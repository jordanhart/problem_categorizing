{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A seriously capable and enjoyable camera.", "Author": "Anthony Pantliano \"The Photo Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R34N2BVQJLJSLK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(I'm putting a quick update at the top, for those who don't get a chance to read all the way through.  As of 03/03/2014 my 7D is still working perfectly, and only has slight cosmetic wear on the mode dial, where the rubberized coating is coming off.  The camera is a bit over 4 years old at this point and I still love it.)The Canon EOS 7D is Canon's semi-pro / enthusiast digital crop sensor SLR.  It's a terrific SLR that shines in photo quality, control placement, speed, and viewfinder size and coverage.First, let me tell you a little about myself so you can gauge what my expectations for the camera are.  I'm strictly a hobbyist photographer and use my camera a couple of times a month at museums, outdoor parks, and vacations.  Besides photos of my dog, my photography consists primarily of static subjects.  This is my second SLR.Enough of me, onto the camera.  The 7D is a fairly bulky SLR and dwarfs \"entry level\" models such as the Olympus E-510 (see my photos), though it's no bigger than Nikon's D300s.  With that said, it's not uncomfortably large and is easy enough to carry around all day.  Build quality is terrific and the camera has a solid, luxury feel to it.  The 7D fits very well into my average sized hands and, with the kit 28-135 lens, is nicely balanced.  All the buttons are easy to reach and, if you've used a Canon camera before, easy to figure out.  The magnesium body is sealed against moisture and dust.  The shutter button is well placed and has a nicely defined halfway point.  A control dial is on the back of the camera and behind the shutter button too.  There is also a joystick-like toggle on the back of the camera as well.A large (3\") and high-resolution (920,000 pixel) screen is on the camera back with a secondary status LCD display on the top (with backlight).  The screen is a pleasure to use when reviewing images for focus, and when manually focusing in magnified live view mode.  Compared to the 3-inch 420,000-pixel screen on my Panasonic LX3 it's a definite upgrade, and makes a noticeable difference.The viewfinder is huge and bright and has 100% coverage.  Coming from the Olympus, which has a very cramped and tunnel-like viewfinder, it was a revelation, and was one of the reasons I decided to step up to the 7D.  Also, by using a transmissive LCD on the viewfinder the only markings you see until you confirm focus are for the selected focus method (for instance, a single box when using one focus point, or brackets when using the auto select autofocus method).  Moreover, a composition grid can be imposed on the viewfinder.  The information display on the bottom of the viewfinder is large and bright and contains lots of shooting and camera information.  (Update 05/27/2013: Since I've been trying to shoot manual focus more, I've noticed that the 7D will light up the focus boxes as you manually focus to let you know what part of the scene is currently in focus, at least it does when using Canon lenses.  I can't comment on other lens brands since I only own Canon lenses.  The 7D's huge viewfinder makes it easy to manually focus.)The camera is very responsive and turns on almost instantly.  The sensor cleaning occurs when you turn the camera on or off but can be interrupted during power up.  Focus speeds with the kit lens are very speedy, even in dim light (two 40 watt lamps and a television as the only light sources in a 17' x 11' room).  The 19-point all cross type autofocus is uncanny at picking the correct subject.  If it doesn't get it right the first time it will the second.  I usually set all my cameras to center point autofocus, but the 7D does a great job picking out the subject, so I leave it on fully automatic mode (unless I'm using the 50mm f/1.4 lens, since wide aperture lenses like that can focus shift with such a shallow depth of field).  Live view focusing is not a quick, especially in low light, and I only use live view when I need to shoot at a weird angle and I can't shoot looking through the viewfinder.  Live view can be used with a mirror flip or contrast detection.  The contrast detection mode is fairly pokey, while the mirror flip mode is quicker, but introduces a brief break in the view.  Continuous shooting is available in both a high and a low setting.  High is 8 FPS, while the low speed is 3 FPS.  The shutter sound is nicely subdued and not nearly as noisy as the Olympus' is.Photo quality is terrific.  There are various Picture Styles you can choose to alter the contrast, sharpness, color tone, and saturation of the photos.  At any rate, 99% of the time, colors are natural, exposure is accurate, and dynamic range is great.  At this level of camera, that's expected though.  What I really love about the 7D is the high ISO noise, or lack thereof.  The luxury of feeling confident while shooting at high ISO is priceless.  I've taken a good number of shots as high as ISO 3200 and have no complaints.  Of course there is a bit of noise, and the mushiness that noise reduction brings, but for an 18 MP image at ISO 3200, I have no complaints.  The ISO speeds above 3200 are OK as well, but I'll reserve those for emergency use only, they get fairly processed looking. (Updating this section a bit: Since the 7D is over 3 years old at this point its high ISO shooting is not as good as it once was relative to the competition.  I have a Canon G1 X and the Fuji X100 and they both do a bit better at ISO 1600 and higher.  Having said that I doubt anyone would complain about the 7D's high ISO results, but you should be aware that sensor technology has gotten better since the 7D was introduced.)  The relatively large APS-C sensor not only allows for low noise, but also allows me to produce nicely blurred backgrounds and great depth of field.  I couldn't achieve the same degree of that effect with the smaller 4/3 sensor in the Olympus, and I certainly couldn't do it with my point and shoot cameras unless I was in macro mode.  There is an Auto Lighting Optimizer feature that attempts to correct photos that are hard to correctly expose (e.g. big difference between shadows or highlights in a scene).  It works well for the most part, but, depending on the subject, the differences are very subtle.  There is also an image highlight tone priority option available in the menu system that limits the lowest ISO setting to 200 and helps preserve highlights a bit, but it too, is subtle. (Update 05/27/2013: Having recently decided to try shooting in RAW and editing my photos using Adobe Lightroom 4, I have noticed that it is worth the effort.  If I thought the 7D's jpegs were good, the RAW files, post-processed, are even better.  Using RAW I'm able to pull out details in the shadows and highlights, correct white balance, and remove purple fringing.  Anyone who is hesitant to shoot RAW because it sounds intimidating, just go for it.  You can always have the 7D shoot a RAW + jpeg together if you're cautious.  Thankfully, even shooting that way the 7D is a fast camera.)The HD movie mode is nicely done as well.  You set your focus, either automatically or manually, before you start recording.  You can refocus during recording but you'll definitely notice it.  You can adjust shutter speed, aperture, and ISO in manual movie mode as well.  There is a monaural microphone on the front of the camera, or you can plug in a stereo microphone.  By pressing the shutter button, you can interrupt the movie briefly to take a still photo, similar to Canon's S series super zoom cameras.The 28-135mm kit lens is nicely constructed and fairly sharp from corner to corner.  Purple fringing is not much of a problem in my photos.  The field of view is kind of narrow though.  The lens starts at 44.8mm with the 7D's 1.6x field of view crop factor taken into account.  Without a wide angle it's not an ideal all around lens, but I do feel it's worth the extra money for the kit with this lens.  You end up getting a nice, ultrasonic motor, image stabilized, 4.8x lens for a minimal cost.The only things I don't like about the camera so far are that in auto ISO you can't limit how high it goes (this has been remedied with firmware version 2.0.0 released in August 2012, see below for more details).  The other thing I'm not fond of is the fact that when you're in playback mode the most you can zoom out is a 9-image grid.  With such a large high-resolution screen I would appreciate an index grid playback mode that showed more photos.  Lastly, I find the process for setting the custom white balance a bit long winded.  You have to take a photo of a white reference object then go into the menus to choose that photo as the reference photo.  On other cameras, even Canon's point and shoots, the process is much faster, and it doesn't save the reference photo to your memory card.  It's not the worst system, and I have become very quick at it, but it could be better.All in all... a phenomenal semi-pro SLR.  The Canon 7D covers all the bases.12/17/2009 Update: I found a nice case for the 7D which fits the camera with kit lens quite well.  It doesn't fit much more than that, but it's a good case if you don't carry too many accessories with you.  It's the Lowepro Topload Zoom case.Lowepro Topload Zoom 1 Camera Bag (Black)12/19/2009 Update:  You can change the depth of field preview button to switch to another autofocus mode when you hold it down, instead of doing a depth of field preview.  I find this very useful since I hardly ever use depth of field preview.  Now if I find that the autofocus is consistently not picking the right subject for a shot, I simply hold down the depth of field preview button to have it temporarily switch from auto select mode to spot focus mode.  Very convenient.01/04/2010 Update:  Just got back from a trip to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.  The 7D was a joy to use.  I took about 160 photographs.  Of those only 4 or 5 are out of focus due to camera error.  The low light performance continues to impress me.  I took many photos at ISO 1600 through 3200 and all of the photos are completely usable.  In the large \"Sea Life\" and \"African Mammals\" rooms I was able to take sharp pictures of these very dim rooms while shooting handheld at ISO 3200 and no flash (see pictures).  Anyone who has visited these exhibits knows how challenging they can be to shoot.10/20/2010 Update:  I am still loving this camera.  No problems to report.  In fact, I was a little miffed when Canon introduced the 60D because it seemed like I could have saved some money by buying that, however, one of the students in my digital photography class bought one, and while it is a nice camera, the build quality and design are nowhere near the standards on the 7D.  Still happy with my purchase.04/05/2011 Update:  Still no problems to report with the camera.  I took it out after a recent snow storm when it was still flurrying and it survived just fine.01/02/2012 Update: Still no problems to report with the 7D.  I continue to recommend it.06/13/2012 Update: The camera still works wonderfully.  I've purchased the Canon 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM lens to replace the kit lens as I was looking for something sharper and a bit wider, and the 24-105 does indeed deliver.  Build quality and sharpness are much higher than the kit lens. Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR Cameras07/05/2012 Update: I picked up Canon's new pancake 40mm f/2.8 lens and it makes a great addition to the 24-105 lens.  It's small, sharp, and quick to focus.  It really does make a huge difference in the 7D's weigh and size and makes carrying the camera on a long hike easy. Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM Lens08/15/2012 Update: I just installed Canon's firmware update version 2.0.0.  The update improves many things; maximum RAW burst of 25 images, in camera RAW editing, JPEG resizing, image rating, maximum auto ISO setting, audio level adjustment in movies, GPS compatibility, file name customization, faster scrolling of zoomed images, and quick control screen during playback.  The firmware was easy to install and download and took only a few minutes.08/20/2012 Update: I just picked up Canon's 50mm f/1.4 lens for low light shooting, and it is indeed a great low light friend.  The angle of view is a bit tight, but it produces sharp photos with shallow depth of field and nicely blurred backgrounds, especially at f/2.0 and wider.  Also, the camera is still working like new and I have no mechanical problems to report.  However, a bit of the rubberized coating is coming off of the mode dial.  It's very subtle though, and completely cosmetic. Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM Standard & Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras10/25/2012 Update: I got Canon's 60mm EF-S macro lens and it's a great macro lens.  Sharp, small, and quick to focus.  I recently took the 7D and my 4 lenses with me to Walt Disney World, took over 1000 photos, and the camera and all the lenses performed great! Canon EF-S 60mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR Cameras04/25/2013 Update: I've also purchased Canon's 28mm f/2.8 IS USM lens and it's a nice compact option that gives the camera a normal view (45\u00ba) and has the benefit of an image stabilizer.  It makes a great all around / museum lens.  It's very sharp and quick to focus. Canon EF 28mm f/2.8 IS USM Wide Angle Lens05/28/2013 Update: I purchased Canon's 70-300 IS USM lens and it makes a decent telephoto option at a great price.  It's not as sharp as Canon's L series telephoto lenses, but it's a great option for those who don't do frequent telephoto work. Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR CamerasP.S.:  Sorry for the long review.  There is a lot to cover, and even so I may not have gotten everything.  If you'd like to know something I didn't cover, feel free to leave a comment and I'll answer it as quickly as I can.  Also, I will update this review as needed based on any new experiences I have with the 7D.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Does the 7D beat full frame cameras?", "Author": "Abdulrahman Aljabri", "ReviewID": "R21UDHF662K69V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No, but it's so good that one starts to contemplate this question, which was never the case before the 7D was introduced. Both systems, crop and full frame, have their pros and cons and place in photography. But before I get into that let me say I have not been as excited about a camera since the introduction of the 5D MK I four years ago. That's because the 7D raises the crop camera bar to the point where crop users will not feel at a disadvantage to full frame camera users, especially if coupled with awesome ef-s lenses such as the 17-55 f2.8.How so? The 7D sets a new standard in four major ways.1. It produces whopping 18MP pictures, which are just 3MP shy of the current top of the line full frame Canon cameras. Just few years ago most pros were producing stellar results using the 1Ds MKII 16MP camera. Now you have more MPs in a crop sensor, that's a major achievement. This achievement translates into bigger prints and, perhaps more importantly, cropping power. Out shooting wildlife with a 300mm instead of 400mm? You can crop the 7D files down to 50% of their original file size and still obtain sharp pictures. It's just not that easy with the 1D MK III 10MP files.2. Many worried that extra MPs in small crop sensors would translate into nosier pictures, but the amazing thing is that this camera produces images with what seems to be less noise than the 1Ds MKII. The noise level is very good. At ISO 1600 I still prefer pictures coming from my 5D MKII, but below ISO1600 they are very close. Frankly, I can go with either camera because most of my professionally shot portraits and product pictures are shot at ISO100. At ISO100 both produce very clean files and are practically indistinguishable.3. Focus is the one area that was lacking on the previous 1.6 crop Canon cameras and this camera changes that. It's not a 1D in focus speed and accuracy, but it's the next best thing compared to them. It's faster than the Canon 5D MKII, which is known to be slightly faster or around the focus performance range of the 50D and 40D.4. The drive chain is fast, so fast it's beyond anything I needed in my professional work in portrait, commercial, and product photography. Going through pictures taken at 8fps produces very little difference from frame to frame. One probably has to shoot a very fast moving subject/object to see the advantage of such fast drive system.There are obviously many other things that I have not covered in this review. But based on the above, all I can say is that this camera has really raised the bar for all cameras and made it much more affordable to obtain a professional level camera for all types of photography. If you were considering buying the 5D MKII as an upgrade give this camera a test because it might be all you need.As for the advantages of crop cameras I always find it odd that casual users who shoot many things but focus on landscape think they need a full frame to realize their potential. Crop cameras such as the 7D and 50D are fine for most users and offer many advantages including:1. greater depth of field at lower aperture for landscape photography2. greater tilt and shift effect because of sensor size relative to effect (8mm in shift is greater in effect relative to a 22mm sensor compared to a 35mm sensor)3. greater magnification with micro lenses and extension tubes because of smaller sensor (1:1 in full frame equals 35mm, 1:1 in crop equals 22mm)4. smaller lighter lenses with wider aperture that achieve greater reach (such as the 17-55 2.8 vs the 24-70 2.8 similar reach but much lighter and smaller)Traditionally the three areas full frame cameras outshine crop cameras are a bigger brighter viewfinder, shallower depth of field for portrait photography, and better ISO performance, which on the last point the 7D has proven not be an issue anymore.And for the second point really, most beautiful low depth of field portraits are done around f2.8-2.0 in full frame (going wider will make depth of field too narrow to place two eyes in focus). Hence, if one is using a wide prime, a crop sensor will produce the same depth of field at 2.0-1.4. Considering an affordable 50mm f1.4 lens on crop has the same field of view as 85mm lens on full frame there is really no reason to discount a crop camera any more as the 7D levels the playing field.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 7D", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "RMYCS9OSX62PL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well after much deliberation between this and a 5d Mark II i decided to opt for the 7D and spend the extra I save on some nice wide angle lenses. First of all for anyone who is expecting a 1.6 crop camera's image quality to be better than the 5d mark ii you can forget it. The 5D mark ii is a full frame sensor camera and the 7D is a crop, different cameras for different purposes. I know three people who own a 5d mark II, wedding photographer, cinematographer and a landscape photographer. As you can tell, they all need wide angle and good low light performance. The 5D Mark II/other full frame cameras are targeted towards users with wide angle needs. So if you find yourself in a crowded room with little light during a wedding the EOS 7D may not be for you, less you put on a 10-22mm EFS lens which is the widest Canon Zoom Lens for a APS-C camera. (Or 8-15 F4L Fisheye).Image Quality from this camera is amazing, I'll put up some pictures once it stops raining where I live. Detail is very good, and the 28-135 lens accommodates this cameras ability very nicely, however, starting off at 28mm will probably be too long for most people in everyday situations such as those for street photographers. Picking up a 17-55 2.8 lens will probably be highly recommended by many.Build Quality is superb. This \"tank\" of a camera is no light weight and one of the first things you notice when you pick up the camera is the hefty feel you get. Very ergonomic grip and a robust feel all around. Don't expect to have it hanging around your next too long though. Weather seals are improved and you can notice that the area above the viewfinder is much larger thanks to a 100% coverage pentaprism.Autofocusing, now I've read some issues about the 7D's new focusing system such as softness from auto zone focusing and I am also getting some mixed results with that as well, some images ranging from very soft to some being as sharp as single AF select. I will update later as I take it out for more situations. However, with that being said, the camera's autofocusing with the 28-135mm lens is very quiet, very fast and accurate for the most part especially with using the cameras single AF select mode.Battery Life: still on the first charge off the box, taken about 500 test shots and a few seconds of 720p recording, battery life is about halfway.ISO performance. Now here is where many have a bone to pick. I am not afraid to use high ISO as my prints rarely go beyond 11x14. More than often I found myself using nothing higher than ISO 1600 on my girlfriend's 500D/T1i. With the 7D I feel very comfortable using 3200 with about ISO 4000 being my cut off point, that's where the trade offs between detail and noise will become apparent and start to bother me.Overall this camera is a very impressive and I'd give it a rating of about 90/100. It has alot to offer being a HD video DSLR. It'll provide many rebel users enough room to learn and grow. However, I cant stress enough that if you find yourself needing wide angle capabilities and low light performance, saving up for a full frame, it will definitely be worth the wait in the long run. In fact a few 5D Mark I cameras are available for cheaper than the 7D. Without a doubt this is one of the top crop cameras of the market right now. You won't regret buying this camera.*Update* First of all, I've been using the wireless flash with a 430ex II for some portrait photography, it works fine and comes in very handy. Secondly, I've finally had a chance to customize all the settings of my camera, READ THE MANUAL! It's about 250 pages but you'll need to in order to make the most of your camera. Most of it is the usual, but because this camera offers so many different options, reading the latter pages is a must.Firmware release 1.0.9 is out so dont forget to update if you still have 1.0.7.For those of you still wondering if the 7D is worth the upgrade or worth buying over a full frame, keep in mind that Canon just release rebates for some EF and EF-S lenses including the 10-22 and 17-55 2.8; as well as some very popular L lenses. So for those of you debating between a 7D and Mark II, getting a kit and using the money saved for a wide angle will pretty much cover all the focal lengths you will really need.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Should I Buy This Camera?", "Author": "Gatorowl", "ReviewID": "R3RO4U7AC4YK9F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this question is one that most of us ask ourselves when considering a purchase of this magnitude.  The question is not an easy one, and I'm not sure I made the correct decision in purchasing this marvelous piece of technology.  Let me put it in perspective; I am a prosumer camera user.  I love photography and take a variety of photographs including family pictures, sports photography (see photos at smugmug for gatorowl), and casual street photography.  I have owned lots of cameras including film, digital P&S; and DSLRs.  The 7D is my sixth DSLR (including a DReb XSI that I sold after two weeks).  Before the 7D, my main camera was a 40D, which I found to be satisfactory especially the image quality (IQ). The negatives of the 40D are lack of weather sealing, 6.5 frames per second (fps) repeat rate, 1600 ISO max (can be pushed higher) and some focusing issues especially in sports photography.  Of course, when comparing with the the DReb series, these  \"negatives\" immediately become positives.  The 40D has better construction, much faster repeat rate, and much better focussing (the T1i has, arguably better high ISO capabilities). The 40D compares well with the Nikon D90. Both cameras are very close.  The D90 has video, better high ISO performance, and is a little more compact.  However, it is a little slower in repeat rate, and I found selecting D90 focus points a bit on the clumsy side. Anyway, because of lens choices, I decided to go Canon.  The 50D held no allure mainly because it was an incremental improvement. So, I thought my kit was set for at least a couple of years.Notice that in the above discussion, I never talk about IQ. Of all the 10MP or better DSLRs that I have used, there is no noticeable difference in IQ.  However, after the 7D announcement and some of the preliminary reviews, I was convinced that the 7D was a quantum improvement over the 40D in every respect.  I panicked,  sold my 40D and bought a 7D.So, what did I find?  The 7D is a great camera and is a clear improvement over the 40D.  In some respects, it is substantially better than a 40D, but IQ isn't one of those major improvements. If you look at your files at 100%-300%, you will see more detail in a 7D shot.  I have a standard photo that I take in my office when I get a new lens.  I had to blow the photos up to 300% before I could detect differences.  There was more texture detail in the 7D and the contrast and saturation were better.  However, to be honest, it's not clear how much of this difference is attributable to the camera or the lenses (I shot the 40D with a Sigma 70-300mm and the 7D with a Canon 70-300mm IS lens).  Frankly, I'm not surprised. DSLRs are so good right now, differences in IQ at low ISO are marginal.  However,  I do feel confident that I can shoot at 1600 ISO or 2000 ISO with the 7D without a substantial reduction in quality. While I can control noise at 3200 ISO, color saturation and contrast decline more than I like. With the 40D 800 ISO was as far as I wanted to go, but I would push it to 1000 when desperate. The 7D provides is a major ISO gain.I really love the 7D focus system.  I don't know if it is as good as the Canon 1D series, but it is so, so much better than the 40D.  By focusing on the exact point in a field, I feel like my creative options are substantially expanded. I was frequently frustrated by having the wrong part of my picture in focus.  This need never happen with the 7D.The 8fps repeat rate is a nice bonus.  It just raises the probability that the exact frame you want will be captured.So, the question is should you upgrade?  You have to decide whether you can afford it; so my advice assume that you can afford the camera, but are looking for the camera that best matches how you shoot.If this is your first SLR (film or digital): I'd recommend  starting with a Canon T1i or Nikon 90D.  The 7D is an extremely complex camera that will take many hours to learn and dozen of hours shooting to master. Unless you have the time to invest in such a camera it will just be a source of frustration.  Unlike almost every other camera I've owned, the user will obtain disappointing or bad results unless s/he truly understands this equipment.  By contrast, you can take other DSLRs and just start shooting.  Unlike the other cameras, the 7D has no scene modes.  With other DSLRs you can take your time and gradually learn  the more sophisticated capabilities.  Most importantly, the quality of your pictures will be just as good.If you are moving up from an entry level DSLR:You need to ask yourself why you are moving up?  If you are dissatisfied with the IQ, then the 7D is not your answer. Using the 7D, it will take a lot more work (initially) to become proficient.  However, if you need a faster framerate, better high ISO performance (although the T1i and D90 are very good for high ISO), long for a better focussing system, or shoot in the rain or the beach, then the 7D might make sense.If you are moving up from a mid-level XXD or Nikon D300:As before, you're getting very little IQ improvement (wildlife photographers claim they can use the extra cropping capability, but I'm not convinced it's substantial).  Buy the 7D because the features provide you with value. Also, I would seriously discourage anyone from switching from a Nikon D300 to a 7D.  There has to be an absolute must-have 7D feature for you to make that leap.As for me, I don't regret this purchase.  I'll never say never, but I'm hoping that the 7D will be my last crop-sensor camera. I love the flexibility and expansion of creative options  that the new features allow me. It's a wonderful camera.  I'm looking forward to spending many hours becoming intimately acquainted with its capabilities.UPDATE: December 2010:I guess one should never say, \"never\" since I've purchased (and sold) two crop-sensor cameras.  Since writing this review, the major camera companies have released several cameras in the crop-sensor arena, so I thought that I'd update my review.  In terms of best all-around crop-sensor camera, nothing released since the 7D beats Canon's offering.  However, the more recent releases are in some cases marginally better than the 7D on certain dimensions.I'll start with the T2i.  It's a great little camera, which is virtually a twin to the T1i but with some updates.  Whether these updates are significant depends on how you shoot.  The two biggest improvements that the T2i has is its video and jPeg quality.  The T2i has the 7D's 18MP sensor, so raw image quality should be virtually identical.  However, the low-noise, high-ISO jpeg samples I've seen have been truly amazing.  Canon has definitely improved the jPeg engine with this camera.  Therefore, if you are on a budget and don't want to bother with raw, the T2i or its bigger sister, the 60D, are attractive choices.  The  T2i's video is comparable, if not better than the 7D's, so if you want video that is a nice improvement over the T1i, then the T2i is a good choice.  The one major T2i flaw is the AF system. It is the same AF system as previous Rebel generations and is clearly inferior to the 7D.  The lack of AF flexibility and accuracy on the T1i drove me crazy, so I sold my copy.  There were too many missed shots, and I found that it just didn't work well as a backup.  I fear that the T2i shares this flaw.Which brings me  to the 60D.  Canon has positioned this camera as a replacement for the the 50D, but others have labeled it an upgrade for the Rebel series.  I think that both views are correct. Compared to the 50D, the camera has a slightly slower continuous shooting rate, less metal construction, and no micro-lens AF adjustment, but it has video capabilities, a swivel LCD (great for video but also for taking still shots at odd angles).  Compared to the T2i, it is bigger (similar in size to the 50D), has a more solid feel to it, much better AF (similar to the 50D but not as good as the 7d), and much faster continuous shooting. Personally, if I hadn't already purchased the 7D, I would be a 60D customer.  It's IQ is similar to the 7D (jpeg, almost certainly better), and the AF is adequate for my needs.This brings up the Nikon D7000, which is currently the rave.  It is a D90 replacement and adds some nice improvements including weather sealing, much improved AF, 100 ISO (the D90 started at 200), micro-lens AF adjustment, enhanced video, improved IQ, and greater resolution (16MP). The IQ improvements is the feature that gets the most press. the D7000 most likely offers the best crop-sensor IQ available 2010-11.  However, for most purposes, most of us won't notice the difference between pictures taken with comparable quality lenses from any of these camera.  Where the D7000 shines is in the quality of noise in shadow and dark areas and in low-light shooting.  The D7000 provides a greater capacity to \"push\" the shadows giving greater dynamic range to those who work in raw.  And ISO 3200 shots retain noticeably more color and dynamic range with less noise than the Canons.  While it's noticeable,  the difference may require near pixel-peeper scrutiny to see. While these features are significantly improved, they are still not at the same level as the better full-frame cameras, but it is at a level that makes low-light shooting and dynamic range less of a reason to consider full frame.Thus, for anyone with a significant investment in Canon lenses, there is no reason to switch.  The 7D is still the best available crop sensor camera for Canon shooters, but the 60D is more than adequate for anyone who doesn't absolutely need the 7D's pro-level features.  The T2i is great for anyone on a budget, but if you can stretch a bit, I'd recommend the 60D.  You will be able to grow with it and will find little in it to frustrate you. It is a great all-around camera with very few compromises. E.g., I am yet to micro adjust my 7D for any of my lenses.  I'm either very lucky or not that picky.For someone starting out, the decision is harder.  the D7000 is a fantastic update for anyone shooting Nikon's entry-level cameras, but it is not a must-do update for D90 users.  The D90 is a great camera that still meets my needs and the D7000 improvements are nice but not essential unless one is shooting at a pro or semi-pro level.  For a new user, the $1199 price is awfully high for a first camera, especially when there are so many good lower-priced alternatives (look elsewhere for reviews of NIkon's entry level offerings).  If someone is an enthusiast and is trying to decide between the D7000 and the 7D, I think that the cameras are sufficiently close that the decision should be made based on lenses that you want to use.  All in all, this is a great time to purchase a crop-sensor camera.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect advanced DSLR for Action Photography", "Author": "Enche Tjin", "ReviewID": "R3T9899MU9T6MG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon 7D is an advanced Canon EOS DSLR camera designed primarily for sports and action photography. EOS 7D is a step up (not replacement) of Canon 40D and 50D. It has similar body like 40D/50D but the buttons and switches has been repositioned for better accessibility.There are plenty of improvements from 40D/50D line, such as improved image resolution (18 mp), better noise handling and latitude, full HD video recording, 8 fps continuous shooting and improved weather sealing.Canon 7D weights 900 g or just 90 g heavier than 50D, and has exact dimension 148 x 111 x 74 mm (5.8 x 4.4 x 2.9 in) as 50D. It is make from magnesium alloy body which is lightweight and durable. Unlike entry level cameras, 7D is weather resistant.Canon 7D has two main dials (one thumb dial and one round dial), an 8 ways joystick and plenty of dedicated buttons and switches. It has dedicated live view button for still or video recording. It also has Q menu, which enable you to see and change popular setting such as exposure compensation, image quality, etc.7D also has camera mode dials which include full auto, creative auto (CA), P, Tv, Av, M, Bulb and three custom setting. There are no scene modes which are popular in entry level DSLR and compact cameras.I find finding and changing setting in 7D is easy and fast. Maybe this is due because I used Canon 40D for about two years. If you are new to Canon advanced DSLR, it might take a while to get use to, but it will not be hard.IMAGE QUALITYMany cynics complain about Canon decision to increase its image resolution. Most photographers afraid that noise will be awful in images taken in high ISO setting. However,  I found that this is not the case. Image quality and noise are excellent up to ISO 3200. ISO 6400 is very acceptable especially after you remove the color noise in software like Adobe Lightroom 3.18 megapixel is great, however it has a couple consequences. First, the filesize is huge event in JPG. Average file size is around 10-15 megapixel (L quality). Second, it requires an excellent lens to take advantage of the resolution or to make it tack sharp.18-135mm LENSUnlike Canon full frame or APS sensor cameras, Canon 7D is compatible with any Canon EOS lens, including EF-S and EF lenses.  In this review, I used Canon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS. This lens is quite good for walk around lens due to its focal length (equivalent to 28-216mm).It is wide enough for to capture building, and long enough for candids). Image stabilization feature is helpful up to 3-4 stops. The lens does not have USM / Ultrasonic motor, so it produces a bit of noise when focusing. However, focusing speed is very good either for still or moving subjects.Bokeh / out of focus rendition is soft and pleasing. It is much pleasing than regular 18-55mm VR kit lens. However, it depth of field is still quite large because of the sensor size and big maximum aperture.To get a very sharp image and get full advantage of Canon 7D  18 mp sensor, better lenses are recommended, such as Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras or Canon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM UD Wide Angle Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras. Canon L series lenses are also recommended.AUTO FOCUS PERFORMANCECanon has improved its auto focus system from 9 points (40D/50D line) to 19 points system. With the additional all cross type AF points, auto focus is fast and accurate. New to AF system is Zone system.Zone AF is Automatic AF point selection, but restricted to a small cluster of AF points in the viewfinder. By grouping several AF points in a cluster, it become easier and more accurate in tracking fast and unpredictable moving subjects such as sport photography. In short, AF system are much better than Canon previous DSLR cameras.To learn more about this auto focus sytem, Canon has provide a tutorial videos and descriptions.There are plenty to like about Canon 7D+ Many dedicated buttons, easy and fast to change settings+ New AF system works very well, simple and customizable+ Noise is very well controlled up to ISO 3200, 6400 is acceptable+ Big and bright viewfinder with 100% coverage+ Excellent 8 fps continuous shooting+ Sound of the shutter click is soft, and low. (not \"ka-ching\")+ Auto ISO works a lot more accurate than in 40D+ New Quick Menu make reviewing or changing setting easier+ 5 stops exposure compensationOn the other hand, these are what I don't like about 7D- No Auto ISO limiter like in Nikon cameras or Canon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only)- Auto ISO is limited only to ISO 3200- Relatively big and heavy- No dedicated button for exposure compensation (you need to go to Q menu to change it)- Auto focus in live view is a joke, it takes up to 3 seconds to lock focusCOMPETITORSNikon D300s 12MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)Nikon D300s is an arch rival of Canon 7D and the only one at this moment. It fell short in some areas such as image resolution (18 mp vs 12 mp), and video recording (full HD vs 720p). However, D300s has some unique feature such as 51 AF points and dual card slots (Compact and SD card).CONCLUSIONI highly regard Canon EOS 7D as the almost perfect advanced camera today and it is quite hard to imagine what could still be improved in this camera. It has several downside such as Auto ISO is limited to 3200, and AF in live view is still very sluggish. Sports and action photographers will love this camera.Subjective Rating - Relative to advanced DSLR cameras of 2010Image Quality : 5/5Features : 5/5Performance : 5/5Body and Handling : 4/5Value for Money : 4/5For image samples and ISO comparison, or other reviews, please visit my blog.

The 28-135 USM lens which comes with the other kit is probably a better lens BUT the EF-S 18-135 is more versatile. The 18-135 is WAY wider and just as long. The lens makes a little more noise and the manual focus ring does rotate while auto-focusing. That said, the image quality is far better than I thought it would be. I wasn't planning to use the kit lens much. I have other lenses to use with my 7D, I have found myself using the 18-135 more than I thought. The image quality is surprisingly great! The focusing ring rotating while auto-focusing has been a non-issue. It has not even been a concern. The 18-135 has better image quality than the 18-200. I think it's one of Canon's best all=around lenses now that I have used it for a few weeks. I am glad I chose this kit over the 28-135 because of the ability to go wide if you need it.Enough about the great lens. The 7D has been great! Read the reviews on DP Review or TheDigitalPicture for the specifics. I cannot say enough good about the 7D. I came from a T1i and there is NO COMPARISON between the Rebel series and the 7D. It's not even close. The T2i (at the time of this review) is a good alternative to the 7D if you don't have the extra $$ but the 7D is FAR better in so many ways. The feel in your hand, the focusing system, high speed continuous shooting, the ability to customize the buttons on the body to do whatever you want, the electronic level, (use it all the time in VF AND LCD) all of the custom functions, wireless flash control built in, metering system, transmissive LCD viewfinder that looks amazing!..you cannot really compare the 7D to anything except the 5D MkII. The 7D is a better camera than the 5D. The ONLY thing the 5D has is full-frame and I LIKE the crop factor of the 7D. All lenses get in closer and if you want a wider angle, get a wide angle lens like the EF-S 10-22. The APS-C format is here to stay. I got the best EF-S lens (17-55 IS USM) and it's the best lens I can imagine. Canon is showing us the APS-C is going to be around for a long time.The owner's manual is great (like all Canon DSLRs) and the battery life has been spectacular! There is a built in gauge that tells you how many shots you have on the current battery and the quality of the battery. I got an Opteka battery as a spare for less than half the price of the Canon and it has worked fine and charges fine with the included charger.The built in wireless speedlite controller in the 7D is a big plus also. There is no need to get one accessory. It will control off camera flashes.The Canon 7D is a better camera than the T5i (Rebel series)or the 5D IMO. The price is reasonable for what you are getting....A camera you could keep for a long time.One thing to note: when you first get the camera...put the lens on and before you put a battery in....look through the viewfinder. You will be shocked, it needs power from the battery to work. Without power, the VF looks dark and cloudy. It has an LCD so you can overlay grid lines, focusing aids, and the electronic level inside. I didn't know this when I looked at the 7D at my local camera shop. I almost didn't buy one because I thought the VF was terrible. It turns out it's because there was no battery installed at the time!This \"review\" is not very well done and a little random, but I really wanted to let everybody know that this kit with the 18-135 is nothing short of great! I would highly recommend it to anyone. If you are a pro, this lens is not good enough for you, but it's good enough for most, and WELL worth having around even if you are a pro or aspiring pro. It's SO versatile. LOVE IT.The 7D is one of the best cameras in the world for any price at the time of this review. It's a little expensive for some, but worth it. Get one and find out.Update: 11/17/10 - I ended up getting the EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS USM lens and it's the best thing since sliced bread. It stays on the 7D almost all the time. I also got an EF 24-104 F/4L and it's amazing. I sold the 18-135 that came with th e camera. I would have sold the 28-135 as well. I would still recommend the 18-135 that comes with this kit....but I would recommend MORE that you simply buy the body only and get a 17-55 F/2.8 IS USM with it. You might as well start off with the best lens ever made for this camera.The 7D: I cannot imagine a better camera for any price. It does everything SO well. landscapes, kids, pets, sports, action, still life, low light, any thing you want to photograph the 7D will let you do WELL. The ISO range and performance has been more than satisfactory. The 7D has not disappointed in any way. It has exceeded my expectations. I am about to do another video on YT under the same user name. I have some videos up there already on the 7D. I will be doing a 90 day review on what I think of the camera. I would highly recommend it still.....even with the upcoming release of the 5DmkIII in a few months. Get a 7D and get this lens or the body and the 17-55 2.8 and you will be very happy.Update: 2/11/11 - I continue to use this 7D. I use the 24-105 F/4L, 17-55 F/2.8, and 100mm macro mostly. The camera is good for any type of shooting. It has great image quality. I have now used it in snow storms, rain, wind, dust, etc. I have had no problems with it. I still plan to use this camera for quite some time. I see no reason to move to anything else. The 7D continues to be one of the best out there. The built in flash control has come in handy, but I got a $40 Cactus trigger (no you cannot buy them here) They work great. I can use the 430EXii anywhere, and off camera. The built in flash has limitations. It does not work outside sometimes if it's too bright or there is too much distance. As I said before, buy body only and get a really good lens. This camera is equipped with a very nice sensor. You need a good lens to take advantage of the resolution. Get a good \"L\" lens or the 17-55 Canon F/2.8 IS. You will not be disappointed. I am curious to see what they do to replace this camera. It will be quite a day when they top the 7D.Update 4-17-11 - I am coming up on a year since I got this combo. Now since the terrible earthquake in Japan the prices are up. I have not seen any issues with the 7D yet. I am still impressed with it. I use it almost every day. I carry it with me in an \"Ape Case\" bag along with my 17-55 F/2.8, 24-105 F/4L, 50mm and 100mm lenses. I love this thing and would still recommend buying it. The replacement will not be out for over a year if even then. Get the 7D. It's still a good buy. The Nikon D7000 is a good alternative now however. Not as good as the 7D in my opinion but newer sensor tech. I would get the 7D body only and use the lenses you already have. If you are getting a 7D as your 1st DSLR it's too much camera for you. Learn on a T1i, T2i, T3i then move up in a few months if you are still learning. Get a 50mm if you don't have any lenses. If you have the money get a 17-55, 24-70 or 24-105L lens. The lens this combo comes with does not match the 7D quality. It will do but the 7D deserves a better lens.Update 9-17-11  - For those of you still reading, I am still using the 7D hard. It has about 15,000-20,000 clicks on the shutter. It still looks and feels new! Every time I use the 7D is like the first time. Nothing is loose, broken, or even worn. The 7D is the type of camera I wish would last the rest of my life. The number of options you have with this camera in the menus, with it's dual processors, speed, ease of use, etc...still make me happy. As you may know already, I sold the kit lens (18-135) I use a 100mm 2.8 macro, 50mm 1.8, 17-55, 24-105 mostly. I have others as well. The 7D is STILL one of the best cameras money can buy for stills AND video. I am very pleased with the image quality, build quality, look, feel, and ease of use. I expect to get 50,000 to 100.000 shots with it. Maybe more. I will use the 7D until I can get better results with something else.Update 6-12-12  - I continue to use and enjoy the 7D. I have gone through many lenses. The 24-105 and 17-55 and 100mm macro are my favorites. For the first time since film cameras, I don't even feel the need to upgrade. The 7D continues to do a great job with any situation. Portraits, still life, action, sports, family events, anything I care to shoot.....the 7D does a great job. I have found that anything under 1600 ISO needs no noise reduction. 3200 and 6400 needs some NR. A new or used 7D would be a good choice. It's a very capable camera here in 2012. Just an update for those interested. I have had a great experience with the 7D.Update 4-15-13 - I am still using the 7D body and plan to keep using it for another year or two. I just can't find any other reason to upgrade. The overall image quality and my ability to capture shots with the 7D to be very good. There are many options in 2013. With the price of the 7D body down a bit.....I would still buy one today. I would get the body only, then find a good lens to fit your style of photography. Pick up a 50mm F/1.8 or 1.4 with the body while deciding what lens (or lenses) you want. The 17-55 is great. The 24-105 is great also. If you want a cheaper option then you might consider the 18-135 with the body. I just wanted to do one last update with a camera now about 4 years old......it's still great. Most cameras would be obsolete now but the 7D is an exception. It was so good when it first came out.....it's still worth buying today. I am still loving it. The 7D has never let me down. Now with firmware version 2.0.3 it has even more features. Amazing camera. I am very happy.Update 8-19-13  - The 2.0.3 Firmware really improves the performance of this camera. You can re-size JPGs, edit RAW images and convert to JPG in camera. Those are just some of the new features. The buffer now holds many more files, both JPG and RAW while shooting at 8FPS. GPS capability has been added. The sensor has been surpassed by new cameras BUT the 7D still has excellent image quality for anything from action, sports, portraits, macro. With this new update I feel like I got a new camera. If you have a 7D update it. If you are thinking of buying one.....it's still a great camera body. A bit over priced now.....but worth it. Canon might be able to do even more with firmware updates in the future with the 7Ds dual processors and excellent quality.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Canon APS-C DSLR Yet", "Author": "Garrett Lowenthal", "ReviewID": "R1ND6FN4MRMTKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By any measure, the new Canon EOS 7D is a worthy successor to the EOS line of APS-C sensor DSLRs.  I believe it finally levels the playing field for many Canon shooters envious of Nikon DXXX shooters.I am an advanced amateur photographer who has owned the 20D for the last 5 years and will use it as a backup body now.  With each Canon announcement of a successor to the XXD line of DSLRs, I was tempted to upgrade but resisted each time up until now.  This was partly due to budgetary constraints, but I felt mostly that each new model was only an evolutionary modification rather than a revolutionary one.  If there's one thing to keep in mind in this fast-moving world of DSLR photography, then it is that DSLR bodies come and go (and depreciate quickly in value, like most electronic goods) but excellent glass will nearly always be sound investments (high-quality lenses maintained in good condition may appreciate in value).The 7D appears to be a game-changer for many Canon photo enthusiasts like myself who prefer or can only afford to shoot with an APS-C sensor body.  Nikon shooters have had an excellent choice of a crop sensor body in the D100/D200/D300 (now D300s), but for Canon shooters, the top-of-the-line equivalent was trailing in the feature set department.  Now most of the features that were absent in the Canon XXD body as compared with their main rival are present in the 7D.Notable features:- 18 MP APS-C CMOS sensor- Dual DIGIC 4 processors (a first for a prosumer Canon DSLR)- Maximum 8 fps frame rate- Maximum ISO 12,800- VF with 100% coverage and 1.0x magnification (a first for a Canon DSLR)- 19-pt AF (all cross-type with f/5.6 or faster lenses)- 63-zone metering system (measures focus, color, and luminance)- On-demand grid lines in VF (a first for any Canon DSLR)- Built-in electronic leveler in 2 planes (a first for any Canon DSLR)- Built-in wireless flash trigger (a first for any Canon DSLR)- HD video in 1080p (30/25/24 fps) and 720p (60/50 fps)I have had the camera for over a week now.  My initial impressions are mostly positive thus far.  Additional thoughts in the form of updates will be forthcoming once I get an opportunity to capture more images under various conditions (indoors/low light, outdoors, action, etc.) and get my act together to type it up.  So far, I believe that the IQ, VF, LCD monitor, and handling are all vast improvements over the 20D.  Taking photos at high ISOs and achieving low noise captures is all the rage these days.  I feel that random photos I've taken at ISO settings up to 1600 are completely usuable.  In the past, I felt comfortable shooting with my 20D mostly south of ISO 400/800.  I shall pixel peep some more and shoot at even higher ISOs to see where the happy medium for me shooting with the 7D lies.  Tolerance for noise, I feel, is very subjective.Limitations:There is a steep learning curve with this camera.  The 7D is packed with new features that I have yet to maximize to my advantage.  Coming from a 20D rather than a more recent line of XXD body makes things even more challenging.  A careful read of the user's manual is critical.If ultimately low noise captures at high ISOs is most important to you, then a FF sensor body is the way to go rather than an APS-C sensor body.  A larger pixel pitch that captures more light (at the expense of lower resolution) will help maintain low noise levels at very high ISOs.  This is a key reason why the small-body FFs, such as the Nikon D700, Canon 5D/5DMkII, and Sony A900/A850, are so revered.  Any of those cameras will likely outperform the 7D at high ISOs in terms of low noise captures.  Moreover, they provide less DoF than APS-Cs at equivalent fields of view.  However, the obvious downsides are their cost and need for big, heavy, and expensive glass.The 7D should not be viewed as an HD camcorder replacement.  Although useful to have and with slightly more shooting options as compared with the version currently offered in the 5DMkII, video capture in the 7D still suffers from lack of continuous AF.  Unfortunately, the jello phenomenon (from rolling shutter) and monoaural sound (external stereo mic input is available, though) make for a less than harmonious package.*** Please be aware that some information about potential problems with the initial batch of 7D bodies has surfaced on photography forums and elsewhere (including here on Amazon).  They include difficulties with the new AF system (particularly in AI servo mode, though some users have had trouble in any AF mode) resulting in OOF photos, as well as ghosting (residual preceding images captured in subsequent images) under certain shooting conditions.  Canon is aware of the latter and will issue a firmware update in the near future.  Meanwhile, a firmware update (1.0.9) has already been issued that fixes problems with suboptimal AF in Live View, among other bugs.  Of note, my copy has no troubles with AF that I have encountered at this point. ***Overall Impression:The Canon EOS 7D is probably the best overall Canon APS-C sensor DSLR currently available.  As far as feature set, it fares extremely well with its slightly more expensive main rival, the Nikon D300s.  In its favor, the D300s has a larger, 51-pt AF system and dual CF/SD card slots.  A scientific shoot-out from a reputable photography website or magazine is sorely needed to help resolve the issue of which has better IQ at high ISOs.  I believe the current lack of Adobe software support for 7D RAW images is the rate-limiting step.With my limited use of the 7D thus far, I have found the camera to be a sheer pleasure to shoot with.  It is a worthy upgrade for 10D/20D users, and probably for 30D users as well.  Shooters of the 40D/50D will need to determine whether the new features are worth dishing out $1700 USD for, particularly during these challenging economic times.  Mostly anecdotal evidence exists so far that suggests there may be a slight improvement in IQ from the 7D as compared with the 40D/50D.  Nikon and other brand photo enthusiasts should weigh the benefits and risks of switching systems.Once Canon publicly addresses any potential problems with the AF system encountered by some users, then I can offer the 7D my highest recommendation.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "I upgraded, should you?", "Author": "Vijay Raghavendiran \"aggievj\"", "ReviewID": "R627NOI9YJLCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It depends!  If you are looking for a comparison between the 5D and the 7D, or if I would have a recommendation of one over the other, this is not for you.  This is written from the perspective of someone who upgraded from the xxD series to the 7D.  Before I go into a detailed review about the 7D and whether you should upgrade or not, a little background about me to help you guys compare it to your situation.  I'm an amateur photographer who does the occasional paid gig, more because I enjoy it rather than for the money.  I have been taking pictures for 4 years now, went through 35mm learning curve and then switched to 20D in Mar 06.  I have shot with the 40D, but never owned the 30/40/50D.  Current lenses include 17-40mm f/4L, 24-70mm f/2.8L, Tamron 28-75 f/2.8, 70-200mm f/4L IS, 50mm f/1.4, 85mm f/1.8, 135mm f/2L & 100mm f/2.8macro. I still have my 35mm EOS 3 which I love and use rarely.Am I happy I upgraded from the 20D?You bet!  I believe that one should invest in lenses first and keep the camera for the last (unless of course, if you are a pro).  It has been a real upgrade from the 20D.  The 7D feels like a slightly bigger and definitely heavier camera than the 20D and I am still getting used to carrying it (this is a review after 24 hrs of the purchase).  When I put the 24-70 2.8L on to it, it balanced just beautifully, yes, both are heavy, but they just beautifully balance each other.  I could carry the 20D with battery grip in one hand. However, the 7D+24-70L is definitely a two handed camera, even without the battery grip. If you are a petite lady or a guy with small hands reading this, you could get some practice lifting 5lbs dumb bells.  No, I am not joking...add the 580EX on top of this, and you will know that I am serious.  I love the way it feels in my hand and the way the camera rests firmly on my left palm while I hold it. So much for ergonomics and body feel.  The neck strap has 7D written on it, which clearly is meant for bragging rights.The IQ is the biggest jump from the 20D (duh!)  Every clickgasm results in a beautiful image, especially when you combine it with a good repertoire of lenses.  Yes, I said clickgasm, because every click is just so much sweeter like a 1000 bag pipers playing in the distant, but just for 1/60th of a second.  Love it.I also love the sensor cleaning functionality, something that was missing in the 20D, which was more prevalent in the 40D & 50D.  It provides confidence and reassurance that this is a good thing for the camera.Oh and talk about the LCD.  A real leap for me, may be less so from the 50D, but I love how the menu functionality is organized.  The resolution of the LCD is outstanding and almost zero glare.  I constantly had that problem with the 20D, but this is a huge improvement and am very happy.  In the 20D, you could'nt tell if an image was OOF, but in this, it is very obvious if there is a shake or OOF.  And the color and contrast visible in the LCD itself is outstanding.  Think of the jump between monochrome computer monitors to the color flat screens...that is what it is for me.  In addition, I also like how the Quick Setting is organized, which displays about all the image settings from exposure scale, white balance, ISO, aperture, shutter speed, metering and all the happy stuff.  The menu is different from the Quick Setting, and that goes into the additional details such as FEB, AEB, ISO expansion, custom functions, Highlight Tone Priority etc.  Very well done Canon, I love it so far.The 8fps is really cool, but I used to have 5 fps in the 20D with the battery grip and used it only while shooting sports, the 8 will come in handy on the rare occasion that I use it for pro sports. And you get that without any additional battery pack, which is good.ISO expansion and noise reduction looks very good at the first glance.  The pictures from the 20D were sub par at 800 and unusable at 1600 and above.  I took a couple of pictures at 3200 with the 7D and am very impressed with the improvement in IQ.  There is a substantial improvement despite the higher MP in the sensor, so very happy with it.  For the thrill of it, I shot a pic at 12800 (posted it in the gallery, the canon 77mm lens cap) and compared it with the same pic at 3200.  I would give a 5 star to canon on this one too.OMG, the 19pt focus, I absolutely love it.  Think of it this way, I learnt advanced photography in the Canon EOS 3 (35mm), which has 45 point focus.  when I bought the 20D, I felt like it was a huge downgrade in focusing ability. It was not cool to loose the ECF feature of the 3 either.  But I love going back to the 19point focus feature...I dont know, something about it is just cooler.  It is most helpful in taking macro shots, which I do a lot of, and I dont have to move the focus and then move the camera ( I know, I know, pathetic way of taking macro shots). Again, glad that finally Canon is bringing this feature in.Two features I am yet to use and will add it to a later review after use are the wireless flash and the HD video.Should you upgrade from the 30/40/50D?I have shot with a 40D and I have to say that the improvement in IQ from 20D to 40D was substantial and a bigger leap than the 40D to the 7D (I have not used the 50D).  If you have $1900 extra and would love to splurge on this, by all means.  The only time I would strongly advise against buying the 7D is if you spent much of your time with your previous DSLR in the basic mode and never in the P, Av, Tv, M modes.  This camera doesnt have any of those modes and is not meant for someone interesting in learning photography, it is meant for someone who knows what they are doing.If you are really interested in shooting HD video in one camera and want to make use of a good collection of lenses for the video, absolutely go for it.  This provides a slightly cheaper option compared to the 5D.  I never even considered the 5D as I knew it was not for me.  I dont know that I will gain value for the additional $800.  So cant help you if you are trying to choose between the 5d and the 7d.The four biggest reasons I can see you going for an upgrade are1. HD video2. Wireless flash3. 19 pt focus4. Weather and Dust sealing that is a part of the xD series.If you are considering an upgrade for the sake of IQ, you may be in for a disappointment.  Dont get me wrong, there is an improvement (my POV is from 40D), but just that the 40D itself is so good that there is little room for Canon to improve.  There are a lot more reasons to upgrade if you are using the 20D or the 30D as I have mentioned earlier in my review.Any complaints with the camera so far?None so far, Im very happy.  Of course, the price could be cheaper, but oh well.  I also wish real estate in California was cheaper, but lets be realistic, Canon is in this business to make money. I noticed that one reviewer had focusing problems, I have had none and am very happy with the camera so far.I will continue posting pictures and additional review points...happy clickgasm!UPDATE AFTER 7 DAYS OF USING THE CAMERA.So far, I have been extremely happy.  If there is something that has consistently wowed me, it is the LCD, amazing resolution, color and clarity in that.  Portraits coming out of this camera are pleasing, more so on the 85/1.8 makes it a great combo.  ISO1600 is usable, I took one or two in ISO12800, which was better in quality compared to my 20Ds 3200.  Not great, but useful to preserve memories.  May not suit professional expectations of quality. I uploaded some of my first pictures, not sure why Amazon is not displaying them (nothing obscene in the pictures).  Definitely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend!", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Should I upgrade?  Um YES!", "Author": "J. Rhodes", "ReviewID": "R3J3W4YLOW6LGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the Rebel XSi and boy what an upgrade it was!  I'm mainly a hobbyist photographer even though my friends all say I should quit my day job (they just suck up because I will shoot their events for free!).  I upgraded from the XSi because I kept finding myself arguing with the XSi over it's light metering, focus points and choice of shutter speeds in Aperture Priority mode.  I can say without a doubt that the 7D out performs the XSi in every way (and it should since it's a semi pro camera while the XSi is a consumer camera!).When I bought the 7D I slapped the 28-135 lens on it (already had it for the XSi) and started shooting, quickly noticing it's much improved light meter.  It blew me away at how perfectly it would calibrate the white balance for every picture and what it was metering the light from.  I was blown away just by that!  After about a week of usage I decided to upgrade to an L lens for both the moisture/dust protection all around and also it give this camera a \"proper\" lens.  It was worth every penny!Matched with an L lens, this camera far exceeds what I was expecting out of it.  I took it to a friends 1st birthday party and shoot the 1 year old using the L lens (17-40 UWA) on full manual at 100ISO, 50 shutter, aperture 4.0 with the 430EX flash and my god, the pictures are gorgeous!  The camera's ability to track faces is spot on, the kid's eyes are sharp, crisp, colorful and full of life.  They just make your heart melt!  I'm sure it helps that this camera has special settings this lens in it's memory and it shows.I have not played around with the video much, not my cup of tea.  However my brother-in-law, who is a video editor, says the ability to capture video at such a short focal length requires thousands upon thousands of dollars in the video world and says that the 7D (and the 5Dmii for that matter) can do what a 10k camera can for a fraction of the price.Another feature which was a welcome upgrade was the weather sealing.  Not that I plan to go into the trenches with my camera but going out to a dusty, muddy farm and taking fall pictures is less worrisome now since I don't have to bother trying to keep my camera away from all the floating dust.This is a phenomenal camera and I highly recommend it to anyone who is into photography as a hobby or a casual professional.  I'm sure a \"real\" pro who lives their life on photography would welcome a full frame body more than the 1.6 crop but for me, I don't care, this camera does everything I want and more!  It's a perfect addition to my ever growing camera bag and has become my one and only camera for which to shoot with.  My poor XSi has been booted from my day bag and sits idle on my shelf collecting dust with it's non-dust protected body.  I wonder if I should sell it before it's too late!", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beginners OK!", "Author": "Michael Guerra", "ReviewID": "R1ZMKDDW053037", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a complete newbie to photography. My sum total of knowledge about photography was: keep extraneous junk out of the shot, fill the frame with your subject, and... that's it. I took pictures with my Olympus C740 UZ in full auto mode, and could not tell you the difference between an f-stop and a flame thrower. However, my plan was to become an accomplished amateur photographer ASAP. Once the camera was on order I got Bryan Peterson's book, \"Understanding Exposure\" and read it cover to cover. Wow! If you consider yourself a beginner, get this book today. Read its' reviews here on Amazon, this is what you need to understand a tremendous amount about photography in, literally,  the first half an hour of reading. So, because of that book, I was not the least bit intimidated by the EOS 7D, and was up and running taking pictures immediately. And, by the way, the mode dial has been in aperture priority, shutter priority, or manual since day one. As far as I'm concerned, \"auto\" and \"creative auto\" don't exist. I went from knowing absolutely nothing about photography to having a firm grasp of the essentials in a week, with this camera and Bryan Peterson's book. As a complement to the camera I also got at the same time Doug Sahlin's book, \"Canon EOS 7D for Dummies\". It is an excellent accompaniment to the camera manual, and, like Peterson's book, full of good general photography basics. If you have anything on the ball at all, you can become a photographer with this camera and those two books. From this base, you can then continue to hone your skills and learn forever. So my point is not to talk about the camera, but to tell any beginner they can use THIS camera starting from a base of no knowledge and with diligent study learn very quickly. If it is in your budget, you don't need to go from a point and shoot to a \"bridge\" camera to a DSLR. If you are serious, want to learn, and have the scratch, you can start right here.I have had this camera for eight days and learned and practiced the following things I never knew in that time: What f-stop is and how it affects depth of field; how to use shutter speed to stop or imply motion; what ISO is and how it can affect picture quality; how white balance works and when and how to modify it; using exposure compensation and exposure bracketing, and how to combine those with filters in unusual lighting situations; when and why to use a tripod with slow shutter speeds; how to take great macros without a macro lens using a 50 mm prime lens and an extension tube; how to use direct flash, bounce flash, fill flash, ring flash, and off camera flash for macros, portraits etc. to eliminate shadows and balance exposures. Why you don't use a wide angle lens for portraits! The list goes on but the point is you can do it too. So don't be afraid to buy a \"scary\" camera, just roll up your sleeves and learn. Also, get a Cotton Carrier to carry the camera around, you don't want this thing hanging on your neck! Cotton Carrier is a vest that securely clips the camera to your chest, it is a necessity in my opinion, put Cotton Carrier in a search engine and peruse his website. I took a \"Macro Walk\" yesterday with it and it is the best! No sore neck.Anyway if you want to know more about the camera itself there is plenty of info here, but I just want beginners to know you can succeed with this awesome machine.", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect camera for wildlife photography", "Author": "Sergio H. Seipke", "ReviewID": "R6N847LS1M2EK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I take photos of birds.  90% of the time of flying birds, mostly raptors -- distant, fast-moving subjects in poor quality lighting conditions.  I fitted the 7D with a Canon 300 mm F2.8 L IS USM telephoto lens.  Also used both Canon Extenders EF II (1.4X and 2X), and sometimes used a light Manfrotto tripod.  Shot nearly 1,000 RAW and JPEG during the first 10 days after getting the camera.  Image quality is outstanding (without the extenders incredibly so).  Focusing speed might be even faster than with my previous camera (40D) but it is still too soon to be definitive.  8 fps burst speed is notoriously faster than the 6.4 fps I was used to.  \"Zone AF\" and \"AF point expansion\" focusing modes (new to me) are very effective for following distant flying birds (better than Spot AF mode, that I used with the 40D).  For closer birds \"Spot AF\" is preferable so one can improve chances of focusing the head/eye.  RAW files are huge (20-24 Mb each) so buy the fastest memory card and card reader you can.  Unfortunately, neither iPhoto nor Snow Leopard read 7D's CR2 format as of 15 Dec 2009.  Photoshop CS4 (properly updated) does though, and so does Canon's included software, of course.  The 7D uses a battery slightly different from the XXD series, so now I need to carry two battery chargers, and my batteries are not interchangeable between cameras.  I also bought the Canon 28-135 mm F3.5-5.6 IS included in the kit, and however a little less sharp than my Canon 50 mm F1.8 EF II, it performs well throughout the zoom range.  If you can afford only one lens this is probably a good choice for general photography, and good value for the relatively little extra money.  Full HD Video is very sharp and colors well balanced.  Nice to have the external mic input.  Best to turn the IS off when shooting video without an external mic or a buzzing noise (the IS drives) will contaminate your sound track.  I still need to run a series of more controlled tests to form a sounder opinion but so far I'm happy with the upgrade.  The 1.6X cropping factor rules out this camera for landscape photography, but the same feature combined with the 8 fps and new AF modes probably makes this camera -dollar for dollar- the best current choice for telephoto wildlife photography.  This is the camera I was waiting for! As simple as that.17 Dec 2009 update.  I updated my software today and both Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5.8) and Snow Leopard (Mac OS X 10.6.2) open and process RAW images (in \"Preview\") taken with the 7D. iPhoto '08 (version 7.1.5) imported RAW images from this camera just fine this time.

I've had it for a few months, upgrading from a Canon Rebel Xsi and finally decided to do a review, now that I have experience with it and really have had a chance to put it through it's paces. I'll try to keep my review based TOTALLY on my own personal experiences, and not just regurgitate the words everybody else has already said about this camera. I'm going to spread this review out into a couple of lists, then a short question and answer section... so here goes!What's hot?* Large, 18 megapixel images* Great low-light performance at high iso's* Fast* Automatic White Balance does a much better job than my Xsi ever did.* Rugged/Solid* Feels very \"significant\" in your hands and comfortable to hold* Automatic Focus is highly configurable to your situational needs and performs VERY well (in comparison to any previous camera I've owned)* Remote flash triggering* Movie modes are neat (I don't play with them much however... I'm more a photographer than videographer)* Most \"professional\" ASP-C sensor camera yet.* Shares batteries with the 5Dmark ii.* Penti-prism 100% view is amazing. Much brighter and more useful, to me, in framing a shot than the penti-mirror design of the Rebel series.* Micro-adjustment for individual lenses is awesome.What's not?* Rebel T2i has it's sensor, iso range, movie modes, a bigger and more detailed screen, and a \"dumbed-down\" version of the 7D's auto-focus... at about $1000 less.* If you're used to a Rebel camera (or point-and-shoot), the weight will be very noticeable after a while.* ExpensiveQuestions and answers:Q: Would this be a \"good camera\" for me to buy as my first step into the DSLR realm?A: No. More accurately... probably not. This camera is complex, and it should be. It's as professional as the ASP-C camera's get... and it's in the xD lineup. If you aren't familiar with basic camera functions... something that takes this many steps beyond \"basic\" will either be frustrating, or wasted by always sitting in the \"automatic\" setting on the dial. I would, instead, recommend you look at the Canon Rebel T2i! It's got many of the specs of this camera, at a much cheaper price point. It's lighter, smaller, and more beginner/intermediate friendly.Q: Should I get this camera over the Rebel T2i?A: Depends totally on your use of a camera. Need something light, friendly, very capable, and a great value? Rebel all the way. Need something with a super-fast shutter, rugged build quality, and a few very advanced features? Go with the 7D.Q: Which lens should I get with the 7D?A: Totally depends on what you want to do and what you need it for. I chose the 28-135mm. So far, it's not a bad little piece of glass. That seems to be about the standard idea on all the \"kit\" lens options. Looking back, I probably could have saved myself some cash by buying the body only and used it to buy some REALLY GOOD glass. The sensor on this camera has an nearly un-satiable hunger for sharpness. You won't see it's true potential without amazing optics.Final word: If you need a blazing fast, rugged, Canon camera and you're willing to really go through it's complexities and wring every last ounce of \"Awesome\" out of it... in the ASP-C format... this is it. If you want to save some money and/or are just getting into the world of DSLR's... I'd pass this one by.

Stephens", "ReviewID": "R3H45DH2ISKVX8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own both the 7D and the 5D MkII. The 5D2 excells at high IQ and great high-ISO performance and the 7D excells at fast focus, bringing the subject closer and getting off bursts of images at high frame rates. Both are very fine all around cameras, but the 7D helps you by filling its viewfinder with a larger image, locking on focus quicker and allowing a much faster burst rate. I've been somewhat amazed at the 7D's perfomance at ISO 6400, but find it second to the 5D2 at ISOs of 1600 and 3200. Below ISO 800 the two perform very closely, but the difference is more noticeable in that 1600-3200 band. Hey, at least we're not talking about shooting birds in flight at ASA 50!The build quality is at the tank level. I've had it out in rain and snow and temperatures as low as -15F. I really like that the 7D and 5D2 share the same battery, so by keeping a charged battery in each body and a spare, I'm never short of power. I often take 1000 images in a day with the 7D and always have plenty of reserves (I hardly ever use Live View). The control layout is slightly improved over the 5D2, with the video operation being much more intuitive.I'd suggest that anyone having IQ trouble with the 7D make sure that they check their micro-focus adjustment and fine tune it to their particular lenses. There is quite a range of potential adjustment, which might explain the trouble that a few seem to be having. (Mine required no micor-adjustment).", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "impressions of the 7D . . . very solid, lots of bang for your buck along many fronts . . .", "Author": "trebe", "ReviewID": "R17P61OK2K27N8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The EOS 7D, Canon's latest prosumer digital SLR, is a major step forward, incorporating some features found on the 5D Mark II, as well as some that are totally new to Canon's prosumer line.  With much that is new, even those familiar with Canon SLR's, should be prepared to spend some time frequently consulting the often confusing manual.Looking to upgrade from the 40D, I passed on the 5D Mark II, because its 3.9 frames per second shooting rate is inadequate for shooting sports.  With the new features and a shooting rate of 8 FPS, the 7D was my choice.  These are some early impressions of the 7D.Housing, Controls and Display:The 7D's heavy-duty, dust and weather resistant housing, is made of lightweight magnesium, and feels rock solid.  The 7D has a new arrangement of controls for users to get familiar with.  The mode dial is similar to the 5D Mark II (no 'Sports', 'Portrait, 'Landscape', etc).  The power switch has been relocated to behind the mode dial.  The video recording button is on the back, located on the right side of the eyepiece, similar to Canon's 'S' series cameras.  Shutter noise is quiet, similar to the 40D.  Image quality and color rendition on the LCD display is good, and looks similar to the 40D.  The display brightness can be set manually, or the camera will adjust it automatically.Pressing the 'Q' button activates the 'Quick Control Screen', a menu where a number of settings can be conveniently adjusted.  The joystick is used to toggle between functions, and settings are adjusted the normal way, using the Main and Quick Control dials.  Once you get used to it, the 'Q Menu' may become your preferred method for adjusting your settings.Autofocus:As I find that Canon's nine point focusing pattern is often inadequate, the 7D's improved autofocusing system was of special interest.  For those unfamiliar, the AF pattern is eight points in a diamond shaped layout with the ninth point in the middle of the diamond.  The new 19 point adjustable autofocus system basically adds points in the interior of the diamond area.  The actual area of coverage, does not appear to have increased.  Being center weighted is understandable, but expansion beyond the diamond area is arguably more useful than just increasing the number of focus points within the diamond area.The rule of thirds is a useful guide for composing an image, however attempting to implement this rule using the diamond shaped pattern is often difficult.  Say you want to focus on something in the top left quadrant of the frame.  One method is to lock focus on the area, reframe, and then shoot.  This works if the subject is stationary, however this method becomes more problematic for moving subjects.  If only there was a focus point nearby.  Increasing the concentration in the central area makes some sense, but I really wish they had expanded the overall area of autofocus coverage as well.That issue aside, performance of the new autofocus system appears to be a big improvement over the 40D and 50D.  The 19 individual points, are also grouped into 5 multipoint zones, which can be selected using  the Zone AF function.  This feature is very useful for many applications, like sports or group shots.  Shooting college basketball, focus lock using Zone AF was very good, much superior to single point focus.  The high speed continuous shooting mode (8 FPS) is smooth like butter.  The shutter button quite sensitive, but keeping the camera steady in burst mode takes practice.Remote Triggering and Wireless Flash:A very convenient feature that was a long time coming to Canon's prosumer line, is the ability to remotely trigger the 7D using Canon's RC-1 remote, or other inexpensive remotes.  The 7D can also be triggered by Pocket Wizards, via the N3 terminal.  The integral flash is essential, and the 7D also has the capability to wirelessly trigger compatible Canon speedlights, eliminating the need for the ST-E2 transmitter, and makes creative flash photography more convenient.Live View, Video, and Memory:Photography via live view mode, is similar to a point and shoot, although the 7D is a little heavy to be holding in front of your face.  As claimed by Canon, the image taken seems to be 100% of what appears in the LCD display.  I use live view for rough framing when the camera is on a tripod.  For HD video a fast card is a must, Canon recommends using a CF card with a transfer rate of 8MB/second.  Shooting video is simple, though the results can be kind of spotty.  Check YouTube for video reviews of the 7D, and examples of videos shot with the 7D.  Picture quality can be quite good, although skin tones may not be accurate, and AF is not continuous.  You will need ample memory to shoot video, as a 4GB card holds about 12 minutes of content.  For images at highest image quality (RAW + JPEG), the camera reads that a 32 GB card will hold about 960 images, an 8 GB card about 240, and a 4 GB card about 125.ISO:As the 40D tops off at ISO 1600, the 7D's ability to shoot up to ISO 6400 is mind-blowing.  The noise in test shots at ISO 4000 and above, were not bad.  I rarely exceed ISO 800, but it is something I will now look into further.LP-E6 Battery:Canon's LP-E6 batteries have a serial number, and the 7D will keep track of the battery's power level, and number of shots taken.  Canon continues to take measures to discourage the use of third party products.  Non-Canon versions of the LP-E6 battery will work in the 7D, but are not recognized, and read as `empty' on the battery meter, with no data available.  Having used non-Canon BP-511 batteries for years in various Canon SLR's, without any problems, I do not believe that they are inferior or dangerous.  You can pay $60 for the Canon LP-E6 if you wish, but you can get generic LP-E6 batteries for as low as $10.In these hard economic times, value and quality are even more important.  The 7D does cost more than the 40D and 50D when they debuted, but it is worth it.  The 7D is better built, has many more standard features, and produces better images.  It appears that Canon is very serious about competing with Nikon, which should benefit users of both brands.  It will take some time for most users to begin tap into the potential this camera offers.  Have fun taking some great images.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Everything but the Image Quality", "Author": "Richard Cabrera \"richcz3\"", "ReviewID": "R19K8WYNDS412N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a 50D and jumped at the opportunity to pick up the 7D. The 50D is by no means a slouch. The simple reason for going with the 7D is that it's feature set offers a marked improvement and not just for its price point.Although the 7D is not a follow up model to the xxD line, I make some comparisons to the 50D where warranted and because that's the camera I've been using.Battery LifeBattery life bests that of the 50D. So in straight photography, battery life does last longer. Where battery life is shortened comes in the use of the 7D's video function. The camera defaults to \"Live View\" for composing and shooting.This added video function will wear through a battery life at an increased pace making having an added battery pack essential. Note the 7D uses the same battery as the 5D Mark IIControls and Button LayoutThe control/button layout is well though out. The left rear border gives quick access to the most important features with the press of the thumb. No need to reposition the camera in the hands to review/delete images or access menus.There is also the option to customize button functions to simplify feature access just as one can do with the 50D. The 7D has a dedicated Live View button incorporated with Video switch. This eliminates menu access and make transitions while shooting almost effortless.LCD ScreenThe LCD screen when compared to the 50D appears a bit dimmer. To its benefit the 50d is equipped with more anti-reflective coatings whereas the 7D appears devoid of any. In bright lights or sunlight, the default luminance of the 7D can make it a task to judge images taken or evaluate/compose your shots in Live Mode. The only way to counter this is to increase the brightness in the menu system - of course the hit on battery life.AF PointsAlthough the 19 point system is a nice added addition. Much of the options appear better used in staged/static/studio environments. However the Spot AF, Single Point AF, and AF Point Expansion offer a wider range of options for catching subjects in motion or picking subjects out from foreground/background.Autofocus SpeedThe AF is measurably quicker than the 50D. Having used the 7D in the same environments as the 50D, the 7D easily locks in the AF solution fasterShutter SpeedShutter speed is phenomenal. It is very welcome when taking shots in action environments wildlife/sports. When taking pictures with long lenses on the fly without a tripod, having the extra frames captured really makes the difference.Image QualityWhen compared to the 50D - the increase in image quality is questionable at best. This almost feels like deja-vu, when the image quality of the 50D was questioned whether it was actually better than the 40D.I've since read in reviews that the soft focus effect can be attributable to the 7D's higher quality Antialias feature. That sounds like a quite a reach for an excuse as the result is counter productive given the cameras specs. If the AA is the problem, there should be a User selectable option to kill it.It appears Canon seems to be on the road to higher megapixel counts without working on tightening up the sharpness and detail in captured images. Canon is on a campaign for increased resolution at the deference of detail and definition which defeats the purpose of increased MP.Using the 100-400mm L f4.5-5.6 Lens, images are no sharper than those taken with a 50D at any given setting. Given the 3MP count advantage to the 7D there is virtually no visible gain. One could upscale the image size from a 50D camera in Photoshop to compensate the additional MP. In doing so you wont see much if any quality difference between the 50D and 7D.Using the EF 16-35mm L f2.8 in low light scenarios, the camera performs admirably. Very sharp vibrant color pictures. Used for both pictures and video the 7D and this lens were well suited for the task. As with the 50D, it is advisable to go with higher quality glass (L lenses) to make up for diminished returns in the megapixel increase. If there are any similarities with the 50D and 7D it is on the marked lapse of gains with increased megapixels. If high ISO settings are your target, the 7D offers a bit better performance @ 2400 and above.HD VideoThe added benefit of high quality video is very welcome option. Being that it's less than elegant to operate various function on a DSLR is almost a given.The video output from the 7D is very solid. Very sharp, color depth, and great contrast at various ISO ranges. In real low light anything above 3200 will result in grainy and other unwanted artifacts.In Manual mode having access to Shutter, Aperture, and ISO really give the user allot of control over the subject. No frames dropped means nice content from which to edit. The downside of doing video with the 7D or possibly any DSLR is the awkward control placement. Any adjustments after the start of video taping means pressing and rotating of dials or adjusting zoom or focus. All this means is the camera will jostle about. Adjusting the shutter or ISO via the dial and you will hear the click of the dial in the video which is not subtle in the least.Also composing and manual focusing through live view will present its own challenges. Holding the camera at a distance to see Live View and making adjustments isn't practical. Video on the 7D lends itself better to planned shots or minimal variance from the primary subject. Getting zoom, focus, and other essential settings in place is almost imperative before beginning to shoot.In SummaryMany of the 7D's features really are nice advancements for any Canon line. Given the price point and the Nikon 300 market it's designed to compete with, it's a competent build. The features aren't just bullet points and most work well in practice. Where the 7D fumbles is overall image quality. The bump to 18MP really feels much less justified. It really is disappointing to have so much going for it just to come short on something as critical as image quality.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 7D", "Author": "E. Hung", "ReviewID": "R33VVEC4XIHA2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first time writing a product review in Amazon. I want to write this review because the EOS 7D is a big step forward by Canon to address the advanced amateur market not to mention having at last a compelling product to compete head-to-head with Nikon D300 and its more advanced D300s sibling. For more than two years, Nikon has enjoyed such a technical lead that I was constantly yearning for a D300 equivalent body that I could upgrade from my trusty EOS 20D, which I am still using today as a backup body to avoid the hassle of changing lenses. In retrospect, the EOS 20D seems to make me a better photographer as I need to anticipate for the next shot by pre-adjusting all the knobs for proper metering, focus points, and exposure compensation. The substantial improvement in these aspects of the EOS 7D over the 20D gives me the confidence to let my wife use the EOS 7D while I continued to use the old EOS 20D in our recent vacation trip to the Yucatan Peninsula. My wife doesn't like to fiddle with various controls, and she rarely misses any shot because of improper exposure or focusing. In other words, the image results are very consistent. On the other hand, the new focusing system of the EOS 7D requires a little time to get used to. I think I was a little lucky to get a good copy as I have seen some other online user reviews that it did not work for them. At least it works marvelously for me with my EF100-400 F4.5-5.6L IS big gun in birding events.When I purchased the EOS 7D body, I also purchased the EF24-70mm F2.8L lens as a walk around combo. It 's heavy as a dumb bell once I add the 580EX speedlight on top. But that 's the price you pay for with big quality glasses and good weather sealing. Especially with the 7D's 18Mpixel sensor, I figured I would need a good lens with high resolving power. I also tried out my EF28-135mm F3.5-5.6 IS lens, I can see quite bit of difference in high resolution IQ particularly at wide open apertures. Other than that my EFS 10-22mm, EFS 55-250mm, EF50mm F1.4, and EFS 60mm Macro lenses seem to work well with the high pixel count sensor. And don't be surprise that the cheap plastic kit lens EFS 18-55mm IS would also produce decent resolution as well given its nice MTF curves.The video capability of the EOS 7D is not its strength. However, don't discount the usefulness of this feature as the camera is quite capable of capturing high quality HD video if it's used properly and most importantly with patience. First of all, forget about auto mode, it is most desirable to capture video in manual mode to avoid the camera automatically increasing its ISO sensitivity when it points at low light areas. In manual mode, you have full control of shutter speed, aperture, and exposure compensation and it's not as hard as it seems. Ideally, you want to set the shutter speed to 1/60 seconds for silky motion of the subjects and in some cases, you want to set the aperture small enough that you don't have to refocus for any background objects. Otherwise, the background blur resulted from narrow depth of field would seem to introduce compression artifacts when there is lot of motion in the background objects. Hence, good lighting is important to shoot video at smaller aperture to give you more depth of field and clearer background objects. You also may want to turn off IS in your lens to avoid the hunting noise that the built-in microphone would pick up. I 've found that a monopod is necessary if you are shooting video at 50mm or longer focal length. Secondly, I would suggest manual focusing after you let the lens autofocus before you press the video record button. Autofocusing during recording often results in noisy hunting. You may want to invest in an external microphone, but that could make you very standout in the crowd. I was surprised to find that face detection is also possible in video capture mode using the Live View display. I have yet validated the camera actually re-focus accordingly with the faces it detects. But at least I can see the yellow brackets show up on the faces.All in all, I love this camera and enjoy it very much. Hopefully it would last for me for another 5 years. The way I look at it, the camera body is not as important as lenses in terms of investment. My 20D still can produce some amazing pictures with a good lens attached to it. In the past, I have passed up on the EOS 40D, EOS 50D, and EOS 5D MK2. And I can see most EOS 5D MK2 users are now envy with the new focusing system and high frame rate of the EOS 7D. I am not a pro, so the relatively higher ISO noise on the EOS 7D compared with any full frame camera is not an issue for me. The most important thing is that the ISO noise performance of the 7D is much better than my EOS 20D, although I have to say that Canon still has troubles with red color even in low ISO. I did look at the Nikon. During my recent vacation, I had a chance to play with my friend's Nikon D300s. I can tell you that I love my EOS 7D better despite the fact that the Nikon has 51 focus points and a 2nd SD slot. I didn't see any difference in IQ except that my friend's camera seems to overexpose with normal default settings. He's a die-hard Nikon fanboy. And to this day, he is still trying to figure out the D300s menu and why it overexposes. Hopefully this little episode would satisfy you Canon EOS fanboys out there.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Worthy Addition to Canon's Line", "Author": "Number Six", "ReviewID": "RSGK6JWT0U5MK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "added:In response to the reviewers complaining about soft 7D images. ...  If this is soft, I don't need sharp![...]==============================================================================================I don't usually post reviews but given the two one star ratings, I was compelled to do so.I've had my 7D for about a week; only found time for a few, non-rigorous test shots.

Since then I've taken about 20,000 photos, and had to work with Canon's service department along the way. So now's a good time for a review. I've been a serious amateur photographer for more than 50 years. I don't take snapshots; 99% of my photos are taken with the camera on a tripod. I take a lot of pride in my photos, and hundreds of them are published on several websites I own or manage. I wanted a camera that was so good I couldn't blame it for a bad photo, but not so expensive I'd be limited in what other photo-related items I could buy.My intention when buying the camera was mostly bird photography, so I also bought the 100-400 mm L zoom lens. My interests also extend to close ups, and the 60-mm macro lens got added to the package. Since then I've added only two more lenses to my kit: the 10-22 mm EF-S wide angle and a used Sigma 600-mm mirror lens. Accessories? Oh, yes, we have accessories!One problem with APS-C sensors is greater image noise, especially at higher ISOs. The EOS 7D produces very low-noise images at ISO 800, though I rarely go there. While photographing a night-time prescribed fire in Jonathan Dickinson State Park I kicked the ISO up to 6400, and shot with the 10-22 mm EF-S lens wide open (f/3.5 to f/4.5). Those shots were for the web, and even at 1200-px width the noise is bearable. In fact, for something as dramatic as a night-time forest fire the noise seems to add veracity. Most of the time I shoot at ISO 100 or 200, and large prints look wonderful. (Don't handicap yourself with cheap filters or a flimsy tripod. Accessories can add significantly to the start-up costs of a system like this, so figure them into your budget from the beginning. If you're just getting into DSLR photography, stick with the camera and 'kit' lens, and get a high-quality clear or UV filter. I always recomend a tripod, but good ones are pretty expensive. Autofocus and image stabilization may make tripods seem irrelevant, but tripods make you slow down and pay attention to the shot. That would be a good next purchase.)The sensor and in-camera processing are important, but so is the lens. The supplied 28-135 is acceptable, though not on par with better fixed-focal-length lenses. Its greatest fault is the 6-blade iris, which causes sub-par background blur, but I've been able to fix that up pretty well using Photoshop's \"Lens Blur.\" If your program has Gaussian blur and you know how to work with layers, you can fix the problem so most people won't notice, and the lens does have its benefits.For one, it focuses down to about 20 inches (0.5 m), which is very useful if you're a nature photographer. Schneider makes a +2 diopter achromatic (dual-element) close-up lens with the right thread, and that lets me focus down to about 10 inches, even at 135-mm (more than 200-mm equivalent on a full-frame 35-mm camera). (Canon makes an equivalent achromatic +2 diopter lens but at this writing you can't get a new one in the U.S., and used ones are commanding high prices.) I've gotten some astounding photos of dragonflies and other insects with this combination. The depth of field is limited, so you need a tripod, and it doesn't hurt to manually focus.Ah, here's the thing: If you're an automatic-camera type, the 7D probably isn't for you. Yes, it has built-in options that will think for you, but you can get them for less on, say, a 60D or a point-and-shoot. The 7D is a photographer's camera, like a Porsche is a driver's car. I've never used the full-automatic features and don't miss them. I tend to use Aperture Priority, and set Exposure Compensation to underexpose by one-half f/stop. I also use the Histogram to look for potential problems (you can see the Histogram before shooting by switching to Live View mode, which you can do by pushing one button on the back of the camera).One feature I especially like is the ability to shoot at 8 frames per second. Great for birds in flight and butterflies. If you shoot only JPEG-format, an 8-GB CF card holds more than 1000 images. If you shoot RAW+JPEG you can store about 250 images on an 8-GB card. As I don't do sports photography, occasionally changing memory cards in the field is not a big problem, and if a card goes bad, I'll lose fewer images. I have two SanDisk cards and alternate them, and so far, no problems. I download images to my PC via the USB connection.I did have a problem with the camera, though it was my fault. The body is claimed to be water resistant, but that's not exactly right. I shot outside all summer here in South Florida, and a couple of times I dripped perspiration on the flash hot shoe. I _thought_ I wiped it off, but some must have gotten inside and corroded the hot-shoe terminals. The camera thought there was always an 'unidentified' external flash on board, so the internal flash wouldn't come on. And it wouldn't recognize my Canon 580EX II flash when I slid it into the hot shoe, though I still could use the flash. This problem cost me $450 to fix, but Canon had the camera back to me in less than two weeks, and their website kept me informed of its progress through the repair facility.Since I got the camera I launched a website devoted to the natural history of the county I live in, which means taking lots of photos of flowers, plants, trees and insects, as well as my favorites, birds. It's the nature of APS-C sensors to produce greater depth of field, which is overall a benefit when shooting close ups. Getting wide with an APS-C sensor means using an extreme lens, but the 10-22 mm EF-S (usable only on APS-C cameras) does the job. Never have I wished for a full-frame DSLR (only the $$$ to afford one!). If the market recovers I will probably buy a second 7D, so I don't have to change lenses when that neat bird flies over while I'm hunched down shooting a flower with the macro lens. I would definitely recommend the EOS 7D to any photographer with interests similar to mine. I studied the manual and purchased a copy of David Busch's book, which travels with me in the car. Take the time to learn the camera and don't be afraid to try different settings (keep notes so you know what you were doing when you review the photos).

The 7D is a huge step up from my 30D.  Here's what I like after a long weekend:The 100% 1x viewfinder is a nice change, once I stopped compensating as I did with my 30D.  Also, the overlay screens, like the grid, is helpful in keeping the horizons and verticals aligned without being obtrusive.Although there's been a few rumbles about the on/off switch being moved to the top left, once you get used to it, it is easier to use - I like it.  The lock for the quick control wheel is in approximately the same place.The 3\" LCD screen is big, bright and beautiful.  There's a big difference, even in brightness.  Less glare, too - noticeably less.  The 7D has a level function which lets you judge if your camera is leaning to one side or tilting forward or back.  Anyone who's peered over a bubble mounted on a hot shoe will appreciate this luxury.  And the LCD is bright enough to make this feature useful in daylight.Another nice feature is that the menu structure is changed.  There are more tabs, but all the menu items available on that tab are visible at once.  No more scrolling off the screen to get to \"format\" or other functions.The 7D lets you shoot 3 different sized RAWs in addition to the usual slew of JPEG sizes.  I like shooting the highest quality RAW + highest quality JPEG (so you get two files for each picture).  These files sizes are HUGE!  I found JPEGs to range from 4.73M to 11.1M and CR2 files range from 20.7M to 30.4M.  My 8G Sandisk Extreme IV held 237 shots (474 files).Rather than give you my subjective opinion on picture quality (I am totally satisfied with the quality of the photos), I point you to the best technical reviews of cameras that I know of - dpreview.  (Google it and you'll easily find it, I can't post the entire URL).  As of now they just have a preview of the 7D.

This phenomenon is not noticeable in an image with optimal exposure. The phenomenon may become more noticeable if a retouching process such as level compensation is applied to emphasize the image.\"  Keep your eyes open for a firmware update!Nov.

Coots \"VFXGeek\"", "ReviewID": "R8R18978Y7GZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On it's merits, it's a fantastic camera that is well covered in other reviews here. If you're trying to decide between this and the 5D Mark II, here's some thoughts to consider.The 7D is nearly identical to the 5D in terms of specs, in fact beats it in a few areas:- dual DIGIC processors on the 7D means 2X faster continuous shooting of 18MP RAW stills (the 7D shoots 8fps, just slightly behind the 10fps of their $5k cameras!)- the 7D has a much better, much improved auto-focus system vs. the 5D- when shooting video and monitoring on an HD monitor, the 7D works as expected, whereas the 5D drops the signal to standard definition when you hit record, so you're seeing the wrong size and aspect ratio while you film.In the end, the 5D's only real advantage is its full frame sensor, which will deliver slightly reduced noise, more narrow depth of field and, since there is no cropping, a 50mm lens is 50mm. Those are pretty much the three benefits of the 5D over the 7D. The depth of field issue is the one most often mentioned by those of us who use these cameras for shooting video, but consider this - a crop sensor is roughly 25x17mm, and motion picture film is 22x19mm. In essence, this means you're getting depth of field very similar to what audiences are used to seeing in feature films with the 7D.The 5D Mark II is almost $1,000 more, so you really have to ask yourself if that extra sensor size is worth it to you. To me, the 7D represents the absolute best balance of cost and performance on the market.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "7D for DSLR Beginners?", "Author": "New Dad", "ReviewID": "R161YJ4MRYNCNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not a technical review since there are tons of other existing reviews of those nature. This review is intended mostly for DSLR beginners or even better for those who own point and shoot (PS) and thinking about moving to the so called 'next' level. Before I share my two cents I would like to present an analogical question - what was your experience moving from one grade to the next in school? Not bad right? Eventually you understood what the books were trying to teach you. Well most of them! Same logic applies here.As compared to a PS camera there are of course more controls on Canon 7D but they are all understandable. More options means more control on the picture. You do not need to have 'years' of experience to master/understand this small instrument meant for capturing 'light'. All you need is two books - no one of them is not your camera manual. The only thing you need to understand from your camera manual is how to switch the camera to manual mode. Once you know this, throw your manual out of the window!The first book to read is David Busch's Canon EOS 7D Guide to Digital SLR Photography. Actually you do not need to read this book completely. The first three chapters are good enough to tell you what each button on the camera is meant for. You can read or more precisely refer to the remaining chapters depending on your need. Well some readers might object that you can get this info from your camera manual - that's true. However, if you are like me, you wont be able to stand that small book (camera manual) with monochromatic pictures and boring presentation. The choice is yours.The second book to read is Bryan Peterson's - Understanding Exposure. Read this end to end. It will make photography intuitive. After reading the very first chapter you will understand the core 'triangle' of photography which is comprised of the Aperture (the opening in the lens), ISO (light sensitivity) and shutter speed (the speed with which the shutter opens and closes). You will be surprised how your captured pics will have the correct exposure 'magically'. I guarantee you wont be disappointed after reading this book. Yes there is more to this book than capturing pics with correct exposure.Once you know how to manipulate your 7D, it will be your call how far you want to go with your compositions. As compared to entry level DSLRs, 7D offers more options. If you want to take nice pics and stay there you can choose one of the DSLRs from the rebel series. However if you want to have one DSLR with which you can learn DSLR photography and grow, 7D is the better choice. I particularly like the ability to access any function at the press of a button instead of digging deep in the menu. This translates into more overall speed and control over the camera and thus the pictures.So go ahead and get this fast beast without getting daunted!!3/9/12 Update:Lenses:I added 2 lenses to my collection: Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Prime and the Tamron AF 18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 Di II VC PZD LD Aspherical IF Macro Zoom Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras.I have found the Canon 50 mm prime to be the best for portrait photography and works great with the 7D. It can also be used as a general 'walk around lens' for landscape photography. It is lightweight and the max aperture of 1.8 works wonders - no exaggeration here. When purchasing this lens my decision was pretty clear.However, when I was looking for a zoom lens I had 3 choices: Canon 18-200 mm, Sigma 18-200 mm and Tamron 18-270 mm. After doing extensive research and seeing many pics taken by these lenses, I decided to go with Tamron. Another reason for going with Tamron was its jaw dropping 6 year warranty in the US. Nothing can beat this. Recently I took this lens on my trip to Nevada and found it to be great. You can google for the comparison of these 3 lenses and see the sample pics. You may also want to see the sample pics taken by Tamron on Amazon and decide for yourself.Tripod:If you are planning to buy a tripod, I would recommend the SLIK PRO 700DX Professional Tripod with Panhead (615-315). Its sturdy, comes with a carrying case and compliments 7D nicely.Camera Bag:I found the Case Logic SLR Camera/Laptop Backpack to be fantastic. The 7D fits into the bag with the 18-270 mm Tamron attached to it. It has many adjustable compartments and can fit 2-3 more lenses (not telephoto zoom) nicely.Please feel free to post questions if any. Hope this review was of some help.

As the title of the review says I just upgraded from a T3i after people told me, \"Don't do it! They have the same sensor.blah blah blah...\" Yes this is true and was one of the reasons that kept shying me away from pulling the trigger and getting this. Upon opening the box... WOW! I am soooo glad I am got rid of my T3i. Just the build of this camera alone can be seen as a good enough reason to upgrade by some. As soon as I charged the battery the first thing I did was to make sure I installed the newest firmware because it definitely helps with the performance. I really have to emphasize that if this is the camera you find yourself desiring, but do not have the cash to justify spending on this, just save and wait. I am really kicking myself in the butt for not just saving and buying this camera to begin with. Save and get what you want because as soon as you get the camera you can \"afford\" you are already thinking about ways to get your dream camera. This also allows you to build your lens collection.Low light / ISO settings:After doing my fair share of review reading, I came to realize something while I was playing with my new 7D. I never read a review where anyone mentioned the number of selectable ISO levels available. This may be common knowledge to a pro who has top of the line Canon body's, but for someone coming from an entry DSLR this would have been great to know. Also would have helped me convince myself I needed it :-P Let me give you an example:Canon 7D ISO levels: 100 125 160 200 250 320 400 500 640 800 1000 1250 1600 2000 2500 3200 4000 5000 6400 H(12800)Canon T3i ISO levels: 100 200 400 800 1600 3200 6400 H(12800)Now when people make the argument that I will have the same noise issue with both cameras, I agree and disagree. Yes, at the same ISO level there will be the same amount of noise. However, in a situation where the T3i has to use 3200 because 1600 is too dark, the 7D has two more ISO values between that. Personally, I believe this will help drastically with keep the most amount of noise out of your shot as possible. I have also come to notice that the large amount of ISO settings allows better Auto ISO.Saving Format:With my T3i I always shot in RAW format like 99% of the time. The 7D offers 3 different RAW formats, a small, medium, and large which can be helpful if you don't need to make a large print.View Finder / Auto-Focus:Compared to the T3i, the 7D blows it out of the water in both aspects. The 100% viewfinder and the very quick auto focusing system definitely make the 7D worth it. When I originally started to look at upgrading I always read about people talking about the bright 100% viewfinder, but I always thought, \"Could it really be that much better?\" I can honestly say there is a noticeable difference.Which lens to get??This questions took me a while to answer and figure out. I had to think to whether I seriously saw myself purchasing a full frame Canon in the distant future. If so, the EF lens would have probably been the best choice in lens. However, since I do not plan to go full frame (For now) then I personally believe the EF-S lens is the best choice. After a good amount of research, I chose to get the EF-S lens for many reasons. The EF lens came out in 1998, so its getting to be a pretty dated lens. On the other hand, the EF-S lens came out in 2009, so almost 10 years later. Some also believe that since the EF lens is USM that it will focus faster. Well when it came out, it definitely focused faster then the non USM lenses. However, the EF-S lens is just as fast if not faster. A friend of mine has the EF lens on his 60D and wishes he got the other one instead. Additionally, on my T3i I had the 18-55mm IS kit lens on it, and the build quality of that lens made me second guess getting the EF-S lens with my 7D. The EF-S 18-135mm lens has a completely different feel then my old kit lens. It's a very solid lens and I am glad I went with it. Also, at first it doesn't seem like the difference between the 28mm and 18mm is a lot, but it actually gives you even more versatility, especially with a crop sensor.WHAT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO:If you are upgrading from a pretty old camera the jump to the 7D will probably make a little more sense. However, if you are coming from a more recent dslr, upgrading may not seem to be the obvious choice. You have to ask yourself what your current camera can't do and the 7D can. Lastly, for everyone who thinks going from the t3i to the 7d was a poor choice because they can produce the same images, that is true, but the 7D offers much much more. The camera is just a tool. It doesn't determine how good of pictures you'll take, its you, and if the 7D brings out your inner creativity and confidence then get it!***The Rattle***That RATTLING noise the camera makes and your heart stops when you first hear it after pulling it out of the box. After putting the battery in my 7D and taking a few shots, I moved the camera to the side real fast and heard a rattle. At first, I thought 'O great they sent me a broken camera.' However, after looking through many forums this 'rattle' is part of the mechanism that pops the flash up. If you pop the flash up the rattle will go away.3/3/13 Update:Well I have now had my lovely 7D for quite some time. I am still extremely happy with my purchase! I am currently an enthusiast and I shoot for a local paper. This camera has not given me any problems since I have had it. The auto focus system of this dslr ROCKS! I now have the camera paired up with my 70-200 f2.8 L IS and it becomes a whole different monster. This camera is great for any type of sport photography. When you can capture at 8 fps you don't have to worry about capturing that perfect moment when you can capture the whole moment. lol This camera plus a Nifty-Fifty, Kit Lens, and a 70-200 L and you are ready for almost anything.After shooting many types of Nikons at work I am still glad I shoot Canon!3/25/13 Update:I just used the camera and my 70-200 f2.8 IS in the recent blizzard and when I was finished shooting outside my camera was covered in snow. When I brought it inside people were looking at me like I was crazy letting my camera get soaked. Needless to say I really put the weather sealing on my 7d and lens through a true test and I couldn't be happier because any non weather sealed camera would have been completely ruined.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "The 7D Truly is Designed for Extreme Environments", "Author": "R. Proulx \"Traveller\"", "ReviewID": "R3TJ6XPZV3IU2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just returned from a shoot in one of the most remote and inhospitable places in the world. It is called the Chaco Impenetrable and is located in the far north of Argentina. The climate there only knows two extremes. Either there is high humidity, rain, and mud, or it is bone dry with clouds of dust blowing almost constantly. Temperatures there often exceed 50 degrees Celsius. As it is summer now, I was either covered in dust or mud. I personally recorded a high temperature of 44 degrees Celsius. My major concerns were with the camera's weather sealing, its high temperature shooting capability, and the camera's nighttime auto focus capability.According to the camera's literature, extreme high temperatures can in principle slow the camera's operation or even shut the camera down if the temp gets too high. I never noticed even a slight degradation in the camera's performance even when shooting at high speed. This includes the day that the temperature reached 44 degrees Celsius at about 4PM.I shot in the rain, but not during the torrential downpours. I just couldn't bring myself to take such a chance. There seems to have been no penetration of water or humidity into the body. The view finder never once fogged over.More than the rain, I was worried about the dust clouds. When the rain ends, the sun's intense heat requires very little time to dry the ground. In short order the mud turns to dust. As always, I was quite careful to never change lenses when conditions were extreme. Instead, I shot principally with my 24 to 105L lens. Therefore, I was principally concerned with dust penetrating the camera's sealing. After I returned, I performed a very careful inspection of the camera and found zero penetration into the camera body. Every camera that I have ever owned, all Canons, including my old and venerable Canon New F1, allowed dust to enter the viewfinder. The 7D's dust sealing is nothing short of astounding.As there is no electricity there, nighttime shooting is wholly dependent either on flash or available moonlight. I traveled with minimal equipment in order to keep weight to a minimum. I left my 580 Speedlite at home and shot only with the onboard flash. During my time there, there was little to no available moonlight. I was therefore quite concerned about the camera's ability to focus at night.One night, I encountered an apasanka. An apasanka is a sort of tarantula except that it is about two to three times larger, runs almost as fast as a man, and can jump to attack. Its venom counts as one of the most fatal on the planet. I was able to run in an open area and get about five feet in front of it. We were head to head. As the situation occurred rather suddenly and the danger was great, my courage was adequate to only get one shot before discretion became the better part of valor and I jumped out of its way. I shot the photo in complete auto mode. The lens was able to achieve proper focus within less than two seconds and the flash light emitted exposed the shot perfectly. What a great photo.In my opinion, Canon's weather sealing claims are if anything, far too modest. I plan on an early winter shoot in Torres del Paine, in the far south of Chile, and am looking forward to testing its cold weather capability as well. The 7D is by far the best camera I have ever used in extreme environments.Update: After showing my photo to a friend who collects tarantulas, and also doing a little research myself, I would like to add/correct the following. \"Apasanka\" the word the local Criollo and Wichi in the Chaco Impenetrable use for this creature, is simply the generic Quechua/Quichua word for tarantula. This particular tarantula, which my friend once owned, is either called the Chaco Golden Knee Tarantula or Chaco Golden Striped Tarantula. Its scientific name is Grammastola Aureostriata. It is the largest of the known tarantulas here and can reach 8 inches in length. Although the locals informed me that its venom is incredibly dangerous, my friend informed me that its venom, although it can be fatal, rarely ever leads to death in humans. He affectionately referred to his former pet as \"muy amistosa,\" or `very friendly.'", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "An almost perfect camera", "Author": "Lloyd Tapper \"digitallloyd\"", "ReviewID": "RZWL9OTQ1308Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a month now after having the 30D for the past 3 years and using a 5DMk2 for a few months.  This camera is a perfect blend of the x0D series and xD series of cameras.  If it were a full frame camera, it would definitely be a pro grade camera.It is easy to use, the buttons are in the right places and you can customize most of the buttons to suit your working style.The 8 frames per second is amazing and the picture and video quality are top notch.The biggest concern on putting 18 megapixels in an APS-C sized sensor is noise, as has happened in the 50D camera.  However, rest assured that the new sensor provide great images up to ISO 800, some noise (which can be further reduced in post-production) up to 1600, then above 1600 you have to be careful about quality loss.They have only continued 2 features that I find annoying in their cameras:  1) the location of the depth-of-field preview button at the base of the lens is hard to reach since my hand is generally holding the lens, not the base of the camera, and  2) the 6 second timeout on seeing the displayed information inside the viewfinder after you press a button.  I wish it were longer.A third thing I could add is for auto-focus during video shooting.The bottom line is that Canon has produced a camera which is a joy to shoot with.  It feels great in the hand, the features are rich, and the interface is clean (especially when you configure the 'My Menu' to show the 5 most important menu items that you regularly use).

I used the XSi for about 10 months. Was it worth it? YES! It's because I USE/EXPLOIT the following features of the 7D not found on the XSi.AF System - I shoot some sports, birds-in-flight, and other moving targets and the AF performance of the 7D is AMAZING. It is FAST and ACCURATE. Not only can you select the AF point MUCH faster than the XSi, it has more modes too. AF-point expansion and Zone AF are my favorites. I find Spot AF to be really accurate especially in low light. No one should be using the full 19-pt auto-select AF if they are using this level of camera (in my opinion). 8FPS is blazin' fast!High-ISO - Ok, it's not a full frame but I can use ISO2500 with confidence. Luminance noise responds very well to noise reduction (In Lightroom 3, beta 2). I cringe at the ISO1600 output on the XSi.Handling - Having two control dials, a top LCD, and a directional \"joystick\" makes shooting so much easier than having just one dial on the XSi. Button layout is very intuitive.Viewfinder - Some say that the 100% viewfinder on the 7D is overrated. I don't think so. Just look through it and notice that it is much bigger and brighter than the XSi's. Your eye will scream for joy! OK, a bit exaggerated but you get my idea ;)Build Quality - Not a biggie especially if you don't expose your camera to harmful elements. However, I have to say that the bigger and heavier 7D is a bit more stable and easier to hold (bigger grip) than the small, plasticky XSi (get a battery grip, problem solved).18MP sensor - Whenever I crop a picture, I crop it hardcore. Having a bajillion pixels saves SO MUCH detail during the process. 25MB RAW files can fill up your hard drive fast.Other - you also get video capabilities (nice bonus), high-res LCD (sweet), electronic level finder (very useful on hand-held symmetrical shots). Also, the built-in wireless flash trigger works seamlessly with my 430EX II (now you're ready to do some real strobist stuff)If you don't plan on using these features, I'd say save your money and get better lens. Maybe get a T2i and have slightly better image quality but pretty much the same in all other aspects. Stay away from the 50D, not that it's a bad camera but rumors say that a 60D might come out soon. Note that I use high-quality lenses (EF-S 17-55 f/2.8 IS USM, and EF 70-200 f/4 L USM) and the 7D's jam-packed sensor can make the most out of them.Just my 2 cents. Hope this helps.Sir Adam", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "7D is better than most people seem to want to believe it is", "Author": "M. Heltsley", "ReviewID": "R1LOKWX7WRE2YT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a budding professional photographer with a fairly short track record with different bodies.  I have owned a Canon rebel, a hand full of film bodies from Olympus, Pentax, Yashica, Canon, misc holga, etc, and misc video cameras.  I have shot with 40D and 50D bodies with various lenses often, 5DmI and 5DmII often enough to know I did not want one yet.  And I was seriously contemplating jumping ship to Nikon or Sony and replacing all my glass with new stuff.  Then the 7D came along.  It was the perfect solution for me.  I will pit it against the best from Nikon or Sony, and be more than happy with the results.I get amazing low light images, especially since I shoot a lot of f/1.4 prime glass (and f/2.8 zooms when needed).  The ISO is managable at H (12800) in lightroom 3 or with Noise Ninja or Noiseware or Nik Dfine.  I have used them all and each does a great job, LR3 being my favorite.  I can make stunning 16x20 and larger prints from an ISO 12800 image with little or no degradation.  People who say otherwise are pixel peepers who need to be realistic.  My friends who shoot D700's can't even do that.  At that size their 12MP images start to break down even if they had marginally better noise handling to start with.  And it is marginal.  We have compared side by side in print and on screen images from ISO 100 through 12800 from the 7D and D700 and D300s (and the 5DmI up to 1600) and the 5DmII and the 7D, in my opinion, handily beats or matches them.  Especially with the awesome NR in LR3.  Phenomenal.  The 5DmII files do look better at high ISO sometimes, and it goes a stop higher, but really up to ISO 6400 it is hard to tell them apart.  The D700 starts in with the noise a little later, maybe 2/3rd of a stop later (ISO 400 instead of 250 on the 7D), but once in the noise is not worse on the 7D at any level until 12800 at which point the D700 might be a little cleaner on the noise pattern and size and can go to 25600 (which is pretty bad).  Though again with good NR it can easily be wiped out.I can hit 8FPS, some others can't because they don't read the manual, but if you do, and if you understand WHY it is slowing down, you can easily get 8fps.  I have tested it on 300x CF cards and can get about 145 large fine jpgs before the buffer fills and it hiccups.  I can easily get more than 20 raw, a good 3 seconds of shooting, before the buffer fills.  a 600x card would be even better as the 7D is one of the only bodies out there that can make use of that speed (none of the Nikon or Sony line can, nor does the 5DmI or II).The AF is amazing.  That is the reason I did not go to the 5D I or II.  Their AF was lousy.  I have a little kid who I chase with this thing all the time, I need great AF.  That was the other main reason I wanted a Nikon, besides the high ISO.  I am glad to say that with 19 cross type AF points and the new logic and dual procs I can follow her with AI servo and never get an out of focus shot on almost any of my lenses.  That said some lenses are better than others and you have to understand your gear, but for knowing which lenses work and which don't makes all the difference.  I find that the 18-200 is not fast enough many times, especially in its mid to tele range.  The 17-55 is always fast, the 70-200 is awesome quick.  Even in low light it is good.  Not as good as if it had a AF assist light, but a simple AF assist from a flash or a little video light, etc and there are no problems.  Honestly in most of my venues I shoot at around ISO 3200 (sometimes more sometimes less) and yet the AF rarely hunts long.  I use single focus points usually, only going to zone when it suits the scene, and I find that I get lock quickly nearly every time, and this is mostly in the dark.  In daylight its so good as to be scary.  From the 5D or the 50D it is noticeably faster and more accurate.  From a rebel its night and day.The commander mode (master flash) is super handy if IR flash is your thing.  I love it, but its not quite as fleshed out as Nikon.  The fact that it is finally here though, thats huge.  The fact that in a controlled space I can control all the other flashes with it, well that is awesome.  But I have radiopoppers for that.  So i rarely use it.  But it still comes in handy.  It is really handy to be able to take the flash physically off the camera, hold it in your other hand, and use the commander mode to fire it without having to put on triggers.  How cool.Finally I would like to sum up that if you like a crop sensor this is hands down the best one yet.  The dual digic IV procs make it fast and competent.  The commander mode gives it a leg up on even the 1D family as no other Canon can do it.  The 8fps and 19 point AF that works well in the dark will piss off all the 5D (1&2) owners and the image quality and resolution are above any of the competition.  The view finder is big and bright.  Even D700 and 5D users comment on how big and bright this is, and it has better coverage too at 100% than any of those FF finders.  Plus 1080 24fps video.  Don't even get me started.  Until a month or so ago even the 5dm2 did not do that.  Videographers use the 7D, along with the 5DmII, in lieu of more expensive and less capable video cameras.  Just add a great mic and learn to steady it for longer than a single frame and you are now shooting some of the best HD video available.  Better than your local TV station in most cases.  Phenomenal.This is just a killer camera.  The only people who would hate it are non Canon folks, of which I was almost one until this came along, full frame fanatics and those who get a bad copy.  Anyone who gets one that does not focus, etc needs to send it back.  It happens.  I got lucky but I would not settle for luck, if you get a bad one replace it.

Clark", "ReviewID": "R9UM045QHB6TW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shooting for a couple of years with the Rebel XSI. I purchased some nice lenses (50mm 1.4, 70-200 L IS 2.8) and was getting good results, but sometimes missed on great shots because of poor focus. I was saving up for the Canon 5d Mk2 when this camera came out. I went to the local camera shop and tried it side by side with the 5d Mk 2 with my own lenses and was sold on it immediately. The speed and accuracy of focus combined with the high frame rate were great, but more than that, the camera just was so responsive in every aspect. I would compare it to driving a sports car after driving the family minivan. All DSLRs are quick, but this camera was amazingly fast with low light, high ISO situations, locking on focus and taking the picture noticeably faster than the 5d.The one major concern I had was image quality. There were some negative reviews online, and I know the full frame cameras are the best at high ISO, low-light situations. After shooting more than 3,000 photos and 2 dozen videos over two months, however, I can tell you the image quality is spectacular for both photos and HD video. Not every photo is a masterpiece, but the \"hit\" rate of perfect focus and exposure is easily 3-4 times as high as for the Rebel XSI. The only trouble is, with the high frame rate, sorting through all of the photos to decide which one captures the moment the best. Considering this camera is almost $1000 less than the Canon 5d Mk 2, it is hard to imagine better performance.There are two negative to consider, mainly for the high-end consumer. First, the camera is significantly heavier than the entry level Rebel. Second, there are no \"Scene\" modes, like portrait or sports. This camera is more advanced and you need to have a pretty good idea of how to change aperture, shutter speed, and ISO to get good pictures. If you leave your current camera on the auto setting or scene settings most of the time, or you are trying to upgrade from a point-and-shoot to a DSLR, you will not be able to utilize this camera to its full potential without a significant amount of time invested in learning about photography.One final tip - I was able to record video and high frame rate photos using a 133x compact flash card without any problems.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect camera", "Author": "Helen", "ReviewID": "RC80ZRZF5NCWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alright, so I'm not going to go into great detail to why I love this camera. I'll keep it true and short.My previous camera was the Canon XTi, I loved (and still do love) that camera. As soon as I turned on the LCD to my 7D I was in shock! It's so  clear, and the colors from it are incredible. The 7D's LCD is beautiful! <3 It's also built like a tank. I feel secure when little kids ask me if they can take a picture with it now! XD I just tell them to make sure the wear the strap. ;) lol Battery life is WAY better. The 8 FPS is really useful. More useful than I had originally thought. (I do a lot of sports.) Video is great! The built in speaker is...okay, buy the Rode directional mic ($150 bucks,i think) If you'll be doing a lot of video, like me. Okay so now the ISO. It's better than the XTi that's for sure. But, one thing you should know about the this camera is it has a noise reduction feature built into the camera. So It's really not a problem. I take photos in ISO 1000-1600 regularly. You don't really notice the noise until you blowup the image to about 150% It's really not a problem. Just make sure you have the High ISO noise reduction feature enabled. And really, if the picture that you took is that bad that all you notice is the noise, you should really should try to hone your photography skills before buying this camera. The only thing I don't like about the camera is the 18mp. It's really too much on a little 1.6 crop factor camera. 10.mp is perfect for a DSLR. But that's really it. I will never print a picture that big. The biggest I've ever gotten is 8X10. And that's still kinda small.Okay, that's my review.

All of that info is out there if you need it to help you. My opinion is that there are folks wanting to make this type of purchase who may have the same kind of knowledge and experience as I have had. I hope this helps...From 1973 to 1995 I used a canon TLQL35mm and shot thousands of frames.  1979 till 1999, I shot weddings.(235).  Cameras were Pentax 6X7, and Mamiya 645. My clients and I were always pleased with the results from my work. Stopped doing weddings, sold the equipment, and put photography down for a good while. 2006, purchased A100. Shot 23,000 frames until putting that camera down last month. The A100 always left me wanting more. I wanted the clarity from the old days of medium format. I wanted clear bright viewfinders where my old (middle age) eyes could clearly see to focus. I have many many fine images. Photographing everything from ants to Eagles on 19 acres of farm land. (I print 8 1/2 by 11's on canon Pixma 6600 printer) The camera did serve me well. But.....I always knew there was more. Not being top quality glass for lenses held my images back. Very often I was disappointed. They looked fine and all, and friends would be amazed. None the less I knew there was more. I labored over getting new glass for the A100, but ultimately decided to go back to Canon.  So, enough background.  I purchased the 7D one month ago with the 17 - 40 F4 L USM series, and 70- 200 F4 L USM series lenses. Both without IS, because of dramatic price difference. Much Much less cost. I can live with F4, and I can hold the camera still with mono or tripod. 1400 frames so far. When I began to see what this 7D had to offer I was amazed. Crystal clear viewfinder. Sharp focus. This camera and choice of lenses are precisely what I was missing. The speed of focus is tremendous. Pelicans in flight where you can count feathers, and see the color in their eyes.Lightning shots with stars visible above the thunder head. In the last month I have been absolutely stunned by the images from this fine camera. Ordered kit with 23-135 lens because that was the only way I could buy it from Amazon. (I don't like buying from third parties) Sold the kits lens to a friend who has T2I. Never used it or even put it on 7D. Purchased non canon brand battery grip, and have ordered wireless flash remotes also non Canon brand. Using 8 gig Ultra cf cards.  (I don't want to have too many images on one card in case card ever had a failure) Shooting in RAW and JPEG, and save raw images as 'hi res\" jpegs to print. I use the camera in manual, and usually like the exposures one mark \"under\". First shots in manual were two hours after opening box.  Now, I fully realize that full frame is far superior and that may be the rest of getting images that compare to the clarity and detail of the old days of medium format.BUT....that will have to wait at least for me.SO....If you have had  similar experiences, and hesitation  all I can say is... don't be afraid. You will be absolutely pleased. This camera WITH great quality L series glass will amaze those of us who want to make the step from entry lever digital slr's. To top off my praise for this camera, I had a technical question and called Canon. I spoke with an awesome customer service rep with no delay, and they followed up with a quick email survey to make sure I was happy. I am to say the least... very very pleased with this purchase.

Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-inch LCD and 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "APS-C Wonder Child", "Author": "P.K. Frary \"Gochugogi\"", "ReviewID": "R19Y1RVUUTVRET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPS delivered a new 7D on October 8, 2009, five weeks after I placed an Amazon pre-order. During the last 4.5 years I've gotten to know this groundbreaking DSLR well. With weather seals at the level of the legendary EOS 1N, high performance appointments and contoured magnesium body shell, the 7D is like a mini 1D. It's solid yet comfy in hand: deep finger grooves in the grip and thick textured rubber make for a secure handhold. The large thumb rest anchors the thumb and increases grip security.The shutter is softer than a 50D but louder than my 60D and 6D. If you're a SLR shooter you'll consider the 7D pianissimo. At 8FPS I call it fast. To maintain high FPS you need a good battery and the 7D is good for 1000 images per charge. Obviously video and live view reduce battery time. The LP-E3 batteries are dependable and have a useable life of about 3 years.CONTROL INTERFACE: Controls revolve around 3 wheels, 19 buttons, 1 joystick and 11 tabbed menus. Major features rely on physical controls can be set by feel while looking through the viewfinder. Menus ares used for options. Wheels have stiff resistance, making accidental turning unlikely. EOS veterans whould feel at home and will barely need to crack the manual. Most controls can be reprogrammed. I configured the joystick for direct selection of AF points and assigned center AF point to the DOF button. Menus can be configured too, e.g., group favorite settings under a single tab. The menus are well organized with options on a single page.VIEWFINDER: The viewfinder shows 100% of the image at 1.0X magnification and is the best APS-C viewfinder I've used. The focusing screen is not user replaceable but the transmissive LCD display--transparent LCD over the focusing screen--can simulate five AF patterns, grid and plain matte screens. The red AF display flashes may be changed to dark gray or disabled. The viewfinder data display is bright and easy to read.AUTOFOCUS: The 19-point cross-type AF array is the most significant 7D innovation. The center point is a double cross. Imagine two superimposed crosses: rotate one cross so the arms fall in between the axis of the other. A F2.8 or faster lens is needed to enable high precision double cross sensitivity. With slower optics it reverts to normal precision and single cross.  Off-center points are cross point and can snag almost anything. Although the 7D has double the AF points of the 50D, the AF area is the same size. AF selection via joystick is precise and quick.My disappointment with 19-point auto select is active points can't be directly overridden with the joystick. Instead, press the AF selection button, use the M-Fn button to cycle through modes until single point AF appears and, finally, select the AF point with the joystick! Oddly, individual AF points may be chosen in 19-point AI servo. However, the selected point is a starting point for AI servo tracking: focus is handed off to each of the 19 points as the subject is tracked across the frame.My compromise for the problem above is to use Zone AF with center point assigned to the DOF button. Zone AF behaves like 19-point AF, but limited to one of 5 user selected zones. Zones may be chosen directly via joystick and, if pin point accuracy is needed or it misses, press the DOF button to narrow AF to a single point within the active zone. Essentially it becomes 5-point AF with the DOF button. Release DOF button to return to normal operation.Spot AF reduces AF point size for precise control of the focal point, ideal for macro and portraits. Why not use normal Single point AF? Normal AF points are large and may cover both the eye and eyebrow in a tight portrait, locking on the more contrasty eyebrow. Reducing AF point size insures an eyeball lock. Spot AF is the most significant focusing breakthrough of the past 5 or 6 years. It's not for everyone, but makes macro and portrait shooters happy.METERING: Sixty-three zone metering debuted in the EOS 1D Mark III and filtered down to the 7D. Evaluative metering integrates color data into the algorithm and is better at avoiding overexposure of reds. It's a minor improvement over 35-zone metering of XXD cameras but better in tricky lighting. Exposure compensation (EC) is adjustable to +/- 3 stops. Metering is more biased to the active AF point than earlier EOS DSLRs, i.e., the object you focus on has more weight in exposure calculations. In Zone AF where a group of AF points lock, the exposure is more averaged.FLASH: The retractable E-TTL flash is great for fill flash and snapshots. AF assist is the main gotcha--pulses like a disco strobe--but can be disabled. The popup also functions as a wireless E-TTL flash master, using light pulses to trigger compatible Speedlites. If you use auto-ISO with flash, it defaults to ISO 400. Often that is not high enough for balanced fill in low light, and too high for fill in bright light, so you'll need to dial in ISO settings manually.Flash exposure compensation (FEC) in -3 to + 3 in 1/2 or 1/3 stop increments, FE Lock (M-Fn button) and second curtain sync are available in the flash menu. Flash exposure is normally accurate and I rarely need FEC, save for very dark or light subjects. FEC has a dedicated button and can be set without taking your eye from the viewfinder.IMAGE QUALITY: At low ISO there isn't much improvement over 50D RAW files. That's not a bad thing as the 50D is excellent at ISO 100-400. However, 7D high ISO shows significant improvement over its predecessor with reduced noise, especially banding. The 7D pulls off a great ISO 800 and a good 1600. With default DPP noise reduction files are fine for nice 11 x 17 or 13 x 19 inch prints. In a pinch I wouldn't hesitate to use ISO 3200 with noise reduction.APS-C cameras are less tolerant of underexposure than full frame models. I shoot RAW, \"expose to the right\" and pull back exposure 1/2 stop or so prior to converting to TIFF. The resulting image is cleaner than normally exposed ones. Avoid AutoISO and select settings with less noise: ISO 160, 320, 640 and 1250, rather than 200, 400, 800 and 1600.FINAL BURB: The 7D is a nimble, precise and capable instrument, and a significant upgrade over the 50D. Durable construction and top AF performance make it great for outdoor action. However, the 7D is not for everybody: heavy and the plexus of features insure a long learning curve. I've owned it over four years and it still delivers in spades.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "My second baby: Photographers view", "Author": "KHRHEE91", "ReviewID": "R7FRCOTFVCNFI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not that I have a first actual baby, but it is my second 7D body and it doesn't fail to deliver.Many directors and such use the 7D for video recording and it is a great camera for it. But as my area is only really in photography, my review will be regarding it and practical information.The first things you notice through the viewfinder is the incredible 19 point AF point systems. It allows for much better focusing as well as accurate focusing. Secondly, the metering and focus allows the 7D to focus on objects must faster. The viewfinder also looks a lot larger than the lower end cameras such as the 100's or the 10's.The other surprising factor is the amazing frames per second that you get. It's faster than any other canon camera out and is a true beast when taking pictures of sports games.The ISO gets up to 6400 but ISO 1600 still gives you amazing photographs.Shutter is a very important part of shooting and although I won't get near the so called shutter amount it can handle; the shutter feels very good. It doesn't feel plasticky and gives you a little bit of resistance that feels amazing, you have to try one yourself.Live mode is great to use, the lcd if you can see it doesn't matter much which angle you see it from.One thing that I thought was a \"cool\" feature that I didn't think of using much was the digital meter. But after a few photoshoots where a tripod wasn't accessible or impractical, the digital level was a lifesaver! A bubble meter sometimes isn't that great when it comes to anything besides vertical and horizontal being aligned but the camera gives you a great cockpit type view.Design wise everything is great to handle and feels sturdy. I have sea water splash on the camera a few times and it still goes strong, the weather durable body can take it's fair share of damage. The only one pet peeve is that of the power button. Having it on the left side doesn't help a lot with fast on's, but you get used to sliding your left hand back from the lens and switching the power button with your left thumb. The 8 directional bad reacts well and the toggle as well.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Pro-AM camear", "Author": "oddley", "ReviewID": "R3D5R1W5WL28OT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Canon cameras for almost 20 years.  I started with the AE-1 and have owned 4 additional Canon cameras since then.  My current camera is a Canon XSi which is a great camera and I have not had any issues with it at all, but I wanted something a little faster and something that could manage low light situations without needing to resort to a flash.I researched cameras extensively before purchasing the 7D.  I looked at the T3i, T2i, 60D, 7D, and 5D Mark II.  In the end, it was the wealth of features available on the 7D that won me over.The T2i, T3i, and 60D are excellent cameras and anyone choosing them will be quite happy - they can take excellent photos, have enough raw pixel size to allow for significant cropping/enlargements, and can even shoot full HD video if you desire.  If you are a starting photographer and want a great camera to 'get your feet wet' there aren't any better choices that those cameras.  For me, however, I knew I wanted something bigger, more powerful, and with more features.That really brought me to the 7D or the 5D Mark II.  Both are excellent cameras for the Pro-AM or Semi-Pro photographer.  In fact, both would even work for full-on professional photographers without any issues.  The primary difference between the two (at least in my decision making process) was the full-frame sensor in the 5D Vs. the crop factor sensor in the 7D.  Trying to look up the differences between these sensors will drag you, kicking and screaming, into a bitter argument and BOTH sides swear they are right.  Crop factor is better because of the added 'zoom'.  Full frame is better because it has less pixel density and therefore less ISO corruption.  The list goes on and on and on and, really, doesn't end up meaning much.  The crop factor sensor in this camera is lightyears ahead of a full-frame sensor found in Canon cameras that are even just 5 years old.  You can get EXCELLENT photos from either sensor.  You can get acceptable low-light behavior from either sensor.  You can have photos from either camera published.  The differences really come down to what kind of photography you find yourself doing most often.  If you spend a lot of time shooting tight spaces, close-up portraits, and super-fine detail work, a 5D may be the better choice (although you can easily overcome the limitations on the 7D crop factor sensor with a lens purchase or two).  If you shoot action, outdoors, zoom photography, the 7D is a better choice.The 7D is a dream for me.  The 8FPS shooting makes it so much easier to capture wildlife or motorsports shots that I just couldn't get before.  The auto-focus is INCREDIBLY fast and sharp....  I've been shooting cars at an automotive drifting event where the cars are sliding sideways towards me at 90mph and all 15 or 20 rapid-fire shots I took were perfectly sharp and in focus.  With the $1000 I saved over the 5D, I purchased some fantastic L glass which simply fit perfectly with this system.The versatility of the 7D is still impressing me.  I can go from shooting a motorsports event to shooting an indoor birthday party and everything is crisp, clear, and exposed just right.  If I want to get 'artistic' it is easy to flip a few switches and alter aperture or shutter settings.

The large buffer and fast write speeds make for really large bursts of shots. I shoot wildlife almost exclusively and use RAW + JPG settings so the demand on the buffer is intense. When an eagle launches off of a perch to attack the water and grab a fish, you don't want a full buffer causing you to miss the shot. Furthermore the two processors really helps the system. For the first time I find that AI Auto-focus actually works well. The XSi had AI Auto-focus, but it did not seem to be able to keep up very well. And while we are talking about it, the 7D's Auto-focus is exceptional in any mode. All in all, I am loving the upgrade and it was worth every penny. The 7D also is a larger body camera that fits my hand much better than the XSi did. It also has a much larger and brighter viewfinder as it is a penta-prism, not a penta-mirror like on the XSi. While the 7D is a bit heavier, it balances better with my EF 100-400mm L lens and is still usable hand-held for hours on end. Does it sound like I am totally happy?

I have to say this is a revolutionary improvement from the early model DSLRs.  Not that I had any problems with my 10D.  It has served me well for the better part of a decade and has traveled with me on four continents.  But the features and performance of this camera are simply superb.  I won't bore with a full review of all features, as those have already been well covered here and on the many photography review sites.  Some key improvements though from the earlier models:100% viewfinder - definitely cut down on postprocessing with the full viewLiveView - finally, can shoot from awkward angles without having to just guessVideo - Haven't used extensively, but like what I'm seeing so farMenu System - Very easy to navigate and the My Menu feature is very nice for combining those features you use the mostBurst - No worries about missing a shot.  Go large jpeg and you can shoot almost indefinitely (or until your card runs out)Picture Quality - Um, wow.  With this sensor, you can get some really nice cropsAbout the only (mild) annoyance is the introduction of a new battery pack.  Canon switched to the same higher-cap battery as the 5D Mark II.  Form factor very close to the 511 battery used on all prior xxD cameras.  Would have been nice if the old batteries were compatible, with the caveat that they wouldn't last as long.

Since then, it's been the workhorse for our staff. Going through the metadata of our pictures, almost all the great images we've gotten throughout the years have been taken with this camera.PROS:Fantastic build quality. The magnesium alloy build is worth the purchase alone. Many sporting events take place regardless of weather conditions (lacrosse, soccer, etc.) which means we need a body that can withstand the elements. The 7D has gone through rainstorms, mud, and snow without fail. The small dings and scratches the body has received over the years have yet to impact its performance and weather sealing.The focusing system is probably the best I've used outside of the new Canon 5D Mark III/ 1 DX. It's ability to focus quickly from subject to subject has allowed myself and my other photogs to get some really amazing shots. As long as you have good lighting, it's basically a professional level camera in terms of focusing. Also, the chain drive, 8 frames per second, is great for action. Unbelievable speed that has captured some fantastic moments.The viewfinder. Being 100% coverage, it is simply awesome. It's bright and big, which allows me to compose my shots accurately and correctly. In the field, this makes all the difference, as sometimes, we only have 5-10min to get our shots in. Being able to compose the shot without thinking about the extra 3% the viewfinder isn't picking up is fantastic. Since using the 7D viewfinder, I find it hard to use other cameras that don't have viewfinders of the same quality.Of course the most important thing is the image quality which is also amazing. Great detail and fantastic color reproduction. Despite its age, it still competes quite well with the best APS-C cameras out there. Great value.CONS:Probably the biggest sign of the 7D's age, the ISO performance leaves much to be desired. Shooting basketball games, for example, is tough as I'd prefer another stop of ISO to get a better picture. I limit myself and my photogs to ISO 3200 for this camera, and even then that's pushing it. In JPEG format, the noise isn't that noticeable. However, if you tend to shoot in RAW a lot, then things could get messy, especially if you do a lot of work in post.The camera takes CF cards, which isn't a bad thing. However, when you look at the super cheap price of 16Gb and 32Gb SD Cards these days, it's hard to look past the CF slot. Moreover, most laptops and computers are shipping with SD card slots these days, making image transfers very easy. For our newsroom, having an SD card slot would probably save a good 5-10min on file transfers alone, especially in the field. It's not a deal breaker, but something that would make our life a little easier.OVERALL:Still the best camera I've used. Not only is it reliable, but it consistently takes amazing pictures for all of our staff. Moreover, it is available now for a very good price. I'm looking to add one or two more for our staff, despite it being so \"old.\" Ours has taken a beating and still works like it is brand new. Pair it up with some great glass (we have a 300mm f2.8 L for example) and the pictures will blow you away.

It is not a 50D. It is a near-perfect compromise between the two.In the 7D is a combination of resolution (18MP) and speed (8fps) which makes it an extremely versatile camera. Canon improved the high ISO performance, providing a 1 to 1.5 stop improvement. So, ISO 3200 looks like 1600. And with the ISO 6400 and 12800 you can see in the dark. However, ISO 12800 should only be used in dire emergencies. The 18MP allows for more aggressive cropping and more detailed prints at the larger sizes. The per-pixel detail is also excellent.The new AF system is both versatile, sophisticated, fast, and accurate (even at f1.4). I recommend dedicating some time to the manual and practicing with its many features because there is a little learning curve to extract the potential of the new AF. Added bonus with the new system are: ability to use any point for AI Servo, prioritizing focus over speed or visa versa, and AF point expansion.The 100% viewfinder is great and bright, enabling true WYSWYG composition and improved manual focusing. A grid, AF points, and other information can be toggled on and off to help with composition and alignment.A totally new and LONG OVERDUE feature is the ability to use the pop-up flash to control remote flashes. It works very well, especially indoors, triggering your remotes. Only situations I would resort to my 580EX II for triggering is if I'm outside in bright sun, flashes are at odd angles, or the flashes are far away. Aside from the those situations, the pop-up flash as a trigger works very well.It looks like Canon did a great job listening to its photographers and trends in photojournalism.

The controls are all intuitive, I can get to every setting I can imagine in very short order, the body fits my hand perfectly; it has to be the fastest camera I have ever seen.My previous most passionate camera love was a Canon EOS 10s. When 3 Megapixel cameras were finally somewhat perfected and cost over a thousand dollars, I gave up my 10s and a major batch of lenses, flashes, Minolta IV flash meter, and a ton of accessories for an Olympus smart media all in one camera. I loved digital, and put up with the camera (or learned how to work around its limitations). Then I progressed to a Canon S50, a Canon Powershot Pro1, and finally a Canon XTi. Image quality increased with each purchase, and there were fewer and fewer compromises. When I finally picked up this 7D, I fell in love. No it wasn't love at first sight; it took bolting this camera to a 300mm f2.8 beast and working a football game that sealed my love.Finally a digital camera that works and feels a lot like the original best of the class 35mm film cameras. I guess the EOS 1 series has always done that, but that camera has always been way out of my price range. I have large hands, and the 7D fits perfectly in my hand. Every single button is exactly where I need it. Make no mistake; this is a very large camera. It is probably a good 25% larger than an XTi / XSi / T1i. It is a little bit heavier than those cameras, but not a huge amount.On a purely still photography level, I can't imagine a more perfect camera. If you do any sports photography and are on the fence over this camera and the T1i, stop thinking and just buy this 7D. The high speed frame capture is incredible. I've photographed my son playing football for six years; he's now a sophomore playing football at college. I was pretty good at anticipating the best moment to take the picture (even with that PowerShot Pro1 I got some darn good pictures). But bolting on 8 frames per second, peak action is a given every play (the down side, editing after the game, there are hundreds and hundreds of pictures to delete).I've recently learned that the best way to photograph football, or most fast action sports, is to use manual exposure settings (it makes sense, the lighting doesn't change much). This camera has a very easy to read gauge at the bottom of the viewfinder that indicates +/- EV to what the meter would have set. This feature is absolutely indispensible for manual settings - no silly flashing, just a nice analog meter at the bottom.This camera focuses faster than anything I have ever seen. There seems to be focus rectangles all over the screen. Whenever focus is achieved, even in servo (or follow focus) mode, the rectangle flashes black in daylight, and red in low light. The servo seems to track a focused object better than I've seen in previous cameras.If you have a Canon 580EX II flash, this thing controls that flash perfectly. There's no need for that stinking sixty dollar off camera cord. There are more modes to control the flash than I could ever imagine using off camera: include the on camera flash, don't include the on camera flash, set ratios between the two flashes, add A and B flashes, control the ratios of all the flashes. The settings are somewhat buried in a menu, but once set, they do exactly what you need. Placing a 580 in a softbox or an umbrella is a piece of cake - zero cabling. I love this function.The kit lens is surprisingly good. This is not the same piece of junk that Canon packages with the Rebel Digital line. The lens is hefty. The front element does not rotate during zoom or focus, a huge bonus. To me the jury is still out on Image Stabilizing (IS) for this lens. I wasn't very impressed with how it worked for football photography. Sadly, I'm comparing it to a four thousand dollar lens, and that isn't fair at all.My one single complaint with this camera is the viewfinder. I wear glasses and it is has taken a bit of getting used to aligning myself to the viewfinder. There isn't quite as much eye relief as I'd like. It is a minor adjustment I'm making. I was also struck by how the viewfinder isn't as bright as on other cameras. Nothing terribly or disturbing, just about one stop dimmer than other cameras I've used. On the other hand, the vertical and horizontal grids are fantastic - no more rotating all my pictures 2 degrees because I tilt the camera that direction.But WAIT THERE's MORE! The video on this camera is everything in the world you have read about. I have totally died and gone to heaven over that mode. I love film and movies more than anyone. I've dreamt about making my own films, and have been so frustrated with video cameras. I never realized it was depth of field that ruins video cameras, or gives them away. You've seen the sample films professionals have shot with the 5D Mark II, they are very film like. Well the 7D shoots exactly the same kind of film (um video).Now there are a few gotchas with the video. This isn't a camcorder, so grabbing it, hoping for autofocus and crazy zoom with buttons, isn't going to happen. You really have to think before you press the stop start button. Live view takes a very long time to achieve focus (you have to do that before filming). Any focusing you do during shooting has to be done manually, so you better know your distances because you cannot set focus from the live view screen. Zoom is mostly out of the question because the zoom ring is simply not smooth enough on the kit lens to get a fluid zoom. In order to follow focus and zoom, you will have to buy some very expensive motors to attach to this camera (that is what the professionals have done to make all those videos you've seen). On the other hand, if you plan the shot carefully, avoid zooming and changes in focus plane - this is the most incredible video camera every built. The first day I owned this camera, I stepped outside, focused on a waving American flag, and started recording. This was the most beautiful piece of 15 second video I had ever captured. The flag is in perfect focus right at the pole with beautifully blurred trees in the background.Sound for video is also a bit complicated. The built in microphone captures MONO sound only. It is not a bad microphone, but be prepared for a ton of wind noise if there is even a breeze. Frankly, there is no other way to capture sound than to use an external recording device with microphones, or buy attachment microphones that sit on the hot shoe. But even with external microphones, the camera still does dynamic level setting (no way to over ride that setting) and can create some very bad recording levels.On the video front, if you want to recreate those gorgeous videos you've seen on Vimeo, you'll need two very expensive motor drives for zoom and focus, a really great fluid head tripod, and an external audio recording device. The video captured is nothing short of incredible.Is the 5D Mark II worth the extra money? I think the fundamental difference is full frame 35mm on the 5D versus APS-C sensor on the 7D. For my money, I think you hit diminishing marginal returns on the 5D, I'd rather spend the extra money on lenses or flashes. I have not touched a 60D yet. The reviews have been excellent. I think there are a few compromises compared to the 7D that I didn't want to give up for the price difference, slower frames per second, (no off camera flash control - edit, the 60D does have this control), different body construction, and I'm not a fan of the flip LCD screen.I've fallen back in love with an SLR camera.

Now I want my own (so that's three). I see why its selling so well. Its extraordinary quality video in low light situations, its quality file format, and its low cost for a camera with the advantage of being able to use various lenses, especially fast lenses for depth of field limiting control makes it a better choice for our work than a prosumer HD \"video camera.\"Video has never been so much fun.  Now there is a whole lot of artistic control possible that I am interested in exploring. I suspect there will be many other amateurs who will find fun with manual video using a DSLR like the 7D.  Its total manual control makes it challenging, fun, and capable of video that you can be pleased with (no matter how amateur) because you had control, you had choice and you used all your skills, no matter how slight at the time.  Its very addictive and many amateurs will be carried away with artistic enthusiasm, providing you have the patience to practice.If you are new to DSLR video as I was (still am, certainly), expect many days of practice (well, its been two weeks and there is still a lot of skill to master - especially in follow focus) to get good clips.  Plan your shots and use a tripod as much as possible. Also, I think its essential to have a viewer and focusing knob such as the IDC Run & Gun.  Google it.  I can't imagine how anyone can get good video clips without this simple but well engineered add-on. Again, I think this device is essential to getting good clips. Again, I think this device is essential to getting good clips (get it).My favorite switching lenses:  Canon EF 50mm f/1:1.4 and Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/1:2.8.  We, and I personally, do not have much use for the 18-135mm lens that came with the cameras and should have purchased just the body.I added the BeachTek DXA-5D under the camera so I could use my two XLR shotgun mikes on a bar attached to the top shoe and I also use two Earthworks omni's there too.  For less critical sound I attach the Rode stereo video mike.MORE ADDED FOR DSLR VIDEO AMATEURS:Because I suspect relative amateurs (like me) will be interested in this camera for its video to break into creativity not possible with fixed lens video cameras, here is some advice to avoid frustration using your fantastic video files from your new Canon 7d:Some will be frustrated that they can not play the video clips on their PC's after transferring them to their hard drive.  Some will be frustrated they can not edit the H.264 codec Quicktime .MOV file format as they come off the camera in even very expensive editing software.  Download and purchase CineForm Neo Scene and convert all your clip files to .AVI.  This is highly recommended by many professionals.Want to get your Canon 7d clips easily and quickly to disk and view HD video using a DVD or a BluRay Player or hand them to others to view?  I highly recommend the inexpensive Sothink HD Movie Maker software from SourceTec Software Co.  Its very inexpensive and its a quick download.  Just add your clips to the editor with the \"Add\" button and click the \"Burn\" button.  The software doesn't do much else so there is no learning curve. You can put many HD clips onto inexpensive DVD disks.  And if the video clips are precious, please burn them to 300 year archival Gold disks such as those by Kodak.", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon's Flagship Crop Body", "Author": "ScottieD", "ReviewID": "R12AXVGY6KLRF2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Reading through the reviews here I have been seeing a common trend of problems with the camera, or I should say user. A lot of users are going to be upgrading from their entry level DSLR like a T2i or d3100. You have to remember this is NOT a point and shoot camera like entry level cameras are. There are so many more settings and factors that will effect the photos you get. I have had this camera for about 6 months now and it has been quite a learning curve. Instead of complaining that the camera doesn't take great pictures, I learned how to work with the camera to get great pictures that i would never have been able to get with the t3i I upgraded from.Why?The main reason to buy this camera is: its much faster, more accurate, more advanced, 19 point cross-type AF system. Again, there are many settings that effect how the AF will function, and its up to you, the user to determine the settings you want to use. This camera also provides a micro adjustment for each lens to get your focusing better than you could have with an entry level DSLR. And remember that there is a dioptric adjustment. If you think you are seeing \"fuzzy\" or \"not focused\" pictures, its because you did not adjust this and its because of your eyes, NOT the camera.This camera is very well suited for action photography. Noise is very clean up till ISO 3200 which makes getting action shots a breeze.This camera has some sort of weather sealing which makes it a good camera to take outdoors on a rainy day.To get the most out of this camera you MUST be shooting RAW and be WILLING to do some post production.Having 8fps shooting, and basically an unlimited buffer has allowed me to get many more shots than i would ever be able to get before.It has a MUCH larger viewfinder than an entry level dslr.The AF works wonders in low light.The battery lasts me around 2k+ shots on most days.When I first received this camera I was disappointed.  I would snap two identical pictures on the 7D and on the t3i. For some reason I thought the t3i took better pictures. The t3i's display is quite sharp and gives you a false sense of the pictures you take. In reality when I would put both photos on photoshop and begin editing them, the 7Ds photos were sharper and had less noise.Dont expect to get low noise like a FullFrame body like the 5D. This camera IS susceptible to low ISO noise in certain conditions. Review your settings and turn off all in-camera noise reduction.A few quick facts about this camera:The t2i/t3i, 60D, and 7D share almost identical sensors. The 7D has DUAL processors which allows it to have substantially better AF and faster shooting. Technically these cameras should take very similar pictures. The 7D is Canon's flagship Crop-Sensor Body.Finally- put your money where your lenses are. An \"L\" series canon lens is going to do much more for you than upgrading your body.In all I am in LOVE with this body and Im very glad I upgraded to it. Even though this camera was released in 2009, Canon is still providing firmware updates that increases its performance. The last updated increased its RAW and RAW+JPEG buffer and added manual audio adjustment.Happy shooting!", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, poor quality control!", "Author": "BookWorm", "ReviewID": "R2CZJEJM04LF79", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although the camera deserves many stars (see the positive ratings here), I rated it as 1 star in order to draw attention of potential buyers to the quality control issues. I wanted something faster focusing than my Pentax K-x with better low light performance. After a lot of reading I decided on 7D with 70-200mm F4 IS lens (yes, F2.8 is faster but much less portable and more expensive).Unpacked, read through the manual (extremely well written and controls are pretty intuitive), took some pics inside with artificial lighting at ISO 200 and got a strange feeling. The shutter sounded like a slamming door, there was a \"visible\" lag between the lens focus and shutter release and the shutter speed was around 1/8! Took it outside, the same impression, the exposure WAS WRONG (either went to ISO 3200 in broad daylight or stayed at 100-200 with slow shutter speed. The pics were bleak and mostly out of focus. Tried spot focusing, IS off, different metering modes, Tv, Av etc. Nothing worked. Thought that I might have screwed up some setting when getting used to the camera, reset to defaults, the same story. Tried to find a local dealer to see, if the problems was in the camera or the lens. Not many of them carry 7D and those who do weren't eager to open a new box just for the sake of experimentation. Finally put the lens on T1i, worked flawlessly. Started Googling and discovered that $1700 top of the line semi-pro camera has a known autofocus issues!!!The suggested \"hard reset\" - taking out the camera Li-battery and the `watch' battery that keeps the date/time stored (You'll lose your date/time setting as well as your image numbering, all your custom settings including your custom menu are not lost) for an hour alleviated the problem, need more time for testing. WORD OF CAUTION: according to Google defective cameras that do not respond to the reset cannot be fixed by Canon (they keep sending it back and forth), do your own reading! Even if the reset had worked, I will either exchange the camera for a good copy or get Nikon 300s instead. Would be too risky to take chances after the warranty expires...Very disappointing, lemons do happen but that's what the quality control is for, especially with this price tag.Make sure that you buy 7D from a local store or Amazon, don't go for cheaper shady sellers!!!P.S. If you have problems, make sure it's the camera and not the wrong setting. Here is a very useful quotation form comments of Electric Boogaloo to another 1 star rating:Before giving it a 1-star you need to verify the AF in aperture priority and shutter priority using a single AF point and multiple AF points. It is also important to remember to set the proper Custom Function III.The AF on the 7D is better than what most people who shoot casually need and it has a learning curve. Shooting in full auto may also give you bad results.C.Fn III-1 (Tracking Sensitivity): slow (this is on fast by default)C.Fn III-2 (1st/2nd image priority): 0 (AF priority/Tracking priority)C.Fn III-3 (Tracking Method): 1C.Fn III-4 (Lens drive when AF impossible): 1 (focus search off)C.Fn III-5 (AF microadjust): 0 (disable)C.Fn III-6 (AF area selection mode): Single point, Expansion, SpotC.Fn III-7 (Manual AF point selection): 0 (stop)C.Fn III-8 (VF illumination): 0 (auto)C.Fn III-9 (Display all AF points): 0 (disable)C.Fn III-10 (Focus display in AI servo/MF): 0 (enable)C.Fn III-11 (AF assist beam firing): 1 (Disable)C.Fn III-12 (orientation link): 1 (Different)C.Fn III-13 (mirror lockup): 0 (disable)In Comparison, the Nikon D300s does not have a full auto mode. I would not recommend this camera to anyone who shoots full auto, it was a mistake by Canon to put the \"green box\" on the dial.*****Happy owners of good copies of 7D started bushing me for 1*. I repeat, this comment is aimed as a warning to the potential buyers who usually read carefully all positive (that are plenty and rightfully so) and all negative reviews and spend less time on in-between reading.

The new king of APS-C", "Author": "Arcturus", "ReviewID": "R1ST7RAOE1MVK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is absolutely fantastic. The AF is spot on, and the IQ is sublime.Whilst I don't doubt that there are a few 'duds' out there I also strongly believe that a vast majority of bad reviews and hate are down to total inexperience. This is a very well featured and advanced camera, but it's priced at a level that attracts a number of new DSLR users.Some people say that it's soft, or that it needs the best lenses there are to get sharp results.....Total BS. I just used an old (but good) Vivitar 70-210mm f/3.5 Series 1 zoom from the late 70's, and let me tell you; The output was TACK SHARP. I'm not doubting that L glass would provide even better results, but this camera is by no means soft. Even the 28-135mm kit lens produces excellent results, plus it's a joy to use.The majority of forum threads stating that the 7D is soft have ended up being one of a few things;a) The user's lens needed slight micro adjustmentb) The user was using the wrong AF mode/zone for the style of shot they were taking (VERY COMMON)c) The user was a novice and had been using too low a shutter speed or too small an aperture (I even saw f22 on one  thread, causing massive diffraction)The AF system on this camera is very advanced, and very precise. If you're going to leave it on 19 point AF with AI Servo then don't complain or blame the camera when it chooses a focus point other than the one you wanted! It will choose the first point that it can lock to, this is what it is meant to do.I shot for 3 days solid with this camera. I liked it one day one, but by the end of day 3 I LOVED IT. The RAW output is very different from what I'm used to, and I had to work on my methods a little to get the most out of the 7D's CR2 files, but now I have it nailed I am extremely happy with my output.I also still get very confused when I see people viewing AN 18 MEGAPIXEL IMAGE AT 100%!! Why, oh why would you do that? Do you realise how large that image is? Of course you're going to find some sort of noise at that magnification, especially when you're sat half a metre from your screen! It's ridiculous.Sorry that this review has been of the non technical nature, I feel that most bases have already been well covered in that respect, I just get so tired of silly reviews slating a camera that just requires a little more skill and patience to use properly.If you don't know why you might need the 7D then you probably don't.....Buy a Rebel, they're great.If you know what you're doing, and you recognise the advanced features and capabilities of the 7D....GO FOR IT, this camera is exceptional. And remember; the rare cases of a bad copy get shouted about the loudest.P.S. The guy that slated it for video yet claims to be a Videographer....Actually forget it, I don't even know where to start with you.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Why you should or shouldn't buy the 7D", "Author": "Sidehop", "ReviewID": "R8Q7LETJYW102", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is going to be more for photographers that have some experience with DSLR and looking to upgrade.I've owned the Canon 20D, 60D and now purchased the 6D (full frame) but bought a mint condition 7D recently.  I wanted a second body that can compliment each other for events and as a backup but did not have the funds to purchase two 5D MKIII or pro body like 1D-series.  Nor I would get such setup unless my profession was an event/wedding photographer which I am not.  I consider myself as an advanced hobbyist making some money here and there but more than anything enjoy photography.  Having the 6D and 7D fills in a lot of voids that two bodies were lacking.Unlike the 7D's cropped sensor, full frame bodies do tend to do better in low light, give you a bit more creamy bokeh and offer wider view (if you're coming from a cropped body that is) .  Even then, a semi-pro crop body like this 7D still can shoot wide with the right lens, have more reach (x1.6 after all) and still have great image with low light compared to other xxD series like the 60D, 50D, etc.  I shot with the 60D for about six months and the camera did an amazing job in low light with the right setup.  If you've ever shot with much older xxD series like the 10D or the 20D you know it's not exactly a low-light camera especially with astrophotography.Full frame bodies like 6D & 5D MKIII has its limitation when shooting fast moving subject like birds, baseball pitcher throwing a ball and football being caught out in the filed.  Yes, you can still shoot fast action especially with 5D MKIII but if higher frame rate is a top priority then you'll need this body if not the 1D X (specifically meant for wildlife & sports).  Even my old 20D did 'okay' with 5fps but at times it missed a lot of actions as well as focus was sub-par at best.  Without spending thousands, the 7D's 8fps is a very nice feature. While it's no 1D X, it does a good job especially when used outdoors with the right lens.I also decided to get the 7D as my 6D wasn't keeping up with the buffer (even with high speed SDXC card) and going to be shooting a lot of kid's events my daughter will be involved & for the town I live in.  I also know when I want more zoom and buy a longer focal length lens the 7D will do a superb job in capturing those details.<<Not Much of a Con>>Really the only con I've found is having to use compact flash cards that are generally more expensive.  I just assume this is due to manufacturing cost of the cards and it's different architecture but seems more rugged and faster than a regular SDHC/SDXC format.  Of course there's no dual slot with the 7D so for important events, I wouldn't risk anything but carry a second body and/or second card.<<When to Consider the 7D>>Who should get the 7D?  Advanced shooter that require more auto focusing point & frame rate in capturing actions shots like baseball, basketball, wildlife/bird photography and getting the best image out of a cropped body.  8fps gives you much better chance of obtaining that award winning shot with more auto focus points (than the 6D) for better accuracy.  With the very fast auto focusing points (more than 6D) and superb image quality, you cannot discount 7D's capability just because it's not a full frame body.  7D is the top of the line x1.6 crop body currently aside from professional grade body like the 1D X.The 7D's crop body also means if you have quality lens like the Canon 70-200 f/anything you can shoot an object much further without having to buy extenders or more expensive lens with longer focal length.  With a full frame camera, this could mean more money to spend depending on the type of shoot you're looking to do.  Again, this all depends on the type of photos you're taking.  But consider if you buy a used 7D (often times with low shutter count) and pair it with 70-200 f/4L or even the f/2.8L IS II as well as the 100-400 f4.5 then it maybe a better match for those that shoot wildlife and sports more often.  It'll certain save you more money than spending $3,000+ on a 5D MKIII.<<When to Consider Another Body>>7D is like the 60D (same sensor on both) but with faster shutter speeds, more auto focus points, bigger buffer and overall designed for speed.  With that said, if you don't shoot wildlife, birds, sports, motorsports and shoot more portraits and landscapes then you may not need the 7D.If you're new to DSLR & photography then read this portion.  When you're new to DSLR or photography in general, you're likely shooting everything & anything in sight (I did that for awhile as well).  But you'll soon realize your passion and want a body specific to the type of photography that suit your taste.  Not everyone is going to be a professional in every area of photography.  It's like trying to become a mechanical/civil/electrical engineer all at once.  Doable of course but you'll see most professional working as a photographer for a living has a very specific area they work with.If you're still not sure, go with an entry level body like the Canon t4i, t5i, 50D, 60D or the new 70D that take great photos, has continuous auto-focus feature (available with t4i, t5i & 70D) and still can shoot good action shots.  Buy the body only and get quality zoom or prime lens.  Lens investment go a long way in photography as they will likely outlast the camera body but without quality over time (as long as you don't drop kick them).Dedicated video shooters should also consider the new 70D, t5i or the t4i with the continuous (key word) auto focus feature.  You'd have to do this manually or having to press the shutter button with the 7D and even the 6D.  A bit of a learning curve if you also focus manually.  Video shooters should also get any lens with \"STM\" with it's quiet motor when the camera auto focuses.Yes, more expensive DSLR's paired with expensive lens can get you better image quality \"to a degree\" but it won't make you look professional either.  There's a rather big learning curve from learning the DSLR functionality, basics of photography then being able to process them in Lightroom or Photoshop can be very much overwhelming.  You don't need a $3,000 DSLR because it will not I guarantee you give you those professional quality images on the first day nor the first few months.  I just don't want people to think expensive body & lens will give them a phenomenal photo because you will be very disappointed.If you're an advanced shooter, enjoy portraits, landscape, low light shooting (with or without artificial lights) and want the best image possible in any given light then 6D, 5D MKII or the 5D MKIII maybe your best bet.  Personally I'd pick the 6D over the 5D MKII as the low light performance is much better.  Portrait photographers, landscape photographers and astrophotographers (especially!) would benefit from other body like the 6D and 5D MKIII.  6D is said to be the current low light shooter champ so that is much to consider.  Full frame cameras also allows better bokeh but not so much that it will blow your mind either.  But that slight difference can mean a lot to others.<>It's a fantastic body you won't regret.  Just know what you shoot and want from the camera and its limitation.  Not every camera has ALL the function a photographer needs or will ever be offered.  You can spend $6,000+ on a pro body but it still won't give you all the features you want.  But the 7D aside from under performing on the high ISO area, overall it still does an amazing job.  If full frame isn't your priority, I'd take this over the 5D MKII's.  Side by side it seems to do well in par if not better than the MKII's.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "K. L.

I have done family portraits to Quincea\u00f1eras and it always performs.

Hawk", "ReviewID": "R3FJNJSU06L8MD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered mine a little late to the game; my Canon 40D had the shutter fail, and I debated long and hard on what would be a true upgrade to that camera, without breaking the bank.I wasn't in the market for a full frame camera, so that narrowed it down to a used 50D (a new one cost more on Amazon at least than the 7D), the new 60D, or a new 7D.60D missed a few key points on my check-list - auto-focus is key in motorsports photography, which while not my primary focus is something I do frequently. Build quality was another concern, and it seemed as though Canon really dumbed the 60D down deliberately from the 50D (or 40D for that matter) to save a bit of manufacturing costs. Less dedicated buttons, no joystick, worse auto-focus, and while yes, it is cheaper by a few hundred dollars, my feeling of value for $ just wasn't met.The 50D I actually really liked; not a super upgrade from the 40D, and if I could have found a new one for $800 I probably would have gone with it. The fact that it cost the same or more than the 7D on every site I could find it on put it right off my list.Onto the 7D - first, the autofocus. Head and shoulders above the 40D, 50D, and 60D. It's sick. You have to use it to see what I'm talking about, but selectable area from the joystick, or 19 point selection, or autoselect; usable, and fast. I will say that the liveview has more issues with focus than without; this isn't something I use very often, but when I do, its noticeably slower. However, manual focus from liveview is great; a click of the + button and you can go from 5x to 10x magnification on the screen to get that perfect focus - the display is high quality and really helps lock in focus when you use it in this manner. Good for tripod/portrait shots (not something you'd use in situations requiring fast focus anyway)The menu system and features are very well laid out; if you've used a Canon camera this should all be familiar anyway, and there are a few extra bells and whistles coming from the 40D that I noticed; primarily autofocus but being able to limit autoISO is a nice feature as well (if you own this camera and don't have that, update your firmware). Ridiculously fast burst speed - I mean 8fps is getting close to full motion; if you need speed and don't have $8000 to spend on a camera, the argument is over, get the 7D.Image quality - better than the 40D which is to be expected, but not lightyears ahead. I'd expect images between the 50D and 7D to be fairly similar. Having the extra pixels to play with is always nice; 18MP for me is fairly future proof. I think excellent results can be had to ISO 1600 - very usable at 3200 for web based images; 6400 ISO is pushing it a bit but still usable for web and black and white.View finder is excellent. The autofocus and grid display are both unobtrusive and usable. Battery life is great. Camera is actually pretty lightweight, weather sealed as well.Is it with the $1200 Amazon charges? Yes. Is this a futureproof camera? For a mirrored full sized SLR, I'd say yes. I would never need a FASTER camera than this. I'd be hard pressed to justify more MP than this, even more so on an APS-C sensor. Digital cameras have just come so far from where they were a few years ago, and this being an older camera I think like film cameras of old will end up becoming a classic. I thought about buying this used, but I didn't want to have to worry about the shutter being replaced in a year, so I just bought it new.Video - no idea. Haven't shot any. Reviews show its fairly awesome, so thats as far as I can go with that.Honestly, I don't think there is a better Canon APS-C on the market at the moment, and the next version of this will likely cost $600 to $800 more. Hence, I just bought it new, and hope to enjoy it for years. Bottom line, if you need the speed, and the best auto focus system on the market (right up there with the 5D Mark II, Mark III, or 1D Mark II), I think you'd be happy with this purchase.If you don't and just want a decent APS-C camera?

But I just have to share some thoughts on this camera.Things that amaze me:-The Auto Focus system. Most of the time I use all 19 AF points and let the camera decide. And I'm amazed at how it gets it right most of the time. Sometimes in a tricky situation it may miss it. (EDIT: 5/10/11: I no longer use all 19 points. I switch between point and expansion for precision focusing. But still, the sheer number of options in the AF system is amazing.-The Auto Focus in dim light. I love how even in a dark room I'll get the camera out to take a shot and I'm amazed that it could find focus. This is something my XSi could not do. Not even close.-Movie Mode. I'm a DSLR guy that likes movie mode. Why not have movie mode in a camera? I like shooting little clips and I plan do use this ability to provide additional services for my customers. Great quality clips.-Ergonomics. This is an area that is subject to opinion. Some people like Nikon grips better. That's ok, no reason to fight. I personally like Canon grips infinitely better. This is a very very comfortable EOS to hold.Things that are great:-Image quality. The image quality of this camera is very good. It's not a good deal better than anything else these days. Nikons, Canons, Sonys, they all take great pictures.-Back LCD. It's sharp and clear. 921,000K pixel resolution is a huge step up from the LCD of the XSi.-Magnesium Alloy body. An all metal body makes this camera a tough one. The metal body is sturdy and feels much more substancial than plastic Rebels.-Weather Sealing. I haven't had a chance to use this feature but I like the fact that I can shoot in the rain with this thing. (as long as I have a weather sealed lens as well)-Wireless Flash transmitter: This camera has a wireless flash transmitter for controlling off camera Speedlites. I love this feature.-8 fps. 8 frames per second. Great for catching action. And it's still 8fps in 14bit RAW, something the Nikon D300s can not do. I have a 90mb/s memory card and I get about 19 shoots in a burts of 14bit RAWs. Shooting in Jpeg with NR off I believe you can shoot at 8fps until the memory card is full.Things that are good:-ISO performance. This is a crop sensor camera. Which means the ISO performance isn't going to be as good as the 5D Mark II or the Nikon D3s. That being said, for a crop body it's good performance. I get clean images through 1600, usable a bit beyond 3200 (4000 is ok), usable at 6400 if the situation is right. I've never tried to take a serious picture at 12800 so I'm not sure how it would look. I've taken test shots and it isn't pretty, but I do think it could be used if you got lucky. I'm ok with this performance.Things that are not good:-There isn't anything about this camera that I don't really like. For a crop body camera it is the best option on the market. The Nikon D7000 is a cheaper camera and does have a few advantages over the 7D. It's a comparable camera but it isn't a better camera. And that's ok, because the D7000 wasn't meant to go up against the 7D. We'll have to see what the successor to the D300s can do.Bottom line:This is a fantastic camera that will serve you very well as long as you do not need a full frame camera. I do intend on going FF asap but for now this is a great step in the pro direction. And, this may be important to know, I will not sell this camera.

Manzo", "ReviewID": "RNPY01HPIOIRS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As an aspiring videographer I was on the hunt for a camera that could shoot stellar video without having to spend $10,000. The Canon 7D was the perfect option for me. I bought it about 6 months ago and have gotten a ton of use out of it ever since then.This is my first DSLR camera so it took some time for me to get to learn how to use it and discover the features and differences of a typical video camera. I'm writing this review from a pure video stance since that's mainly what I use it for, and I hope it can help others who are looking at the video capabilities.The picture this camera produces is nothing short of outstanding. I recently finished a rather large project with it and once I exported and everything I just couldn't believe the outstanding quality it had produced. I often shoot sports highlights with it and several of my colleagues shoot using Sony EX3s (a $10,000 camera). Side by side, many have said that the picture produced by the 7D is superior. If you're looking to make a short film on a budget, this is the perfect answer. I honestly don't think from a video standpoint you're getting that much more with the 5D mkII. I do know that I am in love with this camera, and use it more than I ever expected to.I will outline some of the cons I see in it however.First, I find it a little more difficult to shoot handheld video on this than a regular video camera with a shoulder mount. You have to have some very steady hands to keep the picture looking nice. That said, I also love the portability of it in comparison. I got shots off the top of a rappel tower I couldn't come close to getting with a standard video camera.I'd like more options on aspect ratio and frame rate. There are only so many settings and you get locked into them. For example, I can shoot 1920x1080 at either 24p or 30p. I would LOVE the option to shoot 60p. The only option available for shooting in SD isn't a 16:9 (widescreen) option. I always end up shooting in HD and down-converting later on. It clearly has the capabilities end to end, I'd just like to be able to independently manipulate these options.Another con is audio. The on board mic is fine for nat sound. It actually works better than I expect it to a lot of times. It's just when you're trying to capture high quality audio without background noise where it gets tricky. It also only has a mini-jack input and it isn't always feasible to record directly to the camera. Recently, I used a low price lav mic with a mini jack that worked really well, but I hated that I couldn't see my audio levels on screen and really had no way to adjust them coming into the camera. You just kind of have to go on blind faith.Overall though, a FANTASTIC product. People are consistently impressed with the product I produce with this tiny camera. It shoots wonderful video and I am extremely pleased with my decision to purchase it.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Plan on Spending a Lot More!", "Author": "Justin Bogley", "ReviewID": "R2X7FE12O088KW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is intended for amatuer photographers who want better image quality and higher versatility than a point and shoot camera.The Canon 7D is an absolute gem.  It is my first DSLR after owning a film SLR, then 3 point and shoot digital cameras over the last decade.  I purchased mine with the 28-135mm lens.  I would highly recommend buying the body itself, then finding a different lens to fit your needs.  Remember, this is a 1.6x crop factor camera, so 28mm is not wide angle at all.  The 18-135mm would probably be a better choice for a first inexpensive(relatively) walk around lens.After struggling to learn this camera for a few hundred shots, I finally was able to get some really nice photos.  Don't get discouraged, there is a definite learning curve here!  Portraits, and close up shots of pets, etc. are the 28-135mm lens's specialty.  My next priority was investing in a wider angle lens as soon as possible, as I love taking landscape shots.  So I purchased the Tokina 12-24mm lens as soon as I could afford it, and I was not disappointed.  It pairs with the 7D to take stunning landscape photos.After owning and enjoying the 7D and these two lenses for nearly a year, I couldn't help feeling that I wasn't using this spectacular camera to it's fullest potential.  So just recently, I purchased the Canon 300mm f/4L lens for taking wildlife and bird photos.  The difference in clarity, contrast, sharpness, and overall image quality from the other lenses is huge!  And the 8 frames per second is wonderful in action.  I can now see the potential of this wonderful camera, and it will only be realized with very expensive lenses.  I plan on selling my first two lenses, and investing in a wide angle L lens such as the 16-35mm or 17-40mm.  The good news is that camera lenses seem to hold their value very well as long as they are treated with care.Another invaluable accessory is a tripod, which will run about $150 to $1000 for a nice sturdy unit.  Forego plastic tripods, as you will be buying another one in the near future after it breaks.  You will probably soon want to invest in an external flash as well for much better low-light shots.  Look into Cokin filters for some really neat effects, and a good quality photo editing software is also a must.This is all just the beginning, as there are numerous other accessories that are all worthwhile, and will allow you to fully utilize your 7D.  I am hooked, and I fully believe that the satisfaction I get from taking professional quality pictures is worth evey penny.You can really take some great shots with a 7D and the kit lens, and I'm sure that many people are satisfied with that lens/camera combination.  But if you are thinking of buying this camera, chances are it will just not be enough for you.  Definitely look at buying this camera as a first step in a wonderful, fulfilling hobby that will have your friends and family amazed at your photos.  Plus, if you've ever wanted to have your own photography business, you now have a great deal of the tools to do so.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "7D great for sports and wildlife!", "Author": "atlbraves5656", "ReviewID": "R1MIIRY7VYWLNL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not much for writing reviews but for this I had to.  Below are the pros and cons I have seen.Pros:Auto-focus: Fast and accurate.  Distance it is not so good for (ex. bird flying against a background in which they blend in, most cameras have issues with this) but all normal circumstances it performs excellently.SPEED:  8 FPS, that makes my 5D2 look as slow as a snail.  People turn heads when you fire this camera.EASE OF USE:  You can easily customize your buttons.  Easily separate shutter from AF of whatever you would like to do.  Great addition by Canon.ISO SENSITIVITY:  Though this is what i would expect from any DSLR with this price tag, the ISO sensitivity is awesome.  6400 will give you grainy pics but that is better than completely missing it, right?Cons:ISO: As mentioned above 6400 is grainy, I avoid if possibly but sometimes you have to use it.  The full frame of the 5D2 trumps over the 7D in low-light performance.Video:  Like the 5D2, I still think the video function is very raw.  No quick auto-focus.  Do NOT buy any DSLR because it has video on it.  Horrible idea.  Will not work unless you know 100% what you are doing.Buy this camera if the 5D2 is out of your price range.  It is a great camera but realize the difference a full frame camera makes.  If you can save up more money, go for the 5D2.  The 7D works great for me as a supplement to my 5D2.  For sports and wildlife opportunities, this camera is awesome.  The 5D2 gets everything else.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Canon 7D is a 5 Star Camera", "Author": "wdwpsu \"wdwpsu\"", "ReviewID": "R3JTA5KSV8RQW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I intentionally waited before reviewing this camera.  When it first came out, I was a little dissapointed.  Not so much with the camera, but with the typical industry adoption rate.  Lack of Adobe Lightroom support on Day 1, was a very painful price of being an early adopter.Having had this camera now for several months, I have to say it's got everything I need it for and more.  I use it for weddings, portraits, wildlife, sports and video, and it doesn't skip a beat.  This is by far the most versatile camera out there.  True, the 5DMk2 may take better images when you zero in on the pixels, but this is VERY close behind that.  And, the 5dMK2 won't give me the high FPS that I need for sports and wildlife photography, not to mention how amazing the focus is on this camera.I think the only thing \"wrong\" with this camera is the price.  Canon easily could have charged more for it!", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Struggled with the decision with the upgrade from a 40D - What was I thinking?", "Author": "Amazon Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R21SJFM7GQSAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading all the reviews (thanks to Amazon for this feature)  on the 7D and the 5D I struggled for months with a decision to upgrade my 40D.  Loved my 40D but I wanted higher ISO and faster FPS. Do I go with the 7D? 5D? or stay where I am?  People seem to love the 5D but I really wanted the higher burst rate. Was the 7D really worth saving the $$ versus the 5D? Was it worth the spending the $$ over my 40D?After sending my 40D in for service I called Canon Service and spoke to a technician about my 40D and in passing asked him about the 7D vs. 5D vs. 40D.  He was extremely helpful and asked a lot of questions about what type of photos I took (sports - hockey, family stills, vacation) and what lenses I used (70-200 2.8 IS L & 20-70m 2.8 L) and suggested the 7D due to the burst rate and other features (ISO, etc.). Saw a pro photographer at a concert using a 7D and a 5D and he gave the thumbs up on the 7D and the burst rate. Those two conversations made my decision. I bought it for my vacation.Got the 7D and all I can say is WOW!  Can't believe I waited or struggled with the decision. Great detail and color. Was very easy to learn - very similar to the 40D.  Love the ability to get JPEG & RAW at the same time.  The burst rate is awesome. Worried about catching people with their eyes closed? No problem when you have 6+ FPS burst rate.  The pictures are AMAZING - what clarity.  There is a difference between RAW output and JPEG - obviously raw is much better - but getting raw & JPEGs (I always shot in raw and had to convert) are the best of both worlds - great for the quick and instant viewing on any computer and still have the RAW for post processing.  Yep, you need a lot of memory on your CF card but that's no surprise. I'm getting 400+ pictures on a 16GB card using RAW and extra fine JPEG. Was worried about the autofocus issues some people wrote about but I have had no issues.  The autofocus is way faster than the 40D and different in a good way.  High ISO is great.  Took pictures in near dark at 1600+ ISO and the graininess is not noticeable to me until past 2K.  The 3 inch display is awesome as well - really helps. Battery life?  Haven't had an issue but bought another one for back-up purposes. I was a bit ticked at having to buy another baterry at $80 since I already have two with my 40D and it seems like a waste - but I'm sure there's a reason. Right Canon?  You probably want to get at least a 16 GB card with 60 MB/s.  I've used my old 4GB and 8GB without issues but it nice to have the extra space and speed to shoot JPEG and RAW at a high FPS.Haven't tried HD Video but I didn't buy it for that reason.All in all, I couldn't be happier with the 7D.  I know it's not a full frame (I'm not sure I miss the difference) but I'm happy for now - until Canon comes out with a 5D with a better burst rate and some other great features - then I'll probably start the process all over.  But for now - very happy with the camera and my investment. I've taken about 1,000 pictures so far and am constantly amazed at how life like they are - a noticable improvement in Image Quality versus the 40D.Saved the $1K versus the 5D and very thankful to the Canon tech.  Probably buy another lens. I'm sure some of the early adoptors of the 7D had some issues but I have none to report.So if you're struggling with the decision like I did, I hope this review helps - I'm a big fan of the 7D. Can't wait for my son's hockey season. Thanks to Canon for another great product! Bought on Amazon because of past experiences and they use reputable dealers.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Only good to say about this camera.", "Author": "Patrick Perdu", "ReviewID": "R2UV31DKSNPG2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I have been pondering going full frame for some time, I am postponing the switch out of concern for my pocketbook and because this 7D has been giving me lots of joy for the year I have had it.I shoot a lot; kids, parties, performance art with available light, sport etc. plus I am getting into home studio portrait and strobism with a pair of speedlights and this camera works beautifully and reliably.In a year I reached above 30 000 frames, nearly no video (I do stills).Side equipment I would recommend - I don't have tons of lenses and gear so I can't speak about everything there is out there but here is what I gathered around that camera that I really use all the time. I am very happy with what I can do with this stuff.LENSESAll three lenses are quite pricey and well-built and give gorgeous pictures that the 7D sensor captures with minute details.- I already had a 70-200mm f/4 L IS USM from a few years back. This lens remains one of my very favorite.- I bought the 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM with this 7D, also a full frame-capable lens with in mind a future upgrade to a full-frame body like the 5D-III.- I recently procured the Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM, which is a crop-sensor only lens - it will not work on the 1D, 5D or 6D but I really wanted a wide-angle lens and this one is just beautiful.With these three I can do almost all I want.If I had known I would have bought the 7D body only and foregone the 18-135mm hich is ok but really not as enjoyable as the ones listed above.LIGHTAdd to that a Canon TTL flash or two such as- the 430EX II,- the 580EX II,- or the 600EX-RT (for a comparison based on spec sheet with the 580, see my review of the 580Ex-II)and you are all set.You will likely find that you want some more lighting equipment but this is beyond the scope of this review.SOFTWAREIt comes with a software bundle that covers all the bases but following the advice of a pro photographer friend of mine I still added Lightroom v.4.0, and I am very glad I did. I wish I had known of it earlier.The 7D is a great camera, very simple to use, yet provides a wealth of possibilities for technically inclined amateur like me.- Once I got used to its basic controls, I found that the camera does not get in the way of taking the picture. This to me is probably the most important, even before image quality.- The sensor gives beautiful, vibrant images - the color rendering is very close to what I see with my eyes, which is my criterion.- The sensor also features a native ISO range of up to 6400 and at ISO 3200 the pictures are really good.- Flash control is excellent - I frequently use the remote flash control from the camera with a 580Ex-II and a 430Ex-II together and the possibilities are staggering.- The JPEG you get directly from the camera are gorgeous. I rarely shoot raw due to the size of the resulting files except when doing landscape or portrait, and the dedicated button that switches to raw+JPEG for the next picture is very useful to me.There are many more good things to say about this camera but I would find myself re-writing the manual, which is informative, well written and well-worth reading from cover to cover.All in all a great camera, the best I ever had and one of the easiest to use.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "7D", "Author": "Fred Meebley", "ReviewID": "RAGD6ML775GAN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera since shortly after it was launched. It was a huge step up from the Rebel XT that it replaced. I like the size and weight of the body and the configuration of the buttons and screens. It is an easy camera to use from an ergonomics standpoint. The image quality that it produces is great if I do my part as a photographer. The noise is minimal up to ISO 1250 as long as I don't underexpose the image and try to bring up the exposure in Photoshop. I almost always shoot in RAW format so white-balance isn't a big issue for me, however I find the auto white-balance to be very accurate. My old cameras used to always give me yellow looking photos if shot indoors under artificial light, my 7d doesn't do this ever. The auto-focus gives me better results by far than my Rebel, especially using the outer focus points. I love that the camera remembers which focus point I used last for both portrait and landscape orientation. I like the option to use micro focus adjustment for each of my lenses. This feature has allowed all my prime lenses to become excellent copies. Thanks Canon for finally giving us a crop sensor body with good auto-focus and a quality build. Thank you as well for the excellent firmware 2.0 upgrade.", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for Sports!", "Author": "pab", "ReviewID": "RGAPS1Z1JKIG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content":

The focusing is fast and the fps is awesome!  I've shot a night game and using 6400 ISO (and lightroom NR) the shots turn out amazing.  Truly an exceptional camera.Seeing that a picture is worth a 1000 words, I decided to post a video slideshow with a few of my images. I know some people may say that the noise at higher ISOs is not that good with this camera, but I disagree.  All of the images in this video were taken at ISO 6400 with NR done in Lightroom 3.  I hope that the video can display how amazing this camera is at this high ISO.  The images were taken from a shoot at a night game between LSU and West Virginia, as well as at the Lion King in Walt Disney and the Halloween party at Walt Disney as well.How good this camera is at high ISO truly opens the door to some great photo opportunities.  If I was only using a camera that went up to ISO 1600 or 3200, I would miss out on a lot of shots.  With this camera, I feel confident that even at higher ISOs, the images will be solid.This is my first video so I hope it helps.

The build quality is superior. It feels rugged. The switches and dials function well and with ease. The controls are easy to comprehend. Adjustments can be made quickly. There is a noticeable picture quality difference from what I was use to with the Rebel. Lenses I thought were just weak perform better when matched up with this 7D. I enjoy being able to take pictures without flash so I appreciate the ISO capabilities on this camera. I have turned it up pretty high and quality stays satisfactory. (I'm no pro so there isn't too much nitpicking with me...) I would make the same choice again unless I'd won the lottery. (Then I'd buy a Mark 1) Generally speaking I am very happy with my choice.

I've had it for exactly 11 months (today!) and took just shy of 10,000 pictures in many parts of the world. One thing I noticed is its consistent output. The image quality is superb. Even at high ISO I got very good pictures. Of course at 6400 ISO (or the 12,500 which I hardly ever use) have noise, but depending one the kind of picture you're taking they're in very acceptable ranges. The 8 FPS output is remarkable even with RAW. Of course you have to have a memory card that can handle it, so I use a minimum of 60 MB/S and even with RAW I could shoot 8 FPS.The lenses I have are either L series or the 17-85 f4.5 which isn't an L but its performance is amazingly close to and L quality. The focus is extremely fast, probably better than any other camera I've used.Overall I honestly don't have anything majorly inconvenient to mention as negative. It consistently gave me beautiful photos, and I assure you, I've put it to extreme conditions including hours of shooting non-stop, and I've even taken it in really cold and humid weather.

I have not been sorry.I did read a lot of reviews, both on Amazon and elsewhere, before deciding to buy the 7D.  I won't try to duplicate any of the reviews found here, but I will say that I have never had the focus problem others report, nor have I had the 'contrast' problem some have reported.So, if I'm not going to base my review on the technical aspects of the 7D--which are more than adequately covered in other reviews here on Amazon--just why am I writing a review and why did I give it 5 stars.A few months ago, in August 2011, I was on the Oregon Coast during a particularly windy day.  The winds were gusting from zero to over 45knots and sometimes even higher.  I had just about finished taking photos for the day and was heading back to my car.  Just as I started to step upon a curb I was hit in the back by a extremely strong gust of wind, had my center of gravity pushed way out over my  outstretched leg and took a severe tumble.  I ended up breaking the lens hood on my 70-300 and slightly scratching the side of the B+W pro haze filter I had on the lens.As I was falling I attempted to pull the camera back into my body to protect it but all I managed to do was land on it and bruise three ribs when I pinned the camera between my chest and the concrete.  The pop-up flash was scratched severely in several places and the neck strap connection point was also damaged but not destroyed.  I also managed to severely cut my finger on the concrete so I wasn't thinking about my 7D (or not too much, anyway) at the time.By the time I returned home I was quite concerned about the status of my 7D.  After cleaning and bandaging my finger I gave the 7D a workout.  It performed flawlessly. To make a long story short, other than the cosmetic damages the 7D was not damaged in any way.  Everything worked just as it did before the fall.The 7D is one sturdy camera.

I am hobbyist, not a professional, but I use the camera nearly every day.  I mostly shoot with either the Canon EF-S 17-55mm 2.8IS, or the Canon 50mm 1.4 prime lens.I chose this camera because the photos I care most about are of my two toddler daughters.  This camera is marketed for fast, low-light, no flash situations - most people assume sports, but I think there are probably more people taking pictures of their young children than people doing serious sport photography.  Kids move fast and are bothered by the flash, so I was immediately interested in this camera.First, my personal opinion is that if you are not going to buy a high quality lens (not the kit lens), you should not buy this camera.  A 20D with the EF-S 17-55mm 2.8 IS lens will take much better photos than the 7D with the kit lens.  If you aren't ready to spend some money for a high quality lens, then don't buy this camera, you simply won't see an improvement in your photos.  The added megapixels will only be noticed if you are printing out poster-sized pictures, or doing extreme cropping.For the last year and a half, this camera has performed extremely well for my needs,  much better than the 20D.  I almost never use a flash for portraits, and my results are outstanding compared to my old 20D.This is not a camcorder, but I have not used our camcorder since getting the 7D.  The 7D will not re-autofocus while shooting video, and caps video at 30 minutes, so you won't be able to set it on a tripod and shoot your kid's musical or whatever.  Personally, I don't think anyone really is interested in watching more than 5 minutes of your home video anyway, and this camera works awesome for 2 minute videos of my kids singing \"I'm a little teapot.\"I have no issues with useability, but you should know that this camera does not include preset settings for macro, portrait, landscape, etc.  If you don't yet know how to set aperture and shutter speed settings, and you are not planning on learning, then you should get the 60D instead.If you are a true professional, then you probably are not reading this review, and have already bought the full frame 5D.  The 7D allows you to use some of the less expensive EF-S lenses, which is probably the biggest selling point, but also possibly the biggest negative.  Two popular EF-S lenses, the wide angle Canon 10-22mm, and the walk-about Canon 17-55IS are amazing lenses for the price, and I think the the best value lenses available, but they won't work if you ever upgrade to a full frame.Finally, my camera did break after a year and a half (6 months after the warranty expired).  The camera \"crashes\" whenever the pop-up flash is engaged.  I have sent it to Canon, and will update this review to describe my experience with the repair process.Update:  The 7D was repaired by Canon for $220.  It was diagnosed as internal burn damage, which I assume means a circuit board overheated.  It was returned in exactly two weeks, and continues to function normally.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why I chose the 7D over the 60D", "Author": "Timothy B.

To be honest, I am sure that I could take great photos with any of the newer digital cameras on the market.  Due to the nature of what I use my cameras for, I am not what you would call a \"power-user.\"  I don't take high speed bursts and I use my camera on manual the majority of the time.  The reason that I select the 7D over the fine 60D had to do with one, highly subjective feature.  It fits my hands.  I also like the weight and heft of the camera since I use several long and heavy L class lenses and they balance nicely with the body.  In this day of mostly plastic cameras, the 7D body is constructed of magnesium.  That matters to me.I seldom purchase kit lenses, but I have heard good things about the 18-135 and when purchased with the body it seemed like a good value.  I have made a couple of thousand images with it already  and although it is not the finest lens that I have ever used, it is great for everyday shooting, portraits and also for travel.

I decided to go with the 7D and was affraid it may be much camera for me.  How wrong I was!  This camera has lots of functions and nice features, some not even available in pro cameras yet.  I sometimes feel like riding a wild horse!  There are 3 things I am impressed with this camera:  (1) Autofocus, (2) Metering, (3) Controls.  Handling is great even if the camera is heavier than the XSi (not as heavy as a pro model).  Some people complain about autofocus.  My advise is to read the manual, buy a 7D specific book like Davi Bush's guide and search online for Canon workshops on 7D and EOS autofocus (Rudy Winston's workshops are excellent!).  I got great tips on configuring my buttons to help with moving focus points, display focus points and grids and it made such a difference!  I couldn't afford a higher end lense until a month ago.  I was using my old XSi kit lenses and I was having a lot of fun. Pictures were great.  After I sold my old camera I finally saved some money and bought the Canon 17-55 f2.8 to pair with the camera.  What a fantastic pair!  heavier and bulkier (I have small hands) but such a joy.  Sharp, fast and amazing at low light. If you have the money, splurge.  My weakness is metering, I am such a kluts!

I'll review both separately to explain the pros and cons of each side of the camera.Stills:Pros:-Awesome ISO range and low noise-Great autofocus (really, really fast)-Frame rate is ridiculous-18mp is wonderful. Great detail.-Custom Picture Styles are extremely satisfying.Considering I'm more of a video person than a photographer, I've really come to appreciate the stills this camera produces. They are clear, even in horrible lighting conditions. Even photos taken in ISO 3200 have very little noise.I shoot in Manual mode, but when I need to get photos taken in a quick second, I find myself flipping it to Green Box mode and clicking on auto focus and firing off a few frames within a few seconds. The photos are awesome. Considering I photograph events, this has saved me a few times.I bought the camera body only so I can use the extra money for a 3rd party lens, the Tamron 17-50 F/2.8. Its a great lens, but the range is clearly designed for \"walking around\" which I do, but when I am a good distance away, the 50mm end of the range is usually not close enough, and not sharp enough.I do have to say, for a semi-pro camera, the still side of the camera is the highlight. There are very little things to complain about. If you have the lenses you need, this camera will make those lenses create wonderful images.Now for the cons: Video.Video:Pros:-1080p resolution/ 720p at 60fps.-Manual controls during shooting.-Compact body and weather sealedCons:-Rolling shutterRolling shutter is when the camera takes a frame by \"rolling\" the scan lines of the CMOS sensor downwards instead of exposing the sensor all at once (called \"global exposure\"). This is especially obvious in high action scenes and flashing lights. Shooting at 720 at 60fps, it is reduced, but it is still evident, especially in a moving car and looking at tall objects like trees and poles (they appear to lean). This camera is best used in low action scenes with a stabilizer like a tripod or shoulder mount (which kind of defeats the purpose of having a portable camera).-Chroma samplingI understand that some of the readers wont know what this is. But for the film people who are considering buying this camera, this is for you.The sampling ratio is 4:2:0. Which isnt prime for green screen. But another side effect is color grading is affected by this. It creates unsightly artifacts in the footage. There are tutorials online on how to upload custom picture styles to greatly increase the dynamic range of the camera (and custom Picture Styles to create amazing colors in the camera), but there is one more thing that affects the footage: Noise.-Noise ReductionThe noise reduction in video is no where near as good as the picture side of the camera. Considering that some might not have the best light available, they'll have to boost the ISO, and once it peaks past 1000iso, the noise becomes more evident. Canon markets this camera as a monster in low light situations (which it is), but the noise is very painful to see, especially when the footage is mixed with HVX-200 footage. The difference is obvious.So, since a good portion of buyers will not really care for the video, most of my cons are irrelevant. It'll be a wonderful camera for the birthday clips and holidays. But for people who want to buy this (or the 5D) for film production (as I did), the limitations should be considered.It is a good camera for dramatic films with little to no action. But, action is a difficult thing to capture on this camera without it looking gelatinous.Overall, its a great camera. Actually, this is a wonderful camera. It is limited in the video side, but for a $1700, it offers a relatively inexpensive high definition capability (most film quality HD camcorders are $3000+ and they have inadequate lenses) and a great \"equalizer\" for film students or indie film productions.For an example as to how the camera deals with concert areas, I have this video I made. Look at the strange lines created in the flashing lights.

Flask", "ReviewID": "R2HZCA8Q9Z0HY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using the 7D for about six months now, and while there are plenty of reviews I thought I'd add a couple of thoughts.  I was coming from a T1i, with which I had been shooting RAW, and not doing much (competent) post processing on the files.  The IQ results were good, and I primarily upgraded to the 7D for the better AF system, the weather sealing and better high ISO performance.The first thing I noticed as far as IQ was concerned is that the raw files looked, well, disappointing.  There seemed to be a lot more luminance noise than the T1i files, and the images seemed mushy and grainy.  I was concerned, but convinced myself that there was no way an upgrade like this could have worse IQ, and figured I had to be doing something wrong.  This went on for a while, and despite my fiddling in Lightroom I wasn't getting the results I felt the camera should deliver.  Then I started to actually learning how to do post-processing of RAW files properly, and the results I got improved dramatically.  The point of this story is that if you're shooting in RAW and coming from something like the T1i, you may find that the images require more detailed post processing than you're used to.  And if you aren't particularly good at post processing, you're going to have to get good at it if you're shooting in RAW.  I can't speak to the quality of the JPG output directly from the camera, as I have not used it at all.((Edit 5/25/11:  As I dig deeper into post-processing the RAW files from the 7D I have a bit of advice for those who will have to step up their post-processing game:  Learn to create presets in Lightroom (or whatever program you are using) that you can apply to common camera settings.  For instance, I can create a preset in Lightroom called \"7D ISO 3200 Dark\" that contains the noise reduction settings I commonly need when post-processing a RAW file shot at ISO 3200 in dark conditions.  Then I can apply this preset across the board to a batch of ISO 3200 files with one click - no more adjusting images individually, no more remembering what settings work best. (You can always tweak things more if needed.)  You can also setup the camera profile in Lightroom to apply these settings automatically upon import, if you wish.  Hopefully this tangent is helpful to people like myself who were finding it difficult to keep up with required post-production work on the 7D's RAW files.  The 7D RAW files force you to learn proper workflow, unless you have a lot of time to kill, or always shoot at ISO 100 in perfect conditions!))The AF system is great, can be tweaked in many ways to suit your needs, and really isn't that hard to learn if you read the manual and play with it for a while.  (Seriously, read the manual.  Twice.)  It's built like a tank, and is very comfortable to hold.  Weather sealing seems good - I've shot with it out in the rain with no cover and no issues.  Just take a little compressed air and blow all the water off when you're done.  Almost all the buttons on the camera can be reconfigured, should you wish to do so.  For instance I've always found the DoF preview button not terribly helpful, so I changed it to be a toggle between One Shot and AI Servo AF modes.  (Good for when you're shooting stills and then you want to switch to action without pressing several buttons/turning dials.)  The C1, C2 & C3 modes are also great for saving exact camera configurations for frequently encountered shooting circumstances.  (Whatever they may be, depending on the individual.)I would caution against purchasing this camera for high ISO purposes.  While the noise can be tamed in post processing, you're not going to be blown away by the quality.  (Unless your current camera is 5 years old.)  If high ISO is the most important thing in the world to you, save up for a 5D MkII (or III if it ever comes out).  You may also want to hold the camera to see if you're going to be comfortable with the size and weight.  (I think it's great, others may find it to be a bit of a beast.)  Finally, with a million options/settings/customizations/buttons, make sure you want a camera with all this functionality (and corresponding complexity).  If you're just going to set it on full auto, your money could probably be better spent elsewhere.  (And you may save yourself some frustration.)So overall a very nice piece of equipment, with a very rich feature set.Edit 5/25/11:The ability to trigger off-camera flash is fantastic.  This opens up a whole new confusing world of lighting to learn, but you can do some really cool things.Also worth mentioning are two other things that I really like about this camera:First, I find the light meter to be great.  Unless conditions are particularly difficult the camera does an excellent job, and I often find myself surprised that it handled the metering of a particular situation as well as it did.  I've actually turned off automatic review on the LCD at this point.  I take a shot of a scene, check it to make sure I don't need any major adjustments, and then just shoot.  Worry about reviewing things later.Second, I almost never take this thing off auto white balance.  I know some reviews have mentioned that AWB isn't great on the 7D, particularly under tungsten lighting.  I haven't found this to be the case - in fact sometimes I change the WB to suit the conditions and find the results are actually worse than what I was getting on AWB.  So I leave it there, and can tweak the WB easily in post if necessary.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Canon to Graduate Up To", "Author": "Kenneth G.

Having used the Rebel for several years, I was hooked on digital photography, but frustrated by my camera's limitations (one-shot at a time with several seconds between shots, and only 6MP sensor).  My Daughter-in-Law's dad is a semi-professional (he actually makes money with his nature pictures) and one day a about a year ago, I had the opportunity to shoot some pictures using his Canon 40D.  That's when I got the bug to upgrade to a more capable camera.  I spent a few months researching the capabilities of different cameras - mainly Canon.  I went back and forth on whether to go for a full-frame or spend less on a crop-frame.  I decided a crop frame would probably serve my needs just fine and I could get more bells and whistles in a crop-frame for a lot less money.I ended up buying a 1 year old 7D with the kit lens for $1000.  Now that I've had it for close to a year, I can honestly say it was the best $1000 I've ever spent!  The capabilities of this camera are amazing!  I also recently bought the Canon 70-200mm F4 L series lens (non-IS) and double-wow!  I took this combination to the BMX International bike competition up at Angel Fire, New Mexico (hosted by RedBull) this past August.  I took over 1300 pictures, using the 8-frames per second capability quite a lot!  Man did I get some great stop-action pictures!I know this isn't as technical a review as some, but I just wanted to give my impressions of this camera!  I would definitely recommend the 7D to anyone who wants an extremely capable camera and can live without full-frame.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 7D - A winner camera", "Author": "Frank", "ReviewID": "R1KVH924I4UZ00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used the Canon EOS 7D almost exclusively for over 5 years now.  The reasons why I selected it still hold true for me:  burst rate, picture quality, professional look and feel, after market accessories available at reasonable prices, lens choices and on-board flash.  Yes, that little flash has given me shots that would not have happened otherwise.  The compromise was supposed to be the sensor size (not full frame).  The latter has not been an issue for me, as evidenced by the large scale quality prints I have produced.  To see some of the damage I\u2019ve done with this machine, please visit my web site at [...]For my time of ownership I have produced a great variety of high quality images that include 24 x 36 in.  posters and long panoramas.  The sensor size (APS-C) has not been an issue for me at all.  This is also due to the magic of post-production.  Additionally, for my needs, I no longer use RAW, but exclusively JPG.On burst-rate:  Originally I used this for high-speed sequencing (such as a skateboarder jumping or a dancer across a dance floor) and for HDR production.  I no longer use this for HDR, since I find it more productive to use 1 high-quality image and curves to produce HDR.  I still use to stack images and produce a flowing effect (such as a waterfall), but not shooting at high speed.  This is useful for me since I wouldn\u2019t need to carry a tripod for this type of shot.Picture quality has been exceptional.  Most of my prints are between 8x10 to 18x24 inches.  As mentioned above, I also have produced bigger prints to include big panoramas.  I have upgraded my lens quality through the years and that has made a difference in quality.  But the sensor size of the 7D has not been an issue.Weight and feel:  This camera is not light, especially with dual battery grip.  However, it is not cumbersome.  It feels solid.  This is due to its magnesium skeleton.  Additionally, with the right lens it provides enough resistance and feedback on hand to produce unique movie shots.  I prefer the Tokina 11 \u2013 16, 2.8 wide angle for this.Notes on Canon APS-C sensor:  Provides extra zoom due to the crop size (1.6X).  The down side is the wide angle end of it.  So if you have a 30mm lens, you really are shooting at 30X1.6= 48mm focal length.  Alternatively, if you have a zoom of, say, 150; you are effectively shooting at 240mm.  With the Tokina lens mentioned, I get very nice wide shots and wide movie angles, without going into the fisheye world.  Particularly satisfying to me is to pan (hand held) to produce the unreal perspective shift this wide angle produces.The original Canon battery is still strong after 5 years.  However, I\u2019ve experimented with Opteka brand and, although they need replacing more often, it allows me to \u2018dollar-cost average\u2019 my battery purchases better.  I make sure I have enough spares.  With the cost of the Opteka (or Power 2000) batteries, this is very reasonable.The low-light performance is really a matter of the lens used.  The camera does not seem to hinder any lens performance.  It accepts EF and EF-S (for Canon cropped sensors, such as the 7D) mounts.My favorite things about the 7D:  How compliant it behaves when you press the shutter, the quality of the shots, and the sound it makes is which is very pleasant.My least favorite:  Movie making must be monitored using the LCD screen only.  I\u2019d rather use the viewfinder.  I primarily use a Panasonic cinema camera for movies, but the 7D for B-shots (supporting shots).In my opinion, this is a regal machine that I have appreciated through the years.

I purchased the camera with the 28-135 mm kit lens, my experience with this lens is as follows...it takes excellent photos (high quality) in situations where you have good ongoing natural light (outdoors especially) and it is just okay in \"low light scenarios.\" I did a wedding with the kit lens and was not impressed by the results (no I was not the hired photographer). However, after researching and renting some high quality lens from the local camera store, I came across an affordable lens that is a must have! My budget was limited so a 2.8L zoom (2k plus) was out of the question. But the 50 mm prime f1.4 was just under $400 and it is awesome on the 7D!!!  I've taken some money shots with the kit lens that have gained the attention of some hard critics however, the 50 mm lens is golden! my shots now are out of this world. I was able to do a recent birthday party (low light) some with flash / some without and the pictures are gorgeous, especially the colors and clarity...wow. Note: The 50 mm lens is soft wide open but from 2.8 & up its tack sharp but you must ensure your focus points are on the subjects eye, and you move closer to / further away to get the optimal depth of field, and the bokeh is absolutely beautiful...trust me you will not be disappointed. I am so glad Canon made this affordable lens.. Oh another tip - if your subjects are moving (even slightly) i found it better to set the camera to AI Servo and just take the shots, my percentage of keepers are now about 85%, and they are the ones I keep reviewing over and over, because I just can't believe I actually took them (but I read and did my homework).While I'm new to digital photography, I have been in the graphics business for over 10 years, so I know beautiful pictures when I see them. I have had this camera for 1 month and have taken at least 1k pictures in every setting the camera has, and the results continue to get better.I now shoot in raw with manual settings just changing the apenture, ISO, and shutter speed, Tv & Av work well with manual adjustments, and the pictures are absolutely gorgeous!!! I have taken family portraits, tried it out at a wedding, and got some really nice shots of wildlife down in Annapolis.What is most impressive about the camera is the continuous shooting at 8 FPS, I took 5 shots of my wife running into the room before she even knew what I was doing (too funny).

Other reviewers have discussed at length the features, functions and so forth.  I'll address what I think are critical points when considering such a camera.Aimed squarely at the prosumer market, the 7D offers professional level ability while keeping the operation simple and allowing the user to adjust the complexity up as their talents and skills develop.It should be said that a camera doesn't make a photographer, but a quality camera can make a good photographer better.  If you're spending up for this camera body, do yourself a favor and save some money for a good quality \"L\" lens, a good quality tripod (expect to spend from $700-$1500) and maybe some training.  The capabilities of this camera far exceed most casual to amateur photographers, so spend some time learning the art of photography and you'll get many years of great memories out of this camera.In shooting thousands of photos with this camera, I've found a few tips that are worth mentioning.  As with any electronic equipment, there are native resolutions and calculated resolutions.  If you stick to ISO settings on multiples of ISO 160, you'll find the images less noisy and much clearer.  This is because the native ISO settings are on or nearest to a factor of 160.  ie: 160, 320, 480, 640, 800, 1250, 2400, 5000.  Use a high quality lens, use a high quality CF card, and use high quality imaging editing software.

I'm certain you've already asked yourself about the specs, decided on price point, and are a semi-serious ameture to budding professional in the market if you're looking at this camera.Let me start with the word value.  Speaking purely from a consumer standpoint, I'm rather keen on focusing on getting the most from a product for an overall value perspective.  The 7D offers it's users just that.  At (roughly) a $1,600, there isn't a camera on the market that meets this cameras overall ability (within the space for which it was designed) to deliver stunning photographs time after time.A cropped sensor comes with it's own benefits and costs relative to a full frame sensor so I would suggest that you ensure that you do your homework when considering your needs.  I'll give you a very quick rundown of the strengths of each sensor type to help guide you along:Full Frame Advantage:-Viewfinder (Although the 7D is 100% coverage!)-Angle of View: Wide Angle-Shallow Depth of Field-Image Quality-ISO Performance | Low Light (7D is very usable up to about 800)Cropped Sensor Advantage:-Focus Area | Auto-Focus Systems (Smaller senors = more AF point coverage!)A breif bit on this.  The 7D for a camera in this particular space is BEST IN BREED with 19 CROSSTYPE AF points.  This is BY FAR my favorite part of the camera.  Coverage is wonderful and it locks onto your subject with razor precision!-Angle of View: Telephoto (Wildlife, Sports photography!)-Great Depth of Field-Value & AffordabilityPlease review the above to help you make your choices when reviewing the 5D vs 7D series cameras.The 7D is extremely well built and handles like a dream.  The construction, molding, weather sealing components scream quality and for the price point, you aren't going to obtain a better value for your dollar!  VALUE VALUE VALUE!That being said, for MY personal shooting needs, I am eagerly anticipating the release of the Canon 5D Mark III because portrait work is my area of focus.  That isn't to say however that the 7D will not perform admirably for you when shooting portraits, it's just that I'm starting to outgrow it's limitations relative to portrait photography.  The current 5D series does in fact offer better image quality and low light performance which is becoming more and more a requirement for my personal style.All things considered though, the 7D it is an absolute classic camera! It has been the pillar of my kit and has become an extension of my vision.  I can rely on it...and enjoy using it.

My last camera was in my back pocket when I was in Central America this past winter and I broke it. That was the last straw and my wife told me to get a larger camera so I won't loose/wreak more cameras.After researching I decided to get a DSLR. I hadn't used a SLR since the 70s so I was a little intimidated by the selection and features. I wanted a camera that would last me a long time and that I wouldn't have to upgrade when I got better at taking pictures.

I can't say that I was overwhelmed by the quality of the images on the 7D but they are outstanding.  If your primary concern is image quality, it seems to me you could buy a 50D or 60D and spend the extra money on quality Canon lenses and your images would rival the 7D.  The features that sold me on the 7D however were the wireless flash control (finally!); the weather sealing; shutter durability; large, crystal clear LCD; and 8 fps.  Professional grade stuff for a \"prosumer\" camera.  Also great is the RAW/JPG button and the Q button which is great for changing settings FAST without scrolling through tons of menus (which all pro photogs can appreciate).  At ISO 1600, images are still acceptable in my opinion.  If you shoot mostly still photos like I do, the HD video was not that important but it is very impressive what cinematographers are doing with this DSLR.  There's plenty of sample videos to watch and I'm excited to try this camera out on my occasional film projects that I produce for weddings and other special events.  I wish they included the NTSC DV resolution (720x480) so the footage would match my miniDV camera, especially because the HD video takes enormous amounts of hard drive space.

So I have some experience with cameras, lenses, and editing software.We got this because we wanted a new camera to make commercials with. We wanted to shoot in HD (the 1080 kind, not the 720), but we didn't want a $30,000 rig - no way I could convince the big boss to do that since making commercials is a secondary, even tertiary, function of the company I work for.For a cinematic look we chose the 7D. For what we wanted, and expected, and what we got, I rate the camera 5 stars. But that's because I also know the limitations of the camera. You won't take this camera and treat it like it's a prosumer or professional HD videocamera that you would take if you where the videographer for COPS. You won't take this to capture video on a running, fast-paced, nighttime fugitive hunt. In low light settings, or settings where you can't control the light, you will get motion blur. In high lighted areas, if you don't have a rig setup with an eye piece half the time you won't be able to see the screen with enough clarity to know if you're subject is in focus or not (if you're using a very slim depth of field, like on a f2.8 or faster lens).Obviously, for about the same price, we could have gotten a prosumer or low, low professional grade HD videocamera that would have had better autofocus, less motion blur on action, etc. But the trade off on that is lower low-light capacity for shooting, and lower contrast levels, overall less picture quality and less control of depth of field.I recommend this camera if you want to take HD video and make a basket of apples look sexy.

I decided to skip a generation (the 60D) and go for the 7D instead. So glad I did! At first it took a little bit of getting used to but once you figure it out (which is easy if you already had a Canon) it actually makes life so much easier. Here are some examples -1. Selecting AF points is a breeze using the joystick. It was time consuming on the T2i and I rarely did it. This change alone has improved the amount of in focus shots ten fold I reckon.2. The LED display on the top means I never even look at the LCD screens menu settings. T2i required you to press quick jump then scroll around in there until you find what you need.3. The scrolling wheel instead of the arrows makes changing aperture easy work.Of course all pro Camera's have these kind of time saving things but those camera's cost a small fortune. I did have a moments thought when I was considering the 5D Mk II, but then I would of had to sell my 10-22, which I adore! Since I didn't want to use the kit lens from my T2i (which would not be doing this camera justice) or end up with yet another kit lens I got the body only and paired it up with the awesome 17-55mm f/2.8, together they are an awesome combination! I highly recommend it.Now back to the camera, here's a long list of pros.- Lightning fast 8fps, even if you don't shoot sports you might need it if you're in a bind and need that crucial shot to be sharp.- Performs amazingly well at high ISO; I got usable shots at ISO 1600 and even 3200. With minimal Noise reduction in Lightroom.- 19 cross type AF points, with different modes including a precision mode makes focusing so much easier. Less headaches and frustration.- Three programmable custom modes in addition to the Av, Tv M and P means, for example you could set up one for HDR or another for sports and then you're just a dial away from getting to the correct shooting mode.- Built in master flash wireless transmitter. An awesome feature means you can, indoors at least, get away without using expensive radio triggers. Tried it and it works really well, though if you are gonna get serious about off camera flash you might want to invest in other ways to trigger it. Great for learning though.- Dedicated button for video / live view mode. This is a very handy feature. sometimes I'm taking pictures and I see something I wanna video and by the time I had changed the T2i to video, it was all over.- Weather sealed. And apparently quite well too. I read a Canon rep mention that it was better than the 5D MkII in this respect.- Buttons feel nice, not like the 60D's squijy things. These feel more satisfying. A small thing but things like that annoy me!- Show off to your friends with the electronic leveling gizmo. Looks like something out of Top Gun. Seriously cool (though I've never used it!)- Dedicated picture style button. This is a very smart idea. I always forget to change my pic style, at least now I have no excuse!- The hand grip feels nice, I tried the 60D and it felt, for want of a better word - ikky.- Boasts the shortest name for a Canon camera currently in use, just rolls of the tongue. The T2i (550D??) had an identity crises. Mine was called a Kiss x4 and that plagued my dear mind endlessly! (Why the Japanese chose 'Kiss' over 'Rebel' I have no idea!!)Ok there are loads of pros and now the cons- It's not a 5D Mk III (and consequently not full frame). I am starting to doubt myself and all this 5D hype recently is making me jealous!But seriously, the only reason not to get it is if you want to skip from Rebels to full frame in which case good for you for a) being rich and b) becoming an overnight pro!

Even if I move to full frame one day, I'd still keep this as my 'back-up' camera.Verdict - Get it and get some decent lenses, heck splash out on L lenses and enjoy the good times.

Prior to buying, I spent a fair amount of time researching the pros and cons of shooting video with DSLRs in general, and specifically as it relates to the 7D.Initially what I had read about the \"rolling shutter\" issue with DSLRs had me concerned.  Essentially the shutter is held open and the image from the lens is recorded off the sensor in a vertical linear fasion.  (ie. in \"rows\")  In fast-moving subjects, or if the camera is panned too quickly, this can yield a \"jello\" effect.  For instance, a fast pan of a tall building could cause the building to appear more diagonal than vertical.Thus far, I've had no noticeable issues with rolling shutter.  The nature of careful shooting at 24fps (ie. being mindful of panning speeds to avoid jarring/judder, etc.) helps greatly here.Prior to the 7D, I was using a Canon VIXIA HF100 as my main camera, attached to a 35mm depth-of-field adapter.  We still use the Vixia as our handy \"home movie\" camera (It is, afterall, a nice camera!).  However, after using the Canon EOS 7D, I don't think I could ever go back to a standard video camera - or any camera that involves a depth-of-field adapter - for short film shooting.Here are the reasons: - No need to flip the video (in the case of 35mm DOF adapters) - Wide array of lenses to choose from.  (I use my old M42/Pentax lenses + $12 EOS adapter.) - Convenient video codec (H.264 .MOV file... drops right into most any NLE) - Extreme low-light capability (Wide ISO range can be adjusted quickly) ...great for natural or available-light shooting. - Totally customizable (more below)Starting with my older Canon GL2, I've had a habit with every camera I've owned... that is, I dial the sharpness all the way down (no electronic enhancing) and also knock the saturation down a bit.  This tends to give a bit more lattitude in post for color correcting.  While the Canon EOS 7D has a LOT of menu options, I was able to figure this out after spending 15 minutes or so flipping through the menus.  I now have C1 on my dial set for 1920x1080 24p, 1/50 shutter, no sharpening, low contrast, and a few other features either enabled or disabled.  I also have the ISO defaulted to around 200, but this can be quickly changed while shooting, via a button on the top-right and selecting the ISO from the list.Audio recording is an area I read as a drawback to the camera, but I capture all sound wild so it wasn't a big deal in my case.  For those requiring quality audio on-camera a quality shotgun mic could help.Being so small... you'll definitely want to add something to this camera to get a bigger form-factor.  I've read great things about the Z-Finders but I don't have one yet as they are quite expensive.  They can greatly aid in focusing, particularly in bright outdoor shoots, and they give that extra point of contact against your eye for stability.  I'm using the IndiFocus setup I'd used previously with the Vixia.  Generally speaking, bulking the camera up really improves shots and prevents the jittery look you may get when shooting with a DSLR alone.  I find the camera's LCD display to be sufficient for focusing.  (One other nice feature:  Just prior to shooting, you can hit the zoom/magnifier to ensure your subject is in tack-focus before pressing record.)I'm researching variable ND (neutral density) filters, as one of those is a must for bright outdoor shooting, in cases where you want to maintain the shallow depth of field but not crank up the shutter speed and get that stacatto freeze-frame appearance.  Standard NDs can be used as well, but it would likely require a set of them to stack on and remove as needed, which in my opinion wouldn't be as preferable as a single adjustable filter.At any rate, the camera itself is just fantastic.  I really can't say enough good things about it for its video capability.  It's a pleasure to use, gives total control over the look, and captures stunning HD footage!", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon's Newest Crop SLR Packs a Powerful Punch", "Author": "Ms_Ladi \"...just wandering the world.\"", "ReviewID": "RSD2Y1J5ELV1C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Canon 7D for about two weeks now and after about a thousand shots:Introduction.  A very impressive high megapixel count for Canon's new professional/consumer digital SLR, but keep in mind that, as you approach higher resolutions, you need to ensure the lens on the SLR can resolve that much detail. Being that I only purchased the body, I'll be anxious to see how the lens kit fairs with this new camera.  The shots I've seen so far across the internet are impressive, however. The lens I've used with this camera so far is my Canon 24-70 f/2.8L.  A huge jump in ISO performance over my XSi, but that's to be expected.  I'm having troubles with focusing, but I'll touch on that in a minute.Image Quality.  Outstanding. Perfect Colors in comparison to my Canon G10 and XSi.  No color banding, excellent sharpness.ISO. Canon 7D's ISO performance is great for the amateur photographer attempting to get great photos (and the semi-pros who know what their doing...I'm the former).  As I said previously, I had the opportunity to take photos in a restaurant at about the same time using the same lens with both the XSi and the 7D (different days).  The difference in quality and keeper rate was amazing!  I am one that will stop shooting at a higher ISO once the grain starts showing more predominantly, but at an ISO3200, I found pretty nice photos in a barely lit restaurant. The LCD screen is the same as the Canon 5D Mark II (3\", 920K Pixels), clear and fully visible even in bright sunlight. In comparison, the Canon XSi SLR  also has a 3\" LCD, but with 230,000 pixels.Size/Build. This build of the camera is substantially well made.  It's supposed to be made of a magnesium body and weather proof.  Either way, I have no fears of taking this camera out in the elements.  It's more substantial than the XSi, and after only a few hours of shooting with the 7D, picking up the XSi felt like a children's toy.  I have small hands (ms_ladi hands), but still have no problems carrying the 7D body with the 24-70 lens.Video. I am not interested whatsoever in the video aspect of SLR cameras and can never understand why this feature is included.  Well, yes I can understand.  I tried out the video for a few minutes and here are a couple of things I did not like.  I also searched a few forums and found a couple of the same opinions.  When I start shooting, I have to focus prior to shooting, but if I pan somewhere else, the camera won't autofocus again--just manual. Also, while I was taking snapshots during shooting, the video paused and the sound of the picture taking was heard.  Since I'm not a fan of shooting on cameras, I'm not sure this is normal.  The playback, however, is pretty amazing...lifelike, very realistic colors.Autofocusing.  Canon's new 7D packs 19 AF points.  It looks like Canon will be releasing a new firmware that might update their AF feature, however mine works fine.  I was able to confer with a Canon rep who referred me to various other features on the camera that lets Autofocus really shine through.  All points are covered.Conclusion. For the price, the new Canon 7D is the most excellent camera that Canon has released.  For the amateur like myself, by itself or coupled with a Canon G10 for the \"low-pro\" times, one has a one-two power combination.  For the semi-pro, this is the probably the best crop to date.

So far I am VERY happy with this camera's ability to do still work.  My objections come with it's audio feature for hd recording.  Though I haven't fully tested it yet as I'm waiting on some proper cf cards, I have been able to experiment with the audio, and it's mind boggling execution.  Coming from a video background I have really good mics, and fully expected to be able to use them since the camera has an audio input.  However, even feeding a signal from a pro quality field mixer with high end pro mics the sound is plain lousy.  Reason is the camera has a built in agc (audio gain control), and so it tries to constantly adjust the level of the sound coming in.  Also I think the input itself is of an unbelievably bad quality (as in totally unusable).  Now that I have the camera I've discovered all these forums and pretty much the only solution is to buy a separate recording device, record separate audio and video and then sync them up in your video editing system.  I couldn't believe this to be the case and so I called Canon support.  To say they were less the helpful would be an understatement.  Their customer service reps are just armed with very basic knowledge and not much help.

My dad has always been a camera nut, and thus, I became one too. While I would never say any of my old models were \"pro\" (mostly old Minolta models), they were still an SLR, and as a result, they were a great lesson on photography growing up. As I got older, I became interested in filmmaking and purchased a Panasonic DVX100 video camera, which was a fantastic piece of equipment. I held on to it for about 4 years, and did many projects with it.NOW, when I first heard all the business about DSLRs and video modes, I scoffed. I instantly thought about the video mode on my crummy old point and shoot, which is, in so many words, awful. Then I saw footage. Incredible! It took me a while to be completely sold, but eventually I was ready to sell my beloved DVX to purchase a DSLR. I finally, after much debate (mostly between the 7d and the GH1), I settled on the Canon 7d.This camera is great. I've been wanting to get back into still photography again, and this is my first DSLR, so I'm excited for that, on top of the video mode. Both have performed to my expectations, sometimes beyond. The body feels extremely rugged, and the weight makes you realize it's not some cheapy plastic. I guess the easiest way to not make this review 10 pages would be a pro and con list, so here we go:PROS:-Feels very rugged, yet comfortable. I'm not so paranoid about having it out in scenarios that would have made me nervous with my DVX-Still quality is great-Auto-focus seems good, but I've really never taken much to auto-focus, so I'm probably not the best authority to talk on this. It's very fast, but I prefer manual control in most situations.-Live view is great in still and video mode. The zoom function is something that I've found invaluable for focusing.-HD video is amazing. Moving from SD to HD was a huge bump from the DVX, and I love the quality, sharpness, and detail. Dynamic range is much nicer than the DVX as well.-Battery life is better than expected-Didn't buy the kit lens, but the Canon 50mm 1.4 works great on this body and delivers wonderful results.CONS-As I mentioned, I've used SLRs before, and tinkered with some other DSLRs before, so the learning curve for me was mostly finding what settings are where, but I can see the learning curve being fairly steep for a complete new comer.-Anyone interested in the video mode who has done even a small bit of research knows of some of the limitaons of the camera (rolling shutter, \"jello\" effect, etc). These are annoyances, but something I'm willing to put up with considering the overall quality and price point-Photography, as I tend to forget from time to time, is an EXPENSIVE hobby. Lenses, battery grips, stabilization systems (for video), tripods, etc. The costs DO add up, so make sure you're committed to the craft before you get started, otherwise you'll be disappointed how quickly you can pour money into this stuff (I assume most people realize this, but always good to mention, even though it's not at all specific to the 7d).Well, I think that's more or less it. I love the camera so far and have no regrets about my purchase. Look forward to using it on some upcoming projects!", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid APS-C Performer", "Author": "P. VANDALEN", "ReviewID": "R1MFY0Y5P35UOJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had reached the limitations of my beloved Pentax K20 for the type of picture shooting I do, and I didn't find what I was looking for in the new Pentax K-7.  I needed fast and accurate auto focus performance in all lighting conditions and exceptional low-light, high ISO performance.  The 7D came out at just the right time.  I had considered the Nikon D300, but I preferred Canon L lens choices and the lesser relative cost for the ones I was interested in.  It was costly to switch to Canon and buy all new lenses, but with the 7D it was certainly worth it!All the positives have been repeated over and over.  I can't add anything new.  My point of reference for the performance of the 7D was the Pentax K20 and K-7 (briefly).  In comparison, the 7D is at least twice as fast in acquiring focus lock in medium to low light situations.  Focus accuracy has been excellent once you master how to properly use the various focus modes.  I am getting shots now I could never possibly get before with the Pentax in those situations of immediate-shot, candid pictures and moving subjects.  Additionally, the excellent high-ISO performance allows me to shoot at ISO 3200 to 5000+ without issue, giving me more flexibility with higher f-stops and shutter speeds, helpful in low-light situations and with lenses that don't have image stabilization (17-40 f4L, 24-70 f2.8L, 70-200 f4L).  While exposure control has worked very well, I have noticed a tendency to slightly overexpose most of the time.  Some have commented on the shutter sound.  I recall the Pentax K-7 has a quiet shutter sound which I found a BIG plus for shooting inconspicuous candids.  The 7D also has a very quiet shutter but with an unusual sound - sort of like a coil spring snapping on what would be an extremely expensive toy dart gun.  I got used to it and at times depend on the stealth qualities to shoot unnoticed.However, there are few must-haves in my mind, essential for the next upgrade of the camera.Cons:The biggest issue I have with the 7D is the fact that the mode dial is constantly changing setting from what I last left it.  Part of the problem is that the power switch is now located right next to it.  Quickly turning the power on or off may cause the mode dial to be changed.  Since I often shoot spontaneously from \"the hip\" while the camera strap is slung over my shoulder, I recently found out that the strap itself can rub across the mode dial and move it to another setting.  Not good if you are doing sudden, \"get the shot now!\" shooting.  The cure is simple: do like the Pentax K-7 and use a lock button in the middle of the dial.  Problem solved. Of course, any photographer on top of their game knows what the camera settings are every time they press the shutter button (note to self).The other irritant I have is with the CF card door. It's large and slides backwards to open, thereby having the back end of it along the side of the body right where you put the most pressure from the palm of you hand.  Mount a heavy lens on this camera like the 24-70 f2.8L or the 70-200 f2.8L, and the pressure placed by your hand on the edge of the CF door causes it to flex and squeak.  I heard the 5D has the same issue.  Mine started solid but now is flexing and getting noisy.  I also doubt the integrity of the weather sealing of this cover, referencing back to Pentax for what seemed like better sealing on their high-end bodies.Conclusion:The two issues I mention are hardly deal-breakers.  They can be resolved easily if Canon chooses to do so and can be accounted for by the user's handling/acceptance. I still have a long way to go to get to the point of fully mastering the potential of this camera, but for what I've experienced so far, this is an excellent buy and concedes little if you need an APS-C format camera to shoot professionally. Overall, this is an exceptional camera that has taken my photography to a higher level.Update (4/11/10):Still love the camera.  The problem I was having with the mode dial being turned by the camera strap when slung over the shoulder has been resolved by going to a special strap that connects to the tripod mount at the bottom of the camera and crosses the upper body so that the camera can be quickly drawn upward into shooting position from your side. However, the other issue I have with the camera is getting worse - the loose and squeaking CF door. I remove the CF card to load pictures on my computer, and I do this once a day for the last 4 1/2 months now.  Perhaps I open and close this door more than others which has contributed to the apparent wear. While Canon should repair this issue under warranty, I hate to be without the camera for the several weeks required to send it off and have the work done.  It's unfortunate that this little piece of plastic can so undermine the structural integrity of what is otherwise a very solid camera.Update (10/17/10):While the mode dial is still an issue, after a year of use I've noticed that other parts of the camera body are flexing and making noise, such as the area near the battery door.  Could try more gaffer tape as used on the CF door to stop the problem.  However, the showstopper issue I just encountered was while on a once-in-a-lifetime vacation; the camera started to fail with an ERR 20 condition in which the shutter would not function for that one shot. Luckily, this only happens about 5% of the time, so the camera can still be used, but it can't be relied upon until sent in for repair.  Hopefully, this and the loose body issues can be fixed at the same time.Update (12/26/10:The camera has been sent back to Canon twice to fix the Err 20 problem with two completely different things \"fixed\" each time, but still the Err 20 appears for 5% to 20% of my shots.  Requested a new camera, but Canon said they need to look at it a third time.

The fist year I shot with a Canon Rebel T2i (AKA 550D)  The image quality was good on this camera but the speed was lacking.What I didn't realize until I got the 7D was how much the speed was lacking.  The T2i is a great camera in it's own right and for consumers it's very good.  When I bought it I thought, hey it has virtually the same sensor as the 7D this should be good enough.Well, I had no idea how much difference the 19 cross type AF points would make, or how much faster 8 FPS was.  My keeper rate went up immediately.  Now, I realize there are other features I could mention, like the  7D is able to control off camera flashes without the use of a 500 series flash,  but really the reason to buy this camera is speed.  This is Canon's best crop frame sensor camera body, hands down, nothing else comes close.  For my purposes the cropped sensor is an advantage as it multiplies my effective focal length by 1.6 and ISO performance is not terribly important as I'm shooting in daylight.  But, I've spoken with many other photogs that have the 5D mk2 and mk3 and when they shoot outdoor sports they still use their 7D, it's AF system is just faster, as is it's frame rate and the added low light capability of the 5D is moot at 2pm outside.  Further, I shoot this camera with the double battery Canon vertical grip.  It makes for a big camera.  This fits my hand very well and the whole system feels very rugged and sturdy.  Much more so than the plastic bodied rebel.  If you are to read my other reviews you may be sensing a theme here.  Value.  This body is no exception.It's expensive for the novice and relatively inexpensive relative to other pro bodies but it defintely earns it's xD (single digit D) Canon designation.  It is a true pro body and at $1700 it's still a great deal, just look at how much you have to spend to get a 6D, 5D, or god forbid a 1D, and the 1D series are the first bodies to start to compare in terms of AF performance as the other cameras are more wedding cameras.  For the money, you can't beat the Al Servo performance of this camera.  Of course if money was no object I'd have a 1Dx and all the big boy primes but for me money matters and for my money this camera delivers pro quality.

I use the AF point expansion most of the time (1 point with 1 expansion in each direction).  Some people have indicated they were not happy with the sharpness - I adjusted the sharpness setting up a bit (if you want jpeg) in the standard mode, and it seemed to make a difference.  Also, look around on-line and you will see how people have configured the various C.FN menu options.  I set up the C.FN III Autofocus/Drive menu options after playing around with it and saved it as \"C1\".  AI Servo seems to work well for me with moving kids.  Also, setting up the (*) or other button on the back for metering and focus with your thumb, and the usual shutter release button by your finger.  This may take some getting used to if you haven't done it before.  I have \"M\" set up for usual finger meter/focus, and C1 set up the other way using thumb for back button focus / finger for shutter.  It worked pretty well.

I think the price I paid was a pretty good deal.  I have been using a Rebel xti/400d for about 5 years, and after using the 7d for just a week, it is simply a joy.  The xti has served me well, and I'll keep it as a second with the nifty 50 attached.I considered the 7d, 60d and t4i, or even a used 50d, as well as waiting for the new \"70d\" (whatever it will be called, and whenever it will be released, and most likely at a much higher price, my guess is 1800-2000 with dual digic 5s).The 60d pricing was 799 like the t4i, and then just dropped down to 699 (after I purchased the 7d), so it was priced very attractively.  Used 50d seem to go for mid 500s.  I am not a pro, but enjoy it has a hobby, shoot manual/raw, and like most most people, considered going the route of a lower priced body with another lens, but the L lens I would be considering is more than I wanted to spend now.  I often use the Canon 50 1.4 and 85 1.8 (my favorite) primes and have flash and other lenses that give me good results for my needs, so didn't really feel the need to \"upgrade to L lens first\" given the jump from xti to 7d.As for the 60d, I actually did not want a flip out screen since I see that as a potential damage point as I carry my camera at my side without a strap, and if the kids were to ever get at the 60d, that is the first thing they would play with (and destroy).  If I really need flip out screen/video, a small HD camcorder is much easier to handle compared to a heavy DSLR.  The 7d feels much better ergonomically and durability wise than the 60d and t4i.  As for the t4i, the touchscreen was not a big selling point since, quite frankly, I have enough touchscreen devices with phones and tablets, and I definitely prefer using the 7d wheel and joystick controls - they seem much easier to me, everything is easy to access and where you expect it to be.Other reviews lay out the many technical specs of the 7d vs others noted above including the exceptional autofocus system, dual processors, speed, weather seal, etc.  The firmware update addresses some of the \"cons\" and improves performance as well, and now magic lantern is available for 7d too whereas before it was on the 60d, but not 7d.  The 7d is definitely more complex than the xti I was used to, but after a week of reading the manual and testing it out, the controls are already second nature.All of the cameras above are very good cameras and will probably yield very similar results, and the final decisions may simply come down to preferences for particular features, but I am very satisfied with the 7d.  While the \"latest and greatest\" \"70d\" would be nice, I am not sure I would want to pay the extra $ for it for what I do, particularly if the improvements are nominal.Happy shooting.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "A solid camera with a learning curve", "Author": "tshore", "ReviewID": "RDIOU15PFAU5E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a month ago as an upgrade from my Rebel XSi.  I considered a couple of Nikon models, but wanted to keep compatability with my existing, and growing, Canon glass collection.  I considered the 5D, but decided that for outdoor sports photography, often taken at the long end of 250mm, which has been my main focus, so to speak, that it did not make sense to pay up for a full-frame camera that would also require longer lenses.  So I went with the best APS-C camera Canon offers - the 7D.It is notably larger and heavier than my XSi. Mostly I like the extra heft, but it is a mixed blessing. Certainly the solid feel is nice. Also nice for sports is the 8fps in servo mode,which is gatling-gun fast.  The dual processors also help display images quickly, unlike the long lag in my XSi.This is a high-performance camera for photographers who know at least a bit about what they are doing.  It is not a camera for newbees.  For example, there are no \"sport\" or \"landscape\" modes built in, as there are in the XSi.  There are custom modes, but you need to know something about the camera, and about photography, to create and use them effectively.  This is not a complaint, just something you should understand if you are considering buying this camera.Coming from the XSi, I found the controls took some getting used to.  Even after a couple of months, I still find myself using the quick dial when I need to use the main dial, and vice versa.  And some controls that were easy to access on the XSi, like White Balance, are not quite as easy to access/change on the 7D in some cases.  White balance is a particular gripe. It's displayed in the top LCD, but the icons are too small for me to see well, so I wind up using the main LCD, going through screens, etc.The ability to use ISO settings above 1600 to capture indoor action was a major reason I upgraded, and the 7D does very well on this front, albeit to date I not often needed to venture over 3200.Image quality has been very good, though not notably better than the XSi.  I take mostly action shots rather than portaits or landscapes, so the gating factor in terms of image quality for me is typically the abilty to use a sufficiently fast shutter speed rather than sensor size/resolution.  The higher ISO settings available on the 7D do help in that regard.Improved autofocus was another reason I upgraded from the XSi, and in this regard, the 7D excels.  The ability to select groups of the 19 sensors provides a lot of flexibility for different situations, and the ability to strike a balance between the control offered by single-point autofocus, and the cover of multiple points for those shots where a subject in motion may not be covered by the central point.  My rate of in-focus action shots improved dramatically using the 7D, and now after having used it I would not want to go back to the XSi's 9 widely-spaced sensors for sports shooting.In sum, this camera is very capable, but does not suffer fools gladly.  The question is, is it $1000 more camera than an XSi, or $600 more than a 60D, when $800 more can get you a 5D with a full frame sensor and the image quality and noise reduction improvements that come with that?  For my purposes, I would buy this camera again, and would recommend it to anyone who shoots sports and doesn't have the budget for a 1D.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love the 7D!!!", "Author": "N.

K. Miles \"dkmiles1\"", "ReviewID": "R1ED5NTD4BU00I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying, I love my 7D.  It's the most athletic camera I own - 8 FPS, killer autofocus system, ISO expandable to 12,800, all of the canon lenses - and 3rd party lenses, almost any accessory out there has a canon version.  Some of the best photo's I've taken have been with the 7D.  Not to mention, the cinematic quality of the 1080p video capability in conjunction with all of those said lenses.So why am I a bit let down in the image quality department?  Its very simple, even though the 7D has high ISO capability, I find that cramming 18 MPs on to an APS-C sensor is MP overkill.  I've found that noise levels are more acceptable on my Rebel XSi than my 7D.  At ISO 100, the 7D is awesome, its awesome all the way to 1,000.  However, when I set (and I don't that often) the ISO to auto - the 7D constantly bumps the ISO to 3,200 - the results are some really noisy images.  Granted - Noise Ninja does a great job in post production in reducing noise, but the fact is the 7D is sold as a low light camera - implying excellent low light performance - and the performance IS good (focus, metering, etc) but the resulting images are (in my mind) somewhat disappointing.  So I switch to full manual mode and work with ISO 100 and pretend there's not any other ISO setting and I've been much happier.  I also use f/2.8 and low light primes (85 1.8, 50 1.4, etc.) to take advantage of the 7D's low light capabilities.On the plus side the 7D is simply loaded with features - video, 8FPS, custom settings, doesn't need an additional transmitter to trigger remote speed lites, killer auto focus system, etc, etc, etc.But if your goal is just great image quality, you might consider spending your money on a used first generation 5D.  It takes better pictures.  If you need a more capable camera (with really good image quality) like for sporting events then The 7D is best suited for you.  If you take portraits or families on the beach then get the 5D, and use the left over money to put toward a high quality prime lens.Think of the 7D as an 'athlete' - think if the 5D as an 'artist' - depending on your needs, that's the one to go with...", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Features compared to XT, AF on the soft side", "Author": "Isaac Burdeinick \"iburdeinick\"", "ReviewID": "R2X7G0L45GY45P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Rebel XT (350D) for three going four years, and yes it is a awesome camera!when I was looking for an upgrade to my rebel XT the T1i look really great, but then came the 7D and all of the new AF features and video. I think that the rebel body is lean and small even more now having a XD body.If your on a budget the rebel T1i is a great upgrade with more MP (al dough with 8MP is more than enough) good video Q, live view and better high ISO performance than the XXXD and if you like the rebel series bodies then you should go for it, now if you don't mind the video The 50D offers higher ISO and FPS than the rebel series and better IQ overall.7D !!! :I do recommend the upgrade to any one moving in that direction. The size is no issue when you get all that features, and it feels really good solid and hefty in your hands. The FPS & AF Are Fast. The high ISO performance is amazing comparing it to the XT, the low light focus and results are simply great. The AF points and versatile setup is so much better than the XT there is no comparing it.The view finder and the LCD screen are just awesome... you cannot compare it to the Rebel 350D its on another league.The battery life is longer, you can record RAW a JPG on at the same time or choose to do it with a press of a button. And the list of features goes on.I Think that there is still much potential on the 7D via firmware cos it's a awesome piece of hardware, no matter what they say.18-270mm Tamron VC ( got it last year to upgrade the Rebel and now use with the 7D )50D :I think (money wise) that a Canon 50D is a good upgrade (IQ compared to the 7D) and don't care for the video or faster AF.If you are looking for the most IQ available today, it's no brainer that the 5DMII is the choice (and don't mind the extra money) performs better in low light than the 7D. Now the 7D is faster on Focus and in FPS, so if youre a sports shooter or wildlife photographer the 7D will suit you more.Hope it helps you decideThe AF is not 100% accurate all the time ( got in touch with Canon Tech and they say maybe its because of the Tamron Lens? ) I get a bit soft images that you can improve with PP but overall you get very good IQ ( if want excellent IQ get the 5DMKII )Highly Recommended!", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Canon I have Owned Yet", "Author": "Manny", "ReviewID": "R3HZ9GTUOGIGU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first started reading about this camera I started to get excited, the only thing that bothered me was that it is not a full frame camera. Well I have had it for about 3 weeks and have been putting it through my own test. The picture quality has been fantastic,I don't miss the full frame sensor. The raw files do come out somewhat soft but as soon as you run them through photoshop you get a sharp photo. I edit all my photos in photoshop raw or jpeg, I think if your a serious photographer, you do everything you can to maximize the quality of your images. Some people complain about the file size, yea I hate having more resolution to work with. Kidding of course and anyway you can adjust the size of the files by adjusting the quality of the jpeg or raw file. The jpeg has a 18mp, 8mp, and 4.5mp size the raw has a 18mp, 10mp, and 4.5mp size. So you don't have to shoot at full resolution if you don't need to, I know I don't. I own a 1D Mark3 and have really loved that camera but I like this camera more. The camera is built well it is very nice to hold it in your hands, its lighter than the 1D too. When you pick up the 7D you know your holding something of quality.It is feature rich and has a bit of a learning curve, but I love playing with a new camera so that doesn't bother me. The auto focus and exposure system have both worked well for me, of course I don't expect the camera to do all the work. There are some circumstances where you have to know how to get a right exposure, because all cameras will be fooled in certain situations. As for noise at high ISO I get that with my 1D and every other digital camera I have ever owned. I either use flash or use photoshop to help me live with it. I need to address the 2 Star reviewer who is comparing the 7D's cost with the $900 cheaper canon rebel T2i and ask the question is it worth that much more. I say yes and these are my reasons.First there is no comparison between the build quality of the two. The rebel is made out of plastic and has no weather sealing. Yes the rebel is smaller and lighter that is a plus for him a minus for me. I like something I can hold on to and has a rugged build which the titanium body and weather sealing makes the 7D such a camera. I have shot with it in wet falling snow and rain and had no problems.The 7D shoots at 8fps the rebel at 3.5fps.The 7D has a 19 point autofocus system which has worked very well for me, the rebel has a 9 point autofocus system.The 7D has 27 cudtom functions the rebel has 12The 7D has an electronic level the rebel doesn'tThe 7D has a special macro servo AF mode when you attach a macro lens the rebel doesn'tThe 7D can fire remote flash the rebel needs a remote fireing device to do this.The 7D has duel processors which jumps it to a pro level camera by itself, the rebel has one.The 7D has five different autofocus point, settings the rebel has two.The 7D has a 100% view finder the rebel has 95%.The 7D is rated at 150,000 cycles the rebel is not rated.There are many more features the 7D has,that the rebel doesn't.The 7D is a professional level camera the rebel is not.Is the 7D worth $900 more than the rebel I would say definitely. I would say if you want a very nice entry level camera just above a point and shoot buy the rebel. If you want a professional level camera at a very good price buy the 7D. I think my fellow photographer that wrote that review didn't realize what he had in his hand when he made those comments. For me I am amazed the 7D is only $900 more than the rebel.

What can I say that hasn't already been mentioned?  Probably not much :) The Canon 7D is the camera I was looking for!  I owned the Canon 50D for one year before getting the 7D in November 2010.  (Please note, I am a verified purchaser of both bodies.)  There were two features missing from the 50D that I really wanted: built in wireless flash and wireless remote.  Not sure why it took Canon so lonngggg to put wireless flash into their bodies.  I *almost* switched to Nikon to get it.I use the 7D's wireless off-camera flash control indoors and outdoors.  It works great in both situations.  The commuication between body and flash is very impressive!  Indoors, the flash's infrared doesn't even need to be pointed at the camera.  And the setup is very easy, and quick.  Just turn on my 580EX II, set wireless flash control in the 7D menu -- done.  Literally takes about 30 seconds and I can start shooting.Now keep in mind, the built-in wireless has it's limitations.  For example, outdoors in bright sunlight, or at distances over 20 feet, or outdoors when no line of sight.  Suffices to say radio triggers still have their uses.  For my needs though, the built in control has been flawless, very slick!Oh and there are a few other little trimmings and perks on the 7D that I also enjoy.* Dedicated On/Off switch.* Micro focus adjustment (MFA).* High ISO is just a tad better than the 50.  Have to pixel peep to see it though.* Menu item to enter your copyright information.* 100% viewfinder.* Lots of buttons on the back, all laid out very nicely, and some customizable.Quick comment about the 7D's video.  I've only used it twice.  Video looks amazing.  But I find my little video camera is more practical for everyday use.  In video mode, the 7D eats CF cards for breakfast!  Also, processing the movie files requires a sufficiently powered computer.  Just something to be aware of.Anyway, I'm really enjoying my 7D.  I got a Think Tank ~ Retrospective 30 for Christmas.  I find that having a nice everyday bag like that makes me want to carry my 7D with me wherever I go.  Fun stuff!

Rather amazing that Canon would produce such an feature-packed update on a camera that is three years old!  Thanks Canon :)The full details of the 2.0 firmware are on Canon's 7D page at usa.canon.com.  Here's synopsis of what it contains.* Ability to set time zone and daylight savings time.* Improved maximum burst for RAW images (up to 25).* Ability to set ISO limit (handy if shooting on auto ISO).* Changing the file naming convention.* Sound recording manual adjustment.* Rate images (1 - 5 stars, same rating as you get in Canon's Digital Photo Professional software).* Review images sorted by their rating.* \"Q\" button can now be used during playback mode to access pertinent features (such as ratings, highlight alert, etc).* Ability to process RAW images within the camera.* Ability to resize JPG images within the camera.* GPS settings (requires the Canon GP-E2 GPS Receiver, sold separately).Pretty cool eh?

WEATHER SEALEDand much better build is what I hear from my 5D Mark II friends who are amazedby the quality of this \"enthusiasts\" camera.  Yeah, enthusiastic about quality gearand professional images.DO put good quality glass on this thing and you will not be disappointed!  Bestbet buy the body only and pick and chose your lenses.  I started with a Canon 100-400mmLand just for fun a \"nifty fifty\" Canon 50mm f1.8. I also have for lightweight travel a Canon70-300USM IS and  will be buying the Canon 15-85mm.  Also on my list for theyear is the Canon 24-105mmL also weathersealed.IF you are shooting primarily landscape save your money and don't bother in investingin \"fast\" lenses.  You need the smaller aperture for full focus landscapes.  If you are shootingsome wildlife as well, like I do, then get a couple of faster zooms.  I chose the less fast100-400mm for versatility instead of the Canon 400mm.  Both work very well.If you are pondering the choice of the 7D know that it is heavier than the Sony a700 and theCanon 60D, 50D and 40D.  I have the 40D as a secondary camera.  I like this camera for it imagequality and portability.  I use it in good lighting situations for landscape and keep my 100-400mmmounted on the 7D, and will use the Canon 24-105 on it as well.The metering and ISO quality is hands down the best thing I have seen and I can shoot in snowand not worry if I get caught in some rain (depending on the lens).If you have the money and want this camera, get it.  If you want the camera and don't have the money,save up, sell something off, whatever, but you wont be sorry about the image quality. THis thing has a greatsensor and DUAL image processors.  Canon did a great job on this, and the video in low light is incrediblethough I don't use it often I have videoed Elk in near dark and the image quality and, even the audio wasimpressive.At the time of this posting I have owned/tested the 7D for over 3 months using various lenses on it.FYI,  Most people are not aware that there can be large differences in images quality in camera and lens batchesof the SAME model camera and lens.  I tested 3 different 7Ds and kept the sharpest of the three. I used the same sharp50mm lens on all three exactly same shooting conditions, tripod etc.  I also did this with the Canon 70-300ISM US and foundthe same thing to be true.  This happens all the time and from what I have seen the newer the camera or lens TENDS tobe the best quality, but to be certain test out your gear before buying and make CERTAIN you can return your gearif it does not perform as expected.Quality discrepancies occur in every brand of camera and lens, some are just worse than others.  I have found thisto be very true concerning Sigma and Tamron lenses where quality control can be quite lax.Have fun and Happy shooting!December 21, 2011I've owned the 7D for over a year now and I've really put it through the paces.  THis is a truework horse and has consistently put out excellent images.  I have, since my original reviewsold my canon 100-400L (Dust collector) and replaced it with a Canon 70-200L IS F4 plus Canon TX 1.4II (both weather sealed).  THis lens in combination with the 7D creates spectacular images for publishing.  I have also added the legendary Canon 24-105L as well as the Canon 17-40L and can report that both of these lenses produce absolutely publish worthy images and are weather sealed.I sold the Canon 70-300USM IS as I just could not get acceptable sharp images for my use.I replaced it with the Tamron 70-300 VC and will say it is one amazing low cost lens.  Wellworth the price and much better for my uses than the Canon which I found lacking in buildquality and image quality.  I found the AF much better on the Tamron and the IS more usefulas well.The only thing I would change about the 7D would be an extended eyepiece as standard, sothat my face isn't pressed against the LCD. But I was able to remedy this buying a thirdparty extension, just make certain it's the one for the 1D series as it's larger than the rest ofCanon's DSLRs.The 7D stands up to tough environments...  hot, dry and dusty weather, and frigid, snowy and thenwet weather.  Using weather sealed \"L\" lenses makes this camera nearly impervious to any adverseweather.  My next addition will either be in the 1D Line or a 5D II, but I'll be keeping this 7Duntil it either wears out, or they offer another model that can offer the same quality and stilltake cropped images for wildlife and action.Also, I have no regrets in NOT waiting for Sony to finally release the Sony A77.  After viewing imagestaken with both the Sony A77 and the Canon 7D, the newer Sony still comes up short in imagequality for my uses.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "More than I expected 7D vs D300s", "Author": "egmancera", "ReviewID": "R1VZZSL2KBZ6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "More than I expected 7D vs D300sBefore the 7D I was a Nikon user, I decided to shift to Canon because I was looking for a new camera and the D300s wasn't good enough and I could easily sell my Nikkor lenses to buy Canon lenses, the best thinks about the 7D are:1) Up to ISO 1.600 you have color fidelity and low noise, you can print in color with no problem, the D300s only have color fidelity and low noise up to ISO 8002) The 7D body is environmental sealing as the D300s but in ergonomics the 7D is much better.3) The 7D can take photos in 18Mpx, 10Mpx and 4.5Mpx, the D300s only in 12Mpx4) You can take Full HD videos in a 7D but not in a D300s5) The 7D has 2 processors and the D300s and the D700 only have 1", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "excellent Pro Am Camera", "Author": "wjwallis", "ReviewID": "R2E1I7K4KQIPIO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a professional photographer ([...]).

I own and operate a local video documentary company and I use video camera's. Until recently, I had never heard of using a digital photo camera to film an event, spot, or feature. I read many articles about the 7D and 5D mark II praising their versatility for film work. I also watched a lot of youtube and other web broadcasting video's showcasing the quality these camera's capture and produce.  After talking to a few photographers and reading the plethora of articles I decided to purchase the 7D. I have not regretted the purchase at all. This camera is versatile. I highly recommend reading the camera manual. It has helped me to understand all the capabilities of the camera. Each setting is described it simple and direct detail. The manual really helps to understand how to take better pictures and why. It really helped my wife, who has really enjoyed using the camera to. The auto function is a great feature to use when you need a friend or family member to take a picture and don't have the time or patience to explain what shutter speed, f stop, and ISO to set and use.  The HD video is incredible. You have a lot of choices: 1080 @ 30,24, 720 @ 60, or 480 @ 60. One of the major reasons to use this camera for video is the abundance of lenses you can use. The slow motion capabilities are extremely good with this camera. The clarity is amazing in every way. I have noticed some noise but, as with any DSLR, if you keep your ISO below 800 it's nonexistent. All my customers are surprised at first when they see me shooting with what appears to be a photo camera. However, when they receive the final product they are very impressed with the detail, dynamic clarity, and vibrant colors this camera captures. Every customer has explained that the production went beyond their expectations. I highly recommend this camera to anyone considering it.

This is because I finally ordered the camera that I wanted and I was full of Joy in getting it delivered.  I received the camera and I immediately began charging the battery and reading the manual.  My Pain came when I put the charged battery into the camera. And after 10 test shots the camera locked up with and Error 40 code and it would not do anything.  I had checked the camera body's firmware code before I started to use it and I was shocked to see that it came to me fully updated to the version 2.0 firmware.  Canon wanted to repair the camera that was literally in use for 2 minutes and I contacted Amazon about the problem.The service was first class and they shipped me a new camera within hours and I received it in two days.  The new camera had the old firmware in it and it works perfectly.  I have shot about 1000 photos and I now have Happiness in that my dream camera is working perfectly and I am mastering it more every week.  This is an excellent camera and I am glad that I purchased it.  The quality of the product and the results that I am getting using it are amazing.I have put together a brief video to show the camera and its basic features.  This camera is so powerful and contains so many features that it is impossible to even cover them in a video with the limitations that I have to meet to post it.  The video is to just let you see the basics.  This camera is one of the top 10 ranked professional video cameras in the world in 2012.  There is a lot of learning curve to understand the powerful potentials that this camera has.  I have written video reviews on the accessories I have purchased like a Canon camera bag, other lenses, lens covers, CF memory cards and lens bags.  If you want to know what all I have acquired to use this beautiful camera then just send me a comment and I will provide more details.I also strongly recommend that you get a full copy of Adobe Photoshop.  I take all of my photos in RAW format and Adobe allows you to do miracles with the RAW format.  This camera is a joy to use and it makes my photography a lot more fun.  The results that I get are wonderful and they help you to remember the moments that you took them.  Isn't that what photography is all about anyway.Accessories and what's in the box:* Digital Camera EOS 7D* Zoom lens EF28 - 135 MM F/3.5-5.6 IS USM* Wide Canon Strap EW-EOS7D* Battery Charger LC-E6* Battery Pack LP-E6* Interface cable* Stereo AV cable* Software CD plus 2 others with technical data* English and Spanish instruction manuals* Canon warranty cards with product numbers on them for the individual products that you receivedIt is important that you make sure that you get the warranty cards and that the registration numbers match the numbers on your products.The Canon Digital Solution Disk is invaluable and it contains powerful software that you need to connect you camera to your computer.  It is good for Macintosh and Windows computers.  The EOS Utility allows you to load the camera shots onto your computer and you can assign a drive that you want the photos stored to.  Make sure that you select a drive that has a lot of space as the camera shots are quite large.  One RAW photo can be as large as 30 MB.  The EOS utility also has a powerful batching utility that allows you to convert large numbers of RAW photos to JPEG photos automatically without your doing each one. The disk also contains powerful digital photo editing software that is very useful.I rate this camera 5 stars and I recommend it to you.

I wanted to shoot more light weight and still wanted that shallow DOF in my images. The Panasonic was good, but I still needed to get a Letus adapter to get the same look. So I started researching What Canon and Nkion had to offer. I am already a Nikon guy and I have the terrific D7000. That camera also does 1080p video, but the only issue is that you can't change the aperture settings while in the live movie mode. But for taking pictures, the camera is my go to body for sure. That left me with a choice between the Canon 60D and the 7D. I was looking at the 60D mainly to save some $$ over the 7D, but in most of the reviews that I looked at the 7D was a better fit with the dual Digic 4 processors. Plus it more in the same class as the Nikon with the magnesium alloy body as well. But like I said, I was looking at this from the perspective that I was only going to use this camera for videos and not photos.I got the body and the Tamron 28-75mm 2.8 and the Canon 50mm 1.4 as the starting point. In my opinion, both of these lenses are a great fit for shooing video. I did not want to get the kit lens, because most of all kit lenses are average at best. Having a constant aperture lens is great because wherever the zoom is, the lens is still fast. I got the prime for more close up work and low light use with the 1.4. The camera body itself is big, but not as big and chunky as the D7000. lots of control buttons and menus to go through but it you take the time to learn them, well worth it. Shooting video is really great because you have complete manual control over every aspect of the camera while in live mode. White balance, aperture and ISO so that you can get that great exposure at the start. I love the fact that you can visually see the changes in the live view. With the Nikon, to change aperture, you have to get out of live view, make the change reset the light meter and then re-engage live mode to set it.I have the 7D mounted to the iDC System Zero base plate with follow focus.

(sorry)The camera takes wonderful picture of everything, from close-up photo (macro) to safari picture with lots of zooming and bumpy rides. The camera takes picture in such a high speed and quality that when I am on safari, 90% of all the pictures are ultra sharp, and no sign of that i am actually bumping up and down on dirt terrain. The camera have excellent low light performance, where you can take lots of great pictures without using the flash (I have still not used the flash once!).The ergonomics is very individual from person to person, but this camera seems to be made especially for my hands, since it fits like a bullet! It is quite heavy, but that is of course I am used to a small Sony digital camera!The menu is easy to understand, and with quick access to all the most important settings, taking picture in all situations only takes seconds to caliber.All in all is this a exceptional camera, and I say that from an objective stand point.

I am a painter and needed a camera for top quality copy work and some landscape work (professionally) and occasional sports photography (for fun). After looking at the T2i, 50D, 60D, 7d and thinking about the 5d mkII I went for the 7d. What a camera!!! I was amazed at the speed of the autofocus system and all the other bells and whistles. 8 fps is a pretty amazing thing and with all the autofocus/metering fine tuning available on this there are way more hits than misses. However after a month of rigorous use I could simply not get the clarity I needed. At iso 100 the image was fine but by 800 iso images were less than what is available on a good point and shoot. I tried everything..all the built-in adjustments and I even added a few L series lenses to the mix but to no avail. I unloaded it and bought the 5d mkII. I finally have the clarity I needed BUT I do not have everything else...the 7d is a remarkable machine...I miss the raw/jpeg button, the Q button, the fully functional live-view feature, the built-in viewfinder grid option, the flash remote sync, the level...etc etc etc....oh and the speed and accuracy of the AF system...the 5d is awfully slow.... But again, I have the picture clarity I needed and in the end that is what counts. Come on Canon, clean up that 7d sensor (or replace it w/a full size sensor)....bells and whistles are cool...even highly functional but I still care about the simple quality of the image.

I took the 7d as my sole video camera down to Costa Rica to shoot a little documentary there, and found it to be very clunky to use in this sort of 'run and gun' capacity.  When shooting video with it, you really need to have the camera support by a tripod, or shoulder mount or steady cam or something.  Using it on its own is really clunky, and shaky.

Moving up from an entry level DSLR, I opted for the middle of the pack 7D. I liked it's versatile package, great build quality, and overall value. The one thing I did have a reservation on was the fact that it is not a full frame sensor. If you don't know why this is an issue, you may not be alone. At the time, I couldn't justify the step up to a 5D simply for the full frame sensor. 18 months later, it is a decision I kick myself for nearly every day. It's hard to explain the exact reasons why this has become such an issue, but I'm full of analogies and I'm about to unleash them all on you.Putting a 50mm lens on a full frame camera gives you, as you would expect, a 50mm shot. It is performing exactly as it was designed to perform. Put that same lens on a crop sensor camera like the 7D, and you're getting closer to a 70mm shot. Why is this an issue? Outside the nifty 50 (50mm 1.8), the wider the focal length, the more expensive, typically, the lenses become. So to get a true 50mm focal length on a crop sensor camera, you need a 35mm lens.. which is more. To get a 35mm shot, you need a 24mm lens.. which is more still. In saving a few hundred dollars on my camera body, I have spend much much more on lenses to compensate for this. It's something I didn't consider and something I think should really be taken into account.The 7D does do certain things amazingly though, in some cases better than the 5D. It's burst rate is much faster (8FPS) than the 5, so it's wonderful for sports, wildlife, anything you need to spit out a lot of frames in a short period of time.With the release of the 6D and 5D Mark III however, I feel that the 7D has become a little dated a little quickly. The 6D, in particular, gives customers a full frame sensor for just a small investment above the 7D. Sure, it doesn't have as \"advanced\" auto focus system as the 7D, but I honestly find myself using center point focus almost exclusively anyway. The body is made from slightly cheaper materials, but you honestly won't notice holding it in your hands.All in all, the 7D was a wonderful purchase 18 months ago. Now though?

Well first off the Nikon and Canon had many thoughtful and detailed reviews. The Canon had reviews by relative beginners, and many advanced and pro users. The tipping point for me was Canon's high satisfaction rating by DPreview. ( 84% ). One big selling feature is, that it is made in Japan!, wow something made by the country that designed it. Not farmed out to cheap third world countries. That's big to me, it hits home considering all the jobs being lost to cheap labor these days. One thing that's important to remember, is, that the great quality lenses that were made in Japan, were made from the design to the finished product with strict quality control. That said, let's move on to the camera itself. First off, I took the advice of many reviewers that shunned the \" kit \" lenses. I got the body and the 15-85 mm Canon EF lens. Amazon got it to me in a blazing fast 24 hours. This camera is intuitive in it's layout and operation. I'm a guy, I operate on the premise, that, when all else fails, read the instructions. Well, this camers has so much going on, I finally did pull out the manual. Before I did that, I did some shooting around the house, both inside and out. Great results, I knew I had made a great choice. A few days later I took it out on trip shooting landscapes, which is what I shoot the most. The 15 to 85 mm zoom was exactly what I needed. I tried the auto modes, and although they do a good job, I preferred using the program mode. I used the landscape picture control. I had shot this area last year, but with this camera and lens, the color, the definition and overall look, was outstanding. When I looked at them on the computer, it looked like I was actually there. The way it cut through the atmospheric haze over the mountains in the background, was impressive. After that trip I started setting up the user controls until I had different setups for every possible scenario I might encounter. The combinations of user assigned functions makes this a great choice for advanced users. Of course, that's probably one of the reasons that you will buy a camera of this quality. On Christmas I set it up on a tripod and shot a series of pics from behind the coach with my wife and I close together with A Christmas Story playing. Using the self timer, I got the little guy aiming him air rifle on the big screen and the one with his broken glasses on, ( you'll put out your eye ). I used higher ISOs and shot in ambient light and got perfect results. I have a lot more to learn about this camera as with all of its control features it is has a long learning curve. This camera is built like a tank, it is no lightweight. When you pick it up it is noticeably heavier than the Nikon.

Higher FPS is ideal for wild-life.Both Wildlife and Macro requires cropping, but with this body, your average MBs for your shots will be HIGHER than with the full frame body.

This instead will be a basic overview of an amateur's impressions, falling somewhere between 'This camera is cool. Buy it!' and 'This particular model features a reverse prism entanglement that is really handy when...' Ok, I totally made up that prism thing. But it sounded cool, right?Anyway, I got my first DSLR 2 1/2 years ago when I bought Canon's XSi/450D. Never having used an SLR before, I had no idea what aperture was, ISO or some of the other fancy terms the manual talked about, and knew it was a big jump from point-and-shoot. In essence, I had a lot to learn. After all, this camera was complicated! At least, at the time I thought it was. Long story short, after a few books and time spent with the camera, I felt like I had a decent grasp on things. I even felt like a big shot at times with my big bad DSLR when everyone around me had point-and-shoots and camera phones.When the time rolled around for upgrade, I looked at a few different cameras. I was deciding between three cameras: the new (at the time) 60D, the 7D and the 5D. For various reasons I chose the 7D over the 60D (wary of brand new/untested-by-the-public model, magnesium alloy body vs. plastic, 8 frames per second) and over the 5D (couldn't justify the extra money for a little better low-light, full frame sensor, and actually slower frames per second).When the camera arrived a few things struck me off the bat. First, this camera is big. I've never held a pro-grade camera before. At least, not one like this. I thought the XSi was big, and it is compared to point-and-shoots. This one's big compared to my XSi. And it's heavy. 5 lbs if memory serves me. Some people may not like the bulk and whine about how heavy it can be, but I like it. I like holding something and feeling it, knowing I'm holding something real instead of a toy. That isn't to say a lighter camera is a toy, but you know what I mean.Second, when I looked the camera over, I got the same helpless feeling I got when I first held my XSi: I have a lot to learn. But in reality, if you understand a lot of the basics in photography (aperture, shutter, ISO) and have used a DSLR before, it's mostly just learning a new camera.It doesn't have the cheater presets on the main dial (portrait, landscape, etc.) which, honestly, I never used on any camera anyway. It has a lot of new buttons and knobs my old camera didn't have. The one I like most is the thumb dial. I know a lot of Canon cameras have this, but it's new to me and I like it. I also like that it has a dedicated switch to swap between Live View for movie recording and regular viewfinder still shooting.Where my XSi did a fairly decent job of shooting in low light situations, it's almost unfair how much better this one is. At 1600 ISO, the highest setting it has, the XSi has a large amount of noise in the picture. The 7D has less at 3200 ISO and maybe 6400. Of course, there's always programs that can reduce the noise. I like Adobe Lightroom. But the more noise you remove, the more detail you remove. And since the 7D creates very little noise at higher ISO's, noise reduction is much less a problem.Another thing I really like about this camera is the 8 fps (frames per second). As a baseball fan, I love to capture the motion of the batter's swing or the pitcher's delivery to the plate. While it's great for sports, the high rate can be good in everyday areas, too. I like to shoot in bursts. It makes later processing a little more work, but also makes it a little more likely that you're going to get THE picture. Photographing children can be a challenge, partly because they're so active. Their facial expressions can change several times in less than a heartbeat. A fast shutter and finger are needed, but the rapid fire of this camera does a lot of the work for you.The 18-135mm lens that comes with the camera is the best lens I have. Keep in mind that I have a very small \"collection,\" but I really like this lens. It takes pretty sharp pictures and has a great range. It may not have Ultrasonic focusing, but it's still very quick and pretty quiet. It is also an image stabilized lens, which comes in very handy at pretty much all focal lengths.I love this camera. The only issues I have with it are: 1. autofocusing in Live View, and 2. navigating menus. My XSi also had Live View available and the autofocusing was terrible. It took forever to focus, if it even did. Luckily, it was usually pointless on that camera to use Live view as it did not take video. You have to on the 7D, though, if you want to take video, and it's Live View autofocus seems no better. That is unless you want to manually focus, which is what I've been doing when recording video. Hopefully, I'll learn a better way to focus. Other than that, it does a great job on movies. Good picture and sound quality. As someone who only makes an occasional video, I can't say how it compares to other cameras, but it satisfies me.As for the second of my so-called issues, navigating menus, I'm only referring to the fact that the multiple knobs and joystick can make it a little confusing when moving through the camera to know which to use. It has no bearing on the actual operation of the camera, and can probably be mostly chalked up to user (me) error. I wouldn't hold that against it.The 7D is everything I want in a camera, from it's fast and low-light shooting, ability to capture video, and it just plain looks cool! I feel like a pro with it, even if I'm not. I would never tell someone just starting out that they have to start at the bottom when it comes to equipment. If you're willing to spend the money, and want to start at or near the top, go for it. Just be aware this is the real deal, and there's a steep learning curve that comes with it.

What I wanted out of the new camera was better low light performance, faster frame rate, and a larger size body for my large hands. Durability was also an important factor since I wasn't planning to upgrade my DSLR again anytime soon. At first, I was considering the 50D, but the more advanced AF system and HD video were nice features to have. First thing I noticed about the 7D was how nicely it felt in my hands. I shoot with the 17-55 f/2.8 IS and 70-200 f/4 L IS and while those lenses felt a little clumsy on the XTi, they felt really good on the 7D. Picture quality under low light conditions was very good to me. I'm even happy with the results using ISO 3200. All the buttons and the menu system are well laid out and it's easy to navigate to select the functions I want to use. The 100% viewfinder is a lot more comfortable to use and I also quickly enjoyed having the scroll wheel on the back as well as the top LCD display to check camera settings. I like the different sized RAW settings and if I'm not shooting using sRAW, I'm using S normal. The 18MP sensor is nice, but who really needs it? The 3-inch LCD on the back is very nice for previewing my pictures. If you're happy with the APS-C sensor and am looking for good low light performance with fast frame rate, this is the camera to get. Keep in mind that although the HD video feature is nice, it can be a little clumsy to use since there is no AF while filming.

The wirerless flash features are pretty good also. You can adjust each of your flashes from the camera and even use the built in flash along with other wireless flashes. The only down side is that the flashes have to be within 80 degrees of sight of the camera. Because of this I will still use pocket wizards but its still good to know that you have a solid backup if your pocket wizards fail or you dont have another choice. Figure out how to use the picture stlye software also. This can save a lot of time editing colors and sharpness in photoshop or lightroom. With picture stlye you can create setting, load them on your camera and, shoot away. They can be changed with a click of a mouse in photo professional if you ever need to change a setting.

So since she knows all the technical stuff - and I'm more of an observer than an actual user - but I hope this helps.First off - the way I ended up with this camera was my wife had a Canon Rebel (and some lenses) that she had for two years. She's an avid photohog and is tinkering with the idea of doing it for money, but needed an upgrade. I thumbed through Consumer Reports and found that this 7D is rated as hands-down the best consumer-level DSLR on the market. It cited many reasons that this model was the best, but frankly I forgot them all.My wife however was flirting with the idea of a Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera because she was considering a professional track. When back home over the holidays she was talking to a photographer in the family who has 3 of the 5Ds and talked her out of that model. The major difference in the two (with the 5D being nearly a thousand bucks more expensive) was that the 7D does not have a crop sensor. That's about it from what I gathered from our conversation with the professional photographer.Other observations:-The pictures that she has taken are great - Just great. This will depend on the skills of the photographer and the lenses you use of course, but in the hands of someone who knows that they are doing - I can see a marked improvement in pictures from the old Canon Rebel.-I hear the video is a little complicated to use, and I haven't seen any footage yet, but I don't think the average person is buying this as a video camera.The four our of five stars for the ease of use is based on moving up from another Canon DSLR. For the first-time user who is looking for a nice camera but has never used anything more than a point-an-shoot - I would recommend starting off smaller (unless you really do just have so much money that you don't care). The two years that she spent taking pictures on the Rebel have really paid off. Plus they say that a camera body has a finite number of shutter clicks - sp better for her to get the first two years out of the way on a learner camera.All and all my wife is uber-pleased with it and as a result, so am I. The price on Amazon was as good as any retailer in the area, plus I cashed in on free shipping and no tax. I really couldn't have asked for more from Amazon.

With the right fast memory card, this camera shoots very fast.  You can stop action with this very well.Low light performance is great. Much of this depends on the lens you use, of course, but I would rate the camera very well for overall low light performance.Very easy to use.  The controls are in logical places, the screens and menus make sense, and the layout of the camera is fantastic.  It fits very, very well in my hands.  I had the T1i previous to the 7D, and it was just too small for me.  The 7D is a perfect fit.Love that it is weather sealed. I don't wait for the rain to come and then go take pictures, but I have been able to use the 7D a few times in light rain where that would not have been possible without weather sealing.3 inch LCD is very nice for viewing and reviewing your photos right after you take them.  You can zoom in quite a ways with the LCD to see how sharp your pictures are.Build quality is sturdy.Battery slips in and out with no trouble.  The charger that comes with it is nice.  Plugs straight into the wall without any cords.This camera is excellent and very enjoyable.  We take it everywhere and are able to preserve fun and precious family moments.

I shoot 3200 to 6400 ISO and the pictures are still acceptable and in my opinion better than the D300s. The best part over the Nikon are the ergonomics which are much nicer, with Nikon I had to use my right hand a lot while looking through the viewfinder which was a bit awkward at times but with 7D everything could be done just using the left hand.

Tipton", "ReviewID": "R235OY8UCXENOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been wanting to upgrade my T1i for a while now, but decided to wait until the 60D was announced to do anything, and then ended up buying a 7D soon after the announcement. I was waiting/hoping to see if the 60D would have features that I wanted for cheaper but.... no such luck. I will probably still try to get my hands on a 60D when it comes out to see how I like it and to give it a review also, but for now I just wanted to express my extreme delight in the 7D. If I knew this camera would be this good, I would have bought it a long time ago.I say that I'm delighted with the camera for one very big reason: the auto-focus system. It's astounding and better than any camera I have tried yet. I shoot a lot of action shots and wanted a camera that I could quickly attain focus on fast moving subjects. Someone who shoots mainly still/landscape shots or who has no use for the quick autofocus might be satisfied with the T2i or 60D for less money or much happier with the full frame 5D mkII. For me, my decision between the 60D and 7D was made up as soon as I heard the 60D had the same autofocus system of the 50D - a decent 9 point all cross-type autofocus system, but one that can't touch the 19 point all cross-type 7D system. I would have really liked to see at least a slight improvement in the 60D over its predecessor.The autofocus system on the 7D is nothing short of brilliant and I am attaining close to 10x the number of usable shots than what I was with my T1i before. it allows you to choose several different modes of using it's 19 points. The 19 points on the 7D's system cover the same area that the 50D and 60D's systems do, but they offer more density in that area, which allows you to use modes like point expansion and zone auto-focus. In the point expansion, it uses one point to monitor for focus, but it if can't attain focus based on that one point, it will look in the four surrounding points also. The zone system uses set zones of points to look for focus in. These 2 features have helped me a great deal where before I would be using a single point and hoping to attain focus with it, or use a general all point autofocus, which was not anywhere near as quick. In addition, the 7D has a new spot autofocus feature that will hone in one a particular point that is much smaller than the normal single point autofocus. This helps a great deal in still photos or in action shots where you know where the action will be.The brilliant autofocus system of the 7D sold me almost immediately, but it also has a wide variety of great features like wireless flash control, a magnesium alloy body (60D is plastic), a horizontal and vertical level (the 60D only has horizontal), and above everything else except for the AF system: a fantastic viewfinder. It offers 100% coverage and 1.0x magnification with a transmissive LCD screen. What this means is that what you see in the viewfinder is what you take a picture of - unlike several other cameras that cut off the edges in the view finder. The transmissive LCD allows you to overlay autofocus zones/spots and grids when you are looking through - very useful.Now, my one negative aspect about the 7D might actually be a plus for many people: the size and weight. It's pretty hefty and for a person with small hands like me, the camera feels pretty big. A lot of people like the feeling of a large, solid camera though.There are numerous features and aspects about this camera that I could touch on, but for the sake of brevity, I will just say that I am very pleased with the ISO sensitivity/noise ratio - although I probably won't take too many shots above 1600 and try to stay below 800. The burst rate of 8 shots/sec is fantastic, but for both that and the high def video, I recommend a compact flash card above 133x. I have been using a 133x with okay results, but have overloaded the buffer a couple of times. I will invest in a faster card soon.Overall, I'm very pleased with the 7D and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants to take nice action shots.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from the 20D, and use a 5DmkII at work extensively", "Author": "Art Vandalay", "ReviewID": "RIFFEN5FX96YX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just adding to all the reviews here: my comparison with the 5D is that the 7D is indeed a worthy product for the price difference.

After weighing my options, I almost went for the 60D instead but the more robust build quality and additional features of the 7D won out in the end.I've been using this camera for a few months now and am absolutely loving it. Having taken a few thousand images, I'm very happy with my results and would highly recommend this camera to someone wanting to move up from an entry-level DSLR!There's been a lot of reviews amply covering the great features of this camera so I thought I'd tackle an issue that seems to be rather contentious and has some people very needlessly upset  - I'm talking about digital noise. This is the kind of noise that is an unwanted side effect of a high-pixel-density sensor like the 18 megapixel one found in the 7D.I'm glad to be able to say that t he noise profile on the 7D is actually *very* good! Unless I heavily underexpose or use extremely high ISOs, noise is a non-issue - even looking at images at 100%.  Even up into ISOs well above 1600 I've had very good luck taking very usable shots.At the pixel density of the sensor, I was actually expecting much worse. When I first looked at my shots on my computer monitor at 100% the clarity and smoothness was impressive unless the images were extremely dim. That's not to say these extreme images were completely noise-free but all but the highest printing sizes were still very good quality, and this was on the \"problem\" shots. What current sensor technology is running into are artifacts caused from the physics of photon behavior, ambient heat and the limits of the mechanics of the sensor technology itself.The behavior of the universe we live in is causing these artifacts. For a higher signal-to-noise ratio, the solution is to get more *signal* - more light hitting the sensor. Faster lenses and shooting in brighter settings help immensely. If you want relatively noise-free underexposed-looking images where noise would be troublesome, say for sillouettes and such, photograph at higher exposures than your target then, after the fact, yank your histogram to the left in photoshop or your favorite raster editing app. You'll have the same look you were going for.Overall, I've found the Canon EOS 7D to be a superb tool capable of very high quality images devoid of noise in all but the most extreme low light environs or intentionally underexposed shots.

I was pleased with that one as it was my first DSLR I had ever owned. I learned a lot during my time with it, and it served its purposes well. As my interest in expanding and enhancing my photography has increased, I realized it was definitely time for a new camera and lenses. I swayed on with kit lens to get with the Canon 7D since I had heard horror stories about kit lens quality, yet it was only a bit more to get the camera with a lens. After much research, I decided on this kit and I'm thrilled! The lens is not as loud as I had expected after reading some reviews. I'm not a wedding or religious photographer, so maybe it would be a bit of a problem in those circumstances?  The camera is amazing! I honestly didn't realize what I was missing! I investigated so many cameras and really am partial to Canon since all my Canon gear has done well thus far. I won't be using this for videos, but that's a nice option for those of you who will. One thing I read about and was hesitant for was the auto-focus speed and accuracy. I think it's a gem though myself! I have my new lenses, accessories and all ready to go.

I purchased it as an upgrade to my Rebel Xsi, which I felt I had outgrown (I have TONS more to learn, I know...but I wanted a camera that had a lot more room for growth). The Rebel served me well, but I'm excited about the possibilities I have with the 7D. I should add, I'm an \"experienced amateur\"/semipro.One of the features I really like so far is the ability to use the 7D as a master unit for an off camera flash. I have the 430 EXII, which I've been using for a year or two now, and I love it. But I'd love to try some backlit shots as well as other creative lighting techniques. In just having this for a couple days, here's one shot I got: [...]I'm excited to try out the focusing capabilities in a variety of situations and with different lenses. I've already played around with fine tuning (\"microadjusting\") the focusing for different lenses. {See this article for more: [...]} I knew my 85 1.8 had been misbehaving for awhile when focusing, but I couldn't fix it (aside from manually focusing) on my Rebel. Now I can. Accurate focus is super important to me because I shoot wide apertures and usually tight shots...every centimeter is critical. One thing I find slightly annoying is that the focusing spot is a rather large rectangle. I'd like it to be a dot. You can turn Spot AF on in custom functions, which I did...it adds a smaller spot in the middle of the rectangle, but the rectangle is still there. I'm sure it's just going to take some getting used to.The camera feels much more rugged, heavy, and sturdy than the Rebel. So far, I'm loving it and have been glued to my manual!", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade from 20D", "Author": "Chris S. \"Tech/Photo/Music Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R1D4N7ZDVWVECV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to upgrade from my 20D, and was trying to decide between the 5D Mark 2, or the 7D. I decided to go with the 7D because of the upgraded autofocus, and the amazingly fast burst speed of 9fps, plus it's quite a bit less expensive. And I'm sure glad I did.The camera feels absolutely solid in my hands, I can tell this is a camera that will function wonderfully no matter what conditions you put it through. And I know it's a camera that I'll be using for a very long time. The new 19 point autofocus system is a joy to use, and allows for pinpoint accuracy in a matter of seconds. The external flash control and firing ability is great to have built into the camera, rather than having to attach an extra (expensive) accessory to your camera when shooting studio stuff.I also find myself playing with the video mode a lot. It's nice to have both still and full HD video in one camera, even better that you can take pictures while you're taking video.Upgrading from my 20D to the 7D feels like upgrading from an amateur camera that's been hanging by a thread these past few years to upgrading to a pro-level camera that will last many years. I honestly can't see any features that it'd like to see introduced in the future, the autofocus is perfect (anymore would be overkill), MP count is more than enough, build quality is superb, ISO noise performance is miles ahead of the 20D (this alone is worth the upgrade). This camera has every feature and extra setting that I could ever want in a camera.

Needless to say I spent weeks researching on the web, reading blogs, talking to friends before I made my choice. The learning curve is actually pretty quick on this camera and I found the displays easier to figure out than many common (and far simpler) p&s; camera's which always seem to use meaningless 'icons' for settings. While outside I was lucky enough to have a bird fly just over me and while in full automatic mode I was able to rapidly snap off 5 or 6 pictures each of which focused PERFECTLY on the bird. The display shows you the focal points it uses in the review and does not hold up the camera while displaying the review picture. The 8 fps works great in the other modes and takes pictures like a machine gun for capturing fast moving scenes! With just a few moments I was able to take shots of the moon showing the craters, and even the mountains at the edge of the dark zone showed up crystal clear even with the auto focus. The live view is an incredible asset when used this way as you can zoom in 5X or 10X and focus perfectly in to your scene. The live view is also a LOT easier to use than the eyepiece when your camera is at an odd angle as well. The 18-135mm is likely going to be my most often used lens as it is small, versatile and takes a pretty nice picture. I ordered the camera from 42nd street photo and received it two days after ordering via the FREE GROUND shipment. In the week prior I ordered a CF card from a competitor and a nifty fifty (50mm F1.8) from another competitor and have yet to even get tracking numbers. 42nd street has a customer for life now. For add on's I would recommend an extra battery (common sense), and a decent (FAST) memory card.

I just purchased this camera recently and it works so fine so far. I've explored some of its options and menus and they are awesome. I've shifted from my very-old 350D to this more advanced model, so some options and characters are new to me. The weight is heavier a bit than my old camera but this is not an issue I believe. The body has a nice touch to the hand, not harsh and not smooth and would help on stabilizing the camera a bit in your hand (while the 350D body was smooth relatively and would slip sometimes).Some of the many good options and choices this camera has are:1. Live view: Like the point and shoot cameras, you can take a picture by designing the shot in the LCD preview, and you can also view it through a 3x3 grid or 5x5 grid to compose your scene accordingly. Personally, I don't think I will be using this option so much since I'm more used now to the viewfinder.2. Digital level: This thing is viewable only when you switch to the live view mode, and it enables you to level your camera accordingly without any need to the typical spirit level, either on your tripod or your camera's hotshoe.3. Quick settings: It has a quick settings button by which you can make all the settings you want in a fast mode. Simply press the button and the LCD screen will show you all the settings, and you can browse among them using the joystick and change the settings by the top dial.4. Three additional customized modes free for the user to register them under any preferable settings.5. Bulb mode is separated from the (M)anual mode, and not like my old 350D.6. Customizable control-points settings. You can choose 3 different models for your control points, and see them in the viewfinder accordingly.7. Wireless capabilities, which is, to me, so and so.8. Beside various JPEG qualities, you can choose as well various RAW sizes: RAW, M-RAW, S-RAW; with around 18MP, 10MP and 4.5MP resolutions respectively.9. It has different presets of styles for shooting which control colors' contrast and sharpness, and you can set your own settings as well (but personally I go with neutral look and adjust things later).10. It has direct black-and-white shooting, although I heard it is better to avoid this mode in some books, because you won't have much freedom controlling the levels so much. It's better to shoot in colors and convert it to B&W; according to your likings later.11. The modes dial is situated on the left. It might not be a big issue, but it is sure a nice placement for me. I think it enables you to switch with your left without losing the grip on the camera with your right hand. Suitable for fast-paced work and shoot I believe.The wireless settings in this camera was a bit tricky. Wireless here is meant to be beam-based wireless, i.e. infrared beams. It is good (and essential) for controlling various accessories like the Speedlite dedicated flashes, but when it comes to a remote control, this is a disadvantage. For a remote control, I would advise of using a cable remote (which the camera is capable of too), because with a wireless remote, you would have to be in front of the camera or at least on the side, but if you plan to work behind the camera (which is the case for me most of the time) it's going to be some hard time triggering the shutter from the back. A beam-less wireless capability would be far more useful than IR.I wouldn't talk about the image quality here, because I think it is obvious by now.I didn't try the video mode, mainly because I'm not interested in this field. I believe this option has raised the camera's price accordingly. I was looking for a camera with such options but without the video mode, simply because I don't need it. The price is an issue here of course but if you are serious about your hobby or profession it is a great investment (with the right lenses). I suggest though, and I don't know about the marketing lines that Canon are involved in, that such video mode would be separated, to drop down the price a little.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Eric Andrew Collection", "ReviewID": "R2VJGT0PYHLVTG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really happy with this camera.

Since I am familiar with the 30D, the 7D is intuitive.

It opens up possibilities that simply did not exist. I was not going to lug around more equipment than needed.--battery use is as expected. I did shoot for 8 hours straight without any issues.  A lot of looking back at pictures and adjusting things with menus.CONS:--weight. But there is no way around this.--price.  Once again, you get what you pay for. This is simply  a great camera.--menu functions are not as easy as before.--maybe it is because I am still learning, but the creative settings are just not that easy to use.--manual is okay, but it may be worthwhile to add a DVD that shows options  etc. A lot of what I learned were trial and error.CONCLUSIONS:I moved up to 7D because of sensor issues with my 30D.I opted for the 7D over the 5D for cost and the 5D is not going to do things more efficiently than the 7D. I did borrow a buddy's 5D recently, and it is a great camera, but not mush better than the  7D.

Alexander", "ReviewID": "RANEH0WR8FXLI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently had the chance to spend a few days with a friend's 7D and use it for an event shoot that lasted about six hours. My camera for many years was a 40D, and before that, a 300D. There are some notable dissimilarities between the two semi-pro bodies. Most of my comments about the 40D also apply to the 50D.If you're familiar with any of the recent Canon bodies, the 7D won't be a major transition. The brunt of the learning curve is in learning how best to use the new AF system and how to quickly transition between modes. It took about two hours of fiddling to optimize the camera for my shooting style. After that, switching between the 7D and 40D required no effort.BUILD:The 7D's grip is shorter on the lens axis than the 40D, and both are shorter than the 300D. Grip comfort is proportional to depth. My fingertips scrape the camera body more on the 7D than the 40D. I don't care for that. The 300D tops both of the new bodies here. Canon's also changed the button mechanisms. All of the major buttons on the 40D have an audible and tactile click when pressed. The 7D buttons just mush down; only the camera's reaction tells you if the press was effective.Build-wise, the two feel very similar. Without a lens, the 40D is a touch lighter. With a lens that weighs more than a pound, they're interchangeable.LAYOUT:The rear layout of the 7D has changed in subtle ways. With the 40D, I shoot single-point AF, manually selecting the point with the 8-way hat switch and activating it solely with the AF-ON button. This means my thumb is constantly switching from the hat switch to AF-ON. On the 7D, that switch is about a half-centimeter lower, so the transition is more awkward.I've had to change my shooting style to compensate; AF on the 7D is now bound to the shutter button. The reason I hadn't done this on the 40D is that if AF and exposure are on the same button, the camera will wait for AF before taking the picture. If the focus point isn't quite on a contrast, the camera may rack the lens, and you'll have long since missed the shot. The only way around that is to use AI-Servo instead of One-Shot, but the 40D has serious hunting problems in that mode.AUTOFOCUS:On the 7D, Canon's added a couple of AF modes. The most useful of the lot is Zone AF, which is a lot like manually picking a point, except you're manually picking one of five zones. Each zone has a couple of AF points, so you're always likely to end up on some contrast. It's less accurate than a single-point selection, but close enough for any lens f/2 or slower.The physical process of using Zone AF and manually selecting zones with the hat switch is very quick, even more so than my old system with the 40D because there's no thumb-switching. The time to acquire focus and actually fire, though, is a bit slower than the 40D just because of the Zone-AF calculations. You can compensate by using a single AF point with the 7D, but moving between them is more involving because there are 19 relative to the 40D's 9. The AF-point selector has to be on an axis with other AF points to move to them. Because the AF grid has outlier points on the middle on the top, button, left, and right, it's too easy to get caught where you can only navigate in one axis. Put another way, you can't go diagonally from certain points to other ones.The 7D's AF micro-adjustment feature is a godsend and is, alone, sufficient reason to prefer it to the 60D and 40D. It costs about $100 to send a body and lens to Canon for calibration. With multiple lenses, they're all likely to front or back-focus slightly, or even significantly, and their accuracy can drift with time. It took Canon three tries to match my 50/1.4 to my 40D. Without adjustment, the lens was unusably soft below f/2.5. Fixing the same issue on the 7D took about fifteen seconds.It's not perfect; I've got a zoom that front-focuses on the long end and back-focuses on a short end, and there are certain lenses that have focus shifts when they stop down, or at certain subject distances. You can't fix everything, but for the basic gross errors, it's a tremendously useful feature.SPEED & NOISE:The 7D needs a 5 FPS shooting mode. I've found for general portraiture, the safety shot at 6.3 FPS on the 40D is a bit too similar to the previous. It's even worse on the 7D, but the slower 3 FPS mode is too far the other way. Shutter noise is equally loud on both bodies. The 7D's is higher-pitched with a motor overtone. The 40D has a slightly longer clack. In Live View mode with no mirror-flipping, the 40D could almost be called subtle; the 7D is much louder here.Battery capacity calculation with the 7D and battery grip doesn't seem to work right. The grip has the option of two lithium cells or 6 AAs. If one of those AAs is down on voltage, the camera can go from a full display to empty almost immediately. With my Eneloops, I measured 1.35V in 5 of them and 1.2V in the last. This was enough to stop the camera. Replacing the last battery for another with 1.3V yielded a full display again and hundreds more shots.UPGRADE?Other than that, the 7D is pretty much as expected. The two killer features relative to the 40D are focus correction and video, and probably to some extent, AI-Servo AF performance. I'm interested in it because I've got lenses with focus shifts. If your lenses work right, your subjects don't move too fast, and you're not a video shooter, there isn't much reason to upgrade.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Canon for the money", "Author": "TVDewd", "ReviewID": "R3QKS4E1L1FUGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Canon user all my life.

At 8 fps, the 7D is only 2 fps slower than the 1D when it comes to shooting wildlife and sports. At 18 mpx, it's even better than the 1D MkIV although the MkIV has a somewhat larger sensor (1.3 vs. 1.6, which should produce lower noise).

I have a 5D Mark II, and specialize in large, canvas close up portraits of children in 24 x 30 and up sizes.  However, I also shoot alot of sports and bought the 7D because of the claimed 8 fps burst speed, dual Digic 4 processors, and much  more advance auto focus system. For the first few months, it performed as advertised as long as there was sufficient light.  Fantastic baseball photos with three or four tack-sharp images per pitch, and two to three sharp images of a single swing by a batter.  The camera was not so great, however, for indoor sports.  As expected, the 7D's low-light performance lags significantly, and image quality cannot compare to the powerhouse 5D Mark II in low light.  Burst speed was considerably lower and images were noisy.One day, for no discernable reason, burst speed dropped to 3 or 4 frames per second even in bright light and stayed there.  I eliminated all user-correctable causes for this, and eventually shipped the camera back to Canon for service.  I received the camera back working fine again with a page out the instruction manual, blown up to 8 x 10 size, and marked with yellow highlighter on the instructions for setting the camera to burst mode, I suppose as Canon's way of saying I was an idiot.The bottom line for me is that the 7D will be a wonderful performer for someone stepping up from a 50D or a Rebel.  It is great for action shots in good light, assuming one doesn't have the same issues I've had with the burst speed.  For outdoor sports shooters, the 7D is fantastic.  However, despite what you may read on the Net, image quality on this crop sensor simply cannot compare to the 5D Mark II for portrait or landscape work.  The 7D's low-light performance is also weak compared to the 5DII.  For an extra 30%, you can get what I believe to be one of the finest DSLR's available anywhere, at any price, in the 5D Mark II.  If you shoot portraits or in low light, the 7D just cannot compare.I look forward to the next generation 5D, which I anticipate will have the 7D's auto focus system.

So I will just discuss my experience with it.I've been a paid semi pro photographer for about 10 years now, portrait, events and college sports.  I've also worked as a paid photographer for a multitude of marathons and other races that come to town.  Over the years I've shot with a long list of DSLRs (Sony, Pentax, Nikon and Canon).  I've shot with the Canon 20D, 30D, 40D, 50D, 7D and so forth.  I was very excited to finally purchase the 7D but I was constantly disappointed by it.For one, it seemed a bit noisy at 100 ISO, much more so than any other Canon I ever used.  Honestly, I got cleaner images (at 100 ISO) with my 20 and 30Ds.  I spoke to Canon about this.  Their response:  \"Well, when you pack that many pixels on a sensor, that sorta thing happens.\"  I'm thinking, really?  This new, near state of the art sensor with dual processors can't take a cleaner image than a sensor you made nearly 10 years ago?  Really?!  Ironically I was very pleased with this camera at really high ISOs.  It was awesome at 3200.  And focusing...  My 20D, 30D, 40D and so forth seemed to take sharper pictures (and I always used L glass).  I seemed to have to struggle with this camera to get really sharp images.  I reached a point where I was afraid to use it on paid shoots because I never knew what I was going to get.The 7D is an awesome camera when you can get it to work (and yea, I read the manual cover to cover a few times).  But I shouldn't have to fight with my camera to get it to do its job.Maybe I had a defective model.

You get some gold simply holding the shutter release down and seeing what you capture.It's also great in low light conditions. Even with the ISO amped up, photos are still nice.Probably one of my favourite things apart from the speed is the 18 MP. It eats up storage on my hard drive, but you can crop considerably before the photo quality starts to suffer. I can't afford a telephoto lens yet, so this comes in kind of handy.

The price, megapixels and frames per second were the selling points for me. I use my 70-200, 2.8 L lens with it.Focus - This is a very fast camera good for sports, which is why I got it. At first I really contemplated returning it because the focus was poor. I thought having a gazillion autofocus points would be a good thing, but it was always focusing on the wrong thing as my main subject moved, redndering most shots useless. I primarily shoot horse racing, which has a wide variety of lighting and movement from the horses walking in the sun in the paddock to running on the shadow-covered track. When I changed the focus to zone AF and/or AF point expansion, it was much better and is almost always focused on the correct part of the picture.Grain - ISO of 3200 or above gets very grainy, worse than my 40D, but it's better at getting a sharp action photo in the darker conditions. I'd rather have a sharp, grainy photo than a blurry, smooth photo, but that's just my preference.Video - I've never used the video feature because it's difficult to focus (no autofocus). It's also difficult to hand-hold the camera with a heavy lens on the front, unlike video cameras that you can hold on the side with a strap around your hand. The HD picture quality is very nice, but shooting is challenging unless you use a tripod or lightweight lens, which then limits what you can shoot.Mode Dial - When I need to quickly switch the camera on for an unexpected photo op, I often unknowingly turn the mode dial and then take a bad picture because of that. Usually I accidentally switch it from my Custom 1 to Bulb, which then makes a completely white photo. It's bad placement for the on/off switch. On my 40D, the on/off is at the bottom-right corner of the LCD screen, and does not conflict with the mode dial on the top.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too Many reviews (they all pretty much say the same thing)", "Author": "7sevens49yrs", "ReviewID": "R3PF7T3ORR7JXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hope this may help a prospective buyer.  I remember my first big buy years ago the canon 2Ae, I was going for the Nikon that was in the same class as the Canon 2Ae. Nikon was double the prize compared the Canon's simi pro version. Being an college student I went for the cheaper version, Canon. It turn out be one of the best investments. It was loaded with tons of features and the camera did stuff I didn't think was possible. I got amazing picture from that camera. It was well worth it, I got more then my money worth.  I feel the same way again about Canon 7D.  Canon has done it again. It is definatelly a game changer in the DSLR war of competition.  this Camera is more then a Simi-pro, it has lots of feature that give the user more control and customize to his or her preference in how they will use it.  Mind you it sound scarey with so many feature, yet I didn't need to read the manual to figure it out except for a few advance features.  The Other area of concern I read about was high ISO setting which I found work great up to 3200 which is very high. However it works best with canon lens to get the high iso quality images. This brings me to another point I want to address.  There are so many mixed reviews and it was really hard to decide.  One thing that helps, is you have to find a reputible web sights that use a more objective reviews.  One Sight I highly recommend is Photozone.  A couple years ago someone sold me on sigma lens and even told me that there were minut difference in len quality comparison with Nikon and Canon that the human eye would not be able to decern.  Well one thing was right Sigma does make some good quality lens compare to some low end brands out their.  I even got rid of all those cheap brand lens cause non of them match the quality of Sigma.  Only now I have I found after doing some test on the canon 7D comparing canon angainst Sigma it was far more sharper and I was able to go higher ISO. Higher quality lens make all the difference.  Take a look at Photozone which is a good place to find good reviews.  SO for those who complain that theirs is not sharp enough check out your lens.

I kept the 7D.I got manuals on all three from the same author, and was using high end Canon \"L\" wide and telephoto zoom lenses and Nikon ED high end lenses.Conclusions:I loved the full frame sensor (35mm sized sensor) in both the D800 and 5D.I saw no practical difference in photo quality between the D800's 36mp and the Canon's 22mp.There was also no practical difference (if you're not enlarging to extreme sizes)between these two and the Canon 7D.I love Canon's intuitive controls and that \"big wheel\" Quick Control Dial.The Canon 7D's menu is very easy to read (there's never more in a particular \"tab\" than what will fit in the rear LCD (so you don't have to scroll down thru choices)The 7D has a very useful built in flash (pop-up flash), that also can be used as a master flash (to control other \"slave\" flashes).Both Canon's were faster at acquiring focus (I was using a Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L & Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 ED lens - both are $2,000 + lenses).All three cameras have built in sensor cleaning (although in reality you will probably have to clean the sensor sooner or later).The Nikon D800 and Canon 7D have pop up flashes. No Canon model higher than the 7D has one.(This one item meant a lot to me because a pop up flash can be used to highlight during a \"daylight\" photo and you always have a flash with you, instead of having to lug a separate SpeedLite flash with you-even the small Canon 90EX or 270EX still needs separate batteries and fills your pocket).Negatives: 1.6x cropped sensor (although if you use a Canon 10-22mm EFS lens, it's the same focal width as the Canon 17-35mm L lens).I did not test the \"movie\" modes of each camera, as I am not experienced in that area, but all the cameras seemed to have very good quality video when displayed on a Sony 55\" LCD TV.Best positive was the price: I paid $1,149 on a special Amazon.com and Canon promotional period just last month.The Nikon and Canon 5D's are around 2 1/2 times as expensive (body only).I don't think anyone could go wrong with either a Nikon or Canon, so Nikonians, please, no \"hate mail\"!Both are great camera companies. If I were a previous Nikon DSLR user, I may have went with the D800, but the Nikon D800 was just too confusing for me to try and learn a whole new way of adjusting & choosing options.Menus take more time to scroll thru, but are fairly easy to use.Dedicated buttons are quicker to access, but you have to learn and remember what each button does.Canon uses more menu choices, while Nikon seemed to be on the \"button heavy\" side.Final word: Buy the best lenses you can afford.

I have a 70-200mm lens and when it is mounted on the 7D, it just works.  I love the grooves on the grip of this camera and because I have somewhat large hands, I can definitely handle heavy lenses without attaching a battery grip, unlike the T1i.Even though I have not put the auto-focus system completely to the test, so far, I really appreciate how you can customize the auto-focus to change depending on whether you are shooting horizontally or vertically.  That feature right there has already saved me precious time in recent shoots.  I can't wait to test out the 8fps!  Let alone, with the shooting speed of this camera, I can handhold a lot more HDR images.  I also appreciate the 19 points that I have to focus.  It's been a little hard shooting with the T1i now as it only has 9 points.The greatest benefit to me has been the Speedlite Transmitter that comes with the built-in flash.  I have a 580 and a 430, and thanks to the Speedliter's Handbook: Learning to Craft Light with Canon Speedlites by Syl Arena, my flash game has accelerated to new levels because of this feature.  I still have somewhat of a hard time with the flashes having to be within the line of sight of the camera, but I'll manage fine for now.  It works flawlessly in-doors though.Overall, this camera is great.  Sorry if I got too technical with the benefits of this camera, but this camera just works!  If you are just starting as a photographer, or if you are an enthusiast like myself, you won't go wrong with this purchase.

Like a $200K sports car, you don't get the most out of it if you're rolling on bargain rubber. Same with a camera -- the glass makes it or breaks it. I will be talking about L-glass only in this review. If you're not interested in L-glass, you may still find it useful.FOCAL RANGEUnless you're a dedicated landscape or interior photographer, I find the L-glass selection of standard zoom lenses pointless if you have a full-frame camera like the 5D. They are just too wide for general purpose. Even the 24-105mm f/4L, if viewed on the 5D, looks like the equivalent of a mere 65mm on a 1.6x crop sensor like the 7D. I find that approximately 70mm on a 1.6x is the equivalent to what your naked eye sees. To get the same effect on a 5D, you need at least 112mm. The problem is, at that length, large-aperture L-glass starts at 70mm, so you're losing your wide angle capability.PERFORMANCE IN LOW LIGHT (HIGH ISO)Large-aperture glass should always be your first weapon, and consider ISO your \"Plan B\". This is where it gets interesting. The 5D performs better than the 7D at high ISO due to its full-frame sensor. But lets look at our lens choices. For standard zoom, we have the 24-70mm F/2.8L and 24-105 F/4L. Remember our little issue about focal range? If I want to combat the \"too wide\" issue of the 5D and upgrade to the 24-105mm F/4L, I'm losing a full F-stop. So even though the 5D performs better in low light, I'm getting more light onto the sensor with a F/2.8 mounted on a 7D. In other words, I've leveled the technology playing field and both cameras are producing nearly the same quality of image right now. Except the 5D MkII costs $700 more (!)CONCLUSIONI can think of only one type of person who would receive an advantage with a 5D MkII -- someone who needs to shoot in low light often (without a tripod) and owns BOTH a 24-70mm F/2.8L AND 70-200mm F/2.8L. Anything slower and you're defeating the purpose of a 5D. Considering the newer technology in the 7D (which I didn't even touch on), the 7D is clearly the most practical for most folks and WAY better bang for buck.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon 7D, the camera that should'a been AWSOME but was only good.", "Author": "ShadeOgray", "ReviewID": "R29AUAQCB4XQ1U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Lots of features but the photo quality always seems...lacking, not as sharp as it should be especially at higher ISO settings.

Shooting stills is really enjoyable and video is equally awesome. It is quite astonishing to see what the 7D can do when shooting on HD.I only have two problems with this camera: 1 - I can't record more than 12 minutes a time on full HD, and my second problems is that, as any DSLR, the 7D is not really a camera meant for handheld video recording. Video is too shaky without a firm and stable support.That's it! After that, I have no other issues.The rugged look and feel of the 7D is one of the characteristic that I like the most.

Of course, it wasn't Antarctica but to me --a dude from a Caribbean island-- that was a little extreme.

When I started using it, I was so disappointed. My images were flat and soft. There was no wow factor at all. I was shocked. So I went on line and looked up the problem, to my surprise, so many people were finding the same problems, soft images and trouble with Auto Focus. Looked up all sorts of things to do to correct it, tried it all, and still , soft images. I refused to give in. I kept trying and trying as I wanted so much to love my 7D. Sadly, in the end, I could not love it, it was giving me such stress and disappointment. I had bought my husband a Sony NEX-5N and gave that to him for Christmas and he was getting better images on that than I was on my 7D. So many people stated that they had to send theirs to canon for calibration 4 X or more, I did not spend $1400.00 to keep sending this back to Canon. Soft images seem to be an ongoing problem with a lot of peoples 7D's. In the end I had to send it back, putting in that box was so so sad. I went to a local NYC camera store and picked up a T3I instead, I came home and was getting the most awesome shots ever. I also have the T1I and this also is giving me better shots than the 7D. This is so sad and so disappointing and I love Canon but I can not understand for the life of me what the deal is with this 7D. The next one which is the 5D, I was hesitant to buy as the price is approx $900.00 more than the 7D and I was afraid I would have similar circumstances. My TI models never failed me yet and I guess I will stick with them. Do your homework before buying a 7D, look up focusing problems on the net before you buy. Amazon is GREAT about returns which made this easy. Still so sad and so let down  :-(  Bear in mind, that I am an experienced photographer with multiple Canon L - Series lenses which were all used on the 7D with the same soft image results.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's great... except for the pictures it makes.", "Author": "Marshall Pierce", "ReviewID": "RZ16KWG567YCI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The one I got had a squeaky CF door. I noticed it the very first time I picked it up; it was that obvious. After doing some reading online, it appears this is a common (but not universal) build problem. I considered exchanging it before I'd gotten much further unpacking, but thought I might as well shoot with it for a weekend to see how it performed compared to my trusty 40D. (For what it's worth, the 40D's door is rock solid and has absolutely no \"give\" to it.)I shot an autocross event in light varying from full sun to mild cloud cover. Exposures were typically around 1/2000 at f/2.8 ISO 100, so there was plenty of light. I used a 70-200mm f/2.8L IS (not the new second-generation one, though) on the 7D and a 300mm f/4L on my 40D. Both cameras were set to record raw files and were processed in Lightroom 2.6.Pluses:- Drastically better color rendition for certain shades. One of the cars at the autocross was a BMW M3 in Phoenix Yellow, a particularly awful shade of yellow-green. The 7D got it almost exactly right. The 40D rendered it as more of a dull dusty yellow with almost no green to it. The colors were so far apart that at first I thought they were different cars when I was going through the frames afterwards.- AF was improved over the 40D. I used the AF mode that uses one AF point plus its vertical and horizontal neighbors and that worked pretty well tracking quickly moving cars. I wouldn't call its accuracy a dramatic improvement over the 40D for this particular style of shooting, but it's definitely better.- The grip was a marginal improvement for my large hands. I think it would be more of an improvement for smaller hands.- Big, bright viewfinder.- The main LCD screen is great, even in bright sun.- The new button layout and button \"feel\" is nice. Bigger buttons are easier to work with in gloves, though that wasn't an issue on this particular day.- The electronic level seems pretty sensitive. I'm not sure how useful it will be, but there it is. I haven't had much trouble getting my horizons level without an electronic level.- 1080p video is nice, but I don't have the audio equipment to make good use of it. Don't think that getting a camera that shoots 1080p will turn you into a videographer overnight.- Aside from the squeaky door, the body feels pleasantly heavy and very solid.Minuses:- Significantly grainier images than the 40D, even at ISO 100. I was shocked at how bad the grain was. After seeing how bad the noise was, I immediately packed up the camera to return it. The noise is simply atrocious.- Pixel for pixel, the 7D is a little softer than the 40D. This is well known; see other online reviews of the 7D.So there you have it. It's a great camera to use as long as you never intend to look at the pictures it takes (or don't have very high standards). Maybe the one I got was defective... who knows. I'm waiting for the next generation of bodies.Update:Take a look at a full-size shot: [...] (Amazon censors URLs in reviews. See the comments for how to access the sample images.)Make sure to view it at 100%. As stated above in the review, the 7D does have very good color rendition, so don't hold the muted colors in this shot against it. This shot was converted with ufraw which doesn't have good color defaults for the 7D. Lightroom 2.6 renders colors accurately with the default camera profiles (though Lightroom's raw conversions also exhibit the same noise, so that's not just from ufraw). The side panels of the car are especially easy to see noise in.", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "replacement fixed it all!", "Author": "IDH", "ReviewID": "R533X4M4L1A8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received camera today and initial impression is good, but........the main dial is not working correctly.  When it is rotated, the associated function lags, or does not respond at all. The multi-controller button is also a bit unresponsive in the \"up\" direction. Over 500 shots with it already. Noisy at ISO above 400 (much more so than my 50D). Sharp at lower ISO settings. The three stars is warranted at this point considering Canon has let a bum unit past QC and the noisy high ISO performance. This is a disappointment considering the great performance of my 50D. I'll update this section when the replacement from Amazon arrives next week.Update (11/11/2009):The replacement body arrived and the problems with the controls are no longer an issue.  This one feels tight, and the main dial is responsive like it should be. In fact, all the controls and dials feel tighter than on my 50D.Is it worth the upgrade?  I thought so as I'm looking to add sports photography to my portfolio.  The camera's 8fps is FAST, and the AF in conjunction with the AI Servo mode works well capturing moving subjects. I can grab 15 RAWS before any noticeable slow down as the buffer fills.  If capturing in JPEG mode, it seems to go on forever (using 8GB Sandisk Extreme III, not UDMA compatible).It is not significantly larger or heavier than the 50D (except for the noticeable bulge around the viewfinder). The 100% viewfinder stops the guess work associated with framing your subject and lets in a lot of light.  As multiple AF points illuminate in the viewfinder though, you get a red \"haze\" across the image field which grows in intensity as more points are illuminated (this does not affect the captured image). This is a bit distracting.  The multi-function button next to the shutter makes adjusting the AF points a cinch. The AF point expansion is a great option when you want to control the focus point, but risk getting off subject when the subject is moving quickly.The shutter is quieter than the 50D's. The build quality seems a bit more hearty than the 50D. I can feel a very small amount of play in the lens mount on the 50D with heavier lenses attached such as the 70-200 f/2.8 IS. The lens mount on the 7D is very snug, and no play is evident.The ability to see grid lines and the multi axis level through the viewfinder is a great option that helps immensely with getting orientation right the first time.  Less image rotation later in Photoshop.The LCD brightness is a bit dim in auto mode, but that can be changed to a manual setting with little effort. The LCD looks a bit smaller on the 7D, but this is due to the presence of a black border around the 50D LCD which has been removed on the 7D.The ability to use the RC-1 remote is nice addition which was a missing feature in my opinion in the 50D, as well as the ability to control off camera flashes with the integrated Speedlight transmitter.  I was using a 580EX II on camera to control a 430EX II off camera, but now I can use both off camera when needed without cords or expensive radio controllers.The Auto Lighting Optimizer seems a bit more noticeable when at the default setting than with the 50D.  For those times when you want or need to underexpose slightly, this can render the image too bright.  It can be set to a lower setting or turned off in the menu.Another small change that might not matter if you don't use a battery grip (or do use one but never take it off) is how the battery door attaches to the body. On the 50D, the battery door has two arms that snap into flexible plastic clips. The 7D has non flexing slots and a spring loaded arm on the door itself.  Why does this matter?  If you alternate between using the battery grip (portraits, sports, etc..) and not using it (for the weight advantage of walking around all day) the idea of taking the battery door on and off is less worrisome.  When plastic flexes it weakens and can break. The spring loaded arm on the 7D battery door is a great idea.Using Canon's 100mm f/2.8 USM macro lens, I was able to capture some of the sharpest handhled images I have ever taken. I've seen one ISO 12233 chart that purports to give the sharpness advantage to the 50D, but I don't see that in practice.My initial impression is that this is the best crop sensor camera Canon has made to date.

The extra battery is great because this camera will required you to use a lot of flash so it uses a lot of power, and the standard flash that attached to the camera is only good for close-up-shot (within 5 to 7 feet), and so you will probably need to buy a flash for this camera. You would probably take a lot of pictures with this camera so you probably have to buy 2 CF cards instead of 1. I recommend the Duracell High Speed because they are cheapest when compared to similar size and speed.

The 7D is no where near the best camera Canon has made and, in fact, I would say it is probably one of the worst bodies they've made, excepting that the camera does excel on the video end.  There is significant noise beyond ISO 800, although the files are still usable, but ISO 3200 is the absolute limit.  This is a very antiquated camera now when you consider that the newer sensors on a camera like the 5D Mark III will shoot clean files in excess of ISO 12000.  The files from the 40D were just as good, if not better than the 7D.I had one of the early 7Ds and I can attest to the serious problems that the early cameras had with sharpness and focus.  I got rid of that body a couple years ago.  After the recent price drop I decided to give it another shot and bought a new recently manufactured body.  While it appears that the sharpness issues had been resolved, for the most part, even the newer makes are mostly unimpressive.  Focus on this camera when tracking moving subjects is still sub-par.  When shooting a typical sporting event it is not uncommon to get a 50% in-focus burst when the subject is moving towards you). The center point focus is really the only one that is usable for moving subjects as none of the other focus setting can produce consistently in-focus shots of moving subjects, including the center-point expansion setting.  Contrary to what some have proclaimed, the focus system is not so advanced that is difficult for the user to find the right settings, it is just that this camera's focusing system is simply not very good for moving subjects.  In fact, I found that the 9-point focus system on the 40d and 5DmkII, respectively, were just about as good as the 7d's for moving objects.  Of course, neither of those cameras fps are close to the 7D's so for sports they were not viable alternatives.This camera has probably been Canon's most hyped body and for those that had the mistaken impression (like me) that is was a viable and dependable backup to your 1D series camera it has been a complete bust.  If you think this is a great body then that's fine since it is your opinion but I really think the only person that could objectively say that this is a great camera is someone that has never shot with a higher performance camera.  I would take a used 1DmkII over this camera every day of the week.That being said, Canon is producing some amazing camera now, such as the 5DmkIII, which is worth every penny in my opinion.  It's a little slow in fps for some sports action but given that the focusing system is incredibly good I would say that I get many more in-focus shots from it then with 7D and almost as many than with the 1DmkIV, even though that camera shoots almost twice as many fps.Let's hope that Canon does not release the 7dmkII with all of the noise problems the 7D has.  If it's a 1.6x crop then you can't expect it to be as good as a 5D or 1D but it has to be significantly improved in relation to original 7D or I can't buy it.  Given that the 1D cameras have all gone to \"full crop\" senors my suggestion to Canon would be to adopt the 1.3x cropped used in the previous 1Ds.Given current technology advances this camera is well out dated for a serious shooter.  If you're enthusist then have at it but if you need to depend on a camera to help you make money, this is not the most dependable camera.  If the 7dII is able to adopt the focus system of the 5DmkIII and at least borrow some of the clean file technology up to, say ISO 8000, then the new camera will be a winner, if not, the 7dII will be every bit the dog that the 7d is for more advance and professional shooters (my apologies to dogs for the insult).", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "7D", "Author": "Stan", "ReviewID": "R2339YQLH9I4A3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera.

Leon \"LeoDC\"", "ReviewID": "R6OAY4Y4SXEIV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like my 7D and its pro-features but when comparing with the 50D Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) I have second thoughts about the price difference.Here's a quick comparison between the 7D and the 50D:- Both cameras are compatible with EF and EF-S lenses- ISO 100-6400 (expandable to 12800) -beyond 1600 ISO you get the same noise- AF point coverage area is the same- Same self-cleaning system- Same 3 inches LCD monitor (0.92 million dots)- The 50 D is lighter than the 7D (25.7 oz/730g versus 28.9 oz./820g)- Nineteen-point AF system versus nine-point in the 50D (in my experience, more AF points don't translate into sharper images or better subject focus)- 100% viewfinder in the 7D versus 95% in the 50D- 8 frames per second versus 6.5 frames per second in the 50D (unless you shoot high-speed sports such as car racing it's hard to tell the value of this is)- The 7D provides 2.9 more megapixels than the 50D. But when comparing the quality of the pictures (18 versus 15.1 megapixels) it's really hard to see substantial differences -also the cropping factor is nominal. On the other hand, storing 2.9 extra megapixels per picture require LOTS and LOTS more memory.The question is: is it worth to pay $700 bucks more for the extra-features below of the 7-D?1) Built-in Speedlite Transmitter (useful if you planning to shoot with additional Canon 580 or 430 series flashes remotely. Note this is NOT a transmitter that will work with studio lighting)Canon STE2 Speedlite Transmitter for Canon 580EX II, 430EX, 430EX II Speedlites2) Dust/weather-resistant body versus the 50D partial dust/weather sealing3) Dual-Axis Electronic Level4) HD movie capability -not available in the 50D. However, note that filming with a DSRL has many limitations such as: heavy vibration, editing compatibility issues, poor sound quality, image blurriness (AF lenses don't work when movie is on)5) Shutter durability. The 7D has 150,000 versus the 50D 100,000. But how many shots would you take in a year? I take about 25,000 a year which is a lot. That means that I'd have shutter for about 4 years in the 50D and 5 years in the 7D. The question here is how many years until this camera is dated? Canon lifecycle is about 2 to 3 years. For example, the 50D was released on October 2008 and there is a new 60D expected for May 2010.In conclusion, I'm not totally convinced that the 7D is worth the $700 hundred extra bucks but it's really your call, and if $$$ is no object for you, invest the money in classes before investing in expensive gear like this one.I'd have given four stars to the 7D -but because its value for the money I'm giving just two stars.-----------------One more thing about what you get for your dinero.The new 2010 Rebel Canon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only) borrows many of the 7D pro-features as follow:- 18.0 Megapixel CMOS sensor- ISO 100-6400 (expandable to 12800)- 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system- Full HD movie capabilitiesI have to acknowledge that the Rebel is a \"prosumer\" camera, with a plastic surface that feels cheap and looks cheap.

WHen I received it and paired it with my 17-55 f.28 USM, I immediately took some snapshots around the house and outside. Everything was out of focus. Clearly I had something set up incorrectly right? No. I'm an experienced photographer and know how to work a camera. I only use spot focus or single point focus on still subject, which are what I mostly shoot. It seemed that my camera was front focusing. The farther away subjects were, the more the camera front focused. Or was it? It seems that some photos backfocused, front focused, and on occasion would somewhat nail focus but the pictures still appeared soft. Yes- my shutter speed was more than high enough to avoid camera shake or motion blur. In fact, some of thse photos were indoors using flash. Maybe my lens was out of adjustment? I ended up finding that a +15 microadjustment helped SOME of the time, however at different focal lengths, subject to camera distances, and even if you took a few shots of the same subject at the same distance, the autofocus was different in every photo. I then tried my 17-55 on my friends t2i. Spot on, every time, every distance, at every aperture. Houston, we have a problem. Not to mention it is then that I noticed that with identical settings (tested with evaluative and spot metering to the same exposure level), my 7d is also underexposing pictures by almost a full stop compared to the T2i my friend has. I looked up these issues online and that was when I found out that there are many other people having both of these exact problems. \"random focus\" and underexposure. My 7d is currently at the newport news service center...only time will tell if they return it in a usable state. From what I have read of others experiences, I will most likely receive the camera with the same problems. I don't doubt that there are some excellent 7d's out there, but be aware that there ARE a lot of lemons out there. I was lucky enough to get one, and you might be too.Another note: the noise at low iso's is terrible. My t2i put out much cleaner files, strangely though because they share a similar sensor.The fact that canon let this camera through quality control and it ended up on a store shelf gets it a one star review.

However, there in lies the problem.If I use the 19-point zone AF, EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' SHOT is out of focus.

It is indeed a great camera, that I've compared with other less expensive versions of canc and it really stands out. I won't be giving much technical input here but wanted to give you some information on one problem I had.I noticed some time after buying it that the on/off switch was a little tight without any accident happening to the camera. Probably this issue was there since the very beginning but I noticed this some time after ... so I didn't worry too much... until this summer. I was up in the mountains in Spain when I noticed that the dial mode switch was starting to become loose (not firm) ... some hours latter when shooting and changing modes the dial mode switch detached from the camera, it broke completely. To my stupefaction it was just a regular plastic switch with a plastic stem that just broke. I really wasn't expecting this to be made out of plastic in a 7D. Anyways hopefully it was stuck in aperture mode and I could still use the camera (partially) ...Some months latter I went to canon to have it fixed (it was out of warranty so I had to pay ~100$). I also asked to have it replaced with the lock-build-in version of the dial mode (this was in France where I live). Not being a CPS member they don't take you very seriously and they had my problem fixed 3 weeks after when the maximum delay shouldn't have been more than 10 days for non CPS. I'm a little upset with this since I really needed my camera and them keeping their delays.Anyways just wanted to let you know that this is made out of plastic and that if you feel the on/of button is unusually firm go to have it fixed while it is still covered by warranty.

I am also not the most knowledgeable about all things technical when it comes to cameras. I am writing this more from the perspective of hobbyists who are considering upgrading their camera and are on the fence about choosing the camera. Professionals please ignore this.I recently upgraded to this camera after using a Canon Rebel T1i for several years. Clearly I was upgrading from an entry level DSLR, so the step up was significant for me. I wanted to make sure I could use my older lenses and not have to buy everything from scratch. After using it for a few weeks, here is what I LOVE:1) This is the fastest camera I've had - I am amazed at how fast the multiple exposures for a HDR shot come in. I also have been taking a lot of moving shots and it's really smooth2) The controls are intuitive and fairly easy to understand. If you've used Canon before, the dials look familiar. Having said that, please don't plan on starting a project as you take this out of the box - it does take a little getting used to3) The EF-S lenses all works. This means if you're upgrading from a Canon DSLR, you DON'T have to invest in new lenses straight away. For budget hobbyists like me, that was a big selling point4) The BULB exposure setting was a significant step up for me - my old camera wasn't very good with BULB exposuresI am not going to go into technical details and AF points and those kinds of pros and cons. There are enough qualified reviewers writing about those, and try to look at the online manuals if you are so inclined.A couple of caveats for the naive buyers like me - there are a bunch of accessories you DO have to upgrade:1) Since I was upgrading from the lowest level DSLR, I didn't have CF card in my old camera. It was a shock to me when my new camera arrived and I couldn't use my usual SD card. Make sure you get a good quality CF and CF card reader with the camera. If you're upgrading from a 60D or 50D, you know what a CF is, so ignore this point2) The 7D uses a different batter from the entry level DSLRs (LP E6 - my old camera had LP E5). You get a new battery and charger in the box, but if you have a battery pack and grip for your old camera, it isn't going to workI think at ~$1250 this is an excellent buy.

I uploaded the photos to my Mac. The photos looked awesome. crisp, and bright. After a while I wanted to take some low light shots, mainly because I knew the wedding reception would be held in a dark area with minimal light. I bumped the ISO to 250 then 320, then 500. Shooting random pics of my kids in my darker living room at night. Holy noise!!! Even at 250 ISO with my 50mm f1.4 it's unacceptable. I was mortified but I had the wedding coming up in a few days. In a nutshell, my reception photos were complete crap! grainy and noisy. I was able to fix a few using Lightroom 3's improved noise reduction but even then they looked like paintings because it over compensates. I talked to the camera store I purchased it from and they said they have never heard of the noise problems, and that I should bring in some examples. forget about even shooting at 800 ISO let alone 1600 and higher.

The 50D was great, but it was lacking something for me, and I wanted video, so I sold it and purchased a 7D (over a 5Dii due to better AF).There's no doubt this camera just \"fits\" in my hands better. My brother has my old Rebel now, and it feels so tiny and delicate compared to the 7D. IQ was a marginal upgrade over the 50D, but I've found the low light performance to be better - I can generally get acceptable images up to ISO3200 with properly exposed images, sometimes even 6400.Where this camera blows me away is in its custom settings and AF. I feel like there's so much more to this camera that I haven't explored yet - video, the options for AF, and just overall the higher number of custom functions over the 50D.Where this camera is it blowing me away is with metering. No matter which metering method I use, the camera will never get it right within 2/3 stop. I've found that without flash I have to go + 2/3 - 1 1/3 stop, and without flash about - 2/3 to 1 stop.

I timed my order with a variety of other items to complement the camera, IE a bag, lens cleaner etc by ordering one day shipping.  Unfortunately, in my research, I decided to get her the 28-135 lens instead of the 18-135 based on a few things, the 28 being newer, compatible with full frame cameras (use on her upgrade in 2 years), reports of crisper/cleaner shots, Ultra Sonic focusing/Image stabilization.  In most people's eyes, the 28 is a better lens.  The 18 allows for a more macro/small space picture though and we've already noticed a few shots that could have used an 18... oh well.  Any who, Amazon shipped the 18 to us by mistake.  So even with the one day shipping, it took 4 days for the correct camera to get to us.  Amazingly, it still arrived before mother's day and was a fine surprise for her.  We have taken almost 2k pictures with this since then.  One thing to think about though is that SLR cameras have a moving mirror etc that is only good for a certain number of movements.  I'm wondering if maybe we should have bought a T3i to practice and the 7D later to take the good shots...  So far money WELL spent.

This camera has produced high quality photos and we have been more than satisfied with the images and even video taken with it.  Reliability, however, has been a real problem for us with this model.  We own 2 other Canon digital SLRs, several EF lenses and 3 Canon PowerShot cameras and this is the first product where we believe product reliability has been a problem.  We bought the camera in late 2010 and the problems didn't crop up until early 2012 when the camera was out of warranty. Periodically we would get an error 20 which required us to remove the battery and reinsert. Although annoying, we got used to the periodic error and process for removing/reinserting the battery.  By April 2012, removing and reinserting the battery stopped correcting the problem and I figured out that if I switched the camera from photo to video mode (and back), that the camera operated fine again for several days or even weeks before seeing the error 20 message again.  We had a big trip to Peru coming up, but the camera was out of warranty so I decided that I could live with this workaround for the summer and that I would send the camera in once our travel slowed down for the fall as it usually does.  On day 3 of our trip which was the day before we were to begin hiking the Inca Trail, the camera simply died.  No error codes, no message of any kind.  I had spare batteries, lenses, CF cards and no combination of swaps resulted in a message of any kind.  I took everything to a Canon dealer in Cuzco and confirmed that all of my components worked fine with their display 7D eliminating the possibility of the problem being with anything but the body.  Unfortunately, the closest Canon service center was in Lima and they were not guaranteeing a turn around of less than 7 days which wouldn't work for our travel agenda so we chunked the camera into the luggage and used our PowerShot for the rest of the trip.  I know, shame on me for not having a backup body but in our defense we are not \"serious\" photographers and we've never encountered a problem like this before with a Canon product so we didn't have prior experience to draw upon.  When we got back to the US, I tried the camera at home and to my surprise was met with an error 40 message when I turned the camera on.  Having looked at various camera forums and blog sites I've noticed that many others have experienced either the error 20 problem (mechanical) or error 40 problem (power) as I have and it turns out I'm not the first to have a trip to Peru impacted by an error 40 problem.To Canon's credit, I sent the body to Canon Service in Virginia where they promptly repaired and returned the unit.

Anyone who has shot with one of these can tell you that Canon is at the forefront of technology that is revolutionizing how images are taken and how movies are made. I use mine mostly for video shooting. If you've never used a DSLR for shooting video, get ready to be blown away.  Having said this, there are 3 major drawbacks you should be aware of:1. Lack of Full-size sensor.  For a $1600 price tag (body only), I really feel like this camera should have a full-sized sensor; it doesn't. The images and footage are still incredible, but if you're looking for a camera that will produce larger prints at incredible quality - you might want to look on to the 5D (Mark II, III, or IV).2. Limited filming time. The 7D has an auto shut-off at around 15 minutes or so when shooting in movie mode.  This means if you are planning on using this for anything but capturing shorter clips, you'll have to quickly acclimate yourself to watching the clock while you shoot.3. Overheating. If you're planning on shooting in warmer areas (traveling to much warmer climates/indoor with incandescent lights) you may run into overheating issues.  It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it could shut down your shoot for 5-10 minutes while the camera cools down.  I'm not sure if this is an issue with other DSLRs when shooting in movie mode or not, but I've ran into this on about 4 occasions.  Considering I've logged around 400 hours of shooting time with this thing, I can't really complain; it just freaks you out the first time it happens.All in all, if the rebel t3i was available when I bought the 7D, I could've probably settled for the t3i for half the price.  Don't get me wrong, the 7D camera is great.

I compared the picture quality with my x1i and 50D by using the same lenses (Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8, EF 85mm f/1.8, and EF 50mm f/1.8), and it was much faster to focus with the previous ones and also got much sharper and brighter pictures.I just feel myself very unfortunate to get this malfunctioning unit and won't generalize my problem to the model.

It definitely has the heated seats, the back supports and the nice radio etc.  The controls are smooth and easy to use and the options are very nice and detailed. Way too much probably for any  casual shooter.  I have not had any focusing issues so far, even though I read this is a common problem. In fact, I now have a new respect for my 28-135mm lens that I was ready to trash that came with the 50d. On the 7d it is TACK sharp. I had even calibrated it for the 50d and still did not get results like the 7d straight out of the box. Honestly though, I have not really had time yet to put all the autofocus options to work. I like to be picky about which part of the photo is in focus, so I often just use the center sensor and then move frame the shot once focused. However, I shoot a lot of sports and I have yet to see how this thing tracks.After many hours of test shots and reading online it comes down to this for me.  Picture quality.  Is the picture quality reeeaallllyy better than the 50d? Or even a much less expensive and older model Rebel? It may not be. And that my friends is the kicker. There is definitely noise even at ISO as low as 400.  I can get this out with Adobe raw and/or slightly overexposing the image.  But, do I really want to do this on a $1,500 body?  IMHO, i think this issue will cause a lot of serious enthusiasts to switch to Nikon and I might have too if I didn't have a nice collection of Canon lenses already. I decided to keep the 7d so far and will be getting into my RAW and focus tracking testing this weekend. ( I have a real job you know)  Honestly, if you don't need 8 frames per second, (which I do) I would go with the Rebel T3i and save a pocketful. I will update after the upcoming tests.UPDATE JANUARY 2012:  I have been shooting this camera for several months now and have found it quite nice. I do seem to occasionally have some issues with focusing that I havent sorted out yet. I think the biggie thing with this camera is the noise. You hear a lot about it and I complained above. My latest thoughts. There is almost some sort of \"baseline\" noise that you will see even at very low ISO. But, really, it is not noticeably worse at higher ISO\"S like 2500-3500 which is about as far as I have taken it for use. A minimal amount of  luminance reduction in post processing and you have a camera that shoots professionally at least up to 3500 ISO.

I use a 1D MKIII that I have just received back from Canon after the third repair for Autofocus - fixed this time. I purchased the 7D not as a backup but to replace my 1D MKIII due to the Autofocus issues I was having - I would go to the MK IV later if everything was kosher with it, but now that my 1D MKIII was fixed to my satisfaction I will keep it. But back to the 7D. Love the Camera, great LCD, great speed, AI servo autofocus is spot on, flash control from the pop up flash, cheap wireless remote can be used, great pictures. The 1D does not have a great LCD, no flash control from the camera itself, and a dedicated expensive wireless remote is needed, Better speed and better pictures from the 1D MK III though.I am sending my 7D back, for just couple of reasons that are biggies for me.1. File size is tremendous - my computer struggles under the weight of these files. Just too slow for me and having to store these files is a burden. If the picture quality were better it might be a consideration. But the 1D MKIII takes sharper, cleaner pictures at 10mp compared to 18mp. With the 7D you have to purchase large memory cards and only have space for 1 on the camera. The 1D MKIII has 2 slots and can store thousands of 10mp pics, big advantage for me.2. I find myself tilting the 7D during sports shots, not all shots but too many for me. I guess it is the size, I never do this with the 1D MKIII.Again I love the 7D - if I didnt take 1200 shots every game I shoot - file size probably wouldnt matter - but for what I do - it is a biggie.The prices for 1D MKIII's are falling due to the MKIV being released and if you can get a good one, this is your best bet if you do sports or wildlife - just great pictures, great controls, great speed. No movies, Bad LCD and proprietary flash and wireless controls. The 1D MKIII is a workhorse and just plain works - very well. ( Very large - but comfortable )I give the 7D a 4 star due to the file size, In my opinion canon should have used a 10-12 megapixel sensor.

I had been trying to decide to add video to photo lineup and when Canon offered the 7D with HD, it appeared both of my needs had been answered.I am disappointed to say, that the video option of the 7D is not much to write home about.  There is no auto-focus or exposure capability.  You basically are entering live vue, press the half shutter to get the initial focus and exposure and then video from there.  If your distance or exposure changes, your only option is to hit the auto-focus button, which has limited succes and travels in and out several times to find a setting.

But I do work with a guy who owns one, and I'm motivated to comment on it.I'm working with a new camera guy on a small, indie film that was shot in the Sacramento area.  I'm doing the behind-the-scenes still photography.  He was shooting that day using a Steadicam, which is a very expensive item.  I'm looking for the pro-sumer camcorder like I've seen many times before.  Instead, he's there with the Canon 7d.  I'm thinking, what is going on?  Why has he popped a still camera on a Steadicam?  But he's shooting the entire film on this!He's been hired to shoot this film, and the deal is is that he brings his own equipment to the shoot.  He told me his still has a few professional camcorders, but the Canon 7d does HD, the quality is excellent, and the camera is inexpensive for what it does.  The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to get this camera.The quality of the photographs he's taken is excellent.  Strikingly good, as a matter of fact.  And the film quality is excellent as well.Now I have nice equipment, both film and digital Nikons, and a Canon camcorder miniDV .  But my Nikon does not shoot HD video.  I don't really shoot video that needs to be superb quality (I mean my cat is cute and all, but...).  So I don't need this camera, since I already have a nice camcorder.  In general, I have too many cameras, period.I will say that if I were in the market for a pro-sumer camera that did two things, and two things very well, I'd definitely by this Canon 7d.  There would be no need to by a separate camcorder. That saves money, potentially a lot of money.For the quality of the photos and the video, the price is extremely reasonable.  My Nikon that shoots pretty much only stills cost me about the same.Very highly recommended.  If you are even thinking about this camera, go out an buy it!  I'd love to purchase this camera.  It kills two birds with one stone, so to say.  I assume this is the direction that many high-end and even medium-range cameras are going in. Less money in the long run, fewer cameras to lug around, fewer tapes and cards to carry.

The choice wasn't easy, as Canon have not continued the XXD series directly. The 50D is now two years old. Instead of a 60D, last year Canon introduced the 7D. This is more like a cross between the 40D and the 5D MkII, and is rather more expensive, but at least it's compatible with my ES-F lenses, so after some umming and ahhing that's what I decided upon.Now before I get to the negative bit, let's acknowledge that the 7D is a very good camera. It does well all the things that other Canons do well, and I have great hopes for the advanced auto-focus, although I haven't yet found anything to really test that. I also really like the built-in level and composition grid, and the much-improved live view features.Low light performance of the new cameras is very good, although the improvement is marginal over the 40D in the crucial (for me) 1600-3200 ISO range. If you want to see what I mean, have a look at the full version of this review on my website.ISO 1600 shots will clean up well, and should make a decent print, the ISO 3200 shot is marginal, and will take some juggling to get a good balance between noise and sharpness. 7D shots at ISOs 6400 and 12800 will never be portfolio quality.The 7D produces good pictures. Its offences are against ergonomics and design purity.First up, weight. The dimensions of the 40D and 7D are almost identical. However, it weighs a whopping 80g more. That's all but 3oz in old money, or a more than 10% increase. Obviously my previous entreaties to Canon to \"just add lightness\" haven't yet borne fruit. There's no good explanation for the increase. Weather sealing has allegedly been improved, but rubber isn't very heavy. Maybe there's a lead weight (or, marginally more realistically, a tube of mercury) swinging around for the level? Whatever the cause, I predict a number of 7D owners becoming tired either directly of the weight, or the blurry images to which it may well lead.Then there are several completely superflous controls, most of which just get in the way. My b\u00e8te noir is the rear control dial lock switch. What's the point of this? If you're such a klutz you can't pick up a camera without randomly twiddling the controls then maybe a high-end Canon isn't for you. And why just lock the RCD and no other controls? It doesn't even lock the RCD fully - the latter can still be used in the menus. Instead it's a needless point of failure - my first 7D had to be returned because this switch had failed, and I have seen several similar cases on the web.Next, the \"multi-function button\", and auto-focus control. Functions carried across from the XXD series have a delightfully consistent logic: press a single button, and then the front control dial sets one aspect, while the RCD sets the other. For example, exposure compensation and bracketing. In most other Canons, AF is similar. Not the 7D. First you press the AF select button as before, then you have to press this fiddly new button next to the shutter release to cycle through the AF modes, and finally you can select an AF zone or point with the RCD. Why not just cycle the AF mode with the front dial, and the detail with the RCD?The \"multi-function button\" isn't well named, as by default it only perform this function and flash exposure lock. However you can, if you ferret around in the custom function menus, assign a much more useful function - triggering the viewfinder display of the level and composition grid. This excellent capability really needs to be enabled by default - why not on the wastebasket button, which falls naturally under the left thumb and otherwise has no function when shooting?The idea of being able to re-assign some buttons is a good one, but very strangely and half-heartedly implemented. For example, I'm never going to use RAW+JPEG button, because I always shoot with that combination anyway. Why can't I assign this to something useful, like mirror lock-up? Yet I can re-assign the shutter half-press to another function (from the absolute SLR standard of \"focus and meter\"), which would be a remarkably contrary thing to do.Finally, what's with the \"reprofiled grip\"? I don't know who Canon reprofiled it for, but it's certainly not men with average sized hands, who now find a painful ridge under the thumb pad where the 40D was fine. At least one 7D is going to have to be modified with rubber tape, and that's not good.So sorry Canon, I can only give the 7D 7/10, and I wanted to love it like its predecessor. You've got the electronics right, now focus on a more consistent, streamlined and comfortable user experience. You know how to do this - just look at the 40D.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Focus issues, but can take some really good photos", "Author": "R. Mcmillin", "ReviewID": "R2VQ23SEWVOCTD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Canon camera, but not my first DSLR.  My first DSLR was the Sony Alpha 100, with a Sigma 18-200mm lens.  I have enjoyed photography for > 40 years, including darkroom work on film, and have really enjoyed it the most with the advent of the digital revolution.  I have been using the 7D for 7 months now, having taken thousands of photos, including a wedding and a couple of events, (for friends or family), trying to make sure my issues aren't due to my lack of familiarity with the camera.Con:  My biggest, and maybe only real gripe is the 19-point auto-focus.  It locks onto the nearest subject, no matter where it is in the frame.  And to make matters worse, the focus indicators can show locking on farther points in addition to the one closest, but they usually aren't in focus when you review the photo, just the closest ones.  I was taking pictures of people on a stage and found the camera focusing on the TV camera to the very far right of the stage, and the people on stage were not quite sharp in focus, even though they took up the majority of the picture.  I took a picture of my backyard, and a small branch from a bush to the very far right of the screen was in sharp focus while the entire backyard was out of focus.  In each case, the focus indicators did not show just these objects being in focus (I keep the focus indicators showing when I review my picture just to confirm where the camera tells me I was focusing).  There are usually several areas with the focus squares indicating focus, but when I review my photos it is usually the object closest to the camera in sharp focus.  The manual even indicates that the camera will normally focus on the closest object, so I wonder what the point is of having 19 focus points?  Seems it should have an AI that would maximize the greatest amount of objects in focus in the picture.  You can make adjustments by cutting down the area of focus (some of which are turned off by default?), but then why have 19 auto-focus points?  Why would the camera think that I would prefer to focus on something to the far side of the screen and not the central area of the picture?  If the area you are taking a picture of is square with the camera, with everything about the same distance from the camera, everything will be in great focus.  But if you are taking a picture where things are at varying distances, such as a U-shaped table with guests sitting around it, expect the people on each end nearest you to be in focus and the middle of the table (farthest away) to be blurred with the 19-point AF.Related to the focus issue, my Sony had a sensor on the eye-cup that started AF whenever you put your eye to they eye-cup, so I never opened my camera eye to a completely blurred screen.  Often when I put the Canon to my eye I can't recognize anything in the image before me.  Of course I just need to press the shutter button halfway and it focuses, but seems that an eye senor option would have been nice on such an expensive camera.  Another advantage of the eye sensor is in keeping the subject focused as you compose the shot and before you finally depress the shutter button.  With the eye senor of the Sony if I moved just a little bit the auto-focus would continue to adjust, which is a big help with hand-held macro shots where just a slight movement can make a big difference.  I know there is a setting for dynamic focus called AI Servo, which is for moving subjects.  I'm not sure how this would work for macro shots, however I tried it for seagulls in flight and it didn't work very well at all.  My Sony did much better for birds in flight, no matter what focus setting I used on the Canon.For those who think I had a bad lens, I have used the Canon 50mm 1.8, Canon 28-135, and Tamron 18-270.  Not the best lenses you will find, but decent enough to not blame the lens solely for these problems.  I now use center-weighted focusing for just about everything, and it works fine most of the time, just need to be thinking exactly where you want to focus to be sure to get what you want out of the shot.Another con is the fact that highlights seems to get blown out far more often than my Sony on high contrast outdoor shots.  But when the exposure is good, which is most of the time, the colors are fantastic.  When using the built in flash outdoors for closeup fill flash it is always overexposed, but you can adjust the flash exposure very easily.  It also doesn't have an articulated LCD (I would like to save getting on my knees for shots from that perspective).  Automatic mode is almost worthless because of the 19-point autofocus being the only option.  I know, you don't buy this kind of camera for automatic mode, but why shouldn't I expect it to work when I pay this much money?  One more con, optical stabilization (OS) makes your lenses cost more than sensor based stabilization.  And if your lens doesn't have OS, you don't have the advantage of OS with that lens.  Ironically, OS can make your pictures more blurry when you use a tripod if you don't turn it off.Pro:  It is a cool looking camera.  It is an iconic Canon capable of using the legendary Canon lenses.  Controls are very easy to get to for the functions you most use after a little practice and you can customize some menus to make them even more user friendly.  I love the \"Q\" button which gives me instant access to about a dozen functions which I often adjust for specific situations.  Focus issues aside, this camera is capable of producing the most beautiful shots I have ever taken, not to mention the extremely high resolution that goes with them.  For outdoors the color is fantastic, but indoors it seems to run a bit on the warm side. In my opinion the build quality is outstanding, though I prefer more of a rubberized grip with a deeper finger grove for a more secure grip on such a heavy camera.  The focus is amazingly fast, and if you use one of the center weighted options it can be pretty accurate, certainly better than my eye with manual focus.  I like the toys available on the camera.  The video is easy to do and very good quality.  The remote flash function works great for setting off a slave.  The remote control feature works well for taking self-portraits.  I like live view mode, especially when taking long exposures at night where you don't want mirror slap and don't want to mess with mirror lock.I am still hoping this camera will be a stepping stone to the next 5D version full sized sensor.  Canon is an icon of cameras, and I would like to stick with them, but the 19-point focus issue has been a big disappointment.  If I were to step back in time I might have gotten the T2i instead and saved my money for the 5D to get sooner, or tried Nikon instead.  Hopefully the focus issue will be worked out, or maybe I just got a lemon, or maybe I still have more to learn about this amazing camera.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 7D with Kit lens 28-135mm", "Author": "P.

VIDEO RECORDING mode is pretty much identical for each; the menu's and button configurations are the only major differences (again, when it comes to VIDEO, I don't use any of them for photography). Everything in the series was shot with the kit 18-135mm IS lens (on all three).From shot to shot there is no difference, but when it comes to durability, the 7d takes the cake with a sturdier build meant to resist both weather and physical damage - to a degree (those who like to recreationally shoot their cameras with bullets should rethink this selection)When it comes to fit, feel, and menus, my OPINION is that the 60d is far superior. Its only slightly smaller than the 7d but has button configurations and menus that are much easier to navigate than the T2i or 7d counterpart.T2i gets size (smaller, if you're into that sort of thing) and price - seeing as its considerably less expensive.Keeping things short: if you're looking into DSLRs specifically for video, I'd say 60d > 7d > T2i; but primarily for personal reasons. All of them record with the same image quality when it comes to video. So burgeoning filmmakers, these three have NO NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES when it comes to image quality (I hope that saves some people some time)I'm certainly not above a little self promotion, though...[...]BAM!If anyone has specific questions about any of the Dslrs mentioned, just ask and I'll tell you what I can.

The AF is broken and many (most?) of the pictures are out of focus.I did the microadjustment for my lens, the 28-70 f/2.8L, and got a value of -17.  After that, the AF was still unpredictable.  I'm using a single, center AF point, and there should be no question that the camera should be able to focus in that mode.Test shots after the MA show dramatic front focusing sometimes, other times not.  I took a picture of a parked car, where I focused on the license plate.  It focused about 10' forward.  Other test shots show random focus, too.  Shutter speeds are high in all tests shots, equal or faster than 1/125s.Is it the lens?  I doubt it.  I have a Canon D30 and the lens works flawlessly on it.  I have 30,000+ pictures from that camera and I've never had trouble with the AF there (thought it is a good deal slower than the 7D).  Ironically, the superior AF is why I upgraded.Is it me?  I doubt it.  I mentioned my D30 already.  I can hear some of you saying \"...but that's a 9+ yr old camera.\"  Well, I borrowed a 5DmkII from a friend and shot about 60 shots outdoors at a picnic.  Every single shot was sharp as a tack.  And, the lens on that camera was significantly cheaper than the L glass I have.UPDATE 1/29/10:Amazon cross-shipped me a new one.  The 2nd one definitely works better, though I need to do more tests to make sure.  (It's been raining a lot here, so I haven't had a chance to really work with it.)UPDATE 7/1/10:Still AF issues.  I've been increasingly frustrated with the 7D and I had started to dread using the camera because of what I'd find when I looked at the resulting photos.  I did two things, borrowed a friend's 5DmkII to use with my usual lens and did a focus test on my 7D.Out of a 100+ shots with the 5D I didn't have any of the problems I've had with my 7D.For the focus test I used the timer and a tripod.  The test subject was 4'8\" away @ 28mm and the aperture was wide open @ f/2.8 in Av mode.  I used spot focus.  I defocused the image and took a series pictures with AF.  Then, I took a series of pictures with MF, using 10x magnification to focus manually.  3 of the 6 AF were very soft and clearly not focused correctly upon examination at 100% magnification.  Under the same magnification, all of the MF pictures were crisp.I really wish I had done the test immediately upon receiving the 2nd 7D (work + bad weather meant I didn't use the camera much).  I would have returned it and gotten a 5DmkII.  Since I'm past the return period from Amazon, I had to sent the camera back to Canon--they received it yesterday, but I haven't heard anything.  I will update again once they've done their thing.UPDATE 7/11/10:Got it back from Canon service.  The email claimed they fixed it, but the insert in the package claims it was already \"performing to specifications\".I performed the lens tests again and found the same problem.I borrowed a friend's 24-105 f/4.0L to see if it's the 7D or the 28-70.  The 24-105 performs fine.What really burns me up: I sent the 28-70 to Canon with the 7D body.  They didn't even look at it, saying that the lens is too old and is \"no longer serviceable.\"  The 28-70 works fine on the D30 I have.  I wish I had access to that 5DmkII again, to do controlled tests to see if it works there.So, I'm left with a $1500 paper weight (what I paid for the 28-70 10 years ago) and have to spend another $1000+ on new L glass.  A very frustrating experience.Btw, I'm upping the rating from 1 to 3 stars.  I still feel that it might be the 7D that can't focus the 28-70, but we'll never know because Canon refused to test the lens.UPDATE 3/11/11:I ended up getting a EF 24-105mm f4L IS USM, which seems to work fine.  The take away from this experience is: if you have older lenses that work fine on your current (older) bodies, do not expect them to work on the 7D.I think that makes this camera worth only 3 stars.", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best DSLR I've ever owned...", "Author": "A.

Unfortunately my excitement about 7D disappeared as soon as I started seriously taking pictures, and especially when I started to view at the images on my PC.Firstly, the auto-focus kept on focusing without a stop whenever I was taking a picture of anything beyond 3 or 4 meters: I just had to turn to manual focusing before I was able to take the picture. Secondly the images taken with auto-focus (within 3-4 meter range) were mostly out of focus: the camera focused on something that it was not supposed to, or on nothing.

Adams \"Fresh Perspective with a Twist\"", "ReviewID": "RZQSPOER89YHD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are intending on buying the 7D because of its video capabilities then be forewarned: The camera overheats far too easily.I purchased the Canon 7D in December 2009, using it to successfully capture some soccer games. During the games the camera was stopped -- not shutdown -- quite frequently whenever there was a pause in the action, which was quite often due to the age of the players. At half-time the camera was turned off. For the first couple of months I experienced no problems. But that is no longer the case. Spring has sprung and with it comes warmer temperatures. This past weekend the camera's overheating icon came on after being on for about fifteen minutes of stopping and starting. Temperature: 60 degrees outside. I stopped the camera. I shut the camera down for a couple of minutes. I turned the camera back on and it worked for a minute or two before flashing the overheating icon again. I put my jacket on top to keep the sun off the camera body. No luck. I was unable to capture the last fifteen minutes of the game.Page 159 of the English EOS 7D manual indicates that the camera will experience overheating issues when used for a prolonged time or under direct sunlight. What it doesn't tell you is how long \"prolonged\" is and under what external temperature conditions this applies too. Based on my results you will have approximately twenty minutes or so when shooting in 60 degrees before the overheating icon flashes. Had I known this I would not have purchased this camera. Given that I'm a long-time Canon customer I can only say that I'm extremely disappointed that the camera overheats so quickly in fair conditions. I'm quite certain Canon is aware of this issue but has chosen to bury it in the operators manual in a loosely-worded description meant to cover their butts. You won't find anything on the Canon 7D product that warns you about \"prolonged\" use. Try searching the 7D's support section. Nothing with the words \"heat, heating, overheat, overheating.\" A search of the internet tells a completely different story.It's a camera trying to be a video camera and under certain conditions it works great. Know your intended shooting conditions before deciding to buy the 7D for its video capabilities. Get real, in the field reviews from people who tell it like it is without wrapping it in sugar-coated wording designed to keep their revenue streams flowing.Despite years of buying Canon products  my next  video camera purchase will be from another manufacturer.March 6, 2010 Update:I have amended my rating from a 1 to a 4. Picture taking: 5, Video Recording: 3. Canon Information on Overheating: 1.This review has always been about the 7D's low overheating threshold and Canon's scant information regarding the matter. I am quite happy with the 7D's picture taking abilities -- when combined with a great lens -- but at this time I only intend on addressing the heating issue.Why is it that on the Canon 7D website, under Power Source Specifications for the battery, that Canon provides an estimated \"number of shots\" table which takes into account the temperature, AE, AF, and Live View Shooting, but doesn't provide something similar for video recording time based on temperature and wind factors? The power source table is there to help people manage their expectations. Something similar should be done for video recording times.Did I expect the camera to be a feature-rich full-time video recorder? Hell no!Am I happy with the video quality? Extremely!Am I please with the sound quality? It's okay. If capturing ambient noise or sound in a closed atmosphere is the goal, then it will get you by. Invest in a good microphone built for your intended use.Did I expect the camera to overheat? Yes, I read about it.Did I expect the overheating problem to occur so quickly when the temperature went from 50 degrees to 60 degrees? No. I thought it would only be a problem when recording for extended periods of time at higher temperatures. Twenty minutes of on and off recording didn't seem like an extended amount of time to me.Knowing what to expect from the camera based on ambient temperature and conditions will better prepare the operator. Based on my experience, once the temperature hits 60 degrees without any breeze, shooting times will drop. As the temperature rises beyond 60 degrees you can expect even less recording time before the temperature warning comes on. You will have to find alternative ways to keep the camera cool. Try an umbrella, a fan, a white cloth draped over the body, or you could even buy a second camera to have on hand when the first one gets too hot. Turn the camera off and get it out of the sun when not in use.Lower your expectations and find creative ways to deal with the problem.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Loved My 7D Until It Stopped Focusing", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "R246QGRGQ0IM6G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Canon 7D was the cats meow for me.

I am now in the UK on vacation visiting family. My EOS7D worked fine until two days ago. It then developed a serious problem : the camera cannot read the CF card, so I cannot take any pictures. I have just got off the phone - here in London - with Canon UK. They have told me that the warranty on my EOS7D is not honored by them - apparently because Canon USA and Canon Europe no longer honor each other's warranties. So, any repairs needed will have to be paid for, even though the camera is only three and a half months old. Alternatively, I can just forget taking pictures with it here on my vacation and get it repaired on return to the USA.This means that : I have been sold a $2000 DSLR camera - which says it has a global Canon warranty. But in fact it does not!I have used Canon cameras and printers for decades. I have always considered them the best. I am now seriously considering selling all my Canon products on Ebay and switching to other brands.If you have to travel outside the USA at all with you camera, my advice is : DO NOT BUY THE EOS7D  or any other Canon camera for that matter.Sadly, Canon has become one of those bureaucratic multinational companies where customer service matters less than making a fast buck at the customer's expense.Happy Holidays Canon! May it be a very very long one!UPDATE - SEPTEMBER 26 2012 :-Since posting the above review, I have sent my EOS7D in to Canon USA, who have repaired my camera under warranty. It is just  shame that I could not get the camera repaired earlier while in the UK, so I could have used it during our family and friends reunion there. So, my feelings about Canon's warranty still stand.As regards the camera repairs, Canon have replaced the CF reader in my camera with a new one. This now works in that I can again take photos.However, the CF card slot still feels very stiff, making it somewhat difficult to insert the CF card. I am therefore still quite concerned that the problem I had before could recur later.I have called Canon to raise this concern. But i was told that the CF card slot was purposely made tighter to avoid the problem of the card missing the pins and bending them when inserted.I have a lot of experience inserting CF cards in Canon digital cameras. I have owned a Powershot G2 since 2002 that has the same CF card system. That is smoother and easier to use and I have never once had a problem with it and have taken tens of thousands of photos.Surprisingly, Canon's tech support did not seem too receptive to being told about my experience, which is at odds with their own thinking on this issue.I am posting this update so others may be aware of this issue, before buying this camera.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its the man behind the camera that matters :)", "Author": "Nomad77", "ReviewID": "R3NS7WEF7BZICF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was thinking of buying a 7D so I did my usually comparison between all the Canon camerasup to the latest models and here is what I found...Unless you are going to make very large prints (above 11x14) then the extra resolution doesn't matter.What I didn't expect though was just how close the 20D still is to these cameras.The only one that really stood out, interestingly enough, was the original 5D.  The 5D is the sharpestcamera Canon has made to date.  (The original 5D looks better than anything Canon has to date.)The bottom line when it comes to pure image quality, the lens make a much bigger difference.Using the same lens the 20D can be made to look almost exactly like the 7D with a little post processing.So what would I gain by buying a 7D...1. A bigger better LCD screen.2. Better auto focus.3. Video.Image quality now is more a function of taking a good photo to begin with and then processing it properlyrather than the camera itself.  Canon has not been able to make any significant improvements from the 20Din this regard so far...IF you are really serious about taking great photographs get a used 20D or 40D and some good lensthen focus on taking photographs instead of all of this technical BS ;)PS This review was based on a friend's 7D and as you will note I did give it 5 stars.  There are two types of photographers I have come to find.  Those that focus on the means and those  that focus on results. I use to be one of the former... Its far easier to buy expensive equipment than  to learn how to really use it.  This camera is more camera than 90% of people will ever need, including myself.

This has been the worst purchase of my entire career.Out of the box my 7D was shooting stills with only 6 stops of latitude on the \"super flat\" setting, even less on \"neutral\" with contrast all the way down. The RAW images look nothing like the LCD and are completely different than represented in the histogram. I have to boost the RAW files 100% in photoshop to get them to look like they look on the LCD/histogram.I shot a comprehensive test side by side with my assistants 7d with the following parameters:Controlled flat/soft lighting.All exact same settings (superflat mode, all image enhancements off ect)17-55mm 2.8 lenseTiffen 20 step greyscale chartMonitor properly calibrated and tweeked ever so slightly for a flatter look.Test result here: Flickr search \"Nomadtv\" (DPP raw files opened on same monitor + mac book)The results are easily apparent to an untrained eye let alone a client, the control camera shoots well over the 10 stops latitude represented on the greyscale chart. I would dare to say its 11 stops or more.My camera could not hold detail in the first 5 to 6 bands and started to loose detail on the upper 2 bands... minimum of 4 to 5 stops less latitude than the control camera.There is obviously a massive difference between the two units.Support (lack there of):Sent to canon with detailed description and a print out of the 2 test images side by side in DPP, camera was gone over 2 weeks and I had to rent (almost $1k lost)Camera came back saying it was within specification and nothing was done to it.Took it out of the box and it is still shooting super contrasty.I again called canon, asked for a manager - Got \"Marvin\"I explained everything that happened and he was unsympathetic.

He never called me back.Called again the next day and found him, he immediately put me on the phone with \"Randy\" who is apparently a \"photographer\". Randy had me send him the RAW files and despite trying to get off the phone with me several times right away, I insisted that he stay with me while he looked at these test shots.He immediately noted that there was a difference between the two. We went through the metadata. The only thing that was different was a slight difference in focal length. Randy proceeded to try to convince me that a slight focal difference could account for the vast difference in image quaility. Are you kidding me on a $1100 Lens, It better not!Randy said he would send this back to \"Marvin\" right away. Marvin never called me back (no suprise).Next day I called marvin again in the afternoon and was told that \"they\" couldn't see much difference between the 2 cameras and that they would not be servicing the camera.

For months, I have vacillated about upgrading to a APS-C 7D and / or Full Frame 5D Mark II. I was looking for three things when I decided to upgrade from the 50D; 1.) ISO speed, 2.) Frames per second, 3.) AF points. Both the 7D and 5D Mark II offered improvements in these areas in addition to increased megapixels. After much research, price comparisons, and recommendations on Amazon's website, I decided on the 7D. After four months of taking pictures with my quality professional Sigma lens I had used with success on my 50D, all I ended up with were out of focus, incorrect forward and / or rearward focus, substantial noise at ISO speeds above 1200, poor sharpness, and soft images. In doing additional online research, I located numerous blogs, threads, and website devoted to 7D issues I was now experiencing from 2009! Most people state Canon refuses to admit a problem and refuses to replace defective 7D's they are unable and / or unwilling to repair! Why would Amazon sell such a camera with this type of \"black cloud\" on their website? Canon knows about and Amazon should have known about these 7D problems!I believed my camera to be defective!! In an attempt to fix the problem, I followed Canon's telephone advice and; 1.) Did a \"hard-restart\" which involved removing the main battery and clock battery, 2.) Removed all lens filters from my lens, 3.) Used a tripod with image stabilization in the off position, 4.) Used 6.3 and above aperture for landscape photos. In the end, little if any improvement was noticed. In doing an, \"apples to apples\" comparison between my XTI Rebel, 50D and 7D, the 50D performed better in focus, sharpness, softness, and focus select and speed of focus!Since I wanted what I payed for and not a $1350 paper weight, I called Amazon on April 14th and was told by a representative that I could return the camera to Amazon for a replacement camera for one year. On April 15th, I telephoned Amazon again and was told a completely different \"story\"! I was told I could not return the camera for a replacement and / or return it and upgrade with Amazon for a 5D mark II and pay the difference. I was told I could return the defective camera for a 50% to 80% refund!! I have spent thousands of dollars on Amazon and they don't want to replace a defective camera?When I asked the Manager why his representative would have offered to replace the camera the day prior, he stated it would be a, \"Training issue\"? Huh! How about, keep your word Amazon!Well, now I have a $1350 paper weight.Update, since writing this review I have been \"working\" with Canon. Canon told me the problem is all the quality professional Sigma lens I have. Canon told me non-Canon lens are not supported by Canon and should not be sold as being compatible. Canon told me to send them three pictures taken with the defective camera using a Canon lens. When I told Canon my quality professional Sigma lens were all that I had, Canon told me to buy, rent, or borrow a Canon lens. Canon \"claimed\" to have sent me a email link where I could send them my pictures. Funny thing is, to date I have not received a email link, over three weeks.Update, tonight, after following a Canon 7D users following \"tips\"; Verify the AF in aperture priority and shutter priority using a single AF point and multiple AF points. It is also important to remember to set the proper Custom Function III. The AF on the 7D is better than what most people who shoot casually need and it has a learning curve.

Also, I have taken some day photos and most, not all, are in focus, correct forward and / or rearward focus, less noise at ISO speeds above 1200, sharper and less soft?I have been taking photos for eight years and never have been more challenged by a camera like the Canon 7D.

I would strongly encourage you to consider paying the extra money to go with the canon 5d mark ii if you do weddings because it works better in low light and gives you full frame. But at this point, there is talk of a next generation Canon 5d mark iii set to be released by the middle of 2011 which if true, would be worth the wait.Great camera for the money but if you are like any if my friends that are aspiring photographers,  you may find yourself outgrowing this camera faster than your wallet would like to see happen.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Videographers BEWARE!", "Author": "W.

First, the UPS person tried to deliver on the promised date (a Friday, the day before the birthday). But we did not hear him knocking, so he left a note on the door without delivering the package.  Second, I called UPS trying to arrange a personal pick-up on a Friday evening. The time they allowed (8:30-9:30 pm) would not work for me. So I asked them to reverse back to Monday delivery, even if it would be two days after the birthday. They would not, saying I had to call Amazon to change the \"routing\".  Third, so I called Amazon CS. A friendly woman put me on a conference call with a UPS representative. He promised that he would change the routing back to home delivery for Monday. They absolutely do not deliver on Saturday. The Amazon person offered to refund the extra charge for the 1-day Prime.  Fourth, on Monday morning a UPS person left a phone message, saying if I do not come to their center (15 miles away) they would wait till Tuesday morning to deliver. Also they would not accept a pre-signed note. I had to wait by the door to make sure I wouldn't miss the knock again.  To avoid further delay I drove 15 miles each way to the UPS center to pick up the package.I understand the security concern of requiring a personal signature for an expensive item (>$1,300), but this process simply defeats the purpose of a rushed order.

So, I assumed that the picture quality should be good. Yes, the picture quality is indeed good, ONLY IF you resize the 25Mbytes of RAW file into something like 1024 pixels width, at ISO 400 and above. You buy a cheap point and shoot camera, and it's image quality will be incredible in low ISO and when there is enough light. We pay more and spend more memory (and pay extra for that) for DSLR to get more descent ISO performance when there isn't enough light. If you willing to resize to 1024 pixel width, there is no problem in high ISO - but then why would you spend 25Mbytes for the RAW ? And why would you pay $1,800 for the body ?I took about 40 pictures in a gathering. It was in the evening and light was more than enough to read books very comfortably. So, at least the light was enough not to create bad quality pictures. However, I used high ISO (1600 and 3200) so that I don't have any blurred pictures. Besides, I read so many praises by 7d fanatics about how good 7D's ISO performance was. Somehow, I trusted them. But  I was very surprised to see so many white dots/pixels in the dark area when viewed in 100%, as I showed in the uploaded picture. Indeed, there is no problem if you down-sample (resize) to 1024 pixel width. You won't be able to see them.I asked around about this problem and there were two types of responses. One is that it is the expected behavior of 7D, which has so many pixels in a small sensor. And I need to remap those white pixels using software. Indeed, LightRoom does it automatically. But not DPP (Raw processing software from Canon). And LightRoom is not ready for 7D as of now. The other response is that 7D is so good in high ISO performance, and I must have gotten a lemon. I hesitated what to do. And I just decided to return it and try an another 7D, only finding that this was a disaster. The new one showed the exactly the same behavior. In addition, the new one has hot pixels that appear even in ISO100. In fact, there are five such dead pixels. I know that this is OK, only if they are spread around. Unfortunately, all those five pixels are adjacent together and the whole white dead spot area is quite visible in every picture.So, I don't know at this moment what to do. I will definitely return this 7D that has the dead pixels. But unfortunately I can only exchange. Would I just exchange to another 7D and live with those white dots in high ISO, and be satisfied with down-sample'ed pictures ? Or would I exchange to other Canon camera or even Nikon... Anyway,  my opinion is that this camera should not be this expensive and waste 25Mbytes for the RAW file just to create this kind of bad images in mid to high ISO. And for my horrible experiences, I can only give one star. But YMMV.--edit---OK, I decided to get the replacement of 7D - this is the 3rd one. This time, I was tired. Whatever it is, I would just take it. I'll live with white dots or some dead pixels or whatever. Let it be my destiny... So, I did not go through mid-to-high ISO testing, and I don't know what it would be this time - and I would not care any more. But then when I took some pictures, I found that they were so soft. I investigated, and saw that 7D is not focusing correctly. The lenses required AF micro-adjustments. At least the previous two 7Ds did not have this AF problem and need not AF microadjustments, as the manual says. They were focusing correctly. Since the 3rd 7D is not, I went through AF micro-adjustments. However, I also found out that  the AF microadjustment at particular distance and aperture is not global within one lens adjustment. For example, if I set the microadjustment correctly at F2.8 from 1 foot  (this was +15), AF at F 5.6 from 7 feet was very fuzzy. So, I set the AF microadjustment from the setting, and the value was - 20, but then the pictures are fuzzy at F2.8 from 1 foot distance. I tried to find the middle value which would work in all cases, but once I found a AF miroadjustment for particular distance and aperture, it wasn't working for other aperture and distance. So, there is no global setting for one lens. It varies depending on the distance and aperture within one lens adjustment. What a bummer... I think that a lot of people who are complaining about 7D's AF problems have 7Ds like the one that I have now.  BUT if you take picture at F8.0 or higher, AF will look OK - not because 7D works correctly, but because at this aperture the depth of field is deeper.So, for all the people who praise Cannon 7D, either you are extremely lucky people, or you just don't care/know about the details.Or I am the extremely unlucky person ...", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not in Kansas Anymore", "Author": "J.
