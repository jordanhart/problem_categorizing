{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't waste your money...", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R1M2XLEO0SPP2Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my first ever dive trip to Cozumel and ended up being very disappointed.Halfway through my first dive, I noticed that the rubber button for the flash was missing; it had came off somewhere in the water and was lost. But that was the least of my problems.Over the course of 7 days and a total of 14 dives to depths ranging from 20 to 119 ft, the camera's performance was subpar to say the least. On three separate occasions, right in the middle of a dive, the camera suddenly displayed a \"card error\" message and quit working. I wish I could comment on battery life but it was all over the charts. One minute it would show a full battery charge (with brand new batteries installed), the next it would show the low battery icon, then turn itself off. I'd turn it back on and it would be back to showing a full battery. The video and picture quality were average at best; they're about on a par with the quality you'd get from a cheap cellphone camera. One of the people in our group was using a Canon Powershot SD1300 IS in a waterproof case and the photos and video from that camera made the Mini II's look like crap! And the problem wasn't with the person taking the pictures. Another person in our group was also using a brand new Mini II and he shares my opinion. Both of us plan on returning our cameras for a refund.UPDATE: I was indeed able to return the Mini II for a refund and instead bought a Canon Powershot 300HS camera and Canon's underwater housing for it. Price-wise, the Canon and the housing cost me the same as the Mini II. Took the 300HS on a 7 day dive trip to Roatan and the quality of the photos and high definition video (unavailable on the Mini II) was outstanding, proving conclusively (in my case anyway) that the Sealife Mini II is a piece of junk.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$234.91", "Features": null, "Name": "Water and Land Adventure Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416Df7lOjVL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004RTNYWG"}}
