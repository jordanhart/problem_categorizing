I bought this lightweight small camera to keep in my purse-for those unexpected shots you want to take. I have a Sony Cypershot with a 12X optical that I normally use. The Sony is great for action shots and taking marching band shots from the bleachers. This one, I'm not sure could do that. It has a 3x optical, which is fine for zooming in on a person across the room, but not as far as into the football field. The in-camera zoom is ok for trimming, but I noticed it does lose some of the clarity on the shot.The one drawback to this camera is the lag time between shots. If you like capturing shot after shot quickly-avoid this camera. However, if you are someone who generally takes shots of people at birthday parties, or objects on your vacation, this might be a great camera for you. It is a decent camera for the price. For what I wanted it for, it is perfect.Ok, to sum up:PROSSmall, lightweightGood picture qualityCan take an SD card up to 4GB (That's A LOT!)Easy to useInexpensive-goes on sale sometimes for around $100Can take rechargeable batteries (I recommend for ALL digital cameras)Video capabilitiesSoftware compatable with older Windows(in case you need that)CONSLag time between shotsIn Camera Zoom loses picture qualityAs you can see, I like most of the features.

I use this camera along with a much more expensive Canon camera I have and they are rougly equal. But these cheaper cameras have a longer lagtime.Otherwise if anything the Samsung is better because it takes equally good pictures with excellent color accuracy inside and out, and needs less tweaking on auto.Some reveiwers reveal their ignorance because they use alkaline batteries in the first place and yet complain of short battery life. Alkaline batteries last about a third as long as rechargeable Nimh ones, and the latter can be charged 500-1000 times. Alkaline batteries make no sense.Moreover, there is a setting for Nimh batteries and Alkaline. If you use Nimh, youll get astonishly long battery life, but not if the factory setting of \"alkaline\" isn't changed.I might also add that Nimh batteries can be normally in the 1800-2700 range, and the higher they are the longer the battery life.I don't change the batteries on this camera very often at all, but I use some of the energy saver settings and 2700 NIMH batteries of the type that don't lose hardly any of their charge (sold cheaply on Amazon). Otherwise regular NIMH batteries lose 40% of their charge EVERY MONTH just sitting around.I bought my battery charger including 4 2500 NIMH batteries for $13 from Amazon with no shipping charges or tax. Get the batteries that hardly lose their charge too.There are many setting that extend the battery life as well, such as \"lcd save\", \"normal\" vs. \"fine\" and \"ultra-fine\", lcd \"bright, normal and dark\", and also how long you want the image to show after taking it (1-5 seconds), and how much time yould like to elapse before the camera shuts off (3-10 minutes).All digital cameras have difficult menus and poor manuals, so it's no wonder users struggle often with the wrong settings. Some of the settings cannot be made on \"Auto\" and must be made on \"P\" (program).Now the 7 and 8mp version are out and they are even cheaper. The settings and quality on the 7mp are the same; the settings on the 8mphave been rearranged a bit, but it is smaller with the same size monitor.So get either of those instead.", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Just Okay.", "Author": "Douglas E.

The picture quality just isn't there, all the pictures feel a little flat.  Not blurry, per se, just never crisp.  That being the primary function of a camera, I can't get too up on this thing.  I have a 5 year old Nikon Coolpix 2100 that I paid the same price for back then (87 bucks on sale) that takes better photos than this.  Cheap optics on this camera, I suppose.The battery life seems to be fairly limited as well and the response time seems a tad slow.  If an inanimate object could have malaise, this camera would.Everything works, and nothing's bad enough to make me feel ripped off, but by no means is this little thing impressive, certainly not as great as what some of the other reviewers have made it out to be.

It was a different make, and it lasted all of four months before heading to the great recycling center in the sky. When I discovered the camera we had bought only had a 3 month warranty, I felt badly and decided to get her a replacement that might actually last for a decent period of time.After researching various cameras, I discovered this particular camera. It was the right price, had similar features to the one we had previously given her and it had a 1 year warranty. Also, the warranty is good worldwide, allowing her to get warranty service in Germany if it becomes necessary. That is not a common feature in other makes.After several weeks of use, she is thrilled with the way it works. It takes wonderful pictures for a point and shoot, and is constructed of far better materials than similar priced cameras. I will admit that it does take a little while to record a picture, and it does inhale batteries, but these are problems that we saw in her previous camera, and I think are a function of the price.Overall, for the price and type of camera, we are extremely happy and would buy another Samsung camera in a flash.

The battery life, unlike some other statements, is great for me. I can go all day, usually around 600 shots and not have to swap out batteries. I use 2500mA batteries from Wal-Mart and have used the same set for two years now, every single day! I did manage to drop the camera pretty hard on a parking lot and the battery door flew open and batteries flew out across the lot, but when I put them back in, the camera worked fine and this was a month ago. It did damage the nice red finish, but that's not too important to me. The 2.5\" LCD is a little hard to see in direct sunlight, but not nearly as bad as my old Canon Powershot camera.

The employee at the store told recommended it to me and he told hes used the same batteries for four years now. But anyways, you have to spend a little bit of time learning how to work the camera.

But to anyone thinking of buying this Camera dont walk , RUN to purchase it! This is without a doubt the finest little camera on the market for $89! It will take pictures as good as a $3-400 one [if it is set correctly] And to address the battery issue??? There isnt one........... all the comment about the batterys that came with it only lasting 10 mins that is TRUE .......... however that is the same length of time; they would last, in ANY digital camera. The LCD display takes alot of power to run on ANY camera. The problem is most of the folks on here howling about this camera need to be smarter than the camera and they are NOT. Why so many have said that it doesnt have a battery meter is a mystery to me; as it is shown in the upper right corner and tells you the state of charge at all times. For the camera to take the crispest photos you need to set it to Sharpness=Vivid Plus and Contrast to HIGH. The manual isnt much good to anyone; and you have to wade thru the online one, to find out how it really works: and that is the worst part of the camera the online manual...........Once this is set up correctly, you couldnt ask for a nicer little camera, for $89 there just isnt one made. 99% of the problem is that people dont understand cameras and they WONT read the manual ......... hence the battery problems, uses to much power, no meter, poor quality pictures, etc.The camera will take supurb quality photos if you set it up correctly but you do need to know enough about it to make those settings .", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "much better than you'd think", "Author": "P.

But then I played around with the settings a bit--guess what?  Turning off the 'beeps' and fake shutter sound, as well as turning down the brightness of the LCD completely get rid of the high battery consumption problem.I had a bad experience with the last digital camera I had (Casio--what a piece of nice-looking junk!) so I vowed not to spend a lot on my next camera (guess what, there is no correlation between how much you spend and how long a camera lasts--cheap or expensive consider yourself lucky to get two years from your camera--I have a sneaking suspicion this is built-in obsolescence, eg. Canon's infamous 'E18' error).Well, this Samsung S630 (at a third of the price of the Casio or the Canon) is great so far; I primarily use it to take macro shots of graphics to use in my courses and the sharpness of the close-ups is excellent.  The camera does good work in auto mode, or if you prefer to tinker with multiple settings, you can do that as well.I also like the fact that this camera uses the AA batteries you can buy anywhere, not some proprietary battery type that only the manufacturer sells for beaucoups bucks.Finally, I'm not a shill for Samsung.  I just don't like getting ripped off, and I think that's what the bigger names in the camera business are doing.

First I was disconnected three different times.  Then after 20 minutes on the phone it was suggested that I go out and buy rechargeable batteries and call back if those don't work.  When I refused to replace the brand new lithium batteries with rechargeable batteries I was told I would have to go online and ask for a request to return the merchandise for repair... what?!?

If you have a 15 minute video you're wanting to record, you better cut that sucker down to 5 minutes because that's about how long it will take before your batteries are dead.My advice is - don't waste your money on this camera!

My Can0n shoots the same size picture, and at 3MB, but at 180dpi! The visual difference is huge. The 2 AA batteries make the unit a little bigger than some would like, but I like that they are easily replaceable without having to go brand-specific. Low-light situations are just \"acceptable.\" Not great. More digital noise in low light images than I think there should be at this point in the digital camera game.Other Thoughts:The USB cable that comes with it is ABSOLUTELY necessary. Why? Samsung decided to go with the ultra small USB link on the camera, meaning you cannot use the other (larger) somewhat standard USB cable. Meaning: more cables to mind. Fairly easy to use if you have used other programmable digi' cams. All the settings are what I expected and nothing wowed me or really bothered me. Good point-and-shoot for kids, non-professional photographers and people looking for decent quality images. Kingston 1 GB SD Card SD/1GBKR works well with it.

I would avoid this product like the plague if I could try again; I absolutely hate it.First major problem is battery life. It's awful. I was trying to take pictures in a cave I was exploring on vacation, and we went through 3 sets of batteries (that's 6 AA batteries) in just 30 minutes. One pair of brand new Energizer batteries, right out of the packaging, was actually dead in 7 minutes. This is inexcusable, and to add insult to injury you can't plug the camera in and recharge rechargeable batteries, so you either spend more on batteries than you do on the camera every time you go on vacation, or you lug around a battery charger with you everywhere you go.The battery life might be a little better if you turned off the digital view screen, but guess what? There is no optical view! You have no way of knowing what you're going to take a picture of with the digital view screen off.The pictures all come out looking like total crap, you may very well get a 6 megapixel image, but that's only the number of pixels in the image, it says nothing about the quality. Pictures are grainy, blurry, and noisy. You almost never get a picture looking the way it did in the viewscreen after you snap the shot. The autofocus is so bad, turning it on is like applying the Blur filter in photoshop to your picture, and the manual focus isn't much better either, particularly with such an inaccurate viewscreen. Pictures invariably come out with an intense yellow or orange tint when they looked fine in the viewscreen, and changing no settings, taking the same shot 5-6 times you'll finally come out with a picture that has the colors you see with your eyes.Because of the deplorable battery life, the camera will turn itself off after 3-4 minutes of inactivity, which would be a good feature, if it didn't take 30 seconds to boot up. The result: if you need to quickly turn the camera on and take a picture of something before you drive past it, or it stops happening, or any other situation where speed is a necessity, you completely miss the shot; but if you just keep the camera on in anticipation of taking the shot, the batteries will die almost instantly.Using it to record video sucks down power even faster than the already obscene rate the camera consumes batteries. Even worse, every time you zoom in or out the camera completely cuts off all audio recording. Immagine taking a tour of something really interesting, your tour guide is explaining some history or other details to you, you zoom in on what he's talking about to get a better look, and when you go to look at the video after your vacation, there is just silence as you were zooming in and out. Would you be angry? I sure am!My girlfriend has a 2.3 megapixel camera in her cell phone. Every single picture she took with it came out better than every picture I took with this camera, including inside a dark cave, where my flash should have drastically outperformed hers. At the end of the day, her cell phone still had power, where my camera had gone through 6 AA batteries in 30 minutes.Do not buy this cheap piece of junk, unless you see it on eBay of course, which is where I'll be trying to get rid of it. ;-)", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Okay for the price", "Author": "M.

The first thing you feel is the cheap plastic.  We're not talking the same plastic most digital cameras are made of; this is CHEAP!  Without batteries, it is by far the lightest digital camera I have ever held.  That is already a turn off in my opinion.  I doesn't look or feel, in any way, durable.  I'm afraid of squeezing it too hard in the anticipation it will crack.  Not good.It has the same amount of buttons and switches most point and shoot cameras possess, the power button, the shutter button, a menu button, etc.  The one thing it does have that most don't is the turntable switch to choose different modes of shots, which is usually only found on SLRs.  I don't know if Samsung thought this would be appealing to people.  It certainly makes switching shots quicker, but it's not going to cancel out the horrible body.The startup time of the camera is quite fast with no welcome screen, so that's good.  The first thing that I want to do is get in there and setup the size of the image.  But, wait!  It's nowhere to be found.  2816x2112 seems to be the only resolution this camera takes.  But, I later discover that you have to press the trash can button to change image sizes.  It's not in the menu where you would find it in most cameras.So, after I have the images fine tuned, I go to take a shot.  I have a stuffed moose that sits on my desk and I use it as a prop for most of my photo taking lately.  It seems no matter what setting I set it on, Portrait, Scene, Manual, ASR, Program, Auto, or Night Scene, this camera will NOT focus on the moose, no matter how far away from it I am (we're talking within 5 feet or so).  Now, most of the other cameras I've tested will focus within 2 feet of the moose.  This is rediculous.I take a picture of a different subject that the camera WILL focus on and wait for the Eye-Fi to upload it.  IMMEDIATELY I notice noise in every shot.  I thought this was just the jenky LCD screen that they used with the camera.  Nope, it's the image itself.  There is no reason why this camera should have so much noise.I'm done toying with this camera by now.  There is nothing that is going to bring my rating above one star.
