Operation wise, the menu system of the Nikon was much more intuitive and easier than the Canon. One thing I hated about the Canon is you have to install software drivers just to have the camera be recognized. However with the Nikon first thing I did was put in the batteries, CF card, took some shots, and plugged into my computer via the USB cable and I was able to see it as a removable drive, and then drag and drop my pictures onto the desktop. It is truly plug and play and you don't need to install any software for it to work.  The battery life is also very very good with a 1600mA NIMH rechargebale, I already took 200 shots with LCD and have yet to recharge them. Anothing area where this camera excels is its lens, the Nikkor lens I found to be much much sharper than the Canon lens, which are known to have softness as one of its characteristics.  The zoom lens adds a lot of versatility to the camera. One favorite thing I like was that there is only one connector for both the TV out and the USB upload, as they use the same interface on the camera. This is more efficient than having a separate hole for USB and another hole for TV out. Also this camera seems more efficient in utilizing Compact Flash space. For example, I can get 155 shots on a 64MB compact flash on Normal mode, when an average 1600*1200 picture is only around 400k, which is less than about 500k for other cameras. I've noticed this exists in other Nikon models as well from online reviews that I have read. All in all, to sum it up, this camera is relatively small, have sharp lens that display excellent detail and accurate colors, and is very easy to use. One more thing I like to point out is that even due to a lack of AF assist lamp, the camera does well in low light situations. Perhaps it doesn't need an AF assist lamp, which is why it was left out in the first place. It takes pictures in the night without flash as if it had night vision technology integrated, I was surprised how well night shots turned out for a relatively inexpensive camera. One thing I would improve for this camera would be user selectable ISO in manual mode, this would lessen a little bit of noise in low lighting situations, but however being a 2MP camera, the noise are not noticeable to the naked eye. I would recommend this camera to anyone on a budget, but demands sharp and true colored pictures.", "Date": "April 10, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "LJC", "ReviewID": "R7PP2AYWX6EHI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an old hand me down Kodak digital camera, and I mean old...the high res on it is like 150 pixels.  It is fine for on-line pics, but I have been waiting til digitals came down in price to purchase one I thought would last me a long time.After reading a lot, I decided on this camera.  My only reservation was whether or not to spend the extra money for a 3.2 megapixel.  It seemed for the money, this was a better choice than a low end 3.2 camera.I have been very pleased with it.  The menus are very intuitive, the delete is quick and easy to discard a shot.There are enough settings on this to satisfy an amateur photographer.  I am a gardener, and the macro did a great closeup on my roses.Print wise, you will see no discernable difference on this camera on pics up to a 5X7 than off a traditional camera.  I didn't find an 8 X 10 to be of a quality that I would want, but, then again, I didn't expect it to be.  How often do you print 8 X 10's anyway?  If that is what you need, you probably need to move to a 3.2 camera, but for snapshops and 5 X7's you will be thrilled with this one.Some reviews (and the Nikon manual) say you should only use Lexar and Scandisk memory.

Kao", "ReviewID": "R2NA7KQZ5UHHTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, I admit it - I was first drawn to this camera because of how small and cute it is, and how it fits ergonomically in my right hand. At first I was considering the 3100 until ultimately, I decided 2MP was all I really needed. I'm only looking at pictures on my computer, emailing/posting them on the web, and printing 4 x 6. The $100 price difference was also a factor - It's not that I can't afford to spend more, it was more like...is it worth spending so much money on a point-and-shoot digital camera? Especially when you have to factor in an extra $150 or so for accessories. Plus, digicams are changing so rapidly, I'll probably want another one in a couple of years. (However, if you want more flexible printing options, you'll probably want a 3MP or higher).  Now that the price dropped, it makes the camera even more worth the price! I also considered other brands, but decided on the Nikon because (1) I've had other types of Nikons in the past that have captured memorable photos and are still clicking; (2) the Nikon digicams use the more common (and cheaper) CF memory cards; and (3) have the option of using two AA batteries.  I picked up some Duracell 2050 mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries that came with a 30 min charger, and they work great. I was worried initially, because of all the negative reviews about battery power I've read about online. And it did seem to drain the batteries more on first use (maybe because it was charging the internal clock battery?). But now it works great. The features on the camera are also a plus - it's so easy to use. It took me just a couple minutes to figure out all the functions. Though you don't get shutter or aperture priority (just buy an SLR if you want that!) the modes more than compensate. I especially liked the macro feature and the white balance. And there doesn't seem to be a problem focusing in low light despite the lack of an AF assist lamp.  The only downsides I can think of (which are really minor) - maybe a little too small for a man's hands; not all the scene modes are really that useful; some parts of the body are a bit too plasticky (but who knows if this will be a problem in the future or not).  In short, great pictures, great features (that both the beginner and the amateur can appreciate), really easy to use, easy to transfer to my computer, and affordable!", "Date": "October 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "Just to answer a couple neg reviews...", "Author": "Ryan Ellis", "ReviewID": "R2O2Y137ZSH9WN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LCD screen QUICKLY turns off using the \"LCD SCREEN OFF\" button right under the screen... this same button will also disable/enable the helpful on-screen information (how many pictures you have, what size, etc.).The battery is NOT hard to install, not sure what you are talking about, I had it in and running immediately.If you would learn how to use the camera, a light press of the shutter button focuses the camera on the object, you can hold it here all day, then, when you decide to take the picture, a full press of the button takes the picture INSTANTLY.It's a shame people give negative reviews about such a great product.If you are looking for a wonderful camera at a budget, this IS the camera you need, does EXCELLENT video and picture quality.TONS of features, nighttime pictures, etc.. but also a simple setting for normal use... you can even EASILY edit pictures right on the camera.I got the case and rechargeable battery set which works great, never need to worry about batteries.I did a print of 8x10 with the 2 megapixels and the picture looked just fine, unless you are directly comparing the SAME picture side by side with a higher megapixel camera, you won't notice ANY difference, it looks awesome, this will do 4x6 and 5x7 prints nice and clearly.The camera is small and is a blast, I LOVE it and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera who isn't looking for \"super awesome professional sharp clear pictures\".This will do prints wonderfully.", "Date": "October 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "great size and functionality, beware of memory card", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2IWUO0JLS3N11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i was reading the reviews below and noticed someone else had a problem with the memory card as well.  just wanted to share my similar experience, though i DID use one that was recommended (SanDisk), however, found that it STILL took a long time to save each picture, so the wait time between taking pictures was just too long for me.  this was very strange to me as i tried the same memory card in other cameras and it did not have this issue.  i've sinced bought the same brand memory card as the starter card (Lexar) and have had no problems.  so now i love the camera.  it is the perfect size, great functionality with lots of options, and for a great price.

It doesn't have all the features of some cameras in this price range, mind you, but it does what it does quite well.I've been taking photos, I suppose you could say \"semi-professionally,\" for more than 20 years.  I still prefer my mid-end 35mm Nikon SLR, but I had a need for a moderately fast digital camera to use for posting to web sites and to email friends.  Generally speaking, you don't need too many megapixels for this kind of use.  And for this purpose, the 2100 is just about perfect.  It takes very good close ups (perfect for auctions) and the exposures are generally pretty good.What it does not do well: Very limited manual controls (is that even needed in this price/megapixel range?), not too good at red eye reduction, and its movie mode is a total waste given that there's no sound.I looked at several other cameras in this price range and I decided on the Nikon because of how it felt, how it functioned, and the quality behind the product.  The Canon A60 is functionally a far better camera with a great movie mode with sound.  However, having tested it personally, I found it to be far more complicated than it needed to be.  It also just didn't feel right in my hands.  You put these two cameras hand in hand and you'll see the difference.  The Nikon is just made to be held.  I don't know what the Canon folks were thinking: It feels like a block with a raised hand grip.  Also, the Canon just didn't feel well made.  The limited research I did with the sales clerk and a search on the Internet indicated that Canon has some quality issues with the A60.If you can spend more money on a camera and/or you're looking for something you can use for enlargements then you'll want to look elsewhere.  Nikon, Olympus, Sony and others have better cameras for less than one hundred dollars more.

The store where I bought the camera sold me a 128 M memory card, claiming that they are all very universal.  Wrong.  The instructions (inside the box) for memory cards clearly indicate the tested and recommended brands.  The card I was sold is not on the list, and because of this, I get intermittant results.  Sometimes the camera works with the card, sometimes I get an error message that says \"You can Not Use This Card\".  When the camera is in this mode, it will not work at all.

I'm the techie in the family, so I have to teach a TOTAL non-techie to take and then transfer pictures to his laptop so he can burn them to CDs. Included with this camera is a video on CD that explains how to use the camera and its various modes and settings.  That was extremely helpful to my husband and he was taking pictures immediately after watching the video.  VERY HELPFUL!The next step was installing the software so we could transfer his pictures to the computer.  Using Windows XP the software installation went smoothly, but when we plugged the camera into the USB port it was listed as an \"unknown USB device\" and was not recognized properly.  Some quick research on the internet identified this as a problem with motherboards using the VIA chipset (as ours does) and suggested a Microsoft patch to fix the problem.  After downloading and installing the patch and restarting the computer, the camera was correctly identified and works perfectly now.  If you need the patch, go to Microsoft'ssite at [...] and enter \"KB822603\" in the search box.  It's only 342KB and you'll need to restart after installing.We are totally pleased with the picture quality and color!  The pictures he's taken using auto mode have been crisp and clear, and now we're experimenting with some of the scene selection modes.  I took a macro closeup of our African Grey parrot from 5 inches and it's crystal clear, with every feather perfectly defined.  We took some zoom pictures of deer in the snow in our backyard at approximately 75 yards right before dark using the dusk/dawn mode, and all that was needed was to lighten the shot a bit using the included software. Our regular 35mm camera can't even do that. Both outdoor and indoor shots are consistently good and the flash works nicely.  Red eye is easily fixed using the software, which also allows changing the brightness and contrast, adjusting the color RGB balance, and resizing the picture. There is also an \"autofix\" option that works well.  My husband learned the software in about an hour (which is a major miracle!) and can now take photos, transfer them to the computer and tweak them to his heart's content, all without further assistance from me! :)  I've set the resolution to \"PC\" so the pictures display at 1024x768, and with a 64MB flash card I get 278 pictures.  The included 16MB card gets 69 at that resolution.  Since we don't need prints larger than 4x6 that resolution works for us -- we prefer the shots to be full-screen on our computer monitor and burn them to CDs to use for slideshows on TV using our DVD player. There are higher resolutions available if desired, like 1600x1200 high resolution for larger photo prints.  Also, there are a variety of compression options available when saving pictures, which is helpful when emailing from a dialup connection so you're not sending huge files that take forever to download.  The included CRV3 battery is still going strong after several hundred shots with the LCD monitor on continuously.  I bought rechargeable batteries but haven't needed to use them yet.  My old 1MP digital camera with no zoom and no preview screen was much harder on batteries, and if I didn't remove the battery when the camera was turned off if was dead the next day.  The battery door on the Nikon 2100 feels flimsy, so I'd recommend pressing the battery into place and holding down with your finger until you can slide the battery door closed.  I wouldn't pressure the batteries into place using the door.I like not having a separate lens cap to fool with, as the built-in lens cover automatically opens when the camera is powered on and closes when it's powered off. The camera is light and fits comfortably in your hand.  The LCD screen is bright and easy to see, especially when scrolling through menus.  We didn't have any problem seeing the screen outdoors in full sun, even with the sun's reflection on icy snow from a recent storm.  The camera goes into standby mode and the LCD screen turns off automatically after 30 seconds of non-use and then takes about 4 seconds to wake up, but that's the default setting which can be changed to longer intervals if desired.  Holding the shutter button down halfway focuses the shot and when the button is pressed fully down, there is a quiet but definite  click so you know the picture has been taken.  It takes only a couple of seconds for the camera to refocus so you can shoot again. Good price, ease of use, excellent pictures, and Nikon quality -- what more could I ask for?  I recommend this camera without reservation and am completely happy with it in every way!  In fact, I like it so much I ordered one for my brother last night!Might not be the best choice for a professional photographer, but for everyday use at a reasonable price, it's awesome!!!", "Date": "February 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great general use camera", "Author": "\"frumpy16\"", "ReviewID": "R2X7ZY07K5NK4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have watched the digital market for a couple of years waiting to buy a camera.  After Christmas was finally the time for me.  After researching extensively, I selected the Coolpix 2100 for its price and features.  I came to the conclusion that at this price point, you can either get a 2 MP camera with some features (i.e. scene modes, optical zoom, Nikon lens, etc) or get about a very basic 3 MP camera or one with a no name brand.  I have played around with the camera for awhile and I like the results.  Pictures are sharp.  The auto mode does a very good job of making the puctures turn out well.  If you want a camera that you can just take pictures with without having to fool with much, this camera is for you.  If you like a little more control, there is a manual mode which offers limited options.I would suggest buying a 128 MB CompactFlash card (it holds about 130 high res pics and about 250 next-to-highest res) as well as some good NiMH batteries (the higher mAh the better.)Overall, this is a great camera which is easy to use and takes good pictures.

Sony does have a lot of features (and SOUND with the movie), but there are 3 important factors: the cost of the memory card, the size, and weight.PROS for Nikon 2100:===================1) Supports compact flash memory cards.-This makes a HUGE difference as it will save you a lot of money.  2) Small compact camera.-Unlike the Sony DSCP52 that makes your hand feel tired after holding it for too long with one hand.3) Weight.-Very light4) Doesn't use a proprietary battery like other small cameras.-Mine came with the nikon coolpix rechargeable Ni-Mh70 batteries (these ones are really good ).5) So many modes to choose from depending on your situation.-I don't know which other camera in this class comes with this many modes (like ones for fireworks, sunset/sunrise, beaches, etc.)6) Image transfer.-This was pretty quick and easy. Installing the software doesn't take too long either.CONS:====1) The manual is just way too confusing.  It's kind of hard to follow, and I'm eager to discover all the wonderful things and features that I can use with the camera.  I guess it takes a lot of time. 2) No sound with the movie.  3) Gets scratched easily + not very solid built (I'm always scared of damaging the battery door).4) When turning LCD mon on, it takes a few secs (though this is tolerable).Overall:=======Note: I'm a beginner at taking digital pictures; this will be my first digital camera!  But as a beginner, I find this camera to satisfy more than enough for my basic demands.  I have yet to try out the sunrise mode, but so far the ones I've taken in my room look really good.

They were both priced the same and basically had the same specs. It boiled down to \"ease of operation\". To delete a shot with the Nikon 2100, you touch one button. On the Olympus model, you have to navigate through the menu and it's quite aggravating. That's just one of the many features that Nikon has added to the 2100. The menu is quite user friendly and the camera is very easy to use. A part of me was worried getting a 2.0 megapixel camera, but there really isn't that much of a difference between a 3.0/2.0 on a 4X6 picture. One other note, and this may seem elementary: the camera looks great! Very sleek and compact. There are some downsides: the flash seems a bit hot and the shutter is quite slow - you can't snap the shutter like you can on an SLR, causing you to miss some of those moments that happen in the \"blink of an eye\".

C. Wrigley \"Atomic\"", "ReviewID": "R3SEV9K66DKPO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I'll tell you what I use this camera for, and then let you decide if this review is even relevant for you.  I am a freshmen in college.  I carry the camera with me wherever I go, and just take pictures of anything I find interesting.  I am not a professional photographer or anything of the sort.  I use it for fun and so I can remember things down the line.  That said, here is what I find are the positives of this camera:1.  It's small.  I can fit it in my pockets easily.  Also, the switch is designed so that it doesn't easily go on or take pictures in my pocket.2.  It's easy to use.  The automatic mode takes great pictures most of the time, and it's easy enough to turn the flash on/off or change the exposure if I need to.3.  It has optical zoom.  Don't be led in my digital zoom, it's pointless.  Digital zoom just enlarges pixels.  Optical zoom will actually zoom in on the subject and give you the high res zoom in you want.  Optical zoom is a must.4.  It has video.  True, no sound, but it is a nice feature to have.5.  LCD screen/menu system.  It's always nice to be able to review pictures.  Don't try and save money on a camera without a screen.  You can use it to see what your pictures are like, if they are blurry or not (you can zoom in on your previews to check out the sharpness of them), etc.  Also, screens provide a better idea of the picture you are taking than the optical viewfinder.6.  The upper wheel makes it very easy to change modes on the camera.7.  The USB cable makes transferring pictures fast and easy.8.  It runs on double-A's.  I use rechargeable NiMh batteries.  They last a good week or so before I need to recharge them.  I take at least 10 pictures a day on them with flash and screen on, if not more (it's a digital camera so you will probably end up taking 4 pictures for every 1 you keep).9.  You can take rapid pictures easily, hold the shutter button slightly to focus, press down to take, repeat.Now, here are the negatives, most of which are only minor:1.  The only flaw I would say I really care about is the exposure time for night shots.  I can't really say it's any better with other cameras, but if the object is out of range of the flash or you can't use the flash for some reason, it will come out a little grainy or blurry.  2.  The resolution is 2 megapixels.  More than enough for most computer desktops, but if you want to cut out and enlarge portions of it, you're going to be limited because once you start cropping there isn't much left to crop.  Think about spending a little more on the 3100, same menu system and case but more resolution.3.  It takes a couple seconds to turn on.  I've missed a few pictures because of this, but it's nothing much.4.  Sports/action shots sometimes come out blurry, but this is expected with entry level digitals.5.  Somehow from being in my pocket all the time without a case it got dust inside the viewfinder.  If you use the viewfinder a lot and plan to keep it in your pocket, I recommend a case.  I don't use the viewfinder however, so it doesn't really matter to me.That's about it.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase.

You", "ReviewID": "R2YSKJ2QGO891G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using a Nikon Coolpix 950 (2MP) camera for several years and decided to buy the 2100 as a gift for my wife around 12/2003 from Amazon. I had been satisfied with the quality of photographs for the 950 and am now also satisfied with the 2100. For about 1/6th of the price and less than 1/2 of the size, the quality of the 2100 is nearly identical. As an all-around point-and-shoot for a very good price, the 2100 is a winner. However, my suggestion is to use only disposable or rechargeable Lithium-based batteries and not NiMH.I hesitated writing a review until I could figure out a problem with rechargeable batteries. The disposable CR-V3 lithium battery is excellent and can easily last a few months and a few hundred pictures. Flash recharge time is acceptable (although when you have infants or toddlers who don't sit still it might not be!). But when I used high-capacity (2000 mAh) 1.2V rechargeable NiMH (nickel-metal hydride) batteries, the flash recharge time was poor and it would take many seconds to be able to take the next picture. A low-battery indicator would be displayed too soon even if the batteries had enough of a charge, suggesting that the lower voltage (2.4 V for NiMH versus 3.0 V for the disposable) made it difficult for the camera to sense the true strength of the charge that was left. Even worse, the short shelf life of even fully charged NiMH batteries rendered them almost empty, at least as the 2100 saw them, after two or three weeks of no use so we would have to keep swapping in fully charged batteries. The 2100 did get a firmware upgrade that mentions addressing problems with NiMH batteries, but our camera was shipped with the latest. So after numerous attempts at using various brands of rechargeable NiMH batteries, which is the kind that is popular for digital cameras, I was discouraged.Then I found the \"RCR-V3\" battery on the web, a replacement for the CR-V3 disposable. Thomas Distributing sells a couple brands that will cost upwards to $40 including the charger and shipping. But now I can say it was worth it. With the RCR-V3, the low-battery indicator does not show up prematurely, the flash recharge time is as short as the disposable CR-V3, and the shelf life of the rechargeable is excellent for more than a month. We have the NEXcell brand, but I think any of the brands would work well. Now I highly recommend this camera, as long as it is using lithium based batteries.", "Date": "September 10, 2004"}, {"Title": "bang for your buck", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2I0ZPO31MA76S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera.

James \"Vanity\"", "ReviewID": "R1HYTQ8UI150N1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my beloved Sony Mavica that finally gave out. The \"bang for buck\" with this digital is unparallel, and of course everyone knows Nikon makes a great camera! At the time I was on a tighter budget so this camera fit my needs but it is more of a \"beginner\" \"point and shoot\" type of camera. It has several modes all of which are again geared toward the novice photographer, going into the menu inside each mode allows for some minute tweaking. My one major gripe is the complete lack of focus when working with fur. I hobby breed chinchillas and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a decent shot of one of them with this camera. I have many other pets I try and photograph but it is extremely difficult. I much prefer my old mavica in this respect as I could get crystal clear pictures of ALL my animals without any hassling with the camera. That is not to say that I haven't gotten some great pictures of my furry companions with a bit of patience!However, there is alot of positives! This camera does take excellent macro shots, it also takes great scenery and people shots, and it works brilliantly at night as the flash sensor is excellent and the flash itself is very powerful and bright. The functionality is excellent, and with the help of reading the owners manual you can unlock many of this cameras better features.This camera uses a new battery called the \"CRV3\", many leading battery manufacturers now make this compact but powerful battery. I use my Nikon frequently, pretty much everyday several times a day, and I get GREAT battery life. I am not throwing batteries in every few days like some of my friends have to do with their \"AA\" powered cameras. I did buy a Energizer replacement battery rather than a Panasonic (which is supplied) and I have been very happy with them.  To address some of the other reviews:The battery cover DOES feel a bit flimsy, but after you get comfortable handling the camera you learn how much pressure to use. I like to push the battery into the socket fully and then slide the cover over, this helps with not putting so much pressure on the cover. The LCD monitor has a dedicated button right below the LCD screen sandwiched between the delete and menu buttons. One touch and it instantly turns the LCD screen off.

Operation wise, the menu system of the Nikon was much more intuitive and easier than the Canon. One thing I hated about the Canon is you have to install software drivers just to have the camera be recognized. However with the Nikon first thing I did was put in the batteries, CF card, took some shots, and plugged into my computer via the USB cable and I was able to see it as a removable drive, and then drag and drop my pictures onto the desktop. It is truly plug and play and you don't need to install any software for it to work.  The battery life is also very very good with a 1600mA NIMH rechargebale, I already took 200 shots with LCD and have yet to recharge them. Anothing area where this camera excels is its lens, the Nikkor lens I found to be much much sharper than the Canon lens, which are known to have softness as one of its characteristics.  The zoom lens adds a lot of versatility to the camera. One favorite thing I like was that there is only one connector for both the TV out and the USB upload, as they use the same interface on the camera. This is more efficient than having a separate hole for USB and another hole for TV out. Also this camera seems more efficient in utilizing Compact Flash space. For example, I can get 155 shots on a 64MB compact flash on Normal mode, when an average 1600*1200 picture is only around 400k, which is less than about 500k for other cameras. I've noticed this exists in other Nikon models as well from online reviews that I have read. All in all, to sum it up, this camera is relatively small, have sharp lens that display excellent detail and accurate colors, and is very easy to use. One more thing I like to point out is that even due to a lack of AF assist lamp, the camera does well in low light situations. Perhaps it doesn't need an AF assist lamp, which is why it was left out in the first place. It takes pictures in the night without flash as if it had night vision technology integrated, I was surprised how well night shots turned out for a relatively inexpensive camera. One thing I would improve for this camera would be user selectable ISO in manual mode, this would lessen a little bit of noise in low lighting situations, but however being a 2MP camera, the noise are not noticeable to the naked eye.

I did an inordinate amount of research before buying (a latent Asperger's kicks in whenever I shop for technogizmos) and spoke to a number of serious photogeeks. There was a consensus: A good lens is of paramount importance.That advice continues, I believe, to hold true, even several technological generations later: all cameras, digital or not, capture the image using a lens. No matter how nifty the digital guts of the camera, the lens is what hands the image to the CCD.Pro:Nikon makes really good lenses. And this camera takes very, very good pictures. 2.1 MP is plenty big enough for any digital photo displayed on a webpage. The images are sharp, clean, nice color saturation, and all of the digital \"mode\" doodads give you lots of versatility and entertainment until you become bored with 99% of them and recognize them as a waste of time (just like 2007 technology cameras.) It's very easy to use, and the thumb controls are basically identical to 2007 technology. It's very lightweight. I never dropped mine once, not even from a few inches, so I can't attest to any mil-spec durability, but in years of use, it always worked just fine, cold weather or hot. It's small but thick: you can put it in a shirt pocket, but you probably won't.Con:OK, so it's only 2.1 MP. And it's a slow as cold molasses: push the shutter button and at least a full second elapses before the picture is captured. The screen then goes black, and you wait for another second or so before the camera recovers for another shot. If you happened to shoot in conditions that trigger the flash, then you get to wait for a good eight seconds before you can shoot again. Battery life is a joke, and batteries go dead sitting in the camera even when it's turned off.  The LCD screen in the back is tiny.Why you might want one:If you can get one for really cheap, go for it. It's very easy to use, small and light enough to take everywhere, takes very good pictures with a resolution adequate for web use, and even a kid can figure out how to use it.Me, I just gave mine away.

I wanted movie WITH sound as I've not had sound ever with my old one. I went down in Megapixels with this camera, but it was a good price like everyone is saying. I'm still learning it, there are a LOT of options, which I still need to get down. My only complaint which I feel is huge, is the candid shots. I was trying to take a pic of my neighbor's cat for her, and everytime he would move his head, that's when it would snap the picture. So the delay is actually longer than my older camera. But other than that, its good so far. The display on the LCD does go off after a short amount of time. Kind of annoying. The battery I had no problem with, I think lids of batteries are probably all flimsy, but this one is just like all the rest. I ended up buying Energizer 2 double A's to replace the battery that came with it because the Target guy said the manufactuer's battery wouldn't last as long as 2 double A's.

It has so many great features for the price, the zoom is adequate for taking some great pictures.  I like the fact that you can delete pictures quickly if needed, no having to go through some menu to get the picture deleted.  The screen is large enough to read everything well, and the movie feature is really cool.  You can view your pictures on the TV if you like, and the time it takes to download to your computer is minimal.  The camera also doesn't drain your batteries very quickly.  Overall, a great little compact camera to start out with!  I would highly recommend it for any beginner just looking for some great photos!", "Date": "August 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great budget digital", "Author": "J. James \"Vanity\"", "ReviewID": "R1324JU12S1MF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my beloved Sony Mavica that finally gave out. The \"bang for buck\" with this digital is unparallel, and of course everyone knows Nikon makes a great camera! At the time I was on a tighter budget so this camera fit my needs but it is more of a \"beginner\" \"point and shoot\" type of camera. It has several modes all of which are again geared toward the novice photographer, going into the menu inside each mode allows for some minute tweaking. My one major gripe is the complete lack of focus when working with fur. I hobby breed chinchillas and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a decent shot of one of them with this camera. I have many other pets I try and photograph but it is extremely difficult. I much prefer my old mavica in this respect as I could get crystal clear pictures of ALL my animals without any hassling with the camera. That is not to say that I haven't gotten some great pictures of my furry companions with a bit of patience!However, there is alot of positives! This camera does take excellent macro shots, it also takes great scenery and people shots, and it works brilliantly at night as the flash sensor is excellent and the flash itself is very powerful and bright. The functionality is excellent, and with the help of reading the owners manual you can unlock many of this cameras better features.This camera uses a new battery called the \"CRV3\", many leading battery manufacturers now make this compact but powerful battery. I use my Nikon frequently, pretty much everyday several times a day, and I get GREAT battery life. I am not throwing batteries in every few days like some of my friends have to do with their \"AA\" powered cameras. I did buy a Energizer replacement battery rather than a Panasonic (which is supplied) and I have been very happy with them.  To address some of the other reviews:The battery cover DOES feel a bit flimsy, but after you get comfortable handling the camera you learn how much pressure to use. I like to push the battery into the socket fully and then slide the cover over, this helps with not putting so much pressure on the cover. The LCD monitor has a dedicated button right below the LCD screen sandwiched between the delete and menu buttons. One touch and it instantly turns the LCD screen off. Bottom line - If you are a beginner to the hobby or just want an affordable digital to take pictures of friends and family this is an EXCELLENT, AFFORDABLE choice!", "Date": "June 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Buy Great Features Great Camera", "Author": "brent", "ReviewID": "R2F75QBVHHLQYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is one of the best out there i think that it is worth 250 dollars and think that everything about it is great.This camera has evreything from a built in video camera to 9 different scene modes and an LCD screen.One other GREAT featuree i found in this camera is that it does not delete your pictures even if the batteries all of a sudden go dead or even once you've transfered the pictures to the computer they are still in the camera.", "Date": "May 30, 2003"}, {"Title": "A great camera for anyone new to digital photography", "Author": "Hayley Knighten", "ReviewID": "R1Z3GB8245I3ZV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was my first digital camera and I have to say that when I first got it I loved it.

It takes nice outdoor pictures, but it is so slow that you have to warn your subjects to hold still and wait for it to flash.  I frequently get blurry pictures indoors or in low light.  Forget candid photos because by the time the camera goes off, the moment has been missed.  Also, the camera goes to sleep after a few seconds and then it takes about another 30 seconds to come back on. By the time you get the family posed, the camera has shut off, and by the time the camera comes back on Aunt Ida has already disappeared.Also, AA batteries (even the high-power-camera ones) do not work well in the Coolpix.", "Date": "November 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "Problems with Refurbished Unit", "Author": "E.

While the unit has 3X optical zoom and is conveniently small, there are several significant shortcomings that made me return the camera:- In Auto mode, there is a 2-4 second delay from the time you depress the shutter release until the camera focuses and takes the picture. I found this unacceptable. I confirmed with Nikon technical support that this cannot be changed when in auto mode. (My Fuji 2600 has almost no delay and it is 2M, 3X, and auto-focus also.)- The LCD monitor comes on by default whenever you turn the camera on. I prefer to use the viewfinder and only rarely use the LCD panel to take shots. There may be a way to change this but I could not easily find out how.- The manual is confusing. There are three modes for selecting and changing options - Set-up, Menu, and direct buttons for some features. The manual doesn't clarify which mode to use for various options. Confusing.- The CRV3 battery that comes with the unit is almost impossible to install. You have to force it into the camera and force the battery cover closed. The battery cover is quite flimsy and feels like it might break.
