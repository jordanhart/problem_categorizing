Mcglynn", "ReviewID": "RPS5AUMASGQZJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am giving this 2 stars instead of one because it does come with a lot of accessories.  Part from the that this camera should be sold in the children's toy section.  I can't imagine spending $8 on this let alone $80.  It came in the mail and I was incredibly disappointed on the quality of camera.  It felt and look quite frankly like a piece of junk.  The Fuji that I was replacing with this camera was waaayyy better at only 5 megapixel.  Don't be swayed this went back 2 days later.  I bought the Samsung DualView instead.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "terrible", "Author": "girl 11", "ReviewID": "RBYUV2WI1YPC1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "something must be wrong with this camera  cant see subject when taking the picture totally darkand pic comes out all blurry  have not been able to take a good picture  should try to get money back", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Mid grade", "Author": "Felicia J.
