I'm 15, and i take LOTS of pictures with my friends, and if your looking for a great digital camera, tiny in size, great- crystal clear images.... get this camera! I have also heard from other people that have it that They've dropped it a few times and it holds up great, its all metal-- so its pretty sturdy! Oh, and it also has a pretty big viewing screen! its great... like 2 and a half inch screen!!! && It has a long lasting battery! So it won't die when you need to take a picture! --amazing!
