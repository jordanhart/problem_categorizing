{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Almost Great, But Not Quite. 4.5 Stars. Bought Another One After 10 Months!", "Author": "Ethan A. Winning \"ewin64\"", "ReviewID": "RSMZO8OP9TZRG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sept. 1, 2012 - Although I'm always leery that Canon will come out with a new model soon after I order a camera, I have just placed an order for an SX40HS for my wife! Some of you may think that it must be worth 5 stars now, and the answer is that it is not perfect. Low light even using a higher ISO is still an issue, but the lens and IS at 35x are superb. Many of the photos that I have posted with this review have recently won photo contests, and that is certainly due to the equipment almost as much as my knowing how to use it.****Nov. 3, 2011 - [Please see posted photos from my first days' shootings. A picture is worth a thousand words.] I will do a complete review as the weather clears and I can take some photos in various light conditions. So far, it has performed well enough, but there is a learning curve from the SX20 which allowed greater latitude in overriding what the camera \"wants to do.\"It may take a month before I can review the camera adequately, so I have uploaded some photos that I took on the first day, and I must say that they're pretty good. However, there were only 8 out of 51 taken. ...And then it started to rain. Please note that I am not new to the Canon line or (nature) photography: I have had the A620, S3, S5, SX10, SX20, and now the SX40. (I returned the SX30 which was a terrible disappointment.) And I've been taking pictures for over 60 years. So, unless you really get to know the camera - and even then - you may or may not get the results that I do.On that note, I might add that I was sorely disappointed that Canon didn't pop for a printed manual which, with this camera, is a must. Unlike the SX20 for which I could use the SX10 manual, this camera is quite different and - so far - I think more complex or at least more different than the SX20. Because of the issues that I've run into just in 3 days, it's very difficult to cross-reference what it says under Av with Tv or C1. This is not the basic point-and-shoot Elph, and I rarely shoot in \"Auto.\" As I said, I have to give it a couple of weeks before I'll pass judgment.I must say that the photos that WERE already posted when I bought the camera gave me some trepidation in that so many were a little washed out. What I am finding so far is that, \"Auto\" might well be \"Average.\" Average aperture, Average speed, Average contrast. But I purchased it anyway, and I've already found that Av or Tv or M are still the best settings although, unlike the SX20 where one could just set the speed and the camera would use the setting, I had to save the Tv settings to C1 or C2. This became routine by my third day (today).Nov. 8, 2011: Five days since I got the camera, and three days of shooting. I must say I've never seen so many comments regarding reviews, and many people have agreed with the more negative comments. What I've found is that the quality of photos I've taken have been excellent, needing very little post-production diddling. That said, and having used the burst mode, I'm deleting 4/5ths of the pix that I've taken, some because of duplication, some because of focus, and some because I just screwed up.In looking at the negative comments, I would admonish people to decide before buying this camera - or any other camera - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO USE THE CAMERA FOR??? I take pictures of nature, some scenery, but mostly birds, bugs, bunnies, bees, bears, and begonias. The SX40 HS has done very well in these areas, and I realize that there is a learning curve for such extreme focal lengths and the macro (which I rarely use).If you're going to take night time shots - which seems to have garnered so much comment about viewfinders and such - I can't address it. I took a picture of the (harvest) moon, hand-held, in Tv mode and it came out beautifully. But I don't take many nighttime pix, and I haven't had a chance to take fireworks in years. (If I want snapshots of people or parties, I use my wife's Elph.)I am still having some difficulty in overriding what the camera is set for re: aperture and speed. The SX20 could be overridden just by setting the speed to 1/2500th and one would get a much darker picture which could then be adjusted with software. Sometimes, it's the only way to get realistic clouds. With the SX40, I set it for 1/2500 and when I shoot, the camera comes down to 1/1600 or slower. IF I ever get the printed manual that Canon promised, I'll look for the menu where I can increase the value of the photo by -3 to +3. Yeah, I'm being a little lazy, but I hate the .pdf manual on disc that came with the camera.On the plus side, by coming down to 12 mp from 14 and by improving the processor, I can finally get SOME pix in low light or at least on a cloudy day. I've posted a few photos from the past few days: the two of the golden-crowned sparrows and the hummer were taken in low light and in thickets. They came out as sharp as anything I've ever taken with the SX10 or 20 (or S3 or S5 etc. etc.). Another plus, I am not having as much trouble with the SX40 focusing on a bird in the middle of a tree. The camera spots the center and at least HALF the time immediately seems to understand I want the bird not the branches.IF every photo I took came out perfectly, where's the fun in photography? Yes, sometimes the SX40 frustrates me, but Mother Nature sometimes frustrates me. Sometimes I think Mother Nature is picking on me. I ALWAYS though that Canon picked on everybody. After all, why do they come out with an improvement (?) every 10-12 months? Okay, the SX30 was terrible...I'll continue this in another week or so. For the time being, what I really like is the sharp photos I've been getting, and the 8 fps in the burst mode (the third is usually the best). I'm still not crazy about is the lack of an override for Tv and Av even using the C1, and I THINK the viewfinder is smaller than the SX20.Oh, btw, this camera is a few crucial (after a 5 hour hike) ounces less than the SX20. It's probably because it has a proprietary battery instead of the 4 AAs. I like the weight. What I don't like is that Canon wants $59 for a second battery, and has warned me about buying from \"the secondary market.\" Comments? Suggestions? I'd appreciate knowing if there's a reliable battery that will work with this camera. (One of the other dealers offering a second battery as part of the SX40 HS package has been called out for offering a battery that doesn't fit the SX40!)I think it's silly to say that the LCD isn't as clear as a computer monitor. Never had one that was, and I'm often disappointed when something that looks in focus on the LCD is not nearly as sharp on my computer. After 12 years of digital photography, I've become accustomed to it. At least I didn't waste any film and have to wait two weeks to find out that my vacation pix are lousy.Still 4 stars for the features, 5 for the photos I've taken, and 3.5 for Canon engineers.Nov. 14, 2011. I posted more photos which speak for themselves. However, there is a caveat: I took 191 photos this morning mostly of deer, wild turkey, hawks, one praying mantis, and one tarantula. Of the 191, I posted (on my own site) 9. Here, I posted 5. And I kept 11. 180 were deleted, and that brings up two points. The burst mode of 8 fps works. That is, the SX40 really can shoot at 8 frames per second. However, not all will be in focus; many will be identical shots; and it is not the panacea for carefully composing and focusing and being at the right setting. (If you need the burst mode, you may be best off in Tv because speed is what you're after.)And please note: The battery is rated at being able to take 400 photos at the highest resolution and using the viewfinder (380 using the LCD). Well, if you shoot in the burst mode often or you take \"movies,\" expect your battery to go in about 250 shots - and that's fast at 8 fps. I have just purchased two more batteries and, though they're not Canon \"approved\" because they're 1/4th the price, I'm hoping that I now will never run out of batteries while shooting. Will report on that when I get them.Just one note re: the battery indicator. When the battery indicator is down from 3 (full) to 2 bars, it only takes 3-5 more photos to get it to show red and Charge the Battery. This isn't a lot more helpful than the old SX20 which allowed about 10 shots when it said to change the battery without any precursor. I was really looking forward to having a real battery indicator. This ain't it. Still 4.5 stars.Nov. 22, 2011I started this review on Nov. 3 by saying, \"So far so good,\" but I had a few reservations. I no longer have reservations, and would definitely recommend the SX40 to anyone who is more than a novice photographer. This is not a \"simple\" point and shoot, and you may get more than what you need or even want.It takes great photos, but you still have to know how to tweak its capabilities. If you're just going to keep this at \"Auto,\" then you don't need this camera. However, if you really want wants such as taking movies and using \"my colors\" and a quasi-fisheye mode, this may very well be the camera for you. If you want to take pictures in RAW, this is not the camera for you. I care about none of these things, so for me the camera gets 4.5 stars. If you want those features, this camera may be only a 3 or 4.So basically, I'm content with my purchase. There's no second-guessing. No alternative would have made me happier. I REALLY like it, but I don't love it. BUT look at it this way: if I got perfect pictures every time, it would take all the fun out of digital photography. I still need room for creativity ... and improvement.Important NOTE: I did not buy this package from Beach Camera though I did buy the camera through Amazon. The price of the package from Beach would be about the same as if one were to buy the camera at $379 plus the 16GB Transcend card plus the extra batters through Amazon, so all and all, Beach is giving a very fair and comparable deal.I have added newer photos so that you can see how sharp this lens is...", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, I bought another.", "Author": "RB", "ReviewID": "R24JO92HSIC20", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was going to go with a Rebel T3i but I am no pro nor do I want to play with lenses etc. Then I saw this camera just came out and decided to give it a try.I used it for a weekend and was really impressed with it. I know it isn't a DSLR, but I am not into photography that much, I just like to take pictures. I always was frustrated with the small pocket cameras not zooming in enough for the pictures I take, NO problem here! The zoom is awesome and the pictures turn out awesome.

I compose my shots with the zoom, the SX 40 has a 35x optical zoom and it works very well. It is possible to shoot video and use the zoom, the camera slows the zoom action when on long zoom so you don't get the disorientation that too fast a zoom can give. It is great for the grandkids soccer games, I can follow the action anywhere on the field. The image stabilization works very well, even on maximum zoom, and even when shooting video. The camera also allows the user to set a lot of the settings manually, though the programmed settings will handle 95% of the shots well. The macro function works well, even with indoor lighting. Another nifty feature is the articulated screen, it seemed like a gimmick until I used it, and I really like it. You can take shots holding the camera overhead, or down low without getting on the ground, and the grandkids like being able to see themselves when they take a self portrait. The camera is not intended for a professional photographer, but for the rest of us it is great.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Full Body SLR on the Market.", "Author": "wvhunter1968", "ReviewID": "RZEXXAO2ER899", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife recently asked me about getting a camera for around the house and wanted to upgrade from our old point and shoot. Being an amateur photo enthusiast for as long as I have been and hanging with some real camera nuts I can honestly say I never hesitated. The Canon SX40 HS is the answer for many who want to get more serious, but maybe the bulk or price of a true dSLR doesn't fit your needs. In many (and most cases) this camera not only fills the gap, it will leave you not even wanting a true dSLR. This coming from a man that owns a Nikon D7000 with 3 detachable lenses and hundreds of dollars in accessories. I also own a Canon SX20is which is 2 years old as of this writing.No, the Canon is not a detachable lens camera, that's because it is in a class all it's own. This camera is top in it's class amongst bridge style camera's in picture quality and shooting side by side with the Nikon Cool PIx direct competition proved what I had thought all along. (Again this coming from a Nikon d7000 owner). Canon plain and simple owns the high end bridge camera market in my opinion.Zoom is a big seller and many are disappointed when they hit the dSLR market and see the price of even a modest Zoom lens. Many wonder what 200mm even means as far as \"power equivalent\" as far as a direct comparison to rifle scopes, say. That is about a 4 power rifle scope. Superzooms like this break the price barrier and for those that find zoom a big seller, this camera is a big draw. Quality usually goes down when zoom is involved. Ask any camera buff. I ask them to test this baby out. That's all I ask. They will be amazed. If you asked their unbiased opinion of pictures taken with this camera before you tell them what they came from they will be even more amazed.  The detractors, I'm sure, will mutter some mumbo jumbo about how the f-stop was at a horrible setting and that there is no way they can get as much quality as their $5000 outfit. It may be so on a certain level when comparing many technical aspects, but what I like is flat out results, not what some technical guru is telling you. And I LOVE the results of the testing I've put this camera through.It has a 35X optical zoom (WITH an incredible 140X digital zoom) that produces images better than I could ever have imagined (even compared to my 80x zoom on my sx20...so big improvements in technology there!). It has an optical stabilization of which I am totally impressed with considering you can freehand a zoomed in pic at 140 digital zoom (35x optical) and get impressive pics. The zoom doesn't seem to suffer from lack of resolution or light gathering capabilities either in daylight hours.. On one particular extremely overcast day my wife took a picture of a clock tower off in the distance with it filling the frame completely (and then some) with no motion and beautiful resolution. Considering at full zoom the 35mm equivilant is 840mm (can you imagine the price of THAT lens for a dSLR) I found this impressive. You could see the paint peeling off the clock face she got so close! We were a good 300 yards from it.Size is manageable as well. Smaller than any dSLR. It's not slim like a pocket camera, but it isn't bulky like a dSLR either. Its a \"best of both worlds hybrid camera\" that any camera enthusiast would be proud to have in their arsenal. In addition the video on this camera rivals any consumer HD camera available. I use my sx20 for my youtube videos and consistently get complimented on image quality. This camera 'upped the ante' even more (from my sx20) and bumped up quality to a full 1080HD video WITH autofocus (which even the best dSLR cameras cannot rival to this date). Considering video cameras have typically low res picture taking quality, it almost makes sense to buy this as your video camera and you get awesome 12MP picture quality in addition.OK, so thus far you may think I have elevated this to God status. I realize it's faults. I know it's shortcomings. Thus the reason I own my Nikon d7000.A true dSLR has advantages. Manually focusing pictures is so much easier, lower f-stops (with the correct lens, which btw are very expensive), wide angle shots (again, expensive lense) and the ability to crank out 3200ISO pictures with decent quality are the 3 that come to mind immediatly. The art of pulling together a beautiful picture that you can truly call your own, with a combination of technical expertise and composing can be more fully realized with a dSLR detachable lens type camera. But for the average person looking at your pictures and seeing the end result, most all but the most arogant camera snobs would say \"who cares\" [lol]. Again, this coming from a man that owns an amazing Nikon dSLR.For the amateur enthusiast who wants to 'up their game' (without the expense of a magnum camera), dabble with manual settings and experiment with various picture options like fish eye lens, color swapping/enhancing and having the capability to get high quality video all within one carry around camera (without the bag) and so much more...I will HIGHLY recommend this camera to anybody that is looking for a camera but not quite wanting to reach into the expensive dSLR market.Recommended add ons would be a Lens conversion ring to 58mm that will enable you to attach filters onto. This conversion ring is available in several stores here on Amazon.  In it's current state there is no way to attach a conventional filter. Remember to get a 58mm lens cap along with 58mm circular polarizer, ND (9stop min) and a UV/protecting filter (ALL MULTI COATED) to realize the full potential of your rig.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving This Camera!!", "Author": "K.

I decided to capture the full moon. The first shot is of the moon when the camera is zoomed to the 140x digital, then I zoom out. Look at the clarity. I'm also going to post some pics of the moon I took when zoomed in.  I really debated between this and a Canon T2i, but I haven't owned a DSLR and was a bit intimidated. However, having had \"higher end\" point and shoot cameras in the past, I wanted to take a step up with this camera. The sales guy at Best Buy tried to steer me from this, saying it was a hybrid and I should go for a DSLR, so I went to another store and bought it there...and I am loving this camera so far! I am playing around with some of the settings you would get on a DSLR and learning more, but even point and shoot is giving me stunnning pictures. The zoom is what I really wanted--I want a camera that can get me in nice and close from a far distance, and this has amazing stability when you zoom in, even hand held (I typically love Kodak, but the Z990 with the 30x zoom gets shaky when zoomed in to its max so I returned it and got this). Check out the pictures of the moon zoomed in--you'll be amazed!", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very good superzoom camera for amateurs", "Author": "JohnG", "ReviewID": "R33NR8DZZTP246", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this kit to supplement by Canon G12, also a good advanced camera for experienced amateurs. The superzoom with sophisticated image stabilization and decent build sold me. The SX 40 has numerous creative filters and many scene modes. For those who like to set aperture, shutter speed, white balance or focus manually, this camera will let you do that. You can shoot extremely auto, extremely manual or anything in between. Overall, reviews are pretty good, though you can't please them all. The recent G series cameras do offer more sophisticated exposure options and more manual control dials, as well as smaller size and weight, but this is a very nice addition for a non-SLR.A few words about the Amazon kit. The 4GB card is adequate for still images, but you might want a faster, bigger card for video. The DigPro case I used for a smaller, cheaper camera as I needed a larger bag to hold my accessories: USB cable, CPL filter, filter adapter, extra card and battery, battery charger, cleaning kit. The USA Gear Venture DX (also available through Amazon) fit the bill perfectly. I stongly encourage buyers to get a Canon filter adapter and 67mm polarizing filterto bring our those colors and cut through haze.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well Worth The $379 Price!!! and then some!!", "Author": "W.

Love the gadget bag that came with the camera.everything is a perfect fit. I will edit this review again when I give it a full testing, but so far it's my dream camera.
