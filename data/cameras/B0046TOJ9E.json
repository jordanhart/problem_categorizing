{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "SkiDad1985", "ReviewID": "R31SQWXOMS5TGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially saw this device at a local retailer and was impressed by its small size and available features.  I ordered it through Amazon and initially had some setup issues due to the default video protocol being PAL and not NTSC.  However, an email and call to tech support solved this matter.  I also utilized Channel Vision's DDNS service.  Overall I can't say enough about their tech support.  Due to my fat fingers I changed some settings that required a complete reset.  The tech help was patient, helpful and got the DVR back up and running in no time.  Well done!", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$388.00", "Features": "Please Note: The DVR-43G-NO HD- Hard Drive not included", "Name": "Channel Vision Dvr-43g 3g 4 Channel Dvr Bndl", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vXUu%2BYeVL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0046TOJ9E"}}
