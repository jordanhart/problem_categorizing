{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Remote software needs work", "Author": "Pat", "ReviewID": "R19KQJX8TTZWBT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The recorder works well all features pretty much as advertised. Motion detection recording is great. The event log or date time range box to find past events took a little getting used to vs. just a vcr screen type scroll back thru old recording date and times. But it makes sense after some use.  During playback its odd if you are in 4 camera screen or one camer view and the camere that had recorded activity reaches the end of its recording fo rthat period the view goes back to all 8 cameras, so you have to reselect one or 4 camer view when playback for the desired camera resumes would rather have a blank screen and the time counter continue running or skip to the next recording event for the selected camera.The remote web viewing is really quirky, IE7 blows up at some point almost everytime I am viewing remotely.  On my laptop the remote screen does not always size correctly so the controls on the bottom are cutoff no scroll to get to them, and the \"power\" button is cutoff so task manager is the only way to end a session.  On my local network desktop the screen size is ok and it blows up less often. Configuration should have an option to not require a password to close the remote viewing session, its just annowing to enter a password to quit remote viewing every time.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,800.00", "Features": "Connect up to 8 cameras with multiple viewing options\nPentaplex system allows simultanious local playback, remote network playback, recording, editing, and real time monitoring\nFree DDNS service for remote Internet access\nExpandable up to 1 Terrabyte, and upgradeable to DVDRW\nUSB interface for image transfer", "Name": "Lorex 8 Channel Pentaplex Network DVR with CD-RW and 300GB HDD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Y800NX6NL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000HZIC4Y"}}
