Wells", "ReviewID": "ROPTLU8EOI2NS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the camera world, we are probably considered dinosaurs as we have been very skeptical about the possibly of upgrading to a Digital Canon SLR from a Canon film SLR. But we finally did and purchased a XTI 10.1MP.First our concerns about the upgrade:Our prior experience with digital cameras has not been very positive.  We purchased 2 years ago a 5 MP Nikon Coolpix and it was terrible.  The software was terrible and the shutter speed was just plain awful.  We never used it and almost always reverted back to our Canon 35MM SLR.A friend of ours visited two weeks ago and she had a Nikon Digital SLR camera and took tons of pictures of our children like a pro.  I was amazed at the quality of her pictures and was even more amazed when two weeks later, she sent me a published quality picture book of pictures that she took of our children. For people that are just getting into to digital photography, there are web sites that will publish a full color 20 page book (can put multiple pictures on one sheet) for $40 including shipping.The day I got her book was the day, I decided that I was going to get a digital SLR camera too.Since her Nikon was so great, we debated about whether we should give Nikon another try or stick with Canon.  Since we personally have had good luck with Canon and had compatible lens we decided to go with the Canon.We LOVE OUR CANON XTI.  It is extremely easy to use and takes awesome quality pictures.  The software works great and though I've only had the camera for less than a week, I've already published one book.I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice deal.", "Author": "J.
