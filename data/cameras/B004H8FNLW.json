{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice point and shoot", "Author": "Mike K \"technoguy\"", "ReviewID": "R3N9F7J9SANHP3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lately when traveling I bring along a bigger camera for myself and a point and shoot for the kids.  This summer our family trip was to the National Parks of Utah.  For the point and shoot I brought along a little Canon that I had just bought a month earlier and used  twice prior in test shoots.  Unfortunately as soon as we got to Utah it was dead (don't know why).  That meant a trip to Walmart and in about 10 minutes I was leaving with this little camera in hand.  Therefore, I didn't do any pre-purchase research and so I was hoping that I didn't make a mistake.  Luckily, I didn't.The camera is small and thin and attractive (in a camera sort of way).  Controls are very simple to use but there are a lot of point and shoot advanced features like a really cool panorama feature that stitches all of your photos together right in the camera.  We didn't shoot a lot of video with this camera but a little test video that I did looked pretty good for an inexpensive camera.The camera doesn't have a lot of manual controls, but most people who would buy this camera wouldn't use them anyway.  Like many new cameras it has an intelligent auto function that can actually adjust the camera for different types of scenes automatically.  Freeze movement, landscape, macro, and so on.  It also has a \"intelligent plus\" option for difficult situations like capturing in low light.Battery life seems pretty good and it is so light you won't even know it is in your pocket.  In addition, it comes with a outboard charger so you can easily have an extra battery on hand if you wish.  My kids actually filled up a 4 GB SD card so I feel that I have a pretty good handle on the picture quality which is very nice.  The other camera that I took was a hybrid micro 4 3 camera which (of course) took better pictures, but with some minor tweaking in a photo editor the Sony pictures looked almost as good.Downside?  The camera packs a lot of pixels in a very tiny sensor so low light photos without a flash won't be as good as they could be.  In addition (I think) this camera automatically adjusts the size of the image depending on the photo situation so you may not be getting the full 14 megapixels with each of your photos (at least that is what I have read about other Sony point and shoots).Build quality is OK but the battery compartment is a bit on the flimsy side.  On a positive note, this camera will use SD cards or memory sticks.  SD cards are easy to find when on vacation and have been the standard with these types of cameras.Would I buy it again... absolutely.  Low price and good pictures!", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "camNY82 \"imaginecarrie\"", "ReviewID": "RZ89JBEUTLMH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this camera in red. Cosmetically, it is very nice looking and compact. I wanted a new camera and am fed up with Kodak - my most recent EasyShare lasted me 2 years before freezing and turning subjects into Casper the friendly ghost, so I decided Kodak quality isn't what it used to be. Whenever I think quality electronics, I immediately think Sony, so why not for cameras? I am not disappointed in my choice. The biggest reason I love this camera is that it takes quick shots. My 16 month old son does NOT like to pose or sit still, so if I want to capture the cute things he does, I need a quick response between pushing the shutter and actually catching the image on the camera. This camera impresses me on that front. I am not a techie, but as a simple needs kinda photographer, I say this is a winner!", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good and Affordable point and shoot.", "Author": "S.

It has pretty decent stabilization, and produces fairly good quality shots in low lighting with a high ISO, for a point and shoot. It also has an interesting soft skin feature that is great for close up portraits, skin looks softer but not fake or overly digital. I took it to disneyland and although the shutter speed is a little too slow for action shots is pretty awesome in every other sense. I would definetly recommend it for the price. The HD video recording feature is awesome, its the first time I have been able to zoom in with a sony point and shoot while I was already recording, that itself was worth the price.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but the battery must be removed too charge.", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "R1KDDJ11FSTIFR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased 4 of these a couple weeks ago for work. We use them for recording and documenting NDE exams at a nuclear power plant. I like a camera that can get up and real personal with things like damaged bolting, pitting in materials, and Magnaflux exam indications. This camera will do a fine job, it works well for general indoor use and can take great detail with the lens about 4-5 inches from the subject.The camera drops easily into your pants pocket, or into your cargo pants. It is not heavy or bulky at all. In low light, it fires an inferred light to get focused and it works very well.Where they completely dropped the ball is with the charging system. You can not plug a USB cable into it and charge the device. Your forced to remove the battery and place it into a proprietary dock to charge. This is painful when you are using the camera daily, especially when compounded by the fact that the camera drops all date, time and setting memory each time you remove the battery. Ridiculous.It's a shame on the battery, it should have been charged internally and been able to be plugged into a standard micro USB cable on your pc, just like your cell phone is. This reminds of Sony proprietary memory and iPhone/iPod proprietary charging cables. Things that make you want to smack someone.Don't let the battery alone sway you away, because other than that, this would have been a 5 star review. It takes really great pictures, especially at its price point.

But in the bigger picture compared to modern digital cameras, it's average in picture quality but above average in value. It does HD video, has one touch no fuss photo modes, lots of neat features, and a compact profile. The LCD screen on the back is bright and easy to see. It can get amazingly close for macro pictures. Just an inch or two it seems. It can take seamless panorama pictures, automatically detect faces, smiles, and even blinking at the wrong time. It also has a lithium ion rechargeable battery.For the money, it does a lot. The picture quality is average, neither great or bad, full HD video -- though the video is limited to 2GB chunks no matter how big your memory card is, and limited to appx 29 minutes in length. The battery will do several hundred pictures or about 70 minutes of video before quitting.BUT....It has two extremely annoying attributes that really really irritate me. First, you have to remove the battery to charge the camera. It can't be charged internally, and it can't be charged via USB. And second, when you remove the battery to charge it, you have to reset the date, time, time zone, and a few other settings EVERY SINGLE TIME. Not all of them though. Even though the date is important to me, it retains all the quality settings, the sounds, and the miscellaneous settings.I'm in shock that this is even an issue when our ancient digital camera managed this amazing date retention feature despite being 8 years old. The level of irritation by this will shock you. You read this review and think, \"I can't believe this guy is so petty he'd whine about that.\" Look, get the camera and then tell me with a straight face that you really like resetting the date and like having to carry around a separate charger because it can't charge via USB.--Update after 6 months of use. Camera no longer loses date and time with battery removed. Apparently it has a self-healing feature. Bizarre. However, it depletes the battery even when off. I kept yelling at my wife about leaving the battery depleted after use, but I notice that it was draining even after we had it in storage. This is extremely annoying. It will deplete a fully charged battery in a matter of weeks. Because the batteries take many hours to charge, the camera is out of commission for a long time. We have begun removing the battery from the camera when stored.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "Arthur J.

Percentage-wise the old4 Mp cam produced a greater percentage of usable photos.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great specs, but user has no control over them.", "Author": "Wolfmother", "ReviewID": "R12Q0QDSIOBVNW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I bought this camera, I was excited by the low price for what was a solid focal length/optical zoom bounds choices (the 35mm film equivalent is 30mm-110mm which takes you right from the edge of wide angle to the early early beginnings of telephoto. This would be much preferable to the many 5mm-25mm equivalent cameras which boast \"5x optical zoom!\", sure 5x but over a range size that's really limited to being useful for landscape and panoramic shots.) and also what was, for cameras of this price, a good maximum aperture (an f-stop of 2.7. A lower f-stop number means higher maximum aperture. A lower f-stop number means you can get more light into camera at once, meaning you can get the same light with a faster shot. This means you can capture action faster, and also capture indoors activity.The 3\" screen was icing on the cake. Mechanical Optical Image Stabilization put it above most Kodaks in the same price range. The sensor was only 2.3 (the digital sensor itself probably much smaller) but that's standard for anything less than a few hundred dollars.Here's why I gave this two stars:The camera allows you no control over anything, and it results in worse pictures. It doesn't allow you to control aperture. It doesn't (really) allow you to control focal length because while you get to optical zoom, there's forced automatic focal-length adjustment at time of shot: the designers at Sony have decided that you don't know what you want to focus on, so the camera can decide for you. While auto focal-length adjustment can sometimes be great (taking lots of family pictures in one setting.) in 9/10 scenarios when you're composing a shot or trying to take a picture that looks like what you want it to look like, it's terrible.Please, Sony, I'm not even a professional, but I'd still like to decide how far out the camera's focus should be. Allow the auto-focus to be turned off, and allow more fine tuned adjustment of focal length and shutter speed.That's the other thing, no control over shutter speed. All of these values are either decided by the camera, or maybe you can set a \"scene\" like \"outdoors\" and instead of tying directly to a shutter speed, aperture, focal length set of values, it instead merely changes the range of values that the camera will think about when deciding what your shot should look like, and its always a wide range.And no control over aperture either. The 2.8 aperture was THE dealmaker for this camera for me, it means that I can take really good f3.3 photos (photo quality is much better at the f-stop right below the maximum aperture), but no matter what it added up to faster, brighter indoors shots. Nope. I have no control over that either. It's so frustrating, all this (relative to most consumer cameras) hardware, and sony decides that I'm only allowed to handle it with oven mitts. What's worse is that the camera half the time picks the worst value imaginable. Evening, indoors, natural light? Oh, well, a really low level of exposure of F5.0 would be great for that, right? And the image comes out all muddy.The camera's biggest problem: Most good cameras (even consumer grade, near $100 range cameras) allow you to choose what format to save your photos in (a \"data lossless\" format like PNG or TIFF where the file size is much larger, but all the data the sensor receives is kept, or a \"lossy\" format like JPG where a lot of data is dropped to save space, and the image stays the same size but becomes lower image quality). The w560 decides that you always always want JPG (it's so helpful) and not only that, you care far far more about space saved than about taking good photos. The camera calibrates the compression for saving space far more than for image quality.For example: The 16 megapixel color photos I've taken so far have all came out as JPGs of about 4 MB size. A color JPG at 16 MB will never fit into 4 MB unless you've dropped a huge amount of the data. At that point you can zoom in and all the pixels are all blocky, because essentially what you're working with is the data equivalent of a 8 MP photo scaled up to 16 MP size. But unlike an 8MP photo, you have all these visual artifacts (strange, jaggedy shapes or color modifications caused by the heavy compression), Good luck making a really nice print that's larger than a postcard with these. And on an 8.5 x 11 you might get a not bad print, but go any larger and one of the major problems with this camera, forced very lossy compression become obvious.This camera is a pile of good hardware straitjacketed in the mentality of the $40 camera you bought at CVS. If you buy a $40 camera at CVS you don't care about picture quality, you have no intention of controlling how it comes out. You just want to point, shoot, click and just have some photo, any photo, to remember the moment by. The people pay $120 for a camera do so because they want to be able to make their pictures look nice. They need to be able to use the tools to do that, rather than crossing their fingers and hoping each time the camera sees fit to use the options for them.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Make sure you get a memory card", "Author": "MovieNut \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "R207OLOYMKES4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, this is a very nice little camera.  Easy to set up and use and takes very good pictures.A word of caution.  The camera does not come with a memory card and it will not function without one. It takes two types of card: either a Memory Stick Pro Duo or an SDHC Memory Card.  The old \"Memory Stick\" cards used in older Sony cameras will NOT fit in this camera.  So either purchase a card from Amazon when you buy the camera or prepare for a trip to the store when the camera arrives (Target sells both types of cards).I recommend purchasing a second battery.  As previous reviewers have noted, the battery must be removed from the camera to be recharged - there is no provision for charging in the camera. Having a second battery available allows you to just pop it into the camera and you're ready to go. If you wish to purchase an additional battery, I can't see why you should purchase the Sony battery for $35.00 when you can purchase a generic brand, which works just fine, for about 5 bucks on Amazon (just do a search on Amazon for \"NP-BN1\").  Another reviewer commented that removing the battery reset the time and date on his camera, requiring the time and date be set up again.  I didn't have this problem.  Because I got distracted with something else, I left my camera on the table with no battery for several hours.

This time around, I have to edit every single photo with computer software to get it to look natural.4) I have now had it just over one year and even though I have never charged the battery unless it was completely dead, it doesn't last more than a couple of hours anymore.I would have returned the camera if I hadn't moved overseas.

Or so I thought.It actually ends up blurring most shots, even when I am holding still and so is my subject. I end up taking 15 pictures to get one or two that are clear and not blurry. I find myself looking at my pictures and saying gee, that would be a lovely shot IF IT WASN'T BLURRy. It seems that ONLY when the flash goes off will I get a shot that is clear. So daytime shots are out...But the thing that makes me really mad is that the zoom for this camera stinks. If you even zoom in ONE LITTLE BIT it makes for a picture that is grainy and very poor quality, even on the highest image quality settings. No matter the lighting, settings, flash or what not, if you zoom in at all your picture will look like a sand painting.And when I tried to post a review on Sony's site for this camera as soon as I rated it as less than 3 stars their site mysteriously and suddenly jumped pages and posted \"this section of reviews is no longer available\" and when I tried to revisit the site from the google link, it said it wasn't available to me.Hmmmmmm....
