When I got it, I was very disappointed with the quality of the photos. It seemed that my old 3MP camera took better quality photos. However, I learned from the camera manual that the problem lies with the camera's default settings. Here are my suggestions. When you get the camera, go into the setup mode and change the following settings. Suggestion #1 In the REC menu, turn off the digital zoom. Suggestion #2 In the QUALITY menu, change the Photo Quality from NORMAL to FINE.  From some reason Casio does not have the camera set to its optimum settings.  I am sure the negative reviews posted by people here on Amazon were made by people who did not make these minor adjustments to the camera. [...] After I made these two adjustments, I was very happy with this camera. It now takes great photos!

On a 2 day trip I took over 400 pictures and the battery is still on full. Every picture is in focus, I never have to manually focus it. It fires off pictures very quickley as long as you are not using flash. The zoom abilty is amazing. I have shown the zoomed pictures to a proffesional photographer and he was amazed. If you are looking for great indoor shots or low light get a larger camera with a larger flash. I rarely use flash and even in low light without flash I am pleased with the pictures. They are grainy but color is good and good enough for me. My purpose for the camera is outdoor scenic and macro. I am very very happy with this one. It absolutely does everything Casio says it will.

Having owned Exilim zoom cameras since the 3.2mp I have always liked the ease of use along with the small size of the Exilim cameras ( I always carry one of my Exilim with me). When I get a new one I always compare the real world use of the new camera with my previous one. When I first shot the EX-Z1000 I was impressed with the new wide screen display and the new control bar, but when I put the pictures on my screen I was very disappointed they looked very grainy so I then did a comparison between my Exilim 7.2, 8.2, and the EX-Z1000 the clear winner is the EX-Z750 followed by the Ex-Z850 and in the rear of the pack the EX-Z1000. At this time I will continue to use my 7.2 and 8.2mp Exilims and I will be giving my EX-Z1000 as a Xmas gift to someone, due to the fact I can't return the camera without a restocking fee... My final review is, skip the EX-Z1000 get the EX-Z750 its the best value, takes great pix, and the best video movies for a camera of it's size... Until the next new Casio Exilim... Have a Great Day!

While the resolution goes from 8MP on the EX-Z850 to 10MP with this one, the movie mode does not get any better (VGA) and both the photos and movies suddenly take up much more space. No I'm not talking about 10MP vs. 8MP. Compare the size of photos at 5MP from EX-Z750 vs. EX-Z1000 and the Z1000 will only be able to take 70% of the photos of the Z750 with the same size SD card. And you get 12min of movie on Z1000 where you get 22min on Z750, even though it's same 640x480 resolution. On top of that the NEWER Z1000 is 25fps while the older model is 30fps. What's up with that? It's in the fine print in the manual. Also, while the resolution is a bit better, the Z1000 comes out overly contrasty and sometimes blurry from overexposed highlights - this is shooting with identical settings and under identical conditions.

I do have the Nikon D80 set which I use for serious shooting but for quick shots and for travelling this is a great camera.The quality of the camera is very good.  Pictures are sharp (when they're focused - more on that later).  Color accuracy is very good.  I have 6MP SLR camera before and I can say that this 10.1MP is equivalent and in some cases better than the 6MP SLR.  Contrast is very good.  In fact, in sunlight it is hard to take \"bad\" pictures.  Macro pictures are great.  You'll be amazed at the results.  For what I paid for ~$300 this is a good deal.Now come some gripes...  The focusing mechanism is not always consistent.  I can shoot the same subject twice and would get one picture in focus and one out of focus (yes, I aim the focusing spot on the face of the subject first, get the green confirmation, then recompose).  This seems to happen when there is less lighting in the room which, unfortunatly is the case normally...The flash is weak.  Outside of 3~5ft range it will be useless.  When I take a picture of a group of like 20 people in a room the picture was grossly underexposed.I could never got the video feature to work but never really botherd to call Casio.  The documentation was clear and short but perhaps too short.One other thing that bothered me was the delay between pressing the shutter release button and when the picture was actually taken was long in my opinion.  I guess I was used to my Nikon D80 SLR fast release so when I use the Casio I \"mistimed\" the exposure.All in all, this is a great all-around camera to have.  Very compact.  Built solidly.

Dad and I bought 2 different cameras on the same day: he bought canon sd700IS and I bought casio ex-z1000. We took exactly the same pictures. Canon gives you a bright picture whereas casio gives you a dull quality picture. Don't get me wrong casio has a quality too but it can't compete with canon yet. And again trasfering pictures from the dock is totally awkward. It is low speed USB connection unlike canon which has high speed USB connectio. The movie clips take even longer to transfer.And again neither the movies nor the snaps come out crispy with casio ex-z1000. The only problem with canon sd700IS is that I hear a noise while using in the movie mode. The hissing sound can not be eradicated. This is not a problem with casio. Oh yeah Canon still wins over the quality of the movie clip it takes even with that hissing sound.The megapixel is promising with casio. If it says 10.1 megapixel it gives you 10.1 megapixel quality.

In pushing the resolution up to 10.1 megapixels, they lost far too much from the better 8 megapixel EX-Z850. I tried two examples, after taking the first one back. The second one proved the first wasn't defective.This thing is a red-eye machine that puts out pictures that are noisy at best, and overprocessed at worst. It has lost the manual exposure controls, the optical viewfinder and the sharpness of the EX-Z850, as well as falling behind comparably priced competitors.The oversized (but not class leading) 2.8\" LCD adjusts its brightness in response to ambient light conditions. What is disconcerting, especially in light of the missing optical viewfinder, is the screen abruptly changes brightness levels after you've framed your shot. This makes for difficult judgments on exposure.This camera does offer good manual focus adjustments, as well as 34 presets, including several for ID photos. I am uncertain how useful that would be for the average user, but if you ever need to take passport photos, I guess this camera might have an advantage for you.The video function took a step back, producing 25fps, instead of 30fps. I don't quite understand this, since the shutter if fairly quick, crisp and responsive. Even so, this camera falls short on time between shots, with a long recovery time. Turn up the resolution or turn down the lights and this thing can take an abysmal 6 seconds between shots. For this, I blame the camera's slow and insufficient onboard cache - something you cannot replace or add to.With those lights down and the camera running at ISO 400, pictures come out with very indistinct details and quite a bit of graininess. Compression artifacts and ghosts increas as the light goes down, too.The camera takes decent images in bright light, but since you're forced to rely on the LCD viewfinder, bright light photos are often difficult to frame. In low light, much of the performance is subpar, rendering images that are often unusable.The fact this camera is packed full of features and has simple controls will draw many lookers. It is a clean design, although to my eyes, not as stylish as some offerings from Panasonic, Sony or Canon. Regardless, the features and clean design don't matter if the camera doesn't take good photos and this camera really misses the mark. There are HP cameras costing less than half as much that take better pictures.Anyone who doesn't relegate this thing to expensive paperweight status doesn't know what a decent camera can do.

When I saw that the Z1000 had four more million pixels, I thought that it would give me 2/3rds more resolution, but that, sadly is not the case. The grainy pixelation is so pronounced that it looks like a PhotoShop grainy filter.The flash, as it states in the documentation, is only effective at 8 feet or less. More that that produces lots of indistinct images with lots of grain.On the positive side, if the Auto ISO default is turned off and ISO 50 or 100 is used, and if you shoot all of your subjects in the very brightest light, the images do come out looking pretty crisp.", "Date": "October 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "C.

I check my Florida telephone number and no such call was of received.  She then gave me a phone number in New Mexico.  I checked the telephone log on that telephone number and there was no such call.  A feeble excuse was then made saying it sounded as if someone answered the phone and hung up.  I retorted, if I wanted to convey information and the telephone did not operate properly I would call again.

(The Casio Tech Services rep I spoke to, while helpful, appeared to know less about the operation of this camera than I did.)While I didn't expect a full printed manual in the box, I was surprised that even a pdf version is currently (July '06) not available anywhere, here or the U.K. web sites.Here's the U.S. number to get a printed manual for this camera, when Casio finally gets its act together: 1-609-395-0154Feels to me like this launch has been rushed for some reason - to take advantage of the summer vacation selling season, perhaps?", "Date": "July 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "bad quality", "Author": "bobby \"bobby\"", "ReviewID": "RWUSX92MICQDM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the pictures are blurr. they doesnt seem like 10 MP pictures. and with this bad quality they are over sized.

Since that time, the viewer cracked and the cost of the repair was 90% of the camera's price. Then the software began to malfunction, intermittently, by that time out of warranty. I find Casio has great features on paper but after the sale service not at all satisfactory.  So, what to do? I bought a very simple 5MP Kodak Easyshare. It is interesting in the end, after weeks of research, I would choose Kodak. My brother in law had one, it was very reliable, everyone in the house could use it, and it was reasonably priced. And judging from user reviews, Kodak will turn around a broken camera in 48 hours.
