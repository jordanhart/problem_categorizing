This camera is great. It was easy to set up, but I am a Cisco engineer, so I don't know if it will be so simple for the average Joe. Anyway, the manual is detailed enough to walk someone through setting it up. The picture isn't the greatest, but for the price I cannot complain. It serves it's purpose. The controls through the browser works perfectly. I did however notice lag when I had enabled audio. This was on wireless. I have Wireless-N, but this camera has only Wireless-G. Nevertheless, I will be purchasing more of these to place in several spots in the house. I told my kids I might put one in each of their rooms. They really don't like that idea.

Contacted seller for help. He replaced camera (I paid for return shipping.) and it did not produce sound during live monitoring either. He then sent me to manufacturer. Manufacturer suggested a couple of things without success. They then asked for more info and I sent. Have not heard from them for over a week now. It is a great little camera if you don't need sound.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "works well for a year or so, has drawbacks", "Author": "P. Cahill", "ReviewID": "RZPWEJQIPZYCM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good:initial setup is not terribly hardwhen brand new, LED's provide astounding zero light imagery.web interface is easy to usebad:no way to set LED's to turn on and off automatically (via timer, fixed time, etc) so after a year or so, they will lose signifigant lighting power.I had some issues where i reset my router and could not access the cameras without power cycling them first.conclusion:Will try something different next time.  I have two of these and haven't been overly impressed after the wow-factor goes away.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hard to Rate", "Author": "M. J.

The pan and tilt are flawless. However, it is difficult to set up if you are not a computer wizz. Getting a picture was easy enough but geting wireless and remote access was near impossible. I have built several of my own systems but can't seem to make this thing work over the net yet alone within my own network. Right now it is functioning as a pricey webcam.
