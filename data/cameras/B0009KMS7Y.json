(Night/close-ups - You need to try different settings so your images do not look grainy or dark.)  The unlimited movie play/record mode (depending on your memory card) is awesome.

I am always randomly taking pictures, and end up paying to develop film with pictures that either don't turn out well, or I didn't really want... So finally, I own a digital camera.Although this is my first experience with any digital camera, I have to say that I have had ZERO problems with it.  All the pictures look great; I love the autofocus feature (beware that when this is activated, it does drain battery power); the printer dock prints beautiful pictures - just like having film professionally developed (this is a huge plus for me as well). I like that this runs independently from the computer - I haven't even hooked it up to my computer yet because I haven't needed/wanted to share pictures. I like the small size, portability, ease of use for the camera and printer, the quality of prints, the quality of the stills and video, and the variety of preferences/options for use.This would be a great camera for people who aren't highly computer literate, who don't require expensive high tech gear for professional photography, and who want good quality pictures without much hassle.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "easy to use - can't handle indoor shots", "Author": "YSI \"jaybesq\"", "ReviewID": "R2ABQK0M7UPEL3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "User interface is very easy, picture quality excellent, coloration very sharp, especially in the yellows which many cameras have trouble capturing the true brightness of a yellow.However, I'm a dad.  Which means my shots are of my four year old sweetie at graduation, my seven year old sweetie in a class play, and dozens of indoor functions and simchas.  Indoors, the pictures are flat out dark and worthless from more than six feet away even with forced flash.  The best I could do was to set the exposure (see the setting in the menu that says \"O/O\")and set it to the highest number - 2.0.  That gave me a bit more light, but it changed back to the default exposure each time I switched to video mode or shut down to conserve power.  I wish there was some way to resolve this problem as I watch all the other dads wielding cameras that don't take as sharp or as fast pictures, but have bright screens even as they preview the shot before taking it, indoors without the flash.  Did I buy this only to be an outdoor camera?  I can't play that game.  So while it is otherwise a great camera, and can take a drop to the floor to boot like most Kodaks can and most others can't, it is utterly useless to me for most of the functions I need it for.  If you are a Kodak guy reading this and there is a simple answer, please post it here.  Many others have had the same complaint.", "Date": "June 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great, versatile little camera!", "Author": "Beth Cholette \"doctor_beth\"", "ReviewID": "R2V69EUYZOT0CE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although not quite an amateur photographer, I have always loved taking pictures.  As digital technology became more popular, I clung to my film camera, a Kodak APS that I loved.  I received a cheap, no-name digital camera as a gift, and I thought that would be sufficient to handle any digital needs I might have.  Boy, was I wrong!Things changed for me when my husband bought me the Kodak EasyShare C360 and Printer Dock last Christmas.  Although I still feel a bit guilty to admit this, I love my EasyShare digital camera more than any film camera I've ever owned!  It is extremely easy to use and yet has a great variety of options.  For basic picture-taking, there is an auto feature; simply turn the dial to it and go.  However, you can also chose from several other alternatives, including action, close-up, portrait, and landscape.  In addition, the camera has a separate series of \"scene\" settings which allow you to customize your picture-taking even further--these scenes include children, beach, snow, even fireworks!  I especially like using the indoor party setting, which eliminates the poorly lit, poorly exposed indoor shots that you get with other cameras, and the self-portrait, which makes for some fun shots.  Oh, did I mention that this camera makes movies, too?  The video and sound quality is excellent.Now on to the printer dock.  The best thing about this feature is that when you are not using the camera, you simply set it back down on the printer dock to recharge.  This works perfectly for recharging the camera after relatively short (e.g., a day or two) usage periods, but for longer trips, I purchased an inexpensive battery recharger.  So far, the only time I had to swap out the batteries was when I was away for a long weekend and took several hundred pictures at my sister's wedding (and even then, the camera didn't start to lose its charge until the very end of the weekend).  The printer dock also provides an easy way to transfer the pictures from the camera to your computer, although you can print pictures directly from the camera.  I haven't used the actual print features of the printer dock very often, but when I have, I've been impressed with the high quality photos produced.The camera itself provides wonderfully clear, sharp images, whether you are just viewing them on your computer, printing from the printer dock, or printing elsewhere (e.g., the Kodak Gallery online, which is what I usually do).  The camera also offers many additional features that I don't use, such as being able to tag pictures to share.  I do use the excellent zoom, the timer function, and the burst photo option (lets you take a rapid series of pictures).  The 32 MB of memory is sufficient for casual use, but since memory cards are readily available and relatively inexpensive, I upgraded to a 1 GB memory card, which allows me almost 800 photos.  The one minor complaint I have about this camera is the accompanying EasyShare software.  Although it is convenient--especially with the ease of uploading your pictures to the online Kodak Gallery--I think it could have been much more user-friendly.Overall, however, I am thrilled with this camera and printer dock combination, and I would highly recommend it to other casual photo enthusiasts like myself!", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "jct2006", "ReviewID": "R1WOV861LTA3LW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the EasyShare c360 about a month ago.

I read that I needed to have the batteries fully-charged and it seemed to help. But, I like using an AC adapter when taking a lot of eBay photos.

I tried another one and it still ends up showing the battery symbol after a while.I have not dropped it or abused it. I have one cheaper digital camera that doesn't suck the power out of batteries, but this one won't last too long (just like my first digital camera). I even took the batteries out and tried the adapter alone and it won't stay on. AAAGGHHHH!! All this time I thought it had to do with me holding the camera downward when taking photos of small items.

It was absolutely not. The design is actually rather bulky and obtrusive compared to the other cameras on the market today. There are many exposure problems, especially indoors. It seems as though you either have a whited out face with no detail or you cant even see the face because it is not lit enough. Outdoor pictures are at best decent, which is subpar considering this is a five megapixel camera. The only plus, in my opinion, is the durability of the camera. The day I bought it I dropped it out of my car and it hit hard asphalt and there was nothing but a minor scratch on the front. This is not my first Kodak camera, but it sure is my last. I would reccomend the Canon Powershot SD630 or the Sony Cybershot DSC T10 over this camera.
