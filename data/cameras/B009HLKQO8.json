{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very cheap", "Author": "robmac", "ReviewID": "R3S22BDOBOM77M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This unit is very cheap, which is what we wanted for our 4-yr. old grandson to take pictures on vacation. It does not have an LCD to view photos after they are taken, only a small 2-character readout indicating how many shots are left to take and to set the resolution/mode. The photos have to be downloaded to a computer with special software to view (VGA resolution or lower). The software works on my wife's older MacBook but not on my newer iMac. But thats okay because the iMac doesn't travel well. The nice thing is that there were 4 interchangeable faceplates for him to chose from--he liked Ironman! It was worth it because he used the camera constantly, but its definitely not something that I expect to last a long time nor is it appropriate for someone that really wants to learn to take pictures--just something fun for the little ones.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "supermom", "ReviewID": "R25M1K294K5WQ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this for my son who wanted a digital camera SO BAD for Christmas.  (He's 5)  We got it, and it is SO cheap!  There is no screen, if he drops it it will break, and he can only take 25 pictures before you have to upload them to the computer.  No way to delete them otherwise, so I'm always uploading.  My daughter got the Disney camera and it's MUCH nicer and better made.  I'll be buying him one of those.  This is a total waste of money", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$19.00", "Features": "Can be used as a webcam\nTakes up to 120 photos or a few minutes of video\nIncludes editing software", "Name": "Avengers Digital Camera with 3 Face Plates", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BAa7aE7jL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009HLKQO8"}}
