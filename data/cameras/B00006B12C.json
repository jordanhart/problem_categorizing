{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best compact 4MP digital camera", "Author": "Man in the Middle \"strasma\"", "ReviewID": "R26DF11OMWNIIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most high-feature cameras are too large to carry with me all the time. The Pentax Optio 430, on the other hand, fits EASILY in a shirt pocket, yet includes every feature I wanted, plus its quality matches Canon and Nikon. Interestingly, smaller size and matching features and quality was also the main virtues of the Pentax I used 30 years ago over the same competitors.  I've just returned from a two week trip to Northern California, during which it took over 300 pictures. I consider many of them great...4MP means you can crop without losing visible detail. I added a Sandisk Ultra 512 Meg Compact Flash card and a spare battery, allowing me to take as many pictures as I wished each day, deleting bad ones each evening.  This camera replaced two Canons that still work well. Compared to both, I find it easier to use.  One suggestion: 1) cover the LCD with a plastic Palm screen cover. I once damaged a Canon for lack of that.  After 9 months of use, I still consider this the best small digital camera at any price. Highly recommended!", "Date": "September 13, 2002"}, {"Title": "Small enough to carry running; acceptable picture quality", "Author": "Michael David Jones", "ReviewID": "R3NQR3X2PIY5MM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cons:  Image quality is acceptable, but the inability to write tifs or raw image data hurts.  Battery life is good for about 80ish pictures w/ no flash.  It is very easy to scratch the screen (I did so on its first trip down a trail) so a PalmPilot screen protector is a must.  The movies have a nifty old-school 8mm family movie look to them.Pros: the big win for this camera is that I can carry it one hand when I run trails.  I've taken it along on 1.5 hour runs and it has performed admirably.  The camera is lighter than the water bottle I carry in my other hand.  Well-exposed 8x10s look good at arm's length (HP DeskJet 970, glossy photo paper).  5x7's look just fine.  On a recent trip to Brno, Czech Rep., the camera was very convenient for being a tourist without standing out as a tourist (as much).Context:  I've had the camera for 2 months now and shot about 400ish frames.  I've shot tripod mounted, slow film, landscape stuff for 8 years.", "Date": "September 23, 2002"}, {"Title": "This is just too cool!", "Author": "Heather \"Mommy of Two\"", "ReviewID": "RVPSQBYPIOYUO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The reviews and specs do not give this camera justice.  My favorite feature so far is the digital filter mode.  You select the filter feature, and can take pictures in black and white, and use the following filters also:  sepia, blue, red, yellow violet, and green.  There is also a slim filter, where you can elongate vertically or horizontally.In addition to the automatic mode, where you can zoom and the camera sets everything else, there is also a manual mode you can shoot in.  For those of us who enjoy manual photography but don't want to pay the price for a super expensive manual digital camera, here is a good in between.  You can set the shutter speed and aperture using the controls.You can also do continuous shooting and a night-mode is also on this camera.The 3-D feature is neat; the camera comes with a separate 3-D viewer.  I am still figuring that one out.The mini-movie (30 seconds long, no audio) is neat.  It's good for when there is lots going on at once visually (no flash; need good lighting).The zoom works quite well, also.All in all, I love this camera and would highly recommend it.I have Windows XP, and have had no problems.  The only Windows software that the software is not compatible with is Windows 95.  It comes with ACDSee, a photo editing software.  I have Roxio's Photosuite 4 Platinum, and am able to edit my pictures no problem!", "Date": "October 13, 2002"}, {"Title": "Using the Pentax 430rs", "Author": "Thomas M Witham", "ReviewID": "R3VHAG7NVZO58F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this camera.  I have been using digital cameras for several years now and this one is easy to use and takes great pictures.  The most important thing for me was size - I found that unless I could put the camera in my shirt pocket I rarely took it with me.  This on is only slightly bigger than a pack of cigerettes.  You need to buy a compact flash memory for it if you are going to take high resolution pic's as you can only get something like 8 of the highest res pictures.  The battery is a strong one and will run for a long time, and one ought to have a extra - but finding one of these new lithium ion batteries has not been easy.  You can even zoom in on a picture you have taken while reviewing it.", "Date": "December 17, 2002"}, {"Title": "Why I chose 430RS", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R36YUI429ICND8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, I went through a long long process to find a camera. I previously owned a Nikon 995 (which was GREAT, but lost in France) and know all the advantages of semi-professional cameras. But I also know size is a big factor, meaning no matter how great looking the pix are, it ain't matter if you are not carrying the camera around cuz it is too big. So I basically went with the smallest camera that has got 4MP and has got many manual funtions, and I arrived at Pentax 430RS. This camera is really small (just a tad bigger than Elph 200) but still totally pocketable. Before I bought it, I went to the store and put it in my pocket to see if it really is pocketable, and it sure was. I now carry it around like my cell phone. 430RS has got many manual funtions which can make your pix look super good, and let's not forget the 3x optical zoom and decent battery life for such compact camera. Let's face it, this camera is not gonna be Canon G2, but for the size and what you usually need it for, is pretty good. I kinda think and actually have read here and there that Casio makes this and Casio QV R4, which are identical except the memory type, kinda slicker but I saved $40-$50 by going with Pentax and I got to use my CF and CF PCMCIA Adapter which I love, don't have to carry around the USB cable anymore. And speaking of CF, make sure to get 256MB, don't waste your time with 128 cuz at the highest resolution you can't take more than 60 pix, remember this is a 4MP camera.Bottomline, it takes good pix and it is SMALL. If that is what you are looking for, 430RS is yours.", "Date": "January 30, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good form factor and picture quality", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "R3UN3OLCXAIT1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Optio takes true 4MP pictures, which are good for enlarged prints.  The image quality is good, with decent colors and slightly soft edges.  (I personally don't like sharp edges anyway.)  The form factor makes it easy to hold, and the 3X optical zoom is fast and accurate.  You can use either the LCD viewfinder or the optical viewfinder, the latter saving you considerable battery life.  A solid product that I think you'll like.

Picture quality is great, and setting are easy, very user friendly.  From Rome to Slovania, Greece and the middle east.  Hot cold didn't matter, worked great everytime and downloading the pictures is a breeze.  The camera is tiny, fits in your shirt pocket.

I seriously don't mistreat them at all, I even keep it in a hardshell case when travelling. But invariably, every six months, it goes dead, I call Pentax, they take it in, send it back to me with \"a board replaced\" and I wait six months for it to die. If it wasn't for the chronic death syndrome - it's be a great 4 star camera - it's fairly quick, has a good flash, good depth of field and really great image quality.

The price was also really competitive, only the HP 812 was cheaper but it was made of plastic... (I think they share the same optics/CCD)I found this camera extremely easy to use! The learning curve was almost inexistant. Althought there is only 6 exposure modes on the dial, I found that it was much easier to use than other cameras with 10-15 modes. You can set it with just a glimpse.The 3D mode is especially cool, it permits to create a picture made of 2 frames shot 3-5 inches apart. This stereogram when printed in the proper size can be viewed with the special glasses (included) (or without, if you are able to \"see\" them...)However, the honeymoon ended when i looked at the pictures upclose. Even when taken on a bright sunny day, pictures never achieved 4 megapixels of sharpness, more like 2 megapixels. Under lower lighting conditions (cloudy day), you could easily see noise. Also JPEG were a rather big (usually around 2600 KB) considering their lack of detail, but that was a lesser problem.In the end, i had a really hard time deciding whether i should return it or not, but i finally did. There's no point in buying a 4 MP camera, if it produces 2 MP worth of quality at twice the price and more than twice the filesize (twice less pictures on a flash card), no matter how cute and easy to use it is... So i went ahead and bought a top of the line (but still compact) Canon Powershot S45. Althought it isn't has userfriendly, it give you 4 MP worth of picture.", "Date": "April 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "It is not what one expects from 4MP camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R13LTJBXUY8KAU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1. The most important, end point - picture qulity is disappointing. For 15x10cm size pictures it is still OK (then rather buy 2MP camera and save). Digital noise is high esp. when max resolution is used. Noise is easily seen even on pictures taken under direct daylight, never mind lesser light. Compared picture quality with 2MP Nikon Coolpix 2500 - no comparison.2. Flash range 2 meters. Focus light <1 meter range.3. Auto white balance recognises only daylight, the rest must be done manually.4. Picture freezes while camera \"slowly\" adjusts focus. As the result your object might be gone. Poor light sensitivity (ISO\"max\"-200), ie. slow or no focus if light is poor.5. Strange JPG compression system - files are mutch large then taken with other cameras with the same resolution and compression degree. Higher capacity CF card required (but where is the quality for a bigger file size?).6. Features like \"3D pictures\" and \"Colour filters (to make yellow, blue etc. pictures)\" ... Who needs it???7. No TV/AV output, no sound recording, no speaker, battery needs to be removed for charging, charging time 2hrs.8.
