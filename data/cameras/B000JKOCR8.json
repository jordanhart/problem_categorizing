I upgraded to w7 x86. and no luck. I tried running in compatibility mode for all versions of windows.... I tried setting up windows xp mode... I trided using parallels AND oracle. I tried running it on an old laptop, but it wont let me save to a network path to my desktop...not even a mapped network drive. the vms dont work because of the \"virtual video adapter\" I cant install the driver for my video card because of this reason too. the support is the worst i have ever dealt with. I am currently dual booting w7 and vista... but I would like to somehow be able to load my vista partition while running windows.. is this possible? Is there a way to mod the firmare? is there software compatible with this 4 channel usb dvr??? CAN THE DAMN PEOPLE AT QSEE JUST POST A PATCH ALREADY?!??!?  worked great when I had vista tho... but I will not return to vista because of 1 piece of hardware.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Video Recorder adapter", "Author": "Kenneth Peter Watkins \"kenwat\"", "ReviewID": "R20GMR2WTNHML9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works well after contacting tech support to open ports for e-mail notification.Narrow field of view if not mounted high enough.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty good, considering the price...", "Author": "Michael D. Messer", "ReviewID": "R2YR9GJIC1H81K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this device about 9 months ago, to enable me to use my Dell PC for home security monitoring.  I started with a single camera and added a 2nd camera a few months ago.So far, the thing has worked very well.  I have it on mostly when I'm away from the house, but have been leaving it on at night a lot, especially on weekends.  No major problems so far.  Sometimes I get static & jumping in the video, but I think that's more from the camera wire runs than from the DVR device.Having 2 cameras DOES slow down the recording on each...  the playback is a lot choppier, but for security, it is fine.The motion-sensing is pretty good.  I do get a lot of hits due to insects flying around the cameras at night, and sometimes the daytime recordings have hits that I can't see any cause for, but all in all, it works well.  I've played with the sensitivity and if I have it low enough to eliminate a lot of false hits, it misses big stuff too.I've never been able to configure the e-mail notification, but wouldn't really want that, considering the false alarms.  I do use the remote viewing and it is pretty good, once you figure it out.I recommend the product to anyone needing inexpensive home security video.", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Security Cam", "Author": "Black Eyes \"Frosed\"", "ReviewID": "RGKBTHIRDWF6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Worked as expected.

Generic CD (\"RiDATA\"), from Wal-Mart, no labels, etc. and something that Windows simply cannot recognize on not one but THREE (3) different machines!

I really wanted this to work. The first thing I did was try to install the software. The disk could not be read, it didn't look like anything was even burned onto it and none of my drives could read either shiny non-marked side.  So I downloaded the software from the internet and after a few more frustrations with that, finally got it installed.  Then I hooked up my q-see cameras and it kept giving me a camera failure signal on everything. So I hooked up the q-see cameras I bought some time ago and had in use, no luck.It's junk. Save your money and your time. Up until now I have been happy with q-see, but the new cameras I bought from them show an obvious decline in quality from the ones I bought last year.

The software is really outdated, and it apparently can't fast forward. To view it over the internet it looks really bad, and you have to install a software program on the computer you are using to view it over the internet. On top of that you have to change some setting in IE because it can't verify the creator. The software also does not open properly when viewing your settings. The video looks fine, but if you go into settings half of the boxes are missing or cut short. The product does works, and is perfect for anyone that has a old computer, and wants a cheap security system.

I installed the program and hooked up the USB DVR and 4 cameras to my laptop, everything worked as advertised.  This replaced a one video channel dvr which was basically useless for more than one camera.  The QSee USB DVR is great for laptops, the software is well designed and functional.
