{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A really nice camera, with a few shortcomings", "Author": "Radu Privantu", "ReviewID": "RGIYE9SPJWGK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The SD980 camera is pretty small, and will fit in almost any pocket. Because it doesn't have any significant protrusions, it is easy to take it out of the pocket without accidentally pulling out other things as well. It feels good in the hand, and I personally don't have a problem with the lack of a hand grip or viewfinder. The body is almost all metal, and has a nice feel.Without boring you any further, let's see the cons and pros of this camera:The pros:1. 24 mm wide angle. This is very impressive, and very few compact cameras have it. What 24mm means is that you can take pictures in tighter spaces, take pictures of large groups without moving back too much, and nice landscape shots.2. The corner sharpness is great. Almost all of the other cameras that I viewed picture samples of have very soft corners at wide angles. Soft corners means that the details in the 4 corners of the picture are poor, and if you view the image at 100%, or if you need large prints, this will show.3. At ISO 80, the picture is pretty clean. Now you have to understand that most if not all the cameras that use a 12MP 1/2.3\" sensor use the same sensor, probably made by Sony. So everything else being equal, the noise is the same for all of them. What is different is how the camera tries to remove the noise (noise reduction). Even at the base ISO (80), there is some noise reduction, which gets rid of most of the noise, but with it some of the detail is lost as well. Canon generally does a pretty good job keeping most of the detail and remove most of the noise (again, at ISO 80). Each camera manufacturer does it differently, and I like the Canon way best. At higher ISOs, even at 200, the detail start disappearing, and more noise is visible. I would not use an ISO over 80, unless if I really, really have to. I'd rather have a low shutter speed and rely on the IS feature, which works pretty well, and take multiple shots hoping that at least one is good.4. Even though there are no manual controls, you still have AE (auto exposure) and AF (auto focus) locks, both in the still picture and movie mode. You will need to read the manual for how to use them, they are hard to find. AE is enabled in a different way in the still and movie mode. So with AE lock you can sort of simulate a manual shutter speed, by pointing the camera to an area that fits your needs (such as the sky or ground) and engage the AE lock.5. HD movie, which looks pretty good. It is not using MJPEG, which means that you can get a smaller file size, so more movie can be recorded on an SD card. However, the movie might not play on older (slower) computers. I didn't try to play it on a netbook, but I would not expect it to work well on netbooks.The cons:1. There is no hardcover manual. You can get it online, or from the CD that comes with the camera, but it is nice to be able to take a quick reference guide with you in the field, at least until you get used to the camera controls. They wasted a paper with stupid warnings about copyright violations and a useless \"getting started\" manual, but the hard to find things are in the PDF file. The really useful things, such as AE LOCK, AE Lock during the movie, and AF lock are very hard, if not impossible to find without the PDF file. First I thought those options are not even available in the movie mode, until I read the manual.2. The macro mode is not very useful, because the minimum focus distance is 5 CM (2\"), at 24mm. At such a wide angle, the captured area is pretty big, so you can't get very close.3. No manual controls, no RAW support. Sure, most people don't need those features, but they don't cost anything, and Canon already has them, they just decided to leave them out. The maximum shutter speed is only 15 seconds, even though it could be as high as 30 minutes. Sure, the image would be noisy, and the amp-glow would get in the way, but why not let people make their own decision whether they accept those trade-offs or not?4. You can't zoom in the movie mode. That's because the zoom motor is too loud, and it would get recorded in the movie. However, there are situations where you are not interested in the sound, so it would be nice for Canon to give more freedom to the customers.Some other things to consider:1. Even though many people think that a 5X zoom camera goes pretty far in magnifying distant objects, what the 5X means is the ration between the focal range in mm. In this case, it is 120mm/24mm. 120mm is a magnification level of just 2.4 times, compared to the human eye (which has a focal distance equivalent of ~50mm). This means that if you are interested in taking pictures of birds or wildlife, this camera might not be good for you.2. As with any other 12MP camera on a 1/2.3\" sensor, anything above the base ISO will be noisy. ISO 1600 is almost unusable, ISO 3200 is even more unusable and the image size is 1600x1200 pixels.3. The lens is pretty slow at the tele end.4. There is some low to moderate purple fringing, but better than some other cameras. I am pretty picky about purple fringing and I still like this camera.To sum it up, this is a very good camera for almost everyone, unless if you need good macro, wildlife, or low light capabilities. I really wish Amazon allowed a 10 stars system, because this camera deserves 9 out of 10. However, I am going to give it 5 stars, partially because I think that despite some of it's flaws, it is a very good camera, and partially because some previous reviewers gave it unfair ratings.[edited on October 11]Now that I ported CHDK to some extent so that I can get RAW files, it seems that the camera does some cheating.At the wide angle, the picture is cropped and some distortion correction is done, then the image is UPSAMPLED (interpolation) to 12MP. That's not very good. However, there is a good side to this, if you use the RAW image (which is pretty distorted, but can be fixed on the PC) then you get an even wider angle, about 22mm or so.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Best In Its Class!!!", "Author": "T. Le", "ReviewID": "R2O0NKG32KW62N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok so after reading so many negative reviews about this product, I decided to get my hand on one to find out. Lucky for me a close friend of mine bought it and I got a chance to run through it for a while. After playing with it for hours, I figured out that most of the negative reviews on this product are simply ridiculous and make no sense at all. So here is what I manage to work out with this spectacular camera.Starting with the EXTERIOR:The body of the SD980 is sleek, stylish, narrow and thin just like that of the SD960. It feels quite firm and durable for its size. Nothing less than SD800 or SD880 since some people mistaken this body as plastic but it is NOT plastic. The front cover and back is metallic and only the rims around camera has a rubbery feel to it. The buttons got cut short to only 2 buttons for playback and menu along with a dial like all recent SD series. So pretty much after a few minutes I got use to this camera like I was on any of the SD800 or SD880 and SD960. For those with larger hand, holding this camera with 1 hand is definitely will be somewhat of a challenge. There is a slight wavy grid near the playback button that suppose to serve as a grip but it only works for those with smaller hands. My hands are not too big or too small so I could actually use this camera with one hand without any problem.The MENU & FEATURES:Canon has replaced their menu with something new. Quite simple, pretty clear where everything suppose to be. All the shooting mode are together, ISO is easy set. Also has custom white balance nearby for those who know how to use it. Everything is push to the left side of the screen and all you have to do is scroll up and down and enter the sub menu to adjust the setting. I really like this layout since it somewhat give the camera a more stylish look on the menu instead of filling up your whole screen with menu and words. Also, Ive seen some of the previous reviews complaining about taking 2-4 steps to delete a picture. FOR GOODNESS SAKE PEOPLE READ THE ON SCREEN TIPS!!! It only take 1 easy step to delete the photo! On your playback screen, if you want to delete a photo all you have to do is press on the screen, drag your finger downward and to the left (backward L shape) and it will delete the image!!! Why would you go into the menu and go down to delete and then enter the sub-menu to delete? Ok so they DO have that option too but using the screen its not that hard! Canon made this camera so versatile that a monkey can work it. So you can scroll through the images in 3 different ways, how can ANYONE complain about that? In playback mode you can simply use the DIAL to press back and forth and navigate through the pictures the traditional way. Then you have the touch screen to slide the photo left right, tap to zoom in and double tap to zoom out. Also you got the motion sensing function, shake the camera up or down to change the image. 1 hand user can do this easily! Same for the Delete functions, there are 2 to 3 ways to can delete an image. So take your time and play with it a bit more to find out all of the functions.The TOUCHSCREEN:Canon decided to throw in a bonus touchscreen for this particular model and I must say its something new for the SD series. At first, you might have some awkward feeling since its not as sensitive as iPhone, however this is one of the more recent style of touchscreen where it require a bit more pressure so that you wont ACCIDENTALLY change any setting. Most of the phones now are this type of touchscreen not the iphone touchscreen. The recent Nokia N97 and other new phones like samsung touchscreen ones also used this kind of LCD that require a bit more pressure. After using it for a while I was already use to the touchscreen and flipping photos back and forth quite comfortably. The only problem Ive seen with the touch screen so far is the touch focus, sometime when your focus point is so small the camera dont know what you are trying to focus on but after 2 or 3 tries it does focus. Im getting the hang of it though. Again, as I was mentioning before, the touchscreen is a bonus to the dial pad, it allows you to do what a dial pad can also do but FASTER. So you can delete image, scroll through images, set flash, focus point, anything else with ease by using the touchscreen. I love this camera for this particular feature too.IMAGE QUALITY:The main portion of this review, image quality. So some of previous reviews mentioned about fuzzy photos. I dont know what you did wrong but I have my SD880, my sister's SD800 and this D980 side by side shooting the same thing. When I open them up the images is about the same!!! Sharpness is pretty much the same I would say in some cases the SD980 is sharper! and the color is more vibrant than the other 2. Noise isnt so bad at 400 as few has mentioned. You must understand this is a 12mp, so more flaws will be seen at larger size, but to downsize to the same resolution, the images from the SD980 is probably better than the SD800 at most of the time. I have some amazing shots came out during my test play with this thing. The only \"Fuzziness\" I can see is from the hand shake at slow shutter or no flash mode. But even then i rarely get those, I do have very steady hand from shooting DSLR so I can hand hold this camera at 1 sec. I just love how I can use touch focus on anything anytime and it works well for me. This thing has so much manual functions that Im starting to like it more than SD880 or SD800. So there were a few comments about not having MANUAL. So I checked the SD880 and SD800 manual functions, and this camera can do pretty much everything the same in P mode! It can set Flash, ISO, Long Shutter, EXP Compensation, Slow Sync, Shooting mode, metering, WB, Macro with touch focus is NICE, you can even set how long the long shutter can be, how many shots to take when its on timer mode! Try doing that with the SD800! With such flexible settings I can get some really good images from playing around with these features. If you've only shot AUTO and wrote a review on this camera, I think you should give the camera another look, seriously. The Video is out of the question, crisp and wicked nice! Someone said you cant zoom during video and you hear the motor of the zoom. That is WRONG! YOU CAN ZOOM, for 5x optical, you only hear the motor zooming when you kick in the Digital zoom! I always avoid digital zoom anyways. So The HD video is a plus on this thing. 24mm wide allow me to get some really nice shot, I love the wide angle shot and very useful for me in some cases. Playing with ISO 400-800 I noticed the SD800 and SD880 also have really bad noise as well. To be fair, I also tried resize all of them to the same size of 8mp and sd980 is showing some very impressing image quality at that size. They are point and shoot, obviously they aren't going to deliver amazing photos like 5DmarkII at 3200 ISO. So I think we should cut it some slack and move on with it. It's doing fine and I think this one deliver what canon promised.FINAL THOUGHT:So Ive only used this camera from my friend in approximately 2-3 hours and I manage to work out everything he was complaining about (multiple steps to delete, lack of manual, reviewing images, so forth..). Now that he learned more about his new camera he no longer complain about it. He started to use the touchscreen more often as well. I like it so much I just ordered one for myself prior to writing this review. I just think people need to give their gadgets a bit more time as they explore the thing. Just because its a point and shoot doesnt mean you can think you've figure it all out in that first 10 minutes of using it. This camera pack a lot of punch. A lot of features are there but Ive not mentioned them like how you can sort out images, favorite them, tag them, sort it out into categories and folders, and locking images so on. It's an amazing camera. As a person who shoot with a DSLR I must admit this thing is doing great. After I read so many negative reviews here I went on other professional photographers websites who own this particular camera to research more about it and there even was someone who said the image quality is so good he ignore everything else bad about the camera. So again, give it another look before you write the review. The camera was made so that you can have lots of options to work one function. I really dig the touchcreen + buttons combination, excellent thinking from Canon. Overall I give this camera a 5 because it's excellent in image quality and ease of use, battery life isnt too bad either. I also gave it a 5 since I think people who gave it a 1 is not being fair to the camera. This camera can easily take the top standing in its class.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Dissapointed", "Author": "M. Banas \"MB\"", "ReviewID": "RN2XI6ZGZZHRL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all let me just say that I really wanted to love this camera.  The design looks great, it feels solid in your hands, the wide-screen touch screen is fun to use, and the ultra wide angle lens opens up tons of creative possibilities.  Sadly I fell out of love very quickly after taking some test shots with this camera.I compared my test shots to my previous pocket cam, a 6MP Casio which produces satisfactory photos in good light and poor photos in low light conditions.I love the twilight photos I was able to take with this camera while walking around Union Square in San Francisco.  The colors were great, photos had good detail, the street lights sparkled and most of the photos came out relatively sharp thanks to the stabilized lens.  I was thrilled that the photos were much better than what I was able to produce with the Casio.Indoors in the evening the camera work just as well for such a small camera, I took very few flash photos, but all the available light photos I took in a dimly lit living room turned out very well for such a small camera.  Sure there was plenty of noise if you looked at the low light photos up close, but over all the immages were ery pleasing to the eye when viewed on a 1080P, 52\" HDTV.Then I took the camera outside on a sunny day.  Colors were decent, but the photos were very soft as if the lens were dirty.  This was especially noticeable when taking photos of trees, flowers, grass.... anything detailed looked blurred, buildings and people looked fine.  Daytime photos also lacked contrast, giving them a very flat quality.  I tired different settings, I activated the enhanced contrast setting, it helped a little.  I activated the foliage setting and it improved the detail as well, but my old Casio still produced better photos in auto mode when compared side by side on my HDTV.  I left the camera on auto ISO mode and most of the daytime photos were taken at 80 to 120 ISO.Canon made a good camera when they designed the SD980, I just think they stuffed too many pixels into such a little camera and as a result the photos are very noisy, lack detail, and exhibit poor dynamic range.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Decent camera out of the box, GREAT camera with the proper tweaks.", "Author": "M. Liquete", "ReviewID": "R2L1SKNZC7IRID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Do NOT make conclusions on this camera based on your first impressions!  After initially using this camera, I prepared a review that was going to blast it into the ground, and I was ready to return it.  I decided to hold off and play with it some more, and I'm glad I did.Background:I'm no avid photographer, nor am I a digital camera expert.  I owned a Canon SD800 for a 2+ years and loved it.  All of my friends have Canons and they were all impressive (SD550, SD790, SD1100, etc), but the SD800 was the perfect camera to me.  Perfect size, weight, comfort, speed, functionality, and durability.  It was extremely practical yet very efficient, all the while managing to look stylish and produce great results.  I've come to expect these characteristics from all Canons, so I had pretty high expectations when I bought the latest and supposed-to-be greatest in the Elph series.Picture quality:  Out of the box, you might be disappointed.  The Auto mode is underwhelming at best, and at worst, just bad in indoor/low light situations.  You might as well not even use Auto mode.  Thanks to some very helpful tips from another reviewer (\"Radu Privantu\"), with the right settings, this Digital Elph can take spectacular photos. Turn down the Sharpness and Contrast, and play around with the exposure.  Also, like Radu P pointed out in his review, your best bet is to remain in the lower ISO settings (I have great results with ISO 80).  These settings have consistently produced the best results.Long Shutter mode makes shooting good low-light photos a reality, provided you have a steady hand and a steady subject.Design:  From most angles, this camera is as sleek and stylish as any other Canon.  From the back, the overall design and specifically the button area looks very plain and almost toy-ish.  It has a nice size and weight to it (though it is slightly longer and more narrow than other cameras).  A few things though make me feel like I have to handle the camera with extreme caution.  For one, there are no distinct grooves or anything to rest against your fingers.  Also, the texture of the camera itself has very little friction or grip, so it feels like it can slip out of your hands.  At least on the SD800 I could use the mode dial as a grip point for my right thumb, but this camera has no such luxury.  There is the D-pad, but it'd be hard to use that as the grip point because I'd accidentally press a button.  I don't see myself taking too many one-handed snapshots with this one because of this.Menu system:  They swapped their old tried and true menu system (cross-style, red and black) for something that is little more aesthetically pleasing but slightly less practical.  Some things you're used to finding in one area will be found in another.  Not a problem for the most part but it may require a few extra menu sequences.  For instance, the delete function (using the D-Pad) requires a 4 button sequence (SET-->SET-->RIGHT-->SET) versus the previous 2 button sequence (DOWN-->SET, or was it DOWN-->RIGHT-->SET?).  Not a huge deal, but after using Canons for so long it might be difficult to adjust.Also worth noting, navigating through the menus or scrolling through photos is not as snappy as previous Elphs.Touchscreen:  I'm not crazy about touchscreen gadgets myself because of how impractical they are versus a set of keys or buttons.  That said, I found it functional and efficient for the most part.  I opted for the SD980 because it offered both the D-Pad and the touchscreen controls (kudos to Canon for that), but I do prefer using the D-Pad.  I didn't have any problem bouncing back and forth between the two like some online reviews said they did.I originally wanted to call the touchscreen what it is, a blatant gimmick... But it's much more than that.  The touch focus feature is a godsend!  Great for shots that you can't count on the autofocus to render.  The touchscreen also allows for some on-the-fly adjustments, such as exposure, though I wish they would've utilized more of the screen real estate (along the black side bars) to add more on-the-fly adjustments.  Would've liked more flexibility with the four Street Fighter-esque playback gestures.  They're customizable, but they don't offer a large array of options you can set it to.The LCD quality is average.  At 3\" you expect to be blown away with a bright, crisp picture, but output can be fuzzy.  This is to be expected though, and it is how most touchscreen gadgets are.The screen itself is a smudge magnet. And it doesn't sink in very far from the surface of the camera, leaving it more vulnerable to scratches.  Not sure how scratch-resistant it is but I'm not going to use mine to test it ;).  I bought a 3\" screen protector but it ended up being way too small, so be wary of purchasing one.There is also some light bleeding out of the edges of the screen.  Not really noticeable unless the onscreen picture is dark.Active Display:  Useless piece of technology.  I'd rather Canon not waste their time and effort to give us the ability to flick our camera around like a Wii remote just to scroll to the next image.  It takes impractical to a whole new level.  Yeah, it will ooh and ahh your friends, but I could never imagine using it when I just want to scroll through pictures.  Especially taking into account that the camera has little grip (and it's not like you're always going to have the wriststrap on at all times).  Someone just might end up tossing this thing into a wall.  This feature doesn't directly take anything away from the product, and you can even turn it off, but I'd rather Canon put their efforts towards something a bit more useful.Battery life:  Decent, but haven't taken it through a real world test of all-day use.  So far, I'd say it's what you'd expect in battery life when dealing with a large touchscreen and HD video.  Something else to note is that the battery and in turn the camera get HOT.  Not burning hot, but I don't remember older Canons getting this hot.Video:  Pretty HD.  It does what it needs to do.  Contrary to popular belief, (1) you CAN zoom, and (2) you can record longer than 10 minutes, depending on the size of your memory card of course.  Also something to note, the sound that is recorded while operating the zoom dial isn't a dealbreaker, but know that it is there and it is noticeable.Final thoughts:The Canon SD980 does have some shortcomings, but it also does a ton of things right.  Any product should perform at its best right out of the box, but don't let that take away too much from what this product's best could be with the right tweaks, because it stands up admirably against other upper tier point-n-shoots.  The touchscreen turned out to be more than just a gimmick, with 'touch focus' being the best feature any of the Digital Elphs have to offer, IMO.I recommend this camera to anyone WILLING to give it a chance and not write it off after the first 10 minutes of use.  You won't regret it.Other thoughts:I think many of the bad reviews out there are a bit unfair.  Does it really deserve 1 out of 5 stars just because it doesn't meet YOUR expectations?  Only an off-brand Walmart-exclusive camera that takes no better pictures than my cell phone should warrant a 1 star rating.  Taking into consideration what this camera offers compared to other PnS cameras with similar specs, no legitimate review should be under 3 stars.  I know everyone has their own opinion, but look at it realistically.  If you feel this camera deserves 1 star or even 2, what would you rate the aforementioned off-brand Walmart camera?  Please use perspective when reviewing. I officially rate this camera a 4/5, but I'm going to give it a 5 to balance out the ridiculous 1-star ratings.***EDIT 9/17/09 - Uploaded some sample pictures to Amazon's gallery.

Some give 1 star, some give 4 or 5. Sharp pictures . . . terrible pictures. Which is it? Here's the scoop:In \"Auto\" mode, the camera chooses the ISO setting and that cannot be defeated. Unfortunately, the camera chose ~ISO 640 for all the test indoor flash pictures I took on Auto. These grainy images are far inferior to, say, the crisp, sharp images from the SD800is that I also have . . . er, well, had :(.Note that using \"P\" mode and forcing ISO 80 gave very sharp images, comparable in all respects to those I took with the SD800is.But user control of ISO is only available in Shooting Mode using settings \"P\" and \"Long Shutter\". As a result, the graininess and quality of images in *ALL* other modes is unpredictable at best, and uniformly bad at worst.The SD980is is in desperate need of a firmware update allowing the user to set the ISO or the maximum ISO range to be used in *any* mode. It may also be possible for the camera to give a warning if it would have chosen a higher ISO, and allow the user to either shoot or accept the camera's choice.Pros: On the plus side, the camera has many very nice features (eg, touch focus), what seems to be a good optical system, and a wide angle range that should make this camera the ideal travel companion. OTOH, Canon has gone from providing piles of paper manuals in multiple languages to none - just the CD versions. If you want to learn about the camera, either study up at home or bring your laptop with you.My opinion: Unfortunately, the absence of effective user control over ISO and the resulting uncertainty and/or inferior images makes the SD980is \"unacceptable\".", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love the wide angle.", "Author": "S.

Cheung \"hahaha48\"", "ReviewID": "RLNVDR0NS8QOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am going to give this camera 5 star for small digital camera that sells for $279. I have own a few small digital camera all Canon and the last one was sd1000 and 790. I also own a couple Rebels with 4 expensive zoom lens > $500 each and one professional zoom lens >$1000.I bought this camera after reading all those negative reviews and then some positive ones that explain why this camera is great for it's price and size and why those negative reviews are not fair. I'll first address the negative reviews for this camera before I get into what features and functions I like.First of all let me give the negative reviewers their fair share first. If you are looking for a simple point and shoot camera without wanting to use the slightly more complicated mode of this camera then you should buy another camera that is either a lot cheaper or have a better auto mode. The one major flaw of the auto mode in this camera is it chooses too high an ISO value (I believe 250 is the lowest ISO in auto mode). With high ISO you have more noise in the picture. I do understand why Canon chooses a high ISO value for the auto mode. With a high ISO value you can make the shutter speed faster which will give you better picture either if you do not have study hands or taking picture of a moving object. Since it is an auto mode Canon cannot let the user changes the ISO value. But as other reviewers have pointed out you can almost do the same if you just select the \"P\" mode and mix the ISO values to what you like (80 is the lowest and has the least amount of noise)I did a study at a parking lot with cloudy sky around 3pm. I choose the \"P\" mode and tested all the ISO values from 80,100 to 1600. I did two test one taking a picture of the front of a bank and another taking picture of the road with cars coming from my left which is going about 20 to 35 mph.  The picture of a fix front of the bank shows the best one are the lowest ISO 80. The difference between ISO 80 and ISO 100 is seen when I use Photoshop to look at the picture by pixels. The ISO 80 definitely has less noise then ISO 100 but it also has a little bit more color distortion. May be the camera corrected some of the color distortion in ISO 100 and thus introduces a little bit more noise. For 4 inches by 6 inches prints all ISO values are great. For 18 inches by 24 inches you can see a small amount of noise starting at ISO 400.My second set taking pictures of slow moving cars with some buildings in the background reviews why Canon chooses higher ISO for auto mode. The fix background result is the same as my first test. The moving car is another story. When you enlarge the picture to look at license plates you cannot see the numbers or letters with ISO 80 to 200. You can see the numbers and letters starting at ISO 400 and gets better and better up to ISO 1600. AT ISO400 the shutter speed is 1/500. For a lot of the point and shoot users they probably do not enlarge their pictures often so at ISO 250 they will not see any difference. But if at auto mode it can go down to ISO 100 then any picture with a moving object will give you a blur picture.Also when you compare picture quality with other cameras you must use the same focal length. This camera has a 5x zoom and a range of 24 to 120 mm. So the wide angle is most likely wider than most other cameras and also the distant zoom. The two ends of the range will give you more distortion. As another reviewer said he compared the picture quality of this camera with many other small digital cameras using the same focal length and he find this camera's picture quality is at least as good as any of the other cameras.Physically the 980 is slightly narrower than the 1000 but about \u00bd inch longer. It weight about the same. Due to the 3 inches LCD display taking most of the areas at the back of the camera it removed the view finder and move 2 other switches to another part of the camera.The best part of this camera over most of others is the wide angle and the 5X zoom.The touch screen is new to me for Canon. I have used one before for a video hand held player. I found it to be excellent. I am using it to display pictures and delete pictures. I have tried the touch focus and it is very good. The display screen is large and it uses both side as buttons you can select stuff.The battery life is average. Please do not buy Canon brand battery, you can pick up an off brand battery for 6 to 20 dollars. The Canon battery is 1000mah. You can get one for about 6 dollars and they are just as good as the Canon one. If you want a better battery (1200 mah) You can get it for less than 20 dollars. There is a display that shows you how much battery power you have left in your camera.The best buy for memory card is SDHC. Most people use the 8G version and I like the 16G version. Get a fast memory card (class 6 or better). If you spent 300 dollars for this camera do not buy a cheap off brand memory card. I bought one a few months ago (adata 16g) and it die when I arrived in Hong Kong airport. I have to buy another memory card at a premium for my trip. I am not sure about buffers in this camera but even with class 6 memory card it takes almost one second to shoot between frames. My rebel have 32 meg buffer so speed of the memory card is not as important when you shoot multiple frames.Date and time has a traveling time zone and a home time zone.There are many special modes other then \"P\" and I use the Night Snapshot the most. This basically is a slow shutter speed to make the background brighter so that your people will be bright using the flash and the background is also somewhat recognizable.  This camera has one other features that is similar to night snapshot. It is slow synch which you can select from the flash and it is similar to night snapshot.There is a check for shut eyesI have check out the movie mode and it took movies in my bed room with limited amount of light very well. You can zoom in the middle of your shots. I always turn off digital zoom when I use my camera. When taking still picture I always use photoshop for any cropping.There are many more very complicated features and functions and I do not think I'll use too many of them. Things like custom white balancing, editing pictures, printing pictures, and display on a HD monitor or TV etc.Lastly please use the Canon software to load the pictures to your PC. It automatically create a folder for each day. When you have thousands of pictures a year the best way is to store them by date. Also you can select file directory for each day in this camera.addition after a 20 day travelling in 4 countries and 5 days cruise shipsunset mode is great and give you a great filter effect.aquarium mode is also good for a picture at Vancouver airport.Wide angle is great for at least 3 situations where other people cannot take a picture that covers the scene.Indoor use with flash is no compitition against my dslr with professional flash.Picture with bright sun at the back (using flash) has exposure too bright.In general even with windows and bright light at the back picture do not look good.tips for quick processing of over 1000 pictures in photoshop:-Go through all the pictures and delete those you do not want quickly with bridge.Select those that has too bright or too dark area and fix them using shadow/highlightThen record an action using auto level, auto color, auto contract, auto tone and unsharp mask 150% 4 pic and 1 thresholdRun all the pictures using the action.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "I finally found the right camera!", "Author": "K.

The camera exceeded my expectations and delivered great images. I was really happy with the colors it produced. There are situations that the sharpness is a litte soft-- especially with the zoom and/or if you are trying to crop into the shot tight, but over-all the images are great. The wide angle is awesome!The touch screen UI worked well and was pretty cool. However-- I found it was quicker to use the dedicated buttons on the right for quicker/tactile access to common features. I love it that this camera still has these buttons compared to the newer model which is all touch-screen.I was also very happy with the video quality. The 720p clips looks great. I cut them into my 1080i HDV footage and it's hard to tell the difference. Zoom while shooting is digital and should be avoided.I bought several extra batteries too, but I was pleased that I really only needed one extra as each battery lasted 7 days (about 500 pics) while in the wilderness.

Not a metal body but who cares, this is a (very) high quality polymer body, the buttons, levers and wheels all work and feel great, just as they should, as we're used to expect from the SD series by now. Best in class, no doubt about it.(+) The 24mm (equivalent) focal length is sweet :) the SD980 is one of the first compacts to come this wide AFAIK, it's simply nice, it works, I have nothing much to add. I have also tried the Panasonic DMC-ZS3 which has similarly wide angle end, much better tele end and video recording capabilities, but for me the SD980 works better - I don't care so much for strong tele or video, and I preferred Canon's more compact and better build body.(+) Long exposure mode works great. Somewhat inconvenient UI to get to it but once you do, it simply works very nicely.(+) Battery life: not bad at all as far as I can say. I don't shoot video much, that's where possibly battery life could be a tougher issue, but with stills, I never ran into problems or dead battery situations. Last SD that I had before that is the SD400. The SD980 battery life is much better.(+) Responsiveness. no annoying lags or delays.(=) No optical viewfinder. Again who cares, the LCD screen is very clear, it does not seem drain the battery that much. I don't miss the viewfinder.(=) Touch screen. I don't dig it, perhaps some folks would. I tried using it for a few weeks, nice toy but not much more than that for me. Ended up returning to button controls and not using the touchscreen at all. There's nothing wrong with the physical properties of it - AFAICT the sensitivity is OK, it's just that the whole control scheme through the touchscreen isn't that great. To me it looks as if the whole touchscreen user interface concept isn't fully baked on Canon's bahalf. Perhaps in a year or two they will figure out how it should all play together (as they did with real buttons and wheels) and then touchscreen will be a viable alternative or addition to normal controls but till then it just isn't it. Good thing the kept the buttons and wheels :)(=) Built in flash. Didn't try it that much. I never do on compacts, not a consideration for me at all.(-) Low light image photography. as expected from a small sensor camera, the SD980 exhibits the typical (high) noise levels in dim lighting conditions. If this is important to you then you need a DSLR. Micro four thirds systems, and perhaps Caonon's own S90 or G11 would do a better job. Still no magic here - small sensor equals poor sensitivity. The SD980 isn't worse than other digital P&ss; in that respect - they all perform poorly in low available light.Buy it if: you are looking for a compact camera, with wide angle zoom, long exposure modes and high build quality.Don't buy if: you're keen on shooting videos, or telescopic lens photography (there are better compacts for that out there).

SD940 has the mic in front of the camera and does not have this problem.Another design flaw is that the tripod mount hole is too shallow.

Long story short, after researching the Cannon 980IS, I decided to make the buy.  The features were right, reviews from the more noteworthy sites like CNET were right, and the price was right ($295).

Halfway into my vacation I flew from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, Thailand for some adventure seeking.  I reserved a nice little room on the second floor of an inexpensive boutique hotel on the Ping River.  The area was beautiful.  Wanting to take some pictures of the hotel I headed outside.  My camera case was open & upside down as I walked outside my room.  My camera slipped out & fell a full story, hitting some hard wood steps.  It then bounced & fell another story, and landed on a concrete surface.  I won't repeat my words, when I made this careless mistake.  The camera should have been in pieces.  Instead the case was dented, scarred, scuffed & scratched.  The front was slightly separated from the back.  I squeezed it shut; it snapped back into place.  And the touch screen had a little light (when the camera was on) shinning from the back.  However, after a two-story drop test, the camera still took the same quality pictures and video for the last four days of my trip as it did for the first five days.

Tons of noise and even if you force the camera to ISO 80, you get less noise but the images still aren't very sharp. Wide shots also suffer from a lack of detail along the edges.

VERY Poor 'Evaluative', 'Center Weighted' or 'Spot' light metering. If using the flash, the camera creates a halo around lit up or white objects as well as light streaks emanating from concentrated light sources (even recessed ceiling lights).4. The 24mm Wide Angle as default at startup is poor design.  objects at the edges are therefore always distorted by default.

This gives the 980 greater versatility in, for example, scooping in a building interior or closing with a distant soccer player.  At the shortest (widest) focal length, the 980's image quality is marred by barrel distortion more glaring than typical in this class of camera.  Having tested the 980 side-by-side with the 780, I can say that the 980 is not, in fact, \"worse\" -- at a given focal length, that is.  It's just worse when the lens is racked into focal lengths which the 780 can't reach.  Hence, versatility with a cost.  At mid- and long focal lengths, the 980 and 780 are comparable as to image quality, and therefore to any recent Canon issue in this rapidly-churning product class.But since these cameras default to their shortest focal lengths when turned on, many or most of the typical user's snapshots will be taken in this state of excessive barrel distortion.

However here are a few \"rules of thumb\" should give you better pictures.1)  Use the lowest ISO available given your requirement for either aperture or shutter speed.  To avoid getting technical, higher ISO always introduces higher noise. At issue is when it becomes noticeable.  In newer dSLR cameras you can get over 1000, maybe well over depending on the camera, before the noise becomes noticeable.  For this camera keeping it at or below 200 is a good idea.2)  Don't use in-camera sharpening.  Digital pictures will almost always benefit from sharpening but you are better off doing it as part of post processing with something like Adobe Photoshop Elements & Premiere Elements 7 [OLD VERSION] or ACDSee Photo Manager 2009.

Nelson", "ReviewID": "R2HS58OEZY7FT1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the Canon SD 980 IS and a SanDisk 8GB Extreme SDHC a couple of months ago. It was to replace a ten year old Olympus D460 Zoom (1.3 Mpix, 3X optical zoom, 32MB Smartcard), not because the Olympus was doing badly, it just seemed big and heavy for the features and that inhibited me from carrying it around most of the time. To motivate me to carry a camera, I decided I wanted something the size of a deck of cards, 5X optical zoom and SDHC media - I assumed that \"point & shoot\" meant exactly that, a bad assumption. Upon looking at options, the 12 Mpix sensors on most models with 5X zoom made me nervous and I should have listened to my gut. The 12.1 Mpix sensor on the Canon does not appear capable of taking sharp fotos.  In any Oranges to Oranges comparison, the old Olympus is sharper. The 5 Mpix camera on our Samsung Galaxy S Android phone is far sharper then the Canon in comparable situations. Given Canon's reputation for quality optics, as well as friends' results from older Canons, I have to conclude Canon is trying to cram too much into their sensor and it shows. Secondly, I - and I believe most digital camera users - use a PC or Mac to view the fotos and clean them up. the software comes free and usually does about 90% of what I want to do. In the other 10%, I revert to Paint.NET software, also free.In the SD 980 IS, it seems Canon is trying to cram the equivalent of \"Microsoft Windows Live Photo Gallery\" into the camera. Presumably Canon thinks many new customers will not have a PC or Mac and they can sell these neophytes a camera and printer without an intervening PC with imaging software. This attempt results in a horribly complex User Interface in the SD 980. If the 30 days return date hadn't expired during the holidays, I would have shipped this camera back.Now I have to decide if I want to spend several hours with the Tech Manual (comes as pdf on the CD-ROM, not printed) setting all the \"automatic point and shoot\" defaults to something that doesn't overwork the sensor or the internal camera controller chip. Other option  just eat the difference, sell this donkey and find something that really comes closer to what I want.

The past three digital cameras I purchased I did without research and ended up severely disappointed. I read a lot of different reviews before settling on this one. Some highlights:- For basic functions, it's easy to use. However, using some of the specific settings can be a little complicated and may require you to look at the digital manual.- The touchscreen focus is a unique and wonderful feature. The detection on the camera itself makes this feature unnecessary most of the time, but it's great to have when you do need it. It may be a bit frustrating if you move the camera around or your subject moves and you need to re-focus.- The touchscreen for other features (not focus) is great. In an evolving world where we fondle our technology (think smartphones), it makes this camera cutting edge. It's incredibly easy to use - even my not-so-tech-savvy parents found the touchscreen interface easy to use.- Takes great pictures, even in low-light situations.- The different scenes help you capture the perfect picture, and there's a lot of fun features to add a spark of flare to any picture.- Lithium battery with it's own charger, great battery life.- Lightweight and compact. Sleek design, doesn't feel bulky or clumsy. I take it with me everywhere - you never know when you'll see something you want to snap a picture of!I was a long-term Kodak fan - no more!

I wish the sensor was divided up into fewer pixels to reduce low-light noise.  The pixel war has sacrificed low-light performance for bright-light resolution which is an out-dated compromise now that there are enough pixels.Strengths:- Does a great job on Auto.- The HD movies are great for a digital camera (good reason to pick this camera)- I like the touch screen, especially the touch-focus feature (good reason to pick this camera)- 24mm wide- 120mm optical tele- Pocketability- Bright light resolution- Nice size HD-aspect LCD screen- Good software pack- Nice looking cameraWeaknesses:- Occasional very slow shutter release, worse with flash- Movies only allow digital zoom--can get chunky- Menu/navigation system is unnecessarily convoluted- Exposure is a bit inconsistent- Low light noise.  Maybe I'm too used to the 5D, which has 12MP on a 9 square centimeter sensor.  This camera also has 12MP, but the sensor area is 1/4th of a square centimeter.  That gives an idea of how hard this little camera is packing electrons together compared to the best low light digital SLR.- Because of the low light noise, you need to use lowest possible ISO with the flash.  That limits flash range, lights the foreground too brightly, and overpowers ambient light which is the key to getting great low light shots.  You can still get capture ambient light for a nicer looking overall photo if you accept the noise at higher ISOs.- Need a second battery- PriceyA pricey compact with lots of modern features and good performance.

Not the case.After preparing the camera, I began to take test shots to learn the features. Quickly found that my grownup man's hands had a real challenge holding this little device. I really found no comfortable, natural way to hold it. Not kidding.720p video is very nice, good for short movies on the go. I have a Canon SD camcorder, which is much more appropriate for video. I then took lots of still pictures, they stunk. I read the entire manual on pdf and picture taking didn't improve. Then, per advice from reviews here, set to the 2nd highest MP setting (8MP) and tried all the scene types. Tons of blurry pictures. Had an anole (small salamander) on the front porch and this camera would not focus no matter what, even in macro. Also, I could not accurately slide the teeny tiny buttons. Last straw was a vertical purplish series of bands that would appear whenever there was indirect sunlight present in the frame. I could not make this camera work for stills and after 6 days, returned the unit. This guy was miserable with the 980.As a note, I am a major fan of Canon so I bought an A1100 PowerShot instead.

The zoom lens has decent reach at 5x optical zoom.3. Low light pictures. I have been able to get several excellent pictures during the night with the slow synchro flash setting. The Image Stabilization is pretty good allowing to take pictures at low shutter speeds with good clarity.4. Very good Auto mode. But, if you do decide to get this camera I would recommend to go beyond the Auto mode and explore the different options to get the best possible picture.

Indoor pictures are relatively grainy (ISO is 500+ on most even with the flash) and outdoor pictures look washed out. I compared the pictures to a 870 IS and the 870 came out ahead 5 out of 6 times (Not a scientific test, but both were with similar setings and mounted on a tripod and shot with a 2 second time delay to eliminate hand shake, ISO 200 on both cameras).Granted, as I've only used a Canon 30D DSLR with pretty decent lenses for the last few years, but I didn't think that the pictures from my 7-year old 4MP Konica KD400Z were awful. (A lot of the ones from this camera are just awful)The HD video is pretty good and even the 640x480 movies look decent on a 47 inch tv - so high marks for that.The touchscreen is pretty useful but it would have been nice to be able to assign any camera function to the 4 allowed 'gestures'. It is great for touch-focussing on 'this-one' and it holds the focus point pretty well as you pan the camera. All in all, I like the touchscreen.The 'click wheel' is very well implemented (much better than my Canon HG10 HD vid cam) and is nice and responsive. I have a gripe about the tiny triangular on/off button as it is not responsive on the narrow side, but that is a minor inconvenience.I'll play with this a bit more (Reset to factory settings; turn off some of the 'Smart' functions etc) and see if I can get the picture quality to improve. Othewise I'll be looking closely at the S90 - even though that doesn't have HD video capture (whose bright idea was that? The S90 product manager should be taken out and flogged for descoping HD video).Update: 9/18After about 200 pictures (mundane items like backyard, traffic, animals at the zoo etc.) over the last couple of weeks, I've figured out some combinations that allow for a decent image. For those who have this camera, a possible starting point would be: Fixed ISO 80, White balance - Cloudy (check out the Custom White Balance - can get you really freaky colors), Custom Colors with sharpness dialed all the way down and custom exposure between -2/3 and +2/3 depending on lighting conditions.If the above is gibberish to you, DO NOT buy this camera. The Auto mode is really bad in anything but near perfect conditions.The main reason for me to get a point and Shoot camera was not to fiddle with all these settings, so I'm not still holding the rating to 3 stars. There's something very wrong if it takes longer to get a half decent picture out of this P&S; than out of a DSLR.... and irrespective of what others say this camera does NOT ALLOW you to ZOOM WHILE TAKING VIDEOS.

Needless to say, poor customer service for spending that much on a camera.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Video breaks up on download to PC, customer support blames apple, windows etc", "Author": "Famous Five \"smileman\"", "ReviewID": "RSANHKRKBIPZG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the video breaks up when i download to pc and try to view it in apple quick time.
