I chose it because it uses AA batteries as opposed to having to plug it in and recharge it after every use.The only complaint I have about it is that when I record a movie, a set of two AA batteries is drained in about 2-3 minutes.  There is a slot for an AC adapter, but the product doesn't come with an AC adapter.  The adapter is nearly impossible to find online.  I say \"nearly\" because I haven't been able to find it on a handfull of online retailers.  I am beginning to think it is just a fabled legend.  Vivitar UK sells it online, but it is listed in British currency.  As far as purchasing it from a US retailer, I have not yet found one.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000FPY7TA"}}
