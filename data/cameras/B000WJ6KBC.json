Please learn from my headache.", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "RM2TF4942ZVJ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this isn't the first time I have used this model, but it is the first time with the firmware 5.PKT1.  This module ships with the 5.PKT1 firmware, which you are not told when buying it.  To Amazon, I give 2 stars.  At least got the model correct, and stated it was for a Toyota.  Anyway.  I install this in my 2010 Tundra, first with T-taps, then when that didn't work, I soldered the connections following directly the install manual, and still didn't work, and yes, I tried both primary keys.  The LED would flash like it was receiving the key code, but would flash for 30 seconds and return to a solid light.  I started to think I had a defective unit, but luckily I had a shop near me that was willing to help, and they re-flashed the original firmware with the same, and it still didn't work.  So after several attempts, I had them change the firmware to PKT2, and all works perfect. Though it does require a completely different way of wiring it up.  If you ask me, the transponder in Toyota's (Tundra at least) are to weak to work with the original firmware.  So if you order this, beware, that you might have to play around with it as I did, and hopefully you have a local shop with a XKLoader to help you, or own one of your own.  Honestly, you can get this module, and the XKLoader2 for less then just the module at \"Worst Buy\".", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Works great, and best price at Amazon", "Author": "Shawn \"Shawn in Raleigh, NC\"", "ReviewID": "R26I4D96XV0ERL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Comes with the PKT1 interface software, which is what I needed for my 2008 Toyota 4Runner. Simple hookup...just 5 wires (power, ground, data receive, data transmit, and trigger). I installed it myself. This unit is small -- about the size of a matchbox. It has clear instructions.The programming step took me 3 tries to get the timing right, but I think that was my fault. Works great! And the price at Amazon is half what other sites are selling it for.Overall a much better solution to key-transponder engine immobilizer bypass than some of the products that require you to seal one of your master keys in a box under the dash, or install a transmitter near, or another ring around, your ignition switch. This unit just intercepts the digital keycode the first time you use it (during the programming step) over the car's own data wires, stores it, and then transmits the code at the correct time (when your remote starter is triggered) over the car's own data wires thereafter.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Description is incorrect.", "Author": "Brian Bayliss", "ReviewID": "R16SG7U71D67UV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This does not work with all late model Toyota's as advertised.
