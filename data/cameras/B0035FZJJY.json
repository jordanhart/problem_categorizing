{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Canon SD1400IS is Capable & Compact", "Author": "SDesign", "ReviewID": "R18AK07I9S04FH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In short, this is a great camera in a very small package that produces good results! I wanted a small portable camera with HD video capabilities that I could take with me when I did not want to lug around my DSLR (Canon 40D + lenses) and this little gem fits the bill perfectly.This camera replaced a Canon PowerShot SD780IS (Black) that I returned due to constant audio noise (hum) while recording video. Rather than risk getting another defective SD780IS with the same issue (many seem to report hearing the noise/hum), I decided to upgrade to the latest Canon PowerShot SD1400IS (Black). I am happy to report that this camera has no such issue with audio when video is being recorded.The picture quality of the SD780IS and SD1400IS is roughly the same and on par with what one should expect from such a small ultra-portable camera. Going from 12MP to 14MP is a wash as the sensor is the same size and results are very similar. I have posted several shots of flowers under the \"customer images\" section of the Canon PowerShot SD1400IS 14.1 MP (Black) and also uploaded several 100% crops of each image so pixel peepers can see the detail that this camera produces.Let me be clear, anyone that thinks this camera is going to produce anything close to the quality of a DSLR is fooling himself or herself. There is no way that this small of a package (3.6 x 0.7 x 2.2 inches ; 4.6 ounces) can produce the same image quality as a DSLR. If image quality if paramount, one would be better off considering the Canon PowerShot S90 10MP Digital Camera, but you will lose the HD video capability, some portability and spend more money. When I want extreme quality, I simply take my Canon 40D + lenses with me and shoot in RAW.The Auto mode is smart and I think there is more happening behind the scenes than one would expect. If one takes the same image (same ISO settings, lighting, shutter etc.) in Auto and then in Program mode, the results are similar, but I think the Auto mode wins nearly every time. I have no way to confirm this, but the Auto mode seems to have different compression algorithms depending on the subject and can produce a less noisy image at higher ISO than Program mode can. Inside shots are good but I wish I could set an ISO range to force the Auto mode not to exceed 400 ISO.Tip: If you are getting blurry images, remember that the minimum focal length is much less 5cm when at 28mm and significantly more 50cm when zoomed in to 112mm. So, if you are trying to get the camera close to your subject, be sure to gauge your zoom/subject distances properly otherwise your subject will be out of focus. Perhaps this would have helped the 1 star reviewer.Final items of note:1. There is no viewfinder and quite honestly, the small viewfinder on the SD780IS was useless so I do not miss having one. The LCD is bright and works great even on bright days.2. There is no optical zoom while recording video, only digital zoom, so one has to decide on a zoom length before starting to record. This is a non-issue for me as many people overuse zoom and usually would have been better off just recording a static shot rather than making me dizzy with shaky-cam + zooming at the same time.Bottom line: This is a fantastic pocket camera capable of decent images with HD video recording as a bonus. It is small enough that it will get taken everywhere enabling capturing of all those special moments. I would highly recommend it to anyone, so long as they realize the limitations inherent to ultra compact cameras. I hope this is review is helpful.Update: I forgot to mention that one should be sure to get no less than a \"Class 4\" SD card (Class 6 would be even better) to prevent any video recording issues (missed frames etc.)Update 2: Still loving this camera after six weeks of use, I particularly like HD video capabilities and use it all the time. The .mov video files make for easy import into Apple iMovie for editing and produces great results. At a recent event, I was able to get some very nice pictures in low light without using a flash in AUTO mode. I was really surprised at the quality achieved in such hard shooting conditions. Best results are had by not zooming too much as there is less light available (f-stop changes when zoomed). If you are noticing blurry shots, try to zoom less and get closer to your subject.Update 3: I just ran across the recent announcement of the Canon PowerShot SD4000IS (Black) 10MP, it was just released and the list price is currently more than the SD1400IS but the new 10MP back-illuminated CMOS sensor looks very promising for decreasing the noise that is common in sub-compact cameras. The SD4000IS also has HD video capabilities with the addition of stereo sound and can be zoomed while recording video along with a new \"Super Slow Motion\" video function and a faster f/2.0 lens. It will be interesting to see what users think of this new camera in the coming months. I hope this update is helpful.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best camera for the money!!  Get the waterproof case!!", "Author": "RunKidsx3", "ReviewID": "R1A8C7PX17SATR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a scuba diving trip in the Caribbean.  This is my first product review, but I was so impressed with this camera, I have to do one!!  We bought the underwater case to go with it so we could take it diving with us.  The camera was amazing.  I am just a recreational photographer (taking pictures of kids, sports and hobbies.  The 1400 took amazing photos of fish, eels, and other creatures between the depths of 1 ft- 100ft.  Some pics still turned out a little blue, while others turned out so well I think they could be published.  Underwater photography is very hard, I have heard because of so many variables.  I rarely get blurry pictures on land or underwater.  Sometimes if the first is blurry I quickly change setting and the 2nd is not.  I took several pictures while chasing fish or stingrays and 99.9% were not blurry.  I don't think you can ask more than that out of a point and shoot!Indoors the colors are very real.  I do not find yellow tints to pictures. I was taking pictures of the kids around the dinner table, (which has a big window next too it) and the kids looked great.  Usually with past cameras they turned out dark because of the light coming in through the window.  Outdoors the pictures are beautiful.  Again you may have to change the setting, but it is easy.  If the water was not turquoise enough, I changed it to beach setting and the pictures showed every detail.  I cannot say enough about this camera, but I think every night on our vacation we just talked about how amazed we were with it.  I studied hard before buying this camera.  I spent many hours looking between the 780, 940, 1300 and 1400.  For a few dollars more you get a lot more cameras.This camera is very small.  It can fit into your front pocket very easy.

I photograph documents a lot, so I am very concerned with the amount of detail that can be captured, especially in relatively low-light conditions. The quality of the pictures is significantly better than any other camera I have tried.PROS:-Produces consistently clear pictures-Extremely compact, lightweight, and sturdy-Easy to use (functions are intuitively organized)-Uses standard USB cable instead of a proprietary one (SONY)-Uses standard memory instead of a proprietary one (SONY)-No wheels or toggle switches jutting out to get caught on things and mess up the settings (when I wanted to take regular pictures, I always seemed to be shooting movies, or photographing in a strange light setting with my SONY camera)CONS:-Buttons seem a little less solid than previous CANON models (my CANON IXY from about 8 years ago was designed a lot better)-Buttons are flush with the body of the camera, so I have to operate it using my fingernails sometimes (again, the buttons on my CANON IXY were much easier to use)-The door to the digital port for connecting the USB cable doesn't swing out very wide, and I have a feeling that if I am not careful it may not last long (the CANON IXY had a soft rubber cover that was much more flexible)In short, this is a great product, but I hope that CANON will re-introduce some of their older design features in the new cameras in order to make them a little sturdier and easier to use. I have not noticed any problems with dead pixels--the LCD screen is beautiful. Please note that you will need to buy a memory card separately. It does not come with one.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for the size/price, but 14 megapixels way misleading", "Author": "Jason Timmes", "ReviewID": "R3GDLKF4RT9M1Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife to replace a 5 year old Sony DSC-T7 (5 megapixel point and shoot).The Canon has FAR superior low light performance, image stabilization works well, great compact size, nice big LCD relative to the size of the camera, and easy intuitive controls (although tiny buttons, if you have big fingers, they're a touch too small in my opinion).To compare, I took similar shots with both cameras, one outside in full sun, the other inside in low light with the flash on.  I left both cameras in full auto mode.  On both shots, the Canon outperforms the older camera (with 5 years of improved technology, I expected nothing less).  The low light flash shot was dramatically better on the Canon (and taking a low light shot without the flash was even more extreme).The outdoor shot, although the Canon was better, it wasn't a whole lot better.  To be honest, for 14 megapixels I was expecting a little more fine detail/sharpness in the image.  Shame on me for thinking a higher resolution sensor would really make that much difference -- when examining fine details, it's really all about optics, and no point and shoot lens is going to measure up to my expectations (I used to do a lot of SLR photography with pro level lenses).So don't expect anything remotely resembling SLR quality results; remember you're buying a point and shoot.  You won't be making any 11x17 prints to proudly hang on the wall.  But the portability of this camera is fantastic; you can easily drop it in a pocket and have it ready when the moment strikes, and the results will look great in a scrapbook or family photo album.

Out of the box, the pics are a bit weak.  Mostly lack of detail.  This is because the camera usually defaults to a very high ISO.  Higher than necessary it seems.The 1400 now has a THIRD switch between Auto Picture and Movie mode.  The Program (manual) mode.This is where the detail comes back into your pictures!Set the ISO to between 80 and 200 and you'll see all the wonderful detail of your subjects!It's too bad the auto mode defaults to such a grainy picture, but it can be overcome with a simple switch.Unfortunately there is no way around this in video mode, so the 720P video is a bit on the grainy side.Still, 14MP for under $150 and in such a compact size, this is a great camera!", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera for the Size, Improvement over Previous Models", "Author": "Kevin K. Fosler", "ReviewID": "R1ZWIHQGPRGWMV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had many Canon Elph cameras since they first came out.  Something that I noticed is that when new features are released for a camera, Canon doesn't get it right the first time and sometimes the 2nd or 3rd versions of a similar camera are better.In this case, I am talking about the current small form factor.  I had the previous version of this camera (SD 940IS) and this one is definitely an improvement.  On the 940, the HD video was very jumpy.  This version fixes that and it's much more smooth.The increase in MP to 14.1 really doesn't improve things.  It's more of a marketing point that camera makers shoot for because people like to see a higher MP.Another review mentioned blurry pictures.  For some reason these small Canons seem to have that problem.  I find it most when I don't use a flash indoors.  I don't think the camera compensates correctly when a person chooses to have the flash turned off.The main thing that I like about this camera is its size.  It's so small, that I can have it with me wherever I go.  I recommend one of the Canon leather belt cases for someone who would want to carry this on a belt.  When I use that with this camera, I hardly notice that it's there.  It is true that the best camera is the one that you have with you, and with the SD1400, this is a camera you can always have with you.I also have a Pansonic ZS3 camera.  It takes better pictures, but it's larger and therefore I don't carry it around.I will update this review with more details when time allows.

I did have problems opening the AV cable cover because it would not fully open.  I am not sure if it was just my camera, or a design flaw, but it was a noticeable problem.  The camera is about the size of a cell phone and it has a 4X optical zoom.

I've never had a camera that could focus on a subject anywhere near that close to the lens! However, we could not afford the 230 price tag, so we were going to settle on the model that is just beneath this one. It is the Canon Powershot A3100 (cheaper by quite a bit, and superior to others in it's own  price range) - That model ALSO focused and photographed just as well when we used the close-up finger test! The photo resolution is just higher on this one, and this one is a 14MP, while the other one is a 12MP. Both have the 4x zoom. I don't remember what the other differences were.Then I saw Amazon's sale price on this one, and was so excited, I snapped it up! My daughter is THRILLED!A cool feature on this camera that I personally haven't seen before... Something they call \"Smart Shutter\". The camera can react to motion in these two ways:1.) For group shots- You can set it to take up to 10 rapid fire pics when someone in the group smiles. The idea is that you have a better chance of getting a good shot that way.2.) Instead of the self-timer option, where you push the button and then try to run and jump into the shot before the shutter snaps the pic--- you can get in the shot- prepare- and wink when you are ready to the pic to be taken. The camera snaps the shot when you wink. No lie. Pretty incredible.Unfortunately, we did not yet know about those 2 features when we were looking at it in the store, so we didn't try those out. I can't tell you if they work as well as promised.We tested the camera zoom to see how clear a pic would come out if we zoomed in on something all the way across the store. Every other camera we tried (in the 120-200 price range) failed this test pretty miserably, as the pics came out dark, or blurred, and often BOTH. THIS camera took a crisp, bright pic in this situation! On top of that, the colors were spot on, if what we saw on the display screen represents what we will actually see in the finished product (obviously we haven't processed a pic onto our computer form the camera yet). While we're on the topic of the display screen-- very nice resolution and nice big, bright screen. Don't know how it will look outside in bright sunlight, but it was bright enough, that I felt it would be fairly easy to see in that situation.We also tested all the cameras in the 120-200 price range to see if they could take a clear pic while we shook the camera. The image stabilization on this one was really good! MUCH better than the others! (The A3100 did pretty well here too)Unlike other Canon digital cameras I've looked at in the past - and ones that belong to friends that I've used -- the interface of this camera (how the buttons work, etc) is pretty intuitive! I was easily able to figure out how to get where I wanted on it, and so was my daughter.It's also very cute. TINY!! Much smaller and thinner than you'd imagine from looking at it online. You can easily carry it comfortably in your pocket. It's a little smaller than my smart phone.I don't know how it stacks up to other 230.00 cameras- I'm just telling you it is an INCREDIBLE deal at this sale price (149)! Seriously!! -- GRAB IT!PS - if you try to order this at the store website I was looking at earlier (Tar**t) - they will charge you 14.00 more by the time they add shipping and tax. Not so here at Amazon!UPDATE: Have camera now and have been learning to use it. Have posted some pics we took of snow where you can actually see individual snowflakes in full detail. Amazing! Especially considering we didn't even use the macro feature to get those. Just pointed and shot. Very important to use the shutter button correctly to get sharp focus - hold button down HALFWAY until camera beeps, then press all the way to get shot. Does make a difference.I accidentally dropped this camera today onto a hardwood floor from about 4 feet up. Still works.

Bowdish", "ReviewID": "R1QUYL5DBUYZMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Living in a household with a several of these Canon point-and-shoot cameras (among them the SD1100IS, SD1200IS, and the SD780IS), I purchased this camera as a convenient upgrade to a 3.2 megapixel behemoth I owned from earlier in the decade. So far, I am incredibly impressed at the feature set this camera has to offer.In lieu of verbosity, I tend to like outlining the high and low points in a list:PROS:+Ultra-sleek and lightweight (this camera is so handy to slip into a pocket, you'll find yourself taking more photos straight away).+Large, crisp LCD screen (of all the cameras I tried, this one seemed to have one of the better displays, and they finally removed the cheesy little viewfinder in place of the larger screen).+Good photo quality (about on par with other digital cameras of this class)+Very easy to use (in addition to the many shooting modes for every occasion [fireworks, kids & pets, portrait etc...], this camera provides little on-screen hints and helpful descriptions of all the features as you go through them)CONS:-A bit slow (the lag between shots and during focusing is sometimes a bit long)-Tiny buttons (people like me who don't have such nimble fingers will quite likely hit multiple buttons at a time)-A bit unstable (this camera, being so thin, does not stand on a table very well; it'll fall right over)Now just in general about a couple of the characteristics people would like to know about:BATTERY LIFE: I always recommend carrying a spare battery along with you for long trips and such, but the included 760 mAh Li-Ion battery is pretty decent. For most casual shooting, expect the battery to last comfortably for a day trip or to a few family gatherings before needing a recharge. Charging the battery is really snappy with the included wall charger (I would guess about an hour).IMAGE QUALITY: For the kind of camera this is (ultracompact point and shoot), I found the image quality to be very good, pretty much on par with most of these kinds of cameras. As always, with a tiny camera like this, you'll see a bit of distortion with the wide-angle lens, and color fringing can be noticed in some cases. Nonetheless, for printing, e-mailing, and general sharing, this camera more than meets the grade with sharp, saturated images.No camera is perfect (and so if I could, I'd probably give this one 4.5 stars), but this one is sure to not disappoint with its wealth of easy-to-use features, and clean, vibrant imagery. If there is anything to consider before purchasing this camera, it is whether or not its small form factor would be more burdening than helpful.

In this respect, unfortunately, the 1400 sucks.Unlike their cameras of the past, the 1400 seems to use the entire frame to determine how to autofocus.  So if you're taking a macro pic of something that fills the entire frame, you're golden.  But try to take a macro pic of something that DOESN'T fill the entire frame, you're screwed.It makes no difference whether you set the \"AF Frame Size\" to \"Small.\"  It ignores the rectangle that's on the screen, and still uses the entire frame.I bought this cam as a replacement for the 790, which in macro mode, always autofocused on what was in the center of the screen, no matter how small.

This SD1400 didn't have as many reviews but I went with it and it blew me away! I had no idea that such a tiny little device smaller than my Blackberry could produce such wonderful images! I am very pleased with the smart auto, and even the other little features it has that I originally thought I'd never use, but actually are very fun and produce very nice results! It is very easy to use, and all the features and settings are very self explanatory.

I had at first thought the pictures weren't very sharp, but doing outdoor shooting on an overcast day I probably should have set the ISO speed higher for faster shutter speeds and maybe not rely on the auto setting. The one drawback is you have no control over F-stops. I do small product photography and and seemingly stuck with very wide open F-stops usually at 2.8 which blurs everything out except exactly the flat plane you're focused on, not too great for objects with some depth to them. Maybe someone can tell me how to trick the camera into using a smaller aperture, but so far haven't figured out how and I am using a tripod and the selftimer for best sharpness. I really wish it had aperture priority shooting for my product shots. I compared shots from this camera to my  girlfriend's old Powershot G6 at7.1 pixels and the 1400's images are much more detailed and sharper. I shot two movies of our dogs in somewhat low indoor light and there was some ragged looking pixelation in darker image areas I didn't like but I didn't buy this thing to shoot movies either. I have an old Nikon Coolpix 3.3 megapixel camera that isn't very wide angle that will beat this thing for sharp product photos using aperture priority set at F11 or so, so am spoiled by that. I do have some background in photography so I have gone through almost every feature in this little jewel and have changed my mind about returning it. It does take some figuring out though. If you forget to turn off the red eye feature it will shine a red light at everything you photograph and even put the red beam in the photo if you have the flash turned off, took awhile to figure that out. It also uses the red beam briefly to help auto focus so was confused by what was happening, the red eye beam is in the flash settings and the auto focus assist which uses the same red beam is in the auto focus settings. Fortunately the settings and menus have text explanations that show what each feature is for. There are an awful lot of great features to use in the program mode if you have the patience to go through them and play around with each one.

We've had Canon Powershot SD models for our past 3-5 cameras, basically since our first digital camera.  The last one we had was amazing, and lasted for several years before the lens mechanism popped out when my wife dropped it on the floor.  It still mostly worked, incredibly, but we decided it was time for a new camera.I basically bought this camera, then started reading reviews after it was shipped.  BIG mistake.  If you can still return this camera, do it.We immediately started noticing all of the issues the reviewers here talk about.  The frequently-off auto focus that results in blurry pictures - even when taking a picture of someone standing still 4 feet in front of you.  The long delay that ensures you miss whatever you were trying to capture - for instance my 1 year old son has always turned away from the camera by the time the shutter clicks.  The flash is neurotic - firing in bright conditions, not firing in pitch black conditions, and the camera even lacks the \"always use flash\" option that would prevent it from mis-guessing.  (The option exists in manual mode, but who gets a point and shoot to use manual settings?)Not only has this camera been a stark disappointment compared to every other Powershot SD model we've owned, but it has already died on us, about a year after we bought it.  The lens just stopped opening properly, quite suddenly.  I had a previous Powershot that my dad actually dropped on the sand at the beach, but even then I blew out the sand and it kept working for another year, with minor hitching of the lens motor.  This camera was working (poorly as usual) one night, I had it in my pocket, took it inside, set it on the counter, and the next day the lens mechanism no longer opens.We still like the SD line enough that we're going to try an \"older\" SD940IS next, since the reviews are much more positive on that model.

That's not to say that they are wrong in their reviews, just that you need to take the review in context.We buy mid-priced ($200 - $400) digital cameras about twice a year, and have several (more than 4) Canon PowerShots. So, we know what is on the market now, and what to expect from a Canon Powershot in this price range.We selected this one because it was a recent model (less than 1 yr old), had the features we wanted, the color was fun, the price was reasonable and the ratings were decent (120 ratings averaging at 4 stars). We are returning it because it sucks.It's possible we just got a bad camera that slipped through QA (Quality Assurance), and it's also possible that this particular model is very poorly designed and made and you are likely to have the same bad experience.The focusing mechanism is horrible compared to other Canon Powershot released in the last 24 months. You will have more out of focus photos than you expect or than you should get.The flash sensor is also very poorly done and you will have several dark photos, even when you get your scene selection right for the particular conditions.We are returning this camera, and we will give Canon one more chance by ordering a different model, although in general we find that their lens retracing mechanism is substandard and breaks far too easily (search for \"lens error canon\" and you'll see how many folks complain of this), rendering the entire camera useless.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Small and Easy to use camera!!", "Author": "Flip_francis1203", "ReviewID": "RQ1B80POZUEWR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a perfect small camera that is easy and fun to use but also takes wonderful images and videos.

We had the SD550 for about four years before we dropped it on the floor and it stopped working. The SD1400 provides what the SD550 had and more and its size is very ideal for saving space. The images are very clear, crisp, and vivid. There are few issues with the new SD1400 that is a big change from our the previous Canon we had.1) The SD1400 camera body looks a bit cheaper than the previous SD550 and seems to have flimsy components (such as the door for the battery and card compartment).2) The camera suffers from the lagged response, especially for taking shots in succession. It seems it is too long to focus and process images. I do understand that point-n-shoot can't be compared to DSLRs but this camera exhibits this issue more prominently. It should be ok if you plan to take pictures during daylight and especially outside or if you don't have kids that you are chasing for a good picture with flash photography.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera but there's a much better value to be had.", "Author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\"", "ReviewID": "R2ELI57EVW6QU0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The better value may be the Canon PowerShot SD1300IS 12 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Brown).  The two significant differences between that camera and this one is 12MP vs 14MP and $130 vs $180.  Unless you plan on blowing up a picture to way more than poster size the difference in sensor pixel count will make absolutely not noticeable difference.  You also get HD movies (at 720p) with this camera but you're limited to how long they can be due to battery life and sensor heating.So, if really big enlargements or not very long HD movies are important then you will not go wrong with this camera.  However, if you can live without those items and want to pocket $50 then consider the SD1300IS.What follows is my review for the SD1300IS and everything I said there pertains to this camera as well.  I hope you find it, as well as this comparison, helpful.The title of that review is:The best camera to have......is one you'll have with you.  The nice thing about the Canon ELPH series is they easily fit into your pocket, are well built/designed, don't cost a lot, come with a boatload of features, and take great pictures.  The SD1300, the latest in the ELPH line continues in that tradition, adding considerable additional sophistication and sacrificing some useful functionality in the interest of cutting cost.It is a small camera and carries with it the baggage that comes with the convenience of having to carry so little baggage.  (sorry, couldn't resist) None of the issues raised, given that they comes as part of the convenience trade-off made me consider anything other than the 5-star rating this camera deserves.-  Many of the functions are only accessible through menus, sometimes several levels deep.  The good new is the Automatic and scene modes are pretty good (as long as you spend a few minutes reviewing what they really do).  This camera is not intended to be used in aperture or shutter priority, let alone full manual.-  The battery life might be shorter than you expect.  That's a trade-off for having a camera that's small and light;  you get a battery that is small and light.  One thing you can do is get a spare battery.  That is good advice for any camera. Another thing that will help is to keep the display off as much as possible.  That means using the monitor as little as possible.  The \"sad\" part is that Canon chose to drop the optical viewfinder in this model.  That means a camera that is simpler and less expensive to make but will go through batteries quicker because you must use the display when taking picture.-  The camera response is a bit slow for effectively capturing children and pets.  The trick for doing that is to either have a great sense of timing and a shutter that reacts instantly or a reasonably fast ( > 4x / sec ) burst mode.  This camera has neither.Some other suggestions that apply:-  Use the lowest ISO available given your requirement for either aperture or shutter speed. To avoid getting technical, higher ISO always introduces higher noise. At issue is when it becomes noticeable. In newer dSLR cameras you can get over 1000, maybe well over depending on the camera, before the noise becomes noticeable. For this camera keeping it at or below 200 is a good idea.-  Don't use in-camera sharpening. Digital pictures will almost always benefit from sharpening but you are better off doing it with a photo editing program.  Computer-based algorithms tend to be more sophisticated and you can better judge the results on your monitor as opposed to the camera LCD.-  If you want more vivid colors and have the choice use sRGB instead of Adobe RGB. While you get fewer colors they are distributed over a wider range. They are also render better on computer monitors, many commercial labs, and any other place your pictures are likely to show up.Finally, I've found the Caselogic QPB-1 Compact Digital Camera Case (Black/Gray) is just the right size for this camera.  It's semi-rigid so you get a fair amount of protection but doesn't add a lot of bulk.  It's made even better by using one of these, Nite Ize SB1-2PK-01 Size-1 S-Biner, Black, 2-Pack, to secure it to a belt loop.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very slow to take pictures", "Author": "Sue Hardman \"Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R158DJIMUKIKLI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Have had the camera only a couple months and just recently used it for candid wedding shots.

I had a number of these over the years, SD600, SD700, etc, buying new ones as the older ones were passed down. The most recent I had was the SD1000, which I loved. Try buying one of those right now even though it is an old model! It will cost you at least twice the price of this \"latest and greatest\" model. When a family member needed a camera, I foolishly gave away my SD1000, thinking I would just move up to the latest version, the SD1400IS. What a terrible mistake. It is a 14 MP camera and the compared to the 7 MP SD1000, it is terrible, absolutely terrible as far as picture quality. With the SD1000, practically every shot is a winner, close-ups, long shots, indoors, outdoors, you name it. With this junk, I have to make sure to take at least 2 of everything, and preferably more, and even then I still get a lot of throwaways which are garbage - out of focus, terrible pictures. The technical reasons why have been well-documented in other posts here at Amazon so I won't repeat it all here, I am just here to add another voice and confirm it.On top of that, this camera feels like a piece of junk compared to the SD1000. And the door assembly to access the battery and SD card? It is an absolute joke. It must be a joke. No one who is a serious product designer or a serious engineer could possibly come up with such a completely useless and inferior design. The rubber part will be sure to fall off before long, and from that point it is pretty much impossible to get stuck back on so it will stay. You would have to look at something like this and think that the company responsible must be a pack of incompetent idiots to send something like that to their customers. You mean to tell me that no one at Canon actually takes a LOOK at that piece, and tries it out? Absolutely pathetic.I really wish I hadn't wasted my money on this junk. And worse, a while back, based on my previous good experiences with Canon, I bought my first DSLR from them, which was a fairly expensive investment, over $1,000 with lenses. Now I regret that decision. So far that camera has been great and it hasn't had any issues so maybe I will be lucky.

It DOES take great quality pictures-- eventually. The shutter lag is totally unacceptable, and SO five years ago. We're talking 750-1,500 milliseconds.  I was trying to take pix of a new Christmas pup, and got mostly empty frames because by the time the shutter clicked the pup was long gone. I tried several different shooting modes, and none seemed to make any difference. The only thing the \"Pets and Kids\" setting does is remove choices from the menus.It is also too slippery and hard to hold. The SD1000 had edges you could grip, this thing is like holding a slippery bar of soap. Horrible design. It won't stand up by itself so you can't set it on its bottom of side to take a self-timer pic either. it has no flat surfaces. My fault, it wasn't something I could try before I bought, since the only place it looked at it in a brick and mortar had it tethered to a huge anti-theft device. It seems to take an interminable amount of time to focus and then determine the exposure. Even after I get a focus lock beep it pauses before the shutter. People get tired of smiling waiting for the shutter. Really terrible.  Flash recycle/recharge times are LOOONG too. Yes, the battery was fully charged! I've got a Class 10 SD card in the camera and it still takes 4 seconds to store a 5Mpix image.  Canon cheaped-out and removed the sliding cinch on the wrist strap so you can't tighten it against your wrist to secure the loop. It may not seem important to some, but I use my cameras while climbing and dangling over cliffs, and this way just doesn't feel secure.Manual exposure controls are nicely accessible, instead of having to dig through the menus like the old one, but the navigation disc is too recessed and hard to use without using fingernails. Finger tips just don't work. I don't have big fingers, but this thing is really difficult to use. Zoom is really jerky, and difficult to stop where you want. The camera seems to ignore input, and then overshoots what you want to frame.

I wanted something small and compact that I could easily access and take quick photos when I didn't want to lug around my slr.  I figured Canon would be a great choice since I LOVE my canon dslr and have seen photos taken with older models of the digital elph that have good quality for a p&s.;  Let me say, all older elph models slap all over the the sd1400.  At first I thought it was user error and I just needed to get used to using it, although this somewhat puzzled me because point and shoots are made to be just that.  Point and shoot.  This camera is so inconsistent.  It doesn't always focus, acutally more often than not I would say that I lose a shot due to focus errors.  It is terrible in low light even with the flash on.  Forget about using Auto.  I wanted something that I could keep on auto for when I was out at night with friends and this camera does not do the job.  Half the time on auto, rather than use the flash the camera decides that the minimal light in the room is sufficent enough and no flash will go off, resulting in a dark grainy photo.  Sometimes the entire shot will turn up blurry as if takeen with a toy or disposable camera.  Often times in lighted situations the skin color of subjects will be a very unnatural orange color.  Though I do like the different settings such as fish eye and tilt shift if you are in a low light situtaion you must reselect the flash each shot.  It will not remember and keep the flash on while using that particular setting.  This is time consuming and frustrating when you would like to take several photos in a short period and must remember to reset the flash on button each time.  I often forget this and have to retake photos.  At first I thought that this issue could be resolved by changing settings on the camera but when I set flash to on, the very next shot goes back to no flash...?

I had just purchased our second one for myself and I purchased this one for my wife to replace her broken Powershot.

It is easy to use, and once you can navigate the menus (takes a few uses to figure this part out) the features are many.

The combo was great! I always just slipped the SD1400 in my pocket, whether we felt like carrying the megazoom along or not.  The SD1400 is so small, but what's great is that nothing suffers because of the size. The screen is plenty big, and I have large hands, but easily used the navigation buttons as well as the zoom switch (which before I bought I was skeptical about). I really like the navigation and how quickly I can change between settings and between picture and HD video, love the HD video. My canon cameras have always taken incredible outdoor shots and this camera is no exception. But what is exceptional is how it takes portrait shots outside with a dark foreground subject and a sunlit background; somehow it manages to lighten the foreground figure without sacrificing what is behind, really lovely outcomes. Also there is the \"low light\" setting that I've never had on another camera; it's great for inside restaurants and dim cathedral interiors without using flash! Autofocus is great. Continuous shooting is great. And liked the fun added settings of Miniature Effect and Fisheye Effect. Really the only thing that bothers me is the cheesy rubber piece that covers the HDMI and usb, other than that the camera is solid, sleek and feels like quality. The one feature missing for me is that I'd love to have stereo sound with my 720p HD video, but I guess you can only fit so much in a small beautiful finished package.Canon PowerShot SD1400IS 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera with many options", "Author": "Master Jedi", "ReviewID": "R2PAO3P3XR0YIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I purchased this camera after seeing at a well-known retailer, even though we were looking at another model (we were always in search of a Canon to replace our other one that had become out-dated).We both like it's heavily-laden options, wide-angle lens, larger LCD display (2.7\"), and HD video-recording capabilities.  Despite its petite size (it's about the size of a credit card, save for its thickness), neither of us have had any problems pressing the smaller-than average buttons.  I genuinely thought that this would be a hindrance, but was pleasantly rewarded with an ironic experience: they are easy to press without erroneously selecting another option on the menu.Speaking of the menu...there are MANY options on this camera, but all quite easily manipulated.  Some, who are not familiar with Canon cameras, or their menu options, might have to be somewhat patient in learning what options are available.  Otherwise, there is plenty to chose from.Our only \"complaint\" (the quotes make them minor ones) is in reference to the wrist strap (of all things).  Our previous Canon camera came with one with an adjustable strap, while our new one does not.

Most of my pictures are blurred. The inside pictures look yellow. I held the camera really still, pressed the shutter button 1/2 way, and breathed out before taking the pic. Almost all of them still turned out horrible. It is lightweight and cheap, but cheap is the quality you are going to get with your pictures too.

I have the black model. It's sleek and stylish.I also have a Canon S5 with lens and filters attachments, and gives me near-DSLR control over camera settings. But it is somewhat bulky, and therefore doesn't come with me most of the time.The SD1400 is super-tiny. Fits in any pocket. It feels great in the hand. The rounded edges are a big improvement over past models that were somewhat boxy and sharp even thought they were small. The SD1400 is the slimmest Canon ever. The photo quality is impressive. Not as good as bulkier cameras with larger CCD chips, but if you are looking to get 4x6, 5x7, or 8x10 prints, or if you like to look at your photos on your HD TV or computer screen, this camera totally satisfies. I shoot everything at 9 mega-pixels, not at the 14 mega-pixel highest setting.The Digic IV firmware is excellent. I love the auto-focus, image stabilization and face recognition. It keeps improving over previous Digic generations. There are many other features that can be quite useful, like blink recognition, and some I will rarely use. Fish-eye effect is fun, as is color swap. But you can also do these in post production. You have some control over settings, but Auto mode works so well, why monkey around? Get your shots and get back to enjoying what you are doing. This is the kind of camera you use to quickly document events in your life while barely being noticed. It's not for professional use. If you think of it that way, you will be very satisfied. Wide aperture range, good 4x zoom, and decent low light performance. Compares favorably with any small compact camera you can find today.The HD video quality is excellent. 720P is perfect for my needs. While 1080P is not supported, my dual-core PC handles 720P much better during editing. And it looks great on an HDTV TV using a mini-HDMI-to-HDMI cable from Amazon. I wish am HDMI cable came with the camera, but cables are inexpensive online. I also wish you could use optical zoom while shooting video.The SD1400 replaces my outstanding Canon SD870 8 mega-pixel camera, which three times had the dubious \"lens error.\" This happened when it was in my pocket and the on/off button was accidentally pushed. The lens would partially extend and become knocked out of alignment. Two of the repairs were under warranty (Amex extended my warranty an additional year). The last error was 3 years into the camera's life. Fortunately, Canon has addressed the \"lens error\" problem. In the SD1400, if the lens is prevented from fully extending at startup, it displays a message, automatically retracts the lens, and the camera turns off. This is the much-needed fix to a long-time problem with Canon Powershot compacts. You can try it at a local electronics store. It really works!Bottom line... Put the SD1400 in Auto mode and snap away. You will not be disappointed. It's the best, tiniest, sleekest, coolest compact camera in the market (until Canon raises the bar in another couple years).", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "SD1400 -- Great cameral!!", "Author": "Jennifer Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2QXX5VYWW68RS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this from Amazon in early April and it arrived a lot sooner than it said on the website (it took maybe 4 days).

I have had this for a while now; several months. This camera, as some others have noted, just takes flat out poor pictures. I had a cheaper Sony P&S; that was much older than this, and it had absolutely superior low ISO performance, and was faster too. Getting photos that are not blurry with this camera is very difficult; even in ideal conditions such as bright daylight, images are soft and bland feeling. The color fidelity is poor as well, again, the vibrancy is not as good as my old Sony.After thinking I was just doing something wrong for a while, blaming human error rather than the tool- I can honestly say this is just a plain mediocre camera. It is slim and appealing for a pocket camera, but who cares; most of the pictures you will take with this are going to be a disappointment, and you too will likely wind up getting something to replace it. In fact, this pushed me over the edge to move away from point and shoots altogether, and I got a Canon T3 (I have nothing against Canon, just the 1400IS...) and obviously that is superior, although it's not fair to compare this to a DSLR.The bottom line though, even compared to most point and shoots, this camera does not stack up. Compare images produced by this camera to others, and the clarity, color, and image noise on this will lose out most of the time. I do not know what went wrong, but Canon dropped the ball with this one- cheap image sensor, poor JPEG compression engine, bad lens?

The wink works great, just set up the camera, step in where ever you'd like and then take a slow deliberate wink and the camera shutter activates seconds later.  The take photo when a new face enters works just as well and exactly like the name implies.

opportunities. The camera takes extremely clear photos when outside with bright light. However when indoors with low light, this camera is not that great. And if you plan to use the zoom and take photos or video at a distance don't expect the beautiful sharp quality as that of the non-zoomed photos. The digital zoom is horrible. So horrible that I have turned off the feature so that we can't possibly even use zoom. Overall, the camera will do what we wanted it for and we won't miss the candid shots of our 2 year old.

The reviewer said the flap is flimsy, could easily break. But I thought, hey, it's a Canon, surely it can't be that bad.Unfortunately, it is that bad. Within two weeks of my camera purchase and usage, the flap broke. And the breakage causes a real headache in using the camera.Here's the deal: The camera has a serious design/manufacturing flaw with the door to its battery/memory chip compartment. To open the compartment, you must lift the rubber flap, slide a hard plastic door to the side, and pop open the door. However, the rubber flap is flimsy and it broke right away. That means a hole in the plastic door is no longer covered by the flap, and dust and dirt can enter that hole and damage the battery and memory chip. (Why the hole is put in the plastic door, I don't know. Another design flaw?)Anyway, right now I have scotch tape over the hole and have contacted the seller for a return of the camera. It's very disappointing that Canon would produce an otherwise fine camera with such a lousy design of the door. In effect, it's putting a one-cent piece-of-junk flap on an otherwise good camera; the whole camera is down the toilet because of that single little production cheat.Who'd have expected that of Canon? Not me. But I will from now on.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed Canon fan", "Author": "A.

Difficulties in focusing at night.", "Author": "supertsik \"supertsik\"", "ReviewID": "R1TG6ZE267D7OF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I owned several previous PowerShot models and I loved them all. I have tried lots of other makes too and until now Canon always ranked top in the quality of pictures. However, the SD1400 has difficulties in processing the pictures.Comments:1) AUTO mode is useless. It only works under ideal conditions. Canon tried to improve it by increasing the number of factors it calculates, but this defeated the purpose. Many times, especially at night, it sets the focusing range in \"Macro\" mode and my pictures get blurry. Generally, I get lots of blurry images, lots of overexposed images and noise. This wasn't the case with similar previous models that their AUTO mode was less complex.2) Similarly, other modes with semi-auto functions result in blurry and noisy images too. To overcome this, I only use it at \"P\" mode where I set ISO to 100 (or sometimes more), focusing range to 'infinity' and I select whether to use flash or not. Also, almost every time I use a different focusing/lighting point (by pressing the shutter button half-way) in order to achieve better lighting and not \"burn\" the picture.3) Very nice HD 720p video. However: A. Difficulty focusing at night too, B. Very large files mainly due to uncompressed audio.4) Nice lens, nice screen, fast browsing and very compact. However: Due to its round shape, it is very difficult to balance it on a surface in order to use timer.5) Nice features like 'color accent' and 'long shutter' (15 sec). Also excellent pictures under ideal lighting conditions.My general comment is that with previous Canon models, most of the times I would be satisfied with the picture. With this one, almost every other time I have to retake the picture. Therefore, I would not recommend this camera. I am selling mine and I will buy a different make, at least until Canon improves its compact range.Advice to those who know nothing about cameras:Don't be fooled by Megapixels and other numbers under the camera specifications. It is how well all the features of the camera work together to achieve the best result that matters. If you need proof, take a picture with a mobile phone and then set a compact camera at the same megapixels as your phone and compare the images. You will see a huge difference. Therefore, just read the reviews and buy the camera that has the largest percentage of users satisfied with its pictures.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Google 'canon 1400 lens error'", "Author": "Dennis \"DTz\"", "ReviewID": "R1TJ47BIYKE436", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera is certainly compact and produces some impressive images given good lighting and no movement.

The picture quality is decent and it is certainly small enough.  However, when I went to charge the battery, the rubber cover that seals the battery and flash card compartment from external elements became detached.  There are small holes in the plate that are protected by this rubber piece - this is what protects the battery and flash card.  I thought this wasn't a huge issue, I would just reattach the rubber - it is fitted with little rubber dimples.  Imaage the surprise when after 15 minutes of trying to reattach...  The seal was broken and getting a nice flush surface was no longer possible.  I could attach one end or another, but not flush for the length of the seal.This brings me to my question of why in the world would Canon build a protective cover that should never get removed from the case and then make it removable?  Why would Canon not just permabond this rubber to the hinge?  The purpose of this rubber appears to provide a non-slip surface to allow this compartment to be opened - it doesn't have to be removable.  It seems that it would be far cheaper to manufacture without all the precision of dipples, fitting, etc...At this point I grabbed a bottle of super glue and fixed it - which works - but since it isn't flush, it really looks quite poor.  However, without this cover, any sort of dirt/debris would enter the camera and potentially damage it - so I see this super glue approach as the lesser of two evils.

I am very picky and had been doing camera research for quite some time before I found this online and made the purchase. It's been a month now, and this is what I have concluded so far.I love how it can fit in my pocket and go with me ANY where without taking up much space. Before buying this, my biggest concern was owning a large camera that was too bulky. This camera is what some might say \"too small\" but for me, it is perfect. Very thin width, and easy to tuck into your pocket or purse for on-the-go moments. One great feature is the ability to change the type of photography setting; I have loved using the Kids/Pets function to take pictures of moving objects because it can easily capture a still shot of a moment that would have otherwise been blurry. I recently went to my cousins wedding and got a great snapshot of my parents dancing, and it came out fabulous. The battery life is great, but definitely won't last as long when you take videos. It can also get annoying to see the \"Busy\" signal after taking a photo, but that doesn't stay on the screen for very long.The two main things I definitely do NOT like: the bottom of the camera is not very flat, so it is hard to set the camera down on a surface and have it balance if you want to set up the 10 second timer. Also, the plastic piece that covers the spot to plug in the camera cord does not open well for me. I'm not sure if this is common on all of this version of the camera or if my particular camera has this malfunction. However, every time I open mine, I feel as though the plastic covering piece might snap off. I have started removing my SD card and putting it directly into an SD slot that is on the side of my computer to load my pictures (without ever having to open the camera cord compartment) so it doesn't bother me anymore. Besides these few minor details, it is WONDERFUL, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a compact camera that takes amazing pictures!

Low light ones were the worst, but overall, the slowness of this camera, in terms of focusing and FINALLY taking a picture, is what has driven me to get rid of it (countless shots were missed and the others tended to often be bad).Yes, I have a S95 and it ROCKS.  It costs $400 but consistently takes amazing pictures (as opposed to the 1400 consistently taking BAD pictures).

If your hands aren't that big this won't be a problem, but if you have big hands make sure to go to a store and try it out first.2. In low light situations the camera tends to either up the ISO level too high and leave the shutter open too long, leading to fuzzy or blurry pictures OR the flash goes off and it overexposes the picture slightly.Overall though, for a small relatively cheap camera, this does a good job.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Compact Camera", "Author": "Syracuse Pete", "ReviewID": "R2Y1FXVQS4N0TI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No Complaints at all.

The SD1000 was a nice piece of stainless steel - the newer model seems flimsy by comparison. Smaller, yes - better quality, no. The images at 14MP are actually worse than the previous camera (not unexpected since the sensor size didn't change) but should have been of equal quality. The metering is also worse, producing many shots that are either under or over exposed. The IS on the camera really makes little difference in overall image quality. I would really not recommend this camera to anyone - there are much better small cameras on the market.

Next, the controls are arranged in the clumsiest possible way.  If you want to see a focused picture, you must push the shutter button down half-way, but to operate the zoom you must take your finger off the shutter button and move the zoom slide, which is very sticky and you end jerking the camara around and off-picture.  In other words, you can zoom a blurry picture or you can see a good picture wherever the zoom happens to be set.  On other cameras you can do both at the same time.  Finally, the camera is just too small for adult (at least male) hands.  It is, in its own way, a marvel of miniaturization, but unless you have miniature hands you are out of luck.Secondly, there is a problem with the Amazon return policy, which is stated as 30 days for cameras.  However, even if you buy it from Amazon and pay your money to Amazon, if they ship it from one of their associates (say 17th Street Photo) you are stuck with the return policy of that associate, which happens to be 7 days.  After giving it a couple of tries over 10-12 days, I tried returning it to Amazon, who forwarded me to 17th Street Photo, who told me I was past the return date.  I complained to Amazon who told me I actually bought it from 17th Street Photo, that they had nothing to do with the sale, and while they would think about it, I was basically stuck.

I did a lot of research before buying this one, knowing that I did not want to lug my digital SLR with me while touristing around under the sun. So, I was set on a second P&S; anyhow. I bought a 16G SD card, and it worked beatifully. I have not tested the video, yet. But, the pictures are excellent. No, this is not a touch screen camera, and in fact, I am glad that it is not. I don't want to accidentally touch the screen and change something - I'd rather be in control.Pros: Very small size, bunch of options you can pick, or just switch the dial to \"Green\" and let the camera auto-pick the setting for you.  Very light, great LCD screen, auto rotate in the LCD viewer. Its integration with Windows 7 is remarkable - I love it. The battery that comes with it lasted for about 200 images, including some with flashes. It falls short of the claimed 220 (or so), but they always do since they don't assume flash and on/off cycles in-between the shots.Cons: Special battery - but I almost hesitate to put this in as a con. I also ordered a 3-pack battery set for less than $10, and found out that the replacement 3rd party battery has a higher mAh than the one that comes with the camera. Well, that's good, because I hate to run out of battery. Mind you, the fill-in flash for portraits on a sunny day does not always automatically kick in.

They both perform similarly.  The SD1400IS is a really decent point and shoot camera and produces great pictures for scenes where there is not a lot of fast movement and there is adequate light.  I love it for outdoor shots.  When the flash is disabled pictures can be taken about once every two seconds.  It has good adjustments for White Balance.  Typical for point and shoots with this size sensor, it shows some grain compared with a DSLR as the ISO value goes above 80-100 - this isn't a hit against the camera though as pictures are still very good.  Focus is generally good in Auto and Program modes but the camera may decide to focus on something other than what you expect.  Pressing the shutter button half way re-focuses so it just takes a small movement of the camera to put what you want in the green focus box.  Shooting indoors with compact fluorescent lighting often produces pictures with a yellowish hue.  This is typical with many digital cameras but it can be overcome by using the Custom White balance setting.  Video is good at all video resolutions.  Optical Zoom works well with pictures or video.  A word of caution: You can change the zoom level while videoing but only up or back to the level you start with.  If you are partially zoomed in you can increase the zoom level but you can't go below the zoom level you started with.  All in all a great little camera which I can easily recommend.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Okay at First - Disappointing in the End", "Author": "Earl Wilkerson", "ReviewID": "RMWKOK9LFH9EA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I admit when I first purchased the 1400IS, I was immediately excited to have an ultra-portable, lightweight and effective alternative to my beloved - albeit bulky - dSLR.  That opinion changed, however, after the first five or six outings.I own and regularly use a dSLR, and understand the features they offer, so I will preface this review with the notion that a point and shoot can never really replace an SLR, digital or otherwise.  Many of the features present on the \"big boy\" SLR cameras absolutely cannot compare to the simpler-built point-and-shoots.  That's not a slight towards point-and-shoots; it is a fact.I have used my wife's Canon point-and-shoot and love it (an earlier PowerShot model).  The image quality is outstanding, and color accuracy is quite good.  Additional, it features a limited amount of shutter lag, low flash recycle time, and a rather good battery life.Still, I maintain a not-so-warm-and-fuzzy feeling towards the 1400IS.  Although it possesses a decent battery life, and a wealth of handy features (like video mode), I found the image quality is less than optimal, even in the best of lighting scenarios.  A sunny, mid-afternoon photo in \"auto mode\" should not require the camera be stabilized on a tripod to avoid motion blur (due to a very low shutter speed).  Technically, in some cases it shouldn't even necessitate the use of the flash.  Yet the photo is either underexposed or blurry because the sensor built into this camera experiences a dramatic and catastrophic lapse in \"judgment\" when determining the proper balance of shutter speed, aperture, and ISO speed.  As was the case in nearly every environment, I put the camera in.Other than the nagging element of sketchy picture quality, the camera was everything I read about prior to purchasing:  very small/lightweight, had good battery life, bright LCD screen, fast shutter response, excellent range of automatic modes (such as night, sport, etc.), etc.A vast majority of the camera gear I've purchased in the past has carried the Canon badge, but this is the only I've encountered so far that leaves me regretting the purchase.  Perhaps I bought a defective copy?  Perhaps I simply bought a bad camera?  I cannot really decide.

Even though bright out the camera selected a wide open aperture (f2.8) resulting in a very shallow depth of field and secondary subjects being blurry.

I'd previously been using a Minolta DiMage, but some screws had popped out requiring it to be held together with a rubber band.  It was time to get a new one.  What I hadn't realized is that most newer cameras require you to go into an on screen menu to switch from photo to video mode.  I first tried out a Kodak EasyShare thinking that the button with the camera/video picture next to it would just let you switch back and forth by just hitting the button again.  One afternoon of hitting the button, looking at the screen, using small buttons to scroll down one, hitting the select button, and then focusing the camera on what you wanted to photograph/snap a video of was just waaaaay too annoying.  And by the time I'd complete the switch the moment would have passed.  Also every time I turned the camera off to put it in my pocket, I'd have to go through the selection time again when I wanted to take another video.  So I took it back to the store, paid the 15% restocking fee, and then came home with a Canon Powershoot SD1400IS.All I knew about the Canon Powershoot SD1400IS was that 1) it had a manual button to switch between photo and video, and 2) it was on sale (close out).  I hadn't done much research.  I just wanted a camera that would be no hassle for taking pictures and videos of my two kids and for on trips.I couldn't be more pleased and believe that I've found *MY* camera.  It has all of the functions I could wish for in a small point and shoot camera.Pros1)  amazingly small - smaller than my iPod touch2)  intuitive, if necessarily small, switches3)  manual switch goes up and down (not a twist knob) and has three positions:  photo, program, video with the auto photo and video options being at the two extremes, making it easy to switch between the two without looking.4)  microphone on the video seems to have the right level of sensitivity -- not much residual hissing, and yet it seems to pick up voices easily from about 20 feet away (the Kodak EasyShare would only pick up extremely loud noises or those within about 5 feet of the camera).5)  photo quality is fine - decent flash and low and bright light6)  The view screen is surprisingly bright even in bright light7)  Battery charger is small and plugs into the wall flush -- I like this option vs. plugging the camera in and having the battery charge in the camera, since I'm one who likes to have a spare battery charging so that I can swap them out.  And I hate long cords on charging stuff -- they get tangled.8)  The best part is the program switch.  You can set it up to do all sorts of odd things - fish eye, multiple shots by just holding down the button, focusing in on only one color (you focus, say, on a red t-shirt and then any shots you take will show only the red things in color and the rest go to black and white -- you can also do this with your video...), and more.  Once you've programmed it, it'll stay with those settings until you program it to do something else -- even if you've turned off the camera in the meantime.  And you can always just switch it over to auto to take \"normal\" photos and then back to program and take the \"funny\" ones.Cons1) I'd love to have been able to get one in candy-apple green.  I'd have preferred a brighter color to make it easier to find since it is so small and my favorite color is green.  (Hot pink was also available on sale when I bought mine, but I'm just not a fuchsia kind of girl).2)  If you have thick fingers, you will not likely enjoy the size of the camera or its buttons.3)  The A/V out has a stiff cover that doesn't open all the way, so it's awkward plugging in the cord to download your pics", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "it's ok but not amazing.", "Author": "QF Jane", "ReviewID": "R35OQ9EBTHYFTH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a nice little point & shoot.

Well that quickly changed when I came across a CTFXC (Charles Trippy) video log.  I absolutely loved the video quality in his videos and I wanted to know what camcorder he had.  I was shocked to find out he was using a Cannon Powershot CAMERA!  I had no idea that a small powershot could make anything you film look so crisp and clear.  I was browsing around the market just for a camcorder but when I saw this baby... and boy my mind changed quick.  My first intention was to buy something like the flip hd or a sony bloggie, but after I saw some of the quality of the videos I was displeased.  Now Charles Trippy (youtube user) actually used a different powershot (I forgot which one) but they all have great video quality. So after watching a lot of vlogs (video logs) I decided to go a head and buy one of these powershots.  Now here are the Pros that this camera has.1. The price for a durable camera/camcorder. I actually bought mine for $125 off of amazon. :P2. The 14.1 MP.  Yes I know that there are other cameras that have a higher MP but i'm not using this camera just for picture taking which is why it doesn't matter to me.3. The size of the camera.  This puppy is SMALL in size and weight.  There are times where Ive put it in my pocket and forgot it was even there!4. Durability.  This thing is pretty durable to me.  Ive dropped it a couple of times and no scratches or marks on it.5. Shutter time.  This thing can take pictures pretty fast.6. Ease of use.  This is very easy to use and have no trouble what so ever.7. Video quality.  Man this is the reason why I wanted this camera and all I can say is im completely blown away at what this little camera can do.8. This camera does take good pictures as well.9. I love the sound quality on this camera!10. The color distinction is great.  Now the cons.1. The little plastic cover on the corner (the cover for the connectors) seems very fragile.2. Every now and then it bugs out when trying to take a picture in macro mode in sunlight.3. The zoom rocker can be pretty loud when taking a video but it doesn't bother me much.4. Sometimes after taking one macro photo it'll switch back to normal mode.  It doesn't bother me too much but I hate taking another photo expecting it to be a macro and it isn't.5. This is more personal, as I wish it had more settings to toggle with.Overall I give this camera 5 stars even with the 5 cons I have with it.I strongly recommend this powershot if you need a point and shoot camera!Ive had mine for three months and i'm loving every time I use it.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Christopher Miller", "ReviewID": "R3FNH7ITGQJBLV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this as a second camera, for when we didn't want to carry around a larger one.

Pretty much with every picture you need to use the flash to keep the noise down in anything but bright day light which makes the pictures look really fake.

I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift and after about 5 or so hours playing with it she got frustrated.  I decided to do side by side comparisons with the SD 1400 and our old SD 600 and believe it or not they were the same clarity wise.  The colors on the 1400 were a little more vibrant i'll give it that but I/we fully expected more. We have a baby on the way so the idea was to get something for the wife to capture the special moments that we really couldn't get with our older camera but after testing the 1400 on multiple subjects in various lighting the conclusion was what a waste of money if we kept it.

Images of the camera on Amazon just didn't prepare me for how small the thing is though. I'm 6'2\" and my hands dwarf this thing. When I shoot with two hands, its quite easy to block the flash with one of the fingers on my left hand. I've grown accustomed to using it one handed as a result. I can easily have one finger on the zoom slider and another on the shutter button. Regardless of how I hold it though, I'm sure to have the my hand through the strap. I've already fumbled and caught it twice, I wouldn't want it to hit the ground with that big screen on the back.It shoots HD video very well and I was pleased to find the small end of an HDMI cable I already have fits the camera. The little flap that covers the USB and HDMI ports is kind of annoying. I've never liked those kinds of covers. Its a piece of hard plastic with a flexible anchor that goes into the camera. The cover snaps in place and the fit is pretty seamless, but you have to bend it uncomfortably far to use the HDMI port. These kinds of small covers are common on cell phones and I see them broken all the time. I've never actually broken one myself, but I can see that being a possibility with the stress it'll go through from using the HDMI port. The location of the mini USB port, which will be used much more often, isn't as much of a concern, though.All of the buttons are tiny but not too much of a concern and, given the form factor, its to be expected. I've yet to make a mistaken button press. The zoom seems to operate too quickly though.Pictures are generally great. Its easy to get blurry images if you rush the auto focus though.

The SD1400 is the size of a deck of cards, and light enough that it can sit in a bag clipped to your belt all day without being noticed.  Although the SD1400 will fit into your jean's pocket, do NOT keep it in a pocket.  The lens drive is VERY fragile and can be damaged by pressure or a bit of dirt or grit.  It is a delicate precision instrument...keep it in a well padded bag when it is not in your hand.The \"auto\" mode on this camera does not work well.  It often selects too high an ISO and the selects the wrong focus point, and it over exposes photos.  The result is grainy photos that are in soft focus with washed out colors.Put the camera in \"Program mode\" and \"lock\" the ISO at ISO 200 or 100 for best results.  Use the \"center\" focus mode and select the primary subject and lock the focus before composing the photo.  Set exposure at minus 1/3 stop to get richer, warmer colors.The very small flash works best with the primary subject at a distance of three feet to seven feet and ISO locked at ISO 200.If you are using the flash heavily, the battery will last less than 200 photos.

However, I wanted something lightweight that I can carry with me all the time, almost like a phone.Used it for a trip outdoors. My friend has an old SLR which I kind of used to compare my photos with.Pros: Very very handy. In fact, I bought a cell phone holder to hook it up to my belt as the camera bags, even the smallest pouch was too big. This itself is worth buying this gizmo. Photo qualities are excellent over various light conditions. Obviously, as light falls down, outdoor shots outside the range of the flash do not come out very well. There is a auto mode and then there is a video HD mode, pretty standard. The manual mode allows various standard options.  Tried almost all options, the photos looked almost identical to my untrained eye. Even long range shots came out very well.Battery life decent, however, annoyingly, the transition from half full indicator to almost empty was very quick..My friends were uniformly impressed by its looks and performance too, it's that petite.Cons: 4 x zoom, may not be enough for some.Hardcore geeks may find the options limitedOn the whole, very very happy with this purchase.

It's both portable and functional! I've researched for about a month reading reviews after reviews before I decided on this camera. It was actually between its sister in the SD series :Canon SD980IS. One of the reasons I picked this instead of the other is because it was just simple to use. If you've ever had a canon camera it was a no-brainer. This Canon SD1400 gave me crisp shots of pictures where I can zoom in to even my frickles ( I sometimes did not like--haha). Another quality was its battery life; It had not failed me during my trips to the beach. Don't forget the vibrant color of the camera itself! But if pink is not one of the colors you like, you might not love this camera as much as I do.In conclusion, I absolutely love this camera for its looks, functions, and also the quality of the pictures.

If you don't believe me on the MP argument and market forces, just search Amazon.com for the SD750 and look what a camera I paid $200 for years ago costs today.  The new ones are in the $300 range (yes I undersand demand but that is in effect my point).The ELPH series has always been a great line of cameras in my opinion.  Having lost our SD750 and having a trip to Maui, we needed a new digital camera that would fit in a pocket.  I assumed that I could not go wrong with a Canon ELPH so I grabbed the SD1400 IS and took it straight to Maui.  We shot about 200 photos of the beach, restaurants, sailing trip, round of golf (including Kapalua Plantation).  I have taken older Canon ELPHs on many (many) trips and have always come home and enjoyed the pictures we have taken.  I have also enjoyed the Auto mode of those cameras.  Let me first say something positive.  The build quality of this camera may be the best I have seen from a Canon ELPH or any other point-and-shoot for that matter.  Very, very nice build quality.  However, early into using this SD1400 IS I saw that something was up with Auto mode as pictures in all sorts of situations just didn't look right... from color to lighting, etc.  It got to the point where I would take a picture in Auto mode AND then take in Program mode hoping for a good result from either.  It's like the camera was so smart it was trying to pick a \"mode\" in Auto yet the mode it chose was far from optimal. Far.With that said, I just reviewed about 200 photos from this camera from our trip to Maui and I would have to say I am highly unimpressed with the results in comparison to my old 3MP and 7MP Canon ELPHs.  I am very dissatisfied with what this camera produced. There are even pictures I took that looked amazing on the screen only to be OK-but-nothing-special when looked at on my Mac.  How do you make Kapalua look average?  If Canon wants to claim I have a defective unit and send me another one I would be more than glad to try again but at this point I just bit the bullet and bought the SD1300 IS hoping that 2 less megapixels will help.Like I said, I have always loved this line of cameras and I have never had to \"work\" to take great pictures.  Not only did I have to work to do so with this camera but even the results were less satisfying than what I am used to from a Canon ELPH product.

I had been using my professional cameras but it has become a hassle to tote around a 4 month old, her belongings AND a big bulky camera - Not to mention the extra shutter clicks I'm putting on my studio camera by taking a million and one pictures of my new baby!I did A LOT of research on Point and Shoots before purchasing this camera (at my local Best Buy).

This camera seemed to pack a lot of neat little features into a pocket size device. As soon as I got to my vehicle after purchasing this camera I opened the box, threw the battery and memory card in and fired off a picture. It was VERY soft, not crisp or clear at all. I got home and played with it some more, taking a little over 100 images in different modes inside and outside my house. The outdoor images, taken without any zoom came out OK, once I started to zoom in they became very soft and dark. I adjusted the ISO, the exposure compensation and the setting and it didn't seem to help. Indoors - forget about it. The pictures are terrible, not only are they soft but the color is WAY off, not matter how many times I adjust the white balance or change the settings. The flash is just ridiculous, too. The red eye function barely even works, every shot I've taken I've had to edit out red eye. If there is the slightest bit of darkness or low light the flash automatically kicks on (when using Auto Flash). I had a little more luck shutting the flash off, bumping up the ISO and compensating the exposure +1 - however, doing this, again causes very soft pictures. I've taken a total of 400 images in 6 days on this camera and maybe one or two came out well. That's not a very good ration, in my opinion!I expected with a 14MP camera to be getting nice sharp clear images.

I just loved my SD1000, but due to extensive use, it's having some intermittent problems with autofocus and image quality - still produces great images, just down to around 75% of the time.  I thought that the SD1400IS, after reviewing its specs and other reviews, would be a great upgrade/replacement.As for the issues with the SD1400IS that I experienced:** Images not always crisp - many slightly out of focus or worse (with IS, image stabilization, this should virtually not happen unless there is a little more than slight camera shake and I hold a non-IS pro camera that weighs considerably more and I don't have problems with out of focus images).** Many images \"grainy\", noted even at ISO 100 (should not be grainy at a low ISO with decent or better lighting)** Video pretty decent, but only in very good lighting.  In lighting that only a little low, the video looks pretty grainy.  I expected more for HD video.  My non-HD videos from my SD1000 are much better.** Illumination by the flash very limited - my SD1000 much better than the SD1400ISNow, I tried many of the modes and settings on the camera to make sure it was not a problem with one of them.  No difference in the issues noted.Maybe these issues were only with the SD1400IS that I tried out, though unlikely.  I returned it to the seller (Cameta Camera) via priority mail, insured, which cost me around $15.  I must say that they gave me no problems with the return (just followed the \"return instructions\" provided by Amazon) and they even refunded the shipping charge for getting it to me (not all sellers will do this).  So, one way to look at it is that I paid around $15 to try it out for a week.  I did get a few nice family snapshots and a few cute little videos of the kids.I absolutely love Canon.  I just think there are some issues with this particular model.  I would not hesitate to try out another one of models in the SD (\"Digital Elf\") line as the size is perfect (and the images great based on my SD1000 7.1 MP model).  I'm actually going to do so once I have a little extra time as I do want to upgrade and retire my SD1000.  Another series that's a little larger to try out is the Canon Powershot A series - I know people that have those and they produce very nice images.A few examples of non-snapshot images taken with my old Canon SD1000 (the one I want to upgrade from):[...] - abstract generated from shot taken with my SD1000[...] - panoramic landscape created from five shots taken with my SD1000Other images on my website are taken primarily with a Canon 40D (some with a Canon Rebel XT - I love the Rebel series for an affordable small digital SLR).One last word of advice - please try out more than the \"full auto\" mode when trying out a camera!

I tried again and several times it said the same thing. I tried the zoom on the camera and it got stuck in the process. It also made a clicking noise during the zooming that was not suppose to be there. I must stress that this was all discovered seconds after I opened the package.

The esthetics are as sharp as any mini camera on the market. Both the orange and black look fantastic. It is also shockingly small. It is light but has a reassuring heft and solidity to it as well. When you first see it and pick it up, one can only be impressed by what seems to be a stunning engineering feat.Now, this is where things go downhill. I have medium sized hands. The buttons are tiny. They are frustratingly small, to the point where you are advised to use your fingernails rather than fingers to operate the tiny, recessed controls. The beauty of flushed controls gives way to the reality of fumbling with them when you actually want to operate the camera.Second, the picture quality, at least in moderate to low light situations, seems uniformly poor. I had pretty high hopes, since it is 14 mp, and has solid reviews on websites which have reviewed numerous cameras. Nonetheless, personally speaking, I am underwhelmed by picture quality. Even with what seems like an extremely powerful flash, moderate to low light photos wind up looking very washed out.The menu is a source of frustration as well. Part of this as I mentioned, is due to the small buttons. However, the menu system icons and arrangement of functions on-screen is nowhere close to intuitive. If you can keep trying through trial and error, you'll figure things out, but it is by no means simple or intuitive.The video. The 720 hd video is my favorite feature. I think video quality is pretty darn good. It is by far the most useful feature, since the photos themselves are of only average quality. There is a significant downside. The hd video clips top out at 10 minutes and you must re-start with a new recording at that point. You can shot in standard def, and there is a 4 gb limit there as well. This is fine for making brief clips, but if you want to record a sports event or speech, it's really pointless trying to use this camera as a video recorder.The documentation. The manual is very bare bones. It gives you just enough information to get started, and that is it. You are on your own in figuring out how to shoot non-automatic photos. That you discover strictly through trial and error. The manual now has been downgraded in paper quality. It used to be printed on glassy paper, and came in a slim, clear, re-sealable plastic wrapper, which allowed you to tote around the manual and keep it in more or less pristine condition. Now, the manual comes printed on low quality paper and a bag that you cannot reseal.The covering for the usb cable is also poorly designed. Perhaps they were unable to solve the conundrum of how to create a functional hinge on a camera with such tight dimensions. Nonetheless, you cannnot open this cover beyond 45 degrees without feeling like you will break it off.Once you get past the attractive exterior, you realize that the camera does not take very good photos and while the video recording quality is good, the 10 minute limit makes this feature much less useful and appealing than it could be.In other words, aside from esthetics, size and weight, the quality of the camera's actual functions is far from impressive. Once Canon starts to invest some money in actually producing a camera that takes excellent pictures and videos longer than a music video, they will have a winner here. So far, that's not the case.Finally, I see that a lot of the recent reviews are not very positive. This likely reflects the fact that the price has now gone up significantly from around $150 to $180-200. This is probably enough of an increase to get reviewers grading it according to the criteria of a significantly more expensive camera. Even if it were being sold at the old holiday promotion price, I still could not recommend it.

Durability: This is an indirect assessment...I carried it in my pockets for about 3 months and there is no visible scratching etc, though watch out for lint around the optical moving parts.4. Battery life: Very good (at least initially). Used a bit judiciously (~75 snaps,3 vids of 30 sec each a day, ) I have managed to take photos/videos for about 5 days worth of vacations.5. HD video: This is great to have on a small camera. Just be prepared for the disk space its going to swallow.Now I will actually see how much serious photography it is capable of.

The problems that I have had with this camera are due to being kind of hard on them because I use it for work in adverse conditions and travel a lot.

But about the same time, Canon released an even smaller yet full-featured camera, the SD780 (still the smallest Elf to date).  I wavered between the two, and finally went with the SD780.  It was unique in the Canon line and, despite being the smallest Canon ever, it had HD video and even a tunnel vision viewfinder.  The professional reviews weren't especially kind to photo quality, but the camera was selected one of the ten best new products of the year by Macworld magazine and received higher ratings from Amazon reviewers than most other Canon cameras (4 1-2 stars vs. 4).Then I lost my SD780. This time I purchased a like-new SD1400.  It has more surface area to grasp, a bigger screen, slightly better zoom, a few additional settings and innovations, and it fits into the same Canon case as the SD780.  I have noticed a few quirks--the buttons on the back aren't as accessible (they're flush and even recessed with the camera's back), the zoom control is small and not as intuitive to operate, the auto setting tends to give me overly warm exposures.Then I found my SD780. Recently, I took it to the county fair on an especially bright and hot day.  I would have had to guess while aiming each shot and video were it not for the tunnel-vision viewfinder the Canon managed to squeeze into its tiniest of all Elphs!  Returning from the fair, I was amazed at the quality of the photos--whether outside in the blazing, high sun or inside the livestock barns, the auto settings were perfect, the colors accurate, the pictures sharp.  And the movies plus sound played great on my Sony flat screen.I almost forgot that this started out as a review of the SD1400.  It's a fine camera, with slightly larger dimensions than the SD780, and the bigger screen is bound to appeal to many users, especially those for whom a viewfinder is gratuitous. Moreover, it has written prompts that show on the screen, frequently making unnecessary another review of the manual (most of which is on line). Still, it doesn't strike me as anything like a \"grand finale\" to the Canon SD line of Elve (more likely Canon was anxious to begin their next line, beginning in 2011--no more SD initials to decode: simply Canon Elph 100, Elph 300, etc.From now on, the SD780 travels with me, too small to make a leather case especially practical: the 780 simply slips into any convenient pocket and is always ready to go if you can remember which pocket.  As for this SD1400, it stays home, always charged and ready for action the moment the cats come up with their latest crazy stunt.  (For nature shooting, or recording the action at your son's Little League or your daughter's soccer game, you can't beat the sharp and fast (outdoors) telephoto lens of the Canon SX230 telephoto lens--which I would have never added to my collection were it not for a visit to the Canon site, where the camera was being phased out at a price almost a 3rd that of either a new SD780 or SD1400.

If you zoom in much at all, the picture becomes grainy and dark. With minimal zooming or no zoom at all, however, the pictures tend to be great! Also, when taking videos particularly, the camera seems to take a while to focus. So if you are trying quickly to get a video started, sometimes the result can be blurry.

I mean that the 630 had a lot of excess bulge around the screen whereas the 1400's screen pushes pretty much right up to the edges of the camera.the only real \"con\" I have is the zoom level is pretty small and the first week I used it was on a ski trip and I was trying to use it with gloves on. With that said I think it helped learning the feel of it with reduced dexterity because now I know exactly how to hit everything I want.

It's no DSLR, but I wasn't expecting it to be at all (like some other reviewers seemed to). :) The quality is great, and even if I crop a picture to pieces there are enough MP to still keep the fantastic quality. I really love some of the creative modes offered, especially the fake tilt shift ('miniature') mode! There are many modes and settings that help you sort of 'edit' your photo without having to wait until you download it onto the computer, then open the editing program, work on it, resave, etc. A feature that I hadn't read before that didn't much attention was the ability to take widescreen pictures, which I think is pretty nifty. When people have seen the pictures, then seen the tiny pink camera I used to take the picture (it's smaller than my Blackberry!) they can't believe their eyes! I'm not using it for professional pictures - most are just for personal use and Facebook. For those uses, the quality is MORE than amazing.The auto mode is perfect for quick shots, or when someone else is using your camera. The manual setting is very easy to get the hang of, and it keeps the settings you've made for the next time you turn on your camera (even if you switch to Auto or Video mode). Very handy!My absolute favorite feature is the self timer. You can custom set it to however many seconds, and then set how many pictures you want it to take. If you set it at 10 seconds/20 pictures, it counts down to ten seconds and then every few seconds after that it takes a new picture. The light lets you know when a picture is about to be taken, and you can usually hear the shutter go off in between each one, too. It's great for taking pictures of yourself or with friends without making one friend be the cameraman. Just prop the camera onto a table or tripod, set the timer, and get ready to pose!As far as shipping was concerned, I got free 2-day shipping through Amazon Prime (student account). We had a terrible bout of snow the day before it was due to be at my doorstep, and it was enough snow and ice to cancel all the K-12 schools in the area and even my university (which rarely closes)!

But you can't expect a compact cam to capture noise-less images. The previous model - the SD1300IS is known to have better image quality than the SD1400IS, however, if you are not going to use the image for poster prints, and won't be needing to see each and every pixel of the 14MP Image, then you'll soon find the pictures to be Excellent.The New Smart Auto mode works quite well and surprisingly quickly.Macro images are sharp and clear.The HD Video (720p) quality is good, but don't compare it with a camcorder,The exterior has smooth and sleek rounded edges and feels nice taking pictures.Continuous shooting is slower than my previous model - SD790IS.Also I miss the Quick-Select Dial on the SD790IS. Selecting the desired Program Mode on the SD1400 does take longer.Face Detection Self-timer and Smile Shutter are good add-ons, though difficult to set giving the recessed buttons and lengthy menu selection using 2 buttons only.Its got a mini HDMI output, but Canon doesn't include the HDMI cable with it, correctly to reduce unnecessary cost.Battery/Memory compartment is nicer than before, and can take constant opening and closing for a long life. Battery Life is excellent as usual.Overall, the Camera is worth the price I paid for it, and I got what I really needed.

It has a lot of megapixels, 4x zoom, takes HD video, it's compact and stylish; great.  The lens extends with precision the moment you power it up, implying a high level of attention to detail; cool.  Unfortunately, once you try to use the camera it's another story.,Around 10-20% of my pictures come out unacceptable -- either out of focus or the lighting looks wrong (compare that to a nearly 100% success rate I had with my old PowerShot SD600, circa 2006).  Even on the \"good\" pictures, the huge number of megapixels doesn't add much detail compared to the 6 megapixels of the older PowerShot.  Operation of the SD1400IS is sluggish.  Everything seems to take a half a second too long -- all those megapixels come at a price.The image and HD video files this camera produces are huge and transfer slowly; slow enough that I cannot play the HD videos over my 802.11g wifi in realtime.  While this is a characteristic of 14 megapixels and HD video in general, not a fault of this camera specifically, it is something to consider.One annoying quirk of the SD1400IS: When you press the shutter button to take a picture you have to stop at the halfway down position and wait for it to focus, otherwise it may not take the picture.  This is ridiculous.  On most cameras stopping at the halfway position is optional, something you only need to be cognizant of if you want the extra control it gives you.  Even though now I'm used to this, it's hard to explain to anyone who I hand the camera to.  If I ask someone to take a picture with me in it, often they try but the camera comes back with no picture actually taken.  Using the self timer isn't a solution -- the camera body is too narrow and rounded for the camera to stand up by itself on all but the most flat level surface.  Yes, it has a tripod mount, but carrying a tripod around defeats the purpose of having a compact point & shoot.The video is a mixed bag.  It's HD, great, but you can't use the optical zoom while shooting.  Worse, it doesn't refocus while shooting video.  If your baby is taking his first steps and is walking towards you he will start out in focus then become out of focus as the distance changes.  With proper planning maybe you can get around this -- take your videos in a way where the distance to the subject doesn't change (like taking the baby walking from the side) -- but it's really not what you want.  Sometimes this forces you to shoot your video in several short clips instead of one long clip.  There is an in-camera tool for trimming videos but unfortunately nothing that lets you combine your short clips into the one long clip you actually wanted.  That said, in my usage there are a lot of times when I can work around these limitations and get a good result, so the video feature is usable.Overall the camera does basically work; I haven't tossed it yet.  If it was a cheap no-name camera it might get three stars on its actual merits, but I'm knocking off a star because it falls so far short of expectations.  It is very compact and stylish, so if these are your most important considerations then add a star or two.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Easy to use, easy to carry", "Author": "Rafa.el.Guerrero", "ReviewID": "RO0ILD4UI8NZY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very light camera, before this one i tested canon sd3500 which i returned as it failed and the images of people were distorted. the nikon coolpix s4000 which was sloooow but good pics.This one gives great people/group shots, rendering good colors, is easy to set for beach mode, and I even tried low light with a ok pictures.

I waited a long time to upgrade to get a camera with image stabilization at a reasonable price because I found on my prior camera the photos would often blur just from the action of pressing the shutter and the shake from the shutter motor.  With this Canon, I find the image stabilization worthless and as if non-existant.  Almost everytime I want to take a night photo, I get the warning to use a tripod.  Sure why don't I just do that and by the time I set up the tripod, the photo opportunity is way gone.  Went out on a boat on Biscayne Bay to watch the New Year's fireworks over Miami last night.  The city looked wonderful in the display, but as another reviewer mentioned, everytime I pressed the shutter button halfway to shoot the skyline, it would totally darken out and be underexposed.  I tried adjusting the settings manually to no avail and missed much of the party fooling around with this camera trying to get a better shot.  When the fireworks started, I switched to the \"Fireworks\" setting.  Great idea to have this setting, but the camara takes so long to snap the photo, the fireworks would just about be gone.  Switched to \"continuous shooting\" to catch the fireworks, but it still just took single shots.  I have no idea why they have a continuous shooting option, if it doesn't work.  Finally switched it to the movie mode to get the fireworks.  That did a better job, but I wanted still shots, not a movie or I would have purchased a camcorder.  Tried taking some pictures of the people on the boat and all came out blurry.  Sure with the waves, the boat is rocking, but isn't that what the image stabalization should correct?  So, basically I had a camera with me and yet no decent photo memories of the evening.  Also when you start to take the photo, it frames subjects by its choice.  You can't move the frames.  It often doesn't frame what I think it should.  The door to open the cable connections dosen't swing open all the way.  To get it out of the way to insert a cable, you have to open upward instead of outward as the directions say and it feels like it is going to break off.  Get yourself a card reader for about $15 to avoid having to use the cables.  The wide angle takes very inclusive photos, but everytime I turn on the camera, initially everything appears so far away that I have to zoom in at least one setting.  Again this delays the shot and the moment could be gone.  When you turn off the camera, it dosen't keep the zoom level.

My little flip camcorder takes much, much better video.  Also, the zoom in/ zoom out button on this camera is horribly placed and way too small.  It's a joke! The one thing this camera has going for it is the size and aesthetics.  So, if you want a beautifully crafted point-and-shoot that's small enough to put \"anywhere\" and couldn't care less about the picture quality, go out and buy the SD1400IS.

The SD1400 was well reviewed on Consumer Reports and CameraLabs.com, and had decent reviews elsewhere, so I decided to give it a shot.I am mostly pleased. The images produced are very good. Not great, but very good. I thought I would see more detail with 14.1 megapixels, but the images produced are not substantially better than my 7MP A560, as far as I can tell. I do sometimes experience an out of focus image - not often, but probably more than I did with the A560. I also prefer to use the 'P' (program) mode instead of the 'Auto' mode. Usually I find I have to reduce the exposure compensation a bit.The camera's controls and features work well.  The color swap and miniature modes are fun. The buttons are small, but that's the way it goes when the camera body is miniaturized. The camera's small size make it easy to carry anywhere, which is what I wanted.  My camera was made in Japan.

I previously had another Canon model that was bigger and bulkier and took really poor low-light photos.  My girlfriend has a Sony that is compact but also takes really poor low-light photos.  I was finding more and more that when traveling or just being out and about in the area that it wasn't convenient to continually have to \"unpack\" my bulky camera and then be disappointed in the night shots (which seemed to be accounting for a pretty high percentage of the pictures I was taking).  So my goal was to have a true pocket-sized camera that takes great low-light photos.  After reading several reviews of the Canon Powershot SD1400IS here on Amazon.com and even in Consumer Reports it appeared that low-light shots were a strength for this model and of course it is very compact as well.After taking several shots at Disney in Orlando while on a recent vacation (including quite a few nighttime shots featuring Christmas lights) I can honestly say I am really impressed with the quality of the photos in general and the nighttime photos in particular.My only complaint (which keeps me from giving the camera a five star rating) is that the camera feels like it has to be handled with care.  The body appears to be made out of some sort of metal which means it's kind of slick to the touch---if dropped I'm sure the camera would shatter into a thousand pieces.  Canon should have made the body rubberized to protect it and make it easier to hold or at least used a strong plastic with some kind of grip (like my previous Canon).  It's great that the camera is so small but the catch-22 is that adult hands have to be extra-careful when handling it.Overall though--I am very happy with the camera and would highly recommend it to a prospective buyer.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect little camera", "Author": "GIFD", "ReviewID": "RSITPS42HMYLC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a semi-professional photographer, and have been shooting with SLR's and DSLR's for years.

I do not like to give up control over shutter and aperture normally, but the automatic program on this Canon exceeded my expectations and proved to be quick and efficient in the varying situations it was put in.Picture quality is very good, relatively to compact cameras, but of-course doesn't compare to my DSLR's.Overall, I am very pleased with this camera, it's small and sleek appearance combined with solid performance is the perfect combination for me.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sleek, Handy but Delicate", "Author": "crudbug", "ReviewID": "R11QQS4SDFTLR3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after doing a lot of research on the camera.

Howard", "ReviewID": "RWZVZXJD9IACH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me first start by saying that this is the 2nd Cannon SD1400 I have purchased.  I bought a black one from Best Buy first then a silver one from Amazon later.  I'm not sure if it's because of the color difference or if there has simply been a change in manufacturing locations.  The first black one I bought from Best Buy was actually made in Japan.  The silver one from Amazon is made in China.  Normally that wouldn't be a big deal to me, but I did notice differences between the two cameras.  The one made in Japan had a slightly better resolution screen on the back and was much faster moving through the menu system.  The one made in China had a lower resolution screen and doesn't move as quickly through the menu items.  I can't say that I notice a difference in picture quality so the important part seems to work the same.  You can definitely save a few dollars by ordering from Amazon, but be aware you may wind up with a little slower Chinese made model compared to if you bought it elsewhere.For the real review section here's what I think of the camera.  First the size is wonderfully small.  It's so easy to carry, it's a very compact camera and has no sharp edges on it.  Secondly are the buttons.  They can be somewhat hard to find and press because they are completely smooth next to the surface of the camera.  You can't necessarily go just by feel, you need to look at what you are pressing to make sure it's the right button.  Picture quality seems to be very good when the right picture mode is used.  In auto mode it does a good job of trying to guess and pictures usually turn out just fine.  However sometimes it doesn't do it properly and then you need to change it to manual mode.  You can adjust just about every setting you can think of in manual mode.  The one I have found most useful is Low Light mode.  You will always want to switch to this when shooting in low light conditions.  It makes a world of difference in how the picture turns out.So 4 out of 5 stars seems about right for this camera.  It's very good but not perfect at everything.  You only get 4x optical zoom because of the small form factor.  You do have digital zoom to go further if you really need to.  Overall if you need a small camera that can take great pictures this camera will work for you.  If you need more optical zoom or professional looking photos you will need to buy a bigger more expensive camera.

In comparison to the SD900, the images are not as sharp. The indoor photos I took just all seem bland. It's not as apparent as it should be which areas are in focus and which are just a bit off. Compared to my older SD550, the image quality is about the same. Perhaps a little less quality.I expect Canon Powershot cameras to be simply outstanding. I expect very good image quality and a level of sharpness which makes the difference between stunning and typical. This camera is disappointing in these aspects compared to previous Canon cameras I have had and I will be returning it.As far as compactness and looking sleek, this camera does stand out, however. Also, there are a lot of features and shooting modes which complement the overall package.

I agonized over various models and decided on the SD1400IS. (I researched on Amazon and Consumer Reports websites.)The Panasonic Lumix is better for someone who wants to have more control over the camera. It has more bells and whistles and things to adjust. I was turned off by the Nikon Coolpix because once you drop it, it's $100 to repair, and I know I'll drop this at some point. (Thank you to the reviewers that let me know about this issue!) I had a Canon before so I knew I'd be basically familiar with the new one.My old camera was metal (I think), easy to hold, so very easy to use, and the quality was very good. I was apprehensive with the new one--would it be too small, too difficult to turn on, to hold, to move out of the way of the flash? Well, thanks to all of the reviewers, I knew what to expect.It is a very thin camera and therefore a little awkward for the first week, trying to make sure it didn't fall out of my hand (I'm a one-hand photographer [not one-handed; I just like to use one hand]). But I got used to this very quickly. The on-off button is flush with the camera's body and must be pressed _below_ the body, but again, I knew about it and it's not that big a deal--unless you have big or calloused fingers. The flash location is another known issue, but it's been an easy adjustment to train myself to get my hand out of the way.The buttons on the back of the camera are similar to my old camera and so were intuitive when figuring out what they did. So far, everything is similar. I haven't had to open the manual. The battery door looks delicate, but I know about it, so I'm careful.The LCD is much bigger than I'm used to, and it's great.

I promptly hung up and called customer no service and they dug around and came up with a ticket number.  They told me that it might be a refurbished camera, they weren't sure.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and told him that I paid for a new camera and that's what I expected to receive.  I called yet another office and the rep said that a new one had been shipped.  It arrived - refurbished and without the batteries that I had sent them.I wrote a 9 page fax to the supervisor that I had spoken to, explaining that I refused to accept a refurbished camera, along with all the pertinent information.  Hearing nothing from him, I faxed it again.  I surfed around and came up with their President & CEO's name and telephone number.Called their New York headquarters and sent their President & CEO the 9 page fax.  Never heard a word.  Sent it again the next week, asking for assistance.I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and two weeks later, I received a phone call from a sheepish person who offered no apologies,other than to tell me that if I sent my refurbished camera to them, she would send me a new one, along with three new batteries.

I was looking for a replacement and looked at reviews for this Camera. It had a lot of the features the SD850IS had, such as Color Accent, Maco Mode, Kids and Pet, Underwater etc. It was also a nice looking camera and supposedly shot in 720p HD, which I thought was a plus - and being 14.1MP compared to the SD850's 8, I figured this was a sure thing. I WAS WRONG!I played with the camera for hours and hours testing the various functions and video. The video quality is TERRIBLE! It is grainy and has a lot of noise (when I say noise, I mean the quality of the picture) for something which claims to be HD and the microphone is super sensitive so good luck shooting video outside if there is any wind at all. It shoots at 720p with a 30 fps refresh rate, which you would think was ok....When I uploaded the video to my computer, it looked even worse - I was totally disappointed.The camera's picture quality was also not that great! It may be 14.1 mega pixels, but the only thing that lets you do is print bigger, crappier photos. I feel like none of the pictures were clear - the best photos it took were only outside but even then, I was still not impressed. The low light feature wasn't that great either - the pictures were very grainy. The SD850 took better quality photos and it's only 8 mega pixels! Auto mode is also terrible - I'd say about 90% of the pictures taken in Auto mode were blurry and not focused well at all. The Auto Macro...ugh - always out of focus or blurry. I have to say the new Miniature Mode feature was pretty cool,  the larger LCD display was nice looking, and it was cool you could pick from a few different colors as well, but those were the only features this camera had which I liked.The buttons are also super small! - I have small hands and still found it a little tedious to press the buttons. I do understand that this is not a professional camera, but that is no excuse. The SD850IS shot amazing photos compared to this one and the video quality wasn't too shabby.

I have since read other reviews of the SD1400is that claimed that Canon is now using plastic lenses on their PowerShot lineup instead of glass.  If this is true, maybe that would explain the difference in image quality.  After being a loyal Canon PowerShot customer for over a decade, I will now turn to other camera manufacturers to replace our SD800is when it finally does stop working.

I used the camera for about 2 weeks before the E32 Lens Error became a frequent occurance. This Error makes the camera unusable by shutting the camera down, so it must then be reset by turning it back on.  After some internet research, it appears that this is a fairly common occurance in the SD 1400 camera. Camera lens alignment is a critical issue, and with the zoom being so broad, the chance for dust, debris, etc. to work its way into the lens mechanism is common.  Canon makes top quality cameras, and I've had several, but I would stay away from the SD 1400. This camera is manufactured in China, which is not necessarily a bad thing, as they show steady product improvement.  However, after more research I purchased a Panasonic Lumix ZS6 which I've had for 2 weeks with no problems so far. For an extra $50, this is a much better camera - period.

That really bugs me for some weird reason. I mean why does it has to be there? Why not make it a full 3.0\" screen. Personally, I like big screens to look at pictures. As far as quality goes, it gets a bit shaky here and there. It's hard for me to take motion pictures of kids and sports environment.

It was an old camera (5 years) but had served me well.  I decided to upgrade to this guy and I'm sorry I did.  For the increase in cost, I got some \"features\" I will never use and the images are less than impressive.DETAILS:  (1)  The flash timing on this camera is terrible.  It routinely blows away fair skinned people, leaving them ghostly white blurs.  Furthermore, the camera actually ends up with after-images on many of the flashed shots.  I had a minolta 35mm 20 years ago that did not do this -- why the regression Canon???  I'm tempted to put a piece of scotch tape over the flash to ease it up a bit -- the thing is just too bloody \"hot\".  (2)  The AV door is nearly impossible to open with long sharp fingernails, a knife, or something small and pointy.  The way it rotates also makes it difficult to hook up an HDMI or USB cable.  I'm very very very tempted to just bust off the door and improve the functionality of the camera in this regard.  (3)  The Image Stabilization doesn't seem to work.  My old A series (without image stabilization) performed better than this camera.  (4)  The colors are -- interesting.  Out of the box this camera seems to really like to bleach out skin tones -- it's almost a bit \"cold\" and bluish.  Sure, I could photoshop every image, but why would I buy a point-and-shoot for that?  It would be nice to simply have the camera's colors close to real instead of interpreted by a fancy Digic4 image smasher.  (5)  This camera misses more shots than it takes.  Once again, comparing to a 5-year old A series that's half the cost.  I find that it's time-to-shoot-after-button-press is quite a bit delayed, even for a point-and-shoot.So, for those reasons, this is a 2 star purchase.  Sure, it's one of their flagship models and it is small - but small is only worth so much if the images are consistently thrown out!!!My suggestion:  Buy this camera and some scotch tape and remove the AV door and you might be coming close to what a $100 A-series can do.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "usual", "Author": "bisa", "ReviewID": "RDYUXID6WZK1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The shots look great on LCD screen, but once you transfer it in to computer the quality of the pictures are not that satisfying.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, but battery drain is pretty quick", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "RXH20DAZSXTYT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great Camera, but battery drain is pretty quick.I own this and a Canon SLR camera and the SLR has much beteer battery life.

I'm sure it's not the longest battery life around, but I was able to use it for a full day of touring around (in freezing cold weather), and the battery was only half used up.  Of course, as the battery gets older, the charge gets shorter (but that's with any battery)--The battery charger folds up to a small square that is easy to carry around, and has an indicator that tells you when it's done chargingCons:--No viewfinder (but, really, when do you ever use that thing with a point-and-shoot anyway?)--(Although not a problem for me), the buttons are a little small, so if you don't like small buttons, you might not like these.--They don't give you the USB chord to connect the camera to your computer, but it's one of those standard fire-wire chords which I already own about 5 of, so it's not a big deal, just kind of odd...Overall, I highly recommend this camera.

I found out to my dismay that the camera was completely useless for shooting the aerobatics, because the image stabilizer mechanism was not able to withstand the slight vibrations of the airplane, and amplified them, whether it was turned on or off.  The resulting image was very choppy. A much simpler camera without a stabilizer produced a clean and stable picture when connected to the same mount on the same airplane.  I assume that you will run into similar problems with this camera if you try it with bikes, cars, etc.  As far as shooting video from the ground, I could not see any difference between the stabilizer turned on or off.Other than that, the sound recording quality is pretty good, and the video, if you shoot it from the ground, is reasonably good.  Single shots are also good.  The rechargeable battery lasts a long time.  I didn't measure, but several hours for sure, and replacing a battery, in case it does run out, is a snap.  The camera is small and easily fits in the pocket, and has a pretty good and intuitive user interface.

I currently use a Cannon Powershot SD890 IS, before that I had the 870 and before that I had another.  SO I need to upgrade I ordered after looking at all the reviews and test photos from users the Cannon Powershot SD970 IS - RETURNED IT.  The quality of the photos, the pixels, sharpness and color where all OFF.  I figured ok give it another shot, returned the 2nd one.  Then I figured maybe it was just that model. NO. I ordered the Cannon Powershot SD 1400 in this orange color.  Straight out of the box comparing photos of the SD890IS which is TEN (10) megapixels and has a dig 3 proc.  where as this model as the next processor up and is suppossed to be FOURTEEN (14) megapixels.  Megapixels alone the quality sharpness of the photos should be better then my old less megapixel cam NO!!!!hand!!!! in the same place in the same EXACT lighting seconds apart at the same range ........MY OLD CANNON SD890IS which is TEN (10) megapixels took a SHARPER photo I could zoom in on the photo and see my fingerprints and so forth with this cam the SD1400IS everything was LACKING detail, sharpness completely.  I could not see my any detail at all it was like someone went into adobe and did Gaussian blur on the whole photo.  ALSO in video, there was a dead pixel, which shows up as a white pixel in playback ruining ur video.I have already printed out the return label.  I know how to change settings and adjust photos and do all the tricks....however if you do NOT HAVE a photo that has definition, sharp pixels and basically in simple terms a decent editable photo.......why would u own that cam? YOU WOULD NOT.  I will be more then happy to send ANYONE sample photos which are electronically tagged by the cam so you know which cam took which photo of the same subject in the same lighting.OH and this cam says it is good for low light ya right if you want to have what looks like an overexposed shot and lack all detail.I do not know what is wrong with cannon I have been a customer of their video cam and point and shoot for over 15 years and now at 32 years old I have to change brands bc the quality of their product is SO AWFUL and frustrating for someone who is an avid hobby photographer I am just..beyond upset bc after years of hard use my SD890IS is on its last limbs I have had to pop the case and repair it after dropping and do not know how much longer it will last. I can say with a heavy heart CANNON is NO LONGER the company to trust ur memories to.  so depressing.  If you want to see the sample photos please let me know and I will send you a copy.I had such high hopes again I am just ..I know I am repeating myself but I just CANNOT BELIEVE HOW AWFUL nearly every cam in their line is poor in terms of photo quality and video quality....I tried to dif ones...now I have to look elsewhere GOOD BYE CANNON I want good clear quality photos not blurry bad ones.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "butterfingers", "Author": "Gonzo F.
