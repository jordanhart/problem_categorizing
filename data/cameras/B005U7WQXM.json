The cameras I bought were 3.6mm.  They capture my entire front yard and the night vision is excellent.  I replaced older cameras, and these cost much less than my original cameras and are MUCH better.  I have bought several cameras from this seller and I've been happy with all of them.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "CCTV camera", "Author": "A.

In daylight mode the picture is kinda blurry and there is no adjustment for focusing. Night vision actually looks better then daylight mode, but is still blurry. These cameras are better then my 420 tv line cameras though. Also, these camera's are not wide angle cameras. There is no fish eye look to the image. It has a normal range of view.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good quality.", "Author": "N.
