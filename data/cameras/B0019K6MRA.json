By March, 2 out of 3 were broken.  The little joist stick on one broke off inside and made it nearly impossible to navigate and the LCD on the other stopped functioning.  I filed an RMA request on the Argus website and received an RMA# and shipping instructions fairly quickly, but it all went down hill from there.  The post office tried to deliver the package for almost a month before it was finally delivered.Delivered, April 27, 2009, 10:04 am, DUNDEE, IL 60118Notice Left, April 18, 2009, 9:49 am, DUNDEE, IL 60118Notice Left, April 09, 2009, 9:33 am, DUNDEE, IL 60118Arrival at Unit, April 09, 2009, 7:33 am, DUNDEE, IL 60118Processed, April 09, 2009, 12:22 am, ELK GROVE VILLAGE, IL 60007I tried to call to get an update, but it is impossible to talk to anyone at their number, just a recorded voice saying go to the website.  They have not cashed the $10 check I sent in the box to cover return shipping.  I have sent emails asking for an update, but have not received a reply.  It is like this company does not exist anymore.  I will be filing a complaint with the BBB next week if I do not get a reply to the email I sent today.If I could give less than one star, I would!", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for Active Kids", "Author": "BionicPelvis", "ReviewID": "R1ID6B5OFTSUFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my 6-year-old nephew.  He had a kiddie camera before, but it turned out to be a piece of garbage and he quickly lost interest.  I chose this camera based on the reviews here, and have been very pleased.  My nephew can easily operate all the camera functions by himself, including changing the camera modes, taking pictures, and navigating through his pictures.  It is just the right size for him to handle comfortably, and rugged enough for a little boy.  The caribiner is great, and makes it easy to carry the camera on his backpack or belt loop.  He brought it to school the other day, and I hear this little camera was the hit of the class!  Overall, this camera has exceeded my expectations and was a much better bargain than any kid-specific camera we've tried.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Happy with my decision!", "Author": "J.

After reading the reviews on that camera, I decided my kids probably wouldn't be please with the quality of the pictures, so I opted to by this 3 Mp digital camera instead (the Little Tykes was less than 1 Mp.)  My daughters, ages 2 & 5 both loves their Beans.  They like seeing the picture & video on the screen & they like to clip the camera on their clothes.  I am so happy that I decided to get this one instead!", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUT THIS CAMERA", "Author": "CG", "ReviewID": "R35BPZPNOFHKAW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is terrible. It was given as a gift for our son and it has not worked since we opened the package.The LCD screen displays intermittently displays a picture or grey lines (i.e., no picture), most time has been on the grey lines.Support on their web site is terrible and we cannot claim a warranty because it was a gift (i.e., no receipt).
