{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works well, nice compact size", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R30UOC8Z210JQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I put in a security system myself because of an irritating neighbor who was banging on my house and making noise. This ended the problem immediately.this camera comes with audio and video cable and power supply. Also includes hardware.I have two of these, and two larger ones, and use them for my internet based ip-cam security, which lets me access the cameras via my phone or tablet any time, or even start recording from those devices. In daylight the color is vivid and visibility is quite far. At night, I'd say visibility indoors pretty well covers my whole living room area. Outdoors visibility is also around 10-15 feet; the camera infra-red LED's glow red at night, so it is clear to anyone that a camera is operating and this is a plus.You cannot place these cameras inside a glass window for outdoor viewing at night; the infra red light reflects off the glass and just makes a big white patch. For outdoor use they need to be placed outdoors, unless you are just interested as I am in what goes on at my house while I am at work during the day. It really is nice to be able to look in and out of my house anytime. At night, I can easily use my phone or tablet in seconds if I hear any noises, and can see if anyone is in the house. On a cool note, I have 5 cats and their eyes glow bright white so I can see where they are at night.These cameras are not designed to make a hollywood quality movie, but rather just to help you be aware of and record any intruders. They capture colors well during the day.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great savings, good camera.", "Author": "Jun", "ReviewID": "R2PDFNB575KQTJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The discount on this camera was great. The image quality was clear and the night vision is \"good enough.\" To compensate for the camera's 16-ft. night vision, I mounted reflective tape on the far end of its view. The video show is in color with full light, or black and white when night vision is engaged. Also, the cable from the camera is short, but a 50-60 ft. extension cord is included.However, minus one (1) star for having the microphone on the short cable (rather than mounted in the housing).Overall, very happy with this purchase (bought 2 at the heavily discounted price). Using them outside, under the backyard toolshed eaves.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good inexpensive camera", "Author": "Joseph M Rizzo", "ReviewID": "RPPT394F6WEPY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Picture is OK but for the money it is better than what I expected.
