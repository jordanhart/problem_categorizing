The pictures are crystal clear, and the camera itself is super easy to use and understand.  The one, and ONLY thing, I don't like is that you cannot hear the audio on the camera when playing back videos (you have to plug it into a computer or tv to hear audio).

I did a TON of research into digital cameras....for over a year or so and finally decided upon this one.  I bought it at Best Buy when it was first released and the price could not be beat.  I literally bought it the day my new nephew was born and it only took about 15 minutes learn to use.  The pictures turned out great and the modes are super easy to use.  Only a couple turned on blurry, but I believe that was more the photographer than the camera.  There is a power saver option that comes on to reserve the battery power.  I do however suggest buying rechargable batteries.  This camera is super great for the price compared to Canon and Nikon.  The software is super easy to use as well.  I suggest this camera for first time digital camera users such as myself.

I liked this camera mostly because of the price and brand. It takes good pictures outdoor in normal mode. The battery life is good and Sony recommends using rechargeable batteries, works ok. I also bought a 1GB card, got a nice deal on it. With a 1GB card, in excess of 300 photos can be taken.  Good macro shots.  Ease of use/ no setting required.After about a month of usage, am not really happy with this.  1. It doesn't have a timestamp feature, meaning when saving pictures to computer it doesn't imprint the date/time. You can may find some tools to get after u download.  2. In the night mode/Slow flash mode the picture is ALWAYS blurred. The object being photograph has to be dead still, any slight movement and the photo will be blurred. I had similar features on other brands/Sony  camera and use  to like it a lot.  3. I couldn't turn the flash off for taking pictures thru glass or of reflective objects( i didn't read the manual, this may be available).  4. Not the best if you want to 'picture' moving objects, kids or sports.  5. Is very basic camera, not many/any features at all.It works but I don't like it.

I am comparing it to my previous Kodak point and shoot Easyshare 3.2 MP digital that was replaced. That camera didn't have the fancy claims to 6 MP or video, but it was always reliable. The batteries in the Kodak never stop performing when you most needed your camera. I dropped it numerous times and it survived without a flaw. It was really simple to use and transfer photos to any computer. And it took great photos without blurring the subject.The Sony DSC-S500 I was given as a gift to upgrade my photography has been nothing short of aggravating. Fully charged Energizer NiMH batteries only last an hour or two. If you use it skiing or anywhere its colder than 50 degrees F, prepare for total uselessness. This camera HATES cold weather! The video is extremely grainy and it takes a very considererable effort to initialize the video function to begin with.Get a tripod too because this camera can't handle even the steadiest hand. Just pressing the button with cause your shots to be blurry unless you balance it on something solid. The back display is small and hard to see. Shooting at night becomes a guessing game of point it that way and shoot.For a Sony product, this is not the camera to buy unless you plan to shoot in ideal conditions and have a tripod. If I didn't get this as a gift, I would have sold it or returned it already. I already had Sony evaluate its condition for defects and it came back negative. This only means Sony found its low quality to be satisfactory for this model.I am just one opinion.

I have an older (bigger, bulkier) Sony digital camera (DSC-S85, 4.0 Megapixels), and I assumed this camera would incorporate the great quality pictures, but not all the features as the older model.  In the end I did not like the quality of the pictures or video.  I took the same shots with my old camera and the S500 and the quality was just not there. I read the less-than-helpful user guide many times to make sure I was not missing something, but to no avail.  The older camera does have the Carl Zeiss lens and this one does not, so that may be part of the issue.I use the video capability on my old camera quite a bit. (We live in a different part of the country than the rest of my family and it's great for sharing little video clips of the kids.)  The sound quality on this camera is totally unacceptable (lots of static), as another review here on Amazon.com pointed out.After buying a memory card and the rechargable batteries, you might be better off moving up to the next price point in cameras.

Before I made decision, I read the reviews in Amazon, and it seems that DSC S500 got very good reviews, though some complaints. Last week, when CompUSA put it on promotion, I rushed to grab one. However, it turned out to be a very dissappointed experience this time. 1). the picture taken with this camerais blurred and dark, much lower quality than even the picture I taken with my old S40; 2). different from DSC S40, it is really a battery eater; 3). and also more difficult to use.In the end, I decided to return it, and bought a higher DSC W50 (see my seperated review.

At first I was enthralled, though I thought I was really bad at it because most of my pictures would always come out blurry.Nope, turns out it's mostly the camera. If you want one for making simple videos or taking pictures of your friends and family posing in good light, then this camera may be the one for you. However, if you're like me and want to take more artistic photos, look elsewhere because this camera will majorly discourage you from persuing the art.The flash is extremely bright, but that can be turned off. What you see in the screen when you're getting ready for the shot isn't want you'll get when you preview it later, when suddenly it's grainier and off-color. The macro is fine if you want the object you're taking an extreme closeup of to be blurry and the background in focus, as opposed to the other way around which is impossible with this camera. Don't even think of taking night shots.This guy is also rather delecate. A couple of months into owning it, it took a small bump and broke the screen. Hooray warranty! However, while sitting in my empty purse a few months later, a small part of the battery compartment lid chipped making me sometimes have to hold it down just so with my thumb. And now for no reason one of the lens covers sticks a little meaning that I have to risk touching the lens in order to move the cover out of the way. I won't even get started with how the user manual didn't mention that there's an option for black and white and sepia photos, or that it takes a few seconds for the camera to take a picture after you push the button.All in all, a good camera if you're in good lighting, have a steady hand or a tripod, and everything is absolutely still and not too close or too far.

Meadors \"J Meadors\"", "ReviewID": "R39SA8VL2PAK2N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For about $150 you can't expect too much from a digital camera... and the Sony S500 certainly meets those expectations.  I bought this camera because at the time it was one of the only sub-$200 cameras with a larger LCD display (2.4\").  I wasn't expecting such low picture quality however--particularly in low light applications.  In most applications, both day and night, you have to hold the camera very still to avoid blur... but in even slightly low level light it is almost impossible to get a clear image without setting the camera down or using a tripod.  However, if you do that, the photos are fairly decent.Other good features is the AA batteries instead of proprietary rechargables that a lot of manufacturers are using... when you're out taking pics all day and your battery dies, it's nice to be able to just pop in some AAs and keep going--vs. having to either plug back in to recharge or have to buy a $20-30 2nd battery from Sony.The zoom also kind of sucks on this camera.  If you zoom at all--even if you are still in the optical range (vs. the digital), the picture quality really plummets and gets very grainy very fast.Color balance seems to also be an issue with this camera--again especially in low light levels.  I find myself spending a LOT of time correcting and tweaking the colors, brightness, and contrast on my pics with this camera... which ultimately screws up the image quality (since the adjustments are done post photo and digitally).Bottom line, if you are just looking for a cheap, basic point and shoot to keep handy for miscellaneous but not overly complicated or technical shots--and quality is not an big issue--this camera will suffice.  If you are going on vacation and value your images--or need higher quality images--go with something like a canon digital elph... a little more money but a much higher image quality...", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good for an ameture", "Author": "ulcia \"ulcia\"", "ReviewID": "R2OV0RAU06MP63", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I loved the camera when i got it in the mail and everything was great.

This one is a decent entry level camera considering its age. Even though the resolution of cameras has almost doubled in the five years its been out it still preforms well. Short of an image stabilization feature this camera douse what you would expect a consumer level camera to do. It takes crisp photos and stores them fast to memory.One of the largest down sides, other than the initial retail price, is its on board and expansion memory. The on board memory is so small its only practical use is as a shelf demo model while its expansion memory uses the Sony standard propitiatory Memory Stick ProDuo cards. The transfer rate of images to disk is very fast; it's something that a casual photographer might not necessarily be willing to pay for. The cards themselves are also expensive for any decent volume of storage. The only reason I invested in this camera in the first place was because I had other Sony equipment that used the same media that I could take advantage of.One thing to mention now is the support for the camera as it gets older, when it was released windows XP was the standard OS that it was expected to interact with and since then not only has the digital age gone threw two versions but we have also upgraded to 64bit. I'm not sure what kind of difference it makes but in the simplest way to put it, the camera does not work well with modern copies of windows for very long.In my experience the longer you have had windows 7 installed the more likely the drivers are to stop working correctly. After doing research on Google I discovered that its not just an issue with my machine. Though it might be possible to restore support by reinstalling your OS a much easier solution would to just get a USB card reader and save yourself the hassle.Another downside to the camera is that there aren't many accessories for it. As an entry level camera it has the fixtures for a tripod mount but that's about it. Official Sony accessories are limited to a soft carry bag. There is a rubber flap near the battery compartment for a battery cell that could be charged without removing it from the camera however that cell does not exist near as I can find.Bottom line; its a good camera, if the price is rite. I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone who doesn't own another device that uses the same media if only to use to transfer from when you discover that connecting it threw USB doesn't work. If your going to do any serious work or plan on getting something with a long life rechargeable batter, don't get this model.If your willing to work around its quarks it is an excellent camera even as old as it is!

First time it broke it would TRY to take pictures but they would show up black on the screen, then it just DIED. Next time I had the hot/cold problem that's been reported on earlier camera's of this model. Mine is an older version,(bought feb 2006 on amazon!) and I still have these problems. The problem I'm having now is shadow's or 3D effects taken on EVERY picture. With sun, with out sun, with flash, with out flash, in a light room, in a dark room, its a [...] piece of junk.

Maestas \"anglkisses\"", "ReviewID": "R152N1FT0WKZXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had a cybershot previously that we had stolen and when looking into buying another camera we looked at all our options.  We had a great experience with our previous one but wanted to upgrade so we went with this one after quite a bit of research.  I love the large screen and that the picture options are located on top of the camera as opposed to having to go through the menu.  I don't mind that it doesn't have a viewfinder, since I never used it on my last one anyway.  I actually read the manual to learn how to use the other features this time so I'm enjoying practicing different types of shots.  With my previous one there was some delay between pushing the button and it taking the picture, this was for focusing.  This one doesn't require that time, BUT you HAVE to allow it to focus to keep your pictures from being blurry.  You just push the button half-way down and wait for the signal on the screen to stop blinking, then take the picture.  Luckily I discovered this while practicing before taking \"real\" pictures.  It would be nice if that was a little faster but with practice you get used to it.  Once you do that the pictures are fabulous.  I would highly recommend buying some kind of case to protect the screen since it doesn't come with any kind of cover, and a memory stick- it uses the duo-internal memory only holds 8 pictures.  I guess battery life depends on the user.  We just use it for taking pics of the kids and holidays and things so we only go through about 2 regular alkalines every few months, so we don't need the upgraded ones.  I'm sure if you used the camera more often they might be more cost-effective.", "Date": "December 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - terrible sound on the video", "Author": "Natalie Smith", "ReviewID": "R1OF2FG6722E63", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the camera itself is great, it takes amazing photographs and the LCD screen is big and bright (something my last camera was lacking).
