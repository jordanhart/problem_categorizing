Regular game cameras do a way better job, especially for the price.  The audio didn't work on my unit and only gave white noise. I need a clandestine camera that works as well as a game camera, but all my game cameras are too obvious and get stolen.  It also seems to have alot of false hits.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK camera if camera theft is the issue, otherwise 1st look at a cheaper priced camera.", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R1CWA4GJTX29BC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would recommend this over a trail camera or outdoor surveillance camera if there is a threat of it being recognized and stolen.  There are 2 ways of setting this up: dip switches or menu. I haven't tried the menu option in depth but I've tried the dip switch option. The recordings did not span the length of a year.  The last time that I tried it, there were 3 months of video on the 16gb card after I let it sit for 4 1/2 months.  I hooked it up to be recharged and when I went to the menu it stated that the battery was close to 100%.  I touched the battery capacity indicator and it was 1 mark away from being full, so I don't know what happened to the missing 1 1/2 months.  I set it up for 15 second clips with normal quality and detection at Low. The menu has more options than the dip switch option. For the dip switches, all you have to do is set the switches and turn the power on and it will record in a few seconds.  The lag time is so wide between videos that fast movement may only be detected in 1 shot before the subject is gone.  Also, there were videos shot of near darkness but there was nothing recognizable in the video.  Night videos with no light are useless to the point where I just deleted them when I saw the thumbnail.  Most of the videos showed no human or animal in them. I put this rock on top of a brick at the end of a carport and was able to record vehicles like the garbage truck that had stopped and my neighbor walking in the yard. With sensitivity on low and image quality of normal, I could make out all of this without problems.  There is a delay between the sensor picking up movement and recording it. The manual explains how to set it up and is decent.  If camera theft isn't the issue, try a cheaper trail camera or surveillance camera. I'm using this due to how covert it us but I'm looking elsewhere for another type of camera.. Only someone who looks very close may notice it to be fake. The other advantage it has is the single rechargeable battery vice paying for 4 or 8 or 12 alkaline or lithium batteries. It comes with an audio/video cable and a remote control.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$649.00", "Features": "Ultra-long battery life - processor only operates when sensor is tripped\nWeather resistant - can be placed almost anywhere outside\nConnects easily to your computer with a USB port", "Name": "XtremeLife Rock Hidden camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-0qerbBkL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0047QL4DU"}}
