As all Fuji cameras (and I had few) it is very user friendly. The quality of photos and movies is second to none and you can take clips of HD and great photos especially with the automatic mode set.There were however 3 very disappointing points which we did not expected and are important to highlight:1. Most important - batteries. The camera has a unique battery that runs empty in minutes (even when GPS location search is permanently off. It would be easier if the camera simply was using AA batteries.2. GPS location - when on the result is just a sheet with latitudes and longitudes and we are still trying to figure out how to tag the photos with real places names.3. Clips - while zooming in/out while recording a clip/movie there are two problems: loosing focus and hearing the zoom action in the movie.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Scott K. \"Sk\"", "ReviewID": "RSWI8KXMFY28U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just moved to Colorado and this is the first camera I have purchased.I chose it because I will be doing a lot of outdoor activities and this one seemed to have all the functions I would need to be satisfied.First test was taking it on a 3 day ski trip with my friends and it performed beautifully.  I was taking pictures and videos on and off for about 8 hrs each day.  The battery ran out the first day, but only towards the very end of the day after a lot of video and pictures being taken.  I would recommend bringing an extra battery just in case, I did and it worked out great.I was in 20 degree weather the whole time and they say the batteries do worse in cold weather, so I can only imagine how they will perform in optimum conditions.The pictures and videos came out great...only problem with uploading the videos was the sound would not transfer over, but I believe it has something to do with a codec on Divx and will be fixed soon.I crashed pretty hard while taking video with the camera and there wasn't even a scratch on it.  It looks like brand new after 3 hard days on the mountain and I would definitely recommend this camera for someone looking for a solid piece of equipment.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "I really Like this Camera", "Author": "Buy Once Cry Once", "ReviewID": "RJOREP4YDXZIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this on my wishlist and received it as a gift. I looked at other outdoor cameras and based on reviews didn't see why I would want others at double the price (Pentax)when reviewers had the same gripes  and complaints. Those complaints were mostly about water submersion issues, which i tested at home. I ran the camera under a faucet and let it dry. The camera still works. Hopefully that means I will have no issues.I chose the orange color to make it easy to find and stand out from the typical black. I love the color, it looks like a search and rescue orange and fits the outdoor look.The body has a nice metal front, solid rubber coating for grip, and is larger than the last model. I like the size since I get clumsy with electronics and like a bigger size. Picture quality so far has been very nice, crisp and clear. The settings are relatively simple though I have not tried them all.One added feature on this model is the GPS locator. It will stamp each picture with a GPS coordinate, for example if you are on a road trip and not completely sure where you are. Doesn't sound like much, but when you download hundreds or thousands of pics from a trip i bet you don't remember where every picture was taken. I could also see some use if you were to get lost; maybe you don't know where you are, take a picture and look at its grid coordinates, you could tell help those coordinates. Doubtful the feature will get used much but its there should i need it.Just to compare to the last model, someone I know has it. The last model was smaller, lacked the GPS, and seemed more prone to water damage. Apparently, there is a fine not able to see coat of plastic over the camera which seals it. In salt water, and from any kind of detergents or cleaning products, that coating dissolves making the camera no longer water proof. Well you don't know this until it happens, and Fuji will refuse the warranty. So in other words don't expect Fuji to back the warranty. Be very careful with your camera, and try to let it dry completely before opening the battery/memory compartment. I think i will begin carrying a small terry towel which is super absorbent to wipe the camera with after any water use.So far I love the camera and hope it lasts for years.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is not a waterproof camera", "Author": "janita", "ReviewID": "R2ACM0BS8T3X5E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I went to the river and big disapoointment: as soon I took a picture under the water (just about 5 inches under it) it stopped working and a couple hours later there was moist into the screen.

Additionally, the picture quality is acceptable. However, it has two major short-comings. First, the camera can be turned on accidentally far too easily (when in a pocket). When I'm on a long mountain climbing trip and battery life is carefully planned, I can't have the camera randomly turning on because it got jostled slightly. Second, it can't be charged via USB. In other words, you either have to have an AC outlet or spare batteries. You can't rely on bring a larger battery to charge the electrical devices; and you can't rely on a solar panel (again, without an AC converter).In summary: for an every-day camera, it's perfectly fine.

I received it back in mid March and never thought to test it's waterproof capabilities because friends of mine have similar models and rave about their cameras.  Well I'm here on vacation now, the sole purpose of buying the camera, and on it's maiden voyage into the ocean it didn't stay waterproofed and never worked.  My friends here with me also have a similar model and pointed out the battery/memory card compartment on mine closes very easily while theirs takes some extra effort to close.  So their theory is the gasket on mine was never good enough.  The salt water got into it so badly that it won't do anything now.  I don't know yet if it ruined the memory card I also bought through Amazon but that's going to upset me more if it doesn't work.  So here I am...on my biggest vacation of the year...with no camera, let alone a waterproof one that was supposed to capture all my most unique adventures.  My heart is breaking.  Not one underwater shot.How to return this?  Well I bought this on 3/15/12 and the first Amazon message I run into when clicking the button to return it is that my return window expired on 4/17/12.  Wow...thanks for the second low blow since today is 5/5/12.  I'm going to keep the faith that when I get home I will find a way to return or exchange this item to make an attempt at reversing the damage done.  This is the second electronics item I have bought through Amazon that has failed me.  If I cannot get my money back, or receive a camera that is waterproof, I will never buy another electronic item through Amazon again.So the lesson learned here is to test the waterproofing as soon as you get this, if you choose to buy this camera for water-resistant adventures.

I am not biased at Fuji, but I'm pissed off because mother's day was ruined.I purchased The Fujifilm Finepix XP30, because in all the reviews it showed it to be a good camera for the price and its capabilities.  This camera was my fiance's mother's day present... (Which incidentally its TODAY).We had been playing with the camera and it was working great, I found the GPS Utility to be rather annoying as it took close to 1minute and sometimes more,  to find the GPS satellite everytime we turned on the camera...  Even in open areas OUTSIDE.  My 7yrs old GPS is faster than that.The battery like many others have pointed out lasts close to nothing when you have the GPS always on feature, and even with it off, it doesnt last a lot.Today at some point, our daughter got her feet on the pool and I wanted to show off the camera underwater.  I put the camera around 6 inches under the surface when I saw bubbles come from the black hump where the gps antenna is... it was not a train of bubbles either, but enough to concern you a bit, I  snapped photo of her feet underwater and took it out, then showed it to my fiance, up til then the camera was working great.I switched the Always ON of the GPS, to see if it minimized the connection setting every time we turned on the camera, and turned it off.  We got home and when I went to turn it on, I get greeted by a white screen and then 10s later it turned off.  The screen started getting this weird off-screen glare (you can see it here: [...]) I thought maybe the battery ran out, but then I put it, to charge and gave it a good charge until the light was green and I tried again to turn it on.  It was as if the camera got possessed. It starting flashing the screen, white and with scan lines... the menu button didnt work, a total mess.  I opened the battery compartment and I checked the battery bay and the camera was wet, but when I took the memory card out, that is when we saw the camera was not slightly wet, but it had globs of water.I got the SD card out and its wet.  The camera did take water and its not supposed to... I remember al the lids where shut tight, but somehow it got wet.  I'ts not that it got wet because I dived 20feet either... The camera was merely 6 inches at the most under water.Aside from it not working as advertised, the delivery got thwarted because amazon shipped with UPS, which is like the Incompetents of the carrier and shipping industry.  We live in Dallas, and the camera per the tracking, arrived here, then somehow it shipped itself to Ontario California, and no one in amazon or UPS knew why.  So I ordered through prime and instead of it arriving two days as most of my stuff arrives it took a week.So Fuji with the XP30 didnt build a Waterproof Camera, they built a camera that boasts it being water, shock, snow and dust proof, but it really cant take 6 inches of depth.Now I have to figure if Amazon is going to make the return or if I have to deal with Fujifilm for it...I am giving the camera an overall rating of 1 star, because it turned on.  But the fact that it got water in  just took away the rest of the stars, I could give it a 2 star rating but, the GPS taking 2hrs to boot in took away that star as well.Amazon's ratings never fail, I should have listened when some people  complained about the quality of this camera.... :(", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "I want a new one :(", "Author": "vero_nitrox", "ReviewID": "R3AQCTL66BLF0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera was excellent, but hard a week stopped working because the cover was closed but not with the lock and we submerged, does not work more.The photos were very good, the videos were fine.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect purchase for our cruise!", "Author": "Rusty", "ReviewID": "RSPXNFT4A615U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a normal digital camera but bought this one so I would be OK with it getting wet. I don't think I even used my regular camera the entire time. I strapped this camera to my wrist and went snorkeling, diving, swam with dolphins and even sting rays. All of the other people were asking about the camera getting wet, but I assured them that it was fine. Each night I uploaded the pics from the camera (just in case I lost it, I would have the pics taken so far on my laptop.) The pictures taken out of the water were just as good if not better than my regular digital camera, but the pictures taken underwater were amazing. I will post a couple of them to show the camera's quality.When I purchased this, it came with a carrying case, tripod, 2GB memory card, memory card USB adapter, battery charger, and little 6\" tripod. Everything was included, and I never even had to buy a better memory. 2GB is plenty for a seven day cruise.I really wanted the blue colored camera, and I think I paid a little extra for it, but I have no regrets. This has become our primary camera to bring everywhere (when we remember) because it is so durable and its OK if we drop in in water (or more likely, spill beer on it).Oh, I also recorded a movie of my fianc3 swimming with a dolphin and it came out just as good as the pictures.This camera says that it was refurbished but I cannot tell.

Read all instructions is my best advice. I had no issues at all.I loved this camera so much, I bought another as soon as I got home from my vacation!

On my first usage in a river rafting event, I already see the problems with this camera:1) I am experienced with Camera and camcorders, I know how to hold them properly. But the lens head is placed in a very awkward place, your fingers will easily cover part of the lens head. So, don't be surprised to see your fingers in the final photos and video clips. It's almost for sure that you will not get photos or videos of yourself. Because other people may not be able to hold this camera properly to take yours.2) Hard to fine tune the zoom speed. Not convenient, but I can live with that.3) The camera won't focus while zooming (it will focus after zooming stops). This is a typical issue with non-DSLR camera in video mode. I saw the same thing in Panasonic camera also. Not a big issue to me.4) This is the biggest flaw, the audio is not in sync with the video. I have to turn off the audio from the video clips, and add background music when producing the final movie for the rafting trip. Even my simple Flip video camera handle this better than this Fuji camera.5) The video quality is no way to compare with regular HD camcorder. The image is kind of grainy, even at 1pm strong sunshine with good light. Again, I can accept this since I am in a condition (around water) where normal camcorder can not be used.6) Indoor photo quality is no way to compare with my 5-year-old 5MP Panasonic camera.But this is OK to me since I am in a condition (around water) where my normal camera can not be used.If this is the only camera you want to have, I won't recommend this. However, if your intend is \"ONLY\" to take photos, videos in conditions where your normal gears can not, then I think this Fuju XP20 is acceptable....if you don't mind the out-of-sync audio problem.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible!

I definitely do not recommend this camera to anyone. It was so dissapointing that I lost out on so many pictures I wanted to take of swimming with the dolphins and more.
