I've had several digital cameras before this that were around $100. For only $160 this camera blows them away. There are so many great things about it. The battery is a long lasting rechargeable that beats 2 AA rechargeable any day. It's very compact and great for keeping in your pocket. It has a very attractive polished steal surface that looks even better in person than in the picture. I love the sliding lens cover, it keeps your lens safe, looks great when closed, and it automatically turns the camera on/off so you can save battery in between pictures. It turns on very fast, you can turn it on and take a picture in just 3 or 4 seconds. The intelligent auto adjust is by far my favorite feature. You can truly see the difference in a photo taken with or without it. The main reason I bought it was because I am a college intern at Disney World and I'm taking lots of pictures. Compared to my old camera I got just a year ago, the night pictures are just amazing. They look as good as if you had taken them in the daylight. Bright signs at Downtown Disney are dimmed while enhancing the dark surroundings perfectly every time. It also recognized moving subjects and adjust the ISO speed automatically. It also has face and smile detection. You can even set a camera to only take a picture when everyone is smiling, which is useful when in situations where you'd normally use a timer. The 4x optical zoom takes place within the lens housing so no lens is sticking out of the front. By the way, in my opinion, 4x optical zoom is plenty for a hand held camera like this because when just holding in your hand, anything over 4x just gets a little shaky though the camera does recognize shakiness and speeds up the shot for it. I know I went on and on but I just wanted to tell how great a camera this is for the value and that all of the things is says on the product page are quite true and not really making mountains out of mole hills like some things do.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "gaggles64", "ReviewID": "R296B5BY35DIDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product-came in box with all accessories needed for the camera to operate.

I was going to get a nikon then I started reading all the reviews. In the end, all reviews led me to this camera, so I decided to go for it. Glad that I did, the pictures are stunning, and never blurry. Lots of settings for intermediate picture takers.  Our favorite is the panorama shots. We live at the beach so its nice to get the full view.And its very sturdy (for those clumsy people like myself)Hands down the best little camera I have ever had.Great camera for the price.The only con is that it didnt come with a case.....

I got it right before Thanksgiving and used it while my family (lots of kids) were at our house for the holiday.  HD Video was good, but the camera made HORRIBLE pictures in low light, inside the house. I expect ANY modern camera to take good pics outside, and this one did, but I expected more from this big time Sony camera, and it just didn't deliver.  I ended up returning and got my money back, and I have haven't bought a new one yet (still using my 4 yr old Cybershot)", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "I am disappointed with this product from Sony, or DSC-T90 vs. DSC-T99.", "Author": "DMV", "ReviewID": "RT42GSZ04W3HG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had very positive experience with another point-and-shoot camera from Sony, DSC-T90, so far. That's why I decided to buy somewhat similar for my mother. I have checked Sony's online store and found out this product, DSC-T99. I assumed this is a continuation of the great product line, more superior model as compared to my old DSC-T90. Based on the pictures and characteristics listed on vendor's website, camera definitely looked great. I have checked Amazon prices and was amazed even more - you can get it for some $150! So I bought it...The camera arrived in a cool package but I cannot tell you how disappointed I was when I opened that fancy package and checked out the product. I assure you, it has nothing in common with DSC-T90:1) First off, it is made from cheap plastic - totally different impression vs. DSC-T90 while you are holding it (yes it is lighter but I see absolutely no pros in that).2) But cheap feel is not the major problem. The major one is camera's interface: it is very slow and unresponsive... folks at Sony added some stupid drag-n-drop features but took away half of the useful features that are available in DSC-T90! The optics is also different: quality of pictures made by DSC-T99 is considerably lower than by DSC-T90.3) And the last thing I want to mention is how the control buttons are designed. It feels like designers wanted to hide them from you - it is next to impossible to locate the buttons without looking at them.The bottom line of my review is that you should beware of this product's quality and think twice before buying a product nicely packaged by Sony's marketing but priced almost twice lower than DSC-T90 which has been around for a while. On a surface it may seem that these products are similar but this is absolutely not the case. I am returning DSC-T99 to the store, and spending extra $100 to buy DSC-T90.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unresponsive.", "Author": "spr \"spr\"", "ReviewID": "R29V1RSGVW97VD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My primary complaint about this camera is that I was expecting an 'upgrade' as I was replacing our older Sony 8.1 megapixel T100 (that has image stabilization failure so the camera vibrates... a common problem with them I have found)This camera isnt 1/2 what the T100 is.  Its is almost totally unresponsive, the touch screen is tedious to use - often close to nonfunctional, manual control is just about non-existent besides exposure.  Shutter delay/lag is laughably long, flash control is limited (eg: no fill flash option or +/- stop adjustment) even previewing images is annoying and difficult.  The zoom control is slow to respond and tends to 'smart zoom' either too far in or too far out no matter what the settings are onto what it thinks is the intended subject. 'Burst' mode is totally useless and can just about manage a bit more than 1 frame per second...sortof.  The 'sweep panorama' generates blurry, low quality images - you are much better off stitching your own together and I will probably only use it if I get lazy.  Navigating menu options while shooting is again - slow.The only good things I can say about this camera is that has a fairly wide angle lens on it, battery endurance was moderately good, it is slim/small/light, and in good lighting and set to full auto, it takes OK pictures - I suppose same as any point and shoot 14 megapixel camera.... anything demanding or tricky, and this camera is almost - but not quite - a waste of time.As a new user to this camera I may warm up to it a bit after I learn to live (or work with) its many weaknesses - but first impresions after shooting about 300 images on a recent shoirt trip is that the computing power of this camera is a inadequate to process the considerable automatic features, 'scene selections' and touch screen interface.  Compared to the T100, this has more features but is less usable in practice - I would say temper your expectations if you are a semi-serious shooter.  If you are someone who will leave it on 'automatic' forever - then it may work better for you. Maybe.*** Update, several months later ***  This camera is worse than even I thought - in low light and even sunny days where glare is a problem - this camera is about non-functional.  In any outdoors high contrast situation... even with the sun at your back - the camera produces vertical streaks/lines on the images - even with the sun at your back or from the side.  This is not a 'glare' problem... this is nonfunctional image processing.  After returning to Sony for repair (this is a known issue and no, a 'reset' will not correct it), I expect I will be shelving it and buying something else - it is a total write-off.

The 3rd one was an SD200 that held up very well until the lcd was accidentally cracked.Compared to the Canon cameras the photos captured from the Sony T99 are not nearly as good with flatter colors and more image noise. The lack of crisp sharpness and detail are very obvious when zooming into the photos which are good only up to 5x7 prints max.The greatest advantage of the T99 is the size, it is a camera that can be carried all the time unlike the majority of other cameras. I have a Canon SLR that takes awesome photos though I will not lug that thing around with me for all family outings, therefore I will capture moments with decent quality on the T99 that I would have totally missed with my other cameras.Capturing a beautiful scene or a smile on a child's face with the T99 is better than no photo from a great camera left at home or in the car.I've never used a camera that was so much fun to operate as the T99, the very large touch screen works great and is intuitive. It has face detection that will take a photo when someone smiles, an amazing panorama mode that is simple to use, and it takes very good HD videos.This is a great take along camera that will capture shots and videos that other cameras will definitely miss.PROS:+ Small size with an internal Carl Zeiss zoom lens and great build quality.+ Quick start up and responsive.+ Great feature set and touch screen.+ Sony PMB photo organizer software is terrific!+ Fun to use.CONS:- Only fair photo quality, this is a moments capturer and not a photographer's camera.- The small size makes camera hard to hold and the sleek design makes the buttons a little difficult to use.- Lens location allows finger to get in the way often.- Battery life is not very good.- Takes practice to get the best results out of this camera.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$159.99", "Features": "Rechargeable Battery (NP-BN1)\nBattery Charger\nWrist Strap\nPaint Pen\nMulti Connector Cable", "Name": "Sony T Series DSC-T99 14.1 Megapixel DSC Camera with Super HAD CCD Image Sensor (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dctNNePwL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003W4B7J4"}}
