{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Resurrect your manual focus lenses", "Author": "Rico", "ReviewID": "R1OKXYJ573T6SR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have manual focus lenses from your SLR days, this is currently the best deal on a camera body to bring those lenses back to life. There are inexpensive adapters for using lots of SLR lens types, and some old rangefinder lens types, with Micro Four Thirds cameras such as this one. With your old lens mounted, just set the camera mode to A for aperture priority, set the aperture on the lens to your desired f-stop, and the camera will automatically adjust the shutter and ISO for a good exposure. Manually focusing your lens is made easier because the viewfinder can magnify the subject you're focusing on.Moreover, the camera has in-body image stabilization, so the sensor compensates for camera shake. You just choose your lens's focal length from a menu, and the camera will permit slower shutter speeds without blur. Other camera lines put their image stabilization in their lenses, but the Olympus PENs have it in the body, so it can be used with any lens you mount on the camera.The camera has a full range of other digital features, and it produces images of excellent quality.Note that the Micro Four Thirds sensor, while several times the size of the sensor found in point-and-shoot digital cameras, is half the size of a frame of 35mm film. Consequently, any lens on an MFT camera will have the same angle of view as a lens with twice the focal length on a 35mm film camera. For example, a 50mm lens on an MFT camera will give the angle of view that a 100mm lens would give on a 35mm film camera.I should add that the lenses Olympus makes for its PEN cameras are excellent. The combination of the 14-42mm and 40-150mm zooms would cover a range equal to 28-300mm on a 35mm film camera, and with crisp autofocus and full autoexposure. I actually have both those lenses, and they're great. But I'm also enjoying again the great lenses I had for my old SLR, which had been sitting on a shelf since the last millennium. Film is still dead, but good lenses can live again.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Deal of the century", "Author": "Todd CK", "ReviewID": "R3GQQ5TR6OWF0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "-This is the steal of the century. Don't pass up the little camera.I was originally looking to spend about $1500 for a DSLR. I've had film SLR's and a nice DSLR before. But they were always to bulky and heavy. That always bothered me. So I rarely lugged them around as much as I would have liked. A lot of missed opportunities. Kind of pointless if the camera is not there for the shot. I ended up getting some of my best shots with my little point and shoot. Because it was always there. But the quality of the shot took a hit. And I didn't have the control over the shot I really desired. I sold my last DSLR a long time ago because of the size and weight. And did without. But I always had a longing for better quality photos.I narrowed it down to what I wanted. But I just couldn't pull the trigger. It was a lot of money for that DSLR. Although a little smaller now and lighter I just knew it wasn't going to be enough. I worried it would end up sitting at home like the rest.Then I saw this little camera by chance. The OLYMPUS E-PL1. I had heard a little about this micro four thirds format. Did some more reading. Read all the great reviews and happy photographers. Read all about the converts that left behind their DSLR camera's for the smaller format.I was still skeptical. But I thought wow what do I have to lose for $150?? Is it really only $150 that can't be right! Well I'll give it a try and I'll just use it temporarily until I pull the trigger on a 'real' camera.Well let me tell you. After some time with it, this is as real as they come. What an amazing little camera. The build quality is outstanding. Feels very solid. There is nothing cheap feeling about it at all. I was worried about the controls but they are very intuitive and easy to change and adjust. The JPG's are fantastic. I've heard about the Olympus colors and it's all true. And you get RAW also for those times you want to be more discriminating.It starts up much faster than my point and shoot. It's just ready to go for that unexpected shot. The size is fantastic. I can bring it anywhere. It's got all the control I could ask for. And full manual when I need it.I bought it with the 20mm 1.7 pancake lens. If you get one lens get that lens. It's an incredible match for this camera. And the short size of it keeps everything really compact.I have to say I'm so happy with this camera and this micro four thirds format that I have no intentions of ever going to DSLR again. I don't even feel the need to buy a more expensive camera. I love this thing. When I'm not shooting I like to just hold it and start it up sometimes. It just feels great to hold.Don't let the price fool you. This is not a cheap camera or a 'beginners' camera. This is top notch quality. You really can't go wrong with this purchase. Before you consider anything else give this camera a try, you won't regret it.*update*After using this camera for some time here are some more thoughts:The focus is terribly slow. And really bad in low light. If it can't get a focus it won't let you take the picture.The noise at higher ISO degrades pretty fast.Would be nice to have some manual dials for quicker adjustmentsI've been shooting video with it now. Wish it was 1080p. The video is always to high of contrast. Wish it was more neutral. But it still looks great though.Still love the camera. Amazing deal for what you get.

It arrived in a Olympus refurb box, with all the accessories as new. The body is perfect, not a mark on it. I also ordered the 14-42mm auto focus Micro 4/3 lens to go with it. I am not quite as happy with the lens. It takes great photos outdoors in bright sunlight, but indoors, or in low light, it is hit or miss at best. However, it is very fast to focus (be sure to upgrade the firmware to 1.1). The lens is still worth having around for vacation/family type photos, and for video.What really makes this camera great is the ability to use inexpensive legacy, manual focus lenses, with a very inexpensive aftermarket adapter. I use Olympus Zuiko OM lenses with an adapter, and my 50MM F1.8 is on the camera most of the time. The results with this lens are impressive, although obviously using manual focus is not ideal in situations when there is limited time to take a shot.My only gripe with this camera is the poor placement of the video button.

I also bought Fotodiox M42 to micro 4/3 adapter together with the camera. I have a Pentax *ist DS SLR but the M42-to-Pentax K adapter I have is one of my least favorite photographic accessories. It is just a very thin ring that is difficult to put on my Pentax body. It also has issues with certain lenses. So I decided to try this camera. For $150 this is a great deal.The camera is built very well. No creaks or flimsy plastic parts here except for the HDMI/USB connector cover. The control layout is closer to a point and shoot with lots of buttons. However, this does not get in the way of photography. The button feel is good. I especially like the mode button. The feel of the shutter button is a little weak. I would prefer better separation between half press and full press. I assigned custom white balance function to Fn button and RAW+JPEG function to video record button. Since I exclusively use manual focus lenses, I set the focus mode to MF. This brings out a very useful feature in that pressing the zoom button magnifies a small portion of the live view image 7x to 14x for critical focusing. What is more is that you can move the focus area with the first press of the zoom button using directional buttons. I can use my lenses in P or M mode. In P mode, you need to select the auto ISO mode. Camera tries to set a shutter speed of approximately 2x of focal length and adjusts ISO to get a good exposure. Auto ISO range is selectable and by default goes from 200 to 1600. Since camera trusts that you are focusing the lens properly, there is almost no shutter lag when taking a picture. The shake reduction works well as long as you remember to enter the focal length of the lens you are using in the IS menu. Controls respond quickly. The menu system is not the most intuitive but you quickly get the hang of it. There are funny short hand notations such as \"Custom WB NG\" that appears when custom white balance adjustment is no good. Built-in flash is small but works surprisingly well with manual focus lenses (a surprise since my *ist DS always fires built-in flash at full power with M42 lenses often resulting in over-exposed images). Playback review is quick but not as easy as my *ist DS. The zoom magnification is a button that you repeatedly press. I would much prefer a ring for magnification. Also repeatedly pressing the INFO button results in different informational screens in playback mode. One screen is totally useless with file number and a bunch of garbage displayed. Oddly you cannot turn off this display even though you can customize the rest.M42 lenses: My Pentax SMC Takumar 50mm f1.4 works beautifully on this camera. When mounted, the aperture ring and the distance scale is slightly off to the right but this is an issue with the Fotodiox adapter. I uploaded some pictures if you want to take a look at them. The lens operates in stop down mode. I enabled \"Live View Boost\" in custom menu so the camera tries to deal with the lower light reaching the sensor at smaller apertures by brightening the live view. This results in a very noisy live view at f8.0 or smaller but is totally fine with me. Some lenses such as Mamiya Sekor 50mm f1.4 and Fujica 55mm f1.8 have indents on the outer periphery of the lens mount that prevents them seating firmly to the adapter. As a result you lose infinity focus. So I'll file away these indents in the future. Some bigger lenses, such as my Fujinon EBC 135mm f2.8 makes the overall setup very top heavy. I also tried a Vivitar 19mm f3.8 and Lentar 35mm f3.5 with good results. The movie mode is OK with these lenses except that when you change the aperture while filming camera you here loud clicks in playback. There is also a lot of ambient noise recorded. The Lentar 35mm I mentioned above is especially interesting for movies since it has a non-click smooth turning aperture ring that makes no noise at all.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Buy Camera", "Author": "K. farmer \"Sound Man\"", "ReviewID": "R1AP244G7VJ86Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At the going price of 150, this is the best buy in DLSR photography.

This was purchased a few weeks before she was born, and my first photos of her were taken with it. The reason I bought this specific camera was singular: the price. The price of this camera is quite a steal. It is a little slow in the UI and menus, it doesn't have great high ISO noise performance, but when paired with some of the incredible Micro Four Thirds glass, those things cease to matter.The Good: * Has a full manual mode as well as aperture priority, shutter priority, and program assist. The rest of the dial is just fluff and I almost never use it. * Can record 720p, 30fps movies. The video quality is fine, and not camcorder quality, but if you use a dreamy lens no one will notice those shortcomings. * Built in flash can be pulled back and held in place to bounce it off of the ceiling. This is a good way to get some soft light in a pinch. * Allows you to zoom in on a portion of the image to focus manually. * Supports simultaneous auto and manual focus. You can half press to lock exposure and auto focus, then tweak the manual focus on the lens as the zoom focus mode automatically pops up so you can see the focus close up. * Built in image stabilization that works with any lens (sensor shift).The Bad: * The 12 MP sensor might feel a bit small if you like cropping in your favorite editor. * High ISO performance (anything above 1600) is really nasty and should be avoided. * USB download of photos and movies is pretty slow. * Movies are limited to 7 minutes. * Auto focus can be a bit slow and the more modern Pen cameras have much faster auto focus (also depends on the lens)", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "tulejim", "ReviewID": "R1DMLFU3H769ZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it for my wife so she can use some of here legacy Olympus lenses.

At that point, I already had the GX1 and I now also have the OM-D E-M5(absolutely wonderful). The reason I purchased this one was I wanted to give a try at star lines, using 30 minute exposures. A cheap camera with a 30 min exposure as opposed to Panasonic's 2 minute limit was very enticing, and I went with body only since I had lenses already.I've used this camera as a backup from time to time, and still will (and will probably be my portable one, as I think I'll give my GX1 to my brother). Where I see it really shine though, is how said brother uses it. He has a much tighter budget than me, so he's been using one of the features of m43s that originally drew me to the system: cheap legacy lenses. I have a few too (a Minolta 50mm 1.4 and a Vivitar 200 f3.5) but aside from the kit 14-42 I sent him, my brother uses all legacy lenses. He has several Minotla lenses (a 28mm f2.8, a 50mm 1.7, a 100-300 zoom) and the pictures he gets from them are great. They were also all very cheap, ranging in some cases from ~$40. I don't believe he's spent even $100 on a single lens.This camera compliments that setup perfectly. It's cheap, great image quality, has a very handy zoom to help precise focus in MF, and has In Body Image Stabilization, allowing all the legacy lenses to be adapted well even for low light stills. The only additional thing I would probably recommend is the viewfinder, but, unfortunately I don't have either to make that a 100% recommendation. On the GX1 and the OMD they help tremendously, even with stabilizing the camera further, so hence my recommendation (also, bright sunlight).As a legacy lens + m43 camera, with pricy in mind: full 5 stars.As a m43 only camera, it is still good, but it's a bit slower in auto focus than the others. It also has a slower max shutter speed at 1/2000; I often find myself using 1/4000 if I'm trying to pull DoF blurring on certain objects(and even then sometimes 1/4000 isn't enough). This could be solved by ND filters I suppose, but having the faster shutter would have been nicer. Still, this is an early, and again, cheap, model. It has some HDR features, but not nearly as comprehensive as GX1 or OMD: only 3 stop EV(plus 3 stop ISO) contrasted with 7 stop on GX1 and, if I read it right, somewhere around 5-6 stop on the OMD EM5.So to repeat, excellent for legacy lenses, or a mix between legacy and mft, especially if you're on a budget. 5 stars.If you're going strictly m43 and might get some of the more expensive lenses, you may want to spend a bit more, 4 stars there.Excellent camera, recommended purchase.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "An amazing value for those with older film lenses", "Author": "Donovan Chapa", "ReviewID": "R3MY810MM4GX9N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked up the Olympus E-PL1 as a smaller backup camera to my DSLR.  I already had a Canon G10 as a backup camera, but I needed something that was more versatile and could be used in low-light (without a flash).  Paired with the Lumix 20mm f1.7 pancake lens, the PL1 becomes quite the compact powerhouse.  It's fast, easy to focus, and fits in a coat pocket.Other lenses of the m43 line can be a bit on the expensive side (at least compared to Canon or Nikon), but every now and then there is a good deal on a lens or two ($99 for the Oly 40-150mm the other day). So far, it's served very nicely as a backup camera.But one place this camera really shines is when you mate it with old film lenses via adapters.  I've been using it lately with an OM to m43 adapter and a range of OM lenses (the 90mm macro has been my favorite so far).  Going full manual has been a nice challenge for me, but I've picked cooperative subjects (macro photography with flowers and things) to reduce the frustration as I'm learning. Using the magnification function during focus makes it so much easier to get crisp pictures.So far, I've used it with native m43 lenses, 43 lenses, and OM mount lenses, and each work without any hitches.  I've held off getting the EOS to m43 adapter because of the general lack of easy aperture control, especially when I can already do it so effectively with the OM lenses.I had read that the rear LCD of the PL1 becomes washed out in direct sunlight, so I purchased an LCD hood off of ebay that actually anchored itself using the hotshoe.  It was made for a PL2, so I had to shave the plastic a little so it fit flush against the back of the camera, but it works like a charm, and allows the camera to maintain a \"small\" profile.Overall, I would say that this is a capable compact camera which becomes an amazing value to those who have access to (or are willing to purchase) older film and digital lenses.  Even though the PL1 is an older camera itself (there's a PL5 now), I'd say repurposing this inexpensive but well-made camera is a win-win situation all around.PROS-very inexpensive (when on sale at Cameta Camera, it was less than $150, including shipping).-excellent image quality with the right lenses.-extremely versatile as a digital back for older film lenses, many of which can be purchased cheaply.  Adapters are also cheap, and range widely in the mounts you can use.  It can also be used with small telescopes for basic astrophotography.-built in image stabilization instead of in-lens stabilization allows old film/non-stabilized lenses to \"inherit\" IS.-flash angle can be easily modified by simply tilting it upwards.CONS-no remote shutter release, either wired or wireless.  The 2 or 12 second delay can be used instead for some applications, but it's not as nice.-a dedicated scrolling wheel button would have been nice to further simplify changing aperture/shutter speed/iso/etc.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "MUCH MORE than expected!", "Author": "M.

In fact so much so that every shot looks artistic in itself without any post processing. Sold off my Rebel XS !Having heard about a lot of issues with autofocus in the \"14-42 mk I\" version of the  lens, I had found a deal on Amazon which was selling \"14-42 mkII\" lens for about $150.Also, I had read at places that the MK-II version solved the autofocus issues the MK-I had to a great extent.So got the E-PL1 body and the MK-II version of 14-42 lens.The speed that I'm getting from autofocus using this combination is good and for me it is not of any concern. It is equal or better than the Rebel XS I had.One small thing about the lens cap - Something about the lens cap mechanism made me continiously fit the lens cap back on loosely, and one day I just lost it somewhere. Found a lens cap by camera hunter on amazon with an attached string to connect to the camera body and am using this now.

A great innovation was the inclusion of the light meter in the camera. I used Kodachrome 25 for decades. Then came digital cameras and film went the way of dinosaurs so my two OM 2Ns are tucked away not even worth selling. My first digital was an Olympus back around 2000 and after working with various other brands (Canon and Minolta) I decided to try the E-PL1. It is a fine little camera, but the wisdom of camera designers these days is to include dozens of \"features\" in multiple menus and menus in menus so that using a camera is like trying to use Microsoft Word.There are no knobs or dials so that changing shutter speeds, ISO equivalents, and even focusing all require fumbling (especially in cold weather) with multiple menus and dozens of choices. Thus there is no simplification of functions just the addition of more and more functions. Fortunately there is always the \"Automatic\" choice. The instruction booklet is of little use so I was compelled to buy \"The Olympus E-PL1 for Dummies.\"Camera makers really need to take a look at the overwhelming number of choices they have put on cameras simply because the microchip can be programmed to do things that are best done with an image processing program and, for example,  leave out the \"panorama\" setting (how often does that get used?).Okay, that grumbling is already too much. It is a nice light camera, the lenses (long and short) are likewise nice and light. The color is very good, and the movie is handy because it's there - right under your thumb. I have managed to shoot many a few second movie I never intended because that button is right where one puts one's thumb when holding the camera.
