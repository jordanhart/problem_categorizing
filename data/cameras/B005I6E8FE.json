Chaney", "ReviewID": "R1L6W8W57BHIPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say that I was happy to be one of the first people to buy this camera.  I actually received it before it was being officially marketed at BestBuy stores.  I saw a lady online post that the camera was in storage at many of the stores but that you could request for them to retrieve a box from storage, and they couldn't refuse you to buy one for a sale.  I didn't believe this tactic, but I went to a BestBuy, and tried it.  The guy told me that they had it in the back, and came back with three boxes.  I was so surprised, and he then asked me, \"Which color would you like.\" Apparently, it wasn't being officially marketed, but you could still unofficially request one, and be allowed to purchase it.  I felt lucky.  I used it on my birthday (Sep 30).  I freelance with photography as a serious side hobby, and I own a Canon 60D.  I have been waiting impatiently for this Elph 310 HS to come out, due to it's new HS system, larger and 450,000 dot per square inch Hi Def (improved) 3\" screen, and the improved 8x optical zoom (which btw worked wonders).  When I started using this at Disneyland, my friends and I was amazed at the clarity of the pictures.  Being a serious freelance photographer, it have a lot of high standards when it comes to picture quality, shutter speed, and overall satisfaction.  I was blown away by this camera.  Not only that, but I was also blown away by the 1080p quality of the video (wow).  I didn't buy this for video, but geese-it's great! I will, however, advise anyone buying a camera with any megapixel count over 3mp, to buy a high speed memory card.  Do not be fooled into buying a cheap memory card.  The standard is this.  Buy one with at least 20MBPS speeds or more (nothing less  This will cost at least 39 bucks for a 16Gigabite card, and you will thank me later, trust me.  Try buying that cheap, crappy, slow card, you will notice shutter lag, video will stop all of a sudden while you are recording video 10 seconds into recording, and you will notice that your camera is super slow when trying to take pictures.  Remember that your memory card is like a computer processor.  The slower it is, the slower your computer will perform calculations.  Keep this in mind.  Suggested brand and memory capacity?  Sandisk 16GB (Class 6) SDHC card (it's labeled SANDISK ULTRA).  Well worth your buy.  I hope this helps you all.  You will not be sorry with this camera.  One thing I will say is that the menus took some getting used to, and the buttons are way too flat for my larger sized fingers, but most of you will probably not have the same trouble I do with that issue, lol.  I'm 6.5'with large hands.  Any questions, please feel free to reply.  You won't believe the results of your new Canon Elph 310 HS.  Trust me.  I know what I am talking about.

After a Few Tweeks", "Author": "Matthew Prieto", "ReviewID": "R2FVRG7T53CX2X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a replacement to my Canon SD870IS which I was very happy with. The features that really caught my eye in the 310 HS were the 1080p video, 12MP images (I print LARGE poster size images at time), the large LCD screen and the new flash technology. I didn't want a touch screen as my interface so I went with the 310 instead of the 510.So far I've taken about 500 pictures and 20 videos (some 1080p others 720p) with the camera both inside and outside. Overall I'm impressed with the quality of the pictures and VERY impressed with the video quality.Pictures:When you set the camera to Auto is does a decent job at detecting the environment. It adjusts the focus/lighting accordingly and takes a decent pictures. However, there are times where I have been taking a wide angle scenic view and it decides to focus on the nearby post and adjust to macro.  When it does that, the picture comes out a little grainy and some areas are out of focus.  You can't see it on the LCD screen, but when you get it out of the camera and on a larger screen it really shows.The Image Stabilization (IS) feature is really nice to have.  You can watch the camera adjusting for your minor movements that you may have when holding the camera up.The camera offers the ability to take pictures in numerous formats. The default is 4:3, but it also offers, 16:9, 3:2 and 1:1. The manual mode allows you the ability to changing lighting, ISO, scene, white balance and compression. There are way too many modes to go into each one (26 in total).If you want to take excellent quality pictures you need to be aware that Auto isn't always what you want and if you move that switch to manual and adjust the settings the pictures will come out looking sharp and cleaner.Videos:This is really where the camera shines.  The videos are fantastic.  You can shoot at 1080p and 720p or your standard 480i. The IS for the videos works flawlessly. My first \"test\" video was of my kids playing soccer and me purposely moving the camera to see how the IS works.  After downloading it and viewing on a 60\" TV there were times where we though the camera was placed on a tri-pod.  The IS works that good. The video quality is top notch and most of the time I shoot at 720p.The format of the videos are MOV.  Previous Canon camera shot videos using AVI.  This camera will not play back any AVI files (as I found out because I swapped memory sticks from my old to new).Shooting a 1080p results in a video total bitrate of roughly 36K kbps at 23fps and audio bit rate of 1600kbps.  Shooting at a 720p resulted in a video total bitrate of 25K kbps at 29fps and an audio of 1600kbps.  Audio is 2 channel stereo at 48kHz for both.However, there are two things that I wish this camera did different when it comes to video.  The first is the size of the videos and it's compression.  At 1080p a 1 minutes and 45 seconds the video is 460MB in size. Given this is a HD video, but other cameras and even some phones offer the same quality and time with less space. The second is the removal the \"Time Lapse\" feature of videos.  With my SD870IS it had the ability to record a video as a time lapse that would allow it to take a pictures every 1 or 2 seconds and stitch it into a video. I utilized that feature on numerous occasions and it has been removed.Battery:The battery claims to take 250 pictures on a single charge. However, I was only able to get about 180 (no flash) on the first charge before I had to insert a different fully charged battery. Perhaps it will increase overtime and as the battery becomes more used.  I would recommend that you invest in an additional battery and carry that with you as well.  From the time that the \"low battery indicator\" came on I was able to get about 15 more pictures before it shutdown.Design:I was hoping that they would offer the Red of the 510HS on the 310HS but I can't fault them for that. The case is nice and well put together.  It's very functional and the buttons are intuitive and properly placed. I have not had an incident where I pushed the wrong button.Overall I'm really impressed with the camera and it's feature set. It will take some adjusting to make sure that Auto is taking the pictures that I want it to take, but overall it's a great camera.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera, way better than the 300 HS!", "Author": "Amy Matsuno", "ReviewID": "R2K576NRVXTHAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is FANTASTIC. After losing my Canon SD 630 (which I've had since 2006), I was nervous I wouldn't find a camera that I would love again. I had originally ordered the 300 HS, and had it for about two weeks and then I found out that the 310 HS was coming out so I decided to return the 300 HS. I also wasn't really impressed with the 300 HS to begin with. There are tons of great reviews about it out there but I really was not satisfied (shutter lag was horrible -- even though I had an 8 GB memory card, pics came out blurry a lot, the exterior felt and looked cheap, and the quality of the pics were not that great considering that it was rated so highly). This is ridiculous considering that this camera was made 5 years after my old one, and I still thought my SD 630 was better quality! I took my chances on the 310 HS after reading all the specs and improvements and I am beyond glad that I made the switch to the 310 HS.The color in the pictures looks beautiful, pictures look vivid, the video is superb (literally, the quality looks like a legitimate video camera), the exterior is sleek and glossy (unlike the scratchy cheap look of the 300 HS), the zoom is unreal (i went to a concert and was standing very far from the stage and was able to get a 32x zoom on the singer's face and the picture looks completely in focus and clear). Pictures so far on this camera often make it look even nicer than what the actual setting looked like. In addition, the 3 inch screen is a huge improvement over the smaller 300 HS screen. It's super vivid! I'm in love!Quick note: You should totally buy the purple version of this camera! I got it after debating between the plain black or the metallic purple. It looks very modern and makes you stand out in the crowd. I like the glossy/shiny look of it and it doesn't make it look cheap (which was my biggest concern when I chose a color instead of silver or black).", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome, tiny cam w/ one BIG caveat - don't put it in your pocket!", "Author": "Rob V. \"rob\"", "ReviewID": "R32BX4112EOD3T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I get to the negative portion, I've got to say this is a functionally oustanding camera.  I spent a great deal of time weighing this cam against the 300 HS, 500 HS, 510 HS, S95, S100 and SX230 HS.  This camera turned out to be the best combination of features and functions I could hope for... a fairly wide angle at the short end, great 8x zoom, and unbelievable low-light shooting.  Its ability to get good shots both near for close-ups, and from far away (at concerts, as an example), in very low light is nothing short of stunning.Before I received it, I wondered if I should have ordered one of the cams sporting an F2.0 lens, but in practice, the backlit CMOS sensor has an amazing ability to pull in enough light - like no other P&S; I've ever used - and I've had a lot of them.  Speedwise, it is very responsive.  I still have yet to try things like wide-aperture intentional background blurring, and more extensive video use, but I'm already in love with the thing, regardless.  It's good for nearly every situation, and I'm very excited about taking it to another year at Lollapalooza and numerous Chicago street fests.The reach of the 8X zoom is great too, and with 12 mp of data, you have plenty of room to crop and blow up for an even closer shot.  Detail at the telephoto end is excellent.  Colors are very vivid and true-to life, a feature common to all 5 of our current Canon cameras.  I dare say the image quality is as good as, or better than my beloved, but slow G7.Now to the major problem... durability.  The outside case feels solid enough, despite the plastic battery/SD card door.  However, the metal lens housing is EXTREMELY thin.  I bought this camera to replace my SD870, which due to such a touchy power button had opened up too many times in its case and in my pocket, resulting in every photo being focused on one side and blurry on the other.  Since it's so small, I'm compelled to place this little sucker in my pocket.  It doesn't turn on and open up so easily like the 870, but I already have unwittingly given it a slight dent in the front of the lens housing, which has made the lens protector stick open when I shut it off.After working with it a bit, the lens now completely covers, but I'm bound and determined to keep it in the hard-sided case I bought for it.  Like I said, the housing is EXTREMELY thin.  I have finally learned my lesson.  I tend to be pretty careful with all my cameras and gadgets, but I seriously think you can dent it by leaning up against a countertop (which is easier to do than you think), or having your keys in the same pocket.  I would gladly have given up another 1 or 2mm and another $10 or $20 for a better build.Sooo... if you can keep it out of your pants pocket, I'd highly recommend this camera.  I'd give it 6 stars for versatility and image quality, but then it loses two for durability.  Still... well worth 4 stars.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not quite sure about this camera yet...", "Author": "MKinz \"Mindi\"", "ReviewID": "R2M48XAGAVV71T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, let me say this camera does take some great pictures and it is very easy to use.  My complaint comes in by how plastic it feels.  It just doesn't feel solid like all the other Canon cameras we have purchased in the past. I love my husband's Canon Powershot 300HS, but I wanted a bit higher zoom.  So, I purchased this one.  I also purchased the Powershot 510 as well to see which one I would like better.  I must say, I am swaying towards returning both of them. This camera feels flimsy compared to the other Canon Powershot cameras.  I prefer the non-touch screen of this one vs. the Powershot 510, but overall, the 510 just feels a lot more solid for only around $75 more.  The touchscreen on the 510 drains the battery too fast, but this one just doesn't seem to be that durable.  As for the zoom comparisons, on the 510 it zooms to 12x, but it is extremely difficult to keep it steady.  On this one, the 8x seems about right.  So, I am not quite sure which one to keep.  I love the new settings for vivid, foliage, miniature, fireworks, fisheye, etc.  If it weren't for all these new settings and a higher power zoom, I wouldn't even consider trading up from the 300HS for this one.  So, I am torn as to what to do.UPDATE 10/30/2011 - So, I decided to keep this one instead of the 510.  It still feels kind of plastic to me compared to older models we have.  However, I have been thoroughly impressed with the video, picture and color quality.  The battery longevity helped to make this decision as well.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "pro review: one of the most useful and versatile point-and-shoots also creates stunning images", "Author": "Roldan Pozo", "ReviewID": "R20L4HUHKGNG7J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although most of my photography is in fine art studio work, I still use DSLRs and small point-and-shoots for travel and personal snapshots.  I have owned and used both Nikon and Canon, and have personally used the Canon 780, S90, S95, and Elph 300, as well as this 310.  Keeping in mind that photography is 95% photographer and 5% equipment, this 310 does allow one to create stunning images in more diverse conditions than its predecessors, including the S90, S95 series.  These are all fine cameras, but the 310s extended lens range (29mm - 233mm equiv) basically eliminates the need to pack a bulky DSLR when I want to travel light.  Also, the low-light performance of the 310 is much improved over previous sensors of this size.Video quality is excellent for a camera this size.  One of my disappointments with the otherwise excellent S90/95 was its video performance: choppy and poor focusing.  (The older 780 was much better.)  Canon must have listened to customers, as the 300/310 both employ much better video (1080p / 24fps) particularly in low light.  The audio, I found, was much better than average.I had not done a head-to-head comparison between the 300 and 310 as I didn't have them in front of me at the same time, but judging from the shots I took with both of them, I was more impressed with the consistent quality of the 310 overall.  (May not make musch sense, as the electronics of both cameras are said to be identical.) Regardless, the extended range is definitely worth the $50-$60 price difference.In good light, you can actually use the 12MP resolution to create stunning images.  There is a tiny amount of chromatic aberration and an ever-so-slight softness around the edges (and no, it is not the same as my $2K Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 zoom) but it is actually quite impressive that this camera captures so much detail.

The large screen makes reviewing photos a pleasure. Colours are crisp and clear. I went out with a few friends to have dinner the night that I took it out of the box and it was a hit with them as well. They noticed the crisp colours and took note of the model - they were that impressed. It works well in low lighting - the flash is very bright so pictures may look overexposed , but hey - at least you get to see everything and too much light is better than not enough of it.I spent a looooong time checking out reviews and if you are in my old shoes, I suggest that you get the leather case made by Canon sold on Adorama.com for 12$. It fits perfectly and make a stylish addition to any outing. Secondly, get a screen guard - the clear adhesive that you get to protect your phone. I put on mine the day after I used it which  meant cleaning it carefully with babywipess, cotton and the cloth that comes with th ephone screen protector.I will also warn you that you will need at least a class 10 16GB SD card to go with this camera since the pixels take up space and the SD card influences shutter speed since it affects processing time internally.The menu is loaded with lots of great features. Make sure that you read the manual that comes with the CD so that you can access those features.Additionally, I have to give Amazon props for super speedy shipping. I ordered it Wednesday night and it was in my hands by Saturday evening.This camera is an excellent investment for anyone who is picky about features and pictures. The extra pixels dont mean much. Camera features matter much more and thsi Canon baby is it!Finally, go to youtube and check out the reviews of the camera. One of the first reviews you will find is by a photography editor who explains the DIFFERENCES between this model and ELPH 300. This will help you to make a decision in the event that you don't know if you want to put out the extra fifty bucks for the ELPH 310. His video review was actually the most helpful review I found - the video means you get to see pictures that he's taken.Having owned a camera I disliked for two years, this camera is a welcome change.

I have the 300 hs and thought the 310 hs would offer a few upgraded features. It arrived about two hours ago and couldn't wait to try it out. I already had a charged battery so I was good to go. I love the added zoom and the pictures are detailed  and had plenty of color. I ordered this camera because of the good reviews and didn't pay much attention to a comment about motor noise. Boy, was I wrong. I took several videos inside and out, with  very little noise and in a noisy background. Every single video I took had a loud motor noise when zooming. I only heard the noise when the video was played back on my computer. I was also using a class 10, 16g Sandisk card.  I didn't expect this because my 300 hs has no added noise when zooming. I guess if you don't zoom while trying to video it would work but that really defeats the whole purpose. I am very disappointed so packed it up and asked for a refund due to being defective. I still might try another 310 hs in the future because it meets all of my requirements and would be great on vacation. I hope this helps someone.Update!  Well, I decided to give it another try and purchased another 310hs. The motor noise is still there but have made peace with it because the quality of the pictures are so good.

Cash", "ReviewID": "R2V414V1YD1488", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...I used it.  My main question was something like \"Can I have the power of a larger camera in a small package?\"  I read multiple reviews of about 5 different Canon cameras.  I always study things before I buy.  It is not so much the money, but just want to have the right camera for my needs.  Here is my background- I am a novice photographer, but I take a lot pictures and have had some good success because of canon's powerful cameras. I have owned the S1, S3, and the SX10, which were revolutionary for their time.  They are had the longest OPTICAL zoom I could find and yet not be an SLR. The SX10 came out over 2 years ago and 20 optical zoom was incredible.  I loved each one of those cameras, but there was one thing that changed in my life....I have two small kids.  I found myself leaving my camera at home a lot and not using it much. Those cameras are like bricks hanging around my neck. Taking pictures became a chore.I did not go a smaller camera earlier because of the low optical zoom.  However, this ELPH has 8 optical zoom (the 510 has 12!), which is a far cry from the 20 zoom on the SX10, but is a nice compromise due to its size.I have had the ELPH for a week now.  I brought to an NFL footbal game and was up in the upper deck.  I was amazed at the quick shutter, clarity of photos and the zoom.  Furthermore, many new canons have this new mode called High Burst.  It takes about 8 pictures per second. I was most skeptical of this because this is what SLRs do.  Anyway, at the NFL game I had it in this mode and held down the button for about 3 seconds.  It produced 33 separate snapshots all in focus! It is like a time elapsed movie unfolding.  Furthermore, have you ever treid to photograph a 3 and 5 year old?  Trying to get them took look at the camera and smile at the same time?  Well, this week I took some photos of my little ones and held down the take button...there is always a 'keeper' out of all those.  The only thing is they are not always focued due to lighting(the flash does not go off in this mode).I decided the 310 over the ELPH 510 because I did not want a touch screen.  I like to push buttons and feel them depress.  Besides it was over $100 cheaper.One last thing- if you can do your research and somehow go to a store to actually hold the cameras, it will confirm things for you(then buy it on amazon ;) ).  'Feel' is a big thing for me.  My old cameras were heavy, sturdy and had a big handle; I have big hands.  Even though the ELPHs are 25% the weight and much smaller of my old cameras, I have handled the 310 just fine. It does not perform exactly like my SX10, but pretty close.  Besides it is nice to put it in my shirt pocket and be much more mobile.Good luck.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good and bad experience with this camera so far", "Author": "Christine", "ReviewID": "R3OBAUT3HIGJ1H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading so many good reviews about Canon elph 310HS, I bought the camera last month from Costco just before Thanksgiving.

I never got one picture that you would call crispy. I tried both auto and manual mode. Not sure whether I saw any improvement. However, the video quality of this camera is so good that I really hate to give it up. I just could not believe so many people are wrong about this camera. So I went to Best Buy today and bought another one to compare.What a surprise! I immediately noticed a difference in the image quality. It is so much better now. After playing with it a little more, I found out what may cause the problem with the first one. According to the manual, when in Auto mode, the camera is supposed to display an icon on the upper right corner for the scene it has determined. This never happened with my first camera. The scene displayed is always 'Auto' no matter what subject I shot for. The second one will change according to the subject. However, unless you compare these two cameras side by side, it is hard to notice this may be an issue. But this definitely explains why most of my pictures taking with the first camera are blurry.

Before considering those cute little Elves, try to remember the days when you asked the subject to remain still for a second and to say \"cheese.\"  If you're not a speed-freak, or a mother trying to film hyper-active 2-year-olds, the Canon PowerShot A1200 has been shown to produce pictures equal to cameras at 5 times the price. And some shooters may even prefer having more surface area to grab on to and larger controls to navigate.If you're attracted to small things and you've decided that the irresistible price of the hugely popular Canon Elph 300 is worth going up one grade from the Canon Elph 100, you're gaining a marginally smaller camera, a marginally more powerful lens, a slightly faster shutter speed while losing .3\" of display screen size.  The small price for the upgrade (assuming the discounts for the 300 hold) along with the high ratings the 300 has received from sites like Cnet and publications like CR probably make the 300 the better choice.Unfortunately, Canon has muddied the waters by introducing the Elph 310.  At least, this latest marketing maneuver should assure that the 300's discounts remain firm (especially since there is, as yet, no Elf 110).  The 310 offers a larger display-- the same 3\" screen as the Elph 100--and it comes with a longer lens than the 300 (8 power instead of 5).  Moreover, one of the most trusted reviewers of videocameras--Stever-digicams.com--ranks the Elph 310 as the best camera in its class (out of 5 classes based on camera price.  But since Steve doesn't have a review for the 300,  a consumer might just as well infer that Steve would be no less enthusiastic about the lower-priced version.  In fact, the 300 is one of the few Canon Elves receiving 4 stars from Cnet.The Canon Elph 500 and 510 have a decisively longer (wider angle and telephoto) lens along with numerous other features that some spec-counters will welcome.  Also, with the 500 series Canon is obviously exploiting the current consumer craze for touch screens.  My advice: resist the novelty factor: both the 500 and 510 tend to receive marks not quite as high as the Canon 300 line.  Although they weigh the same as their less expensive brother and sister, they're definitely larger in appearance (but will fit most pockets if not pocketbooks).  One overriding negative concerning both cameras is battery power.  Because of \"touch technology\" and other added features, the 500 and 510 consume battery power at a rate that's as much as 40% faster than the batteries of the 300/310.  (One of the trade-offs you have to accept for being an Elf fan is the necessity of using Canon proprietary rechargeable batteries, even though it's so much faster and more convenient simply to load up with a couple of fresh AAA batteries.)  The other consideration, of course, is price--which may be trickier than a novice might think.  The 510, for example, is easily in the price range (perhaps even costlier) of the compact camera preferred by the pros as a \"side-kick\" to their ultra high-end SLR EOS or Nikon D7000 cameras: the Canon S-95.The Canon S-95, in fact, is one of the most highly coveted, revered cameras among all digitals, even though its specs come in a distant second to the lowly Canon Elph 100!  Why?  Because the Canon S-95 produces better pictures and can be counted upon--not simply from shot to shot but year after year. Its build quality and allowance for manual adjustments are enough to recommend it to the most demanding camera enthusiasts.  It's definitely the camera to consider for anyone who's sufficiently invested in photography to consider taking it up as a hobby.  The Elf 500 is the fuel-hungry Cadillac V8 of tiny Canons; the S-95 is the BMW.In case you're interested, the tiniest Canon Elf ever made (ignore the recent claims about the 300 being \"the world's thinnest\") is the Canon SD-780, released in 2009 and now discontinued (but still sold on Amazon).  It's a fully equipped, sturdy little camera that also takes great HD videos--so good, in fact, that I'm waiting for Canon to give me sufficient reason to replace it.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lens fails to open after 1 week", "Author": "BruceW", "ReviewID": "R2EHC2I88HX5AU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered 2 of these, 1 in Sept 2011, 1 in Dec 2011.

And, I experienced that on the first 3 days of my vacation.But then after just 5 days of use (2 days of learning the camera, then 3 days on vacation), perhaps 200 photos (max) and 5 minutes of video, the camera completely stopped working. The lens is fully extended and the camera says \"Lens Error. Will shut down automatically. Restart camera.\" That's all it does. It will not take pictures, and it will not review pictures on the card. I've removed the battery & SD card, tried powering it up dozens of times, recharged the battery, etc. It is completely stuck, broken with the lens protruding over 2 inches out front. The camera was kept in a padded case and was not dropped. Physically, it is still in pristine condition.Imagine the fun of your new compact camera purchased specifically for a vacation quadrupling in size with the lens fully extended, and then freezing halfway through your vacation! Not only does that mean no more photos, but then you get to enjoy a carrying around a stupidly-sized piece of electronics in order to return it once you get home. That is disappointing and frustrating, to say the least.At that time I bought the camera, I was not aware of the history of the Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS, the older model of this camera. If you read reviews and forums on the 300HS, you will find many that discuss the difference in quality (and problems) between those made in Japan, and those made in China. I didn't realize that there were different countries of manufacture for the same models. The item I was shipped from Amazon was made in China, though many people report having bought models made in Japan. I am not judging this camera by the simple fact that it was made in China. Rather, my interim conclusion here, which is the result of research I have done after having bought this \"made in China\" unit, and having the camera promptly break, suggests that that may be a problem.Combing the reviews on this 310 HS and the 300 HS also reveals a complaint from some owners that while zooming the lens while taking a video results in a lot of loud lens noise captured on the video; again, those with units from Canon's China plant complain about very loud noise when operating the zoom during a video. Those with units from Canon's Japan plant do not have such a problem. I didn't learn about this until after my camera broke, so I can't test that on mine. I shot some brief videos, but did not zoom during the video.Sadly, while some people are having this discussion, comparing notes about problems, in an effort to try to find a common denominator, the discussions often devolved into name-calling between brand loyalists and dissatisfied consumers. I wish to ensure Canon enthusiasts out there that this is my 6th Canon digital camera since 2003, not including the 4 that I bought for my parents over the years. Prior to that, I used Canon 35mm SLRs exclusively. I was most definitely loyal to Canons and believed that they made the best digital cameras, from the ELPHs to DSLRs. This is the first one that broke, it broke very quickly (5 days of use), and it is the first of the above-referenced 10 Canons that was made in China. The old Canons I have still work perfectly, they are just outdated in terms of technology. This experience with the 310 HS  could simply be bad luck. It could be a coincidence that my first \"made in China\" camera broke in less than one week. But, after reading the discussions on the 300 HS, I am doubting that it's a coincidence. Further, why risk it? People with both this 310 HS model and the 300 HS model made in Japan unambiguously love their cameras. The problems encountered by people are extremely highly correlated with units made in China.I think that the lesson here, after reading about all the 300 HS problems, other reviews here, and my experience is that the Canon cameras made in China have a higher failure rate than those units made in Japan. Unfortunately, this probably means brick-and-mortar shopping so you can read the box \"Made in ___\" before checking out. I bought a silver one from Amazon on November 21. It says \"Made in China\" on the box and on the camera. I specify this because in other reviews people are asking the reviewer those very questions: what color did you buy, where and when did you buy it, and where was it made.Amazon is going to replace my camera, but it will be over a month before it is back in stock.

In the USA Canon sells an entirely different camera called the SX 230HS.  Ordering the camera or batteries becomes a test of your ability to clarify Canon's terrible nomenclature.  There are reviews of this camera that incorrectly refer to it as the ELPH 230HS!Buy a couple of extra batteries from Amazon (NB-4L) for $10 each (get the 1200 mamp type.)  Don't get the NB-5L type battery for the 230HS.  The $6 Case Logic TBC-302 case nicely holds two extra batteries and the camera.In the \"Auto\" mode you get good movies and excellent stills.  The really nice part is that you get these results without having to bother with camera settings.  Switching to the \"P\" mode gives you more options and settings to play with but, if you just want excellent results leave it in auto.When taking a pic, push the exposure button \u00bd way down to focus.  When the focus area turns green push the button the rest of the way.  Focusing generally takes less than \u00bd a second.  If you just push the button all the down you'll often get an out of focus pic.  Forgetting to focus may explain why some reviewers are dissatisfied with the cameras output.  There are both pro and con arguments for this focusing method.  You just need to be aware of how to operate the 310.11x14 borderless prints exhibit excellent quality when shot in good light.  Quality does decrease in darker situations but is still acceptable.  All small sensor cameras exhibit that behavior.  Facial recognition works most of the time.Pricing is a little strange.  At the time of this writing, depending upon color, the price varies from $196 to $230 for the same camera from the same vendor.  Why does a blue copy cost 15% more than a purple copy?

Bought it from BestBuy because my initial order with Amazon was cancelled after they failed to deliver properly. Neverminds.I have had the IXUS 70 since 2008 and it was built like a tank in a metal frame. Never had any problem with it despite the fact that it might have been abused over time with rain, sea-corrosive air and 30,000 pictures. I don't consider myself a pro photographer but I am an a serious amateur photograph and I like to be creative within the limitations of these compact cameras while requiring the smallest form-factor possible. No DSLR for multiple day hikes for me, thanks.Fast forwarding one month, I have used it in SFO for a trip to see the Elephant seals at Piedras Blancas and Big Sur. Photos and zoom are allright for a camera this size even though there is very visible corner softness on the 1/10 left and right most vertical bands of the photos (which I did not get on the old IXUS70). I guess this is the wide angle zoom (28mm) that led to some compromises. Anyway, I bought it mostly for the zoom for travel and wildlife photography.Last week I arrived in Baltra took a few picture of the aircraft on the tarmac and board my ship. I open again the camera while on the balcony only to get the dreaded \"Lens Error, Camera will restart automatically\" message.WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING?I have been extremely careful with my camera, never blocked the zoom, shocked it or anything like that.The camera zoom does not move anymore and is locked outside the casing. Camera is useless on the very first day of my cruise of a lifetine.At this point I am extremely pis**** with Canon and this POS. Aggravating is the fact that this lens error message has kept affecting Canon cameras for the last two or three years and they have done nothing to correct it. (never had i on my old Ixus 70).Needless to say that they ruined my first day of the cruise with this. I took my old Ixus with me (hopefully) and continued the trip with it but I was really angry that first day since I bought the ELPH310 for its longer zoom and better high ISO performances.I got one of those ELPH310 made in China. Maybe a factor? Don't think I'll buy again from them.I write this review to warn prospective customer of these issues. You might get an unreliable camera with this model. In addition, this incident is not isolated. Read other previous reviews regarding the ELPH310 to realize that the LENS ERROR is in fact quite common and require the Camera to be returned to Canon. Great for a cruise!!Also, I found the Camera battery to be quite limited for this camera. Both my previous IXUS-70 and this new ELPH-310 are CIPA rated for 210 pictures and use the same battery, namely the NB4L. However, I could take on average 20% more pictures with the old camera (same battery, same type of operations with no flash used).This amounts to about 140 pictures for the ELPH-310 which is definitely not a lot. When will Canon upgauge their batteries to account for the increase drain on the battery with the larger screens? NB4L has been around for at least three years now.

Standard auto setting is great (as usual) about 90% of the time, but get comfortable with the other settings as well, because you definitely will run into situations where the programed settings work better. Portrait and video work well.All this has been said before, but (and this is a little weird), the reason I'm reviewing it is that I chose the purple camera based on a rumor that the purple ones are made in Japan.  (There's ongoing debate in the community as to whether quality in Canons coming out of China is comparable to Canons coming out of Japan.)  My black 300 was made in China, and it felt a little off.  They're different models, I know, but I figured since I have to buy a new one anyway, I'd try to get one made in Japan to compare - and for me the rumor was correct.  The purple camera I purchased was indeed made in Japan.My 310 feels a lot sturdier than the 300.  The lens cover, which was a little slow/off on the 300, closes completely and quickly.  The battery/memory card cover is definitely sturdier on this camera than on the last.  Camera's a little thicker and heavier, which I actually like, but that's probably the model difference.  The finish - well, I wasn't a fan of the textured black, so maybe that's not a fair comparison, but the smooth purple is much nicer and seems just as sturdy, possibly more so.All in all, I'm glad I went to the trouble of hunting down the purple \"made in Japan\" model.

That's how I've used Canon point and shoot cameras for seven years.When my four year old Canon SD850IS was lost, I naturally decided to look for a new Canon point and shoot camera.  I considered the Canon S100, and the Canon 510 HS.  However the S100 wasn't in stock.  Also many S100 reviewers for it said for people like me, who shoot in automatic mode and want JPEG not RAW, the S100 was a waste of money.  The 300 HS or 310 HS was often recommended instead.  Regarding the 510 HS, many reviewers at the time, including the main reviewer whose title is \"Oh Canon, what have you done???\" did not like it.  Therefore I never considered the 510.  I did consider the 300 but the 310 is the updated model for it, so I ended up buying the 310.I've had it for a few weeks and I've used it a lot.The picture displayed on the back of the camera after each shot usually looks great.  Unfortunately the picture that is downloaded usually looks not great.  Every Canon point and shoot I've ever owned takes better pictures than the 310. My four year old Canon takes far far better pictures.  The picture quality for the 310, by comparison, is like the picture qualify of a smart phone.Maybe this is not the year to buy Canon CMOS point and shoot cameras.  It may make sense to wait a year for Canon to get the bugs out.  The S100 and 510 were not for me based on what their reviewers said.  After living with the 310 for a few weeks, I know the 310 is not a good choice for me either.  If you own a small Canon point and shoot camera that works for you, I wouldn't recommend buying these current model Canon point and shoots at this time. If my four year old point and shoot Canon weren't stolen I would be happier using it, than with my new Canon.  If I were to recommend a point and shoot to someone today, I might consider a non-Canon like the Nikon Coolpix P300, based on its favorable reviews, although I haven't used that camera.My review is for a silver made-in-China version of the Canon 310 HS.  The made-in-Japan version may be better.  The version I have is unable to take good indoor pictures, in an automatic mode. I understand it is good at taking videos.

Most of her pictures are taken with a flash and posted on facebook so the nicer lens in the S100 is not really much benefit. The 8x zoom on the 310 is amazing, and the image stabilization works. Very impressive.By comparison he S100 is an awesome camera technically but did not feel nearly as good in the hand. There are more buttons and the pop-up flash to get in the way of holding it. Also feels very solid but that translates to about double the weight (using the elbow scale).  So the 310 is the big winner for the intended purpose.

After contacting Canon I decided that I had a defective unit, so returning the camera for a refund. I am a bit hesitant to try again since this is a new model and seems like they are still trying to sort out quality issues.Problem 1: In video mode, there is a very loud humming noise when image stabilization is ON. This noise is not the motor noise from zooming, it happens without touching the zoom. The noise is very loud and overwhelms any other sound in the recording. Only way I could get rid of the noise was turning IS OFF completely.To check if yours have the same issue try the following:1) Turn on ELPH 310HS2) Make sure IS ON (continuous or shoot only mode; powered IS ON/OFF does not seem to make a difference).3) Start shooting a video and make sure camera tries switching between scene selections automatically. For example, in a moderately lit room, try focusing on a computer screen. Camera  tries switching to non-human spotlight setting and during that there is a large humming noise that can easily be heard by naked-ear.Problem 2: In view mode, when lens is retracted, LCD screen has a noticeable buzzing noise. Noise seems to diminish significantly when lens is out. This seems like a bad LCD driver to me, and I am willing to bet it will go bust in a year or two.

My SD880IS blows the 310HS completely out of the water!The 310HS images were grainy, somewhat blurry, and had a yellow tinge to them. Whereas my (3 year old) SD880IS pictures are still crisp, well focused, and it gets the white balance right (no yellow tinge).Granted, on the 310HS camera's LCD the pictures look great, but once you move them to your computer & get a real good look at them, they really leave a lot to be desired.I did direct comparison shots of the SD880IS to the 310HS in various environments (low light, outdoor in bright light, etc) and the 310HS's pictures were always worse.Also, what's with the automatic macro mode? I hated it! When I was shooting things that weren't macro (ie. my kids), it kept going into macro mode & you can't turn the darn thing off.It also chooses not to fire the flash when it clearly could benefit by firing it (which results in dark, unfocused pictures).Low Battery Life:This thing is TERRIBLE!!! When doing a video, about 2-3 minutes in, a full battery drops down to 1/2 way full, and then about 2 minutes later the low battery light starts blinking. I thought it maybe was just because I needed to give it a good recharge. Nope. Tried that. Several times. I even let it charge overnight once & it still didn't help. Then tried fully discharging it & did a full recharge. Still no dice. 3-4 minutes into a video the darned low battery light starts blinking again. If you shut the camera off, wait a minute & turn it back on, the battery is full again, but try & do another video & it's right back to the low battery light we go again!I wouldn't dare take this thing on vacation unless I was packing 2 or 3 extra batteries. I've been spoiled by my 880IS. I can usually get 300-400 shots on a single charge and MULTIPLE video's. Granted, I know HD is a battery hog, and that 3\" LCD is no help, but you'd think Canon would at least give it a battery that could handle taking video.Pros:The video's it shoots are of great quality and they do look pretty good even in low light--but if ya can't even shoot a decent length (I'm talking under 5 minutes here) without the battery dying, then what good is it?I REALLY wanted this camera to shine. I've loved all my other Canon's I own and was really excited to get this one. Unfortunately, due to the poor picture quality and poor battery life, it went back. Who knows, maybe I got a dud, but man what a dud it was!

I have always loved canons and have always had really good luck with them. All of my past canons have been very well made so, I decided I wanted another canon. I wanted a nice compact that had really good photo quality, but also looked nice. I started looking at the ELPH series and eventually I decided on either the 300 or the 310. I know people who have the 300 and love it, so I was starting to lean towards it and it's lower price tag. I went into best buy so I could compare them in person. The 300 only cam in 3 colors and the texture of the outer casing was like sandpaper. I felt like I could file my nails on it! Also I messed around with the zoom, and the 310 absolutely outshined the 300, the 300 with 5x zoom and the 310 with 8x zoom, so I went with the 310. So I have had it for about a month now and the one feature that I love is it's capabilities in low-light. I camp a lot and I am in places with little to no light other than the moon and stars and this camera takes wonderful photo even with out the flash!!!!

That means that, if you're like me, and you really enjoy light, and capturing sun and shadow, you're pretty much SOL with this camera.  At least with the one I received.  I returned it, and fortunately Amazon gave me my money back.  But it was too late for my Stockholm photos, which this camera ruined.I had the same problem with a Lumix LX3 I got shortly after it came out - photo on a calibrated computer monitor wasn't even close to the photo on my the camera in terms of contrast, and overall brightness - photo ended up far brighter than original on camera.  While my SD600 didn't show this same problem on the came computer monitor - its photos mirrored exactly what you saw on the camera screen. Same for my iphone 4s. What you see is you what you get.A few points, then a discussion of my biggest concern, the poorly calibrated screen.1. I ordered the purple one and yes the box said it was made in Japan (since that was a point of discussion in other comments).2. Yes, the camera feels plasticky.  I had the SD600 for years, loved it, and just recently dropped it (for the first time), the lens jammed, and that was that.3. The wrist-cord is a tad long.  Didn't feel terribly secure on my wrist.4. The camera is awfully light, which I liked.5. Like other Canon powershots the light meter setting (i.e., option to take light setting at a point in the center, the general area of the center, or an average of the entire photo) always sets back to the default every time you shut off the camera.  It's a royal pain, and kind of dumb.  One of the great things about the powershot is that you can set the light meter to take a reading at a point in the center of the picture, then you can pick and choose the light setting you want, lock it in, then focus and take the shot - it makes the camera \"manual\" in terms of choosing different lighting for the same scene.  But it defaults back to the \"take an average light reading for the whole photo\" every time you shut the camera off.  A real pain.Now back to the screen.  I shot a ton of photos on a recent trip to Sweden, bought the camera right before, since I had dropped my SD600 the week before.  I got some particularly nice shots at a bar a few dozen floors up, overlooking Stockholm at sunset.  Beautiful contrast of sunlight hitting some buildings and not others.  Well.  The 310 decided that I obviously didn't want such a high contrast in my photos, so it evened it out for me.  The pictures ended up showing the sun hitting a building, then the building next t to it lit up quite nicely so I could see every detail.  But that's not what the picture in the camera showed.  In the camera, the pic came out great, beautiful contrast, a silhouette really, of some buildings in beautiful sunset light while other buildings were practically blacked out.  And that is not what the photos really were.Oh, and I made sure that the other settings weren't interfering with the pic - turned the icontrast on and off, etc.  Didn't help.I also found that when I set the camera on automatic, all the photos were a tad over-exposed.  Even on the screen, they were over-exposed.I don't know if my camera had a glitch or what.  Or whether this is something \"new\" that they're doing on cameras of late - making the photos brighter for people.  As I said, my LX3, which was on the order of three times the price of this camera, has the same problem, and the LX3 got rave reviews (though another friend who got one at the same time as me, hates him lx3 as well).  But there is simply no excuse for digital cameras showing you a different picture on the camera screen than what is on your computer screen.  And again, let me reiterate, my computer monitor is not only calibrated, but the Canon SD600, and my iphone 4s, both show exactly the same picture, in terms of contrast and brightness, on the camera and on my computer screen - so it's not my screen if it works for the other two cameras but not this one.In the end, my Stockholm photos were ruined.  Fortunately, I discovered this the next day, and stopped using the 310 immediately, relying solely on my iphone.  I got some great pics with the iphone, but it's even harder to hold steady than a powershot, and I loved the notion of such a great zoom on the 310 (obviously no zoom on the iphone).I wish camera reviews would get into this issue of whether the camera's screen accurately reflects the photo.  And before anyone says \"you can just edit it on your computer,\" that's hogwash.  Perhaps - perhaps - you can lighten a photo that's too dark.  And even then, it's difficult to get the contrast to look like what you saw in real life.  But good luck taking an over-exposed photo and trying to make it dark again.  Yes, I'm sure someone better at Photoshop than I could succeed, but that's not why I buy a powershot instead of an SLR - I don't want to have to edit each and every photo to death in Photoshop.I'd be curious to hear what others have found in terms of how well the photos reflect what was on the camera screen, particularly in terms of contrast and brightness versus shadow.Also, the colors were a bit too saturated as well - another 'trick' that seems pretty ubiquitous now with these cameras.So, all in all, a great price for a camera with a great zoom.

My first was the Canon SD450 and in my opinion it was probably the greatest point and shoot on earth.  Every picture came out crystal clear and it was relatively fast to auto focus and snap away.  It was also built tough as little tank with stronger chrome/metal pieces and buttons.  Next I purchased a SD1300 12.1 MP, it was the same model line but more than double the mega-pixels so I thought it would be a winner.  Nope, it was the worst camera - took forever to auto-adjust, many pictures came out blurry, and it seems it took longer to get ready for the next shot.  Additionally Canon started making the cameras lighter with more plastic pieces and other cheaper materials.  It was still useable by far less enjoyable.  In less than a year we wanted a better camera so we decided on the ELPH 310 HS because it had good Amazon reviews and also scored very high on the Consumer Reports website - it tied for the highest rated compact point and shoot.  It is much better than the previous model but not a massive improvement over the original SD450.  In all these years you'd think Canon could crank out a superior product, but I guess they are trying to cut corners to keep the price low.  It's still slightly larger than the SD450, but a lot lighter - same cheaper pieces.  In fairness I think I paid the same price for the SD450 over 5 years ago, so I guess if you want better quality it goes for a little more these days. I just find it funny how my original 5 mega-pixel camera can still almost hold up to a newer 12.1 mega-pixel model.  Overall, I would recommend this product if you are looking for a simple compact camera to take some nice crisp photos.  The pictures come out clear, once every so often you get a blurry one for some reason.  It's pretty fast to get ready for the next shot.  The view screen is huge.  A couple of drawbacks is the battery is different than some of the early Powershots so you can't use old chargers and the battery life seems slightly smaller - it should still last you for a jam packed day like Christmas or a vacation, but you'd probably have to charge it at the end of the day.  I swear I used to get at least a week out of my older cameras. Also note this comes with no SD card, but you should still be able to use the SD or SDHC type you already have. It's probably not going to give you better shots than the self focusing huge lens monsters, but who has time for that nonsense.

I thought she would prefer the blue version but it was not available directly from Amazon, and other sources were showing a higher price. Finally the week before Christmas Amazon listed the blue model as directly available at the same price as the other colors, but backordered. So I ordered it and assumed it would not get there in time. A few days later Amazon's deal of the day was a the Canon Powershot S95 at a discount so great is was practically the same price as the ELPH, and free two-day shipping! So I ordered that too. Then by some miracle of good service, the ELPH shipped and arrived in time, so I wrapped them both up and gave her the choice on Christmas morning.I explained to her that according to specs and reviews, the advantage of the ELPH is a much longer zoom range and a slightly simplified interface. The advantage of the S95 is a faster lens, more powerful flash, and quicker shot to shot. The S95 also has extensive manual and program settings unavailable on the ELPH. We decided to give them both a try, so we charged their batteries. Surprisingly, in spite of the fact that both have very similar appearing lithium ion batteries and chargers, the S95 battery charged in about half the time it took to charge the ELPH.The most dramatic difference we noticed in comparing the two camera's performance was shooting video indoors. The faster lens of the S95 produced video with much nicer color and detail. The S95 also handles difficult shots, like Christmas lights at night, better than the ELPH. And the S95 can be set on full automatic so the interface doesn't really matter until you try to use more features.In the end we decided the faster lens, faster cycling, faster charging, more powerful flash, and additional features of the S95 would probably be more important more of the time than the longer zoom of the ELPH, so the ELPH went back to Amazon painstakingly wrapped in its original packaging. The prepaid return shipping label and amazing quick refund were two more reasons to go to Amazon first.I would never have considered the S95 at its regular price, but it certainly is a better camera.

Brand \"Diesel\"", "ReviewID": "R3PTKGW9D25S1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a much older model Canon point and shoot and it just needed an upgrade so I started my search.  I really think canon makes one of the best point and shoot cameras out there for their ease of use, great picture quality and added functions. One of my favorite functions from my old camera was the color swatch and swap where you can single out a color and either choose to only show that color (everything else is B&W;) or you can switch that color out with another color i.e. a red rose can be changed to blue. It makes for a lot of fun and saves you the trouble of learning how to do these kinds of things on photoshop. When looking I saw Canon had the 300HS and the 310HS to choose from.  They are basically the same camera except the 310 has 8x zoom compared to the 300's 5x.  If zoom really isn't a concern for you go with the 300 it is cheaper but for me it was worth it to pay a little extra. The camera takes amazing shots and I was even more impressed by how good the video is. One of the coolest features this camera has is a slow motion video capture mode.  Try using it with your dog while they are running around or shaking their heads and it will amaze you. It does all the work for you all you do is press the button and you now have a super slow motion video.  Pretty cool.If you are thinking about using this camera for video as well be mindful that while the video quality is great the audio isn't amazing.  This can obviously be expected since this camera wasn't made for video and doesn't have the hardware necessary to capture sound the way a bigger video camera with dedicated mic does.The only complaint I have about this camera is the buttons on the side.  On the side of the camera there are two buttons menu & a switch for auto or not auto.  The switch is fine since you wont use it that often but the menu button is a little awkward to press. You get used to it after a while but at first it definitely feels weird.The colors choices are also awesome.  I chose the black because I liked how clean it looked but the blue was also pretty sweet looking and if they had that in stock I might have gone for that. All in all it's a great camera and I definitely recommend it. -1 star just for the weird button placement.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice camera if it stayed working", "Author": "Erik Roell", "ReviewID": "R3VC6ZPKS9KO9Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought the camera end of April 2012, August 5 of 2012 I got the dreaded \"lens error\" message that I've now read so much about.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Impressive Camera", "Author": "kmr", "ReviewID": "R1KEWUTO15GG5U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently received this camera as a birthday present and had a bit of time to fool around with it. I must say, it's a great little camera. It's not perfect, of course, but nothing is and the few flaws the Elph 310 has are mostly just minor nuisances to me.Let's start with the good:Photo Quality (Overall):The quality of the pictures I've taken has been consistently quite good. The results do vary depending on whether I'm using Auto or Program mode; for example, the photos I took on Auto had more grain, while the photos I took on Program at ISO 100 had more blur (indoors, mostly). Obviously, the outdoor photos were the best. Extreme low-light pics were more of a mixed bag; I haven't tried any on Program mode, but on Auto mode they all came out somewhat blurry. I took some pictures at a concert and was satisfied with only about half of them, and even those could have been a bit better. But I made a few edits with iPhoto so now they are more pleasing to the eye.Video Quality:The video was excellent as well. Indoor recording was very good, but once again, the outdoor quality was the best. Low-light recording was a lot better than I expected it to be, and it was quite a bit better than the low-light pictures I took at the same event. My only complaints are the slow optical zoom in this mode and the lack of an indication of how close I was to reaching the time limit for recording (I hope I'm not missing something), although this is somewhat understandable since I can't record a maximum length video on a single charge. At least I don't think I can (more about battery later).Lens:The 8x zoom is impressive for such a compact camera. When taking pictures, the lens is super fast and I got a pretty good result at maximum zoom. (I turned digital zoom off, because I think it is pointless and only gives me bad results.)Design:This camera is absolutely beautiful. I loved the design from the moment I pulled it out of the box, not just because it was the blue version (and in my favorite shade of blue, no less), but because it had such a slim and simple design. The small size of the buttons and placement of the menu button in particular are awkward, but not a huge deal. The LCD screen is nice and big, higher resolution than my old SD800 (which I used before).Options:I haven't used all of them yet, but there are a number of features I think will be very useful. One is the wind noise filter; unfortunately, I forgot to turn it on when I did my outdoor video test, but I'll remember next time. Another is red-eye reduction -- I hate red-eye. The scene modes are a neat feature. All the results -- miniature, B&W;, vivid, etc -- came out quite nicely in my test.As for the things that irritated me:Corner blur:For some reason, the corners in some of my pictures are very smudgy. This might have to do with low ISO. And as mentioned earlier, the shots I took in extreme low-light conditions were just okay. Maybe if I take them under different camera settings next time they'll come out better.Video zoom:The lens is quite fast when I'm snapping still shots, as I mentioned before, but in video recording mode it is as slow as molasses. Makes sense, since this is video we're talking about, but still. The zoom engine buzz is mildly annoying, not nearly as bad as I expected.Physical buttons:Again, awkward. Somewhat hard to press.Battery:Disappointed that I can only take 210 shots on a single charge, according to the manual. This, coupled with the fact that the battery takes a very long time to charge (as with my SD800), is rather frustrating. Video is probably worse. Haven't drained the battery yet, but I'm sure it will happen soon. I turned down the screen brightness, but I'm not sure if that alone will help at all.Conclusion:So far, so good. This is a really great camera for casual photographers who want something on them wherever they go that isn't a smartphone (smartphones have relatively lousy image quality and no optical zoom. My Droid 2 isn't terrible, but it is not my ideal snapshooter.).", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA", "Author": "IROCK", "ReviewID": "R1B85VVW7M61A7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Cannon ELPH 310 for $199.99 and the 16 gig class 6 card for $20 on Amazon for Christmas.

Despite successfully installing the driver on my Windows Vista computer, and despite the fact that Picasa easily and automatically uploads all of the photos on the camera, Picasa is unable to see or upload any video from the camera.  That means that every time I want to upload videos to my PC, I am forced to mount the camera as a drive and manually copy the videos over to my Picasa drive on my PC.  This is quite a pain in the but, especially since the camera stores the videos from different days in different folders on the camera.2.

The 870 had served me flawlessly for years, but the flash finally poofed out.The 310 is everything everybody is saying about it.  It takes great pics, has an unbelievable zoom range, and really good video.  Contrast range is good.  Nice warm colors.  28mm wide-angle equivalent is awesome.  And packing 8x zoom into a package this small is unbelievable.So what are the flaws?* Wind noise on the mic - They moved the stereo mics up on top of the camera (vs. the front on the 870) and it picks up wind noise really bad. The \"reduce wind noise\" feature is weak at best.* Lens cover/protector jams - This is a crucial feature.  They came up with some half-baked, chintzy, super-thin lens covering system that is super fragile. I keep my camera in a padded case, I've never dropped it, and I handle it with care.  Yet that lens protecting gizmo jammed after six months.  The lower leaf got stuck in the \"open\" position.  So I had to send the camera in for repairs.  Fortunately it was covered by warranty.

I hope Canon gets rid of it.If you're tough on gear and/ or plan on using this in dusty situations (which would get into the fragile and tight settings of the lens-covering gizmo), then this is NOT the camera for you.

For a classic point-and-shoot style camera there are some very easy to use functions, but it also provides great pictures without any fuss.  For any NON-Technical camera users -- this camera will be fun and provide quality photos time and time again.  For anyone who likes to play with functions & settings... here are some details:  The large screen on the back that makes it easy to see your photos!  The ZOOM provides over 20+ times for you to get close up photos.  There is HD Video on the camera and it is good quality for such a small device.  If you plan to use it often I would get a large SIM CARD because the photos take up a a lot of space.  The BATTERY in this camera is rechargeable and will last you days of power.  As for the FUNCTIONS -- they were easy to change / use on older models but there is access for you to change your ISOS, Pixels, Compression and even movie quality.  The camera has very crisp clean photos -- and you can change the settings to provide better photos for (indoor, outdoor, cloudy, etc).  Another function I use is the SELF TIMER -- It works great and only takes seconds to setup!!  Lastly, it is easy to transfer the photos onto your computer..... I have used the Canon Picture Software -- it was great!  Now I have a MAC and the SIM CARD just slides right into the side of my computer and easily dumps everything into iPHOTO!!  The iPhoto program even allows me the option to Delete or Keep my photos on the sim card.Problems:The main problem I have with this camera is taking MOTION PHOTOS --- I find that it does not capture motion well and the pictures continually come out BLURRY.

I bought the 630 as a front pocket camera (I already have a DSLR so what I'm looking for in a point-and-shoot is small size) and was looking for the same when shopping for the replacement.  I looked at the smaller cameras out there from other manufacturers but the reviews indicated mixed quality/satisfaction.  I chose the Elph 310 over the 510 because it is physically smaller, and I didn't want a touch screen.  It had to be something that everyone in my family could use, and touch screen camera UIs aren't good enough yet.I was pleasantly surprised with the results from this camera.  Compared to the 630 it's a far superior device.  The 630 could take good photos in daylight outdoors but struggled otherwise.  The 310 does really well in all lighting conditions that I've tried so far.  It's so good that we've even started taking only it when we go out, and leaving the DSLR at home.The optical zoom range on this camera is really great.  This was a real plus for me.  It's really nice to not rely on digital zoom just to get close to a subject.  I don't use the digital zoom much at all.With a camera this fast, make sure you get a good card.  I spent money to get a 32GB Sandisk 45MB/sec card, and am glad that I did.  I've never once had to wait for something to be stored.  This camera can generate a lot of data when shooting in some of the high-speed and hi-res video modes, so you want a card that can handle it.Battery life is good (I've managed 200 photos without seeing the low battery warning) but I'd still recommend a second battery if you want to use it all day long without turning it off after each photo to save battery.Very strongly recommend this camera.

It's an amazing piece of technology in a very small package and I recommend it wholeheartedly, I doubt you will find anything else that hits this sweet spot.The only area I didn't rate a full 5 is ease-of-use; I did find the Program menu a bit confusing, and it took me a while to figure out how to do force flash. The movie digest feature is cool (takes a few seconds of video *before* each photo and combines them together) but I haven't figured out what causes it to stop one combined video file and start the next.The one meaningful negative comment / missing feature that I can mention is that the camera absolutely does NOT support USB Mass Storage mode, where it just shows up like a drive letter in Windows. This is a strange omission, but apparently one that is common with Canons. The problem this creates is that without installing the supplied software (which I generally avoid with new devices if possible since they're usually crappy bloatware), you have to use the Scanner and Camera Wizard in Windows XP. Aside from the Wizard's general awkwardness, the big problem is that the USB Camera Mode (technically called Picture Transfer Protocol, PTP) in XP can handle a maximum file size of 210MB. So all my HD videos of more than ~60 seconds would not transfer successfully. There is no resolution to this problem from Microsoft ([...]). Eventually I grudgingly had to install the software supplied with the camera, and that software was able to copy the videos over fine. But if Canon would just support Mass Storage Mode (the way almost everything else out there does) then it wouldn't be an issue.

The 310 HS seemed to be even better so that is what we bought.After shooting video with it however we were very disappointed. The video is very muffled, like it is passed through a low pass filter. Also there is a very noticeable clicking in the recording that is coming from the auto focus. At first we thought it might be defective, but after some googling, and YouTube searching we found other people reporting the same thing. In fact we watched several YouTube videos made with the Elph 310 HS and we could hear the same clicking and bad quality audio in them.We verified that the clicking is the autofocus by putting the camera into (the hard to enable) focus lock. Also if you run the video through an EQ you can turn up the high end and get the audio to sound better, but the clicking gets louder as well. I suspect that Canon put in a digital low pass filter to try and quiet the noisy lens. Shame.We sent the camera back for a refund. We are probably going to buy the older Elph 300 HS.

That was the in-store price drop which is cheaper than online for some reason. With the price being just a little higher for the 310 I could justify it and I couldn't be happier. This camera is just awesome. I chose to jump up to this one passing on the 300 purely for the larger screen size. I carry a compact Canon everywhere I go and it seems that I have been using the camera for referencing photos a lot lately. So if you show people pictures or take pictures of things in order to zoom in on them and use them for reference material then the increased viewing area of the 310 screen is surely worth the upgrade. I ride motorcycles all the time and go to the snow with a Canon in my jacket pocket too. I've NEVER experienced a mechanical failure from the abuse which is simply amazing. It seems that I get about 3 years our of each one until the lens gets so dirty inside that I can't use it anymore. But I really put my cameras through some dirt, mechanic work, some construction, mounted to a motorcycle sometimes and it's in my pocket or backpack everywhere I go. I can't believe how strong these things are. I just hope the 310 can stand the test of time with me now. :)On another note I am REALLY happy with the zoom feature while video is recording. I use the video a lot and was really disappointed with the SD780 not being able to optical zoom while shooting. Both the 300 and 310 zoom while recording which I'm really really happy about. This is the one feature that really sets these compacts apart from their predecessors. So even if your SD780 (or other camera) isn't broken you might want to pick up a newer Canon for the video zoom capability.My previous camera was the famous SD780 which was an awesome machine for sure. But dust had accumulated on the inside of the lens which ruined the pictures so it needs repair. For the past couple of months I've been using the trusty backup my old SD1000 (nothing beats the styling of that unit). I have had a few of the G-series Canons as well. If I need real Canon power my photographer friend comes along with me. The compact Canons are so powerful now they are all I need 95% of the time. And I REALLY tried to shop around for a different brand of camera this time. Sony almost won me over BUT their controls and buttons are just way too hard to use. Their panoramic assist feature is really cool and I would use that a lot and I'm sure they take good pictures but the buttons are light years behind Canon in terms of design and function. I found a great Sony for $50 less than the Canon I just bought but the rotary selector for functions was a joke and a real turnoff.

So I'm basically reviewing this camera as the average teenage user and giving major first impressions. My last camera was purchased in 2007, a Canon Powershot SD 750. It lasted me five long years (which is why I continue to purchase Canon over other competitors), and I felt that if I took care of it better, I'd still be using it. But, the camera is very beat up and frequently the screen blacks out, so I felt like it was time to replace it.Over the summer, I bought the SX230 HS, but returned it after realizing how short its battery life truly was. I also did not like how bulky it seemed to be and wanted something smaller. That, and my old camera started working again. Recently, it stopped again, so I browsed the market once more. I came across the 310 HS and purchased it, after not wanting to fork over the money for an S95 (I'm not a very experienced photographer, but I hoped that getting an S95 with its manual settings might be a good way to start).I gave this camera four stars because I'm really impressed with all the features, quality and settings that this camera has to offer. I think its perfect to fit my needs: taking pictures with friends at events with ease and with a full collection of settings to help me get the shots I want.However, there were a few things I noticed that I wasn't used to:1) EXTREMELY light. I don't know why this was super noticeable, but it felt like I was almost holding a toy. It has a weird feeling to it, as if its not completely sturdy. I know its been awhile since I've had something from the current digital camera market, but I LOVED the sturdy feeling of the SD750.2) The lens cover seems more flimsy than it should be. I feel like if this camera didn't have a case and was sitting in my purse or something, the lens cap could easily be pushed open and damaged.3) The menu and camera setting (auto or porgram) buttons are awkwardly placed. Instead of being placed right next to the other buttons near the screen, they're placed on the side of the camera. So if I were to take a picture and needed to access those buttons, I would have to awkwardly move my hand. It's not too big of a deal, but it was one of those things I noticed and thought was different.I like it.

I took some shots in the plane and the lens wouldn't retract.  So, I was stuck with this non-working camera overseas for two weeks.  Ugh.  When I returned, I sent it in to get repaired.  Instead of repairing it, they returned a refurbished camera to me.  Months later, the \"refurbished\" camera started showing lines across the LCD screen in the back.  When I sent it in, they declared that this issue was not covered under the warranty.  I called to see if they could include it in the warranty due to the short amount of time I've had it and the fact that it has been used in a normal fashion.  They asked me questions like \"did you ever carry it in your pocket?\" or \"did you store it in a soft case?\" to try to shift the problem back to me.  I explained that the case does have a hard area to cover the LCD screen but it didn't matter.  They weren't budging.  I spoke with three different people and they all were emotionless in their responses to me which I perceived to mean they don't care.  It makes me think they get calls like this frequently and this is the response they were told to give.  I explained how disappointing it is to have a camera for 9 months that I had to send it twice to be fixed.  There was no apology, just standard answers.  It's ludicrous to me to pay nearly the cost of the camera to have them fixed the refurbished version they gave me.  After this experience, I'll never be buying a camera from them again.

Ended up returning the 300 and ordered the pink 310 from amazon. I hardly buy online due to scams from eBay before, but I was delighted when my package came just shortly after I placed my order and of course no damage/brand new/ perfect in pink). Amazon was great about sending me notifications about shipment& tracking was easy. As you can imagine I was waiting for this product, and for me it's easy to become impatient with shipped products but this was great!I have a Nikon D90 and I searched high and low for a good quality point & shoot (LOTS of research). I read that canon invests more money into p&s; than Nikon and let me tell you this camera takes STUNNING photos. I took awesome shots of new years fireworks and they are crystal clear , even being about 5 miles away. Just get to know the settings, that's the key to good photos with this camera. The 310 is def worth it over the 300 because the zoom is clear and can't be beat. I'll stick to Nikon for their DSLR because the performance is stellar, but for p&s; I'll deff purchase another canon 310 I anything happens to mine. Love love love & love amazon.

I absolutely love this camera!  I bought it because my 7 year old Olympus was too slow taking pictures and I was always missing great shots of my little girl.  I did a lot of research wanting to get the best camera for my money. It takes really fabulous pictures. They are bright and so clear.  Obviously outdoor shots come out better than indoor shots, but I'm happy with indoor shots as well. I often use the kids and pets setting to catch those moments with my 20 month old and my dog.  I also really like the foliage setting to take photos of the flowers in my garden.  The camera also takes really crisp and clear video.  My sister commented on a video that I posted on FB that it was so clear it was like she was right there.  You can hear the zoom in the video, but it's not terribly loud and in my opinion, does not detract from the video.  I also really love the green color.  It's nice to have a camera that is not the typical silver or black.

Not the image quality I expected.", "Author": "Mike E.", "ReviewID": "RVHAX0KYQMSVO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace a very old Casio QV-R40 - 4mp point and shoot that still takes great shots, it's just a bit bulky (to put in your pocket), and it only has a 3x optical zoom. Also, the LCD screen is very small - about 1.25\", but it does have an optical viewfinder, which I still prefer (but realize this is not going to be found on todays \"pocket\" cameras). I am a long time amateur photographer. I've been shooting with SLR's (film and digital) for over 30 years, so I know a bit about photography and image quality. I use a \"pocket camera\" for times when I don't want to or can't haul around my Nikon D300 DSLR and assorted lenses and accessories. Before purchasing this camera I did a lot of research, and based on the excellent professional and consumer reviews, I selected this Canon Elph 310HS. It has an impressive array of nifty features and things it can do, most of which I'll probably never use (like a self timer mode that you can trigger by winking at the camera! Pretty amazing but really, do you need that?). It does seem fairly simple to operate. Of course, in full Auto mode, it is as simple as it can get! It has an adequate amount of manual override features, though it would be nice to be able to control shutter speed and aperature, but not critical for the purpose I'm using it for. The Zoom is a very good range for the type of shooting I will mostly do with it, and the LCD screen is very good. I'm not into shooting video, but I did play around with the video feature on this camera, and I must say I found it very, very cool! HD-1080 and stereo mics, with zoom and image stabilization. Very impressive! This is the first camera I've owned that has video capability, and I can see how it could encourage me to start shooting some video clips. But - my first and foremost priority is \"still-image\" quality, not bells and whistles or video.Unfortunately, based on several days of shooting and comparing the results to my old Casio point and shoot, as well as to my friends point and shoot and an iPhone 4s - all taking the exact same subjects at the same time, the Canon 310HS is a HUGE disappointment. The images lack depth of color (saturation), muddy detail and just overall are drab and lack any visual punch even with shots of some pretty spectacular scenery. The photos my friends took with their older point and shoot and even an iPhone 4s (same subject at same time) were as good, and for the most part, better than what came from this Canon. Based on all the glowing reviews I thought for sure the image quality from this thing was going to blow me away. Wrong!I took a wide variety of shots in both Auto mode, as well Manual mode, where I instituted some of the color override features (like emphasizing red, blue or green, vivid, etc.) as well as other manual adjustments in an attempt to improve the quality. In all cases the color just seemed dull and the resulting images did not represent the vividness or depth of color or detail of the actual scene. Most shots were of gorgeous fall colors in the trees - lots of brilliant reds, yellows and greens, with a perfect clear deep blue sky - perfect day for shooting fall colors. Perhaps something is wrong with the one I purchased (at Costco). I will give it another shot (pun intended) when I go out shooting again in a couple days to see if there is some other adjustment I can make to improve the image quality. But, most likely this will be going back to Costco for a refund or exchange.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOUD Clicking & tapping noise when I shoot videos !!!", "Author": "Zona Films",

The only reason I got this one was because of the NEW 1080 HD video.  My old Canon  780 IS only had 720 HD and I wanted to have the best video I could get in a little  pocket camera.WELL ........So far I HATE this camera!The sound is  WAY  TOO  LOW and very muffled.I never had this problem with my old  Canon ELPH 780IS. The other problem i have with this camera is  the sound  has a  loud  CLICKING & TAPPING  NOISE  that I am getting when I shoot videos!!!The noise  is so bad that it makes it of NO use to me! ----- HEAR THE CLICKING AND TAPPING IN MY VIDEO SHOWN HERE ------(The full length video about this camera is posted on my YouTube channel ....  \"Zona Films\" The only plus for this camera is that it does take wonderful still PHOTOS and the video LOOKS great ... but the SOUND is no good at all for videos!

It is VERY important that the sound is decent for my videos.So far I hear that that I am NOT  alone with this 310 HS noise  problem.which makes me think that this may be a design flaw maybe??I hope not.I will find out soon. I  have contacted Canon and I am sending my camera back to be fixed or replacedas it is still  under warranty.I will leave updates on what happens next with this camera and how Canon treatstheir customers.I DO A LOT OF  PRODUCT REVIEWS AND UNBOXINGS ON YOUTUBEAND MOST OF WHAT I BUY IS FROM  AMAZON GO CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL  FOR MORE  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>  Zona FilmsfromZONA FILMS...................................................................  -------- UPDATE !!!!  --------Oct 7, 2012canon quickly  sent me a replacement  of the same camera ...another 310and that was good of them to do thisI did  sound tests on it and  still AGAINthe clicking noise  is till thereand the audio is  way too weak & muffled ....it is terribleTHERE IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH THIS CAMERA MODEL  WHEN IT COMES TO THE SOUNDif good sound in your videos  matters to you ... then DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL.I  went today  and sold this camera  Canon just sent me and I will use that money toward getting  some other camerasoend of story for me with this cameraI was glad to see it go", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "What happened to Canon?", "Author": "Shutterbug", "ReviewID": "R38Y4H610P5JHX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had this camera now for about a week, pictures come out ok but nothing special.

Perfect, sharp pictures.  I used it to shoot pictures that I used in Google Earth to create 3D buildings.  We were upset when it got lost on a recent trip to Maine, and I found my wife a rebuilt SD850 IS on line, which did not disappoint.I thought that it was a good time to update to a more recent model for myself, and after reading many reviews, I settled on the Canon 310HS, as it had HD movie capabilities and a faster shutter speed.  I was really disappointed on the plastic case, which is terrible after the beautiful metal case of the SD850.  I put in a freshly charged battery and it seemed to work OK for about 2 minutes, after which the camera shut down.  I turned it on again and it lasted about 30 seconds and turned off again.  I turned it on again and then the screen started flashing random colors for about 15 seconds, and shut down again.  After that the camera would not turn on.  I found that the battery was dead.  It took 1.5 hours to charge the battery again.  Then I put the freshly charged battery in again.  The camera ran for about 10 seconds and would not restart.  The battery was dead again.  I bought another battery and it did the same thing, ran for a few seconds and went dead.I sent the camera back to Amazon for a refund.

The auto setting is much smarter than other cameras I have owned in the past, and easily switched on the fly from portrait to fast motion to macro without any additional button presses. It also has some really nice features like blink detection, shutter when smile/wink is detected, slow-mo video capture, and great optical zoom. There are TONS of manual adjustments you can make in 'program' mode (not as many as some higher end compacts, but plenty for a casual user/enthusiast like myself).Where the camera fell short for me was its production quality. I used it 7-8 times over the course of 2 weeks (about 10 pictures each use, different zoom levels but mostly pulled back for regular portrait shots of faces, scenery, etc). Stored in a hard shell case (not possible to accidentally press the power button while inside). A lens error appeared while attempting to power up the camera on a mid-70's day in southern California (where it had previously worked just fine twice that same morning). The lens got stuck in the out/open position, and couldn't retract. Each time I attempted to restart the device (like the instructions asked me to), the lens continued to extend ever so slightly (~1mm) until it was at it's maximum length. Holding the camera close, you can hear some sort of gear/servo repeatedly clicking but it eventually gives up and powers down.This HS 310 branded PowerShot (purple) appears to be from one of Canon's Japanese factories. When I was originally researching which camera to buy, others seemed to suggest that Canon's production quality varied between their Chinese and Japanese factories, and that the Japanese shipments had a better track record. This does not appear to be the case for my camera. :-(I'll be exchanging it for the same model as I really like the camera, but will probably start looking elsewhere if it becomes a repeat offender of breaking down.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot Elph 310 HS", "Author": "SEB", "ReviewID": "R3KCMYSNADHGIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon Powershot Elph 310 HS was an upgrade from the 300 HS.

The menus and display are easier to use on the 310.My biggest problem is with the microphone/audio when making videos.  The speaker appears to be much smaller on the 310, so that playing back any videos on the camera (or even after downloading on a computer) requires the volume to be cranked up significantly.

In pictures the camera looks like it has a nice, metallically finish, but upon touching it it feels like awfully cheap plastic. Not only that, the camera is actually bulkier than my old SD1400, and while I know it has a powerful 8x zoom, I expected the camera to be smaller, not bigger than my older model. The screen and lens casing protrude out of the back and front of the camera and make it quite bulky, so much so that it seems like it would be a slight burden to carry around (if you are used to carrying around a smaller and more well-built camera).When I saw that this camera had a dedicated video button it sounded like a cool feature, however pushing the video button is the only way to record a video; there is no longer a video mode on the camera, only two photo modes (that can be changed by moving the dial on the side of the camera). This is rather irritating to me, as I like to go into video mode in order to set up my shots, but on this camera, even in iFrame movie mode, the only way to record videos is by pressing the video button, which is irritating. I would much rather press the shutter button to start and end video recordings, as it is hard to press the video button without moving the camera, and thereby your videos. The 1080p video recording capability of this camera was what really drew me to it, and, unfortunately, that is what disappointed me the most about this camera. Although the camera lets you zoom in and out while recording, you can hear the lens moving in your final video, which, unless you're making a silent film, makes your videos unusable. You do not just hear a slight noise in your videos, either, but a loud mechanical whir that is very noticeable whenever you zoom in and out. It sounds as if Canon literally put the microphone directly next to the motor that moves the lens back and forth, for the zoom noise is that prevalent and loud in videos.While I did notice that the camera did a good job of focussing during picture-taking, the video noise this camera emits pretty much cancels that positive attribute out. If you are looking for a camera that just takes pictures and not video, however, this would probably be an ok camera for you. But, for someone who takes a lot of videos with their digital cameras, a video mode that creates videos with unusable sound makes the 1080p video the camera records pretty much unusable. In addition to the camera's other problems, the button placement on the side of the camera is a bit awkward (and all the buttons are a bit hard to press), and the \"simplified\" menu makes you go into a menu to delete pictures and videos, as you can no longer just click down to delete things. I am returning this camera and am just going to keep my SD1400, and, if I were you, I would recommend looking at additional cameras before purchasing this model (or checking it out at a local store, that way you can see if you like it before you order it). While this camera is bright and colorful and takes nice pictures, it also feels quite cheap, is overly simplified, is bulkier than older models, and takes videos that might as well be without sound.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Operating Manual", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R28QK91AB61MLN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my Canon Elph, but I am very frustrated that a paper copy of the operating manual is not included.

Even though some understanding of the knowledge in Physics, especially related to optics and computer science, would be helpful to give relevant suggestions, you will never know what you will find out unless you do the experiment (or let others do the experiment); science is modeled to describe how the nature behaves after all. Without hands-on experience, there would be a lot of questions of mine remain unanswered; those doubts were what kept me from giving comment as I did not want to give any answer based on half-truth. Certainly, my background knowledge in Physics/ Mathematics coupled with ongoing research does help a lot to learn from the hands-on experience I got.From the integrated camera of smartphone to the highest-end point-and-shoot camera, high-definition video recording has become increasingly common. Some of users may buy other types of digital camera, such as DSLR, CSC, etc. to take photographs of higher quality. Frankly speaking, users need to have certain level of manual handling or technical knowledge (albeit not much) to operate DSLR or CSC cameras in order to take full advantages of them. On the other hand, smartphone and point-and-shoot cameras are mainly designed for photograph taking with one-click (or few-clicks) away. Higher-end point-and-shoot cameras often offer more customized options to take photograph of better results, other the default \"auto\" options. As the main functionality of a point-and-shoot camera is to take still image, digital cameras or smartphones are often not regarded as the camcorder, which is designed mainly for video recording purposes for the consumers. In this review, I shall examine whether Canon Ixus 230 HS (Powershot Elph 310 HS) can truly be regarded as a good video-recording device.High-definition video is a term to describe the video of certain minimum resolution, which is usually 1280 \u00d7 720 pixels with progressive scan (commonly known as 720p) or 1920 \u00d7 1080 pixels with progressive scan (commonly known as 1080p), with the aspect ratio of 16/9. The truth is that most theatrically-released films are shot with different aspect ratios, which are usually wider than 16/9. For example, 720p video with the aspect ratio of 2.35 means that the resolution is approximately 1280 \u00d7 545 pixels, which have fewer pixels than the videos of the aspect ratio of 16/9; 1080p video with the aspect ratio of 2.35 means that the resolution is approximately 1920 \u00d7 817 pixels. There are also videos of aspect ratios which are \"taller\". For example, 720p video with the aspect ratio of 4/3 means that the resolution is 960 \u00d7 720 pixels; 1080p video with the aspect ratio of 4/3 means that the resolution is 1440 \u00d7 1080 pixels. In short, whenever the different aspect ratio (wider or taller) is used, the resolution is always fewer than the aspect ratio of 16/9.The video resolution describes the maximum graphic information that the video can hold. When it comes to video-recording, there are other factors that would affect the quality of the videos. From the smartphone, to lower-end point-and-shoot camera, to higher-end point-and-shoot camera, saying that it is capable of doing HD-recording is merely saying the video resolution, which is perhaps the only thing in common among different recording devices. How would the camera react with different lighting conditions? How much details (of graphic information) the camera can capture? How close the perceptional colors of the captured video are compared with the real objects? How is the ease of use of the camera? Clearly, the logo of \"HD\" left a lot of questions remain unanswered, which justifies different price point and performance.The reviews made by the editors of CNET UK, TechRadar, and StevesDigicam have answered much of these questions. To me, personally at least, all I need to do is to verify their reports. Those main factors that would affect the eventual image quality include but are not limited to the amount of light signal that can be captured, the percentage of noise, performance under low lightning, etc. In the brief period I used/ tested this camera, I found that the advantages as being pointed out by those reviews are largely true. In short, I like:1. Large numbers of colors which are available in the camera allow more truthful/ realistic photograph.2. Not only the camera can capture/ filter adequate level of light, the noise is being kept at low-level. Noise at low percentage is really pleasing.3. Superzoom is the term used to describe the zoom lens with unconventionally large zoom factor, typically more than 5\u00d7. By having the zoom factor of 8\u00d7, I would say that this camera definitely falls into the category of having superzoom.4. Canon Ixus 230 HS automatically adjusts the ambient light/ flash according to the lighting condition, which works very well. In one occasion, I used it to take a photo of sunset, when the sky was brighter than land; when I tried to focus on the sky, the color around the land was darker (having more noise); when I tried to focus on the land, it adjusted the ambient light/ flash to increase the brightness of the eventual taken photograph.5. It allows me that take photograph at different aspect ratio. The advertised 12.1 MP is referring to the maximum resolution at the aspect ratio of 4/ 3. Personally, I preferred to take photograph at the aspect ratio of 16/ 9, which is the aspect ratio of my screen of the desktop PC. Taking photograph at different aspect ratio would result in the drop of the resolution. I used the largest resolution available for the aspect ratio of 16/ 9, which is 4000 \u00d7 2248 pixels. (it's not exactly 16/ 9)6. When the picture taken was displayed at full size, the \"noise\" can be seen much in low-lighting area; generally, it can be seen as a picture made of large number of square pixels. It looks \"continuous\" at the resolution of 1920 \u00d7 1080 pixels. In other words, the optical system and image sensor has enough resolving power to record still image/ video at 1080p. I usually compressed the image to the resolution of 1920 \u00d7 1080 pixels for archival.7. Video-recording process can be seen as the camera is taking 24 images every second at the resolution of 1920 \u00d7 1080 pixels, assuming the camera is set to record video at 1080p, 24 fps. It's a good way to test the quality of the images taken by this camera. I'm generally satisfied with the image quality.There are several things which the users may need to beware of:1. High-definition video recording consumes a lot more of energy compared with the capturing of still images. In addition to taking images, image processor and software need to compress and encode the video to be stored in the memory card. The writing process requires memory card of higher speed. If you use SDHC memory card, you will need at least class 4 for 720p video and class 6 for 1080p video. The video-encoding process is resource-intensive. H.264 (video codec) is known for its high compression level while retaining high perceptional quality, at the expense of processing power (of CPU/ GPU). Its algorithm is much more complex compared with MPEG 2. H.264 has 18 profiles. This camera uses Baseline Profile (BP), which is relatively simpler compared with Main Profile (MP) or High Profile (HP) but still much more complex than MPEG2. The H.264 High Profile and VC-1 Advanced Profile have been mandated as the supported video codecs for Blu-ray players; H.264 Baseline Profile is more commonly found for below-standard or standard definition streaming videos (such as YouTube). If H.264 Main Profile (MP) were used, the video file may be smaller but such a small device may not have enough energy/ processing power to encode the video. The user may choose to re-encode the video to further compress the video while retaining the video quality. To preserve energy, I usually record video at 720p, 30 fps. I first encode the source video into H.264 Main Profile then VC-1 Main Profile. I use Handbrake to encode the video at constant quality (RF 20), main profile, MKV (file container), and 23.976 fps; I encode the video of H. 264 main profile using Microsoft Expression Encoder 4 at VC-1 Main Profile, VBR Unconstrained, 2Mbps, frame per rate (source), Complex (Video Complexity), 2 B-Frame, Adaptive Motion Match Method and Adaptive Motion Vector Cost. Due to the limitation of hardware and resource-intensiveness of the video encoding process, I typically only encode the video of the maximum length of ten minutes. MKVToolNix allows video files that use MKV (file container) to be split and merged, in addition to adding and removal of audio/ video/ subtitle track. Before encoding the video/ audio, I extract video/ audio track into separate files using MKVToolNix. Microsoft Expression Encoder 4 uses WMV (file container) by default. The VC-1 video file in WMV (file container) can be \"transported\" to AVI (file container) using Format Factory (by selecting `Copy' for video codec). MKVToolNix cannot read WMV but it can read AVI. I also use Format Factory to compress the audio track losslessly at FLAC.2. The video-encoding process may be a little more complex to many people, which may take time to understand and do it successfully. Unless you know someone who can do it for you, video-encoding process allows you keep your precious memory not just on still images but also high-definition videos at smaller file size (reduced cost).3. This camera may do a good job at filtering the noise from the image but not from the audio files. Anyway, the audio track is always engineered for the theatrical release. For a home video, this camera would record unwanted/ unpleasant sound. If you can withstand noises of sound, this camera may be a good choice for home-used video recording device. Basically, it not only amplified the signals (sound) but also the noises (sound). Canon may need to pay more attention to audio engineering.My review is far from exhaustive and is just for reference purposes only. After all said and done, the best way to understand it may be to try it yourself!In a separate blog post, I also wrote about why I chose a point-and-shoot camera instead of other options.
