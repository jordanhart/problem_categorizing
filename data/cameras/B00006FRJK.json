Check the dimensions on this, and then check your pockets. On the other hand, if you don't mind carrying the camera around with you, it will reward you IMMENSELY for the effort.Designed as a reportage camera, the response is incredibly fast. It reminds me of the time I traded in my 133MHz computer for a 2.4GHz. I can't stress enough how fast this thing is. And not only that, but it's PRECISE. The optics are about as crisp as they get, and the CCD captures the image very well.For me, the camera is completely automatic. For later, it has a manual override on everything. For the transition (while I learn more), it has shutter or aperture priority. This includes the best manual focus on any non-SLR digital camera on the market, by the way. It also has a macro focus that allows you to take wide-angle shots within 6cm of the subject. Also, the LCD is a massive 2.5in.With automatic everything, manual overrides on everything, unlimited video (it'll fill your memory card if you let it), crisp and detailed images with no artifacts, a superior LCD viewfinder/replayer, classically gorgeous styling, absolute blazing adjust/focus/write/refresh/everything speed, and all of the other features I haven't time to mention, this is THE camera to have. I shopped for several months, and after learning about this one, my interest in ALL other cameras just disappeared. The ONLY thing I could possibly agree is worth considering is Sony's latest top-end camera. It has excellent Carl Zeiss optics and both 5MP and 5X zoom (which outmatch the Leica by a small margin). It also has infrared night shots, which could be a fun feature to play with. It just lacks the speed of the Leica and costs noticably more (shop around and see). Not to mention it requires memory sticks, where the Leica has SecureDigital memory, which is smaller in size but still as large in capacity and is becoming more prevalent in a number of manufacturers.You don't have to take my word for it, though. Read the rest of the reviews and check Leica's website for really detailed specs. Then shop around for the best price and GET the camera. Enjoy.Addendum:  The more I use the camera, the more I love it.  A few features I've uncovered: Adjustable flash brightness (I illuminated an entire auditorium with it.  Amazing), camera saves preview image with every video for easy reference, manual is VERY comprehensive, Leica partnered with Panasonic (to provide the digital aspects) which in turn means Leica provides optics on Panasonic's cameras - if you don't want to pay this much, check out Panasonic's cams.Finally, I found a great program for organizing and editing pics as well as creating several types of albums.

I was fearful during the purchasing process because I read \"pro\" reviews for this camera that were not favorable.  They complained about severe noise at ISO 200 & 400.  Luckily, I do not use these settings very often, I use a tripod and long exposures for low-light situations if I have to.  The real test occured when I held this camera for the first time--wonderful!  My favorite physical qualities of this piece of art are the well-placed levers (yes I said levers, much like a Leica M), manual focus/settings and magnesium housing.  The large display is very useful. I've gotten many + comments about the camera's superb design. More important than physical prowess though, OPTICS.  This is what sets the Digilux apart from its competitors.  Fast and clear, enough said.One last note, I bought the optional Filter Adapter at a local camera shop...  Ohhh, what I'm willing to pay for Leica quality.  With the adapter screwed on, the lense cap does not fit. This is a minor detail because filters offer protection and you can get an aftermarket cap that fits.  Soon I will add accessories (wide-angle lense, more filters) to increase the camera's photo possibilities.  It's truly first class.", "Date": "May 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good value in a digital camera", "Author": "Kevin Carlson", "ReviewID": "R17VGZNJ7B8NXE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unlike many other digital cameras, the Digilux 1 has little or no perceptible lag between pressing the button and taking the picture, especially if you 'prefocus'.  Another nice feature is the multi-exposure setting, where you can automatically shoot 3 or 5 photos in rapid sequence, varying either the exposure by 1/4 to 1 stop increments, or varying the depth of field using different F stops.  Both approaches give you a chance to pick the best shot after the 'decisive moment' has passed.A negative is that the smallest aperture seems to be F8, which impacts the depth of field available in closeup photos.  You'll also want to get a 256M card, the supplied 64M card holds only about 30 photos at medium compression.", "Date": "April 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "Oh, they shouldn't let novices like myself have such joy.", "Author": "LK", "ReviewID": "R2F76XWPWH2JOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very new to digital cameras (and photography) so my review will focus on ease-of-learning the camera and the way it handles.  I've now had the camera for about a month and have used it almost daily and am extremely pleased overall.I had a minor moment of disappointment when I first got the camera and found it to be larger than I had expected (I hadn't seen one in person and was secretly hoping it would be Canon Elph sized).  I'm over the size thing now, especially since I love how ... the camera looks.  Yes, it's oh-so-retro in style, but when it comes down to it, the Digilux-1 could almost be out of the backdoor of the LOMO factory or something.  But I love it for that.As a person who has no patience to read directions, I found it very easy to figure out what to do in terms of setting up the camera and taking my first pictures.  I was snapping away within 15 minutes.  Because the camera has so many nice adjustments in terms of how yr picture turns out, I find it easier and funner (yes, more fun) to play around with the settings on the camera rather than go for \"perfect\" pictures on the first attempt.Hm, what else.  Oh, transferring pics to the computer (I have Windows XP) was a breeze, no software needed, and god bless USB.  Really now the issue is organizing all the photos I've taken!Lastly-- this camera begs for a case, and not the ugly boring black leather one that Leica has decreed is appropriate for the Digilux-1 (Leica Digilux-1 case has a MSRP of $..., ugh).  I think they could have put a little more thought into the styling and features of a case for this gem of a camera.  So I did a little hunting and I'm going to try one of the Crumpler cases... we shall see...", "Date": "January 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "Top of the Heap", "Author": "G. K. Hutchinson \"grhutchinson\"", "ReviewID": "REGYTC1768XWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Digilux is a real value and wonderful camera for both the digital novice to the seasoned camera buff.  In my opinion the most important thing in any camera is the lens, and in the Digilux has the legendary Summicron.  I've had other several other cameras both digital and 35mm and this lens is a must buy. When matched with Panasonic electronics, we end up with the best of both worlds - the clear eye and great electronic brains.  From an over all value perspective, the Digilux while not inexpensive, is in my opinion a real \"value buy\".I do reccomend that anyone buying this camera be prepared to invest several hours reading the manual. In order to unlock the massive potential of the camera, one must plow through the manual initially and over time.  The investment is worth it to unlock the amazing things this camera can do (too numerous to list).Lastly I'd invest in a USB card reader, buy an extra flash card and keep this beautiful camera (it feels great in your hands) protected with a good case, otherwise enjoy!", "Date": "April 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "The Absolute Best Digital Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3JO06A7CUPO16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simple, direct, point and shoot. When I first handled this camera, I was struck by the boxy Retro shape. How unlike the rest of the digital camera field. The technical instrumentation is straight forward, the view area of 2.5 inches, the largest available was a selling point for this myoptic photographer. Having read some very positive professional photographic reviews and being an owner of a Leica film camera, I made the purchase solely based on Leica's reputation. I was not disappointed. Everyone who saw the  first batch of photographs I took were astounded by the image quality and detail. The high quality Leica Vario-Summicron lens justifies the higher price. Having previously owned and used Nikon and Canon digital cameras which seem to get more complicated with every new model, this is the one I prefer over all others. There is no comparison when it comes to the final result.", "Date": "December 15, 2002"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Pictures are the reason.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RBLCTCO0379CV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The true measure of this camera is the quality of the pictures it produces. Here's my take on the reasons this camera takes such stunning shots (and is worth the cost):1. Button speed. You will actually capture the moment you are looking for with this camera. Most digital cameras take bland pictures because, well, what they are taking a picture of is not interesting and the moment has passed. With this camera your eye will tell you when the picture is right, and blam! You'll have it captured.2. Lens quality. The blacks are blacker, the whites are whiter, the colors are richer. Things are sharper. Nobody can deny Leica produces top-quality lenses.3. Feel good controls. The camera body is Magnesium and feels fantastic. With it in your hands, it has a tendancy to outclass it's wearer, like a suit that's a bit too expensive for the occasion. An interesting thing happens, you will try to take better pictures. Don't underestimate this effect. Due to the excellent simplicity of the controls, when you do try to become an expert, you actualy can because the camera doesn't get in the way or make you squint endlessly at onscreen menus to change settings.These are three very simple things that combine to make a very unique camera. I don't believe you'll find all of these things combined in any other digital camera. Some have said there's a strange pattern or pixelation when zoomed WAY in on images on screen. Two responses:1. You aren't going to spend any time zoomed in on pictures on your computer when looking at them in a normal manner. At display resolutions, these pictures are as clear or clearer than any from Canon, or Sony comparable models.2. This *may* actually be intentional on Leica's part. If you print out a picture from this camera, it is always stunning, even at full size or larger. Some liken this to a stochastic (look it up) printing process. Whatever the case, find a print sample your self from this camera, there's no denying the overall effect more artistic and is a cut above simiar competitive brands.I have had zero issues with this camera since ordering it from Amazon 8 months ago. My only complaint is that the Digilux 2 is even better...", "Date": "February 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "After a year of use ...", "Author": "Dr. Scott Hunter", "ReviewID": "R14024DZM7T3RG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, I admit that I am a sucker for the Leica name, but hey, it has meant quality and incredible optics for a very long time, so I had little difficulty choosing this camera last year when I decided to finally go digital.  After one year of use, I have nothing but praise for this camera.  Although I pine a bit for the Digilux 2, I am not ready to trade my Digilux 1 in and pay the premium.  As a digital rangefinder, with excellent automatic and manual aspects, I have been able to satisfy both sides of my hobby: the snapshot photographer and the advanced hobbiest artist.  The pictures I produce using this camera are stunning; the colors dense and true, and their ability to be manipulated in Photoshop a breeze.

They have missed their mark only a couple of times when they lent their name to inferior products.  The Digilux1 is the redeemer.  Alittle more bulky and a little more costly than competing products, but certainly, ounce for ounce, the best point and shoot digital out there.  On high resolution a blow up of 11 x 14 competes with most quality film cameras.The design is somewhat retro, but so is everything else these days.  The processor is fast, the screen is big.

Aesthetics apart ('big', 'boxy' come to mind) this is NOT the camera you should go for if you want anything beyond an ISO of about a 100 -- and this is not coming from a point-and-click amateur. Yes, the manual controls are charming but if alternative brands offer me a better device (primarily, better pics, i.e.) with a lighter price tag, I begin to question. WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE DIGILUX:  (1) Very, very fast response times in its class. This alone could be a dream criterion for some of you.(2) A spacious monitor on the cam, bigger than matching Olympus, Canon or Nikon offerings.(3) The much vaunted manual controls, no need for reflex cams.(4) The Summicron lens, which leads to good pictures if the only alternative you have owned is a Sony entry-level point and shoot. If you have ever worked with a Nikon D100 or a Canon G3 (or above) then the quality difference is minimally incremental.  WHAT'S NOT: (1) The price tag. For me, just the name doesn't cut it.(2) Sub-par battery life.(3) .mov format for the movies? Why?(4) Think about where you'll be getting your tech support. It's not very easy.(5) The reference guide is a pain to comprehend.(6) A lean 2x optiocal zoom, which is also a bit deceiving - the imaging chip is so small, you can almost NEVER achieve background blur for portraits, or any other form of professional photography.(7) Where's the noise reduction that is so COMMON with other competitors?(8) A hood for the lens would've been nice.(9) WB when using a flash is too bluish green.(10) Ugly body (ok, this is subjective) -- almost seems tailor made for big German hands.(11) Where's RAW? SUMMARY: I know a Leica when I see one. If you're looking for a digi version of the M6, this isn't it. I wonder why other reviewers would rate a product based on the halo of its overall brand. I'd wait for a revised version of this offering from Leica, their lens is worth the wait.

It is rock solid and it takes nice pictures. It is true that there are some noise problems in iso 200 and 400, but hey then I just use iso 100 for indoor shots.
