The lack of buttons and the sweet touch screen makes for an elegant package.  I haven't tested most of it's capabilities, however.BUT, this camera inexplicably has no Auto-off function.  The sliding cover acts as a switch, and if you accidentally leave it open it enters a standby mode, but then DOESN'T SHUT OFF!  It slowly drains the battery completely.  I keep it in a case and didn't notice I had left it open, only to twice find a dead battery when I really needed a camera.  And you can't pop in a spare.  I think every digital camera I've owned had this feature.  It simply doesn't make sense to leave it off a relatively expensive camera, especially since it's so easy to leave it open unintentionally.And on the subject of that sliding cover/switch, using it creates several parallel scratches on the front of the camera- which takes away some of the elegance I mentioned.  Not a real problem, but I still wonder why Nikon created a system destined to deface itself.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Picture Quality", "Author": "D. Grimes", "ReviewID": "R1HBM7FULUHS1S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After a lot of research, and a top recommendation from Consumer Reports, I purchased this camera for my wife.  Bottom line:  I do not recommend this cameras.It had all the features I was looking for: good optical quality, thin and compact, lightweight, fast start-up time and recovery, a fixed lens (doesn't protrude out) with a good optical zoom, and it even came in red.  For these qualities, it is successful.Where it is not successful is giving a decent picture.  It exudes several poor behaviors:-Inconsistant focus.  3 out 5 are way out of focus (optical focus, not image blur) and 1 out of 5 is actually sharp.-This camera has a very slow shutter speed in low light (lots of streaking).  It must have a poor image stabilizer, too.-The flash is very inaccurate and inconsistent.  No two shots are the same, even if taken right after each other.-Most shots are too bright.  I must use exposure compensation always, which often resets back to 0.-The video is often very blurry and the focus stays fixed.  One must stop and start the video to get it to refocus.-The slide to turn it on slides out in my wifes purse and turns on, depleting the battery.-The lens is in a poor location; my wife keeps covering up the lens with her finger.-Low light pictures are almost unusable.-The panoramic mode does not process properly so there is lots of ghosting/double imagery.-Very grainy in dark areas.-The camera remains on and the battery will go dead if the USB cable is plugged into the camera but removed from a computer after downloading pictures.-The charger form factor takes up too much space on a power plug.-The color balance is either way too warm or way too cold. It doesn't seem to be able to adapt to shade properly.-The OLED touchscreen easily scratches.-Touching menu buttons is often read as wanting to take a picture, so it does. Lots of deletes.-Seems to be losing videos.-I don't get \"thumbnails\" of the pictures in Windows 7 x64 folders.I thought Nikon made good cameras but not so on this model.  I have a Kodak 3 MP camera from 2002 that consistently yields better pictures than this camera.  I just went back and reviewed a bunch of pictures from a staycation and found very few keepers.

It was in top 3 of it class. I do not know how and who made the test but according to my experience:Pros:Good quality of pictures.That's about it....Cons:1. The objective is located in top corner and if you would not hold camera properly -  you could face a lot of \"finger shapes on your picture\", especially if you would like to take quick shot.2. The cover which you have to slide to shut the camera when it is open located too close to the shot button, and when you are trying to close the camera you most probably will make a picture of the floor first :).3. The screen is too fragile. It cracked after several weeks not heavy use at all. Just stopped working. Then I noticed a small crack on the screen. This probably the cause, but I do not know. I was on vacation abroad and was not able to return it according to return policy .  Now sending it to Nikon for repair.

Thereafter, you will discover that it cannot correctly pick up yellow tones with hues of brown (it will turn them into a bright orange tone), and that it overcorrects skins colour with reddish hues. it fairs miserably when you shoot landscape and part of the image is very bright, where it then bleaches out the white fields to capture darker areas, if you move it a millimeter and add some darker area, it give a more accurate picture.

Most people may destroy it right away upon use, as it takes proficiency and wherewithal to use it, it is perhaps not designed for morons. Easy to smudge the lens right away, if one is not careful.First of all, the image quality is not superb. There is some fuzziness on the edges of the images, not as bad as with other cameras, but mostly you get what you pay for. I do my daily photo log with this, not serious photography, and so I have little worry from theft or breakage as it is cheap and easily replaceable. It carries well with a soft case in my pockets, and has been dropped with a soft case onto concrete from three feet up, no problem.It turns on and off by sliding the cover, which can be done with one hand. Touch operation is fine, fast, and reliable. Battery life is good, I can shoot for days without a new battery, maybe 500 stills. Full HD is the winner, here. I like it so much, it is the preferred camera for my video. The slim design means that I can rubber band it to the front of my rear view mirror on my car, with an object stuffed to point it ahead due to the alignment of the car rear view mirror, taking up little viewing obstruction to the driving, far less than the 5\" square allowed by law (CA). A 64 GB SDXC card allows for 29 minutes at a time to run video, with some 8 hours total to store. It does get hot, though.The lens works fine, with no big loss of quality as with other cameras when zoomed in. I love the modest choices of zoom, with wide angle to sufficient for my purposes as far as telephoto. There is nothing to extend when zoomed, it's all in the camera body.I like it that older battery models are used, so I can use my former camera to charge up the batteries, as they are compatible. You may wish to have an extra battery or few available, as with video running, the battery does go out. Nice to have some beep warning when the battery is low, but with music players only still.Most or all of the settings are done by the touch screen, so you need to have nimble fingers. This is not for the inept or fumblers. The interface is obvious for Nikon users, but those unfamiliar with symbols and icons, unable to learn, should stay away from such cameras. It is sensitive, so often I cause a shot just by inadvertent handling of the camera when active, and to erase takes a couple taps. It responds instantly and precisely, no problem about that. I'll trust my treasured vacation photos and video to this camera.

The color as shown is exactly the same in person, bright purple. It takes very fast photos as soon as you click the button or touch the screen. The photos/videos come out so crisp and clean. This camera can take really good photos in a dark room so there is no issues with having dark photos unless you set it to do so. Battery life great especially if you don't keep in on the whole time. My ONLY two minor issues with this very cute camera is that you have to make sure and shut it off and watch your hands and body because its a very sensitive touch screen. You will have random photos of your nose, ceilings and just crazy stuff because me and who ever takes the photos will always hit the touch screen. Also if you don't mind a lot of silver scratches on the camera from sliding the lens back and fourth. This is surely a great everyday camera to buy.
