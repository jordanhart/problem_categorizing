Battery life, flash charging time, image processing time, and poor design all conspire to make this a frustrating item.Battery Life:  The only time this camera works as it should (i.e., flash charges in a reasonable time, LCD can be used, etc.) is when used with superior (read \"expensive\") batteries.  There are no rechargeable power options, and when sending photos to your PC, do not attempt to use any power cord but the one HP sells (for a hefty price) or else you run the very real risk of frying the camera.Design/Ergonomics:  The camera's design is very poorly executed.  It is difficult to hold the camera steadily without placing your fingers over the lens; consequently one is forced to hold the camera in an awkward way.  The viewfinder is not well aligned, and has no depth (i.e., your view out the viewfinder can change a good deal as you slide your eye from one side to the other).  Finally, the trigger button has a poor feeling--it's requires that you press down too long.Flash Charging:  As noted above, with anything but the best batteries, the flash will take a ridiculous amount of time to charge up:  upto 25 or 30 seconds.  I've missed many a photographic opportunities waiting for the flash to warm up.  Furthermore the camera's default setting upon powering on is with the flash enabled, and changing that setting takes several seconds too.Images:  This camera does produce good images in most light (although it tends to overplay reds in low light, and underplay reds outdoors).  However the time required to process an image between one snapshot and the next is sometimes somewhat slow.Price:  Price is the only real strong point for this unit.  In retrospect I would have opted up for something more, especially considering that the price of digital cameras seems to be dropping $50 or so every six months.", "Date": "October 23, 2001"}, {"Title": "How to Conserve Battery life", "Author": "Matthew M.

I have seen many reviews on this camera, most of which are not too favourable. But then there is always a price-performance curve and this camera, for me, fits right in the sweet spot.Firstly, to dispell some myths- Battery LifeYes, this camera eats batteries for lunch. I get only 30 or so photos per set of quality alkalines (with instant preview on and a couple of transfers). Despite what HP says, I use rechargable NiMH batteries (1600mAH) and it works great, I get over 80 photos. My advice, get a rechargable- Photo qualityThe quality of the photos are pretty good to me atleast. Dont bother with the low and medium quality. I would recommend to get more memory (I have 128Mb) and use the high quality. It is not worth it to capture in high compression mode.Note that this is not some cheap camera (like many others in the market). Comparison to the film camera, I would place it along with the regular autofocus canon/minolta brand. Lower than the SLRs and the high end cameras, but better than the regular $50 camerasThe photos are a bit over/under exposed at times. This is due to the single point metering. I always enhance the photos using PSP or some other tool. Increase contrast, clarify and adjust gamma and you have high quality photos that beat or come close to the pros.I have taken a lot of photos using my Cannon EOS and scanned them at 600dpi (8MPixels) but the quality of this camera easily beats the scanned images (at much lower resolution too).- SoftwareThe included software sucks. Just use the included driver. I found it is much easier to use the driver rather than a CF reader. You only lose the EXIF information, but it is not worth missing the thumbnails. Use PSP or any other imaging tool to capture and enhance- MemoryThe included 4MB sucks. Go get 64 or 128MB (it costs only $50 for the 128MB). Although the camera starts with 196 photos in fine quality, it is a guess, I get over 250 photos easily (perhaps my photos are more compressible)- FlashIncluded flash is not too good. I takes long to charge and it is on by default. I would discourage you from taking pictures in the dark. Fill-in flash is not too good either. This is a camera for well lit conditions. As with any CCD, low light results in grainy pictures- ConstructionIt is a BIG camera, not for your regular pockets. But for $100 what do you expect.Finally,I would like to see more features, but for the price, I must say, Im impressed. I have retired my film camera and gone fully digital. Maybe in a couple of years, I might get a 3 or 4MP camera, but for now, this camera is good enough for all my photos", "Date": "September 6, 2001"}, {"Title": "Use some cation", "Author": "Daniel Hoenisch", "ReviewID": "R1AGC2H0T1E4RW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera last night.

Tracy \"Downtown LA cubicle dweller\"", "ReviewID": "R2BQ0USZ78N60K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "General Opinion of Camera-------------------------I am a gadget guy. I use this camera more than I was using my old 35 mm autofocus camera. I like being able to snap pics and email them right away. The quality is good enough for the internet and it is fun for my 9 year old to use. For people who are perfectionists, don't get this camera. Save your money and spend the extra hundreds for a 2.1 megapixel with an optical zoom. I, however, am having fun taking pics around work and on the weekends and rushing home to edit them in Photoshop. If you like gadgets and want to get in on digital photography and don't have much money, I recommend the camera:This is an autofocus camera, and as with all such cameras, you have to tinker with the focus to make sure your subject is focused right. It just takes a bit of practice.The digital zoom is a waste of time. Don't get excited. You get the same effect by taking the pic regular and then zooming in Photoshop later. BUT the macro is cool. I have gotten some cool closeup shots with it.The quality of the pics seems to be the same as with a normal film-based camera as far as color and exposure stuff.A lot of people have said the batteries get terrible life. This is not my experience. I have found that if I keep the camera off unless I am using it, as well as not using the LCD except for quick peeks at important shots to make sure things are okay, I can get many, many pics of a set off batteries in superfine mode. I am on around 400 total pics so far and on my third set of AA Duracell Ultras. Some have said that rechargeables work, and others have reported their CCD getting fried. I am not taking a chance. One more thing: when the camera is done with the batteries and can't take a pic, the batteries still have power and are worth holding on to for extras for flashlights, radios, etc... don't just chuck them.Issues------You definitely do get a parallax issue with the camera in certain situations (what you see in the viewfinder is not what the pic ends up being). This is not a big deal and is the same with all non SLR cameras. I have just gotten used to the tendency of the camera and compensate for it.The biggest design flaw is the on/off switch. It is way too easy to flip on. I am sure my batteries would last even longer if the off switch were to stay off.The second biggest flaw is that there is nothing protecting the lens. Well, the lens is behind a plastic clear covering, but still, you scratch the plastic covering,that's it, you are screwed.Tips for newbies considering buying this camera-----------------------------------------------It is REALLY important for those thinking of getting ANY digital camera to understand that you NEED to get extras that cost you more than you are expecting:1) You need to get a compact flash card with much bigger memory because the pictures are usually not going to make you happy unless you are using the superfine mode, and when you are using the superfine mode, you can only get around 10 pictures on the included 4mb card.2) You need to get an AC adapter to use whenever possible to spare your batteries. You should use the AC adapter when transferring pics to your computer unless you buy a SanDisk or similar card reader (see below) instead. Also, you need the AC adapter to use when reviewing your pics on an LCD when possible, or when inside, so you can snap away with flash and not burn your batteries.3) You need to get a compact flash reader like SanDisk. I use SanDisk. I prefer this to the included software because I can just drag the pics to my pic folder very quickly and open them up in Protoshop for processing. It is much simpler than having to hook the USB up to the camera and it saves your batteries.All this stuff will end up costing you [extra] bucks.

Several other reviews have advised using rechargeable batteries, but in fact, that's a very bad option with this model. The user manual doesn't explain why, but on page 47 it says \"do not use rechargeable batteries.\" I researched this a little - rechargeable batteries get too hot, putting the camera's innards at risk of melting.  More importantly, any use of rechargeable batteries will void the service warranty. A voided service warranty would be bad under any circumstances, but it's especially bad in this case, because this particular camera is more likely to break than many others; there is a bug in its  software.There are two ways to delete pictures from the CF card. You can use the camera itself, or you can use your PC when you have the camera connected. The bug comes into play if you use your PC to delete pictures - you run the risk of \"toasting\" the camera's firmware. \"Toasting\" sounds bad, doesn't it? It is indeed very bad - the cost of repairing a \"toasted\" camera is much greater than the original price of the camera. (Meaning greater than the price of the camera when it was sold new two years ago.)  Cameras under the service warranty are simply replaced, but if the service warranty has expired or is void, the customer must pay.This is a well-known defect; in fact, it is one of the most-discussed problems involving the HP 215 on HP's \"Support Forums.\" The original post dates back to September 19, 2001.I was fortunate; my camera was still under warranty when it broke.  I had an extremely difficult time with HP customer service, but eventually I did convince them to send a replacement.The replacement camera is adequate, but that's about it.  The on/off switch is poorly designed.  It takes a delicate touch to properly turn the camera off, and I've lost count of the number of times I've accidentally left it on and returned to find the batteries dead.The focus & shoot function is aggravating - to \"focus\" you must gently depress the button half way, and then you must wait for a signal before you can actually take the picture.Judging the camera functioning as it was designed, I'd have given it 2 1/2 stars.

I have outfitted it with a 64 MB CF card, and use a card reader rather than software/cable to upload the pictures. I am pleasently surprised with the image quality, and over all performance. Sometimes pictures come out too dark, or the camera focuses on something I don't intend, but if you're used to using automatic cameras rather than manuals that should be acceptable to you. Please notice that the lens is over on the extreme left of the camera, it even sticks out a little past the body of the camera. This will be bad for some people and good for others. My girlfriend is left handed, and everytime she touches the thing she wraps her paws over the lens. I however am right handed, and have a very long nose. With other cameras in the past I have had difficulty framing shots because my nose would be pressed into the back of the camera, this would move the viewfinder away from my eye, skew the view, and decrease the accuracy of my pictures. Now this camera is placed next to rather than in front of my nose, so I have no problem at all with this, this has been a particular delight of this camera's design. So far I only have three complaints, depressing the shutter to take a picture is a slightly peculiar affair... It has a half-depressed button function for setting the focus, and light metering (nice feature for those of us used to manuals), the problem is that this button press feels like it ought to be the complete depress. It's hard to know sometimes how hard to depress the button or how long in each step, but I'm sure I will get the hang of it. There are two more important complaints I have... no lens cap! There's nothing protecting my camera's eyeball! Do not drop this camera, do not set it anywhere, do nothing but store it in a lined camera bag or you will risk damaging the camera. No rechargeable batteries. According to the manufacturer rechargeables will damage the electronics. For many people the reason to buy a digital camera is to save money on film, and processing. You wont do that with this camera, you will spend almost the same amount on batteries. I am satisfied with the camera, but will be certain that the next digital camera I buy (probably 2-5 years from now) will support rechargeables, have more manual options, and have a lens cap.

Picture quality is reasonably good, some of the features are handy.  The camera itself is lightweight, and easy to use.  It's really a nice, expensive toy for the first-time digital camera owner, or a person uses cameras infreqently.If you're planning to use the camera more often, however, you will need to buy a few things to make it worth your while. Battery life is about 20 pictures if you're careful about not using autopreview, so get the AC adapter. If you want printable-quality pictures, the 4MB card that comes with the camera isn't going to cut it, so you'll need to buy at least a 64 meg card. The software that ships with it (Arcsoft PhotoImpression)is miserably bad, so if you don't already own PhotoShop or some other program that reads from digital cameras, you'll probably want to invest in something like that.The one that really burns me, however, is that (as packaged) this camera does NOT work with Windows XP.

The camera lacks manual control in regards to white balance, aperture, and shutter speed, but does offer 4 flash modes, (Auto, Auto w/ Red Eye Reduction, Fill, and No Flash) that help to improve low-light shooting, a category in which the camera does well in an outdoor setting.  The camera has some color balance issues in indoor shooting, a common digital problem, but those are minor. Outdoor shots are fantastic, and are acceptable for printing up to an 8x10.Interface-The HP 215 is a beginner camera, and the interface reflects this. The camera is very simple to use, and nobody should really have any problems with it. The computer hookup via USB is simple, and the program pops up automatically. A very nice physical design, except the method used to turn on the LCD is a tad unusual, but easy to get used to.Features-The features on this camera are good for the price range. 2x digital zoom, which is really enlarging and cropping, helps you get a closer look, albeit at a lower quality. The 4 flash modes are good, and the addition of a macro lens for close up shots (I.E. butterflies, wrappers, cards, etc.) is a nice feature. The viewfinder is slightly off, but the LCD is extremely accurate, but uses battery life. Three quality modes are given: good, very good, and excellent and they really don't affect quality as much as size. An 8 MB Compact Flash card is included with the camera, which is sufficient in the Good quality mode.Battery Life-Many single this camera out for having poor battery life, but it is a widespread problem in the digital market not unique to this camera. In order to capture an image, a digicam uses far more power then a film camera due to the all-electronic components. However, HP not allowing the usage of rechargeable batteries is the single greatest flaw of this camera. The reason? The camera isn't equipped to deal with the discharge from a rechargeable. Usage of them will void the warranty, so it is not something to take likely. I took the risk that the camera wouldn't break and used NiMH rechargeable, and have never had any problems, but you should be advised to remove the batteries if the camera won't be used for an extended period. The rechargeable lasted me through a day of shooting, but a set of alkaline batteries will last about 30 shots with extensive LCD use, which is below the industry average. My advice: Use rechargeables, and be careful with the camera.Price-Well priced, below average for the megapixel range.To sum up, the 215 is an excellent choice for a beginner camera that takes great shots.

I had seen the model before in another store, but never really thought much about it. Now that I did some research on it, including reading these other reviews, I realized that this was a WAY better camera than the Kodak. So, on Christmas, I opened up the box, and I saw a camera, a CD, a USB cable, a wrist strap, batteries, and some instructions. On top, there was a pamphlet titled \"quick sucess guide\". It took me through the setup process, and in about 2 minutes, I took my first picture. I was impressed with the results--it came out great. Now I've had the camera for a couple of days, and I'm still very much impressed with it. The quality & resolution are great, and at the highest resolution, it makes even good 8x10s. Tip: for all but your most important shots, use fine resolution, you can hardly notice the difference from the higher one. It's also very simple, just flick it on, and press the button! After you're done taking pictures, plug it into your computer, and it automatically downloads your pictures. The one thing is I recommend getting a bigger memory card; I got a 16 MB one... This will hold 43 picturs in fine quality mode.

After taking several shots you can then review them in thumbnail mode which is really neat, zoom in on the shots and dispose of unwanted ones.

I've had the camera 4 days thats all! I know it is going to work well. People always complain about it being a battery sucker yes it is, bat all digital cameras are! off of a set of plain duracells I get 40+ pictures w/o flash and w/o instant preveiw.people hate that they can't use rechargables, so I never liked using them anyways! The two step button for taking the picture get a clue it's a smart idea! press it down halfway to focus, then when the green light goes press it all the way down to take the picture! The flash is a bit of a hasle but it is bareable. on the LCD above the preveiw screen there is the flash icon, it blinks when it is charging. The camera stores imagaes off in JPEG format on a dos compatable CompactFlash card. Lexar Media makes some really good mem cards, and they are USB enabled! they have this USB adaptor called a Jumpshot that when you plug it in and plug the memory in you can go to \"my computer\" and click on it as if it was a hard-drive! you dont need the stupid software. I'v own there other cameras, a Casio QV-10, a mustek VDC-300, and a HP Photosmart 318. given the 215 is not as good as the 318, but it does have macro. so I can be 4 inches away and get a good picture!

I didn't remember reading anything about not being able to use them with this camera.2. Viewfinder: Not very accurate.  Things were off a bit to the right or left, or the top of the subject I was taking was cut off.  I would have to take or \"waste\" shots just to get is right. Using the LCD as a viewfinder might be a bit more accurate, but it's like watching a slow motion movie!3. Picture quality: On basic it was just that.  the HP c200 is the camera I borrowed from my folks.  I'm not sure if it's an older model but even at basic quality the pictures were great.

Para ser honesto, en primera instancia decidi comprarme la nueva Sony Cybershot P30, sin embargo, al ver el precio de esta HP C215 como que le dude, y como no si me iba a ahorrar mas de 100 dolares!Lo unico que me importo fue tomar el cuenta la resoluci\u00f3n, y dado que ambas son de 1.3 MP decidi darle la oportunidad a la HP. Simplemente, esta camara cumple con su cometido: tomar fotos! y para el precio que se paga por ella yo creo que es una buena adquisici\u00f3n, sobre todo para aquellos que apenas se adentran en el pasatiempo de la fotografia.Esta camara cuenta como quiera con caracteristicas que pueden ser de mucha utilidad, tales como enfoque automatico, flash con reducci\u00f3n de ojos rojos, timer de 10 segundos (para cuando no hay quien te pueda tomar una foto!) una pantalla de 1.8 pulgadas a color (para apuntar al momento de tomar una foto o tener una vista previa de las que ya tomaste) y un zoom de 2x, que si bien no es tan impresionante como el de 6x de la Sony Cybershot, si es de utilidad para enfocar objetos a distancia.El uso de la C215 es de lo mas sencillo. Me tomo alrededor de 45 minutos el poder dominar la camara en sus funciones basicas, y para nada soy un experto en fotografia. Lo mejor del caso es que los menus son accedidos mediante una \"rueda\" similar a la de un mouse, que tambien funciona como bot\u00f3n para seleccionar la opci\u00f3n deseada. Por cierto, los menus son multilenguaje, estando disponible el espa\u00f1ol.La camara puede ser conectada a una PC mediante conexi\u00f3n USB (cable incluido) para poder bajar tus fotos y publicarlas o compartirlas. Una vez que instalas el driver correspondiente podras tener tus fotos en tu PC de una manera rapida. El software incluido te servira solo para poder bajar tus fotos de la camara, y aunque un editor de fotos se provee, este no tiene para nada el poder de un Microsoft Photodraw. Al tomar fotos, estas son almacenadas en una tarjeta de memoria. Una de 4 megas se incluye en el paquete. El detalle es que solo caben alrededor de 7 archivos de alta calidad. Una tarjeta adicional de 32 megas es recomendada para poder tener un numero de fotos considerable.Los contras de esta camara? Pues en primera instancia la cuesti\u00f3n de las baterias, utiliza 4, y se las acaba rapidamente, aunque la verdad es que practicamente todas las camaras digitales son \"gastonas\" de baterias. Lo recomendado para ahorrar energia en estas es no utilizar de mas la pantalla LCD. Una opci\u00f3n es que compres un recargador de baterias, que aunque en el instructivo te comentan que no lo uses sin ninguna explicaci\u00f3n, mucha de la gente que aqui da su opinion de la camara a utilizado pilas recargables sin problema. Al momento de escribir esta critica no he utilizado este tipo de baterias, pero si las adquiri de antemano.El dise\u00f1o de la camara es convencional y poco moderno.En conclusi\u00f3n puedo decirte que la HP PhotoSmart C215 es una camara que recomiendo ampliamente para aquellos que la requieren para las fotos familiares, de reuniones, fiestas o viajes y no para aquellos que buscan una camara para fotos de alto nivel. Mucha de la gente que aqui da su opini\u00f3n se expresa mal de la camara por esperar mas lo que que en verdad te puede ofrecer, pero si eres realista y solo la necesitas para lo que es sin pedir muchos lujos, esta es una gran opci\u00f3n para ti a un precio por demas competitivo.", "Date": "September 3, 2001"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "2x digital zoom lens with autofocus\nIncluded 4 MB CompactFlash memory card holds up to 36 images\nConnects to PCs via USB port\n1.3-megapixel CCD creates 1,280 x 960 images for prints up to 4 by 6 inches\nIncludes auto flash with red-eye reduction; 4 AA batteries included", "Name": "Hewlett Packard PhotoSmart 215 1.2MP Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CE3YCQRPL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000051YGF"}}
