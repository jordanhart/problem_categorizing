It's been online over 3 weeks with no issues whatsoever. Works perfectly in multiple browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome), camera apps (like Blue Iris, ZoneMinder), VLC, and Android apps (like IP Cam Viewer).This is my 6th Foscam camera -- the other 5 were wireless ones, and while one of the wireless died, I'd still buy more -- because you can't beat the value.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works Great", "Author": "La'Maze Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1B7K88BYUYOE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had experience with Trendnet's PTZ cameras, and for the money, these are just as good and much cheaper.  Relatively good video day and night.  I like this particular model because it can be powered with a POE switch without any additional injectors and splitters.  Just the switch and the ethernet cable.  That and I prefer wired cameras to wireless ones anyway.  I paired this with a Synology DiskStation Synology DiskStation 2-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage DS212+ (Black) and I'm able to view and move the camera via their mobile app.  I'm able to view my cameras from anywhere now.  Great value camera for home or office!", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Failed to work right out of the box", "Author": "E. Schwimmer", "ReviewID": "R2UB3W0239KH6O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this webcam to replace an ethernet-cabled Foscam FI8918W, which had started failing inexplicably after 6 months of use.  The FI8918W would stop responding to network traffic (HTTP,ICMP, etc) after an average of 4 hours online (although it's time before failure would vary between 10 minutes and 8 hours).I tried everything I could think of to isolate the problem: performed a hard reset, changed IP address, switched power adapters, switched cat5 cables, changed the ethernet port it was plugged in to.  I even cabled the webcam directly to my monitoring server (running Zoneminder) with a crossover cable.  Nothing changed the rate of failure experienced by the FI8918W.I went so far as to capture the network traffic travelling to and from the camera (via a mirrored switch port and wireshark).  Nothing suspicious could be seen in the traffic patterns.  One moment the camera is working, the next it was unresponsive.Trying to return the camera directly to Foscam was a joke.  They wanted me to get an RMA # via the vendor I bought it from, who wanted me to return it in the long-since-recycled original packaging.I purchased the Foscam FI8918E in the vain hope that the FI8918W was just a lemon.  However this new camera started exhibiting the EXACT SAME BEHAVIOR as soon as I had unboxed it.  Both cameras are Foscam originals (not clones) with Foscam serial numbers printed on their undersides.Foscam technical help (tech3@foscam.com) was equally unhelpful this time around.  They suggested I \"try another port on router\" and \"hard reset camera\".  Failing that, I was once again directed to \"contact reseller for a RMA#\".  Thank god the camera failed within 30 days and that Amazon has such a liberal return policy, otherwise I would have been stuck with another useless hunk of plastic.Foscam: Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Never again.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent option for baby monitor with no wifi", "Author": "R. Grimshaw", "ReviewID": "R2XISAENPVMCUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were (highly) concerned about placing a camera in our infant son's bedroom that would be blasting him with Wifi or other communications radiation.  We live in an apartment and it was a short job to by some ethernet cable, run it along the base board and up the wall with a cable cover, and mount this to the wall.  If you don't want to run a power cable too, this camera can be powered over ethernet, which is awesome frankly, but you do have to buy a PoE-capable switch or router.  They aren't expensive, but we didn't need to do it.  FWIW, we should have mounted it upside down like it is supposed to be mounted, for greater range, but its swivel range is so good even in the vertical dimension that we can use it just fine.  The IR is great for night time, and can be turned off when you don't need it (some people worry about hurting kids eyes with IR, but even if you do you can just turn it off most of the time).  The web interface is great and can be easily figured out by babysitters and nannies.  The web interface isn't so awesome on mobile devices, in that I find I often have to sign back in, but that's not a problem since on both Android and iOS (we use an original iPad), the very popular \"IP Camera\" app supports this model and comes in an ad-supported or paid version.  If you're looking to record, I can't speak to how well that would work with normal, off the shelf freeware, but I use a Synology NAS and the Surveillance Station supports this model as well so I can record how often he moves, if Grandma is putting him down like I asked, etc (after telling her I'm doing so, of course).Great, great product, great price, buy this if you want a baby or pet monitor without WiFi or other radio comms.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Craig", "ReviewID": "RY1LKS1S8U0RG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera and exactly what I needed.

The model Foscam FI8910E has POE and the IR filter that corrects the color, for a few dollars more.  Other than that, the camera works well and the POE seems to be 802.3af compliant. I am glad that Foscam is starting to make POE cameras since I have many of them already on POE networks in my home, office and truck.
