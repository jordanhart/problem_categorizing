The first is order this camera and either the MMF-3 (needed to shoot 4/3 lenses on the EM1) or the  FL-300R at the same time and get reimbursed for the cost of the accessory.  The second is order the EM1 and the 12-40mm and get $200 back.  Both of these promotions can be used with one camera purchase.  I have put the links in the comments section.If I were only allowed to own one camera but could choose any camera I wanted in the world, the EM1 would be the camera I would choose (The GX7 would be the next if the EM1 was not available).  This camera is an almost faultless camera that is a real joy to hold and use.  Oh, it also makes amazing photographs.  It is one of the best built cameras around.  It feels nice and solid and every switch has the perfect feel to it.  There is no better built or nicer feeling camera in any price range.  While I am more of a function over form type of person, the jewel like quality of this camera does up the emotional joy of using this camera.Unfortunately, I need to digress here to address two ridiculous arguments I read all over the web and then hear parroted by people who have no idea what they are talking about.  I hate wasting time and if you are not interested then skip down to the asterisk and the review will continue there.The first bit of misinformation deals with what I call sensor envy.  It goes something like this: m43 is a fine stop gap measure until you can afford a so called \"full-frame\" sensor and thus are able to become a real photographer.  This is a pretty complex issue so I have put a great deal of detail in a discussion on the subject at the end of this review.  I've also attached a video I made from E-M1 photographs.  Also, I have put a challenge at the end of the video.  I have included 16 photos taken from a 35mm, a DX, and m43 sensors.  There are at least 3 images from each size sensor.  Unfortunately because it is so small it is not as spectacular as 1080p on a TV but even so if you like the EM1 photos and can't easilly tell the difference between sensors in the challenge, you might just be amazed and overjoyed with the EM1.The short version of what you need to know about sensor IQ is it is very much like horsepower in a car.  A lot of people want as much horsepower as they can get.  However, the fact of the matter is the fastest speed limit in America is 80 mph.  Because of this anything over 100 hp is really overkill.  You pay for the extra horsepower with a heavier car which costs more and burns more gas.  Same thing goes with cameras, the sensor IQ of just about every camera exceeds what most people need, so it is other features that are more important today.  But just like car magazines make sales on exciting super cars, camera sites generate sales and enthusiasm trumpeting how everyone should someday own a 35mm sensor to be a real photographer.  It is an emotional ploy to sell more cameras. (A much more detailed discussion can be found after the review).The second issue is a continuation of the sensor envy and goes something to the effect of Olympus is really pushing the bounds of what can be charged for a m43 sensor.  In the original version of this review I showed how the EM1 is better than the Nikon D600 in many aspects and yet is cheaper.  However, I think that may have given the impression that I don't feel the EM1 is overpriced (I think Olympus is one of the worst for overpricing their cameras).  My point was actually that, with the exception of Sony, all the major manufactures overprice their cameras and the web sites should be pointing that out for Nikon and Canon as well as m43 manufactures.  With the announcement of the 24 mp 35mm Sony A7 for $1700 and 36mp 35mm Sony A7r, the Canon 6D, 1Ds Mk III, Nikon D600, and Nikon D800 have instantly gone obsolete.  I am guessing Sony is selling the cameras below cost to gain market share.  I will talk more about the A7 in the buying guide at the end of the review..**********************************************************************************  Start Review Here*********************************************************************************I have owned or shot extensively tons of cameras so I am pretty familiar with brands and how cameras work.(Canon 1Ds MkII, 30D, Nikon D3, D300, D600, D700, D7000, D800, Panasonic G1, GF1, GH1, GH2, G3, GX7, Olympus E-P1, E-30, E-M5, Leica M8, M9, Fuji X100).  M4/3 are great cameras which are, in my opinion, the best choice for probably 95% of households looking for a large sensor camera.The first thing I want to really point out is the EVF.  It is huge and bright.  It also has a 1.48x magnification.  Most OVF are doing well to offer a .7x magnification.  What that means is OVFs are making the image 30% smaller while the EM1 EVF is making the image 48% larger.  This helps in focusing and framing.  While I won't go as far as saying it is revolutionary, it really does change the game for the better is a joy to use.  Many pros sites say they prefer the view from a large FX prism.  In most cases I actually prefer EVF.  The reason is the EVF is mostly What You See Is What You Get.  That means if you set a manual WB and then forgot to change it when you changed settings, you will see that in the EVF as the picture will look either to yellow or blue.  I also use the EVF as a very fast method of setting exposure.  Move the light sources around in the frame until you see the exposure you want and then lock it in.  Recompose and shoot.  This is an exceedingly fast way to play with your exposure and you can't do that with an OVF.The next feature is revolutionary and it is the 5 axis IBIS.  This was included in the EM5 which was the real revolution but the 5 axis in the EM1 is even better.  To give you an example, I can get about a 70% non-blurry hit rate shooting a 75mm f/1.8 at 1.6 seconds.  I got about a 20% hit rate at 2\" so I really recommend 1.6\" max.  If you have bad holding technique or shaky hands this feature is going to help you take better pictures.  If you are taking pictures above your head or down at your feet, this will help steady the shot.  There are IS systems in lenses and other camera bodies but none of them can touch the 5 axis IBIS in the EM1.  For video, it is good enough to eliminate the need for mechanical IS systems.  So for home users, even video taken while walking can be nice and smooth.The handling on this camera is the best in the world.  It can be exceedingly simple to use or if you really want to customize your camera it has the ability to do that as well.  I have read in another review that this camera is complicated to use even in iAuto mode.  I am not sure what that person was referring to.  In iAuto the camera does everything for you.  It sets shutter speed, aperture, ISO, white balance and scene mode.  There is nothing you need to do except press the shutter button.  The camera does everything else for you.  I have also read on too many sites that Olympus menus are poor and are overly complicated.  First off, most of the people writing these comments have been using Canon's or Nikon's poor and complicated mens for so many years that they have them memorized and can work them.  I am not going to say they are great or intuitive to use but then again neither are anyone else's.  However, the fact of the matter is after you use 1 or 2 of the menus to set up the camera you don't need to use them.  Olympus has a Quick Menu system that you activate by pressing the OK button in the center of the 4 direction controller.  Now for some reason on the EM1, it is not switched on as default.  So you will need to switch it on in both iAuto and PASM mode.  Once you have the Quick Menu up you can change any relevant shooting parameter you need without going into the menus.Another feature to mention about the EM1 is the Auto White Balance is amazingly good.  In every situation I have shot it has been spot on.  The only cameras I have shot before with AWB this good are the Fuji X100 and EM5.  Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, Leica all leave something to be desired when it comes to AWB.This camera is the upgrade path from the E5.  I am not going to go into exhaustive details between the differences.  You do need the MMF-3 to shoot 4/3 lenses with the EM1.  First, subjectively, the phase auto focus on the EM1 is not as fast as E5 or E30.  There are no cross type sensors on the EM1.  The difference between the 2 is really not that noticeable in real world shooting.  4/3 lenses, however, are noticeably slower than m4/3 lenses but still fast enough to get the job done.  The EM1 only has a tilt screen instead of fully articulated one.  Other than that, this camera completely outclasses the E5 in all categories to include IQ.  At least a 2 stop increase in dynamic range.The single shot autofocus on this camera is very fast.  Fast enough to keep up with little kids running around in low light situations.  With the 25mm f/1.4 it is near instantaneous in good light.  However its low light performance is not as good as the GX7. (The GX7 has the fastest low light performance I have ever seen.) With, the 25mm f/1.4 the EM1 auto focus was similar to the GX7 with no hunting.  However, with the 70mm f1.8, the camera often had to hunt to find the focus.M4/3 (including the EM5) have been a little hobbled in the past with a poor 1/160 flash sync and a lame 1/4000 fastest shutter speed.  The EM1, however, has a flash sync speed of 1/320 which is I believe faster than any DSLR which top out at 1/250.  Not really fast enough to get really excited about but fast enough to be useful.  The 1/8000 max shutter speed is also welcome as I like to shoot wide open primes in bright light and don't like toting around ND filters.It is unfortunate that Olympus did not build this pro-body with 2 card slots.  Two cards are really nice for paid events for redundancy in case one card dies on you.  With the amazing 12-40mm f2.8 on its way, this camera is an great events camera.  However, when your getting paid for your pictures you really want the redundancy of 2 card slots.  This camera also, has built in wifi.  Following the directions in the manual it was very easy to set up.  The Olympus generates a QR code which you take a picture of with your phone and then the app sets everything up.  Now with that said, I don't think wifi is going to be that useful for me.  If you need to remotely control a camera then this would be ok.  I could see a portrait studio having the camera set up on a tripod and using the phone to trigger the camera.  The reason I say this is ok is that the focus seemed really slow.  Also, it can transfer photos to your phone to upload to the web, so if that is something you have been waiting for then this will be useful for you.  However, a really nice feature of the EM1 wifi allows you to geo-tag your photos with your phones GPS coordinates.  This is something I might actually use.  This is also an intermittently updated function so it doesn't drain your phone and camera battery as much.M4/3 cameras are so small and light that I use them with a wrist strap instead of a neck strap. The grip on this camera is finally as good as the Panasonic G and GH series camera.  To me, grips point in the same direction as the lens so, as far as camera size goes when including the lens, it is essentially free as it doesn't make the system any deeper.  However, for camera real estate it provides a nice anchoring point and place to put the shutter release.  Bravo.  I have read this camera is it is too big.  However, when you sit it side-by-side with the GX7, it is about the same height and depth.  The extra height comes from the EVF poking out of the top and depth from the grip in the front.  Also is it is the size of the system that needs to be considered not the size of the camera.  Either of these cameras with a 100-300 is going to be a rather large camera.  However, both are going to be pretty small with a 14mm f2.5.All in all this is a fantastic little camera, that handles beautifully, takes great pictures.  If you want the best m43 camera available, this is it.  However, the GX7 matches the EM1 in most categories and best it in some (Auto focus speed, 40fps burst mode, silent mode) and is $500 cheaper.  The GX7 is going to be the better camera for most people.  However, there are a few situations where the E-M1 might be better for you than the GX7.  If you have 4/3 lenses, the E-M1 is a no brainer as the auto focus of those lenses are  much faster on the EM1.  If you don't know what I am talking about you don't have any.  If you need the extra battery life of the grip or you take tons of portrait orientation pictures, the E-M1 is the way to go.  If you want the best IBIS in any camera system, that will be in the EM1.  If you want the most weather sealed m4/3 camera that will also be the EM1.Pros:Revolutionary 5 Axis IBISVery Fast Auto FocusVery fast 4/3 auto focusWorld Leading Auto White BalanceWorld Leading Build QualityImage Quality1.48x EVFSmall and lightWorld Leading HandlingLen SystemCons:Only one SD slotBuying guide recommendation.Sony A7 or A7r - These are going to be amazing cameras at an amazing price and Olympus has priced the EM1 into where the $1700 A7 may be a consideration for someone looking to spend that much.  As I have said in this review, the IQ on these cameras is going to be better than the EM1 so if ultimate image quality is your goal these will be your cameras.  While these cameras are very small, the lenses are not.  Sony is trying to avoid this issue with the lenses they released.  The 35mm f2.8 is the most noticeable.  That is a very slow prime and is going to give the same DOF as an 17mm f/1.4 and only slightly more DOF control than the 17mm f/1.8.  However, when Sony does release the 35mm f/1.7 or f/1.4 it is going to be a very large lens.  Additionally, the  24-70mm f/4 lens is 1 stop slower than the Olympus 12-40mm f/2.8 and yet is larger and heavier, while having 10mm less zoom than the Olympus.  Sony's contrast autofocus is not as fast as Olympus or Panasonic.  So given a shallower DOF, the autofocus is going to be noticeably slower than the EM1.  Brilliant cameras to be sure but they are not going to be as good all around as the EM1 is.  For full disclosure, I have no intention of selling my m43 gear.  However, I am very seriously considering selling all of my Nikon gear and buying into this system.Sony RX10 - A stunning little camera.  If you want a high quality camera with a pro-grade 24-200mm f/2.8 zoom, and don't want to buy other lenses, this camera may be for you.  It is only a 1\" sensor so it is smaller than m43 so it will be even harder to get really shallow DOF.  However, it is a back illuminated sensor (something I think m43 should have done a long time ago) so it is very likely this camera will exceed m43 and many APS-C cameras for low light performance.  Combine that with a constant 2.8 24-200mm pro-zoom and you have an amazing combination.  The only downside I see for this is you are marrying a very expensive lens to a sensor.  With interchangeable lenses systems, once you spring for the expensive lens, you can continue to reuse it as you purchase newer camera bodies.  If that doesn't bother you, this is going to be a stunning camera.Panasonic GX7 - Panasonic's best still camera to date - Great construction, 1/320 flash sync, 1/8000 shutter speed, blazing fast focus, WIFI, IBS, focus peeking, great handling, etc.  This camera does cost $150 more than the NEX-6, which is similarly specked (Sony must be giving them away).  However, m4/3 lenses are always going to be quite a bit smaller and lighter than NEX lenses.  Additionally, the m4/3 lens system is the most complete outside of legacy 35mm systems from Nikon and Canon.Panasonic G6 - Great little camera for a nice price ($650 with lens).  IQ not quite as good as the EM1, build quality not as good as GX7, and has slower flash sync and shutter speed.  It has a tilt and swivel screen which in my opinion is actually nicer than the tilt only screen on the GX7, EM5, and EM1.  If you want to get into the system, this is a good way to start.  Save money on the camera and spend it on a nice lens.Panasonic G5 - Right now if you look for the clearance sales you can get them for $300-400.  Not as good as any of the other cameras here but still a great camera which takes nice pictures.Olympus E-M5 - this camera has now been outclassed by the GX-7 and costs the same.  So while this is still a brilliant camera, the GX-7 is better for the same money.Olympus E-P5 - Has no built in view finder which for me is an absolute no go. Get either the E-M5, GX-7 or E-M1NEX-6 - Really nice camera - Focus is not as fast a m4/3.  Sensor is bigger so for higher ISO it will have better IQ.  Price is great.  However, this camera does not handle as well as the Panasonic.  While the camera is small, the lenses are not so this system is not as small and light as the m4/3.  The lens system is nowhere near complete as the m4/3 system.  If price is your only consideration, then the NEX-6 is probably the way to go.Any DSLR -  Bigger and heaver - DSLRs are dinosaurs when compared to mirrorless cameras.  I really hate going back from shooting my E-M1 to shooting my Nikons.  They are big, the focus system is obsolete (not phase focus, but the focus points and how they are arranged).  The, live view is terrible, most of the viewfinders are smaller then the newest EVFs, and are lacking some of the features of the mirrorless.  Tons of people buy Nikon and Canon because that is what is around,  however, my opinion is the vast majority of families would be much better served by a m4/3 system.********************************************************************************** Start thesis on Sensor Size*********************************************************************************Is a FX sensor better than a m4/3?  Is a m4/3 sensor better than a FX?  The answer to both those questions is \"It depends.\"  Anyone who tries to give you a one size fits all answer either has no clue what they are talking about or are trying to sell you something.  I will attempt to try and explain the relative merits of each so you can make an informed decision.  I am really only going to discuss FX (AKA 35mm or mislabeled as full-frame.  Whatever that even really means as there are medium format cameras and large format cameras with much larger imaging circles.) as what I say about it will apply to DX to a lessor extent.The 4 major components of IQ are Resolution, Color Depth, Dynamic Range, and High ISO.  You can if you want go to DXOMark and look at all the sensor data.  I will give you numbers for the best of breed of each size.  D800 36mp, 25.3 bit color depth, 14.4 Stop Dynamic Range and 2853 ISO.  For D7100 it is 24mp, 24.2, 13.7 and 1256.  For EP5, 16mp, 22.8, 12.4, 895.  Higher is \"better\" and so by numbers the IQ of the FX D800 is best.  (I am using the EP5 because there is not DxOMark Score for the EM1.  Before, we move on to some other items concerning sensor, let me show you the numbers for the 2006 35mm Canon 1Ds MkII.  Before I show them to you, you need to know this was a pro-camera that cost $8000 when it came out and at 16.7mp was the first 35mm digital considered capable of shooting double-truck ads for national magazines.  Here are the numbers for this camera 16mp, 23.3, 11.3, 1480.  So, based on objective numbers, the m43 sensor of today is about equivalent of the camera used for pro work in 2006 to 2008.  It actually has a better dynamic range than the 35mm camera does.  (A comment I want to make concerning the ISO numbers.  I am not sure how these are computed or relate to each other.  I shot with the 1Ds MkII extensively and I can without a doubt say the files from the EM5 look better than the 1Ds Mk II at 6400 ISO.  Also, you can go to DPReview and see 100% magnified files shot at various ISOs and various cameras.  The files from the D800  look to me about 1 to 1.5 stops better than the EM5.  That is the D800 files at 6400 look the same with regard to noise as EM5 shot at 3200.)  Just for info purposes here are some of numbers from some other older cameras I shot with.  Canon 30D 10mp, 21.5, 10.8, 736 and Nikon D300, 12mp, 22.1, 12, 679.  As you can see the EP5 outclasses both of those cameras based on the numbers and yet I got really nice pictures with both those cameras. (Going back to that ISO number again, I shot extensively with both of those cameras and their files at ISO 800 were about the same as the EM5 at 6400. The EM5 is about 3 stops better yet the DxOMark ISO values are about the same.  Also, the EM5 6400 JPEGs are sharp and clean.  Very nice.)  If all you care about is IQ and you need all that IQ, then by all means the D800 is even better than the best medium format except in color depth used for portraits so get the D800.However, as I showed you with the 1Ds MkII, the IQ of sensors, long ago exceeded what we need for home use.  So the fact of the matter is, most people don't need the IQ of the D800 and there are, to me, more relevant reasons why the D800 is not something most people would even like.  The first is 36mp files.  Shot in 14bit RAW, you are looking at around a 65MB image file.  Roughly, 15 of those images make 1GB.  Even the JPEGs are huge around 15MB each.  That is a pain to store and a pain to process.  What do most people do with their images?  I would say the number 1 thing people do is is to put them on the web or their phones.  The biggest monitors are around 2.5mp.  To print a 300dpi 8x10 requires around 7mp. Requires.  That means if you view the picture on a 2.5mp monitor you giving up 33.5mp.  (This is not entirely accurate as the image is interpolated down and you do clean up noise when you do that.)  That is for a full screen image not the little happy snaps you text or put on facebook which are more likely to be around 1mp or less.  Do you really think you need 36mp?  If so, then m4/3 is not the right format for me.  I personally, like the 10-12mp range (and wish they would make a 12mp m43) but 16mp is more than enough for me.  I mentioned earlier, that when you downsize an image it is interpolated down and this helps clean up the image.  Well that applies to the m4/3 images as well.  So even though the D800 is 1 to 1.5 stops better for noise, when you interpolate the images down, you are very unlikely to be able to see that on your screen or even on a print except at ISOs greater than 6400 or maybe 3200.  So I think we have established the FX sensor has better IQ than m4/3 but I hope I have established for most people it just doesn't matter because the m4/3 sensors are more than good enough for tasks most people use cameras for.So what are the downsides of FX sensors.  The first and most obvious is price, although with Nikon's D600 fiasco, you can get a FX sensor for around $1500.  However, the other costs associated with the FX sensor are the lenses.  The best lenses are very expensive.  Also, the imaging circle of a FX is roughly 2x the size of the imaging circle of m4/3.  That means, the lenses are going to be bigger and heavier and the difference is not trivial.  A D800 with a 70-200mm f.28 is going to set you back about $5300 and around 6-7lbs.  A EM1 with a 40-150mm f/2.8 will set you back about $2300 and around 3lbs.  I can and have carried 4 m4/3 bodies with 2 fast zooms and 2 fast primes in the same bag I can only carry 2 DSLR bodies and lenses.  I also carried several extra lenses in that bag.  The weight of that bag, bodies, lenses, and iPad was 10lbs.  Two FX bodies and fast zooms alone are going to weigh more than that.  If you really feel like you want to lug all that around, then by all means get the FX.  All that weight also means you will be carrying around a heavier tripod if you use one. Do you think if maybe you had to hike your camera in somewhere that maybe the smaller sensor might be better?  If you are traveling somewhere and carrying your camera all day, can you see how the smaller sensor would be better?  Something to think about.Next, the contrast autofocus use by m4/3 is on the sensor and it is exceedingly fast.  What this means, is you have focusing points throughout your frame.  The phase detect systems used on FX DSLRs only has points clustered around the middle.  The corners are excluded.  Also, the phase detect systems are separate from the sensor.  Therefore, with FX you have back focusing and front focusing issues.  The so called live view systems on the DSLRs are really the only accurate way to auto or manual focus and is terribly slow (What you see thought the prism is not what the sensor is seeing it is what the autofocus is seeing.)  That means the only way to quickly frame and focus a FX DSLR is through the viewfinder.  Forget holding the camera over your head or down at your feet.The next issue is with dust on the sensor.  With all my DX and FX sensors DSLRs, dust has always been an issue (Talk about a way to ruin image quality).  It was so bad on the D600 they have had to significantly drop the price on that camera.  In almost 5 years shooting m4/3, I have never had 1 single problem with dust on the sensor.Another \"benefit\" of FX is the shallower Depth of Field that can be achieved for the same aperture.  The reason I put that in quotes is that in a lot of cases the DOF on a FX is too shallow and you need to stop down the lens to f4 or f5.6 to get the DOF you are looking for.  In these cases, a m4/3 is clearly superior as you can stay at f2 or f2.8 to get the same DOF.  This means you are collecting 4 times the light and, therefore, you can turn your ISO down 2 stops (According to the images on DPReview, a 100% EM5 image at 1600 looks better than a D800 6400 image).  Also, for flash or lighting for video filming, a 2 stop ISO difference means 4 times less light power is required for the m4/3 sensor. That means your flash batteries will last longer and your flash will recycle that much quicker.Another drawback of the FX sensor is it is stuck in the archaic 2:3 ratio which is not as friendly for printing as a 4:3 ration is.  To print a 4:5 ration 8x10 from a 2:3 ratio there is quite a bit of cropping to be done and often a picture won't fit.Finally, the pixel densities on m4/3 are the highest of any large sensor camera.  A DX sensor with the same pixel density as a 16mp m4/3 sensor would be roughly 32mp and a FX sensor would be 64mp.  This is both good and bad for m4/3 cameras.  Currently, there are no DX or FX sensors with pixel densities of the m4/3.  So you are currently getting more reach on your m4/3 lenses than any other lenses.  What this means is, given the same focal length, you are getting approximately 1.5x the data on a subject for the same area than an FX and 1.25 vs a DX sensor.  This is not to be confused with crop factor which based on the sensor size is 2x compared to FX sensor and 1.5x compared to a DX sensor. This does come with a downside to the m4/3 in that it works your lenses harder (exposes optical flaws in the lenses) and you hit diffraction limits on IQ at around F8 vice F11.Since you have read this far, I am going to talk about the new Sony A7 and A7r which is going to be Sony's new mirroless 35mm interchangeable lens camera systems with 24mp and 36mp.  Do these tempt me are make me want to wait.  The answer to those questions is not at all.  Everything I has said above still holds true for the now Sonys.  Even with the Sony in the mix, my first choice for a camera would be an EM1.  However, if ultimate image quality is the most important fact to you, I think the A7 systems are going to be stunning and will probably drive Leica out of the camera making business.  I think Leica lenses will be incredibly popular on these systems.Buy 35mm FX if:- You need the best image quality available to print big.  At 200 dpi (good enough for most people) you can print a 16mp image up to 23x17.  If you need bigger than that, get a FX.- You absolutely have to have the shallowest DOF available in a DSLR body.  I've owned FX camera bodies and I will admit sometimes I do miss the razor shall DOF images I was occasionally able to capture.  With that, however, the DOF was so small I often missed the focus especially on wiggly subjects such as kids.  Also, with 2 or more people, DOF at 1.4 was way too shallow so forget about it. With my 75mm 1.8, I don't miss FX as much as my pictures from that lens have a very similar feel as the FX pictures.  I liked the D700 a lot but the fact of the matter is, I used my GH1 far more.- You have to have the biggest sensor to feel good about yourself.

I originally thought this would be an E-M5 with a better build, feel and faster AF and at the end of the day I found it to be much more. Due to the lack of an AA filter, the IQ has indeed been enhanced. Images are sharper/crisper and the high ISO has also been improved. I have written 5700 words on this camera and shared a ton of images as well as a comparison against a Leica M. At the end of the day this camera is so good, I ordered one from Amazon for myself.Below is my \"FInal Conclusion\" from the full review I posted on my website on the E-M1:Well here we are in 2013 and the choices for all of us crazy enthusiasts are plentiful and excellent. We finally have a definitive Micro 4/3 camera body that is pro level and can do just about anything one needs it to do and do it in any weather. As always, I review cameras from an enthusiasts point of view in a real world way. There are things I do not even get into like Flash, because I have not used a flash in 14 years. I am anti-flash even though I know it is good to have on some occasions. But as an enthusiast and a passionate photographer who has seen it all and used them all, I can say with confidence that the OM-D E-M1 is one of the best cameras \"as a whole\" that I have ever reviewed. It is superb. Yes, there are others with better overall IQ and others with better high ISO but as a whole, speaking of the whole package, nothing else has come close.You have seen me rant and rave about a few different camera models over the year. Leica's and Sony's for the most part. Well as of today there is a new camera in town that offers the perfect mix of speed, usability, build, image quality, cost and lenses to place it at the top of the heap in the world of mirrorless cameras. Someone asked me today if I would take a Canon 6D and 85L or an E-M1 and 25 1.4. For me that choice is easy. The E-M1 only because it would go with me everywhere when the 6D would be left behind. It is just too large, too bulky and too heavy and the lenses, while fantastic are just too much weight wise for everyday use.The image quality of the E-M1 is an improvement over the E-M5 due to the new processor and lack of an AA filter. The files pop more and I feel they also have slightly different color that I prefer. Crisp. Beautiful. The exposure metering is fantastic, the AWB is fantastic, the out of camera colors are beautiful.There will always be naysayers no matter what towards this Micro 4/3 system. But those who disregard or trash Micro 4/3 or the E-M1 have no idea what they are doing or saying. There is simply nothing to trash and that is fact.It will not match full frame like the RX1 or M in all out flat out IQ but it will meet head to head ANY APS-C mirrorless and beat them on build, speed, and every other area usability area with ease. What it boils down to for me is..Olympus E-M1 or Full Frame? The answer for me is BOTH. One all out IQ monster and one usability and IQ monster. :)Also, let us not forget the lenses. Micro 4/3 has some of the best lenses made for any system, period. There are many highly recommended jewels in the lineup.  At the end of the day this camera gets my highest recommendation. Buy the E-M1 and a couple of nice fast primes and go out and use it and it will be hard to put it down. The Olympus E-M1 has the charm, the soul and the goods to Be my pick for Camera of the Year 2013. Not sure if it will as I hear Sony has something on the way but as it stands now, the E-M1 is at the top of the list. :)As of this writing (October 12th 2013) I can say that for me, the Olympus E-M1 is the best Mirrorless camera on the market today when looking at the \"Whole Picture\" of cost, size, build, speed, toughness, EVF, performance, features and lenses available. No one else even comes close and I should know, I have used EVERYTHING out there. Well done Olympus, you have indeed created a mirrorless masterpiece!Which would I take?Panasonic GX7 or E-M1: E-M1 no contest.E-M1 or Fuji X Body: E-M1 no contest.E-M1 or new rumored Sony Full Frame: BOTH, one for the Full Frame IQ and look and one for all that I have raved about.E-M1 or NEX-6: E-M1 due to the lenses and speed and build and IQ.E-M1 or Fuji X100s: Close, but for me, E-M1E-M1 or Pentax K3? The new Pentax looks amazing on Paper, but is still a DSLR. I can not say until I test the K3 :)E-M1 or Leica M: Two different cameras for different audiences. End of story, so BOTH :)", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Great Stills Camera with Only Minor Nitpicks", "Author": "Emmanuel \"ShutterMan\"", "ReviewID": "R1I39F4VILBTO", "Overall": "4.0",

The E-M1's image improvement over the E-M5 is not as big of leap as the E-M5 was over the 12mp PEN series and Sony's new 36mp camera does not improve upon Nikon's D800 (Sony) sensor.  However, there is much more to cameras than sensors.  With the exception of the D4, I previously owned every semi-pro and professional Nikon camera since the D2 and I now shoot with Canon.  Camera brand means very little to me, they are just tools.  As of now, this is the best m4/3 camera in the market and one of the best mirrorless cameras period.  For video, the Panasonic GH3 is the best choice (See comments).Both my primary and backup cameras are full frame DSLRs.  If the E-M1 had two SD slots I would have bought two and made it my new system of choice, so for now, it is my 2nd backup, my travel, studio, and just about everything else camera.  Below I will weigh its pros and cons against the E-M5 and a few other DSLRs....::::::::::::::::::: Pros :::::::::::::::::::SIZE:It is tiny, any reports about m4/3 losing its way by creating such a large camera are greatly exaggerated.  Reading the dimensions online does not compare to actually holding it, any smaller and it would be too small.DYNAMIC RANGE:On par with Canon full-framesAutoWB:Is okay, but because the EVF shows a live image, if off, one can easily change the WB with the 2x2 lever or the one shot custom WB button.IMAGE STABILIZATION:The best there is, I have taken photos with the 75mm at \u00bc sec and they were SHARP.  That is amazing!  There is also the benefit of having image stabilization in the body (IBIS) instead of in the lens.  According to the owner of lensrentals.com, lenses with image stabilization break down more often.  It is hard to argue with someone that has hundreds of samples (tinyurl.com/lens-rentals-data).  Looking carefully at lensrentals.com, one will notice that with similarly priced lenses, the image-stabilized rentals are often more expensive.  They have calculated the likelihood of future breakdown after heavy use and priced accordingly.  In addition, IBIS adds stabilization to legacy lenses.EVF: Most online reviews call this the best in the market; I cannot confirm this because I have not used any other EVF as extensively as the two OMD cameras.  Nevertheless, the E-M1 has several advantages over the original OMD.  The E-M5 is supposed to have WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) display, in other words if the photo looks well exposed in the EVF the recorded image should look the same.  I often found this was not the case.  The recorded image seemed to be about \u00bd-1 stop underexposed, and not just with the RAW converter, the image review too showed a vastly different image.  The E-M1's EVF and review are identical, so much so that I turn off the review in most occasions.METERING:My E-M5 always metered about 1-stop underexposed, this along with the inaccurate EVF created havoc in fast pace situations where I do not have time to calmly analyze my options.  With the E-M5, I permanently added +1 Exposure Shift (pg. 92 e-m5 manual) and still used exposure compensation often.  The E-M1 is so good at metering that I rarely use exposure compensation when shooting in Aperture priority.HIGH ISO:According to some online reviews, there is no substantial difference between the two OM-D cameras.  However, most tests I have seen use a flawed methodology.  They set the camera on Aperture Priority or manually set the camera to a certain ISO and Aperture, then adjust the shutter speed until both cameras appear similarly exposed.  They completely ignore that the shutter speeds on the E-M5 are about 1/3 to 2/3 stop slower.  To me this signifies that the E-M5 ISO rating is further off the stated number.  The typical response to this is \"ISO is not a standard... every camera will be different... not to worry about it\".  Well ISO (International Organization for Standardization) should be closely adhered; otherwise, it defeats the point of having a standard.  Back to my point, if I am at a dance recital, I have the E-M1, and my wife is shooting with the E-M5 both set on manual, 1/320, F/1.8, ISO 3200, my images are well exposed and her camera noticeably underexposes.  This is why I think most online comparisons are off the mark.LCD SCREEN:When using the eye proximity sensor on the E-M5 (with LCD off) and I move away the rear LCD stays off, see video above to see how the E-M1 handles the same situation.  The LCD turns on.  It concerns me because I am trying to squeeze every ounce of juice from the battery.BUILD AND WEATHERPROOFING:The E-M5 survived a winter storm in the Cascades; I expect the new camera to do just as well.HANDLING:Here is the big one.  The E-M1 allows me to work quickly with little interruptions.  After the initial setup, which appears daunting at first, but after some time it is a snap, the camera becomes an intuitive piece of machinery.  Anyone that has ever used the E-M5 as extensively as I have probably came across situations where one would say, \"I wish Olympus would do this differently, it would be great if the camera could do this, etc.\"  It appears that Olympus listened to my inner voice, because I cannot not think of any physically accessible function I would do different.AUTOFOCUS:Blazing fast and much more accurate than E-M5 thanks to the much smaller AF select boxes. The face recognition is great for close to medium distances, it will struggle on far away subjects.CAMERA CLOCK:According to the atomic clock, it is off 1-2 seconds each month, well within spec with other cameras.  With the E-M5, I would synchronize with my other cameras and it would go off about 5-11 seconds every hour.  My D800s would stay in sync and during my transition to Canon, they too stayed in sync with the Nikons.  This does not seem like a big deal until I merge my assistant's photos and all of a sudden the timeline is off and doing a batch metadata adjustment does not work.PC SYNC:When I switched over to Canon, I swapped out my Nikon PocketWizard TT5 for the Canon version to trigger my studio's monolights. When I did, my trigger reliability with the first OM-D went from 80% to 0% unless I switched to standard channels. This meant losing the ability to control my lights with my Sekonic lightmeter.  I now get 100% reliability thanks to the PC Sync connection and get to control my lights with the lightmeter.  .COLOR:Because 90% of my shooting involves people, I will concentrate only on skin tones.- Previous generation Nikon (D3, D700, D3s) sensors that were either made by Nikon or at the very least manufactured by someone other than Sony, had warm but pleasing color that worked well with Asian, African, and with most Caucasian skin tones.- New generation Nikons (D800, D600) are still warm, but have an unpleasantness that is harder to fix in post-processing. Even when using Passport Colorcheck, it takes a lot of playing around with the white balance (WB), RGB Channels, or HSL Sliders in LR, I have tried Capture One and DXO to see if I got better results but I did not like their interfaces and gave up trying.- The Sony's I've used, the A-850, NEX-5, 6, and 7, have a strong Cyan cast, and it is not an easy fix with the WB slider.  They too require fiddling with the RGB or HSL sliders. Like the new Nikons, I find this approach inconvenient because the changes are not fixed; the adjustments change depending on the lighting conditions.- I find that if one likes the colors on the Canon 5d, mkII, mkIII, they will likely find the Olympus colors pleasing.  I would say the Olympus skin tones are generally very good on all skin types.  The WB slider usually fixes any issues.  Note:  Adobe LR can at times oversaturate the reds.::::::::::::::::::: Cons :::::::::::::::::::HANDLING:The control dial is missing MySet designations.  Although one can change the P, iAuto, and scenes to MySets, it is not the same.STORAGE:What was Olympus thinking only having one SD card slot for a \"PRO\" camera?  This is especially scary since I just had Sandisk replaced a failing 64gb SDHC card.Wifi:It is great for controlling the camera. However, it only works well for shooting with a tripod. It would have been nice to shoot normally and have the images automatically transfer to my iPad similar to the EyeFi.VIDEO:The video codec on this camera is quite bad when compared to Panasonic's top offerings, it by no way affects me, but I know that it is important to others.BUNDLED SOFTWARE:Olympus Viewer 3 processes ISO 200-400 raw files better than Adobe Lightroom (or ACR).  The images are cleaner and sharper without artifacts (contrast-1, sharpness -1 or 0, Noise Off).  Adobe introduces slight noise even at ISO 200.  The problem with the Olympus software is that it is EXTREMELY slow and additional processing is limited.  I will use Adobe for 98% of my processing because it is more than good enough, but if I get a real winner that I plan on printing 13x19 or larger, I will use the bundled software to get the best image and export the TIFF into Adobe.AUTOFOCUS: (nitpicks)- There are too many AF select points.  It would like the option to choose which AF points are available, because I only need 11 boxes spread throughout the image.- The Canon 5DIII has different AF Home Points (or defaults) based on whether the camera is horizontal or vertical, it saves me the hassle of moving across with what seems like a million AF sensors to get to the right area of the image.  This is something I wish Olympus did with the E-M1. A firmware upgrade could easily add this or have select point, however, Olympus does not add many new features via firmware.- Face detection should try to find faces near the currently selected AF point.  Currently, when the AF point is on far right, it may focus on a face that temporarily pops up in on the left.::::::::::::::::::: Summary :::::::::::::::::::I know that the m4/3 sensor cannot compete with a Full-Frame DSLR in super high ISO and super thin DOF, but it also has its advantages.  All of my m4/3 lenses are razor sharp wide-open, my FF lenses usually require stopping down 1-2 stops to sharpen up.  Having more DOF is sometimes an advantage. This is why I ultimately chose m4/3, having an APS-C sensor meant compromise; I will not get the thin DOF of a Full-Frame, nor do I get the greater DOF of m4/3's.  Having both a FF and m4/3 system makes perfect sense to me because I can choose the right tool for the job.BOTTOM LINE:With the smaller focus squares, decent continuous AF, accurate EVF, and better controls.  I am getting more keepers, spending less time trying to fix exposure problems in post with the E-M1 versus any camera and overall I am having a better experience::::::::::::::::::: Notes :::::::::::::::::::Note 1:  The Nikon N5005 had the same sensor (film) as the Nikon F5, but sold for thousands less. Was the F5 better, absolutely, could an experienced photographer capture the same image with either camera, probably, then why pay more?  Because the F5's controls allow quicker adjustments, faster shutter and sync speeds, better metering, reliable focus, better viewfinder, and weather sealed for less than ideal conditions.  All of these functions give the F5 user more flexibility.  Because if the sensor is the most important part, one may have to wait years for technologies like Foveon alternatives or organic sensors to improve upon current Bayer type sensors, but I do not think my clients are willing to wait until then.Note 2: If Henri Cartier-Bresson owned an OM-D instead of a Leica, would his work have suffered? Not very likely.  I do not know what pixel peeping experts say, but I do feel that modern m4/3 cameras have surpassed 35mm film.  I challenge anyone that shot 35mm film to dig up some old slides and scan them at 16 megapixels.  Be prepared to see how soft those images really are when viewed on a monitor at 100%.Note 3: Many are fast to dismiss m4/3 cameras because its sensor is a bit smaller than APS-C, which of course is already smaller than 35mm \"Full Frame\" sensors.  Well if sensor size is the only determining factor in quality, then we should be lugging around 8 x 10\" film cameras on a mule.  The 35mm format took off over a half century ago because it gave good (enough) results in a smaller convenient package.  However, with the exception of the new Sony A7, the 35mm format has grown considerably through the years to the modern behemoths we see today.Note 4: Sony's new well-priced A7 is an interesting camera, but from the samples showing up on the net, it does not work well with adapted wide-angle lenses.  Because the E-mount is relatively narrow for being so close to the sensor, fast lenses are going to be longer, especially on the wider end.  To me, big lenses defeat the point of small cameras.  Notice how their roadmap has generally slow lenses.  Lastly, the prices on lenses seem a bit high.  Although, I probably should keep my mouth shut since I've spent a fair sum on m4/3 lenses :)<<< UPDATE >>>  In a recent interview, a Sony Exec mentioned that there are no plans for crazy fast lenses for the new FE E-mount, seems unlikely this system will ever get fast specialty prime lenses.  Severely limiting future system potential, i.e., I fear it will never match Canon or Nikon's complete DSLR lineups especially given Sony's track record of putting out like 4 camera bodies to every lens.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy purchase decision if you own the E-5 and Olympus lens", "Author": "sdaniela \"musicmansteve\"", "ReviewID": "R1TV1OJ5GS170", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Should you buy this camera?1. Absolutely YES...if you are a dedicated Olympus guy/gal with a serious investment in Zuiko lenses, then this upgrade is an absolute no-brainer. Buy it now and you will finally be able to compete with your Canon and Nikon buddies in low-light and high resolution. They'll be jealous of the small package and amazing array of features in this camera, and you'll finally get the full performance out of the Zuiko HG and SHG lenses that were always overmatched for the Olympus bodies (more on the performance of the camera below).2. Almost certainly...if you are looking for your first DSL system and prefer a very lightweight and compact camera system over the bulkier full-size DSLRs YET you still want pro-level control and image quality AND a large selection of medium-to-high grade lenses. If that description fits you, then this camera is the best choice today. The micro four thirds standard is the most diverse system in this category, as Nikon and Canon have yet to really compete in the mirrorless segment beyond a few entries and lenses. Sony is another good option, but their mirrorless lens choices are very thin and overpriced IMO...but I digress.3. Seriously Consider...if you are Canon/Nikon pro who makes money with your photography and you're looking for a smaller rig on occasion. The EM-1 could be a nice second (or third) rig with image quality that will impress you even in low light. The light weight and small size of the lenses (especially the fast primes) will surprise you. You might find yourself in places and situations where the full-size camera is too imposing or distracting, while the EM-1 is barely even noticeable (and the shutter is nearly silent). I think we're going to see the mirrorless systems showing up more often in professional settings, especially as the bodies improve and the lens choices increase. Right now, this is the best of the breed.4. Maybe...if you have an aging full-size DSLR from Canon or Nikon and it's time for an upgrade.  Depending on how much you have invested in your glass, a switch to this system should give you substantially better image performance, much smaller size and probably less cost when compared to buying a new full-size sensor body with several fast lenses. It's a commitment to a new system, but if your current setup is old and can't cut it any longer, then this might be the right time to switch.5. Probably not...if you are invested heavily in Canon and Nikon glass and accessories. The quality of this camera is very, very good, but not good enough to justify significant expense in new lenses.I bought this camera because I fit into category 1 above. I am a long-time Olympus digital SLR owner (which has not been an easy road, frankly). I originally bought into the Olympus four-thirds system because their lenses were so much faster (i.e., brighter) than competitors at a similar price point, and their equipment is very well made. I think the price was a bit steep (even more than I paid for my E-5), but the quality to match the price is there, and let's face it...Olympus owners don't really have a choice if we want to continue using our high-end Olympus glass.Some background on my perspective...skip the nex paragraph if you don't care.I started with the E-1, moved to the E-620 and then the E-5. I've been using the E-5 exclusively for the past three years. (I also bought a Panasonic mirrorless micro four thirds body to play with, but I never liked the lack of control it offered, so I stuck with the E-5.) I also have many Olympus lenses, including four of their high-end SHG lenses, and if it hadn't been for my (significant) investment in this glass, I would have abandoned the four-thirds standard long ago. I've long been jealous of my Canon and Nikon friends with much better low-light performance and better resolution.  On the other hand, they were jealous of my insanely fast Olympus glass, so I waited to see Olympus' next move before deciding whether to stay or jump ship.The OM-D EM-1 wasn't exactly the body I was expecting, but now that I have shot with it for a week, I'm sold. Finally, I have a camera that competes nicely (not equally, but close) with full frame sensor bodies. The build quality on this camera is top notch, equal to the E-5 and even better in some respects. The controls will be familiar to anyone who has used (and loved) the unique Olympus body control layouts. Everything on this camera is fast, fast, fast. Contrast focus is great with MFT lenses and the phase-detection is even faster than my E-5 (which was no slouch with SWF lenses).Now, here are answers to questions I had before I bought the EM-1 (that no else seemed to address). I think they will be particularly helpful for existing Olympus camera owners:1. Is the EM-1 image quality *finally* competitive with the \"big boys?\"In a word, yes. Olympus owners can finally take the bag off their heads! No more making excuses for our low light performance, poor focus speed or low resolution. I'm continually surprised (in a good way) by the image quality of the EM-1. It's visibly better than the E-5, and in low light situations the difference between the EM-1 and previous Olympus bodies is...well...night and day. Noise is all but nonexistent at ISO 6400 or below (and even higher ISOs are very usable). This was always Olympus biggest weakness compared to other cameras, but that difference is mostly erased with this camera. Compared to my friend's full frame Canon, the EM-1 colors look a little over saturated (in the typical Olympus way, especially the reds), but I kinda like the pumped look, and you can always desaturate in post if you prefer the flatter, more neutral Canon look. White balance is outstanding. Olympus bodies typically handled white balance well, but this one nails it every time.2. Is the camera still easy to configure and control in the typical Olympus way of doing things?Look up the word \"configurable\" on wikipedia, and you will find a picture of the EM-1. Virtually every button can be remapped to another purpose. Olympus might as well have labeled every button on the camera with a letter (e.g., A, B, C, etc.) instead of a specific function, because you can change every button to do whatever function you prefer. In fact, you can make multiple buttons do the SAME thing. The manual comes on a CD, but it's not that long and you can print it at home with a laser printer for a few pennies. It's worth it because you'll need it to configure the camera properly. After about an hour, I had the EM-1 buttons remapped to match the configuration on my E-5. Yeah...zero retraining required!3. Do I need the new Olympus M Zuiko Digital ED 12-40mm f/2.8 or should I stick with my four-thirds lenses and the adapter?How rich are you? If you have the money, replace your four thirds lenses with good M4/3, but it will cost you. The 12-40mm is a cool $1,000. After I got my EM-1 I attached a few of my SHG lenses, and they worked perfectly, but they look ridiculous. I initial intended to stick my big Olympus glass to save money, but after one day with the EM-1, I decided to invest in high-end micro four thirds lenses. It completely ruins the point of a svelte micro four thirds body when mated to oversized lenses. I love the quality of SHG glass, and I certainly won't be dumping those lenses anytime soon, but for everyday photography needs (i.e., with the kids at the amusement park, walking around the tourist spots, a casual moment with the family and pets, etc.) you don't want to mate a small, lightweight camera with a ginormous, heavy lens. My first purchase was the 12-40mm (on the wait list now) and I've already bought a few of the M4/3 primes including the Oly 17mm, Pana/Leica 25mm, Oly 45mm and Oly 75mm (my favorite). I'm told Olympus is working to replicate the fast zooms of the SHG four thirds line in M4/3 versions. Let's hope for it.4. Can I live with an electronic viewfinder instead of optical?The electronic viewfinder is absolutely stunning. When I first heard Olympus was abandoning their traditional four-third bodies in favor of mirrorless, I was VERY concerned about losing an optical viewfinder like in my E-5. I took one look through the EM-1, and I was sold on electronic viewfinders. It's bigger and brighter than the E-5 - and most other cameras I'm told. My only complaint is that colors are rendered a little cooler and unsaturated in the viewfinder (as compared to the back screen and the actual photo), but you can adjust the tone and brightness of the viewfinder screen in the endless control settings on this camera. There are three different viewfinder modes so you can select the data you prefer to see, and it automatically turns on and off when you bring it to your eye. Very smart. The first time you try to focus your shot at dusk in near total darkness, you'll learn to appreciate the advantages of electronic viewfinders over optical.  No regrets here.5. What accessories should I buy?Personally, I think the $200 battery extender grip accessory is a must-have for this camera. First, it makes the camera easier to hold, since the EM-1 is quite small in larger hands. Obviously, you can always remove the battery holder when you want the smallest possible camera. More importantly, if you are accustomed to the 600+ shots of the E-5 battery, be aware you aren't going to get that with this camera. You can only get that level of performance with the extended battery pack. The single internal battery in the camera is good for maybe 300 or so. Other than the battery extender grip, there's not much else you need. You can reuse Olympus lenses, flashes, wired remotes, etc.6. How does it feel and sound?It feels wonderful. The button actions are noticeably better than the E-5 buttons, which always felt a little \"squishy\" to me. Every switch action oozes quality, like a finely made device. Except the SC card door...it's nothing special. Sound wise, the EM-5 uses the same \"double beep\" focus confirmation as the E-5 (with volume settings, of course). More importantly, everyone remarks on how quiet the shutter is. It has a very quiet but satisfying \"thunk\" sound compared to the more traditional \"click\" DSLR shutter sound. Sounds like the shutter is under a pillow, but still very reassuring. Sounds like quality, like a German car door closing. It's perfect for taking photos in sensitive surroundings. All in all, the camera feels like the money you paid for it.7. How will I process RAW images from this thing? No one has a RAW profile for this camera yet.I have long used Olympus' Studio Pro software to do RAW processing to JPG for my E-series cameras. The software had the unique ability to apply Olympus' lens correction data to the final image to eliminate distortion, aberrations and corner shadows. I tried comparing the output of Studio Pro to ACR and Apple's RAW converters, and Olympus always came up better. But Olympus hasn't updated this software in forever, so I wondered what software Olympus would bundle with the EM-1. I was pleasantly surprised. The software provided is basically an updated version of Studio Pro, though it goes by a different name and lacks some pro features. (Specifically, it lacks the ability to control the camera by wire, but this feature is now available through the smartphone app, so it's a wash.) The update still includes all the RAW processing features I liked in Studio Pro, including applying lens correction data for any Olympus digital lens. But, I also learned that if you prefer to shoot in JPG, the EM-1's in-camera JPG processing also applies the lens correction data automatically. So if you only shot in RAW in the past so you could correct lens errors in software, now you can stick with shooting JPG and still get corrected images. I still shoot in RAW for the extra color control.Finally, some nit-picky complaints:- There is no way to completely turn off the backlighting for the main screen like you can in the E-5. You can turn off live view image and the menu so the screen is blank, but even then the screen's backlighting remains on whenever the camera is turned on (so it's still draining the battery). The only time the backlighting goes off is when your eye comes up to the viewfinder (which is nice). With such a small battery, this is a dumb design. I hope Olympus fixes it with a firmware update.- The shutter release is VERY sensitive. I've occasionally taken two of three photos when I intended to take only one (and yes, the drive setting was set to single exposure). Just hesitating as I release my finger from the shutter release button can trigger one or two additional shots. On the positive side, the camera can reel off a burst of photos as fast as the new iPhone 5S (10/sec) and the super fast focus means they are all sharp.- On a camera at this price, Olympus should have included GPS in the camera. The smartphone app works, but it requires you keep the app open and running on your phone (albeit in the background) for the entire time you are shooting pictures, so that the app can log your location data during the period you were taking pictures and then pass that logged data to the camera at a later point. Cumbersome to say the least. Look Olympus, if you're gonna charge $1,500 for a compact DSLR body, you can afford to put a freakin' $1 GPS chip in the camera body!- Olympus includes a compact camera-style flash accessory you can attach on the hotshot. It's designed to be removed from the camera when not in use, so it's a bit of a pain (though they do include a nice velvet carry pouch that velcros to your strap). I haven't used the flash yet. One benefit of the EM-1's high ISO performance is almost never needing a flash anyway. Obviously, there are times with a flash is required (for very low light or to fill shadows, etc.), but this little flash probably isn't going to be the one you want to use on an expensive body like this, so if you need flash, plan on buying one of Olympus' big off-camera flashes. I wish Olympus had made the included flash an accessory and just cut $150 off the EM-1 price.- The EM-1 screen doesn't articulate outward to the side of the camera (so it can be seen by the subject) or folded back against the body to protect the screen (like the E-5). It's limited to simply angling up or down. Not sure how much I will miss the extra flexibility, but I do hate to see it go.

Bush", "ReviewID": "R3KTSK03TTFC2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera just this morning...and I am beyond amazed. My background in photography started in 1983 with a Pentax K1000 (anyone remember those? If the battery was dead, it still took photos, you just lost the exposure meter!). In the late 1980s, I paid my way through college earning money as a used camera and photo gear dealer.  Since then, I've been more of an advanced amateur photographer (I received a degree in photography as part of a double major, but have never been paid for my work)...just enjoying it as my hobby.My experience with the MFT system began with a Lumix GF1, followed by a GX1, G3, G5, and then a G6 (for some reason I still have all these). So the E-M1 is my first Olympus MFT body. I've enjoyed the evolution and improvement of the Lumix bodies, and I've accumulated a nice collection of MFT optics.I have been reading about the E-M1 for two months since I placed my pre-order. I had even pre-ordered an extra battery, and had it charged and ready to go so I wouldn't have to wait when the E-M1 arrived! For most of the first day, I've was unable to put the E-M1 down. I went through most of the customizable settings (wow, just wow), and made adjustments and customizations to suit me.This camera has by far the most flexibility of any I've experienced...certainly the most customizable.  In my hands, the camera feels like a professional tool.  The weight, the speed of the focus and the feel of the shutter...all very subjective, but the focus is fast...faster than any other MFT camera I've owned.  And the shutter has a different, quieter and more precise sound and feel.  It certainly makes my G6 feel very amateurish.It also has some features I've not seen before, but they are features which I look forward to testing and using.  A great example of one of these features is called \"Live Time\", where you can watch a specifically untimed, long exposure as it develops and then stop the exposure when you are satisfied with the image.  Think of this as a \"bulb\" setting that allows you an unprecedented view of the exposure as it occurs.Another nice feature is the easy way for connecting devices through wi-fi.  The E-M1 displays a QR code, which you simply scan with your device (on which you have already loaded the Olympus Image Share app).  I have two other wi-fi enabled cameras, and they are not nearly as user friendly setting this up.  For me, I use a number of different devices (Galaxy S4, iPad, etc), and I also configured it to work with my wife's phone and iPad (don't want to be locked down to one device).I have already rearranged my function buttons several times, trying to discern the most logical order (logical to me at least).  One of my favorites is having Fn2 set to focus peaking, since this button is right behind the shutter button.I've also briefly tested the camera with some of my favorite lenses - the Lumix 20mm f1.7, the Oly 45mm f1.8, and the Oly 75mm f1.8. I also tried a couple of different Lumix zooms, including the 100-300mm.I had recently shelved my beloved Lumix 14-45mm lens in favor of the newer and much more compact 14-42mm II lens.  But the 14-45mm is right at home on the E-M1...very nice size and balance combination.  I believe this will be my primary lens until the Oly 12-40 f2.8 is available.It seems that the E-M1 breathes new life into my lenses...but I believe it is probably the 5-axis IBIS that is making the real difference.  Obviously it is making a difference with my lenses that had no IS...like the Oly 45mm and the Oly 75mm.  I was pixel peeping yesterday and realized for the first time that my german shepherd has eye lashes!  The photosI've owned many, many cameras through the years...some which I seriously cherished (mostly Leicas). I've owned several DSLRs (mostly Canon and Pentax). But I can say with great confidence that the E-M1 is the most serious and capable photographic tool I've ever owned...and that is after just a couple of days use.The only negative comment I have so far is possibly the location of some of the function buttons...maybe I just need to get used to them.  In particular, there are two buttons near the lens base that are a little difficult to reach.  I feel like I'm really being a bit nitpicky even mentioning this though as I'm not sure what I would do to improve their locationI believe for the price, this camera represents a tremendous value.  Of course this is my opinion, but it is an opinion based on years of cameras.  I've owned plenty of less expensive cameras and some more expensive cameras...but for me, the E-M1 seems to hit the ball out of the park when considering value.*I commit to come back to this review and update it with my experiences both positive and negative for this camera.*UPDATEFocus Tracking:I shot a cross country running event in which two of my teenage children participated.  I'm not used to shooting sporting events, but I was excited about using the E-M1.  I shot completely in the focus tracking mode (mostly to satisfy my own curiosity).  After reviewing the photos, I can say that the focus tracking was very reliable.  It didn't always focus on the runner that I wanted, but at least one of the runners in each shot are in sharp focus.  I may not use this again, as I think I can do better getting a specific runner in focus.Improved Images:Regarding my earlier statement that the EM-1 seems to \"breathe new life into my lenses\", this is even more evident now that I've had more time with the camera and have reviewed more photos.  At first I attributed this to the 5-axis IS, but now I attribute the improvements not only to the IS, but also to having no AA filter, having an improved sensor, and the automatic removal of CA (jpeg, of course) ...even on my Panasonic lenses.I plan to do a head to head comparison between the E-M1 and my G5 or G6.  I really want to compare the CA under varying conditions.  If I'm able to do this comparison, I'll post the results here.Other observations:The small rubber cover on the base of the camera covering the vertical grip contacts is difficult for me to remove.  Too, it has already started splitting/tearing.  I've removed and replaced this cover a number of times to utilize the vertical grip.I wish that the eyepiece protruded more from the rear of the camera, so that I didn't have to press my nose into the display to see through the viewfinder.  The best camera I own in this regard is the G3.  The G3 eyepiece protrudes \u00bc\" further than the eyepiece on the E-M1.  Maybe the (soon to be available) EP-13 eyepiece will help with this.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply the best m4/3 camera in the market.", "Author": "Cajie B \"cajie\"", "ReviewID": "RAZZX4GB5P3ZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a Nikon FX shooter (D800).

It is an expensive camera body that will make you want to buy different lenses to further improve your non existent skills. It may even make you want to learn more about photography. At least, that is what has happened for me in the past 5 days of using this camera. The price has killed me internally, but has been well-worth the amazing images out of the box. I am very frugal, so buying this camera was way out of my comfort zone.It has a steep learning curve if you want to pursue additional features, but otherwise, you truly can use it as an automatic point and shoot. The low light performance is amazing, and I am very pleased with how in near darkness, I can get great images of my kids playing in their forts. I am excited to see what kind of images I can get on Halloween night - no more grainy shots without a flash, and no more washed out ghouls and Freddie Krugers like from the old days with my flash on the old camera. You can get a lot of results without the flash.I am also using it to record video of performances. Again - much improved results in low light. I wouldn't ditch my video recorder just yet, but it is impressive what I am able to record.Do yourself a favor and do not get anything smaller then the 32g removable storage if you plan on using lots of video and or shooting in sports mode with burst speeds.Trust me. - remember, I told you wouldn't lie. You are better off splurging for at least 64gb.Sports setting - This will shoot at 10 frames per second. When shooting my son's football game last night, I realized the fast frames per second went almost faster than I could see. I was looking through the view finder and shooting the action, but was worried that the images wouldn't come out. They were crisp and perfect, and while I dumped 70% of the shots, 30% were great action shots that left this parent really pleased.The Wifi connection is wonderful and I was able to control the camera from my phone  - that will be helpful if we try to do a holiday self-portrait this year - no more setting the camera on a 10 second timer and racing to get into the photo.One added bonus  - I look better in photos from this camera then with the last camera. Not younger or thinner - just better.We like to hike and bike, and this camera is perfectly portable. The footprint is so much smaller, so it is easy to lug it around. In fact, you won't feel as if you are lugging anything around. The weatherproofing is a bonus, and I hear that they tested the camera after it was buried in snow for 15 minutes, and it still performed perfectly. Don't take it swimming - but you can bring it out into the elements with no adverse affects.Because of the expense, I would suggest finding out the return policy before you buy and try.

For me, this camera scratched every itch.  I have shot just about 60% of the major DSLR-like cameras over the last 10 years. My most fulfilling cameras so far had been the Nikon D2X, the Fuji S2, and the original Canon 5D. My \"big\" camera for the last couple years has been the Canon 60D, which was smartly designed, expertly built, and a great shooter. But still, I kept moving on from each of these fine cameras.

Just by virtue of not being Canon or Nikon it'll be a bit of a reach for some higher end photographers.  I don't expect Olympus to take over the pro market with this camera.

I came from an E-PL5 which I loved and cannot recommend highly enough, but after a year of usage I was ready for the next level up.

I have the 45mm f1.8, the 75mm f1.8, the 20mm f/1.7, and the 12mm f/2.0 which all worked amazing with the E-PL5 - but the E-M1's extra grip, WiFi features for your iPhone & iPad, the aforementioned extra axis of image stabilization are huge additions. Other favorite items are not having to dig through software menus for Aperture and Shutter Speed controls, the balance from counterweight when using a large lens like the 75mm, the viewfinder and included flash (and not having to choose between the two for one hotshoe), the several shots per second you can take in rapid fire to capture the moment without blinking or motion blur.This feels like a pro DSLR in every way to me, but with lenses that are considerably more affordable, and a size that fits in my wife's purse or slung over my shoulder easily. 5 Stars.-------------Updated now that I had some more time to write. 12/2/13-------------A year ago I decided to get more serious about taking photos. I've always loved photography and I took classes in college, I used to do bottle shots in the Napa wine industry, and I love portraiture. There was one problem: I hate lugging around a DSLR and lenses, I hate how much DSLR lenses cost, and I always end up shooting everything fun in my life with my iPhone unless go leave the house thinking \"today is a day dedicated to shooting photos.\" I hate using a flash and taking terrible flat photos with a DSLR, I hate having to use a flash because the only lens I could afford had an unacceptably high f-stop floor (anything above f/2.0 is unacceptable to me).This lead to my Canon Rebel XT sitting in the closet for months at a time. After hearing of the advancements and affordability in the Micro 4/3 standard of camera and lenses, I decided to take the plunge. I decided to invest in a new camera so that I could have with me without it being an event in itself, one that people would not be intimidated by when I point it at their faces, one that has an affordable but killer range of lenses available.That camera was the Olympus E-PL5. It's been a great year with the E-PL5, and I've taken the best pictures of my life with it for a fraction of the cost of a DSLR, without sacrificing any tangible quality (to my eyes). In fact, I would say the quality is actually better and more fully realized since I can now afford a wealth of lenses with much greater ease and no guilt! I now have a full range of amazing lenses to use with it from 24mm - 150mm (in micro 4/3 parlance that would be 12mm-75mm, you simply divide by 2).Also notable is that I do not buy any lens with an f-stop floor over f2.0 - this keeps me able to shoot excellent  photos in natural light even indoors with no flash required at ISO 800-1600. I never go higher than that because I hate noise in my photos. And this also means that since I require lenses at f/2.0 or below, that I will only shoot prime lenses - no zooms. This means I zoom with my feet, not with the barrel of the lens. It's an adjustment but ultimately worth it for the types of things I like to shoot.I just the sold the E-PL5 and am now rocking an Olympus E-M1, which has many similar components within it but is pretty much improved all around. It has excellent improved 5-axis image stabilization which makes my grip on the camera even steadier, enabling me to work with slightly slower shutter speeds at lower ISOs, reducing noise and the necessity of using a flash in low light. It has dedicated hardware knobs for adjusting shutter speed, aperture and ISO - so no more taking my eyes off the viewfinder to dig through software to adjust. It's got a ridiculously rugged magnesium alloy exterior and is weather proof, freeze proof and dust proof. It can connect to iOS devices through a wifi network it spawns itself, no external network needed. And best of all, my lenses still work with it.Can't recommend the micro 4/3 camera world enough. I wrote this because I have never been happier shooting photos in my life, and if I were me before this photographic evolution, I would want to read this review.The E-M1 is the best experience the Micro 4/3 world has to offer.

I have used the 5DM3 for a couple of years, so can speak from experience. Is it better? Obviously not. However, you're seeing this latest batch of mirrorless cameras get really close.A few practical observations:1. I found the ISO to be quite good at 3200, and somewhat useful at 6400. Being able to take great shots at ISO 3200 means that it is very good in low light situations.2. It supports back-button focus. I use the Fn1 button on the back to continuous focus, and half-press the shutter button for exposure. I can even use the directional buttons on the back to select my focus point. This mimics the way I used my 5D3.3. It supports magnification and manual focus peaking. There is a lever on the back you can set to switch between continuous and single-shot focus. When you are in single, you can auto-switch to manual focus by turning the focus on the lens. I have one button in the front set to enable/disable peaking, and the other to enable/disable magnification. This makes manual focus very easy! Basically use auto-focus to get close, and then tweak manual focus to perfection.4. Amazing EVF. In my opinion, there is not a lot of difference between a high-end EVF and an optical viewfinder. I don't even think about it anymore. And the fact that you can see real-time what is hitting the actual sensor has a lot of advantages.5. Great ergonomics. It will take me a little time to get used to it, but overall everything seems relatively easy to find. Very intuitive and customizable. I believe it will take me very little time to get used to this!I think this camera, as well as some of the other new mirrorless cameras (a7r, gx7, etc), are game changers. The year 2013 is when mirrorless got very close to the extremely high end of the DSLR market. When will they be better? certainly by 2015-2016.

I previously owned Canon SLRs, but I wanted a high performance camera in a much lighter and smaller package than SLRs, which means I needed a micro Four-thirds mirrorless (mFT) sold by either Olympus or Panasonic.  Yes, there are other mirrorless high performance cameras of similar size and weight, but they only use SLR lenses that are heavy and bulky, unlike mFT lenses.  In contrast, the E-M1 has both camera and lenses that are much lighter and smaller than equivalent featured SLRs.  Note: some SLRs might be almost as small and light as mFT like the E-M1, but only if the SLR is a very slow, featureless, hard-to-see viewfinder, bottom-of-the-line camera that's mounted with a very slow and less durable lens.  Some of the outstanding features of the E-M1 are superfast autofocus, its electronic viewfinder (EVF), and the 5-axis in-body stabilization.  I like the E-M1's EVF much more than the optical viewfinders from the SLR cameras I owned before.  For instance, when lighting is not bright, you can actually see better through an EVF than an optical viewer that can't brighten the view like an EVF.  Another reason is that an optical viewer can't show you the effects of your adjustments.  For instance, the optical viewer won't show your white balance or exposure adjustments.  I really like that I see my changes in the viewer.  The in-body stabilizer (called 5-axis IBIS) is far better than cameras without stabilizers.  Which means you need to pay more money for each lens to have its own stabilizers, which also adds extra size and weight.  I'm just giving you a few of the many, many features of this terrific camera.  In sum, you will find that no other camera provides the same level of high level features in a similar size and weight and lenses size and weight.  Lastly, some of you are probably wondering about buying the Olympus E-M5, which I also own.  The E-M5 is also a terrific camera, with a very slight advantage in weight and size.  If you're an advanced photographer who will use telephoto lenses and want a built-in, substantial grip, and you want maximum flexibility in selecting most camera functions from easily accessed buttons, then buy the E-M1.  Also, the E-M1 has improved continuous autofocusing versus the E-M5.Otherwise save some bucks and buy the E-M5.  They both have won several \"camera of the year\" awards when each was released.  I saved the best for last:  the image quality is outstanding and will allow you to enlarge photographs up to 16\"x20\" or larger with equal image to most any SLR.  And with the portability of the E-M1, you'll be carrying it with you most all the time, rather than a heavy, bulky SLR that gets left behind.  I have stopped using my Canon SLR since I'm tired of toting it around. The E-M1 matches or exceeds my Canon, so it's a no-brainer to go with the mFT Olympus E-M1.  By the way, for those of you who are sometimes outside on the beach or like to photograph when there's a mist or drizzle in the air, both the E-M1 and E-M5 have fabulous weathersealing from dust and moisture/rain.

I hope the objective nature of my mini-review serves to show that I am, in fact, just a dude who really likes his camera (but wants to make some things known for other potential buyers).My quick, overall thoughts:I fall mostly in line with the top two reviews posted for this camera, namely Steve Huff, who thinks that the E-M1 can go toe to toe with larger bodies, larger sensors and larger names. In terms of IQ, the E-M1 is largely indiscernible from the best APS-C cameras (and only about a half a stop worse on both ends than the full frame Nikon D600, according to Ming Thein). I've owned a Canon t3i, a Panasonic GH3, a Nikon D7000, a Fuji X100 and a Canon 5DMkII and the E-M1 takes pictures that look as good or better than any photos taken on any of my other bodies (good glass providing, of course). It's got the best JPG engine (Fuji is a close second) and the most accurate color reproduction I've ever seen. Dynamic range is outstanding. I think photos are completely usable through ISO 4000 and still good at ISO 6400 (especially for black and white). Put simply: it takes remarkable photos, some of the best I've ever seen, and is in fact quite good in real life low light situations (bars, nighttime street, etc.)Build quality, customization, EVF, etc., I'm with the consensus - best in the business, or very nearly there.DOWNSIDES I'VE NOT SEEN MENTIONED ALL THAT OFTEN:- The battery door, while not in itself weak, is connected by a small, weak, limp feeling spring. This is true of all E-M1's I've picked up and used. It's not *bad*, per se, just out of line with the incredible feel of the rest of the camera. I'm always careful of it swapping out cards.- Focus peaking introduces serious lag into the system. It takes the refresh rate all the way down to (it seems) around 20 frames per second, and makes the camera less pleasing to use (especially when you're used to the outrageously high refresh rate with focus peaking toggled off). It's still a highly useful feature, one that I use quite often with legacy lenses, but it can be kind of an eye sore seeing it jump and jerk a bit.- Some menu items are BURIED. They aren't used all that often, of course, but a couple useful features are obscurely labeled and buried many menus deep. Want to turn off IBIS for tripod mounting? Good luck! (the first time around, of course; like all things, you learn your way around).- Long exposure noise. I guess. If you turn noise reduction off, then jack your ISO up to 6400, then shoot a 60 second exposure in the dark, you get hot pixels and salt and pepper noise. A very vocal minority is frustrated (and they of course have a right to feel this way) because this wasn't the case on the E-M5 (though I believe that's because the E-M5 was doing some sort of real time NR processing, even with NR turned off). This is an \"issue\" 99.9% of users will never encounter. I shoot long exposure all the time. I keep NR on. It's viable for 99% of long exposure applications, and no, it's not a \"work around\" - it's there because that's how the camera is designed to perform. Every other camera on the market has quirks this bad or worse. It's reallllly a non-issue.- The electronic level, though great, can't be displayed simultaneously with other operational information. So no level + histogram, no level + current setting readout on screen, etc. It works a treat and is a joy to use, but it'd be nice to use it in conjunction with other tools. That was one of my favorite parts about the GH3!SOME PROS NOT OFTEN MENTIONED:- VIDEO! I'm a video guy. I'm a television editor by trade and frequently shoot commercials or wind up assisting in some way with cameras on local short film shoots. I've shot on RED, the Sony FS line, Canon C100, Panasonic AG-AC130A, the BMPCC, all manor of DSLRs and DSLMS (including the Canon 5D series and the Panasonic GH line) and even old betacams. In short, I spend a lot of time shooting, working with or looking at video. And the E-M1 is an awesome little video camera.I feel like people looked at the spec sheet, saw that it only shot 24Mpbs/30p and said, \"WELP! NOT A VIDEO CAMERA!\" The SOOC video on this thing looks great! It's crisp and clean, with no noticeable mud or macro blocking (even with a busy scene). Does it stand up to grading the way the GH3 or the high bitrate Sony A7 video does? No. But some light adjustments, post sharpening, and a LUT like FilmConvert are absolutely in the cards.The big benefit to video, though, is the IBIS. This is the only digital stills camera you can use as an honest to goodness handheld shooter without any other accessories. The Canon 70D with 24-105 IS doesn't even come close in terms of stability. The E-M1's IBIS is like having a built in steadycam, only it works with any lens. I shot a short on it last weekend using my Dad's old Canon FD lenses. Crazy.- Portability. Compared to a DSLR (or even the Panasonic GH line), this thing is tiny. And compared to all the tripods, monopods, shoulder mounts, etc. you need to carry with you when you don't have built in stabilization, this is the most portable camera I've ever used. I pack a small bag with my E-M1, my 12 f/2, my 17 1.8, my 25 1.4, and a couple spare cards + battery and go shooting. It's awesome. Totally removes the \"chore\" part of photography. My whole bag, fully kitted is less than five pounds!- The system. If you shoot video + stills, and you don't have $15,000 to spend on a camera body, you need to be a micro four thirds shooter. It's the best hybrid camera system ever designed. The glass is great. The primes are small. A number of companies are backing its production. It's got a long life ahead of it. Buy in.IN SHORT:Buy it. It's my favorite camera I've ever used.

The camera is heavily electronic, with EVF, back screen , IBIS and Autofocus.IBIS (In Body Image Stabilization)  is stunningly effective - I can hand hold 1/3 sec or even longer and get sharp results.The EVF is so good it's like having night vision. almost everything is customizable so you can adapt the camera to however you like working.If you use a tripod - you can turn off the IBIS, if you want buttons to do this or that - you can. if you want to save a set of camera settings/configurations and restore them , you can.if you shoot wildlife - get the Olympus 75-300 (it's like having a 150-600mm lens on a Full frame / 35mm camera)you get high performance at a relatively low cost and can carry the camera and lens w/o breaking your backOn camera Wifi - works great, you can directly transfer from camera to phone , you can remote control the camera from the phone etc...minor complaints - Olympus could ditch the art modes - no need to complicate the camera with them, you tend to use them once, laugh and then move on - put them on the phone app maybe for post processing, add GPS directly to the camera  (now available via the phone app).I can't say enough about this camera - I'm selling my D800 and pro NIkon lenses - it's that good for most purposes.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great camera with a steep learning curve", "Author": "Dave Romm", "ReviewID": "RZU2B9FOCU72Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Warning:  The OM-D E-M1  is not for the faint of heart.  It takes excellent photos when it does what I expect, which isn't all the time.  The controls have a steep learning curve, which I haven't climbed yet.  I'm going to give it five stars on the assumption that I'll climb that mountain.Pros:* Takes great photos, if you know what you're doing.* Battery let's you take at least 300 photos per charge, even with some flash.* Fast shutter delay; very responsive (even if you don't want it to be).* Can change settings on the fly quickly, if you know what you're doing.* Six-hour sleep; you don't have to turn the camera off most of the time.* iPad/Smartphone app works pretty well via WiFi, if you know what you're doing* Olympus tech support is excellent.* Lightweight and strong, even with a lens attached, with an easy grip.* LED screen is very good and shows a greed deal of information.* Viewfinder is excellent.Cons* Pricey.* Steep learning curve.  Even on \"auto\" you have to know a little about the controls.* Buttons are so sensitive that you can easily change settings or take unwanted photos.* Included added flash is only okay.* Lens designed to be bundled with this camera isn't out as of this writing (10/14/13) and will be pricey.I've had the camera for more than two weeks, and have gone through two batteries to take several hundred photos (look for me on Facebook), so feel I can comment, from a mid-level user's perspective.  Most cameras I've owned have powerful controls, but if you just want to set it to \"Auto\" and take pics, a beginner can do it.  Not so this camera.The default settings for the OMD1 (how I tend to refer to it) are for the high-end user... with some odd exceptions.  The arrow buttons change the focus.  This is incredibly annoying, given how sensitive the buttons are, and if you don't pay attention the focus point will be waaaay off very easily.  You can change how the arrow buttons work, but that reduces a great deal of the ease of the Live Screen controls.  There is no command to lock the focus.  Meanwhile, the default for the lever is \"off\".  If you want to use the AF or HDR buttons to change the flash settings, you have to go into the menus and turn on the lever.Most of the menu commands and settings have at least three ways of accessing them.  This is good, as you'll probably want to turn off one or two.  If you set it up right, one button gets you access to flash settings, HDR exposures, etc.  The front and back dials give you control of two aspects on one screen.  The touch screen commands take a delicate touch, but work well.  I haven't even played with the function buttons yet.The upside to the very sensitive controls: Almost no shutter delay.  The OMD1 is very responsive.  This is not always a good thing, if you happen to hit a button at the wrong time or chose the wrong setting by mistake.  A little care is required.Turning on the camera wakes it up quickly, but you don't even have to do that; \"sleep\"k kicks in after a minute (by default) and lasts 6 hours, so merely touching a button wakes it up.  The battery has to handle a lot, but so far each charge has lasted over 300 shots.  Haven't tried energy draining aspects like HDR combinations or RAW.The manual is very good, and Olympus tech support is excellent (1-800-201-7766 press 1 (maybe))).The viewfinder is great, though I usually use Live View.Every now and then, the camera does something odd (such as take a photo for 2 seconds) that I didn't set up and don't quite understand why.  I'm assuming that all will become clear in the fullness of time.  This is mostly in low-light situations where the flash hasn't decided what to do.L SF (Large/Super Fine)  .jpg compression puts it at resolution of 350 and smaller height x width, which means I have to massage the files in Photoshop more than I want to, even for simple Facebook uploads.  This is the setting that gives the most info this side of RAW (according to tech support) and so what I, in theory, want.  The excellent compression and great focusing mean the extra steps in Photoshop are worth the results.When the camera is doing what I expect, the images are excellent.  Massaged in PS, they come out very nice.  Sharp and clean.The focusing works spectacularly well.  I'm not sure how the AE works.  It seems to be about a quarter f-stop off, at least for the people's faces when the background is lighter.  I hope to figure out how to highlight the faces better.WiFi connection via app to my iPad works, but is also non-intuitive.  The app is brand new, just released, an update of a previous Olympus app. The connection, which should be simple, is handled strangely:  The \"Connection to Smartphone\" is in a different menu than the settings for wifi connection, and you can't get out of the wifi screen when it's on.  You either use the camera manually OR connect via WiFi.  You have to change some settings on the iPad to connect and to allow access to the files on the camera.My standard lens is the M.Zuiko ED 12-50mm f3.5-63.  This lens works fine, as does the ED 40-150 zoom I also got.  The newer Micro 4/3rd lens designed for the OMD1 isn't out yet, and the price makes me hesitate.  If I get a third lens, it's likely to be the 45mm f1.8.  But let me get used to the camera before I start collecting lenses.So:  final word, for now:  An exceptionally good camera that takes great photos... when the symbiosis between photographer and equipment is complete.  I do not yet grok the OMD1. I am going to give it five stars because the small camera takes great pictures.

I have an Olympus e-510 that was showing its age and this past summer I acquired a Nikon D7100 in the kit 2 lens package.  Compared to the e-510, the Nikon was big and heavy (my old camera bag wasn't big enough for the Nikon gear - I was surprised by just how much larger the D7100 was). The D7100 had nice features that my e-510 was lacking, but in the end, the image quality just didn't impress me. Plus, the thing was really heavy!  I took it on a photography weekend workshop and by the end of the weekend I was wishing for my e-510.

I'm still using all of my old four-thirds lenses, but I think I'll be buying some micro FT lenses as soon as I can afford it!My biggest concern about moving to this camera was the EVF.

Dusty, hot and humid environment, shooting thousands of RAW files over two weeks.It performed flawlessly. The autofocus speed and accuracy proved itself as reliable, the in body image stabilisation better than any optical image stabilisation I've ever used. The weather sealing is amazing. Whilst water is one thing, sticky humid weather and dust is another (muddy) kettle of fish.

Whilst the Sony's are a similar sized body, the full frame lenses are still much larger (read HEAVIER) than the micro four thirds lenses. The narrow depth of field, or extra light benefits of full frame systems are not as necessary as one might expect. I don't find myself in situations wishing I still had full frame system. However, for years I wished my full frame camera's were smaller and lighter.The image quality, or more '16 megapixel size' from the micro four thirds is ample. I haven't found a single photo that hasn't had the resolution I need for print, or digital use.The battery life is the only thing I wish were a little better, however it's really only when i'm smashing photos out of the camera that I notice it; for regular use the battery life is fine.People I've spoken to seem think there has to be a trade-off for a compact system.

Shin", "ReviewID": "RRFZC2T7PN5M6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background info:  I'm just an amateur photographer but as with many folks, I'm really into photography.  I've used a lot of cameras over the years (Nikon, Sony, Ricoh, some Canon, some Pentax), but for the past several years, have used Olympus  (E-5, Pens, E-M5 and now E-M1).2.  So with the above disclaimer, here are my random thoughts in regards to this camera.Re:  Imaging:  you can read dpreview on the technical details and differences between the current m43 cameras (including E-M5) vs E-M1.  But from an observational point of view, there are more similarities than differences between the various m43 cameras, especially with the E-M5 vs E-M1 (in regards to image quality).  Hopefully, most people will acknowledge and accept that you can create a great image with most all (I'm going to say 100%) of today's interchangeable cameras (Sony NEX, Fuji, Panasonic, Olympus and all of the DSLRs etc...).  As such, there is no reason to get the E-M1 if your primary goal is to improve the quality of your images.  You should be able to create quality images with any current digital camera out there (ie mirrorless / DSLR).Re:  Focus:  Along the line of my comments in regards to imaging, there are more similarities than differences between various cameras in regards to focusing speed.  Of course, you'll always have the fastest focusing camera out there, but is the E-M1, \"fast enough\"?  With a native lens, focusing will not be a problem... in most situations ( I don't have any pragmatic knowledge to comment on C-AF and things of that nature and I'm going to assume that if you're into bird photography or sports;  you're not even thinking about this camera in the first place).  There is one big improvement with the E-M1 over the previous Olympus m43 cameras in that the autofocusing for 4/3 lens is vastly improved.  In that I love my 12-60mm & 50-200mm Olympus lens (4/3 mount) and since I hated the autofocus performance of those lens on the E-M5, I was very interested to see if the \"hype\"of improved autofocus speed for the 4/3 lens was actually true on the E-M1.  Well, I agree with most assessments out there;  ie there is a definite improvement over the E-M5, but it's not as good compared to the lens being mated to a 4/3 DSLR.  Ok, but what in the world does that really mean?  Ultimately, it's one of those things where you'll to view various youtube comparisons or better yet, somehow try it out at the store.  I'm still in the process of figuring out how / what this is going to mean to me.  I do like the 12-60mm, but since it doesn't focus as fast as a native m43 lens (I just ordered the 12-40mm) and since the native m43 lens is probably going to be just as good / similar to the 4/3 lens (in this case the 12-60mm), I'm going to assume that over time, I'm just going to use all m43 lens on the E-M1\u2026 which is probably what the folks at Olympus is thinking or projecting or hoping for.  On the otherhand, I'll probably use the 12-60mm for situations where I need the extra reach (and not want to carry an additional lens)  etc\u2026  But the bottomline is, for those die hard 4/3 users, this camera does a decent enough job of autofocusing the 4/3 lens that it's probably worthwhile to get this camera (and then overtime, you'll become a convert to the m43 lens as well\u2026).Re:  Ergonomics:  When the E-M5 came out, Iiked the look, but the ergonomics was... lacking, because of the minimal grip... which was answered via the optional battery grip thing (which is a well made product).  But, I just prefer to have the camera itself built to have the grip and thus I do strongly feel that the E-M1 is an improvement over the E-M5 in regards to ergonomics.  The grip is of a perfect size (of course for my hands), the camera feels solid, and it's substantive enough to comfortably carry the 12-60mm and even the 50-200mm (I was surprised with this, but it's true... obviously use common sense when carrying the rig around).Re:  Performance:  Along with improved autofocusing for the 4/3 lens and improved ergonomics (grip), the improvement in performance was the main reason I decided to move up from the E-M5 to E-M1.  I realize for some folks, this may not be an issue, in such case, don't waste your money buying a new camera.  But for me, the mediocre performance of the E-M5 was a constant minor annoyance.  Specifically, the relatively small buffer was a pain in the butt.  I would shoot a burst of images (RAW), but then would  have to wait for the camera to write the data to the card prior to resuming burst shooting.  Or, I could keep shooting, but of course at a snails pace.  With the E-M1, the camera is no longer a limitation in regards to the above;  I haven't done any serious testing,  but the E-M1 definitely has a much larger buffer.  I can shoot a lot of frames prior to the camera slowing down, and when it slows down, the write time is a lot quicker.Re:  Bottomline Thoughts:  My beginning and final word on this camera is \"awesome\".  Of course there haven't been that many m4/3 cameras made thus far (via Olympus), but I can say that it's definitely their best digital product thus far (m43 and regular 4/3).  This is the camera that most open minded photographers were - have been - are looking for from Olympus;  ie a relatively compact, well built, high performance camera with great ergononics and high possibility for producing excellent images.  All of course supported by the awesome Olympus len line up.  This camera really hits most of the important \"check marks\" that most serious photographers are interested in;  not all, but most.

This is a professional grade camera body with excellent feel and just about any kind of adjustment and customization imaginable (expect a steep learning curve).  Image quality is excellent, and while it doesn't quite compete with full frame cameras, it comes close enough, at smaller size and weight, particularly when you include lenses in this comparison (the camera body has a good, solid feel, and isn't particularly light, but micro-4/3 lenses are much smaller and lighter than their full frame DSLR counterparts).  The in-body image stabilization (IBIS) works great, for all lenses including manual ones (you have to tell the camera the approximate focal length, but that's easily done).  Compared to my full frame DSLR, this Olympus shows more grain at high ISO settings (1600 and higher), but one can use lower ISO thanks to very effective IBIS (using longer exposures) or very fast lenses (as fast as f/0.95 -- which enables ISO 200 where ISO 1600 might have been required at f/2.8).

I think I\u2019ve found it.Comparing the Olympus, with the 12-40 micro 4/3 zoom lens, with the Nikon D-3s, with the Nikon 24-70mm zoom \u2013 what I consider to be my \u201cnormal\u201d lens for this camera \u2013 attached, the Nikon outfit weighs in at eight pounds; the Olympus is about 1/3 the size and weighs two-and-a-half pounds.  If you were walking around, say, Boston, where I\u2019m taking our family for a long weekend and a Red Sox game next summer, which would you rather be carrying?  And, the Olympus camera+lens combination comes at about one-third the price of what I have invested in the equivalent Nikon setup.Add to that, the OM-D is a great camera, and I\u2019m very impressed with its features and results.  For example, I purchased the 75-300mm micro 4/3 zoom lens for it, which would be the full frame equivalent of a 150-600mm.  Add to that, the OM-D has a \u201cdigital 2x tele-converter\u201d menu feature.  So, with that camera, that lens, and the digital tele-converter feature (which is nothing more than an in-camera crop, really) that takes you all the way out to 1200mm, if my math is correct.  I shot a backyard squirrel at that setting and granted, it did not come out tack sharp, but it\u2019s not bad for just \u201cmessing around.\u201dAll of that said, there is one little thing: the OM-D EM-1 menu is anything but intuitive, and the owner\u2019s manual that comes with the camera is somewhere next to useless.  The manual\u2019s table of contents and/or index will tell you, for example, that more information on a given function can be found at page 58.  But when you turn to page 58, guess what?  It\u2019s in French, Spanish, or one of the Pacific Rim languages\u2026apparently, the problem with having one publication serve multiple nationalities.  You can \u2013as I did \u2013 download all 163 pages of the on-line edition of the owners manual.  It is complete but still difficult to use and to me, often creates more questions than it answers.What the owners of the OM-D EM-1 really, really need is for David Busch to hurry and publish one of his excellent guides for this particular camera.  (And in case you\u2019re thinking of ordering the Busch guide for the OM-D EM-5 as a substitute, don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not that helpful).  While we are waiting for Busch to get with it, if you\u2019d like to understand which button does what on the OM-D EM-5, I highly recommend the QuickPRO Guide DVD for this model.  I found it very helpful and now actually kind of feel like I know what I\u2019m doing accessing this camera\u2019s menu and/or controls.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn\u2019t carry the QuickPRO Guide for the OM-D EM-1, but it\u2019s available from the Olympus website and probably elsewhere.For those who might be thinking, \u201cSo Ron, will you be putting your Nikons up for sale?\u201d the answer is not in this lifetime.  My main gripe against the mirrorless cameras, and the point-and-shoot models, is the lag between pushing the shutter button and the moment when a photo is actually taken. In this regard, I have dozens of photos of where a dolphin had just surfaced before diving again or an elk very recently had been standing against a forest background.  On the OM-D, however, the menu will let you choose either \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cshort\u201d for this interval.  Even though the \u201cshort\u201d option is supposed to use more battery, I chose it, and the lag is virtually non-existent.In my opinion, the full-frame Nikon still has it over the Olympus if you are shooting for publication, large gallery prints, or photos to be displayed on the internet.  If that\u2019s what you are up to, I believe you\u2019ll still want the full-frame Nikon or its Canon equivalent.All of that said, I do feel confident that I have at last found my \u201cwalking around\u201d camera.

Ellis \"dlellis6\"", "ReviewID": "R1BHKZ6PNRMY9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shooting Olympus cameras since 1978.  I have always loved the lenses.  With over 2,000,000 shots on my Olympus E-500 camera, I decided it was time to invest in a new camera.I was reluctant at first to try the EM-1 for three reasons:- The format is Micro-Four Thirds, not Four Thirds.  I take 99% of my photos in the telephoto range, and that is what Four Thirds was optimized to use.  Micro-Four Thirds is geared more towards wide angle lenses.- The camera is mirrorless and uses an electronic Viewfinder (EVF).- I have to use a converter to mount my existing Four Thirds lenses, and converters have a very bad history.Out of the box:The first thing that you notice when you pull the body out is that it is SOLID.  The thing feels like it is built like a tank.  I have not tried the \"splashproof\" and other claims, but just holding this body I can believe them.  The camera fits well in my hand.  My hands are a little large, and my pinky occasionally slides off the bottom.  I may buy the grip/extra battery holder later if this proves to be a problem.  YMMV.Using Four Thirds lenses:I have no Micro Four Thirds lenses and a lot invested in Four Thirds lenses, so using them was a key issue.  Olympus has 1/17 or 1 MP of the sensor dedicated to phase detection auto focus, the only type of auto focus that will work with these lenses.  I find that the system works very well.  Focusing is fast and accurate.Mounting the converter is easy, as expected.  Once mounted, you use a button on the side to release the lens.  This is a learning issue since I still normally hit the lens release button on the camera body.  I anticipate little real problems with this since as soon as I try to put the cover on the back of the lens I realize my error.Balance with the 12-60 mm Four Thirds lens is excellent.  Holding the lens by the zoom collar, the weight is only slightly behind my left hand.  I only have to support the body lightly with my right hand.  I personally like that balance.  Longer lenses like the 70-300 are also well balanced.EVF:I have used a mirrored SLR since 1978 and a rangefinder 35 mm camera and 126 film P&S; cameras before that.  As you might guess, I favor a direct view to see what I am shooting.  EVF have issues with resolution and lag when moving to a different point of interest or following a subject, especially in low light.The EVF has turned out to be great.  I really like Olympus' implementation.  There is some lag, but it is generally minimal.  The \"What You See Is What You Get\" is a big plus in my book.  Adjust the exposure compensation or manual exposure settings, and the view in the EVF changes to reflect what the image will look like.  It is not perfect, but it gets 95%+ of what you will actually get.  The display of settings is bright, clear, crisp, large, and surprisingly unobtrusive.The EVF also allows a lot of changes in camera settings to be done without removing the camera from your eye.  Use the two dials, and you can see where the focus points that you are using are.  Hit the OK button on the back, and you can use the dials to adjust just about every setting while watching the selections you are making in the EVF.  Ditto with the other buttons like HDR and auto exposure mode.HDR:I had the opportunity to use in-camera HDR while on a recent trip.  The day was cloudy, and there was a lot of shadow against bright grey clouds.  The in-camera HDR used a series of shots at different exposures and combined them in the camera.  The results were better than HDR Pro in Photoshop CS5.5 IMO.  I was much, much happier with the dynamic range and overall look of the images.  the 10 fps shooting mode was also great for minimizing camera movement, ghosts and other problems associated with HDR.Image stabilization:The EM-1 has a five axis image stabilization system for the sensor.  That means any lens becomes can be used.  The fourth and fifth axes are for rotations.  One compensates for the slight turn of the camera that often occurs when you press the shutter button.  I had good success using IS in low light with my 70-300 mm lens set at 300 mm.Scenes:the EM-1 has many useful scene modes.  I used landscape and panorama with great success.  The artistic filters and story modes may also interest you.  I prefer to do those types of things in post-processing.ISO:The camera has an almost insane 25600 maximum ISO.  Yes, you get image quality degradation and noise at that ISO, but the in-camera JPEG processor can actually give you some relief from the problems at higher ISOs.  I so far have found shooting up to ISO 1600 produces no discerned degradation.  I tried ISO 6400 and found minimal issues.For those who started with film and were in love with the \"high ISO\" 1000 film for low light shooting, this is a major and welcome advancement.  For those newer to photography that have been using higher ISO cameras for a while, the speed may not be much of a gain, but the image quality should be.The low end ISO is 200, which is the new normal.  I do not find it to be a problem.  I would rather shoot at a faster shutter speed than have an ISO 100 setting in most cases.  There is an ISO LOW setting, but I do not plan to use it.  If you regularly shoot in bright light and want lower f-stops, invest in a neutral density filter.Back display:The back display is slightly disappointing.  It can only tilt up and down, not rotate so that you can see your composition when you are getting into the shot.  It works well for shooting over crowds or getting a low angle shot.On the plus side, the display is clear, bright and a touchscreen that can be used to select a point of interest for focusing and can be used to take the shot in live view mode.  You can also use it to select settings to change.  The next generation should be even better, and hopefully it will have a screen that rotates.SD card:One change from the E-500 that I do not like is the use of SD rather than CF cards.  CF cards are nearly indestructible, and a good Sansdisk Extreme card works virtually anywhere, anytime and is virtually impossible to physically break.  The xD card slot disappearing is no loss, but not having a second card slot is somewhat surprising given the high-end prosumer/professional positioning of this camera.Controls and customization:The controls are pretty well placed for me with the exception of the auto exposure lock button.  That is right beside the viewfinder and too far to the left for my liking.  You can do a lot of customization with the control buttons and dials, but there are limits.  I have not made any changes yet because I am still learning the camera.  Overall the defaults seem logical and useful.This camera has two dials, one on the front and one on the back.  The E-500 only had a back dial, so I am learning to use the two dial system.  They work well for adjusting and selecting options.  I think the second dial was a good addition.  Both are conveniently located for my fingers.Image quality:All of this is meaningless if the image you get out is bad.  The EM-1 does not disappoint.  I know that there are people who insist that they need 48 MP or some other ridiculously large number.  The reality is that 16 MP is a great size for printing full-size 300 dpi images on your printer or using a commercial photo printing service.  If all you do is screen displays, it is about eight times more pixels than you need for a typical 2 MP monitor.The quality of the EM-1 pixels is very high, and you get excellent out-of-the-camera RAW and JPEG images.  I have no problems seeing fine detail at 100% and higher magnifications.Summary:This camera is a winner, and it works with my existing Four Thirds lenses so I do not have to invest another $3000+ in lenses to use it.  I have a lot to learn, and it will take some time to get the most out of the camera, but out-of-the-box, using my E-500 techniques, it is already doing great work.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very, very capable camera (and system!)", "Author": "J. Smith", "ReviewID": "R3TSYLH5WWBQIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I start, let me say I'm pretty much a brand-agnostic shooter.  I've owned multiple Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Olympus, Panasonic, and Sony systems and like them all for their own strengths and weaknesses.  So, I write this review not as a fan-boy of any type, but just a person that loves camera gear :)That said, what is nice about the E-M1?  Surely if you're a prospective buyer, you've read countless reviews and accolades of the camera.  Though I'm not intending to repeat everything on the internet, I will just go over what stands out to me after a day of shooting with the camera (I received from Amazon yesterday).If we could rate half stars, I would rate this camera 4.5 stars.1) The ergonomics - They're pretty darn nice, actually.  The camera has a real grip, unlike a naked EM5.  I stand 6 feet tall with moderately large hands, and my pinky starts to slip off the bottom of the camera (half-on-half-off) but it's still a great feeling - very secure and no sense that I would drop it.  As of yet have not used the camera strap at all, just the bare camera and 20mm/1.7That said, the new grip does \"bulk up\" the camera slightly, compared to say my former EM5 or the GX1 I also have, but it's still certainly much smaller than my 6D.Control wheels feel very nice indeed, sure clicks.  The mode dial has a lock button that frankly I find nice but unneeded - that mode wheel is VERY firm and basically \"protected\" by the profile of the camera, and I'd be highly surprise if I ever, every accidentally change a mode -- I leave it unlocked!Buttons - I wish they were a bit clicky-er and less mushy.  They're not nearly as annoying as the EM5 buttons, but they are still a little too mushy for me.  Same with the shutter button - it's almost a hair trigger and very sensitive, but I got used to it pretty rapidly.2) Operation - So far, so good.  Yes, you have to get used to the byzantine Olympus menu system - get ready to study if you've never used Olympus before.  That said, I have pretty much warmed up to the things one can do with the Olympus menu and button customization.The \"2x2\" operation mode is AWESOME.  I love love love it, and while it takes some practice to get used to (to prevent changing one parameter, when you thought you were on another), overall it's so very useful.  My rear dial is aperture control, my front is EV comp - a flick of the switch on the back with my thumb, and the front becomes ISO, the rear WB (for me) -- just great.I also really love the flash sync speed and 1/8000s shutter - I've already put both to use just playing around and find them very nice.Olympus quirks still exist  - Press screen to get anywhere-AF box and you lose the histogram, etc, meaning you have to revert to normal \"joystick\" AF selection to get your histogram back.That said, the quirks are easily overtaken by the level of customizability.  I mean, one can save a Myset now and map it to a MODE DIAL setting!  Freaking awesome -- If you're like me and you NEVER use \"P\" mode, save yourself a Myset and map it there -- beautiful.AF seems fairly snappy, about as snappy as one can get with the 20/1.7 mounted.  My 12-40 arrives in a few days, so hopefully I can do a proper test to include some C-AF with tracking, etc.3) Image quality - So far it's about the same as the EM5.  Don't expect a massive upgrade in image quality.  That said, it's still a very, very capable camera and unless one is doing some extreme shooting, it should be able to handle almost anything the owner could throw at it.  JPEGs out of the camera look good.The EVF is very nice, but I'm not too picky when it comes to EVFs, so as long as I can use it, I'm happy.  I'm just as happy with my VF2 on my GX1 or even my former XE1's VF - again, I'm not too picky!The negatives - There are very few.  I really wish the body had the flash built-in, somehow.  I just hate the incredibly \"fiddly\" Olympus (included) flash setup because it consists of 4 different pieces one must juggle if you wish to mount the flash.  I would leave the included flash on, but it adds considerably to the top of the body, so typically I just keep it in my pocket, if I bring it at all.Panoramic mode is useless.  I mean, seriously, almost any other modern camera out today will be better if you want a quick pano stitch.Finally, peaking is very substandard.  You're given the choice of two colors to peak with, black and white, and they're typically very hard to see.  Also, peaking is a special \"mode\" that slows down the EVF frame rate, as if it's processing it like a complex Art filter or something.That said, the negatives are fairly minor for me, and the positives of the camera really outweigh the negatives.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera - an excellent upgrade to any similar body", "Author": "Elliot Bernstein", "ReviewID": "R317KLJ098JFSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to upgrade from my OMD EM5 knowing that IQ would probably really not be any better with the OMD EM1  (based on the review/comparison images I have reviewed.  I don't know if it is or not for sure (it does not appear to be) as I have not done any direct side-by-side comparisons but I can say that like the EM5, IQ from the OMD EM1 is excellent. Everything else about the camera appears to have been improved nicely over the EM5.The overall features have been reviewed extensively so I will not repeat them.  This review is details some of the improvements I really like and think you will enjoy over the EM5 and other similar bodies.1. Electronic ViewfinderWow!  It is so good that you almost can't tell it is electronic!  And it is noticeably larger than the EM5's and clearer/sharper.  If you like to use a viewfinder some of the time, you are absolutely going to love it - it is amazing!2. ErgonomicsThe feel and layout of everything is better than the OMD EM5.  The integrated grip is nice and you may not necessarily need the battery grip which I felt was necessary for the EM5.  I bought the grip and decided I did not want the extra weight on the camera and returned it.  I did order on Amazon (have not yet received) a plastic grip base made by J.B. Camera Designs.  It is non-functional (does not hold a battery and has no electronic connection with the camera) but will extend the base a bit and is a fraction of the price and weight of the genuine Olympus grip.  You can access the battery compartment and a tripod mount with this base on.3. VideoVideo quality (both video and audio) seems to be about the same as the EM5, although AF tracking seems a bit improved.  In my opinion, this camera cannot be used reliably to track moving subjects like you would use a regular camcorder but if you are shooting pro style video, it is fine.  Video quality itself is fine.  I have a 65\" HDTV and the video looks pretty good on it.  (The camera offers numerous quality settings for video - if you plan on watching the video on a large screen TV, make sure you select the highest quality setting - for online use, I don't think the quality setting is critical.)4. Focus PeakingI do a lot of manual focusing and love this feature.  You can really get a good feel for the DOF with it.  And of course you can manually focus quickly, effortlessly and accurately  I also use Nikon lenses with an adapter and unfortunately this feature does not function with those lenses.5. Battery LifeBattery life seems improved over the EM5.  I shot over 1000 images with the same battery I used on my EM5 (and there was still power to spare) and have never been able to shoot much over 300-400 images previously.6. Direction ButtonsThe four buttons around the OK button are greatly improved over the EM5 - I found them a bit small and the buttons on the EM1 are much improved.  I like the overall layout of all the dials and buttons.7. Larger BufferI am a RAW shooter and really appreciate the significantly larger buffer as compared to the OMD EM5.  I didn't fill it often, but there were many occasions when I would have appreciated a larger buffer, and the EM1 delivers.If a camera with small size, light weight, great image quality and full features is what you are looking for, the OMD EM1 is the one to get!

I am a pro with a successful photography business. I went to the 43 system after 3 Nikons with back focus issues. I just need to say thank you to Nikon because their mistakes pointed me toward the revolution. Got started with the EM5 and have never looked back. Canon and Nikon don't interest me in the least bit anymore. I have shot in every lighting situation and venue and these Olympus cameras have blown away my expectations. Pros are always worried about showing up to an event with smaller cameras and wonder what are people going to think. Well, let me say that people don't care and their looks alone have started more conversations than I can count. If you are worried about what people think about your camera size than you shouldn't be shooting. You should have already blown them away with your portfolio before you showed up. The EM1 takes all the best of the EM5 and just walks away with the 43 best camera crown. The EVF is a revelation and to you dslr people, imagine seeing that you got the shot without having to put the camera down. You can make the adjustments and see them real time in the viewfinder. I have shot every level of Nikon and Canon and yes my little 43 Olympus cameras produce a sharper image than any Nikon or Canon I have used. The contrast autofocus is blazingly fast and guess what Nikon? Never ever a back focus issue!

Starting with the grip and going to the phase detection auto focus on the sensor (first m43 camera to use PDAF), this is a camera that you can use as a dSLR replacement. The m43 cameras have always had fantastic contrast detection auto focus, which is faster and more reliable than phase detection auto focus, but contrast detection AF doesn't work well for sports or wildlife. Having PDAF on the sensor allows the E-M1 to be used in these situations. The only word of caution here is that, at the moment, neither Olympus nor Panasonic have released a great lens for longer focal lengths above 100mm, so at the moment, and until Olympus releases the new 40-150 (80-300 equivalent) and the promised long telephoto, this camera will have to justify itself at shorter focal lengths.Comparing it to other m43 cameras, it's a little bigger but not much heavier. Most of the heft is from the grip, which makes actually using the camera easier but also adds a bit of bulk. Image quality is not much improved over the E-M5 but image quality was not an issue with the camera. If I'm trying to be inconspicuous or doing something like hiking, where I know that taking snaps is not a priority, I'll take the E-M5. But if I know that I'm going somewhere where I'll be spending time on the photography I'll take the E-M1.The whole m43 system is reaching maturity. Right now the only hole in the lineup is at the higher end. Note the E-M1 allows you use lenses made for the original 43 mount with an adapter, and those lenses are some of the finest lenses ever made, with great image and build quality. Unfortunately, those lenses were relatively large and heavy, and while those lenses using the SWD motor drive seem to work well on the E-M1, early reports are that the older non-SWD lenses are a bit slow to AF. You also have to use an adapter for these lenses. That's not a big deal but it does add some bulk and weight and it costs a hundred bucks or so (not a significant cost given the cost and quality of these lenses).That's a system issue, which should be resolved during the next year. If Olympus releases the lenses it has promised to release during this period, the m43 system will handle every situation, with the probable exception of sports and birds-in-flight, at least as well as than the Canon or Nikon dSLRs. And it will do so with cameras and equipment that weigh less than half as much and take up less than half the space. No mean achievement.The only other potential drawback of the E-M1 is video. That's funny because the E-M1 has the best in-body-image-stabilization system (IBIS) on the market, and IBIS makes doing handheld video much easier. However, the E-M1 doesn't have high frame rates. Probably not an issue for consumer video but a drawback for more serious users. If you're a heavy video user you probably want to look at the Panasonic GX7. Same m43 system but Panasonic has concentrated more on video and Olympus has focused more on still photography. No doubt they'll both become equally adept at each but right now that's not the case.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best camera trade I've ever made", "Author": "Robert C.

Max bitrate of 24 is pre-historic compared to GH3. I am not asking for 4k. At least 48-72 would make me use this for making short movies. Not sure if a firmware update can accomplish that. Would be a fabulous addition if they can do that. Fuji is known for firmware updates to meet customer expectations.

I have the OM-D E-M5, and the E-M1 surpasses it in so many ways. Because of the light weight and small size the E-M5 will accompany me on my backpacking trips, that is why I got it, but the E-M1 - it will be my most favored tool. From the design and location of the knobs and buttons, to the wireless capability, to the depth of field preview button... I love this camera.A bit of a learning curve on the menu system at first, but so very similar to the E-M5 that I am pretty comfortable with quickly navigating many functions while using the E-M1. The camera and grip from Olympus feel so nice in the hands... love the light weight and small size. Lots of attention to detail in design, fit and finish.The huge viewfinder is bright, crisp and clear... I use it more than the rear view panel, but when I need to, I frequently find the adjustments available to the rear view panel are so very useful.The picture quality is outstanding, I have two zooms and the 45 mm prime.Gripe... why though ask several hundred dollars more for the black colored 12 mm F 2.0 prime over the silver color? If I cannot get it in black for $700-something, I won't get it. I'm not going to pay $1200 to get it.What are you waiting for?

For many years I lugged around a pair of Canon DSLR's, one with a wide angle zoom and one with a telephoto zoom.  While the image quality was great my aging body got tired of carrying these large cameras and lenses.  Recently I've been looking to downsize my pack and lighten my load.After owning most Canon DSLR's from the 10D to the 5D MkII I added a Leica M9 to my pack.  This camera lightened my load considerably, but I gave up the flexibility of autofocus and zoom lenses.  On tours when I don't have much time to compose a shot having to change lenses was a problem.  While the image quality was superb the lack of flexibility was frustrating.  I've also carried the Lumix GH2 and Sony NEX-7 with telephoto zooms to compliment the Leica.  These are fine cameras, but the image quality was not up to that of my Canon DSLR's.In December I bought the E-M1 with the 12-40mm Pro lens.  I was quickly sold on the system.  The image quality was great, dynamic range was better than all but the latest Canon pro cameras, autofocus was fast and the build quality superb.  I also like the electronic viewfinder where I can see the histogram and adjust exposure before I shoot and view the shot immediately after it is taken in the viewfinder.  This sames lowering the camera from the eye to check exposure and composition.I liked the camera so much that I bought a second body and a Lumix 35-100mm f2.8 lens.  Carrying the two cameras is no problem and I have immediate availability for shots from 24mm - 200mm 35mm equivalent at f2.8 in a compact set.  I'm adding the Olympus 9-18mm lens for wide angle shots and the 45mm f1.8 for portraits.  This last lens despite its f1.8 aperture weighs only about 1/4 lb. and easily fits in my pocket.  You can't do that what a DSLR camera.I have just finished selling all my Canon and Leica gear on eBay and couldn't be happier.

The E-M1 is no exception............................................The Good--This camera looks great, feels solid, all dials are smooth, good ergonomics.--Button layout (physical location) is generally convenient and fairly intuitive.--Two dials is nice to have.--The ability to do so much customization is great in theory--once you've set up the buttons, you can avoid the use of menus for the most part.  Great for quick changes in the field.  The bad news is that the setup is not always logical and the explanations aren't always sufficient.  I've never owned a camera that made it this hard to set simple things like a quick change between RAW and JPEG.  It would have been nicer to have one or two sensible dedicated buttons or levers such as the AF/CAF/MF found on other cameras.  There is such a thing as too much choice (a fact well known to marketers).--Default colors are good in easy shooting situations.  I have yet to test the extremes (for example, many good cameras can't handle the color range found in brilliant sunsets, and tend to convert many other colors to oranges and yellows).--The zoom capability is fantastic for long-range shooting.  At 300mm you are getting 600mm FF equivalent, and with plenty of resolution.  I've shot a lot with a 300mm on an APSC camera and the difference between 450mm equiv and 600mm equiv is tremendous.  And the IQ holds up extremely well, with fine detail.  I have tested with both the 14-150mm and the 75-300mm MFT lenses.  Very nice.--This camera is lighter and smaller than most of its DSLR counterparts (but not other mirrorless cameras with larger sensors).  However, don't expect this kit to be feather-like.  You're not going to mistake this camera + lens for an FZ200 in your camera bag.  That said, every little bit counts.  Here are some actual figures; I've included a zoom lens with the E-M1 to make a realistic comparison with bridge camera weights (built-in zoom).Weight (body only):PEN E-P1 = 335g (no VF; accessory VF clips onto hot shoe)NEX6 = 346gG5 = 396gCanon Rebel L = 407gSony a7r = 465gE-M1 = 497g; 14-150mm lens = 280g; Total = 780g approx.Nikon D3200 = 500gFZ150 = 537g (built-in 25-600mm equiv. zoom lens)Canon 300D = 560gPentax K-r = 595gPentax K-5 = 740gRX10 = 813g (built-in 24-200mm equiv. zoom lens)Likewise the lenses; for all the excitement about lightweight lenses, they aren't significantly lighter than any other lens for a camera that has IS in the body and not in the lens.Lens weight of 2 lenses I own and use:E-M1 75-300mm = 423gPentax 55-300mm = 425gAnd I have to point out that the Pentax lens is a lot more solid.......................................................The Questionable--Why base ISO of 200?  What am I losing by going to the lower setting?--What effect will the default \"warm color\" setting have in Auto WB in daylight?  I don't need more R; there's plenty of that where I live (as compared to, say, ocean shots in Hawai'i)..........................................................The Less than Ideal and Downright PoorThis camera can do such nice things, and has gotten so thoroughly hyped, and has so many enthusiastic fans (including those who have yet to see or touch it) that it feels sacrilegious to point out any flaws.  Emperor's New Clothes, and all that.  But somebody's got to do it.--The video isn't anywhere near what you would expect from a camera at this price point, and I sure wouldn't buy this camera for video purposes.  It doesn't have the quality of AVCHD video from an FZ150; the video from the E-M1 lacks resolution.  For example, the foam on breaking waves looks like white clumps instead of frothy bubbles as it does in the AVCHD video.  I didn't experience the serious focus issues, artifacts and camera noise reported by other users.  Actually I didn't experience any sound at all, because  right out of the box the audio function seems to be turned off.  I'll have to figure out how to get that working.[LATER: Got it.  Windows video player and GOM video player can't read the sound track.  However, I can hear the audio (nice and loud at max volume; almost blew my eardrums out) if I use QuickTime Player.]--Battery charger with cord seems a bit clumsy and not good for traveling.  I'll buy one with a folding plug built in; much easier for travel.--You can't use the shutter button as a focus and \"start video\" button when in \"movie\" mode.  The FZ150 (and probably other cameras) has this, and it's great; it coincides with ingrained shooting habits and muscle memory from shooting stills, it makes sense, it's intuitive, it's one less thing to retrain yourself in.  (The FZ150 also has a red video button, for those who want it.)  After seeing other comments about video, I suspect I'll be using my relatively cheap FZ150 for video most of the time instead of this camera.  The low res isn't an issue, and I've found that I can pull stills from the Panny video (either through screen shots or via Adobe Premiere Elements 12) that are plenty good enough for 8x10s.--Menu is awkward.  Finding a simple thing like RAW/JPEG isn't easy.--Changing WB \"All\" (to shift color balance) is a guessing game.  OK, I can see a green G (green?) and a red A (huh?), and what am I supposed to deduce from that?  And the controls are sliders, a blunt instrument.  What about a nice simple grid with RGB, and/or CMY clearly indicated for precision?  Other cameras have a nice, obvious grid with identifiable positions for tuning the WB.  This one is primitive and cryptic, and will require a lot of time-consuming trial and error.[LATER: I've been advised that the red A slider is indeed the R balance.  I get it!!  The letter A for red, I mean.  Remember \"The Scarlet Letter?\"  Someone at Olympus has a sense of humor.][EVEN LATER: Maybe the \"A\" for \"red\" is an oversight: \"red\" is \"akai\" in Japanese, so perhaps a prototype or model for the Japanese market was designed with \"A\" for \"akai\" and someone forgot to change it.  Or maybe not.]--The normal way to used the arrow keys on a camera is to navigate the info screen or menu.  But the E-M1 makes you push OK first; then you can use the \"arrows\" to navigate the screen.  But why add this extra step?  Just to be different?  Whatever the reason, it's one more thing between you and the results you're trying to get.  Meanwhile, that Ivory-billed Woodpecker that you were about to photograph has flown back into the forest.--Fully articulated screen, including the ability to fold into a protected position, would be much better than the very limited tilt screen of the E-M1.--When you're trying to set up various buttons and controls, the camera \"helps\" you with little popup windows that obscure your view of the menu choices.  Irritating and counterproductive.  (Turn them off with the \"Info\" button.)  At the other end of the helpfulness spectrum some of the settings (like the cryptic little icons indication AF points and exposure modes and the \"A\" and \"G\" of the WB) are incomprehensible unless you've got the manual in front of you, or memorized them from the manual beforehand.  And maybe even then.--Shutter release is too soft or sticky: if you're shooting at 10fps, no matter how lightly or nimbly you touch the shutter release, you're going to get more than one frame.  Every other camera I've ever owned would allow one shot regardless of the burst mode.--Obviously, every image needs a good camera and good glass.  Using the 75-300mm, I got some of the best results I've ever gotten using one of my standard long-range shooting subjects.  (I do a series of test shots with every camera I buy, to test IQ and lenses).  At the same time, I found that in many of the (involuntary) 3-shot bursts at 10fps, I would have a crystal clear image followed or preceded by one that was beyond soft, almost blurry.  I don't think this can be blamed on the lens.  Conclusion: seems that the AF and/or IS is erratic.--Shooting with the 75-300mm lens I got some of the clearest and best-defined shots I've ever gotten, including very clean, high IQ shots at 300mm (full zoom).  But at shorter zoom (75mm, 150mm) the camera focused on closer objects and generated bokeh on farther objects, even though I had set AF to single point and carefully aimed at the furthest object (a tile roof).  Not sure what is going on here; I'll try the \"small\" single point AF and report back.--Shooting with the 14-150mm I got very clean, high IQ shots at all focal lengths.  But the same insistence on foreground focus at the expense of the farthest objects.  This didn't happen between 90-150mm. Not sure what is going on here; I'll try the \"small\" single point AF and report back.--Continuous AF was a disaster.  Right in the middle of a burst sequence, or when composing a shot, the AF would decide to hunt, turning everything into a foggy blur.  I will stick to single AF.[LATER: it has been pointed out that CAF doesn't activate when shooting 10fps.  Nevertheless, there are blurry shots in bursts (maybe the IS is the cause?).  And sometimes when setting the focus during composition the entire frame would go totally out of focus.]--As mentioned above, video lacks the sharpness of AVCHD video; the video from the E-M1 lacks resolution.  For example, the foam on breaking waves looks like white clumps instead of frothy bubbles as it does in the AVCHD video.  Also there are hicccups in AE (little dark/light twitches as if a cloud were passing over, which wasn't the case on a cloudless day) and also in AF.  The latter is very evident when editing with Adobe Premiere Elements: far too many frames are blurred in comparison to similar footage shot with a small-sensor AVCHD bridge camera.  As stated, I would not recommend this camera if video is a significant part of your shooting.  I will definitely be using the small-sensor (1/2.3in) FZ150 for my video project.  Better resolution, better focus, better AE.  Plus it shoots 60fps..........................................Bottom line so far--Great burst speed and depth; that's the main reason I bought it.--Zoom lenses with great reach and good IQ; that's another reason I bought it.--Weight is OK, but there are lighter cameras out there that do as much or more in many areas.--IQ is very good, but so are a lot of other cameras.  Compared to Pentax with kit lenses, Canon with kit lenses and some bridge cameras I've owned, I wouldn't pay this much based on the IQ alone.  And I certainly wouldn't pay this much for the MFT lenses I bought.  But I needed a set of features and capabilities including VF (some NEX and Oly cameras don't have one) and good burst speed and depth; this camera has them.  So I paid top dollar (for the camera and for the lenses) to get the entire package.BTW, here's what Camera Labs had to say about the vaunted IQ of the EM1, compared to the GX7 and the EM5: \"both the GX7 and EM1 are a year newer than the OMD EM5, and the EM1 of course also dispenses with its optical low pass filter. Like many I hoped to see crisper results from the EM1 compared to rivals and predecessors because of this, but I just can't see it here. Don't get me wrong, the quality isn't bad. On the contrary the quality is great, but it's just not really any different from what we've seen before.\"--Video is pretty poor--outdone by a $400 superzoom.At this point, do I like the camera enough to keep it?  Yes.  Do I get excited about some of the capabilities like the fast and long-duration burst shooting?  Yes.  In balance, is it better than any other camera I've ever owned?  Not really.  But it's better at some things that I need, so I can overlook some of the less stellar factors.However, at this price it really should be better at just about everything, and it's not.I'll report back when I've done more shooting.*********************************UPDATEI decided I needed a more balanced camera (good IQ and good video), so I returned the camera and lenses and ordered a GH3. Also ordered a 14-140mm for a walk-around lens and a 100-300mm for long-distance shooting. Both Panasonic for the in-lens I.S. For video I have my eye on the Panny power zoom 45-175mm, but we'll see about that one.  So far I'm finding the GH3 to have comparable IQ for stills, and far superior video, both in terms of quality and shooting options.  For hybrid photography, the GH3 wins.After a lot of research, I went with the GH3 because I'm getting more into hybrid photography and want solid video capability as well as good IQ in stills. Burst speed is only 6fps (which I find is minimal but acceptable for most action that I shoot) but the JPEG burst depth is somewhere around 100 frames (depending on the card used) and the RAW is about 18 (one test achieved 24 with a super-fast card) so I think I'm OK on that score.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great build, good image quality, amazing IBIS, but vibration artifacts", "Author": "J.

Great, great build but for some reason didn't feel quite right in my hands.  Too small for a bigger grip and grip too small to really feel perfect.  The main thing that led me to return it were the vibration artifacts in images taken with shutter speeds between 1/50-1/250s.  Thought I was crazy.  Worse with the 9-18mm, less with the 12-40mm.  So I thought I'd try out the E-M10 to see if the 3-axis IBIS made a difference.  I don't know that it does, but I don't notice the vibration artifacts with the E-M10 yet.  Maybe the resonance frequency is different for the E-M10 and I haven't found it yet, maybe the 2 fewer axes prevent the vertical movement of the sensor, maybe the different shutter.

What I can tell you is that this is one excellent piece of photographic engineering.  The camera has everything you could ever want and more. There are reams of reviews all over the internet singing the praises of the E-M1 and they are generally spot on. But let me cut to the chase for those considering this camera.  For me, I am completely sold on the merits of mirrorless cameras, and I have sold essentially all of my DSLR gear.I have been a devotee of the new releases from Fuji; the X100, the x100s, the X-Pro1 and the X-E2. These are amazing cameras with what now is becoming a stellar lens line up. They have and continue to meet my needs with one glaring exception, sports and action photography.  In purchasing the E-M1, with it being considered the fastest AF in the mirrorless world, I had hoped to fill the aforementioned gap.  Unfortunately the glass just isn't quite there yet for true action/sports photography.  The legacy 4/3 glass is outstanding but very expensive and not suitably matched enough to the E-M1 for my needs. They require an adapter and there is a falloff in the focus tracking.  The native MFT Lenses are so far, below grade with variable and slow apertures. If Olympus would release an MFT 70-200 (ff equivalent) f/2.8 or better lens, then we would have something to talk about.And finally, my last and final concern.  Olympus and Panasonic have staked their mirroless success on the micro 4/3 sensor.  While most will be satisfied with that sensor, I am not. The amazing build and technology of the Olympus E-M1 doesn't outweigh the beautiful results photographers are getting with APS-C sized sensors in the Fuji, NEX, Samsung, and other lines (and possibly Nikon and Canon too if they ever get their acts together). Contrary to what anyone tells you, there is a difference, otherwise why would would all of these manufacturers be continually pushing towards Full Frame. Sony is already there with the RX1/RX1r and A7/A7r and while these are first generations, it stands to reason, we are headed there. Full Frame or even APS-C sensors in similarly capable bodies are on the way, and when they get here, why would you want to shoot a MFT sensor?

I've been using the camera daily for a couple of weeks now and it has been working flawlessly - no problems.  I owned the E-M5 and loved the feel and quality of it, but the E-M1 quality is a several notches above it.  I can honestly say this is the highest quality camera I have ever owned (I've owned a Nikon F2, Olympus OM-1, Ricoh Singlex II, Contax AX, Nikon D300, Olympus E-M5 and Fuji X100 and X100S). The build quality is excellent, it is lightweight but has a real quality feel.  The ergonomics are excellent, I didn't think I would like the grip built into the camera but it sure is comfortable to hold and control. The button locations are perfect, I can adjust everything I need without having to go into the menu system.  The location of the on/off switch is not in a perfect location, but it really doesn't bother me.  The image stabilization is unbelievable! I have hand held shots with the 45mm lens for 1.5 seconds and they show no camera shake - of course I'm holding my breath and have my arms close into my body, but no more tripod for me, even when using the 60mm macro lens close up.  I use the focus peaking and magnified focus assist extensively because I have several old Russian and Zeiss lenses that I use and it works perfect - spot on!  The viewfinder is very nice clear and bright.  The shutter sound is the best I have ever heard, it says quality every time I press it.  If you can get the 12-40 f/2.8 lens, buy it!
