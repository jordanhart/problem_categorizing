Period.", "Author": "Mumblin' Berk \"Berk\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZRGBU6UETWKF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually have a great deal to say about this camera.  I've written pages and pages prepping for this little review.Instead, I'm going to wing it....First, know this...  I take these reviews seriously.If you look at my other reviews you'll see that I do NOT hand out 5-star reviews like candy.This camera just WALKS away with top credits, in my book.  I've handled / owned a lot of cameras.Ladies and gentleman, this is one high-quality piece of gear.Since you've probably already familiarized yourself with all the dry numbers, specs, etc, I thought it would be of more value to a perspective buyer to get more of a \"FEELING\" about this particular piece of hardware.  If you're taking the time to do all this research, you are probably one who knows how intimately one can \"bond\" with a piece of gear like this.  It becomes rather instinctive, like driving a car.Here's my guess...  If you're looking at this particular camera, then you are probably hunting HARD for a worthy alternative to an SLR.  You want something capable, that is going to give you SERIOUS control, SLR-like quality results, without having to drag along a big burly camera making you look like a tourist everywhere you go.So I'm guessing you've found the standard top-of-the-line point and shoot offerings:  Canon's G11, S90, and Panasonic's LX3 (or 5)ALL OF THEM, WONDERFUL cameras.My opinion:  Samsung TL500 / EX1 bests them all.  Broadly.  And that is saying a LOT.Fit and Finish:  absolutely top notch.Weight / handling:  terrific.aesthetics:  I'm very utilitarian, so this is usually something I ignore, but in this case, I find the TL500 to be just a GOOD looking machine.The only specific feature I really want to talk about is the articulated screen...I consider a SIDE-MOUNTED, fully articulating screen to be the MOST important feature in any digital camera, and the screenon this particular camera is hands-down the finest I've very seen on ANY camera.  Just superb.  If it had lips, I would kiss it.(if you've never used articulated screen before, you're in for a treat, let me tell ya...)PROS:  all of the above, and a whole lot more.CONS:  Only one that impacts my shooting thus far:  NO dedicated custom mode button.  I like (and make use of) \"custom\" modes.  I like to programm at least 2 modes as custom, generally I like to jump in and out of \"macro\" mode a lot; and I like to set a custom mode for high-shutter speed shooting if I want to catch some action real quick, which I generally seldom do.  I like tripod / monopod / long shutter / low ISO work, even in bright light.Easy enough to work around, of course.  It's just something I'm fond of, and make use of regularly.IMPORTANT REMINDER:  Nobody has yet managed to produce \"the perfect camera\" so you will find plenty of things to nit-pick about with ANY camera purchase.I hope this somewhat emotional over-view of the TL500 was of a bit more use than dancing around about the lens and image quality.Best of luck with your purchase decision.Whatever you chose, remember, the only camera that MATTERS is the one you have with you when you need it.-Berk", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "What are you expecting?", "Author": "Flying Saucer", "ReviewID": "R2XP30AICAV8I0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So i've had this camera for about a week now, i've taken about 500 photos with it. I'm still learning the ins and outs of it.My review echoes many of the above points.Those of you expecting a DSLR image quality compact, keep looking. You'll look for years.This is not a comparison to a DSLR, the samsung is a nice substitute as long as you keep in mind it does not and cannot take pics like a DSLR.As long as you keep in mind the limitations listed below, you'll be happy.I bought this camera as an alternative to carrying my dslr.If you want-decent shots at iso800 (3200 is not usable, 1600 maybe if you convert to black and white or artistic qualities of noise)-hot shoe (i'm playing with radio triggers and my speedlight)-nice screen-midrange zoom, largest aperture in class-nice build, great ergonomics...-nice two dial system, like a dslr-moderately portable point and shoot (won't fit in your jeans pocket-maybe a jacket or cargo pants)-you can turn off the electronic shutter sound, so essentially limiting the noise it makes to a \"click\"...for whatever purpose that may serve you...-non HD video-you can flip and protect the screen when you store the camera.this is an excellent choice....Some cons which i think are significant to consider, but are not deal-breakers for me....However, please understand that i shoot a DSLR in RAW/NEF-WB is not consistent from shot to shot...so this could be an issue if shooting .jpg-If you shoot RAW so you can adjust WB, RAW takes a long time to write (although i'm using a class4 and class 6 SD card)-typical P&S; lag time from shoot to capture (again i shoot a dslr)....not quite fast enough to catch my child like my DSLR-please don't think a 1.8 lens will have the same DOF on a P&S; as DSLR...the larger the sensor, the shallower the DOF. You just won't get the shallow depth of field or bokeh that you would get with a f1.8 or f2.8 lens on a DSLR, except for when doing macro or having a very minimal distance from subject photos....-To say that this 24-72mm f/1.8-2.4 is faster than a nikkor or canon 24-70 f/2.8 is only taking into account numbers and not the sensors of their respective cameras. Not an equal comparison.-You can easily hand hold this camera for low shutter speeds, but you're limited to low light photography by the amount of noise above 800.So far, what do i think this camera is great for?I think this camera is great for food shots! I think this camera would be great for static images like food or other product shots and architecture.Not that great for capturing a playing child, but then again, most P&S; are not.I'll addend my review as i spend more time and test it with off camera flash.Update-July 3 and 4.So this camera is pretty good for macro photography, provided you can get up close to your subject. The minimum focal distance is such that you have to be careful not to touch the subject with the lens...It works with my Cactus triggers a.k.a \"poverty wizards\" and Nikon speedlight.I use this case-I think it fits perfectly.http://www.amazon.com/Tenba-638-681-Large-Camera-Pouch/dp/B0029B01UM/ref=cm_cr_wr_imgUpdate Aug 2.So I've gotten a little more time with this camera. The low-light is pretty good. I especially like the wide angle.One negative is battery life. It stinks. Maybe at best you can get 200 shots or so...It takes a long time to charge with the included adapter as well.Update 08/07/10White balance...maybe i'm just used to raw and fixing WB in post (I think the D90 wasn't that great with WB) but I think the WB on the TL500 tends to be too cool sometimes....or at least those are the pictures i remember thinking the WB was off. So what i've done since i don't shoot raw with this camera as it takes a long time to write to the SD card (maybe i need a card faster than class 6), i set the bracket to WB and shoot. It automatically takes three shots with one click of the button. One warmer and one cooler. It only brackets in A,P,S modes though.Another thing is i think it tends to overexpose, so i set the EV to -0.3.I do like this camera a lot though. The lowlight ability really pleasantly surprises me and in the right setting ISO 1600 is usable.9/7/10.I played around with my cousin's panasonic LX3. Maybe I'm biased, but this camera feels like a tank compared to the LX3. Like the difference between a nikon d300 and nikon d40. I actually think that if i had the LX3 first, I'd like the layout and feel of the samsung more.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best P&S; camera I have ever used, but not for everyone", "Author": "Michael Kaufman", "ReviewID": "R364AKH9RHSDS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is far and away the best point and shoot I have ever used. It takes beautiful pictures and has a great collection of controls so you don't spend a lot of time in menus. It is even better then the Canon G11 in adjusting exposure compensation because you don't have to move your hands to change the setting. It also has the best LCD on any camera I have ever used, including a number of DSLRs.Anyone looking for an advanced pocketable camera would be wise to check this one out.Having said that, there are four things you should know about this camera before you decide to get it:1) Zoom range runs from 24mm-72mm.2) The video is only 480p.3) At this time (6/17/2010), the Mac software to support RAW file editing must be downloaded from Samsung's web site.4) The camera is quite small, but it is larger then a typical P&S.;For my needs, these were not serious deficiencies. While I would obviously have preferred a longer zoom, most of my shots tend to be at the wider end. And while I would also have liked to have had HD video, I hardly use the video functions anyhow. YMMV.Prior to owning this camera, my favorite small camera was the Panasonic LX3. The TL500 beats it in IQ, high ISO performance, controls and LCD.If you are looking for a always there camera with the best possible still pictures in the zoom range of 24-72, this camera is the one to have.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excelent build quality spoiled by some unforgiveable quirks.", "Author": "Todd Gilbert", "ReviewID": "R1WIDYJZAL2X83", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off - this thing is built like a friggen tank. It outclasses every other compact prosmuer camera like the Canon G12, Panasonic LX5, Leica D-Lux 5 and others WHEN it comes to build quality. As others have noted I will start with a list of cons.1. Unless you turn off all shooting information - you cannot see entirely what you are composing - the information views have a black dimmed bar at the bottom that makes it so you don't see the bottom tenth of your frame. Doesn't sound like a big deal - but not very fun in use.2. The flash hotshoe seems to be proprietary. It fits flashes without a problem - the form factor isn't whats different - but when I put any radio trigger I had on it - it simply wouldn't make it fire. Samsung seems to deactivate the hotshoe unless it recognizes the flash on the shoe to be Samsung.3. It sounds like I got a bad copy - but the lens on mine was SOFT. I mean quite soft - looking like its actually out of focus.Now after those unforgivable problems - on to what I do like about the camera.1. Build quality - this thing is unbelievable. It's the first compact/prosumer that makes my 8 year old Canon PowerShot Pro 1 feel inferior (though not by much).2. Amazing AMOLED screen. Contrary to popular belief - this thing is amazing in sunlight - knocks my G12 (what I kept) out of the park in this arena. High res with beautiful colors.3. Flush hotshoe. Wish it worked for my purposes - but I like that the hotshoe has been sunk in flush with the top of the camera.4. Lack of an optical viewfinder. That's right - I said the LACK - of an optical viewfinder. I hate the awful tunnelvision on the G12 - I wish they would have left it off and let me have the amazing screen.5. Very bight lens. f/1.8 on a compact - nuff said.6. This might seem childish - but it has VERY pretty menus - just makes it fun to use.Overall if my cons don't break your interest in the camera - go for it - if it was sharp and I wasn't into off-camera-flash so much this would be a fantastic camera.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "a GREAT alternative to the S90 & LX3 has the \"IT\" factor", "Author": "Radio Man \"yarns13\"", "ReviewID": "R3BVCZ8RDO0FUO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If I could, I would actually give this camera 4.5 stars. Why? I take a 1/2 star off because you can't use all features with all modes. Example, as noted maybe in other reviews, if you like face detection..and you like raw..Face detection is not available. If you like to add sharpness to your jpgs IN camera..again face detection is blocked out. Dual anti shake..I believe you can NOT choose iso. You CAN choose a million different settings with this manually, just some settings make others unavailable..something just to be honest here. Weird, I am telling you how great this camera is yet I am writing negative stuff. BUT!!! Here comes the GREAT.The OVERALL camera is fantastic!! The image quality especially outdoors is second to none vs the S90, FUJI EXR200, and LX3. I owned all three, still own the s90. I LOVE the color on the TL500 as it seems so accurate. The biggest reason I just bought the TL500 is EVERY picture I took with my Canon S90 people's skin color is toooo pink. I have read other reviews that point to that fact as well. I shoot mostly pictures with PEOPLE in them. I am not the type to shoot a beautiful landscape,Garden, or a Mountain, unless I am also taking the pic with my wife or family also IN that picture. The S90 though an amazing camera...NEVER has good skin tone outside,unless you like too much magenta (Pink/purple).I had to fix EVERY picture and that made me look elsewhere, hence I found this Samsung. Still having both cameras being honest..the S90 seems just a wee bit more sharp,but pics are over saturated and too smooth?(Canon) and the s90 seems to have just a wee bit less noise at 200,400,800 iso etc indoors. But it's quite close and the OVERALL picture IQ, dynamic range, ACCURATE color goes to this TL 500 over the s90.The Samsung just feels like you WANT to use it. I call it the IT factor not to sound like a nut. :)  What I mean is something about it just wants to make you pick it up and take pictures. I did not get that feeling at all about the Canon. To me, the S90 feels more like a nice well made toy. Of course that is just my opinion. More to fact, at least to my eyes, the Samsung takes FANTASTIC pictures, image stabilization is very good, the swivel screen is GREAT and so useful in bright sunlight. I used to own the LX3 and though a very nice camera..it too suffered from bizarre skin tones overall. There are forums that talk about how many could never get skin tone quite RIGHT on the lx3 even with raw. The TL500 so far in low to good light is producing excellent skin tone right out of the box, maybe my highest priority. One more CON, the tl500 does take a fairly long time to actually write the file to the sd card..especially if using raw. It's not crazy long..but if you want to shoot shot after shot rapid quick..the s90 is the better choice in that regard. When you pick up and use the TL500 it just FEELS and SOUNDS like quality! I really love this camera..so much so I will be selling my s90. I also recently bought the new Sony NEX-5 which I gave 5 stars too. The NEX-5 is in a different league than Every point and shoot because it has a full size dslr sensor. I wanted a medium sized camera..got it in the Nex..and a rather small one when even the Nex is too large, the TL500! As long as you are not expecting DSLR quality I think many will LOVE this Samsung. Also again, maybe just me, I like to be a bit DIFFERENT. The TL500 is never going to be a household name like the s90 I guess?) I enjoy owning \"a hidden gem\", that to me is out performing all it's similar competition.The TL500 is a bit larger than the S90. If micro size is MOST important to you, you may want the s90. I personally LIKE the tl500's size better than the s90 as I LIKE the way it feels in hand, feel more in control of the camera, AND it's STILL actually a smallish camera and easy to take with you everywhere!. So keep this a secret..but the TL500 is a GREAT little camera..You won't want to put it down.A case for the tl500:? If this helps any one I saw another review here recommended a small case. I bought it and it DOES fit like a glove..though it's a very tight fit! Nice quality case though.http://www.amazon.com/Tenba-638-681-Large-Camera-Pouch/dp/B0029B01UM/ref=cm_cr_wr_imgAlso Lowepro makes a dublin 30 case fits Perfectly but I feel was too cheapyUPDATE: I had been using the TENBA case as recommended above, but it was always a fight stretching the case over the TL500's lens. I finally got to a store where I tried several cases for smallest size but easy in/out and protection. Found a case called SUMDEX Mini camera case. It fits like a GLOVE..a little larger than the Dublin and Tenba but it's like it was made for the TL500..also you get extra room for an additional battery and or memory cards in a small front pouch.. If link does not get deleted..have a look it fits \"perfectly\" seems well made[...]", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "I returned it", "Author": "Cubro", "ReviewID": "R3HDHN8W4DQ32M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Returned itFirst a couple things about me. I'm a serious amateur photographer. I've owned at least 15 cameras in as many years. I've used digital cameras for 10 years and I shoot primarily with DSLRs for the last 5. I have always had a compact camera as an \"always with me\" [AWM] and have had many flavors of them over the years. I eagerly anticipated, bought, enjoyed and can highly endorse the Panasonic LX3 as a top choice in that category. It's been my AWM since it's release nearly two years ago. I've used the Canon S90 and it is a fine camera too. If pocketability is your highest priority then that's the one to buy.Recently I left my LX3 in a taxi. Gone. Damn shame. I'll miss it. Took many fine snaps with it. So I scoured the web, forums, etc. looking for choices for a replacement.Criteria in roughly prioritized order:1. Wide lens. I take a lot of city shots, landscapes, etc. I strongly prefer a 24mm equivalent but a 28mm might be ok.2. Fast lens. I really want an f2.0 or faster but 2.8 might be acceptable. I take pictures in all kinds of conditions but I love taking city pictures at night. Need a super fast lens. Also I really want that aperture not to collapse on the zoom. There are no shortage of cameras that are relatively wide and fast but once you zoom your aperture is suddenly f4.x or f5.x.3. RAW. Do I have to explain?4. Sharpness. I want a sharp lens, corner to corner. Can be tricky with wide lens. LX3 is in general very sharp but at wide loses a bit of sharpness.5. Sensor size. Bigger the better. Not a lot of choices in compacts but LX3 and a few others do have sensors a bit bigger than standard compacts. Also 10MP is about the sweet spot. I'm of the school that packing a lot more into the sensor really doesn't add much unless you're printing very,very large prints (and then should be using a DSLR anyway) and can impact noise and low light performance.6. Form factor. I strongly prefer small, sticking with the AWM factor, but getting all the way down to the size of the S90 is not critical.7. Noise. Want it relatively low but often kept my LX3 (not the best with noise) locked at ISO 200 or lower.8. Image stabilization. They all have them but absolutely essential for dealing with low ISO, night shots, etc.9. Zoom. Prefer 3x or higher. LX3 is 2.5. Not great but remember it's hard to build a lot of zoom in a small camera and still have a really sharp lens across the range. Also, as noted before, the aperture can drop off very quickly in some cameras on the zoom. Want to avoid as much as possible to keep the camera fast for night work.10. Reasonable manual controls. I typically shoot in Aperture mode but full manual is occasionally essential.11. Ergonomics. OK this is much more subjective... camera feel, build quality, controls layout, etc. I like the LX3 very much here but it isn't perfect.12. Willing to spend a few $$ to get a good camera but would prefer to keep it in the $500 rangeSo what did I find on the market these days:I now spent a lot of time looking at micro 4/3's cameras. Panasonic's GF1 gets raves. The Sony NEX series. But I do not want to deal with the larger camera size or swapping lenses. Boy I came close because of the quality of the lenses and the dramatically bigger real estate on those sensors makes a significant difference in image quality. But those cameras... it's just not realistic to carry them in your pocket and thus unlikely end up a true AWM camera. So again for the purposes of having a true AWM... pass.There are a host of new compacts with lots of fun features but there's always some sacrifice in lens width or speed.So surprisingly there were very few new cameras out there that I didn't already know about. It came down to the Canon S90, buying another LX3, the Canon G11 or this brand new Samsung TL500.The S90: meets most of the above criteria nicely. As noted earlier I've used it (but do not own it) and it's a fine camera. The best form factor for AWM criteria. Nothing comes close there. Concerns: I'm not a big fan of the adjustment ring around the lens barrel. Not the widest lens at 28mm which is good but I really like a 24mm equivalent. Also the aperture drops quickly with the zoom (down to f4.9). Concerning but not a nightmare.Buy another LX3: I really have liked this camera. It meets virtually every criteria above. Concerns: weak zoom (not critical) and noise really starts to come through at ISO 400. While not as truly a petite and pocketable package as the S90 it is certainly fine in a pocket. Some hate the external lens cover. Not ideal but no biggie for me.Canon G11: Wonderful ergonomics. Controls are right where you need them. Very deserving of accolades. Concerns: not quite as fast nor as wide as I would like and noticeably bigger (but still just edges into the AWM category. Still a heck of a camera for a serious snapper.And I discovered the newly released Samsung. After much consideration I bought it. I will not repeat most of what has been said already here but here are my results after a week of use:Positives:- Wow what a fast lens. Zounds! But as some out there have noted, with a small sensor, even lenses this fast don't alway do bokeh well. Wasn't impressed with bokeh on the TL500.- Plenty wide lens. Sharp corner to corner (probably a tad better than the LX3).- Good shots at ISO 400 (noise gaining ground at 800). Low light performance was very good but read on.- Very nice white balance results (again edging the LX3)- Overall build quality is very high. The thing is built like a tank.- Most of the other qualities noted on Amazon are spot on. This camera has a LOT to like.Mixed results or more minor annoyances:- I am very mixed about the hinged screen. To some that feature is a godsend and I don't quarrel their valuation of it's utility but for me, it took away more than it added. Yes there were times it was useful and the OLED screen is really bright and easy to read in sunlight. But more often I missed having the extra real estate on the back of the camera for controls, it does add to the size and weight of the camera and it's quite a bit more awkward to snap a shot with the screen swung open IMO.- The camera comes with no charger (can be ordered separately) and the charging cable (also used for data transfer) is yet another highly specialized variety (I work in Tech, I've seen them all) and is REALLY short. The camera must sit within about 2 feet of an outlet or you simply can't charge it. Minor in the grand scheme of things but just idiotic IMO.- The rolling dial on the front is a nice feature for adjusting exposure. But the ergonomics are awkward. I have large hands but I'm not sure it's a hand size issue. You either have to take your index finger off the shutter to use it and in the process loosen your grip or you use your middle finger and then I felt like I was doing gymnastics. So really nice control but poorly implemented.- Heavy for it's size. This is not a huge AWM camera but it is heavy.- Shutter lag was neither impressive nor terribly long. LX3 felt a little faster.- I care little about video on still cameras and as others have noted it's not why you'd buy this camera.Negatives:- On Screen Display: the live OSD when you're shooting masks the bottom edge of your live image unless you set the screen to show no information while you're shooting. The result is that you really can't frame a shot and know how your live histogram and other controls are doing at the same time. This is more than an annoyance, it's a serious design error. This more than any other issue interfered with my enjoyment of this camera and it's effective use for me.- Macro is poorly implemented and you cannot get closer than 5cm. Auto-focus hunts endlessly to find focus unless you pull the camera significantly away from your subject then what's the point of macro. LX3 smokes the TL500 here.- Time Between Shots using RAW is poor. I used a Class 6, 4GB SD card that performed very well in other cameras. Formatted it in this camera. The average TBS was about 2 seconds in RAW. Sometimes longer! The screen goes blank and you just stare at the camera waiting for it to come back to life. Disappointing. JPGs were quite a bit faster and TBS did not really interfere with camera use. LX3 and S90 much faster in RAW.Look I can understand why some folks love the TL500. For some the screen is the best thing since sliced bread. I don't argue the point. The lens is truly excellent. Probably the best on the market in this class. It's why I bought the camera. After shooting with it I would still say the same thing. Best on the market.But the OSD masking, the RAW TBS performance and, to a lesser degree, the poor macro and annoying cable bring what truly should be a 5 star camera down to a 3.5 for me.So here I was enjoying the camera but having some serious concerns. Up pops the news that the rumors are now reality and Panasonic is releasing the LX5 next month.Back went the Samsung. I've pre-ordered the LX5. Will write that one up after I've had a chance to use it.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a Compact, not a Point and Shoot", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R3JBFHIXYUG91S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have wanted a compact camera for some time now, for those times when carrying a DSLR and bag of lenses just isn't appropriate or necessary.  Like most photographers with a closet full of cameras, I needed another one like a hole in the head.  Still, you don't always need to be loaded for bear.  It does make you feel silly carrying $3k worth of gear to the amusement park to get snapshots of the kids- although the photographer in you just can't accept point and shoot quality with zero creative control over the shot.  Until now I have not found a compact camera that I thought was worthy enough to leave my DSLR at home.This camera is 90% of what I would consider a dream compact camera- and in the world of cameras you will almost never see a 90% anything.  Cameras are always a compromise.  I have a 4x5 view camera, several Medium Format cameras, DSLR gear, and now this.  Each has its purpose because each one is better at something and worse at others.  What would it take for this camera to be 100% of what I would consider the perfect compact?  An APS-C sensor, manual focus, and an optical finder.  After shooting with this camera, none of those are a show-stopper.  The optical finder isn't necessary.  The screen on this camera is incredible.  You actually can see details while you are composing.  Manual focus- not realistic unless the camera is a MILC, likewise the APS-C sensor.  This camera does in fact have manual focus, but manual focus is selected by menu, then controlled via the rotating wheel on the back.  Great for macro shots of flowers, but not so great if you are accustomed to twisting a lens to focus on moving objects or touching up auto focus.  So, the choice is a MILC for $1200 or else this camera.  I chose this camera and I am so happy about it I can't stop smiling.  I realize that the MILC would simply take me back to a bag full of gear and $3k to take snapshots.  Samsung TL500 = hands-down winner.The Samsung TL500 (or EX1, depending on your market) is the best compact camera I have ever used.  It is truly built like a tank.  It has a classic rangefinder feel, heft, and appearance.  It has nearly all of the creative control you expect in an SLR.  Better yet, the swivel display is both incredible in visual quality as well as unbelievably handy.Picture quality is better than I expected.  Images at ISO 800 are fantastic and equal to those on my 14MP APS-C DSLR.  I don't realistically plan to print anything from this camera larger than 8x10.  I have cameras much more well suited to big enlargements.The 1.8 - 2.4 lens is incredible.  It is sharp, sharp, sharp.  JPEG rendering yields realistic skin tones, although the JPEGs tend to give a smooth appearance.  (Your wife will love pictures of herself, and possibly that was part of the design of the JPEG rendering algorithm.)  The camera does offer RAW, so if you don't want the camera to process the image for you then you aren't stuck with anything you don't like.  I can see that JPEGs will be perfectly acceptable for my needs with this camera, and I have RAW if I ever feel the need.Shots handheld down to 1/10 second came out sharp due to the very fine stabilization in this camera.  At ISO 1600, 1/10 @ f/1.8, this camera can darn well almost see in the dark.The flash is a manual affair, which is exactly what I wanted.  I despise cameras that think for me and do counterproductive things when I least expect it.  The flash on this camera is a tool at your disposal, not an irritating shot-killer.Oh yeah.  It does video.  That's neat.  Not why I bought it.  The video is lackluster due the nature of the sensor, which is optimized for low-noise photography.  Compact video cameras are dirt cheap.  If you want HD video, get one of those.  With the money you saved by not buying a MILC, you can get a really nice video camera. Or three.This camera is a Compact in every sense of the word.  It is not, at all, a Point and Shoot.  This is a photographer's compact camera.Highly recommend.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera for the price!!", "Author": "B. F. Wynne", "ReviewID": "R1TO8J529SBOBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I mainly shoot with DSLR's (I own 5) and was hesitant to buy a p&s;, but I'm glad I bought this camera. The lens and ergonomics are awesome. My fast mid-range zoom is a 24-70 f2.8. This one is a f1.8 - 2.4. My 24-70 f2.8 lens cost me $1300, this whole camera with a faster f1.8-2.4 cost me only $400!!! Gotta love it!!! The controls are very intuitive. It feels like a DSLR in my hands with all the buttons easily accessible. I love the dual wheels for manual control!Also, the picture quality is better than any point-and-shoots that I've seen. The ISO noise quality is probably a stop and a half better than your average point and shoots and a half stop better than your new high end point and shoots like the S90 and G11. The colors are nice, not overly saturated. I did have to increase the overall sharpness setting. The default was a bit soft. Mega OIS works like a charm. My hand-held shots at 1/10 is decently sharp.With the high quality build, this might be the last point-and-shoot that I would buy for a while!", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautifully designed and well executed camera", "Author": "William J. Hawthorne", "ReviewID": "R452RH45LPFAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must have read all of the available reviews on this camera and its closest competitors before purchasing it. I wanted a serious camera to supplement my DSLR - something very portable that would produce high quality pictures similar to my DSLR. I had a specific preference for a 10 megapixel camera with a larger sensor than the typical compact. I did not want an ILC (didn't want to buy or carry yet more lenses - might as well just carry my DSLR). Nor was I looking for a miniscule sensor with a gazillion megapixels, such as are common to most of the compacts and minis!I appreciate the very usable zoom range on this camera and especially appreciate its speed (f1.8). Pictures in all sorts of conditions are very nice - extremely sharp. Macro works well, nice wide angle shots, decent tele range. I particularly wanted the low-light capability of the f 1.8 lens. Features such as exposure compensation and white balance are very effective and easy to select. I am not generally a fan of using high ISOs and rarely shoot at over 400 (generally using 80,100,or 200 for most shots). At those speeds, noise is never an issue. On factor that I really appreciate and takes this camera into the 'serious' range, is the ability to record images as JPEG, Raw, or Raw+JPEG. Also, processing speed is fairly quick - no noticeable lags in shooting (although I don't typically shoot in bursts).The on-camera flash is nicely designed and very adequate. However I also bought the SEF-15A external flash - very compact, fits the camera nicely and is properly proportioned to the size and design of the camera body - I haven't used it extensively yet but good so far.The Samsung TL-500 is built like a tank - metal body (not plastic!)- great ergonomics, handsome appearance. It has a solid, hefty, feel that I appreciate - I was not really looking for something tiny to fit in a shirt pocket (this is a little large and too heavy for that)- but it does fit nicely in a jacket pocket. I also like that fact that the screen turns to expose its metal back when not in use, thereby protecting the screen surface.The camera's controls are thoughtfully laid out, easily used, and intuitive - easily and quickly controlled. Very nice, well laid out menus. The articulated AMOLED screen is fantastic! The ability to rotate the screen really facilitates shooting at all kinds of angles and the screen is very bright (no problem in bright sun) with beautiful an accurate color rendition.The criticisms that I have are relatively minor - a camera of this quality and price should come with a battery charger! I am not a fan of charging the battery inside of the camera and the included cable (as one of the other reviewers pointed out) is very short (too short to be safe for the camera). Samsung should have offered a few decent fitted case options as well. Finding small to medium sized camera bags for the camera and accessories is not difficult. But to carry around, a fitted case would have been nice - I had a padded mesh bag from a portable hard drive that I use for my TL500 to protect it if I'm carrying it around in my jacket pocket - it fits snugly and offers some protection, without bulk.I have no real criticisms for the camera itself - it turned out to be exactly what I had hoped it would be.  An interesting experience came when registering the camera on-line on the Samsung site - it was easy to register the camera - but I couldn't register the external flash (the registration screen wouldn't take a serial number - (CS was no help whan I called them about the difficulty registering the flash)- oh well, just a minor annoyance.In summary, I gave this a 5 star rating without any hesitation. If I ever had the misfortune to loose it, I'd replace it with the same thing.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera, not SLR but almost...", "Author": "Eran Shpigelman", "ReviewID": "R294HC7MFHVTD6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me say about myself.I am an advanced amature photographer and I usually use my D90 with mostly primt or high quality lens.The problem is that for family vacations (now I got twins) carrying all of this equipment was almoust impossible. So I was looking for a pocket camera with SLR like photo quality.As others I was lookng into: Samsung TL-500, Canon S90/95 and Panasonic LX5.First what I like about hte TL-500:1) Built like a tank, can fit your cargo pants pocket easily.2) Lens is 1.8 !!!! but this is not new ....3) With proper lighting and in ISO 200 and under - image quality is SLR like, which is amazing !!4) I am an avid strobis, so I tested my cybersync with the TL-500 and I was shocked to see that I was able to sync at 1/1500 without loss of light - this camera can easily overpower the sun which is great for strobists. The bad part is that because of the way the flash mount is built - it won't fit radio poppers trigger system., I think it will also fit pocketwizards, but I didn't test them.5) Screen is pretty much increadible and can be rotated.6) The menue system is intuative and really easy to use.What I didn't like (samsung - I hope you read these reviews and listen to them):1) The RAW files are huge 21M !!. My 12MP nikon D90 RAW files are 9-10M... WHY IS THAT ????2) The camera doesn't come with a dedicated charger - the battery has to be charged in the camera - this sucks !!! In that price range I would expect a dedicated charger and not needed to spend extra $50 for that (or less if you buy non sumsung charger).3) The full manual is provided on PDFonly and not added to the camera.4) One of the main reasons for f1.8 lens is bokeh. Since the sensor is still not SLR size - bokeh is only availble on macro shots. This is disappointing.Now - last year I got the S90 and returned it. The S90 is the smallest serious compact camera in the market as of today (S95 is the same), the picture quality of the S90 was amazing but the lens wern't good as the TL-500 and no dedicated hot shoe - for me this was the deal killer.The LX5 - Never tried it but from what I read it sound like it is a bit better than the TL500. The problem is cost. I got the TL500 for $330 (Apr 2011) while the LX5 would cost $449 - that is more than $100 difference, which I think are not worth it.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent carry along camera to complement a DSLR", "Author": "Rayaz", "ReviewID": "RSINSD4TVBA2M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using point and shoots i switched to a DSLR a while back (Pentax k-x) and this enabled me to get some nice shots of my 2 year old son while he is playing, something which i struggled with the point and shoots specially indoors.  However for situations where i could not carry my DSLR, i used my trusty Panasonic ZS3.  However a common criticism of this camera is that its indoor photos are rather noisy (newer version said to be even worse, just like all competing travel super zooms), and i noticed this before and more so after my DSLR!  Was in the look out for good point and shoot since even the smaller sized 4/3 cameras such as the olympus ep, panasonic gf1 and the new sony nex are still rather large when you take the lens into consideration.The canon s90 i heard too much issues with the build quality and slippery grip, the g11 was very alluring but it was still a large camera that was more a DSLR in size than a P&S;, the LX3 was my choice but when i heard about the EX1 with an even better lens and having the vari-angle screen i decided i need to get this.First its not a pocket size camera like the S90, but its still a very small camera that can be taken in a purse or jacket.  True it does not have HD video, which is a bit sad considering the LX3 even though 2 years old has HD video, but seems this is due to the sensor used in the camera (most say its the same as the one used in the G11 and S90).  However its got one serious lens, and add the zoom which still keeps it a fast lens its the ideal camera, and having RAW support helps.So here are the GOODS, the BADS, and the WANTS.  Though i must say its a super carry along camera, with a lot of the hardware and physical side nearing perfection. The areas which are weak is mostly the software and usability, which can be fixed by firmware revisions, and one hopes Samsung will fix them to make this a fine-R camera.THE GOOD STUFF- The camera build quality is EXCELLENT, it feels solid and the buttons move with precision.- The lens is superb, helps get some nice shots at low ISO when any other point and shoot will be trying ISO 400 or more.  Amazing how much light it takes for a handheld camera, that even in pure darkness where your eyes are not able to see, this lens is able to perform.  Sometimes you wonder how much light the little lens is able to take.- The 24mm wide angle is really useful but do note that unlike the LX3, it's a cropped 16:9 format similar to the G11.  Having a 3X zoom is decent, though a 5X like the G11 would have been perfect. However when you consider that the aperture is 2.4 at telephoto something that the G11 or the S90 can't do, you know the compromise is worth it.- The AMOLED screen is superb and works well in bright light as well.- The vari-angle capability of the LCD Is very useful, and the fact that Samsung has been able to get this in camera much slimmer than the G11 is impressive. However the fact that the LCD only rotates clockwise is a bit irritating.- Photos at ISO 800 more than ideal for large print sizes, and you can even push to 1600 for smaller prints. However compared to my K-x even with the kit lens, there is noise. However compared to the K-x kit lens, the tiny lens does wonders under low light- A nice feature that is not available with rival pro-compacts (LX3, G11, S90) is the ability to use the zoom for videos.  The G11 and S90 only allow digital zoom, while the samsung gives optical.  While there is the usual noise that can intrude due to the autofocus and zoom mechanics, you can disable the audio recording if you want in video mode.- The white balance is very natural and the photos are sharp at most apertures.  A bit of post processing might be required to get it to its best.- The auto focus unit is very good, and focuses quickly even under low light conditions.- Image stabilization is good AFTER i upgraded the firmware, but it still lags behind Panasonic and canon on this front.  My ZS3 and ZS7 panasonic superzooms were definitely more consistent, and so is my old Canon S3IS.- Samsung seems keen to improve this camera, as unlike other vendors they have been rolling out newer firmware versions.  However being the first time they are making a serious compact of this type, this is a must, and i do hope they will continue to improve this camera as the market has got hotter with the arrival of the LX5, and if rumors are correct the G12 and S90 replacement this year.THE BAD STUFF and THINGS I HOPE SAMSUNG WILL FIX WITH FUTURE FIRMWARE- No external battery charger. Battery has to be charged using the USB cable connector to a phone charger like adapter.  With this price, would have been nice to have an external charger to have the second battery ready to switch.  To make matters worse Samsung does not sell an external charger, so i had to opt for a purchase from the \"e\" \"-bay\" site.  Since i am not sure how good these chargers are, i have only been charging the OEM spare battery I brought using this charger.- Flash is rather weak, seems the guide no is 7 with auto ISO.  Its mainly useful only at close range.  Thankfully with the awesome lens you can live without the flash for most shots! However i have found it useful you want to take moving targets, as it can help take the photos at a higher shutter speed to get a proper shot.  The flash is also useful in bright conditions to stop the background getting overexposed.- USB cable which also works as the power cable is very very short, maybe only designed for a laptop user, duh.  Since this cable also works as the charger, one wonders if Samsung forgot that most people will have the wall plug quite away from the top of the table.  Having an external charger would have sorted this issue somewhat, but even for sync of pics with the PC the cable is far far too short.  Disgraceful to cut costs on such with their premium compact.- The ergonomics can be improved, and the G11 like rotating button has the same problems.  Clicking the directional button is hard as its very small and you end up clicking the ISO, Flash, etc buttons.- This is something Samsung should replace in the next firmware.  Going Sony style with menus is a big big mistake.  Even Sony does it much better. A simple menu like the Panasonic quick menu can help improve the usability of the camera 200-fold. Samsung don't let the software geeks you have drive this,  talk to real users and change this. It's not going to be a radical effort (i know, I am in the software industry myself and its sad to see usability being sacrificed).- Image processing after taking a shot when the quality is set at fine quality is slow, which is not what you expect from a premium camera.  I am not talking of RAW, this is in JPEG mode.  Lowering the quality improves the write speeds, so its either the processing power of the internal unit or flawed software.  Samsung with a good history of creating processing chips, and not being able to match (one would expect them to better) competition on this front is shocking.- This is yet another software issue.  The programing is too aggressive that it tends to use too low a shutter speed in auto mode and aperture priority mode. Regularly under low light it will opt for 1 sec or 1/4 even when you change the ISO from 200, 1600!!! and this is not required!!! Considering that the image stabilization though good is only consistent around the 1/15 mark, this means blurred photos.  Something that needs to be resolved in the next firmware.- Lens cap is stiff and a bit of curse to use (like the LX3) and also make the camera clumsy- Not as small as the pictures tell you, thanks to the lens cap adding to the size- Full neck strap is cool looking but a shorter hand strap would also have been an useful option for most, this is ultimately a carry time camera not something that is slung over the neck! (Samsung what were you thinking, thats for the NX10!)- Manual mode not easy to use.  The first is how the actual manual processing works, which combines the rear directional button to select, and the zoom control to manual set the distance.  Let alone that the biggest lacking is that it does not have the feature where it zooms the area being focussed, so that you can focus properly.  This is something i have seen well implemented in canon.  Again hope samsung's great programmers can add this capability.UPDATE 12-Aug-2010Added more text to my initial review to give more context to help others interested or knowing the camera better.  I have posted more samples in my personal blog, but i think amazon removes any external links so will not bother including the link.I have seen other owners comment and I too have noticed is that fact that the fasted shutter speed of 1/1500 combined with the max aperture of 6.7-7.2 means photos in bright light conditions are overexposed.  Something at S90 users also complain.  G11 with its ND filter is able to go 1/4000 which makes it better outdoors.  However considering this is my carry along camera ,which gets used more indoors that's something i can live with, but would have been greater if samsung can provide a faster shutter speed to allow better outdoor photographs.The camera surprising does not have an auto rotate option for viewing images.  This i think is a must to make use of the wonderful screen when viewing your handiwork.A surprising omission for a camera is the fact that the EXIF is not storing the orientation data.  Which means if you take the shot at a different orientation you need to manually rotate or edit the picture, since this information is lacking.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung is HERE!", "Author": "davonroe \"geoson\"", "ReviewID": "R3TOIT2DSDR8JT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every camera maker has that one camera that announced to the world at long last that \"we're here, and we've come to play!\"  The TL500/EX-1, not the NX10, is Samsung's call out to the big boys.

This cameras has been a long time coming. The combination of an f1.8 lens and a usable ISO 800. Makes this an unbeatable combination right now. That is if your a tinkerer when it comes to taking the photos as oppose to post/photoshop manipulation. In other words if you like to shoot manual and are ok with getting it right when you shoot it in jpg. This is a wonderful camera.I just got back from a work/pleasure trip to Chicago and it performed beyond my expectations. This camera is one of very few P&S; cameras that can produce wonderful night shot. Sure you can shoot in RAW but the write times are slow and there is a lot of software work involved to get the pictures where you want them to be. Me I just want to compose the shot and get it right the first time. In regards to the competition the LX5's ISO 800 is significantly noisier out of the camera and the lens is a third of a stop slower on the wide end and almost a full stop slower on the telephoto end. To some this might not sound like much. For me thought i want all the head room I can get. If i could get more speed or better ISO performance I would. My favorite pic of the trip was of a dark alley at night with some ambient lighting. I simply could not he have gotten a usable print of this shot with any other P&S.;The S95 is certainly the compact low light P&S; king but again the lens is too slow especially at the telephoto end. The ISO performance is mildly better than the TL500. Not enough to make a difference in print quality at equal ISO values, but I will give credit where credit is due.The last thing nobody seems to mention is the fact that if you shoot in manual or shutter priority. going from a F1.8 to 2.4 is fantastic since its only 80% of a stop there is virtually no adjustment needed.

An example of the clarity, there is a bridge that I use in my experimental sessions; the railings on this bridge have designs that are fairly intricate (yet not too ornate). I am capable of seeing these railings and the intricate designs within them from pictures I take of it from quarter mile away. To me, that is fairly impressive. I don't have to worry about using flash as much as other cameras use and have to deal with a potential washout.The sensor is a well regarded sensor (used by a variety of brands) made by a very respectable company. I find it more than acceptable to stick with what works (with this camera) than to design from the ground up a sensor that may not be on equal terms with this sensor. If Samsung had anything to change with this camera, it would simply be the sensor and leave everything else (with the exception of some of the menu design, which btw is perfectly navigable) the same.The body is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion - a camera shouldn't have silly colors on it, fancy symbols, or crazy graphics. I wish more camera companies would make a black blocky body for their cameras and not sell it at a silly premium (Samsung's pricing for this camera is extremely pleasing).I said it again, I'll say it now: My memories are in good hands and if you had any doubt about what camera to pick, the Samsung TL500/EX1 is an excellent choice.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "The camera that turns night into day", "Author": "A.

You see an image on the screen, take the photo, and 9 times out of 10 the photo is exactly the same as the image you saw. Storefronts at night, restaurants, lights, perfect, no noise. When I shot film, I dreamed of a camera that could do this. It has a beautiful, top quality f1.8-2.4 Schneider of Kreuznach lens, image stabilisation and a large sensor, in a package that's even small enough to take with you in addition to a DSLR for when it gets dark. No, the zoom range isn't enormous, but superzooms don't tend to work in the dark because they have smaller aperture lenses which let in much less light. With this camera you will love the pictures which you do take, so don't expect it to do everything.Okay, a Canon crop DSLR like a Rebel with a 50mm f1.8 lens on it (for example) is great, but it's three times the price and size and has no image stabilisation or wide-angle or zoom. (A 50mm lens is equivalent to 80mm focal length on 35mm cameras, which is perfect for portraits but difficult to hold steady at slow shutter speeds).The Samsung TL500 (EX1 in the UK) has a lovely feel to it, but requires a bit of getting used to, in that the screen is big and so is the lens (which it needs to be to have such a great aperture), which means that you have to be a bit careful with handling so as not to get fingerprints on the lens when you take the lens cap on and off, and be reasonably gentle when you twist out the screen.I keep the screen folded in to protect it, have attached the neck strap and also have attached the lens cap thread to the neck strap on the right hand side. I put it on the left originally, but then it got in the way of the screen hinge and was an accident waiting to happen. So now when the lens cap goes on it says Samsung upside-down, but frankly I don't care very much. So, to get the camera ready, remove the lens cap with right hand, use left thumb and forefinger to twist out the screen, hit the power button and it's showtime. I usually hang it round my neck with the screen facing upwards and can walk about and glance down into it. No crouching or squinting and much less threatening when taking photos of people than having a camera to your eye.If you have the digital dexterity of a gorilla and want to photograph birds from 3 miles away, get something else.If like me, you've always wanted a camera that can take handheld night photos without having to worry about camera shake/noise/crummy image quality, you will be delighted.

The camera started producing a small area of red pixels above ISO 400 and also caught dust underneath the lens. Samsung had me send it in for warranty. 2 weeks later the camera returned from Digitech Samsungs warranty company and it appeared as if a 2 year old did the repair. The dust was still under the lens, the articulated screen was loose and obviously reassembled incorrectly even though there was no request to replace the LCD the case of the camera no longer lined up as if the internal frame was bent. I immediately contacted Samsung who put me in contact with their \"executive customer relations team\". After I explained my experience to Tracy she said they would exchange the camera for a new one and they would send me a UPS label by e-mail in 1-2 days. I waited for the label and nothing came, so on day 3 I made a return call. I was then told by Kevin that my exchange was approved, which I was never informed it was pending anything for approval and again that the label should be in my inbox in 1-2 days. 3 more days go by no label. I then call again to inquire what was happening and am told it was approved the 14th of July and the UPS label would be in my inbox in 4-7 days......what??? I then asked to speak to a supervisor \"Shawna\" . I explain, I am a landscape / adventurer photographer and I use this camera extensively while climbing to save much needed space. I also explain I this camera is part of my livelihood and as we are at 4 weeks now since I sent the camera in and on multiple instances now on Samsung's fault I have been left out to dry. I ask if there is a resolution to expedite the replacement camera and am told she needs to contact the exchange department to find out what can be done. I say ok but had Shawna agree to call me back by the end of her day to inform me of what is going on. No return call is received by the mentioned time. So once again I call back. Through all these conversations I have also had to every time explain the details of what has happened so far as the notes left by the staff have been inadequate for them to pick up where the previous agent left off. So after explaining everything once again to a new agent and asking to be returned to someone who has helped with me before I am now on hold for a supervisor.

And I've tried something like 6 different compacts at different times.For a relatively inexpensive \"premium\" camera, this really had a lot of surprises, some good and some bad.The good:- For a compact camera, image quality is first rate. The lower ISO settings(200 and below) are mind-blowingly good, as long as the scene isn't terribly contrasty.  In really excellent light, even ISO 800 seemed spectacular to me, keeping in mind this is a compact.  Yes my D90 is better. But while the D90 is nice, it's not really a pocketable camera.- The lens is nicely sharp on mine.  I really was surprised at how sharp the lens is on this camera.- The lens is fast at the wide end at f1.8 and even at the tele end where it tops out a f2.4.- Built-in, mechanical image stabilization.- The wide is nicely wide, a 24mm equivalent.- I liked the controls, although this is kind of personal.  Some people say they don't like them.- The build quality seems quite good.- It is relatively small- In use it feels quite responsive for a compact- Very discreet, with the almost inaudible click of the leaf shutter.After using the camera for a bit, real world style, and looking at the photographs, I have to edit this and remove my caveat about ISO 320 being the highest reliably good ISO setting.  In the real world, 400 looks, well ... real good.  NO, not D90 good, but I can only tell the difference when I'm comparing.  On it's own, the TL500 does an impressive job up to 400. 800(!) is good in good enough light.The bad:- For being small, it's really not as small as I would have liked.  I sat it down next to my Olympus E-P1 with 14-42 kit lens(similar zoom range equivalent).  The tl500 is only about a half-inch thinner, a little bit narrower and imperceptibly shorter.  Of course, it IS somewhat smaller and lighter, and has a much faster lens.- In poor light, I don't like the OOC jpegs above 400. I haven't tried to shoot raw files and process them yet, but I intend to, since I've seen some forum posts saying that 800 is still good in low light when processing from raw files.- I wish there was some way to thread on a UV filter to the lens front, so that I could leave the lens cap off if I felt like it.Not good or bad:- Some people really like the tilt-swivel rear screen, but so far I haven't really benefited from this feature yet.  Still, I suppose it's better to have it and not need it, rather than need it and not have it.- I haven't tried any of the scene modes, kind of like the rear screen, I can't decide that these will benefit me, but better to have it, etc.- No HD video. For me this doesn't matter, but if you wanted HD video, it would matter.Frankly if it weren't for the fast sharp zoom lens on the tl500, the Micro Four-Thirds cameras and the NEX, etc. could probably eliminate the niche for cameras like this.  My Pen E-P1 is reliably better for jpegs at high ISO settings like 800 and 1600 and is only a little larger and heavier with the kit zoom.  Unfortunately if you use the kit zoom, which is fairly slow, you will often be shooting at 800 and 1600, when you could be shooting at 100, 200 or 400 with the tl500, so that kind of levels the playing field, which along with the slightly smaller size makes this worth keeping.  If you're in the market for a good travel compact, this one would be on the top of my list, although  some people might want more zoomer on the telephoto end of the range.  Personally I wouldn't trade the fast wide lens for more telephoto, and I wouldn't feel underequipped if I only took this camera when I needed to travel super light.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Favorite pocket camera", "Author": "C.

On these grounds, the EX1/TL500 does not disappoint.Images are relatively sharp and clear, with minimal defects and noise below ISO 800.  Color reproduction looks good, but I haven't given it a solid run-through yet.  Video is only 480p, but I knew that when I bought it.Initially, Samsung released the EX1/TL500 without Mac support for its raw file format (SRW).  The latest version of Samsung Raw Converter (3.2) is available on the Samsung website and works on both Mac and PC.  I'm disappointed that Samsung didn't choose an open file format (e.g. DNG), but all of the major camera manufacturers do use proprietary raw formats.  As of 26 Jun 10, neither Apple nor Adobe support this camera's raw file format.For the pixel-peepers out there, the EX1 is not equal to a DSLR.  At 100%, images aren't as sharp and details aren't as well-defined as in larger cameras.  That said, the EX1 produces images comparable to/better than the LX3 and G11.This camera has brilliant ergonomics, can easily fit into a pant cargo pocket, and can fit into the pockets of most mens' jeans.  The AMOLED screen can be flipped around for protection during transport.  These features make the EX1 an ideal pocket camera for serious photographers.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "I already review this camera", "Author": "Imanol Ugarte", "ReviewID": "R32CLDOAIR7OSX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read an article on the New York Times talking about 3 cameras: Samsung TL 500, Canon S 95 and Panasonic LX 5.

I expected much better images quality of NX10 comparing to TL500, but I did not find any substantial difference in images quality. Very close to each other.

Not too big, not too small. Manual controls, swiveling view screen, raw and jpeg, wide angle lens, build, etc. It was either the TL500 or the Canon G11. I chose the TL500 for its wide angle lens and the build.INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:  didn't like the short USB cable/adapter, but everything else about the camera is good to v. good.The color and sharpness of the photos I took was v. good.; quite comparable to my Rebel Xsi. Shots at ISO400-800 were quite good and the increased noise exhibited a very uniform graininess that was still v. appealing. Some of the menus are kind of clunky, but that is explained v. well in other reviews so let me come to the point: the wide angle lens distortion on the camera I received was intolerable.I own some wide angle lenses and I have an old Canon G2 with an f2.0 lens, so I have seen distortion before.Wide open at f2 - f2.8 you expect this, but I took pics at f4 and above that still showed massive distortion - even in close ups. Vertical objects lean towards the middle of the frame. Architectural  shots in particular suffer terribly. While this is a nice effect in some instances, it certainly is something that I don't want to have to continually correct via software. I am planning several overseas trips and I want to take some nice shots of temples, bridges, etc. and I don't want the pics to have this problem.Supposedly JPEG images are supposed to be corrected in-camera for the distortion but that was not true for my camera.

Note: if you do a lot of people shots at events and parties, etc. think about how often you can take pictures one-handed.  With lenscap this is always a two-handed affair.EV-1 and spot meter & AE Lock button (very well-placed so I use it a lot, right away) used in P mode.Still have to run some low-light tests with the little Fuji which still reigns as best low-light - if you're willing to give up all kinds of other things like image stabilization.Update 9/18/2010:The original title of this was \"haven't gotten rid of my Fuji F31FD\"; since I haven't touched that camera since I got the Samsung I've taken that away.  After three months of use I realize that they are very different cameras.My workflow with my DSLR is to always shoot in raw mode, take lots of images, upload them into Adobe Lightroom, pick the few that I'm happy with, \"develop\" those (adjusting the settings that would have been used for .jpg for each image) and rarely will pull one into Photoshop to make changes that require multiple layers.Now that Adobe ACR and Lightroom support the Samsung raw format I use exactly the same workflow with this camera.  I only shoot in raw without accompanying jpegs (which reduces the time to write in the camera).  If the lighting is challenging at all I will shoot in manual exposure mode.  Even using the spot meter on both, for some reason the Fuji was easier to use in full auto to get exposures I liked.  Maybe it's the wide lens but I have been less successful at using the point/AEL/reframe method with the Samsung.  Working in manual mode and having both the over/underexposure indicator and the histogram and the easy to use dials to adjust shutter speed/aperture gives me lots of control and is easy.  I manually set the ISO keeping it as low as possible.  Another reason to avoid Program mode with Auto ISO in anything but bright light is the too-slow shutter speeds that the camera will select.  I wish there was a way to set a \"don't go below this speed\" # like DSLRs and other cameras have.  Failing that, a faster default would be good.Because of the AEL button I leave the focus on \"multi\"; it does a good job of focusing on the foreground objects.So I wouldn't recommend this camera to be used as a P&S; I think there are other cameras that provide better output used that way.  If you're willing to take a little time to learn and enjoy using a camera the way they've been used for decades before total automation became the norm _but_ get immediate feedback to see if you're getting it right then this camera can give you excellent shots under lighting conditions that no other camera of its size can deal with.  And at ISO 80, even up to 200, the lens will give you tack-sharp, almost no-noise images.I am very very happy with this camera.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "samsung tl500", "Author": "mikem", "ReviewID": "R3HNVS223WV55I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received the camera.
