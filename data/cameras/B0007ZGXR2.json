Love it.", "Author": "FERNANDO CASSIA \"-Writer and Computer Geek-\"", "ReviewID": "RCUS6WUJ2R10N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera over a month ago. I'm like a kid with a new toy. But first things first, the advantages:1) It's a small as a cellular phone2) The LCD is bright, even when used outside in a sunny day3) A carrying pouch with velcro top -attached securely to your belt with no chance of it being removed/stolen since it's pass-through- makes it pass as just a cell phone. Nobody will look at you if you're carrying this camera around in your daily life.4) It's LIGHT and SMALL.5) Image quality is very good, at 2594x1944.6) VIDEO RECORDING is an acceptable 640x480 (480 vertical lines is about the same resolution as ntsc video = S-VHS quality!) is NOT LIMITED by anything, just by the size of the SD memory inserted. In other words, with a 512MB SD memory (around 37 bucks here in Amazon.com, look for the Kingston brand), you can record over 30 minutes of video at 30 frames per second. With a 1GB SD (around 66 bucks, Kingston brand), over an hour of video!.I challenge anyone to transfer back any MPEG4 videos @ 30 fps, 640x480 created with this camera to VHS video and make someone discover what kind of camera it was recorded on. The majority will think it was recorded with a camcorder or handycam!. It's that good. Google for \"The Inquirer UK\" and \"Samsung mpeg4\" to get the URL of my full review, which includes some sample videos and full-resolution images.The icing on the cake is the ability of this camera to function, at the flick of a switch (the lens retract and close as in the off position) as a DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER. So you can record classes at school, meetings, speeches, conferences.... records over 12 hours on a 512MB SD memory (8-bit, mono, wav format).If your printer supports it, it can even print photos directly from the camera to the USB printer just by plugging a USB cable between the two!.Did I mention that besides WinXP SP2 I also succesfully tested it on Linux (Java Desktop System R2 from Sun), and the manual claims full compatibility with Mac OS-X as well?.It uses the open-source \"XVID\" mpeg4 video compression algorithm, so cross-platform compatibility of the videos recorded with it is assured (unlike what happens with Quicktime, Windows Media, and other closed technologies).What else could I ask for?. Well, one thing, I can't wait to buy the keychain-style infrared remote for self-shots and group photos. It's an optional accesory like a TV set-top \"docking cradle\".", "Date": "September 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Packed full of goodies", "Author": "Trooper John \"Trooper John\"", "ReviewID": "R2QUJY4DLNKS1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Nikon snob for years. I owned my own photo studio for 10 years. I'm now a State Trooper who shoots lots of auto crash scenes. I own a small Nikon digital camera that is great but pricy. A friend has a lower end Samsung digital camera. We were out in the mountains shooting wild flowers this fall and after going home we downloaded the images to my computer. I found not only her Samsung photos were beautiful but my Nikon images were no better. Had to have one immediately!My Samsung Digimax U-CA5 lives up to everything they say it is. When I looked at the initial ratings on the page it didn't sound good but when reading the reviews, there didn't seem to be a problem with the camera. Trust me, this camera is great, from general snapshots to closeup and adding audio clips to the photos. The video clips look as good as some higher end video camera's on the TV and the sound, although mono is clear and precise. It's a $200.00+- camera that acts like a high end unit. I really like the in-camera video editing. The software that comes with it works flawlessly.Now my Nikon is only a backup camera........Enjoy, Trooper John", "Date": "November 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Lightweight and portable", "Author": "Carlos 'Catel' \"an IT veteran\"", "ReviewID": "R398O4293X7D74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally I don't have to carry a bag with the camera, I just carry it in my waist.

She has the red model and it fits nicely in her purse (or even pocket).  I think it's great that the batteries are rechargeable - you just plug it in like your cell phone.  The screen is bright and she has used some of the options- video and sound - but has not used most of other features.  The SD card is great too, since we have other equipment (flash, cameras) that use the same card.  We use our SD reader to copy pictures to the desktop and our printer software to organize/edit since we have other cameras also.  So far it has held up well, and she is pretty hard on her euqipment. We ordered from Adorama Camera - it also comes with a nice protective case.

The battery is pretty good.The menu is not user friendly. For someone who is unwilling to read a camera manual, or someone who isn't familiar with most cameras, the camera is a pain.  The interface is not intuative-- at ALL.  I say that as a \"techie.\"The camera has problems with shutter speed. There is a serious, problemic lag between photos. I have to hold the camera for at least several seconds for the image not to be blurred. It's ruined many photos for me. Even my 5+ year old digital camera doesn't blur photos and have such a horrible lag as this.Usually I like Samsung products, but I'm dissapointed with the performance of this item. I say that haven't used it nearly 1.5 years now. I wish I had purchased something else. Perhaps at the time of purchase, it was an \"ok\" camera, but now.. it's behind on so many levels. Even when it first came out, CNet gave it a rather bad review.If you find it cheap, and don't want to take action shots-- such as someone posing for you (hah!) for 10 seconds or longer, it could work for you. The shutter lag is a huge issue. I can't express this enough. The image quality-- when it actually doesn't blur the photos-- is okay. It's not stellar, not great, but decent. I plan on getting something else in the near future.", "Date": "March 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good camera for the price", "Author": "J.

M. Georges", "ReviewID": "R2ETCBMKCM8MPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera when it was priced at $99.99, so I don't believe there's a better value out there. While I was looking for one of those credit card-sized cameras, this one had such good reviews and was such a great deal I had to jump on it. I'm glad I did. The camera isn't big at all, much smaller than the old one. My old camera was a 4MP Samsung Digimax 430, and I loved it. I accidentally dropped it off a 40-foot tower. Surprisingly I could still take pictures with it, although the flash was broken and it took forever to start up and recycle for the next photo. I am currently serving in Iraq and I take photos all the time - I definitely needed to replace my camera and I did not want to pay $300 for a new one. At the same time I wanted something better than what I'd had before.I think everybody here has done a very good job of selling this camera, so I am not going to get into all the great things about it, just the things I've observed that aren't already in print. One of the things I looked into was the time it takes to start the camera up. I didn't read anything about that on this camera, so I knew I was taking a chance at it being as bad as my old one, the one major negative feature. Fortunately this camera starts quicker than my old one and it doesn't take too long to be able to take the next photo either (I can't wait to try to take pictures of the dolphin show at Sea World again when I get home).The one negative thing that was brought up in these reviews was the charging cable. One woman mentioned that the cable cannot be connected to the computer via USB for charging purposes; this is true. There is a charging cable that can be connected to either the camera or the docking station. To charge the battery in the camera, just plug it into the wall. The cable even has a built-in converter like on a laptop so it can be used on voltage from 100-240, meaning I don't need my huge converter that I sometimes have to use here in Iraq because our power is all on 220. I just need the European plug adapter, which of course I already have. So you can charge your camera if you're traveling to foreign countries easily enough. The USB cable for data transfer can also be connected to either the camera or the docking station, so I am not using the docking station at all.I have a 128MB SD card from my old camera. If you use the largest picture setting (2592x1944) at super fine, the card holds 52 photos. I use 2272x1704 and super fine, and that gives you 63. This size makes wonderful 8x10 prints. I never print anything larger than that.Well that's my 2 cents. I probably would not have purchased this camera had it been priced higher, but I think even at the $179 it's going for now it's a great deal. If that's in your price range, I'd say go for it... don't walk, RUN... I really don't believe you'll find anything better for the money, and I'd spent several days of online research, as well as comparing cameras/prices with everybody in my unit here, before deciding on this camera. Like I said, I'm very glad I took a chance on this one.", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "cheap and good movie recording too", "Author": "Sandip Kumar Devnath \"Sandip\"", "ReviewID": "R2QG4LO4HEO519", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "2 hr recording in 256 MB Flash with image stabalization.. looks good..i am going to try itget more details here[...]", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Amazon Cheats !!!", "Author": "S.
