It is a half frame camera, so don't plan to enlarge the photos too much or the grain will show, but is great for composing dyptichs, playing, and practicing composition.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful!", "Author": "Moriah Benton", "ReviewID": "REC40BCK8UG1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a lovely camera! It's good for a photography enthusiast who's up for experimenting with 35mm film or a young inexperienced photographer since it's not too pricey or hard to use, but it still produces gorgeous, interesting pictures. I'm already infatuated with mine. :)", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002PKJ734"}}
