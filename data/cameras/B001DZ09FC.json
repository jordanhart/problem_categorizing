{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad for price", "Author": "Peter M. Plass", "ReviewID": "RXNH8MN6KQI6I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You get what you pay forPro: Cheap, Varifocal, Dome,low amperage, Works well in low ligh ( not dark, But hotel hallway low light)Easy to mount, Not heavy at all so no crazy anchors where neededCon: Very thin plastic case, even with the varifocal 4-9mm, Did not pick up as wide of an angle as the 4-9mm it replaced. Was off about 1.5 feet on a 10 foot distance. Camera carriage or swivel, Not sure of its name is only 2 axis, So was limited on wall mounted placements. Dome comes off way to easy, simple twist, So don't mount within reach of people or kids.Other: overall, Happy, Worked great as indoor cameras on high ceiling in hotels, No real complaints and will use again", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001DZ09FC"}}
