They are all metal, have a pre-attached nice metal bracket and stay pretty cool compared to other hot running cameras I have owned.For a tiny pinhole lens camera, the video quality is pretty good. They are certainly not high def cameras, but they do good for what they are.  They even work pretty well in semi-low light (but since they are not night vision cameras, there HAS to be some ambient light to see an image. In very low light or no light conditions you will see nothing).The housing is very small, and the camera PCB can be removed from the housing and rotated 90 degrees either way if needed (I had to do this with one of them, to mount it on the side of a window frame).  I also spray painted a couple of them white to blend in with the window frames they were mounted to (just make sure you cover the pinhole lens before spraying. I cut a toothpick in half and stuck the thick end into the hole to protect it from overspray, worked like a charm).Overall I'm very hapy with the little cameras. 5-stars", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Search for cheaper camera first!", "Author": "N.
