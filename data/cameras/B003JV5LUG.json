It was on sale, and my daughter had asked for a camera for her 7th birthday. Well, we have had the camera in operation about a month, if that, and it is TOTAL JUNK! Although I didn't pay much for it, I still wasted over $40 and now have to replace it!!On the first use, we noticed more pictures than not were blurry...we hadn't gotten around to printing any of them off, but from what you can see on the tiny LCD screen, alot of pics had to be deleted. After the 2nd or 3rd use, the shutter would not close when the camera was turned off...I couldn't even manually try to shut it just to keep fingerprints, dust, etc. off of the lens. Then today, my daughter turned it on, and the LCD screen was like SNOW! You couldn't even make out the pictures at all.So....after writing this review, I will be throwing this month-old camera directly in the trash!!! And btw, I don't write many reviews and certainly have never, ever written one this negative...but I definitely felt compelled to let others know not to waste their money!!!!", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "One star is TOO MANY", "Author": "Jeff Thorsgaard", "ReviewID": "R15O8OTGLXR2D8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this camera to take photos of some signs I made.  The camera is absolute GARBAGE!  My 4 year old cell phone takes better pictures.

Vivitar just alienated me forever.  This camera is TRASH - JUNK - DO NOT BUY this awful camera - that is as clear as i can state my opinion without resorting to bad language.

BUT that is the reason I purchased it. I have been trying to replicate the old holga look in a digital camera. I think I've found my match. Actually this might even be a bit worse than the holga, but it has the digital lo-fi look I was searching for. Cheap, crappy and decent black and white. Anyway, if you aren't looking for the lo-fi look then skip this camera entirely because it is awful. Even when you use the flash nothing is sharp, in focus or good looking. Do yourself a favor, spend another hundred more and get a low end canon or nikon point and shoot.

It may be the single worst digital camera I have ever held in my hand. It was purchased for my daughter at Christmas and the pictures are blurry beyond belief. I went through numerous attempts to rectify the blurriness by systematically changing parameters to try and figure out what was causing the problems. After several wasted hours, it was clear that the camera is simply garbage. No manual comes with it and it is NOT intuitively obvious to work. For example, the camera ALWAYS defaults to the flash being off and I can't seem to make it default to an on or even auto flash. In the end, the thirty or so bucks you will spend on this camera to please a child is money thrown down the drain. I will never, EVER buy another Vivitar product again. I will also use my influence to discourage anyone else from making the Vivitar product mistake that I made.Friends, do yourself a favor.....when you are tempted to purchase an inexpensive ViviCam 7022, don't just walk away from it .....

She was so excited to have her own camera, after \"borrowing\" ours for so long.  Every review so far is right on - blurry pics, poor quality on non-blurry shots, terrible color recognition.  The flash defaults to \"off\" and no setting to fix it.  And now, the straw that broke my back... I went to take pics off the SD card and put them into my daughter's pic folder only to realize that the camera started the file count all over at pic001.jpg after the first time I downloaded them off the card.  Which most of you will recognize means that this time I had to either overwrite the existing, different photo (nope) or I had to rename each new file manually (yep).This is the first review I've ever done on a product.

I have has several of theses in the  past so I am not disappointed with the low quality photos.  In my work I ruin about 4-6 cameras each year.  Digital cameras usually do not like to be dipped in wet mud, so the cheaper they are the better.  For a 7 megapixel, the photo quality is abysmal; I have had 1 megapixel cameras take better photos.

Tritt", "ReviewID": "R3KYIHRI91C1GZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to keep in my car to have it handy in case I need to document anything. It appears perfect for this use. It uses regular AAA alkaline batteries that should hold their charge well over time, unlike rechargeable batteries that self discharge. The camera is mostly point and shoot with a fixed focus (1.5 m to infinity) lens (with an optional macro setting for close-ups). By default the camera is in 3 MP setting, but this can be changed to 7.1 and this change stays in effect until the batteries are changed. There are many other settings, but none of these really need to be adjusted.Users of higher end cameras shouldn't have problems figuring out the controls, even with the limited manual provided. The camera has three modes - still, video and playback. The set button is used to access a collection of settings menu. That is really all you need to know.The case is plastic. I'm sure it wont hold up to rough handling, but I don't plan to use it that much.One reviewer indicated the lens cover stopped working. This is odd in that the camera doesn't have a built in lens cover. Other comments indicated the users were too close to their subjects or didn't hold the camera still. Used correctly, mine takes excellent pictures.This is an inexpensive camera with somewhat limited features for a good price. I'd describe it as a good value.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vititar camera", "Author": "Raymond Harris", "ReviewID": "R2X7UOYY21RT69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "received camera, different color (silver)  but the camera works really well..I would probably buy another or a similar product.

I guess ... but how about THE PICTURES!The screen was full of little icons, suggesting there were things to set ... shutter speed ... ISO ... resolution?  But I couldnot find ANYTHING you could set.  OK ... it's cheap,maybe you could not set shutter speed ... but I could not figure out how to set the resolution.  The camera came with a CD ... maybe therewas a manual on it, but after messing with it for half an hour and not being able to figure it out I just put it back in the box andwe returned it the next day.  Of course it is risky to buy technology at Walmart cause there is no way to try it.  Fortunately Walmartlets you return things once you discover they are junk.Of course the lens is tiny, so I should have realized it wasn't a real camera.
