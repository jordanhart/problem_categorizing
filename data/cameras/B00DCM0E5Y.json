{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent - this camera should cost more.", "Author": "A. Shrestha", "ReviewID": "R1ARYUNBAM05ST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First Impressions:------------------The Fuji X-M1 is an excellent camera. As the cheapest Fuji interchangeable lens camera, I was looking at the X-M1 as an introduction into the Fuji X system. This Fuji APS-C X sensor receives a lot of hype, and this camera does not disappoint. The build quality seems good and feels durable. The overall size with the kit lens is also much smaller than I had initially thought from pictures.Out of camera JPEGS (with some slight tweaks) are very good. I'm glad that I don't have to spend as much time massaging RAW files in Lightroom.If you're considering the following cameras, I think the X-M1 is better than the following:* Olympus E-PM2, E-PL5.* Fuji X20* Sony NEX-F3, NEX-3N, NEX-6* Panasonic GF5The OM-D E-M5 has some unique features that may make it better for you (exceptionally good IBIS, weather sealing, EVF).Pros:=====+ EXCELLENT out of camera JPGs+ EXCELLENT control using dual dials+ Useful Q menu+ Easy to use regular menu+ Good build quality+ Fast focusing+ Good fill-flash+ Tiltable bounce flash+ Fast operation+ Customizable (I'll cover some tips later in the review)+ Tilt Screen that can still be seen in sunlight+ Small size+ Custom settings on the mode dialCons:=====- No EVF/OVF- WiFi apps don't allow control of the camera- WiFi is pretty poor on both Android and IPhone.- No sweep panorama- No built in level (c'mon Fuji - this camera BEGS for a horizontal level)Recommended Tips and tweaks:---------------------------* For faster AF, set the AF box size to the maximum and turn off the AF assist light.* I recommend setting Sharpening +1 in any film mode.* Fuji allows you to specify your tone curve. I prefer the flat look so I set Shadows -1, Highlights 0.* If you want punchy, contrasty images, set Shadows +2, Highlights +2.* For creamy noise free images to share on Facebook, set Noise Reduction to +2* Be careful with Auto-ISO and DR. Auto-ISO at 6400 is useable, but DR400 will introduce noise into shadows. I stick to ISO3200 with DR200, or ISO 6400 with DR100.* WiFi: Manual setup for PC Autosave is easier than \"Simple\" setup. I couldn't get \"Simple\" to work. \"Manual\" worked just fine.* WiFi: If you use the Android app, remember you must follow the instructions on the camera EXACTLY. The modes are not interchangeable. Otherwise, the camera won't be able to connect to your device. I think Fuji can fix this and make their app more 'robust'.Recommended settings:-------------------------* Portraits: Astia, Sharpening +1, Shadows -1, Highlights 0, Colors 0, Auto ISO 3200, DR200* Landscape: Velvia, Sharpening +1, Shadows 0, Highlights 0, Colors +1, ISO 400, DR200* Everyday: Provia, Sharpening +1, Shadows 0, Highlights 0, Colors 0, Auto ISO 3200, DR200* Dramatic B&W;: BW, Sharpening +1, Shadows +2, Highlights +2, EV Comp -2/3, Auto ISO 3200, DR200vs. Sony NEX (NEX-F3 and NEX-6)-------------------------------The Fuji X-M1 blows the NEX series away. Focusing on the Fuji is faster and far more accurate. The NEX-6 focuses faster than the NEX-F3, but both are still slow compared to the Fuji X-M1. Even more important, the NEX has a tendency to focus on the wrong thing. What I mean is, you can have people in the foreground (the subject) and the NEX will choose to focus on the trees in the background. I have no idea why. The NEX-6 has a very nice EVF which the X-M1 does not have. The NEX-F3 (and replacement NEX-3N) allow you to flip the screen 180 degrees for ''selfies''. The Fuji menu is significantly easier to navigate and the Q menu makes it quick to change settings, if you need to. [As a side note, the NEX menu is incredibly frustrating for advanced users. Options are under submenus, and you need to get back to the root level to change into submenus. Furthermore, if you customise your camera buttons in PASM, those customizations don't carry into some of the other modes, like auto mode. So when you switch modes, the experience of using the camera is frustratingly inconsistent. You'll find that the buttons you customized have reverted back to their default settings. I couldn't tolerate it.]The NEX does have very nice Auto, Intelligent Auto, and Superior Auto modes which make it easy for beginners. But for advanced users, I would recommend the X-M1 over the NEX.vs. Micro Four Thirds (u43)---------------------------I highly recommend the Fuji X-M1 over *most* of the u43 cameras. It's significantly better than than the E-PL5 and GF5. However, the newer Olympus u43 cameras (OM-D E-M5, E-PL5, E-PM2, and E-P5) have very fast autofocus. In outdoors bright light, the X-M1 is nearly as fast. In indoor low light, the Olympus is significantly faster. Keep in mind that the Fuji X-M1 is still faster than the NEX in both conditions. The X-M1 beats the u43 is in image quality. The GF5 shots were only useable up to ISO800, and I recommend shooting at ISO400 or lower. The E-PL5, I kept to ISO1600. The X-M1 can easily go to ISO6400 with better quality. Although the E-PL5 and GF5 have touch screens, I find that I don't miss it. I had too many accidental shots with the touch screen enabled on the E-PL5, so I usually turn the touch screen off. Note that Olympus has a fantastic touch to shoot feature that makes it great for stealthy street shooting if you tilt the LCD up. For people who really want a touch-to-shoot touchscreen, nothing can beat the Olympus.The Olympus cameras also tend to produce a very \"yellow\" image in indoor tungsten light. The Fuji colors are much more natural and realistic. In outdoor light, the Olympus is fine.However, if budget is important, keep in mind that you can buy an E-PM2 or E-PL5 with Olympus 45mm f.18 for the same price as the X-M1. The Olympus combo will allow you take wonderful street \"cinematic\" shots or portraits of your friends and family.If budget isn't a concern, I recommend the X-M1.vs. OM-D E-M5=============This deserves its own subsection because the OM-D is an excellent camera that can do things that many other camera's cant. First, the OM-D has the best IBIS of any manufacturer. The E-PL5 IBIS, Canon IS, Nikon VR, Sony IS, and Fuji IS can't compare. The OM-D 5-axis IBIS is so good, it allows you to do things that you simple can't do with another camera. You can take handheld \"macro\" (close focus on the kit lens) video. You can shoot sharp images at 1/2 second, and relatively sharp at 1 second. Seriously. It's THAT good. That's why I can't say with certainty that the X-M1 is decisively better than the OM-D. The OM-D AA filter is relatively week, and you can get very sharp shots. This is especially evident when used with a quality lens like the Olympus 45mm f1.8 or Panasonic 25mm f1.4. Furthermore, the OM-D can be easily customized (you can even directly control your curves!) and the kit lens 12-50mm has a built in function button that allows you to set it to do useful things like 2x zoom. So in one lens, you can have 12-100mm (with 35 film equivalent of 24mm - 200mm). That's impressive.Plus, the OM-D E-M5 has weather sealing. Although I don't use my cameras in inclement weather, it was nice knowing that the beach, dust, and rain didn't affect the OM-D.Although the X-M1 can produce better image quality than the OM-D, the OM-D has so many features, that it needs serious consideration. The IBIS is amazing and will allow you to do things that you simply can't do with other cameras.Between the OM-D and the X-M1, I don't know if the X-M1 is decisively a better camera. It's better in some ways and the OM-D is significantly better in other ways. I would recommend that anyone shopping for a u43 camera should consider the OM-D. Yes, it's much more expensive, but it'll give you so much flexibility and opportunity to do things that you normally wouldn't be able to do. Plus, the OM-D is built very well - it feels like small Tokina tank.vs. Fuji X20------------I wasn't impressed with the Fuji X20. I returned it. The small sensor didn't produce good enough results and I felt it was only good to ISO800. The focusing was equivalently fast between the X20 and X-M1, maybe slightly faster in the X-M1. For a few hundred dollars more, the X-M1 is clearly the better buy. For a pocketable camera, the Sony RX100 I/II is probably a better camera than the X20. (I never owned an RX100 though).I recommend the X-M1 or RX100 for slightly more money.vs. DSLRS---------------------Keep in mind that DSLRS can do things that the mirrorless cameras simply can't do (yet). Continuous focusing on a DSLR is much better than even the single shot focusing on the OM-D. If you want to take pictures of moving subjects, you need a DSLR. That being said, some entry level DSLRs (ie: Canon T3i, Nikon D3200) don't have as much direct control via dual dials as the X-M1. I'm not going to debate DSLR vs mirrorless cameras in this review - both have their advantages.The main benefit of the entry level DSLR is that they are more affordable; and paired with a cheap prime like a 50mm 1.8 or Nikon's 35mm 1.8, can teach you a lot about aperture and depth of field. You'll need to spend much more on Fuji's system to be able to do something similar. Overall, I think a DSLR offers a better introduction into photography.vs. D90========You'll need to get a D90 (or better, like the D7000 or D7100) to get dual dials. (Sorry, I don't know the equivalent Canon range). The JPGS from the X-M1 are better than the out of camera JPGs from the D90. I only use the D90 up to ISO1600 and even that requires extra work with DFine after Lightroom. The X-M1 can go to ISO6400 with better quality. The X-M1 requires fewer tweaks then the D90 in Lightroom.vs. D600========85mm on an FX camera is beautiful. The X-M1 can't replace something like a D600.Overall vs. the competition---------------------------If you're considering an NEX or u43 kit, keep in mind that neither those nor the X-M1 are pocketable. You'll likely carry those cameras in a bag. If you want something truly pocketable, you're probably better off looking at an RX100. So if you'll be using a bag anyways, I would recommend the X-M1 over the NEX or any of the smaller u43 cameras.I hope this review helps you decide on the X-M1. Enjoy the camera!- Avi", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera, with some downsides for those coming from DSLRs", "Author": "A. Gupta", "ReviewID": "R3D79WYWMGT5OS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Background and context:I currently own an old Canon DSLR - 1000D or similar - and had it for four plus years. So since last year I have been hunting for a replacement, one which lets me overcome the limitations of the current camera (more of that in a minute), leverages my investments in canon line-up (specifically: EF 17-40mm L, EF 50mm 1.8, EX 460 flash).I will go through my experiments/purchases, coming from a DSLR user, share how did I end up buying the X-M1 .. and what I think about itWhat was I looking for:1. Shooting in low light - my current camera maxed out at a sort-of unusable 1600 ISO. I bought a flash and learnt how to bounce it etc - but with new cameras and capabilities, the point of flash in casual settings became less and less frequent.2. I gained a decent bit of expertise on using manual controls - using AEV, aperture and shutter settings - and getting delicious bokeh. So advanced controls was another thing I wanted in my new camera.3. Video capabilities: I saw sample videos of DSLR cameras - and wanted to be able to take videos with the bokeh in the background, and do low light videography with high image quality4. More resolution: In-spite of what other people say about resolution - I like to blow up the image and look at it  - admire tiny details that might be missed in the overall shot when looked on the overall photo. Obviously this depends on the shot.. but my 10MP felt limiting5. Good image quality with JPEGs: I didn't know I felt I needed better quality at first other that low light - but didnt want to loose image quality. That said - I dont do RAW conversions - and I know I am probably not going to do it in the future either.6. Compactness: This came in as a later requirement - when I started noticing that I would use my phone more and more, and DSLR less and less - since it just was too bulky to take around people's places or trekking. That said - initially compactness was not on top of my list7. Compatibility with my Canon equipment: I have made a bit of investment from my perspective in Canon EF equipment from last several years - nice flash 460 EX II, EF 17-40mm F4.0 L, and my first prime - 50mm f1.8. Plus B+W MRC filters. So to me Canon was the company to go for8. Sturdiness: I have dropped my DSLR a few times on hard surface, gone to beach-side, been in light drizzles - and that thing keeps on clicking away. Want my next one to be similarly sturdy since I seem to be getting clumsier with age.What have I tried thus far:I waited for a few years for a good camera. I didnt want the EOS T4i / 60D since they used the old sensor - in general if sticking with Canon - why not go full-frame, right?So I got a EOS 6D with 24-105mm F4.0 L lens plus another full frame zoom. That thing took very nice shots - the smoothness of the image and tone of color was amazing. However, the camera system was immense, esp with three lenses to carry around, and that multiplied with the complexity - resulted in my not using the camera to even part of the potential.The next camera I eagerly waited for was 60d's replacement - hoping for something that is sturdy and takes amazing pictures. I got the 70d soon after it was released, and tried it a bit. The camera felt better than my current camera, though nowhere as good as 6D, and images were just plain ordinary. So - returned that.Why the XM1:I have followed a lot of photo sites in the last several years. Steve digicams, stevehuffphoto, dpreview, dxomarks, kenrockwell... they all have different perspectives and preferences. But the Fuji X system seemed to come across as a good one to look at. I couldnt find sensor or lens ratings at DXO for the fuji system - but dpreview had great sensor ratings for jpegs, and stevehuffphoto and other sites had a lot of reviews. Many of them talked about the compactness as much as the image quality. Focus speed was an issue mentioned in all of them - so it is something I had to come to terms with.The tough thing about the XM1 or XE1 was - there was no camera available to try out and see. Meant I had to buy it and try it out. After returning the 70d, I pretty much became open to trying out something new and compact. Along came XM1 with decent rating in dpreview, plastic body with a new cheap lens and reasonable price.Initial impressions of XM1:I have had it for several days now - here are my initial thoughts. Note that I will keep comparing it to Canon DSLRs time to time - though I will try to give stand-alone information on XM1 at the same time.Handling: This camera is small and tough to hold in one hand - esp if you are coming from DSLR. There is no grip, and the plastic is a bit slippery. Even compared to point and shoot - it is tough to hold because you have the big kit lens to balance. Holding with two hands is required.Viewfinder/screen: It obviously comes with the screen - and there is no viewfinder. That screen takes getting used to - the screen is a bit tight to manipulate and so far I have not found it as easy to move etc like say a camcorder or even the flippy screens on other cameras. The screen itself is nice and bright, and comes with good options for what kind of information would you like to see on itControl: I am a guy - so won't read a manual - right :). Kidding aside - controls is one place that this camera is still taking a little getting used to. E.g. on P mode - how do I adjust shutter and aperture; how do I change shutter speed in movies; where was the ISO again; how do I go back to viewing pictures if I zoomed out.. This may be a factor of me learning new things when moving from DSLR, but definitely not very intuitive to operate.OIS: The OIS works ok  but not great. I consider myself a steady hand - taking photos from my hand with my DSLR with kit lens OIS with exposures around 1/8 to 1/4 seconds (maybe even 1/2 if lucky). It is not possible with this camera. Not sure if this is an OIS issue or focus issue - the OIS does not work great with video either - there is more shake when making video in this camera than Canon 6D with EF24-105 F4.0L.Focus: Not easy to do perfectly - that's one thing I can say without sounding negative. Not having a viewfinder, and instead a small green box in the screen - takes some getting used to. The focusing itself takes time - maybe fraction of a second depending on light. It is not easy to just move quickly and take a snap - the subject has to be a little still to get a decent shot. Where to focus has also been challenging - I try to shoot a subject, but it ends up focusing on the wall painting behind. Learning to focus with this system is going to be important to getting usable shots - it is definitely way tougher to use for me than a DSLR.Wifi: The software etc is not very friendly. On the canon - using the wifi was easy - not so here. I just use the card now. Seriously Fuji - please do a firmware and software update to get this right.Compactness: It is tiny coming from DSLRs. Very easy to pack - though not pocketable with the zoom lens. Still - taking photos of people suddenly is not a scary thing for them. A compact holster for XM1 will be very handy - will search for it.Sturdiness: Not tried it so far. Doesn't feel very sturdy though - I am not sure if it will survive a fall onto hard surface. So I bought an accident protection plan.Image quality: You might be thinking - why has he given it 4 stars. This section is the reason. The image quality is worlds apart from my existing DSLR. Not surprising - since I am using a 4 year old camera with kit lens. But even then - it was a huge improvement from my original DSLR. Not just that, it is also better than the photos shot from the 70d (outdoor, indoor) which was double the price. The colors, tones, are just amazing. In fact, the quality was almost on par with the 6D with the kit L lens. Quality referred here is my own non technical judgement - blowing up the image and seeing each detail; looking at overall color of skin, sky, surroundings in the shot, seeing the clarity of the images at low light. Just the fact that I am comparing a ~700 dollar camera (the price I paid for the kit) with a $2500 kit and saying it is almost as good or better - should maybe explain what an awesome tool this is for capturing beautiful images. It definitely puts the other camera/kit lens combinations I tried in the same price point to shame.These results are with the cheap plastic kit lens - this sensor has phenomenal reviews with prime lenses - so at some point I will get one or two of them (or maybe XF Zoom) and use those.Overall - I am happy with this purchase, and while there may something to decide between this (XM1) and a camera three times its price (6D), for now I will happily use this camera.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera But Not A Great Camera", "Author": "PM", "ReviewID": "R1H7E8BBCLNDEP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using this camera for an entire day at my brothers wedding here is my review: (Note I used a Fujifilm XF 27mm F2.8 Compact Prime Lens the whole time.) (I am not a pro, most of my pictures are taken in automatic)Pros: Photo quality, tilt flash, great lenses available, very cool filters built in, Fn and Q buttons, start up speed.Cons: Occasional focus issues, grip does not feel very secure, repetitive menus,This camera feels really well built, it feels like you have something great in your hand.  The grip on this camera is not all that great, the camera just does not feel secure when you are holding it.  I would like to get the additional grip handle but I do not want to increase the size of this camera.  Speaking of size, even with my compact lens, don't expect to put this in any kind of pocket.  I wish this camera was a little smaller.  The battery on this camera lasted me most of the day, around 300 pictures.  I really like the flash on this camera, you can tilt the flash up or down, so you can get very cool effects.  The screen is good enough to use outdoors, and the tilt feature is great for taking overhead shots. The camera starts up quick and takes pictures very quickly as well.  The pictures, when the camera manages to focus, are beautiful!  I am absolutely in love with the picture quality.  Well worth having compared to the drawbacks.Update : October 5 --So I have been shooting with this camera for a few weeks now, mainly with the 27mm lens, and I realized a few things.Why I'm gonna keep it:1. I love the quality of pictures, they are insanely wonderful.2. Love some of the features - burst mode is good, Adv mode is super cool for shooting with selected colors, Q button and Fn buttons are great for switching and adjusting on the fly.3. Wireless (once you figure it out) is cool, at a party I took a few shots and was able to send the pictures to my buddy in only a few minutes.  He posted them on Facebook in no time.4. Looks I get complements on the style of the camera and I like the look and feel now.Why I can't wait for the XM2 or XE2:1. No view finder is a huge issue for me, especially since the cameras focus is terrible.  I tried all focus modes and they still miss the mark.  Manual mode with magnification tries really hard to correct the issue but the human eye is probably best for making sure a picture is sharp.  I missed some good shots and will continue to miss shots, I'm sure.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannot replace a DSLR (for me) but photos are great", "Author": "Lenny", "ReviewID": "R8VFNCBBGD9DV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since almost everyone has a camera these days (including phone cameras) I see two groups of users here - those who want something lighter than a DSLR, and those who want to upgrade from a P&S.;This is my first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, and I was really interested in how it performs compared to a DLSR. I've shot DSLRs for 8 years now, and while they have been wonderful to shoot, carrying around a 15 lb backpack everywhere I go is getting to be a pain.Unfortunately, this camera is exactly what it appears to be - better (but larger) than a P&S;, not quite as capable as (but significantly lighter than) a DSLR. I've brought it along on two vacations, and used it alongside with my DSLR (Canon 5D III). They are very different classes of cameras, so I won't compare things that are obviously different (like high ISO noise performance).Fuji has 3 different classes of mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras, this being the lowest end. What this lacks is an electronic view finder. It's been some years since I've used a camera with an EVF (Nikon Coolpix 5700) and I've heard that the technology has improved significantly. Perhaps a model with EVF would be more suitable for me, as it would address most of what I'm dissatisfied with this camera.First, what I like about this camera : it takes great pictures under the right situations. What are the right situations? When lighting is decent, when your subject is close by (due to the only lens I have - 16-50mm), when you and your subject is not moving quickly. Even for indoor with flash, with the included kit lens, it works very well. The color and sharpness is excellent. I shot in JPEG and compared the result with the JPEG output of my DSLR and it compares favorably - and in a number of photos gave me better results straight out of the camera (i.e. without adjusting in Photoshop). When shooting in low ISO, under adequate light, the result is very impressive. Even more so when you consider the difference between the lens included with this kit and the ones I'm using on my DSLR (24-105 f/4L and 70-200 f/2.8L II IS).Other features of this camera - the built in flash is decent and can be used as a bounce flash (though a hot shoe flash would be even better) and LCD can be tilted up / down (but not sideways).Now for what I don't like about this compared to a DSLR.1. Battery life. I took way more photos with my DSLR. Even then, I only needed to change batteries once in 23 days. With this camera, and moderate use, I had to change batteries every 2 to 3 days. The obvious culprit is the need to keep the sensor on and the LCD running. An EVF would solve part of the problem by not having to light up a 3\" LCD. Get an extra battery. You need it.2. Auto focus speed. Contrast based AF used in mirrorless cameras (and DSLRs in video / live view mode) is slower than phase detection in DSLRs. They are getting faster, but I notice that AF takes 2 - 3 times longer than with a DSLR,3. Ergonomics. Holding a DSLR with viewfinder to eye, elbows close to body, results in a much more steady posture. Looking through the LCD, I find that I have a tendency to sway slightly forward / backwards after focus is achieved and before I press the shutter release all the way. This will probably improve with practice.4. Need reading glasses. This is not something I had thought about before receiving the camera. With a DSLR, I have no issues viewing the scene I'm shooting through the viewfinder. With an LCD, to see things accurately, I need reading glasses. Anyone younger than 40 probably doesn't appreciate this, but those who are older will know what I mean. This makes it difficult to frame accurately.5. Usability under bright light. Under full sun, it is pretty much impossible to view the LCD properly (though it is much more usable than, say, my phone). Again, hard to frame properly.6. Grip - I have large hands. Not excessively large (I wear L or XL gloves) and it is rather hard to grip. Fuji has a grip that improves this, but it will block the battery compartment. You'll need to remove the grip to change batteries. And since you will need to change the battery fairly often, that's a deal breaker for me. It also costs about $80.There are other concerns I have about this, such as lack of choice of lenses (especially in the telephoto range), and minor annoyances such as the difficulty in attaching the lens hood - especially in reverse mounting it. The lens also zooms in a different direction from Canon (but same as Nikon).Overall, it is not a bad camera, produces excellent images, but it all comes down to alternatives.1. For a mirrorless, I would definitely prefer one with a good EVF.2. For AF speed, battery life, flexibility in lens choices, I'll stick with a DSLR. The death of the DSLR has been announced over and over, but I think it still has a few years yet.3. If an interchangeable lens is not of much interest to you, consider more compact cameras such as the significantly less expensive Canon S120, or the almost equivalently priced Sony RX100 II.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal sensor in a very good camera", "Author": "Shane O. Laake \"camera nerd\"", "ReviewID": "RWA092MVMVZJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got a Fuji X-E2 a bit ago and fell in love with the pictures it took, Fuji's design philosophy, and lenses.  After using it a while (and buying those lenses), I yearned for a 2nd body to double the number of lenses that were ready to go.  Upon reflection, I decided I didn't need a X-E2 (or X-E1), as I rarely used the EVF.  I tried the X-A1, but that camera lacked Fuji's X trans sensor (which X-M1 and X-E2 have), so I returned it.Coming from the X-A1, this was a breeze to learn (going from the X-E2 to the X-A1 took some getting used to), and I don't imagine those new to Fuji or photography will have any issues learning this camera.  It's oriented more towards novices than the X-E2 and X-Pro 1, but the results can be stellar for novices and pros alike.  Manual controls are buried a bit in favor of automated modes, but the automated modes offer better than average (which is pretty good anyway) results, so don't feel bad using these.  I opted to use the dials to manually control things, which all in all works quickly.  The image quality and results mirror my X-E2 (with similar lenses).  Speaking of lenses, the 16-50mm lens included is rather nice, and I like the focal length they chose.  It's neither as well built or as fast as the available fixed focal length lenses or the 18-55mm OS lens included in pricier Fuji kits, but both are better than what you typically get in Canon and Nikon kits.This makes a compelling choice for beginners, advanced users coming to the Fuji system, and users of other Fuji bodies looking to add an extra body.  It's not perfect, nor is it pocketable, nor will it match an SLR in continuous autofocus (it's getting close in single shot scenarios).  The image quality and the high ISO performance are amazing, as are the lenses.  Canon, Nikon, Pentax, and Sony all have made mirrorless systems, and none can match Fuji.  Sony has the bodies but not the lenses, and Canon and Nikon really haven't figured things out (I'm not sure what Pentax was going for, but I'm clearly not in that market).As a lifelong Canon/Nikon guy I can honestly say, go ahead and go for it and get this camera.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent package and images for the money but...", "Author": "suckerforcologne", "ReviewID": "R2SHUI5HM7PRDT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Many great things have been said about this camera and Fuji's X-trans array. No need for me to repeat the words said by many others. I agree with everything that has been said. The current price $600 was just right, so I went ahead and bought it from my local  Fuji dealer. But only 100 pics or so, I noticed 1 stuck pixel on the image sensor. The camera seems to take care of this pixel at ISO 800 and above, but the pixel is visible at all ISO's under 800. On many other cameras I own (NEX 5T, Canon T3 and Nikon D5200), Lightroom 5.3 will automatically remove stuck pixel while processing RAW files. So, I tried shooting RAW and processing it in LR 5.3 and Photoninja. But it did not automatically remove the stuck pixel, which is strange because the NEX 5T had one stuck pixel which was automatically corrected in RAW files in LR 5.3. It's also worth to mention here is, Fuji cameras do not seem to have pixel mapping function included in the camera firmware. The Sony maps pixels randomly every month. Which is how the stuck pixel on the image sensor of my NEX 5T was removed. Olympus also includes pixel remapping in camera menu.  I hope Fuji includes something like that on future firmware upgrades. You could send it to Fuji warranty repair for stuck pixel removal, but the thing about stuck pixels is that they can re appear anytime during the lifetime of a camera. I loved the X M1 and I would buy another in heartbeat if they include pixel mapping in camera.

The Fujifilm X-M1 is Fuji's 'enthusiast' mirrorless model leaving behind the rugged metal bodies and viewfinders of its big brothers in the Fuji mirrorless lineup. The X-M1 features a light but solid plastic body with a retro viewfinder-ish look. There's a nice high-resolution LCD (non-touch) screen which can be angled up or down and actual physical dials and buttons putting many settings literally at your fingertips. Unlike some of the Olympus and Sony models, there is no port to add an optional electronic viewfinder. Fuji uses optical image stabilized lenses rather than sensor stabilization found in some compact systems like Olympus micro-4/3. There's a handy customizable function button to help you avoid menu surfing and two (count 'em, TWO) setting dials for easily changing aperture or shutter speed or exposure compensation without needing to press extra buttons or use menus. The camera has a number of film-simulation settings which are quite nice including 'Velvia'.The first thing you should know is that this camera probably won't fit in your pocket (maybe a coat pocket). The kit lens is smallish compared to some DSLRs but not all that compact and the body is larger than the Sony NEX. I do appreciate Fuji having designed their kit lens with a wider angle view, however, than the typical 18-55mm kit lenses (extra points for that). Image quality of the kit lens seems pretty good overall. The body grip feels a little cramped but not really uncomfortable.The camera's built-in AF Assist lamp is helpful in lower light conditions and is much less intrusive than strobing the pop-up flash to assist auto-focus as with some cameras.The highlight of the Fujifilm X-M1 is the APS-C sized \"X-Trans\" sensor which is the same as the more expensive X-E1 and X-Pro 1 Fuji models (you just don't get the \"premium\" metal body or a viewfinder) and the same size as most (non-pro) DSLRs. I found the images quite sharp and vivid. The camera also produced very high quality jpegs and was particularly fond of the Velvia setting. Overall, I was very pleased with the results. Focusing is fairly fast but not the best of the mirrorless cameras.The camera seems aimed at the photo enthusiast in terms of features, controls and operation but still has the traditional auto modes (as well as a mode to automatically select the appropriate auto mode for you). So far, Fujifilm has released about a dozen lenses for its X system cameras with many prime lenses but, unfortunately, most of these are a bit pricey so this is definitely not a system for bargain hunters (not at this time, anyway). I feel the X-M1 would make a particularly nice travel camera with the addition of a compact prime lens or two.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "daniel", "ReviewID": "R3CLKWL1HDCXO1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this camera, has a big APS-C sensor.  i can take pictures in low light conditions without noise up to ISO 1600.

I enjoy this with the Fuji X20, and the Fuji X-M1 continues that tradition, looking nigh identical from the front (ignoring the large 16-50mm this package comes with!).The X-M1 is one of Fuji's mirrorless SLRs, and it offers a significant image quality upgrade over the X20, of course (as it should!).Here's the breakdown...The Good:1.) After a small learning period, the menus are very simple to use.2.) Picture quality is really excellent, even in the higher ISO modes. ISO 1600 is easily usable day-to-day, which is superb.3.) I was surprised to see that all 49 AF points are extremely sensitive. You can adjust the size of the focus area on each point, and the Fuji was excellent at focusing on each one (yes, I tested all 49. I am a nerd).4.) Camera start-up time is really excellent. By the time I hit the power switch and move my finger to the shutter-release, it's ready to shoot.5.) 5.6fps, while by no means blindingly fast, is competently fast.6.) Tiltable LCD is excellent. The hinging for the LCD is all metal, and even some pressing on the hinge resulted in no obvious flex, indicating this should hold up very well over the years.7.) The pop-up flash is enabled by pressing the flash button which releases a physical clasp on the flash. I was nervous that continued use might wear this clasp out, but after closer examination I discovered the clasp and part the clasp attaches to are both metal, and very solid-feeling. This took a flashlight to see, but I'm confident the mechanism will last.8.) Something the X20 lacks - the flash on the X-M1 is tilt-able. Bounce-flash is the way to go, and I'm so glad that even though it's a built-in flash, it's very useful indoors for bounce-flashing.9.) You can take a picture without a memory card in the camera. This is handy if you're just practicing and want to see your results. You can even zoom and pan and check out the photo in the camera after you've taken that (single) photo without a memory card.10.) Tracking Focus mode is excellent. I really enjoy this feature on the X20, and it's a great tool for focus/recompose without the small loss of focus that occurs without Tracking Focus enabled.11.) In manual focus mode, you can click the sub-command dial in to digitally zoom in quickly on your subject to check focus. This is an excellent shortcut button.The Bad:1.) Wifi transfer is there, but right now it feels more like BETA software than fully functional. Unlike the Sony RX100 MKII, Wifi is limited to transferring pictures, but not to being able to actually take pictures. I understand that having manually zoomed lenses on SLRs limits what you can do remotely, but you should at least be able to set the picture up focally, and then take the picture remotely. This is a shame! I also suffered numerous issues getting photos to my iPhone 5s. The software is flakey. It does \"eventually\" work, but I found it to be more of a nuisance than anything else.2.) The sub-command dial (that's the dial right above where your thumb is supposed to go) is constantly getting knocked by my thumb. This is especially frustrating since it's a multi-function button. In Aperture Priority mode, this changes my aperture without my noticing. In Shutter Priority mode, this changes my shutter speed. I have reasonably large hands, and I need to keep my thumb higher than the designated thumb rest because otherwise it feels like the camera is going to fall out of my hands. I imagine this issue would be less with a smaller lens than the 16-50mm that comes in the X-M1 lens/body package, but still, I found this to be more frustrating than I would like. I'm learning to adapt, but it's clear this setup won't be for everybody. The sub-command dial turns very easily, much more easily than the command-dial on the right edge of the camera (when looking through it). This, I'm sure, doesn't help with the accidental knocks of the dial.*EDIT*I handed my wife the XM-1, and she has the exact same problem with the sub-command dial. She has quite small hands. She physically cannot hold onto the camera without her thumb resting above the thumb rest and right on the sub-command dial, which again - can lead to unwanted toggling left and right.3.) JPEG processing: In the picture settings, noise reduction comes as standard set to \"0.\" This is NOT off, though. +2 is high, +1 is medium high, 0 is standard, -1 is medium low, and -2 is low. So out of the box it comes set to standard. I found a little too much \"smearing\" of the details with the camera out of the box, so depending on your level of expertise you'll want to use -2 or avoid this issue altogether and shoot RAW!Overall, in terms of actual picture quality, the Fuji XM-1 is an absolute winner. It produces lovely photographs, has more modes and features than you can imagine, has a tilt-able flash, excellent start-up/response times, and that wonderfully retro look coupled with modern-day build quality. Only some niggles with the ergonomics (and wifi software) leave me dropping a half star off the score, but either way this camera should be on your shortlist if you're in the market for a mirrorless SLR.4.5 stars out of 5.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great System for photos", "Author": "mousepotato", "ReviewID": "R2MB9GNMUQQC0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the smallest, most consumerized X-Trans sensor body and lens, but the results are... artistic.  I've just had it a few days and noticed:  shots usable to 6400, auto iso goes to 6400, minimum speed can be set, flash throttles down very well, the exposure compensation works like the old days, almost good aperature controls with the wheel, the 16-50 lens has fantastic focus/non focus gentle fade off (like an expensive lens),  chunky Leica feel, somewhat quiet shutter sound, too easy to delete photos, battery life dismal (due to longer sessions), the tripod mount messes up my easy sling strap, because I know I will need to get the battery or sd card out, etc.The truth is all that matters is 3 things: aperature, speed and iso.  You set the minimum shutter speed and auto iso and then the aperature is all it.  My 27mm is on the way, but the 16-50 is no slouch.  Yes, wide open is not sharp at the corners, but it is not as bad as you think and maybe that is the way it is.  At 16mm (24 equivalent) almost anything from 10 feet to infinity is already \"sharp.\"The fantastic sensor and the very artistic looking 16-50 shots, letting you take shots that only higher end lenses can take.  It has that 'look.'  I have a Nex 5n and almost all the Sony lenses.  The lenses are technically sharp, but as my famous photo friend says, \"your pictures are flat.\"  I took offense to that, but now I know what he means.  The simple Fuji 16-50 has that look: Supersharp in the center and edges if you want.  Even simple shots of the kids have that look.  It is the Fuji system, body and lens.  They didn't make a bunch of consumer lenses to start their system, but have a handful of primes and 3 great zooms.  These are not zooms of yesteryear, but modern zooms designed for their sensor.The focus is not ultrafast, but solid.  Multifocus can miss medium contrast subjects.  All the buttons can be mispressed by your thumb.  Night street  shooting seems to overexpose, but is easily massaged with the exposure comp dial.  Works quickly and effectively.  Colors are deep and rich, but not Kodak- has a cooler, more realistic look.  For some reason, converting to B&W; looks fantastic: wide aperature looks with solid contrast.  Reminds me what HCB said about color being distracting.  Build is not up to Nex 5n, 6, or 7 quality by far, but I don't worry because it feels solid.  Yesterday, I had the camera in a bag in my car and had to stop abruptly- the camera got a solid thumping.  Plastic is far more dent resistant than metal.  As a tool, I'm loving it and the pictures make me feel like create story telling.For those to young to remember Fujifilm: I used to have a Fuji enlarging lens which had some fungus, but it was way sharper than my Nikon enlarging lens. Cheap Superia film was even sharper than the Gold 100 stuff.  And you can still get prints on Crystal Archive paper!  Fuji was one of the first companies to put a great sensor in a compact body.  I have an old Fuji F30, which at iso100 has almost as good resolution as my original Canon Rebel at the time.  Of course some of those superzooms were clunk boxes.Update: Video is useless unless you shoot with manual focus- it hunts endlessly.  Still loving the photos I'm taking- they all have a 3D look, which is sometimes not apparent until you pixel peek.  That all tells me, it must be good for large prints.

Orchard \"I love lamp\"", "ReviewID": "R1JQBRDAPC31UM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first mirrorless camera. I've been shooting with a couple of Canon DSLRs (XS and then the T3i) for the past five years. I'm very comfortable with the Canon interface, but was excited to try something new. I've been hearing about mirrorless cameras for awhile now, but the X-M1 was the first one I've ever touched. I'm not a professional photographer, but rather an enthusiastic hobbyist. How you feel about this camera depends on where you're coming from; your vantage point of previous camera usage.I spent several days reading about the X-M1 before I received it. Since I've shot nothing but Canon DSLRs for years, I wanted to get a jump start on learning about the camera and interface before it arrived. I was excited to try out a smaller camera, to be honest. I love my Canon T3i, but the amount of lenses and stuff I carry around is sometimes burdensome.Luckily, I know most of the camera lingo and understand what all the settings are for. I've taken several classes over the years and well as been in an online photography group. So, I knew my only battle would be finding out where everything was on this camera. I currently shoot in M(anual) mode on my T3i and RAW, so that's where I started with the X-M1.The first thing that threw me was the lack of an optical viewfinder. When I went to my first DSLR from a P&S;, I *hated* using the optical viewfinder. But then, I came to like it. A lot. Luckily the screen on the back of the X-M1 is large enough. After all these years, I have to admit, the lack of an OVF (Optical ViewFinder) was something I missed. Not a deal-breaking by any means though.Holding the X-M1 wasn't as comfortable as my DSLR. It's obviously significantly smaller. To press the shutter button, your finger wraps over the metal bar that you thread the camera strap through and one of the dials. It feels awkward. The overall build quality seems good/solid, but a few things seems a little flimsy: the pop-up flash and the battery/SD card door. Both seemed like they could snap easily if you're not careful, esp the flash.The extendable display only extends and doesn't really rotate or flip out. I didn't find this feature to be particular useful, as the range of screen movement was limited.Turning on the camera and finding my way around wasn't too hard. If you're used to the 500 settings, buttons, dials, etc. on most DSLRs, you can poke your way around and figure out most of the settings. And there are a lot of them. After an hour or so of playing around, I thought it best to read the manual, as a few things weren't clear to me.Here are some of the things that tripped me up/took some getting used to:* The thing that tripped me up the most was probably the two wheels - the main command dial and the sub-command dial. They are right next to each other and I often mistook one for the other when trying to make adjustments.* The modes: SR+ (advanced SR Auto) vs. Auto vs. Adv. (Advanced). It was hard to remember which setting did what. Auto I know, but it seems the other two could have been combined as it's not immediately obvious what the difference between SR+ and Adv. was.* The 'Q' quick menu button for quick access vs. the Menu button. It seems these two buttons get you to most of the same things (like image quality, ISO, etc), so I often got confused in knowing whether to press Menu or Q to change my settings depending on what mode I was shooting in.* Sport, Landscape and Portrait get their own setting on the dial, yet \"Portrait Enhancer\" is also a setting under the SP dial setting. It seems like all these specific scenarios should have been grouped together under the SP dial mode.There were only a few things on this camera that were new/foreign to me:* Focus Peaking* Highlight tone and DR correction* Film Simulation. This was a neat feature, though I don't know that I'll use it often. It simulates the effects of different kinds of film.* Photobook Assist. I don't know why anyone would make a \"book\" of photos in camera. You can transfer them to your computer, but it seems like a lot of hassle. Why not just make a sub-folder on your computer?* Wi-FiAlthough some of these features are nice, since I tweak all my photos in Lightroom after the fact, the highlight tone and DR correction weren't of much use to me. I did like the some of the effects under the Adv. menu like Toy Camera, Dynamic, Multiple Exposure and Pop Color. Those were neat to play around with. It doesn't seem like you can shoot RAW in Adv mode, which makes sense, since it's \"processing\" the image for you.I did try out the wi-fi and transferred some images to my iPhone via the Fujifilm Camera App. It worked pretty well. Just select your camera under the wi-fi settings, fire up the app and you can transfer pictures to your iPhone or browse pics on your Fuji FROM your iPhone. Pretty neat. This is the first camera I've ever had that has had any wi-fi functionality. Fairly easy to use, too.The autofocus is indeed slower than on my DSLR and I found that annoying, but livable.Overall, the camera is great and produces images that are on-par with my DSLR. However, when using the Fuji, I often felt myself needing my external flash, and once you add that, you start to lose a lot of the appeal of owning a small(er) camera like this. Yes, it's a more portable camera (albeit slightly less so with the attached kit lens) and will suffice for someone who just wants to snap some quick shots of their vacation. That being said, if you're that kind of user (someone who shoots in Auto all the time), there's really no need for a $700 camera. A $150 point and shoot will suit you just fine. And, if you're someone who uses all the features of a DSLR plus accessories like light meters, external flashes, remote shutter controls, etc., you'll find it easier to just do what you know - use your DSLR.The thing I struggled with most is where a camera like this fits in. It's got more features than a point and shoot and is on-par with a DSLR. The smaller size is nice, but start added an external flash and zoom lenses and you're nearly right back where you started.As capable as this camera is, I found myself craving my DSLR every time I used the Fuji. Since I've been reading about mirrorless for a few months now, I'm struggling to see where these fit in the photographer's landscape. Make no mistake, this is an *excellent* camera, but if you already have a capable DSLR, I see no compelling reason to switch to the Fuji on a full-time basis. And, while all the options are a nice touch, I felt like there were TOO many options/buttons/menus/features - so many so that it got confusing and took away from the main reason I love shooting pictures - the simplicity of capturing a shot.

Cameras have a similar analogy: most people want to capture the moment before them; yet there are others who like to spend time setting it up for something beyond what they immediately see. That\u2019s the difference between Point and Shoot cameras and DSLRs. DSLRs are designed with features that allow the photographer to make adjustments to create an image far beyond what they see in front of them. Point and Shoot cameras are for those who want to capture the moment at hand so that it lives on forever: birthdays, sunsets, vacations, etc. Even professionals will take a point and shoot with them on vacation because they too want to relive that exact moment later on but not spend time setting up the shot.The Fujifilm X-M1 is a high-end point and shoot camera. It is loaded with a lot of features that make it really easy to get the correct exposure for the current situation. Even when you turn the dial to select the shooting mode you see right away how this cameras simplifies the shooting process: little help balloons pop up explaining what the feature does. You rarely need to use the manual for this camera. I always shoot in manual mode with my DSLR but I found the X-M1 to be extremely easy to use. The menus are easy to access with your thumb and simple to dial through. The X-M1 even has a quick menu for common settings. And while you can shoot in manual mode and create raw files for post editing the X-M1 has an excellent shooting mode that will handle most of your shots.Dial the camera to SR+ and it literally computes the scene and makes adjustments for the type of setting. When you look at the LCD panel you will see it automatically set the camera to portrait mode if it recognizes a face, landscape if that\u2019s what it sees, even Macro mode for close ups! It automatically adjusts shutter speed, aperture, ISO and other settings to get the best shot for not only the conditions but the subject as well. For instance, it does a really good job balancing the brightness for the sky and the land below. All you have to do is focus on the composition.But it far exceeds traditional point and shoot cameras with detachable lenses. This allows you to shoot true wide angle or zoom in to get really close. The camera itself is small and lightweight making it easy to pack and take with you just about anywhere. It is a really cool looking camera, too. Unfortunately I got a black one but the brown model is probably the best looking digital camera I\u2019ve seen.But it\u2019s not perfect.The strap is a bit stiff; for me it just got in the way of this little camera. The memory card goes into the same compartment as the battery and isn\u2019t all that easy to get out; which I do to copy the photos to my computer because the WIFI is a total waste of time.

It's compact and lightweight and takes excellent quality photos, excelling at high ISO speeds.Design wise the Fuji is retro and classy looking.  The overall look is very similar to a lot of Fuji's other cameras, like the X100 and X20.  I own both of those cameras as well, and while the X-M1 does look very similar to them, materials quality is nowhere near as high.  The X-M1 is pretty much a completely plastic affair, whereas the others are made of metal.  Despite this, the buttons and dials have a positive feel to them and everything is well assembled.  Even better the plastic construction keeps the weight of the X-M1 light, even with the 16-50mm kit lens attached, and is easy to carry all day long.  Let me put it this way, I recently came back from a week long vacation to Disney World and I had both the X-M1 with the kit lens and a Canon 5D Mk III with the 24-70mm f/2.8 lens with me and I found myself choosing the Fuji over the Canon more often than not since it was so much easier to carry throughout the day and photo quality is almost as good.  One thing I'd like to mention is that the Fuji had a spot on the sensor that I had to clean off manually since it was showing up as a blob in photos.Features wise the Fuji is well stocked.  Its best feature, besides the excellent sensor, is the tilting LCD screen on the back.  It's large, high resolution, and bright.  I had no trouble seeing it outdoors or at night.  I used it extensively while on vacation to shoot over peoples' heads.  I missed having an optical viewfinder at times, but the tilting screen makes up for the lack of viewfinder.  It has all of the requisite manual controls, but the maximum shutter speed is 1/4000.  I prefer cameras that go up to 1/8000 so I can shoot with a wide aperture in daylight and not have to carry a neutral density filter with me.  The auto ISO setting is very customizable, with options for slowest shutter speed and highest ISO available.  For those who want the camera to do all of the work for them there is also an automatic mode and several scene / creative shooting modes.  The Fuji lets you bracket by exposure, ISO, film simulation, and dynamic range.  The small built-in flash is not very powerful, but can be pulled back to serve as a bounce flash.  The Fuji also has built-in Wi-Fi, but it's pretty limited in that you can only transfer photos to a phone and geo-tag photos by borrowing your smart phone's GPS.  Plus I found the Wi-Fi clunky to use.Besides the clunky Wi-Fi the Fuji is very easy to use.  The menu system is logical and easy to figure out.  It's quick and simple to change shooting settings using the two command dials (which both easily fall to hand), and there are hard buttons for white balance, drive mode, and autofocus.  Lastly, there is a customizable button, and Fuji's excellent Q menu to gives you quick access to many shooting settings.  One thing to be mindful of is that it is very easy to bump the top command dial and change the exposure compensation.  One button I didn't understand was the Macro button.  Since the macro distance is determined by lens attached, I couldn't figure out the purpose of this button, and the owner's manual didn't explain anything.  Speaking of, the Fuji actually comes with a pretty comprehensive printed manual.The Fuji is a pretty quick camera overall.  It turns on quickly, however, you have to wait a second for the exposure to \"equalize\" so you can see the image on the screen.  Focus times are always around 1 second, and the Fuji rarely hunts.  It achieves focus accuracy about 99% of the time. Maximum continuous shooting speed is 5.6 fps and the Fuji will take about 13 RAW images and many more JPEGs (I stopped at 35) before it starts to slow down.Photo quality on the X-M1 is excellent.  Color, detail, exposure, and the look to the photos are great.  Overall, the Fuji creates very pleasing images.  The sensor is excellent and shoots at high ISO with aplomb.  I was able to shoot up to ISO 3200 without worrying about noise and detail destruction.  Above ISO 3200 is OK, but I reserve those setting for emergency use only.  Dynamic range is also great, and the sensor holds onto highlight and shadow details well.  Taken as a whole, this sensor stands toe to toe with the best sensors in this class of camera.  In fact, it's better than the sensor in my Canon 7D, and slightly better than the well-regarded sensor in my Fuji X100.  I shoot all of my images in RAW and convert them using Lightroom, but even if you shoot JPEG you'll still get excellent images overall since the Fuji has a terrific JPEG engine.  Video performance was good as well with fairly quick focusing and good sound quality.The kit lens performs well and gives fairly detailed images overall with corners that hold up nicely, even when the lens is wide open.  It also has a built-in optical image stabilizer.  Included with the lens is a hood, but it's hard to get on and off, and you have to remove the lens cap first.  Still, at least Fuji gives you one... I'm looking at you Canon.Battery life is good and I was able to take a couple hundred photos, with extensive menu navigating and photo reviewing, before I half depleted the battery.All in all... a terrific choice in the mirror-less interchangeable lens camera class, and there are some excellent Fuji lenses available for it as well.P.S. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have and I'll do my best to answer them.02/24/2014 Update: Fuji has updated the firmware for both the camera and kit lens.  The camera now works better with Fuji's 56mm f/1.2 lens.  The kit lens now has improved image stabilizer performance.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible Number of Features Making it a Suitable Non-DSLR Alternative", "Author": "NyReckDiver", "ReviewID": "RUUFF0HM51SLF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Fujifilm X-M1 is a fantastic secondary camera for any professional or advanced  photographer or any photographer who wants to engage in discrete street or travel photography, IF you can get over not having a viewfinder (it is difficult).  In my opinion, the camera is intended to compare to the Panasonic\u2019s GF6 and Olympus\u2019 E-PM5.  I would also say it is an advanced level camera for those photographers who are progressing from phone cameras or lesser point and shoot cameras (be prepared to be amazed)- IF you are ok without a viewfinder.  FujiFilm designed a high performance X-mount camera fitting into the X-Pro1 and X-E1 lineup of premiere mirrorless cameras, inheriting the retro factor many manufacturers are returning to (the latest being Nikon with the DF). Without a doubt, this camera has a place in your bag, with some minor, but not deal breaking, issues; issues you would only really notice if you have been shooting for years. These minor issues are far eclipsed by the impressive and well known 16 megapixel X-Trans APS-C CMOS sensor offering some of the best color rendition in a jpeg I have seen as well as a \u201cfilm simulation\u201d mode.  Like many cameras these days, the optical low pass filter has been eliminated, allowing for even sharper images.I received the camera with the 16-50mm x-mount Fujinon lens. The camera comes very well packaged and Amazon did a great job with the shipping box as well. The camera comes with the NP-W126 battery, charger, shoulder strap, CD-ROM (w/ RAW converter), lens, lens hood, and manual.  Upon first inspection, I find the build quality OK.  The camera is largely built with what appears to be high carbonate plastic with magnesium alloy on top and bottom plates (standard for this class of camera).  Sturdy by all means, but hard to get used to when coming from cameras with better build quality such as a Nikon D800 or the Fuji X-100s. But clearly, the price point reflects the level of build quality in comparison to the higher cost X-100s.  I found the build quality to be as good or better than the Nikon P7700 or P7800, which I believe is a close comparator.  The camera has a front grip as well as a back thumb rest.  For those wishing to improve upon the \u201cbuild feel,\u201d I would recommend the Fuji Bottom Leather Case (BLC-XM1) or the HG-XM1 Fuji Hand Grip.  I previously read a rumor the X-M1 would be weather sealed, but I find no evidence of weather sealing, which is not really a deal breaker unless you are a pro and using the gear under very adverse conditions.  The camera feels good in your hand (better with the leather case however) and can easily be used one \u2013handed.  The weight of the camera without the leather case seems to what most people will look for when discussing build quality and feel.  Paired with the 16-50 lens, I found the weight well distributed and balanced.  The lens mounts to the camera in a solid connection, so I give kudos to Fujinon\u2019s Quality Control.The design of the camera is very good, though not providing the advanced features of the other two X-series cameras, the X-Pro1 and X-E1, which Fuji labels \u201centhusiast cameras.\u201d  The X-M1 features  a three inch 920k pixel TFT LCD that tilts through an 180 degrees.  This means, you can shoot those very tough angles (think pets). The screen is sharp with accurate color rendition, and seems to handle glare fairly well, a major issue when you do not have a viewfinder. On top of the camera is a mode dial to change between automatic and manual modes, or to switch to shooting in scene mode (automatic). The X-M1 also has a large thumb dial on the top and one on the back for changing aperture, shutter speed and exposure compensation.  These are a little close together for my taste, but usable.  These two dials also set this camera apart from entry-level compact cameras.  The onboard flash, which pops up, is one of the bets flash units I have seen with this class of camera.  Nevertheless, I recommend either buying or fabricating your own light modifier to diffuse the light.  This will improve results dramatically.  Some reviewers reported issues with the wi-fi.  I had none.  I also tried an Eye-Fi card, with no problems.  The wi-fi establishes an ad-hoc unsecured network in transferring images; easy but unsecured.  You can transfer images to your phone using the free Fuji Camera application.  There is also an additional application called a Receiver for people you may want to share images with- the difference being you can select images for transfer with one app but not the other.Camera performance is very good and strives to provide that performance through DSLR similar features.  In general, it is usable at weddings and in street shooting.  High action sports will require a much faster camera in my opinion.  This camera is best suited for event, portrait, wedding, street, and travel; typically those situations not requiring the fastest of shutter or focus response times.  ISO range is 200 through 25,600 extended.  At or below 400 ISO, I detected no noise.  Usable images through ISO 6400.  At that point, noise is too much for my tastes (I hate noise) though higher ISO\u2019s are usable, even desirable, for certain gritty street photography looks.  As I said before, the sensor is the strong point of this camera and is inherited from much more expensive models.  Color rendition is fantastic and images are tack sharp when the camera is used correctly.  Exposure control uses TTL 256-zone metering with Multi, Spot, and  Average controls with typical exposure modes found on DSLR cameras.  Shutter speed maxes out at 1/4000, keep this in mind for daylight (full sun) portraits.  Focusing is provided via 49 area contrast detection with manual, multi AF, area AF, continuous and tracking- all of which worked superbly in my use. For some reason, Fuji provides two startup modes Quick (0.5 seconds) Start and Normal (1.0 seconds or less). I find this a little odd.  Just turn on quick start and leave it there. I found very little shutter lag overall.  There are far too many features for me to continue listing and I would suggest you take a deep look at the manufacturer specifications if you need more information than provided in my review.Overall, I found this camera incredibly usable in most conditions in which I would not want to lug around a DSLR kit.  The issues I had with this camera are based on (a result of) my years of pro DLSR use.  Specifically, I think build quality could have been a little better and a viewfinder should have been included.  The lack of a viewfinder may deter many pro\u2019s and advanced level photographers from using it as a non-DSLR backup or supplement. Regardless, this  camera packs in a lot of advanced features for the end-user and would be a great \u201cbridge camera\u201d on the way to DSLR shooting.  The manual controls and features will easily allow someone to learn basic functionality of DSLR manual shooting without the price and commitment of DSLR gear.  For example, it is a great camera to learn exposure and focus control as well lighting.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "I got what I wanted and more", "Author": "Peter R.

However, after using this X-M1 camera more, the plastic material didn't bother me as much. I ended up really appreciating the lighter weight carrying this thing. Don't let the plastic and small body fool you, this thing takes fantastic pictures without all the DSLR bulk and physical controls to still feel like you have a DSLR power in your hands.When it came to point and shoot cameras, I was never a fan of Fuji... Canon/Sony were just miles better; however, this camera has totally changed my view about Fuji. When it comes to Mirrorless Hybrid DSLR camera, Fuji is definitely stepping up to the plate.I own a Canon DSLR and L lenses, but I've actually been using this Fuji X-M1 the most now because it's just easy to carry around without sacrificing image quality and have advanced controls at your finger tips.This camera is geared more towards power shooters and it would be a waste for someone who just wants to point and shoot; there's a reason why there's many dials on this thing.I really like the use of the buttons and dials on this camera. When viewing photos, you can use the dial right next to the side of the LCD screen to zoom in and out; you can also press the down button to max zoom instantly or when it detects a face, it'll max zoom and crop to the face automatically. You can press down on the scroll wheel to zoom back to 100% or the Menu button too. There's just many ways to navigate with the added controls. I like it, but for someone who wants simplicity and is a beginner, the controls will definitely feel overwhelming and intimidating (like when you first hold and try a DSLR)EOS M has the quietest shutter noise compared to the X-M1 and NEX-5R. The X-M1 and NEX sound equally loud.Pros:- The LCD can tilt to be able to shoot extreme high angle and low angle shot- Quick focusing (unlike the Canon EOS M)- Light and easy to carry. Takes nice DSLR quality pictures without all the bulk!- Pop-up flash where you can tilt the flash to bounce off the ceiling for more natural lighting- It has an external flash shoe - it works with my Canon/Yongnuo flashes (of course in Manual mode)- Physical buttons for quick access (easily switch aperture and shutter speeds and ISO; two dials; function button; quick movie record button)- At ISO3200, definitely still usable.- Cool retro camera body look (I received the black one, but I really wish I could have owned the silver one!)Cons:- LCD cannot do 180 degrees like the Sony NEX for self-portrait shots. (If it it had a flip-out screen, it could do everything)- Not touch screen (Touchscreen is no gimmick - it makes it much easier to navigate)- Very very plastic build quality (Some may be turned off and surprised and feel that it's really cheap like I first did)Overall, if you want DSLR quality pictures, easy-to-carry and lightweight, as well as having advanced controls and high/low angle tilt screen, this camera is definitely worth checking out.

The kit 16-50mm kit lens and body are solidly built with no wobbly parts. It has a plastic mount and outer coverings. Supplied lens hood works well.This is Fuji's attempt at capturing the mass market sales and deviates from the more expensive models such as the X-E2 which has more direct control buttons. The X-M1 lacks a touch screen function to more easily select the focus points and Q menu items. While not essential on the higher end models with direct access buttons, the X-M1 can definitely benefit from touch screen.XC lenses are designed to be more compact and affordable, so the aperture ring was dropped. I wish they retained it as it is characteristic of the X-cameras and a feature that attracted me to Fuji.While the kit zoom has IS in the lens, Fuji should examine the option of providing in-body stabilization like the Olympus micro  FourThirds cameras. Fuji's excellent prime lenses do not have in-lens stabilization, so having it in the body would be great. Although the prime lenses have fast apertures, night scenes still require shutter speeds in the sub 1/20 sec range.I chose the X-M1 for its compactness and am very satisfied with the portability. The images have great color and low light shots at high ISO are very good. Video is acceptable and not quite up to Panasonic standards. This is an area that Fuji needs to address and rethink some lens designs. While the newer zooms are video compatible, the original prime lenses have slower focus and noisy motors that would detract from the video experience.Price of the X-M1 is in-line with competing products with similar features. Adding in-body stabilization would push the price up.

I'm also not going into detail on the picture quality - you'll find countless reviews on other sites with side-by-side examples.)Here we go!- The shutter lag and autofocus speed are much faster than the X100 which is notoriously slow by any account.  Just in case you thought you needed an X100S (or better) to have a responsive Fuji camera, definitely not the case.  The X-M1 is terrific.- Picture quality, it's on par or better than the X100, easy.  While I've never shot film I've always been a huge fan of Fuji film and while no self-respecting SLR photographer would admit to this I'm going to  - I do end up using and liking the in-camera Fuji film effects: Velvia, Provia, etc.- Build quality... well I'm always mixed here on the small(er) bodies since I'm used to holding on to tanks like the D300.  The first thing you'll notice is that the XM-1, sans lens, feels and grips a bit like a hollow plastic box.  It's 1/2\" smaller in width about a 1/4\" shorter in height than the X100 and that small difference means I'm holding it with my fingertips instead of wrapping my hand around it the way you'd be used to with an SLR or even the X100.  Once you throw the a lens on, it gains a bit more heft and since your left hand (assuming you're right-handed) cradles the lens, you'll feel a bit better about the build.  The lack of a viewfinder (which I'll discuss next) mitigates this because you don't need to have the same grip control you'd need if you would be bringing your eye close the body.- Articulating back panel; I just don't see the utility.  When extended, it feels tenuously attached to the camera and with thin plastic arms, it's another thing that can break; why bother?  That feature seems out of place on this camera.  Will you really be throwing it on a tripod and looking straight down on it?- No viewfinder and no after-market options.  After years of shooting, it's just ingrained in me to pull the camera up to my eye.  If I ditch the XM-1, it will be for this reason.Overall these compact ILC bodies are starting to look like very attractive alternatives to lugging around piles of SLR gear.

If you aren't familiar with the X-A1 it is basically the same camera as this, with a different sensor and is a little cheaper.  The question most people will ask is: \"is the extra cost of the X-M1 worth it over the X-A1?\"  I hate to say, I am going to give you the answer: \"it depends\".I have been pretty thorough at looking into image quality differences between the two mostly shooting in RAW, and it is really hard to tell the difference, but there is a definite edge to the X-M1 after the images have been processed to make the amount of noise/grain similar between the two cameras.I find the X-M1 to offer slightly less image noise at all settings, so you get slightly cleaner high ISO and even cleaner low ISO.  Also, when you apply some noise reduction to the X-A1 images to get them similar level of noise, the X-M1 has a bit sharper images.There is one physical difference between the X-M1 and X-A1, and that is the X-A1 has a textured rubber grip and the X-M1 has a faux leather grip.  I prefer the X-M1 grip slightly, but difference is very minor.Which one would I buy?  I would probably save a few and get the X-A1 personally, but the X-M1 is in fact slightly better.

I would say I have owned about a dozen or so digital cameras since then - from the point and shoot variety to Canon semi-pro SLR's fitted with \"L\" glass. I'll be completely honest, however, and admit that I mostly shoot in automatic mode. I suppose I'm just lazy, but I really have little interest in learning much about manual exposure or RAW file conversion. I have a decent eye for composition, and as such have created some beautiful photos over the years, despite eschewing most of the advanced features my cameras have offered. Thank-you technology!I offer this history to illustrate why I am enjoying my new Fuji X-M1 so much. I didn't need to even so much as crack the manual, and I was taking beautifully vibrant, practically noise-free photos, two minutes after the battery completed charging! Sure, I know my way around the menu system of a digital camera reasonably well, but all I really needed to know was how to set the date and time and I was taking excellent photos using the Fuji's Auto mode.I will say I did have to get used to where and how to hold this compact, rangefinder-styled camera, as I have pretty big paws. It's not a camera that you just pick up and your hands naturally fall where they are supposed to be. I've owned several cameras that have just felt natural in the hand, but they were usually larger, big-zoom point & shoot and SLR models. I think the Fuji X-M1 strives to be foremost a compact camera, albeit one with excellent image quality, so some trade-offs with handling have taken place. But once I got used to how to hold this little beauty, it felt pretty natural after that.Start-up, auto-focus, and shot to shot times (even with flash) are very respectable - though not quite higher-end SLR speed - but definitely neck in neck with an entry-level SLR and the very best point & shoot cameras I have experience with.I was able to shoot several hundred photos, some with and without flash, and take a few short videos, before the included lithium-ion battery needed recharging. I suppose you could pick up a spare for vacations and such, but I don't feel it's strictly necessary.The 3-inch display is sharp and vibrant, and the tilting feature is awesome for framing photos at waist height without having to crouch down. The display washes out a bit in bright sunlight, but you can adjust brightness, though I didn't personally find it necessary to do so. Some people are lamenting the absence of an EVF (electronic viewfinder) on the X-M1 - I am NOT one of those people. Personally, I am moving away from the traditional SLR style cameras, in favor of more portable offerings. Along with the X-M1, my day to day camera is a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black A compact and versatile camera with an impressive lens, but no match in image quality for the Fuji's huge sensor. Even though the Panasonic has a pretty good EVF, I NEVER use it, and I certainly don't miss it on this camera, either.I wanted to get an idea how well the Fuji processing engine and sensor combined to handle a common challenging photo situation. An inferior camera will have difficultly resolving the darker areas of a scene with a brightly lit background, such as a sunlit window with venetian blinds, in an unlighted room. Even on automatic mode the X-M1 photos were evenly exposed, with the camera using a fill flash to even out the exposure. The sunlit window was somewhat blown out in the very brightest areas but still very clean and viewable. The problematic darker areas of the scene were perfectly exposed, and noise was almost non-existent even at an ISO of 800. Just as importantly, purple fringing was completely absent at the high-contrast interfaces. A very impressive performance indeed, by Fuji's X-M1.I think perhaps I need a bit more practice with the video mode on the X-M1, but so far I'm not overly impressed with it. I noticed the camera seemed to have great difficulty staying in focus as I walked about my apartment. It was very slow to re-acquire focus during almost any movement, and did so quickly only at the widest lens setting, and with very bright light. I didn't buy the camera for it's video features, however, so I'm not too upset over this apparent shortcoming.I was surprised to find a reasonable amount of red-eye present on the few photos I took of people, thus far. I used the Auto Portrait Mode but I don't think I got the proper face detection I needed for the automatic red-eye removal feature to kick-in. At this time I won't blame the camera for this, as I think it was operator error. But just realize people shots may not be completely \"idiot-proof\" in the auto mode, and could require some practice to perfect. (And consulting the manual - goodness forbid!)I'm finding the Fujifilm X-M1 &16-50mm kit lens to be an excellent choice in a compact \"walk-around\" camera. I love the \"vintage\" rangefinder styling, and I intend to also get the Fujifilm X-M1 Leather Case (Black)to both complete the vintage look, and improve camera handling.I took one star off my rating for the slower video focusing, and possibly a tendency for some red-eye, but this is surely one of the finest cameras I've owned in some time.**** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! - 4 STAR ****", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great photos", "Author": "Michael McKee \"mystic cowboy\"", "ReviewID": "R3AE2B3ERFGCDD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If I just look at the photos this camera makes it's a five star camera all the way. I have a friend who sings the praises of the Fujifilm X-trans sensor. He's right. It does offer a bit extra over other APS-C sensor cameras I've tried. I have a hard time describing that something. Maybe it's a richness or three dimensionality in the photos.On the other hand, I wouldn't say this camera is something I'd recommend to an experienced photographer, though it's priced in that ballpark. It lacks a viewfinder and Fuji is a little behind the competition when it comes to the latest and greatest in camera technology. The camera has a nice and bright viewscreen, which even tilts. I like that. However on a camera without a viewfinder the ability to touch focus on the screen is really nice. This doesn't have that. It has wi-fi capability but only to export photos, not to control the camera. We've been able to do that with Eye-fi cards for the last few years. Fuji is a bit behind on that.Don't get the idea that I'm down on the camera. I used it on a recent trip and got some nice photos. The kit lens is better than average. The camera has two control dials, which I appreciate. The quick menu brings most settings up with a button push, though, again, a touch screen would have been nice. The build is plastic but very solid and seems durable.The screen has good color and is bright, though in even December days in Arizona there were some shots I had to guess at framing because the sun washed out the screen, even when I shaded it. While I like the old fashioned range finder body style, I would love a bigger grip. The fake leather covering on the camera body is slippery and I don't feel comfortable using just one hand with the camera.Since no camera is perfect we have to take the not so good with the very good. Again, I'll state that this camera is capable of making beautiful photos and has some pretty decent controls. However, if you are upgrading from a phone or point-and-shoot, I'd recommend going with the X-A1. It's a lot less money. If you're an experienced photographer look at the X-E1 or the new X-E2. They have viewfinders. For me, the X-M1 is a bit too expensive for the controls it offers and the image quality isn't that much better than the almost identical X-A1 (different sensors-same number of megapixels) that's a couple of hundred dollars less expensive.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like it so much", "Author": "Chang Luo", "ReviewID": "R2LJJ1T4OM8TSF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like it very much!

I was very impressed to find that the X-M1 offers a large number of customizations.  One can adjust iso, shutter speed, f-stop, etc.. but also shoot in automatic mode.  For those novice users looking for a beginning camera, the X-M1 may be too much bang.  The 16-50mm lens is a nice fit for the X-M1, but its protrusion doesn't make it very pocket friendly.  I'm accustomed to using an EVF that I found it very foreign to use the X-M1.  If you like your EVF then the X-M1 is probably not for you!  The touchscreen is capable but lacks a tap-to-focus/shoot capability that my old Canon T4i had.  The flash, despite being small in size, was surprisingly effective at illuminating my subjects.  However, the significant downside of the flash is that it must be manually toggled.  I tried every possible automatic setting without luck.  This seems like a poor decision and perhaps is indicative of too much manual control needed to operate the X-M1.  Lastly, jpg picture quality out of the box was excellent.If you're an intermediate-advanced shooter looking for a customizable moderately compact camera more capable than your usual point and shoot, then you may want to strongly consider the X-M1.  If you're a beginner shooter then you should probably look elsewhere because the X-M1 offers too much customization and manual operation (e.g. the flash).", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Image Quality, But...", "Author": "Wildness", "ReviewID": "RI03ERXIEOHCC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was really looking forward to putting this camera through its paces, and the image quality of the photographs the Fujifilm X-M1 captures is stunning. The X-M1 has the same sensor as the XE-1 and X-Pro1 and thus the same image quality. The colors are vibrant on the JPEGs the camera produces and the RAW files process nicely through Lightroom. I used the camera up to ISO 1600 and have been very impressed with how well this camera controls noise at those higher ISOs. Another thing that Fuji gets right on all of its camera is the \"Q\" menu, which gives the user direct, easy, and quick access to the settings that most photographers will use regularly... ISO, Auto Focus settings, Dynamic Range, Noise Reduction, crop format, file format, film look emulation, anti-shake and more. The standard menu system is organized well enough, but could use a little more tiding up. The LCD screen is bright and sharp and allows for different views with more or less information on it (and a custom option as well, which is nice).The biggest surprise on this camera is the kit lens - the consumer-oriented 16-50mm lens. Though it is a big plasticy and the zoom ring and focus ring are too close, the lens really does take very nice images. The other plus is the focus ring is smooth and stiff enough as to prevent it from creeping.Overall, the build quality of the camera body is very nice and solid, but the camera has two major issues for me that brings the rating down to three stars. These may not be a big deal for some users and thus not be a detractor, but for others, I think that many will have the same issues. The first issue is the lack of any kind of viewfinder; for me, that is a major negative on a camera of this caliber. when not on a tripod, I find it impossible to properly compose a photograph holding the camera out at arms' length. Plus, vibration reduction or not, a camera can not be stabilized in such a manner. The other issue, and this one is a major one if you use this camera on a tripod as all cameras should be whenever possible, is that the Tripod socket is right next to the battery door... I mean 1/8 inch close. There is not a tripod quick release plate made that will allow the battery door to be opened when a quick release plate is attached. Frankly, that is down right asinine.It is these two issues that should leave this camera off the wish list of any professional or serious amateur photographer; instead consider the X-E2 or the X-Pro1. If you never plan to use a tripod and you don't mind holding the camera out to see the LCD screen, then otherwise this is a very nice option.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic compact camera", "Author": "Amilea Mea", "ReviewID": "R2P17N0RY9L6GH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the weight and the size of this versatile compact camera.

I own many expensive cameras and can fully appreciate various  features and build qualities. The bottom line should how good is your photo.

This drastically reduces weight - for many this is a real plus. This camera has a super plus in one has access to X system lenses of which many are just superb.The lens has a very typical range for a kit lens yet provides sharp and beautifully contrasted photos.My Jpegs are just stunning and is one likes loves some of Fuji famous film  - you can set the camera to do that!Bottom line - beautiful photos, very light, apsC sensor and a lot for your money and the X system lenses. A pleasure to use.If you want a long review Dpreview -- it gives their Gold rating.I been using the camera more today - the photo quality, color,dr etc just beautiful - the quality just stands out and the lens quality is also amazing. There are times when manufacturers include stunning optics in a plastic mount lens. This is clearly such a example.A joy to use and my photos look like they were taken with my other famous brand camera costing six times the cost. I judge a camera as to how beautiful the photos are rendered.With further use I did notice one downside In low light a little slow on focusing and taking the photo.

Reader", "ReviewID": "R56H8OMC4GFOE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm by no means a pro photographer. I'm at best an enthusiastic amateur. I have never taken any classes or done much more than read some articles online when picking out point and shoots. My other experience with compact systems was the micro 4/3 Panasonic GF1.Anybody stepping up from a digital point and shoot will immediately notice an increase in capabilities. Shooting is faster, pictures are clearly and most especially you'll be able to take decent low light photos for probably the first time since you stopped using film. The camera itself is easy to use on auto modes right out of the box. (You'll need an SDHC card first.) Likewise the kit lens is pretty good and will do everything from wide to zoom.All that being said, if you're not willing to put in the time to get to know this camera (or in some cases the money) this probably is not the camera for you. There are much easier cameras out there to use like the GF1. The menus on this bad boy are difficult and confusing to use. I've read through the instructions twice, and taken about 2000 photos with it, spent hours and hours using it, and still need to dig a bit to find certain menus and am hitting wrong buttons. Money wise you may find it requires a little investment to get the most out of this camera. I'm partial to the x mount pancake lenses that are roughly equivalent to 35mm (theres a couple of them), they will run you nearly half the cost of this kit, but are worth IMO. It makes this camera truly lightweight and compact, not to mention quicker to shoot, which IMO is the real strength of compact system camera versus full size DSLR. Its a shame a pancake lens was included as kit option. You also might want to invest in an optional flash, though that is less needed as it the pop up flash is pretty darn good with this camera. Unfortunately one of the things you cannot spend your money is an EVF. Which would be nice for outdoor shots where it can be hard to make out the screen. (You can find an option to turn on outdoor mode for the screen which helps a bit by boosting the brightness.) The last negative is the wifi upload system. It is terrible on my iPhone and iPad. I'll try it again with my Mac, but it just seems like nearly 3/4 of the time it can't connect. You have to turn on wireless on the camera, then join that network with your device (The camera initiates its own unsecured network) then get back to the app and hit connect. And cross your fingers. Mostly for whatever reason it doesn't work and I have to repeat. I'm gonna just stick with using the card to transfer.All of those negatives aside, once you get to know this camera and begin to not have to scout the book every 30 minutes it really does deliver some amazing shots with a myriad of options. For the most part Auto does a pretty good job with settings. (You cannot adjust a lot of setting while in auto mode which is a pain, particularly at night time.) But in all the other modes you can. All the standard modes are here with nothing really out of the ordinary, with the exception of maybe the fujifilm FILM modes which is kind of a neat touch once you realize what each film type excels at. Also if using the kit lens you will be disappointed with the focus speed for quick shots, so be prepared to work around that.In conclusion, a great, stylish camera at a very fantastic price point... which is achieved in part by just an ok kit lens which you should replace with a pancake lens ASAP. Also to get those fantastic shots you're gonna have to spend a lot of time getting familiar with quirky buttons and menus and dials. There is no onscreen help to speak of and no touchscreen to make navigating easier. If you value simplicity and don't want to get into the details of minute settings like white balance and ISO's, I would recommend something more along the lines of the Sony Nex/Panasonic GFs. However if you're a pro or already know what to do or find you need much more control than your P&S; allows this is an excellent choice, so long as you have the patience to learn it all.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Something like NEX-5R and PEN-EPL5 (But It's still a great Camera)", "Author": "Hunter", "ReviewID": "R1DFZ4SHQDD9LO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just to save some complainers the time- if you so need a viewfinder and you supposedly \"would have been interested\" in a fuji small X camera- there's the fuji x-e1 which is at a great competitive price with not an optional but built in with you at all times best in class resolution evf.Look, it even has shutter and exposure compensation dials so you can feel even more of a pro because you really absolutely needed that view finder that only photographers in the know absolutely demand and require to do any kind of photography like yours.Maybe an equally good and honest question would be \"Does the RX100 have interchangeable lenses and offer entry into a full camera/lens system?\" The answer on this one is a huge NO. The RX100 also won't be able to compete with the X-M1's DOF control and ability to render better background blur/subject isolation because the RX100 doesn't have the X-M1's much larger APS-C sensor. There are plenty of us who think that having such a small sensor results in too great of a creative limitation because of its limitations in DOF control. And, of course, there's a lot less creative control when you lack the ability to change lenses, too.Overall, the X-M1's feature set and form factor places it squarely up against cameras like the Sony NEX-5R and Olympus PEN-EPL5.Sony NEX-5RB0090QXG92Olympus PEN-EPL5B0096WDMGCRX-100B00DGQK2GM", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "No panorama mode (unlike the x100s, Xe-1 and most cameras!)", "Author": "graph101", "ReviewID": "RLCLJ7RFY5M18", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'll focus on the issues because there are so many options out there for mirrorless cameras and most will take amazing photos.1) No panorama mode and No builtin HDR. This camera is suppose to be \"easy\" to use, a starter camera for the x system. I don't know why fuji left these features out.2) It would also be nice if the self-timer included multiple photos after countdown ends. like canon/sony/panasonic cameras. The feature is great for group photos. The timer on this cam is very basic.3) The camera loves to use 1/30sec instead of pumping up the flash. I guess this is the intelligent flash system fuji is referring to. Why bother setting mininum flash speed when it ignores it? (i set it to 1/60 but fuji would rather go slower and higher iso than use a stronger flash).4) When face detect is on, you cannot set the focus area at all on any focus modes. Selecting a focus area should override the face detect.5) object tracking only lets you take a single photo. you need to re-track the object after 1 photo. the whole point of tracking is to take multiple shots while following an object.6)Added issue: RAW is a pain to process. It takes 7seconds for an 18mp canon raw to zoom at 100% VS 14seconds for fuji RAF to zoom at 100%. IT also takes 2x to develop to JPG in lightroom.  I can accept this IF fuji had builtin HDR, panorama and other JPG-only features most cameras have nowadays.Hardware7) On/Off switch is too small8) Tripod hole is too close to the battery door.

First, there is no viewfinder on this camera. You have to use the LCD screen to frame your shots. In addition to this being quite awkward, it makes the battery run down very quickly. Personally, I feel more detached from a scene when viewing it on a screen versus viewing it through a viewfinder. It makes me feel like I\u2019m shooting pictures on my phone, not on a $600 camera. The second feature I dislike is the pop-up flash. I don\u2019t dislike the idea of the flash or even the execution. What I dislike is the fact that even in the most automatic mode, the flash doesn\u2019t pop up on its own. If you don\u2019t remember to manually release it, you don\u2019t get a flash even if the picture needs one. Maybe after more use with this camera, I\u2019ll be more inclined to remember to always pop the flash up, but it\u2019s just one more step that can stop you from getting the shot.The picture quality on this camera is good \u2013 but quite frankly I don\u2019t think it works as well for me as my current camera, a Canon Rebel T3i.I think this camera has a lot of potential. I love the compact size of it \u2013 it is a lot less bulky than most cameras of this quality. The old-school look of it is also very appealing.

I want to give a layperson's review...not one for the pros, persay.The body is very light compared to other DSLRs.  Though nice, it created an awkwardness for me when it came to the lens vs. the body.  Granted, you will usually have a body vs lens weight difference, ESPECIALLY as you attach larger lenses.  However, this is a basic lens and it causes an uneven keel to the camera.  That's just me.  I guess I like my body to weigh more than or close to what my lens weighs.I missed having a viewfinder.  I'm not sure why Fuji left it out but I consider it a no no.  You, well, I, just can't get a feel for my subject looking through something else.  I will say the way the screen tilts and comes out is most convenient.  You can lie the camera on the ground, adjust the screen, and still see what you're shooting.  That is a big plus.The dials and, most importantly, the single button for video recording.....NICE!  These are what helped pull my 3 up to a 4.
