Nice micro fiber cloth though to clean camera lens. PowerShot SX160 IS is a fabulous camera for price, it comes with features that are normally available on cameras that will cost you hundreds of dollars more. Heres a link to Canon website great tech info and reviews [...]JUST BUY IT YOU WONT REGRET IT. MY WIFE LOVES THE RED color.Beach Camera is awesome Amazon partner.

THIS ONE NOT!!!!  The flash takes forever to recycle and after each picture it flashes busy forever.  If you want to take pictures quickly in sequence this is NOT the camera for you.  Also, the pictures seem blurry on many of the images.  I have setting to auto hoping this would remedy the problem and many of the pictures are blurred.  I bought this to take pictures of my niece at graduation and my granddaughter's dance recital.  I am VERY disappointed.  Did not get any good pictures at either event.  Will look for another camera to take on my upcoming cruise, a throwaway digital has to be better quality than this.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "4 stars", "Author": "Lynn M.

I haven't messed with the camera a lot yet, but was taking great pictures on 'auto' right after setup. Seems to be a great camera with good zoom factor and good in low light.

I had considered getting a larger camera  but I injured my rotator cuff on my left shoulder and can only use one hand right now to take pictures. That poses a problem for someone taking Digital Photography classes in college.
