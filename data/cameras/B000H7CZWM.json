{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera, upgrades from previous stylus models", "Author": "Concerned One \"Thrashfan\"", "ReviewID": "R1TO67SZIW3AFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the stylus 710 that I have had since september of last year, and love it to pieces.  Little did I know olympus was relaseing this little monster onto the market 2 months later.  It has all of the features and software of the 710 model, with digital image stabilization, but5x optical/5.6x digital/28x total zoom , an upgrade from 15x total zoom (3x optical and 5x digital).  The price is about the same, and actually an excellent deal here on amazon. The 2.5\" color LCD monitor with histogram display and auto image rotation has been standard in the 710 and 810, and the 1000 series, and I have not problem with it, I think it is comparable to all models in this range (panasonic, fuji, kodac, hp).  I the bright sun, no LCD is going to be really great. I have captured many fun moments with this camera (2 weddings, 2 vacations) and love it. The diffence with the 740 model is the thickness is a bit bigger due to the bigger optical lense, but that is well worth the sacrifice, because having more optical zoom = better picture.  I know, I tested this side by side with my 710.  Pick this up, you will not be dissapointed. Also, look at the 750 and the 760 models, both of which have optical image and digital image stabilization, but alter the zooms a bit.  Compare, and see what meets your needs.Also, the Olympus Mastersoftware is very easy to use, And with panoramic feature, 3d, and Extra ART Features unlocked by Olympus Brand-Olympus Stamped Type H HD, this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own. you can edit photos on the computer, or right in the palm of your hand. Both ways, this camera will make you feel like a pro in no time.", "Date": "February 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Highly portable, durable camera, great shots, bad lcd screen", "Author": "Eric J. Bott \"MadEB\"", "ReviewID": "RSBQHUJW9TQNG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love every aspect of this camera except one.I recently took it on a three week vacation to China and the photos I took are stunning.It's very light weight and fits well in a pocket.It's durable, weather resistant, and can really take a beating.Extremely user friendly.The automatic settings work very well.  I'm particularly impressed with the under water and use available light settings.  They can be a lot of fun to play with.It turns on and can be adjusted to the right setting rapidly with little experience to grab shots on the go.It looks cool.The gyroscope technology works.  You can take focused shots from a moving bus on a bumpy road or while walking.The only drawback, and it's kind of a big one, is the lcd screen.  There is a thick, protective plastic screen over the actual lcd screen.  In bright light, (like out doors during an average sunny day), you can barely see the screen.  If you're in the desert, on a mountain, in snow, or some other ecseptionaly bright setting the screen is black.  You can not see a damned thing.  To compensate for this I occasionaly had to take 5 photos of the same thing to make sure I got one that was centered ok.Still, I'm very happy with this camera and would buy it again even knowing about the screen problem.", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera To Hide in Your Pocket", "Author": "Dr. Frank C.

A friend had a problem with the battery charger on his 740  and sent in for replacement. Shoot most of my photos with 8MP Canon Digital Rebel XT (SLR) with External flash and 18-200 zoom. This camera (740) allows for great \"back-up\" when I don't want to carry around the Huge Monster(XT). 7MP plus 5X Optical Zoom cannot be found in a better, smaller, lighter package. You can stick this in you pocket when going out to dinner and noone knows you are carrying a camera. I also often wear this in a belt pouch (like a cell phone) and am ready for an unexpected foto op at all times.

Now the part about the viewer not working in bright sunlite is a bit of a problem but, if you just use your body to block the sun from the viewer it will work just fine. I don't see how you could find a much better camera without a viewer built in like some have. I really don't see that it is such a big deal that it doesn't have a viewer.

It takes great pictures that are equivalent and somewhat better than the digital SLR I bought two years ago.  The buttons and features are easy to use and the display is very clear.

I am not a digital camera novice so when I read the negative reviews, I assumed they just didn't know what they were doing.  Well, I was wrong, this camera is horrible!  It takes great shots outside but you can't tell that when you take them b/c of the lack of a viewfinder, it is all but impossible to see the picture you are taking.  That's just a minor inconvience though.  The major problem is that all of the pictures of my daughter's first 4 months of life are so grainy as to be unusable.  This camera is the worst I have ever used indoors.  No matter what setting you use, it is terrible!  Unless you only plan on using it outdoors in the shade, do not buy this camera!

The size is even smaller than I expected, and the color is a dazzling blue.It has a lot of different settings for different environments where you'll be taking pictures. The ones I've used the most - a document setting for taking pictures of documents (I have no copy machine or scanner so this comes in handy when I need to scan an item), a setting for cuisine (I like to cook and share my recipes online so this comes in handy when sharing my food with others over the web), and available light (uses whatever light is present in the room without using a flash - helps when I'm trying to avoid red-eye or get a more natural look to my indoor pictures). The available light setting will cut down on the image quality  if the light present isn't sufficient. It also has a museum setting that automatically shuts off the sound of the camera so that you don't disturb those around you in a quiet setting.The fact that it's so cute and tiny is a big bonus - I love showing this thing off!The only thing I find is missing is the view finder. I understand that it might be to cut down on the size of the camera, but taking pictures in really bright light - you miss it. I couldn't see a thing on the screen during sunny days - even the \"brighter screen\" didn't do much for it, and the light on a sunny day is so intense it's hard to even find what the light balance view is reading. This is a serious design flaw and I seriously considered returning the camera for this reason - it's just too cute and little to return though. It's great for bringing to parties and as a general picture-taker that is slim for traveling. The fact that I don't have to worry about the weather when I take it with me is a big plus as well.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "G.

I should have gone with their reviews.  Maybe I don't know how to use this but I have never taken so many blurry pictures in my life.  I have considered getting my old film camera out and using that again instead.  I tried to take several pictures of my son goign down a little hill on his sled but none turned out, all blurry and/or too dark.  I was very disappointed as we were visiting grandma and we don't get snow where we live so this was a one-time opporuntiy.  I like being able to carry it in my purase at all times to take last minute shots but what good is it if they don't turn out.  I'm constantly correcting them in Photo Shop and there is only so far you can go before they start looking grainy.  Anyway had I not waited a year to really try it out I would have returned it and checked with Consumer Report to see what would be a good buy.  I still may just give this to my 4-yr old son and get a better camera for me.  We didn't get nearly as many good shots on our Disney vacation as I would have like.

Also, if I take pictures in the school gym, like for the school concerts, they ALL come out blurry. I thought that perhaps I just needed a professional camera, but then tried my sister-in-law's point and shoot fuji camera (can't recall the model) and it was WAY faster! And the photos she e-mails me are a lot sharper and have better color. My olympus has a lot of \"features.\" I do like the candle light option, and I like the one when you hold the trigger down and it takes a bunch of pictures one after the other.
