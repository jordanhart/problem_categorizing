{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Great Little Camera for the Cost with the Quality You Expect from a Nikon", "Author": "Gordon Olivant", "ReviewID": "RNRXAB65XJJOD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased the Nikon Coolpix L620 on August 30, 2013 to replace our 2008 vintage Coolpix which was lost in a white water spill after 5 years of great pictures. Several days after receiving the L620 we headed off to Great Smokey Mountains National Park for a week of relaxation and pictures. Several hundred pictures later in a variety of compositions and lighting we return giving the L620 high marks.  Needless to say the 18MP images render a sharp crisp picture. We didn't buy this camera to take low rez pictures so all of ours were at full resolution. In non flash situations the camera was able to recycle in less than a second between independent pictures. When a flash was used, often as a fill flash which produced amazing results, there is a noticeable time between pictures approaching 2 seconds which was not a problem at all. The 14x zoom was great when taking wildlife pictures although the automatic settings resulted in a slower than desired shutter speed resulting in a few blurred images. Perhaps the most impressive result was the vibrancy of the colors, exceeding expectations for a camera of this size and price. Performance in low light and foggy situations was notably good.Now for the rational for the 4 rather than 5 stars. We purchased the L620 in part because it uses 2 AA batteries rather than rectangular customs. With our last camera on several occasions we found ourselves without a spare battery so the ready availability of AA's made dealing with the lesser battery life a reasonable compromise: carrying an extra set in our pocket is easy. In a variety of lighting situations ours averaged 73 pictures (again at max resolution and mixed flash) over the trip (Duracell NiMH 2450mAh). Not bad performance. What was surprising is the lack of warning that you were about to run dry. In our previous 2 Coolpix a warning appeared in the view finder several pictures prior to the battery running dry. With the 620L there was little warning and in two cases the batteries died with none at all (yes there is a little battery in the view finder but it is not at all precise).  For a company of Nikon's reputation this is a miss that needs correction.One suggestion, get a high capacity/quality memory card (we used a 32GB SanDisk Extreme) as it is worth cost for the capacity.All in all I would give the L620 a strong recommendation and look forward to years of use.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "No low battery warning and eats batteries.", "Author": "\u2713Ono\u00f1dageg\u00e1", "ReviewID": "R3VVL6PZ6A3338", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": null, "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Experienced Exhausted Battery Issues 1st Day along with Horrible AF Delay", "Author": "Gabrielle", "ReviewID": "R25XE78CB0QI3I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was a really disappointing purchase since I wanted a high quality P&S; camera to replace my 7 year old Kodak Easy Share. I had it for maybe 3 hours and took at the most 20 photos when the battery died on me. Thinking it was the brand new batteries I had just put in (yes, straight out of a package - not from the camera box) I replaced the battery to have the same thing happen again. It happened mostly when trying to record video and then would happen with snapping photos. While there may be some explanation for this (I tried using a different card - changed and checked all the battery and image quality settings, etc.) I was very aggrevated that it happened and it wasn't clear to me how to stop it from happening. Having the camera shut off after taking 5 photos - is not acceptable. I made the mistake of buying this without reading these reviews first. Another major issue is the horrible delay in the auto focus function. It take forever and I got so many blurry photos. In the end I returned the camera and am sticking with my 7 year old Kodak.  Really horrible product - such a surprise.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Bang for the Buck", "Author": "John Tremain", "ReviewID": "R2PGRE622P12V3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a quite simple to use and quite capable camera for a great price. It takes very good pictures. As long as you have some sense of how cameras work--or are willing to learn--this camera will do it all. The optical zoom is superior, the ease of use of the controls is wonderful. This is Nikon quality--and they hit the ball out of the park with this one. Only someone who expects unrealistic things would be disappointed with this camera. I found it's abilities in low-light and other somewhat difficult environments to be surprisingly good. Very sharp photos with the 18.1 MP. And it serves as a very nice HD video camcorder as well! It is not too big--and not too small--and the feel and grip of it is just like you would want it to be. It downloads into your computer with ease.

This camera has everything I need plus more.  The quality of the photo and video is very good.  The quality is \"real life\".  My previous camera did not have such good quality.  As it is now, I don't even use the highest setting because I always download my photos into electronic storage and always lower the quality so it doesn't take up that much space.The camera is fast to take pictures.  however, on the highest quality setting the camera slows down.  It takes time to save the picture onto the memory card after each shot.  The highest setting takes the longest and lower settings are faster.  The flash is fast - it will go as fast as the pictures will.  So the speed is not affected by the flash.  It takes pictures at the same speed - whether the flash is up or not.The zoom is good, but not great.  I was hoping for a greater digital zoom.  It has a good one now - but my last camera was better, so I had higher hopes than I should have.All in all, the camera is light and economical and is very good for the average family user.  It uses AA batteries - which was my main requirement.  I travel all the time - AA batteries are mandatory for me.I would recommend this camera for anyone a good quality camera that takes high quality pictures.My only complaint is the zoom - but that was because my expectations.  The zoom is good as it is.

The controls on the camera are fairly intuitive for a point and shoot camera.  It gives the operator the option of being involved with all of the options as they want to be.  You can have as much control as you desire over all of the different settings.  The camera takes wonderful photos and great 1080p video.  We have discovered that you can get more photos between battery changes if you use rechargeable batteries.  The camera is nice and compact and fits in the hand well for great shots.

The pressure from the batteries against the battery door is strong making it a bit challenging to open and close, no problem, but it eventually took it's toll on the tiny plastic fold that holds the door shut and I've only had the camera for a few weeks (bought it Christ-mass eve).I needed to buy rechargeable batteries because the batteries that comes with it won't take video for long before it stops recording and says batteries exhausted.Forget taking sports pictures, baby pictures or anything that moves unless it's dark and you take it in low-light setting, otherwise it's just blurry regardless on the settings you choose. I've tried every setting and unless the subject sits still it's very hard to prevent the blur, especially when the flash is not in use.Using the flash decreases the blur considerably, but natural light is often more attractive in pictures.I'm very disappointed in Nikon for this camera, I expected a lot more for this name brand.

Byrd", "ReviewID": "R12WRB3ZOP0W2P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am a dermatology resident and I like to take photos of skin conditions.I had a Canon point-and-shoot (can't recall the model number, but it was about $300 according to my wife) that leaves this thing in the dust. Unfortunately I lost it.On the \"easy / auto\" mode it takes forever to focus, and often it does not focus well at that. On the macro mode it is no better. Then (I guess due to smaller processor?) it takes longer to register the photo on the screen and save it in preparation for the next shot. The Canon camera would automatically adjust the photo horizontal vs vertical on the display when reviewing photos depending on how you are holding the camera (similar to the iphone) and this camera does not do that. Despite this camera's 18 mega pixels, photos don't look as clear -- even when taken on the higher quality settings. Finally, it requires 2 AA batteries and consumes them quickly -- keep an extra pair on hand!I wouldn't buy it again. I wish I had my canon back.

This product blows it out of the water though its an unfair comparison as the Cannon only is a 7.1 MP while this is 18.1 MP.PROS: A lot of filter options available to you and a couple of smart auto features.  I love the ability to use the Night vision mode to take some incredible night/dusk shots.  I was able to zoom in on the moon and set the filter to dark and earned myself some great pictures of the moons craters.  I wish I could upload the photo to show it.CONS: easy mode auto feature: when trying to take pictures of young ones that can't sit still, it will choose a slow shutter speed which always results in blurry kids.When pushing the button to take a picture half way to focus, it will sometimes take up to 2-5 seconds before the camera is ready to take a picture.

My last camera had a mix of auto settings such as night portrait, landscape, etc. as well as manual settings, which was helpful. This camera (save for ability to set exposure) lacks the manual settings option - but it does NOT need them. It takes absolutely amazing shots in low light - even without flash and keeps the shutter open at just the right length - without having to manually adjust it. We took shots with the Canon DSLR and my new little Nikon, and the Nikon L620 was easily producing better pictures without no effort. I took a picture of my boyfriend standing in a dark hallway, no flash, and it took a great shot. You will love this camera if you want indoor shots during the day or night that look great.
