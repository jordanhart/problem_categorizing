{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Olympus 770 SW: A little gem", "Author": "Rich L \"Frequent Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R325VSSRO33HAU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have an Olympus 770 SW (NOT the 720 SW), for sure...and I like it. I have had five digital cameras before, and this one is terrific. Considering that it's a sub-compact pocket camera, image quality is fine (not equal to that of a digital SLR, but I don't want to carry around a big box like a DSLR). Shadow detail is especially impressive. Operation is smooth and intuitive. The screen is fine, even outdoors. Shutter lag, a big concern of mine as I like to photograph my kids at sports, is minimal and can be zero if you prefocus. The number of custom scene settings is impressive. I bought it because of the waterproofing and shockproofing, and because of prior good experience with Olympus over the years, but I'm just as happy with the pictures it takes under normal circumstances too.A few gripes that stop me from giving the camera 5 stars:1. The battery cannot be recharged when it's in the camera. For a total of $80 or so, you can get an external power source and a cable, and together they let the camera run a long time without draining the battery, but they don't charge the battery. Battery life is fine for a day of normal shooting, but if you use the camera actively, every single night you pretty much have to unlock the case, take out the battery and charge it, then remember to put the battery back in the next day. Each charge takes 5 hours. I'm going to take the same $80 and instead buy two extra batteries to be comfortable--One in the camera, one reserve along with me, and another charging at home. Even so, it will take some planning and thinking to keep batteries ready all the time on a vacation. It would have been much nicer to have a holster or a charging socket on the case.2. The case is actually smaller than it needs to be. It could be significantly bigger and still fit in my shirt pocket, which is my standard size requirement. As it is, the advanced engineering is impressive to pack all the features in a tiny box, but the camera is more expensive than need be, the lens is smaller than it should be (depending on zoom position, the lens is between f/3.5 to f/5.0, which is pretty weak), it's harder to hold the camera than need be, and if the case were bigger, there would be room for a nice little charging socket too.3. There is indeed a background, almost mechanical noise introduced when filming videos. It probably can be filtered out, as it's very constant and very low pitched, but it's mildly annoying.4. Time between shots is too long--it takes several seconds to save each shot at full resolution.5. You can use the internal memory only if there's no memory card in the slot. Given the slow transfer speed to the card, it sure would be nice to be able to save a dozen or so shots very quickly to the internal memory and then transfer them to the memory when you have time.For all that, though, I'm really looking forward to using this camera on a forthcoming sea kayaking and snorkeling trip this summer. With one camera, I'll be able to take snapshots above and below water, also modest videos underwater (there's a special scene selection to do just that)!", "Date": "March 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great for what it is. Not a primary digital camera.", "Author": "Anonymous Italian", "ReviewID": "RXBW18MQ4XMCX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Salt water spray has claimed two of my previous cameras so when I read about this camera and the Pentax Option W30 I decided one of the two would be a very valuable investment. The next question was deciding which one to buy.The Pentax is a superior camera. Colors are more saturated, and it has lower noise higher up the ISO range. Also, the Pentax produces videos that are 30FPS (the Olymmpus only goes up to 15FPS) which is a huge advantage. Also, the Pentax uses SD cards, which are available at higher density and faster speed.The Olympus, on the other hand, is much more bulletproof.First of all, it will survive down to 30' whereas the Pentax is limited to 10. I wanted a camera that could survive light snorkeling. I routinely breath-hold dive to 12'-15' and I'd hate to have a camera on me that I would worry about. With the Olympus I just do whatever I want.Second, the Olympus is crush proof. I can slap the thing in my backpocket and sit on it and not break it (I weigh about 190#). I can get on my boat, throw the thing on the deck with the rest of my gear, and watch it bounce around unharmed. The Pentax is just not that strong.In the end, since I already have a camera that takes brilliant, vivid pictures with great resolution and also takes great video (a Canon SD550) I decided rugged was more important than marginally better optical rendition. I figured the Olympus would take acceptably good pictures and I went with the Olympus.I'm not disappointed, but I'm not thrilled.The camera is every bit as waterproof and bulletproof as is claimed. I've slapped it around, thrown it, had it around the boat, seawater, sun, kids, and it's just fine. I can take this camera with me on the boat, take it with me swimming and snorkeling, and it will work when I'll want it. A camera is only useful when you have it and I'm not afraid to have the Olympus with me at all times in any environment.Having said that, the picture quality stinks, I suspect as a result of the lens design dictated by the water resistant qualities of the camera. In bright sunlight, with the ISO set to 100 (and even up to 200 it's not bad) there is no significant noise. On the other hand, the colors appear washed out and dull compared to similar pictures taken with the Canon. Its resolving power is also inferior to the Canon and there's no question but that I'll continue to use my Canon in environments that are friendly to it (like, no salt water spray risk).  On the other hand, since I can't take my Canon everywhere, I love having this camera; I recently went to see America's cup practices in Valencia and I'm happy to say I have a couple of shots of Alinghi that will make decent poster prints. They'd look better taken with my Canon but....right, I would not have taken my Canon in that environment, so...Focusing delay is very short, as is shutter delay. If you prefocus, the shutter delay is non-existent. Without prefocus, it's less than a second: not bad. On the other hand, shot to shot delay is annoyingly long, a couple seconds at full resolution.Image compression is average. In the best quality mode you can still see some compression artifacts but the average person will not notice. If you do know what to look for, you'll find it annoying but not a deal-breaker.I bought a 2Gb H Xd card, and it's pretty fast but not as good as high speed SD. Also, it's nowhere near the density that SD has reached, but 2Gb will go a pretty long way.In short: buy this camera to take it in places where other cameras fear to go. Don't buy this camera if all you want is great pictures for the backyard or the trip to Disneyland.Ah, almost forgot. Buy a large styrofoam float and attach it to the lanyard. If you lose the camera over the side of your boat, it's nice to be able to go back and pick it up.", "Date": "June 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "5 stars but not perfect", "Author": "GinAZ", "ReviewID": "R1QMQULX0TZBWH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera deserves 5 stars if you need a camera that easily fits in your pocket or purse and is ready to use whenever that picture or movie moment arrives, even under water. Considering the varied picture taking situations, action, and lighting conditions, the performance was beyond my expectations. The only significant limitation is seeing the display in bright sunlight or under water, even when the screen is set at its brightest. However, aiming was intuitive enough that I never missed a shot and I was able to change modes even under water (but I did practice switching between underwater wide 2 and movie ahead of time). One feature that would be an improvement would be the ability to zoom while taking a movie.I received this camera just a couple days before leaving on a cruise so I didn't have any time to practice with it. Be careful not to have your finger in front of the lens, especially under water where you may not be watching the screen. Also be aware that when you zoom in for movies that the image movement is also magnified. The wide angle underwater movies are much better than at full optical zoom (digital zoom is off). After a couple days the controls were easy to use to change modes and review pictures and movies.I used 1 gig cards and the highest resolution which provided about 240 pictures or about 40 minutes of movies. Switching back and forth was easy. Movie recording will continue until the card is full or the battery runs out, not just short clips. My clips were too short until I was comfortable that I would not quickly fill up the memory card or run out of battery. Under water pictures were superb with a natural shift in color toward green. I recharged the battery every other night. The battery was able to take about 100 pictures and 15 minutes of movie between recharges. I recommend a spare battery as it did indicate it was getting low a couple times and ran out once.The camera was also used in daylight, inside, with and without flash, even night shots (the auto setting was better than Night Scene for harbor lights at night. The camera was steadied on the railing).I purchased a lanyard with metal clasp at Sports Authority for a dollar which provides a very secure leash. With the lanyard around my neck I could tuck the camera in my shirt pocket. I was always ready for the next picture opportunity without worrying about dropping it.I'm very pleased with the picture quality although it may not match a camera with a much larger lens system, but it was great to be able to take pictures and movies when I would not have had my larger camera available. The 15 fps movies do not match a 3CCD digital video camera, but they are acceptable. I even recorded short clips during live theater performances (with the screen brightness set at its minimum) and I was pleased with the quality from this tiny camera.", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC digital camera", "Author": "microscopyproducts \"microscopyproducts\"", "ReviewID": "R19CRR7USQUH2I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used digital cameras for several years, among them the Olympus C-50, Olympus C5000, and my main SLR, Canon Rebel XT and a few others. I bought the 770SW for a trip to the Galapagos Islands so I could snorkel and free dive. It was purchased a month early so I could get accustomed to the camera.  This is the first digital that I have used without a viewfinder so that took some getting used to.  The criticism that one can't see the LCD in bright sunlight is VERY true but that is true of most digital cameras with or without viewfinders.  I could see it underwater but not great.  None-the-less I could aim it approximately and got some really nice shots. Posted one of a giant turtle and a pelican, which landed on my head thinking I was a rock. The interesting thing is that one doesn't have to change the settings if one shoots underwater mode (far) as it also takes great above water shots.  Once you dive below the sun level or greater than 20 ft, the pictures get bluer and bluer as one expects.  For scuba I use a Nikonis with a slave strobe, which is really necessary for good shots when one gets 30 or 40 feet.  BUT for snorkeling, this camera worked great.  In salt water, I can't go as deep anyway without weights, so had no problem with enough sunlight. Using the flash underwater would be OK if the water was perfectly clear, but the water was rather rough in many places and had many particles, so the flash would have bounced off all those particles and produced photos with spots anyway, unless you were trying to get that special effect.  Actually had enough light for good shots as the ISO the camera sets itself to when set for underwater far.  I suspect that is 400 or 800 since I didn't see much movement in the photos AND the current was strong as May is winter in the Galapagos.  I would suggest purchasing the H-chips (i.e. xD cards) rather than the M-chips as the H-chips are faster which means you can shoot faster to have more chances to get that GREAT shot.  I used the 1GB xD cards.  To minimize or eliminate the sand problem, after use on the beach or snorkeling, I repeatedly washed the camera in fresh water while I continually opened and closed the lens (by turning the camera on and off).  I did not have the problem that some people talked about of the mode changing when the camera was turned off.  Mine doesn't do that.  I was concerned about a couple of reviews that I read that the images were soft.  NONE of my images are soft.  They are very sharp and have blown them up to 11 x 14 without problems.  I personally feel that one should throw away the wrist strap immediately and buy an inexpensive lightweight neck strap and put it through the same hole. It cost me $9 at my local camera store.  I lost an Olympus C-50 as I was getting off a sightseeing bus with it around my wrist, and the person behind me in a GREAT hurry pushed me, the camera slid off my wrist onto the cement 6 ft below and that was the end of that.  Thankfully Olympus had a policy that if you send in a camera and $150 (as of 2005), they will repair it regardless what the problem is.  Believe me that C50 had LOTS of problems which they repaired to make it like new.  Anyway, a neck strap is a MUST as far as I am concerned.  Can't judge the panorama function as for the most part I take overlapping photos and stitch them together in Photoshop, which works great.  For indoor flash photos, one must be within 8 ft or so and not have high ceilings, then it is fine. I also increase the ISO to 400 or 800 for inside shots if there is a great distance.  Obviously one introduces some noise, but many times useable if I don't have another camera around to use.  It would be nice to have more flash power, but guess one can't have everything especially for the price and size.  If it is reasonably bright inside or outside, the photos are of good exposure, and sharp for blowups.  I haven't noticed the white balance issue that one reviewer referred to, altho I think that was on inside pictures.  When I do take photos when it is dark inside, I do use the Photoshop filter \"highlight and shadows\" more.  I was surprised at the battery life I got.  Expected to go through many batteries in a day so bought a few to take along on my trip.  Never used more than two and usually only one battery with all day shooting and 2 snorkeling trips.  They do sell two types of batteries and suggest getting the one with the longer shooting time.  I now carry this camera EVERYWHERE. Buy one of the skins, which go around the camera to protect it from scratches.  It was only $11 at a local camera shop.  No it doesn't replace my Canon Rebel XT, but it takes great photos especially in bright situations and does underwater and you can even drop it (haven't tried that one out).  It is so small, fits in my vest pocket and barely know I am carrying it.Definitely as far as I am concerned, this is a MUST HAVE camera.", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Waterproof new, Yes.

The scene mode stopped and each time I want to go from looking at the pictures I have taken back to taking pictures, I have to restart the camera.

Just bought the 770SW and thought I'd test it out. I shot a series of indoor, outdoor, and macro shots, using the same focal point, with my old 2MP Fuji and the new Olympus. I shot at two different quality settings on each and with an array of camera settings (canned features, white balance, iso, etc). No zoom. Then I downloaded them and compared them side by side. Even after 7 years and 5 more megapixels, the shots with the Fuji had truer color and better focus.

I just wanted something I could take underwater and this certainly fits the bill.It's acceptable as far as digital cameras go, but I don't know if I would use it as my main camera.A couple of things I've noticed when using it -1) The white balance seems a bit off a lot of times - especially when used with the flash indoors.2) The screen is pretty much impossible to see underwater and in bright sunlight at the beach.I took it snorkeling this weekend and took a lot pictures, but most of the time I just had to guess that the picture was framed at what I wanted to take a picture of.

There is a delay from what you see and what gets taken as a picture, but its is much quicker than typical camera from two years ago.All in all this camera does its job, and 7.1 Mega pixel brings the quality of the photo up once you get it back to the computer.(P.S. what Olympus calls Royal Blue is what the rest of us call Purple.)My rating for all other Amazon purchases equals 5 stars out of 5 stars.and I would rate my first 770SW camera at 4.5 outta 5 for price/qualitybut the second camera 770SW is pending a rating of 0 outta 5 unless Olympus does something amazing and pays shipping.", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for adventurous people", "Author": "Zurcher", "ReviewID": "ROD78GPZXRL3N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera rocks.  I had the previous model (720SW) for about a year until a friend decided that \"waterproof\" included opening the battery compartment in the pool. (FYI: opening the battery compartment while the camera is underwater is a Bad Idea). I took it as an opportunity to upgrade to the 770SW, which is basially just an updated model with some added features.If I am remembering correctly, the Silent Mode is new, or at least much easier to access (it's right there in the main menu).  Very handy.Second are the new specifications as \"crushproof\" and \"freezeproof.\"  With my experiences of snowboarding with the 720SW, I can say that it can definitely take a beating, however it does hurt to land on the camera while it is in your pocket.The 720SW did display some aversion to the colder temperatures of the mountain, as it would occasionally refuse to power on when the lens cover froze shut.  (This is generally avoidable as long at you don't get the camera covered in snow.)  I am looking forward to seeing if this issue has been addressed with the new 770, as the added certification seems to indicate that they have worked on this very problem.Also, the new flashlight is great for macro shots as well as lower-light shots when you don't want to use a flash.  It also works decently as an actual flashlight.Finally, the manometer (altimiter/depth meter) is an awesome addition.  I haven't had a chance to test it underwater yet, and the altitude sensitivity only goes in increments of 600 ft, but still, it is a very original feature for a compact digital camera.The only real disadvantages with this camera are low-light shots, and the field of view of the lens.This camera needs a lot of light.  It is definitely not the camera to use if you are trying to take artsy night shots of things, and even low-light snapshots can sometimes require the flash.  It lets you crank the ISO all the way to 1600 at full resolution (and a 2500 ISO can be had by switching to the faster of the two rapid-burst modes, though this sacrifices resolution), however some graininess starts to show at about 800, and at 1600 and 2500, low-light shots can become sand-paper grainy.In addition, the picture field is a bit limiting, as the most zoomed-out setting feels a little narrow, and the closest zoom isn't extreme; then again, the amount of zoom is impressive considering that there is no extending lens assembly and all the moving parts stay safely inside the case.Overall though, for its size and utility, this camera is still a great choice for the outdoors enthusiast (or as a gift for the ever-clumsy family member).Lastly, if you currently own the 720SW and are considering upgrading, I would say that right now it's not really worth it.  They didn't improve the sensor as far as low-light goes, and while the new features are nifty, they aren't worth another few hundred bucks.  As a new addition though, I would definitely recommend this camera.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Conquered Green Turtle Cay with this camera!", "Author": "J.P.

I have had three Olympus stylus digital cameras, and for me and my family this change to spot dramatically improves the quality of basic point-and-shoot in full auto mode.  My personal opinion is that the ESP mode makes too many compromises and results in an overall least-common-denominator selection of focus and exposure that isn't a very good choice for many photos.True that you can't see the LCD outside in bright sunlight.

I have taken over 16,000 pictures in those 4 years.  I am an active young person and my cameras go with me anytime I am out on the town or the beach or anywhere with friends and family.  I started with the C-50 and went through 4 of those.  The C-50 was a great camera in its time, but the slide mechanism wore easily after use and the the camera was in general very fragile.  I lost one and broke the others.I owned 2 of the C-60's.  The C-60 was a much improved camera, but the slide mechanism still weakend with use and it was also very suspect to dust and debris with its style of zoom out lens.  The picture quality of the C-60 was much better overall than the C-50.This 770SW is tremendously better than the C-60 or any other camera.  It is thinner, there is no pop out lens to break or catch debris.  The overall picture is just slightly better than the C-60 but I thought both had a great picture.  The 770SW excells in close up and fast moving pictures.  I rarely see a blurry image anymore and anything up to 5 inches away produces a perfect picture in the right mode.  Purchase the XD high speed card with this camera and take pictures faster than with any other olympus.Where this camera blows past every other point and shoot is in its duarability.  It blew my mind last week that I could jump in my pool with this camera and take under water or just out of water pictures without hurting the camera.  I purchased the skin with this camera and it keeps the camera completely scratch proof even after dropping it or losing it to the bottom of the pool...with the exception of the part right above the lens hole.  The only minor negative is that the skin is somewhat sticky and makes it hard to store in a pocket and pull out quickly.

I was concerned about reviewers who mentioned soft images and image quality. I'm fairly critical when looking at images, and I believe there is little to worry about for 90%+ of users on that score. We used the camera over a week in Orlando, through swamp boat rides, log flume rides, swimming pools, snorkeling, and pretty much everywhere and are very happy with it and our results.Pros: Solidly built and appears to stand up to the dropping, submersion, and crushing Olympus claims. Fit easily in velcro pocket of cargo shorts. Good feel in the hand (balance, button placement). Picture quality has been well above expectations (see comments under cons below for caveats). I found the menus to be easily learned and intuitive (some reviewers don't like the menu set-up). Others mentioned battery life, but in fairly heavy use (over 100 exposures per day, many with fill flash, and lots of \"power on time\" reviewing pictures on the LCD), we never ran the battery to zero (we did charge every night though). The LCD is bright and clear and just excellent.Cons: There is a notable delay from shutter press to firing, even when pre-focused. The delay is about the same as a 2003 era point and shoot, and we were easily able to overcome this by anticipating most of the time. The only place this was an issue was snorkeling after fish and trying to get them in-frame and in focus. They do not like to stay still, so the delay was a bit tough in that pursuit, but I still got some good shots with persistence. The flash is quite anemic. Very weak. Much much worse than a typical p&S; flash these days. There is no viewfinder, which is an issue when trying to shoot using the LCD in bright sun. A few times we'd try to cup our hands over the LCD to try to line up a shot. The lens is in a position where one might inadvertantly have a finger or two in frame, but this is again easily resolved with some practice on hand position. Images tended to lack deep black tones and may appear somewhat washed out. This is easily fixed in Photoshop by hitting control L and bumping up the black level (moving the left-most triangle slider to the right) on images. Image quality with some light Photoshop work was excellent. Even the anemic flash can be somewhat overcome by brightening in the \"level\" function of Photoshop (moving the right-most slider left). Also, the camera is not buoyant AT ALL, so if you are in deep water, maybe you should get one of those floaty straps. In snorkeling, the included wrist strap worked for me, but I can see how in open water one might want something more floatable or more firmly attached to the diver.The cons list is long here because I wanted to give a full honest appraisal of the camera, not because I'm trying to be critical. None of these cons stopped us from getting the pictures we hoped for with this camera.The short version of this review is that this is a seemingly bulletproof camera that has worked great, and helped my family get a lot of great images of things we never would have had otherwise. The joy on our 2 year old's face as she leaps into daddy's arms in the pool (from the splash zone), our ten year old son's snorkeling adventure, the grandparents getting drenched on various log flume rides, a squirt gun fight, everyone getting soaked in a tropical downpour.

I was wrestling the BC off my back and simply forgot to get the camera safely off my wrist. I couldn't find it right then, panic. My boat was anchored and was sweeping at a 30 foot arch in the wind enough to activate the drift alarm so I GPS marked the spot and stabbed a spear gun into the sea floor roughly where I thought I needed to return. It was getting dark so knew I would have to return next day at first light to do a systematic search for it.Next morning we returned for I found a fellow to help me search. He splashed around for a while as I directed him from the boat. I became impatient and jumped in and swam where I thought the target area to look should be. And there it was. s you can imagine I was quite happy to have found it. I had a lot of pics oin it and it isn't the cheapest camera either.Now, I picked it up and turned it on and started a video right there in the water. It worked fine after sitting there over night.I have dropped it from table height too and it still works perfectly.I took it to a cold high mountain river in New Mexico and shot a little video under water last week just sticking my hand under for a few seconds. Still works just fine. It took breathtaking shots off of the  Sandia Crest looking out at Albuquerque. Also, \"breathtaking\" because it was at over 10,000ft alt and I wasn't acclimated quite yet. I took the cable Tramway up there in the afternoon so I could catch a sunset then eat at the restaurant. I do that every time I go there. Fantastic view. The dinning was far better this time than back in 1974..then it was horrible.I'm buying another one of these 770sw's.

After owning two fantastic Canon digital point-n-shoots, and a Canon 20D (SLR), I was swayed by the camera store rep to buy the Olympus water and shock resistant unit. I think it is a great camera, but I do say that with some reservations and additional comments.1. Olympus uses not only an annoying proprietary memory card but also a unique mini-USB jack. Why they would skip the industry standard MINI-USB jack used on every other camera and on my BlackBerry is beyond me. These Olympus-only image storage and transfer devices are extremely frustrating when trying to share photos with friends. I just got back from a week long trip with friends and having forgotten my cable, I had no way to share my photos while on the trip, while the Canon users could swap photos with ease. xD and proprietary USB must go!!2. Cycle time - even on this new 770, slower than I would like.3. Battery life on my 720 was shorter than on my old Canons - buy at least 2 batteries. Battery life is shorter than my old Canon SD cameras. Oh, and the 720 charger has a huge cable on it so you may want to see if the 770 continues that useless tradition. I much prefer the compact Canon units with integrated plug - the power cable is an annoyance when trying to pack light!Now, in light of these reservations and annoyances, I have had enjoyed my 720SW. I don't have to worry about getting it wet or dropping it (I also purchased the silicone skin) which is a huge relief for someone like me who takes their camera on ski trips (and frequently crashes) and other vacations. Images print 8x10 no problem.

This camera can go just about anywhere.  I've taken it on a waterfall rappelling trip in Costa Rica, to hot springs, other places where there's a good chance of being splashed (like on boating trips, or sightseeing near waterfalls), to dog beach, in the snow, etc.  Plus when I'm on vacation, I can take pictures outside even if it's raining now (this was one of the main reasons I wanted a waterproof camera).  I also take it places where there's a good chance of getting dirty, like a dog park with dusty dirt that gets everywhere (and dogs that seem to particularly enjoy licking camera lenses for some reason), or on the sand at a beach.  When this camera gets dirty, you can just hold it under running water to clean it.  The water evaporates off the lens nicely, with no spots.  I can also keep this camera in my purse all the time without worrying about damaging it.  I don't have to be careful, I know the camera is going to be ok in there even if I drop my purse or bang it into something.The picture quality isn't the best ever in all lighting conditions (although it's about what I would expect from a mid-range compact camera), but the camera makes up for it by being able to go places that other cameras can not go.  Photoshop autofixes generally fix the image quality enough to make me happy.  Even unaltered, the pictures are mostly acceptable.  I will upload some un-altered photos as soon as I get around to it.It has so far proven to be a very durable camera.  I do use a case for it most of the time (especially when it's in my purse), and I actually read the manual regarding care, and follow the care instructions to make sure it stays waterproof -- for example, I always inspect the rubber seals around all the doors (especially the battery/memory card door which I open all the time) before going underwater.  No issues at all yet.I have no complaints about battery life.  I don't know how it would do if I'd used it as my primary camera on vacation, but one battery lasted about a week with limited use (basically any time it was raining, in any situation that would make me worry about my other camera).  Possibly longer, I'm not sure.I can't really comment on the scene modes, I usually just use the \"P\" mode.  There are just too many scene modes and I don't want to have to keep figuring out which is the right one to use.

I never actually plugged the camera into my computer so I'm not sure what the data transfer speed is when used that way..  I use memory card readers, and even my old regular speed sd cards seem a lot faster than this xd card (which is an Olympus 2gb card).

I started with the Sony Mavica with the 10X optical zoom with 800,000 pixels that saved to 3.5\" floppy disks.  At the time, it was a great camera and only cost $1,000!  Next I moved to a later generation Mavica with 2.5 megapixels and a 10X zoom that saved to a floppy OR a smart card.  It only cost me $650.  When that camera was stolen, I moved to a Kodak with 5 megapixels and storage to a mini disk.  It also had a 10X zoom and was smaller than the previous Sonys.  Cost $420.  I also bought my wife a small Sony.  I forget the model, but after about 4 months of owning it, the display screen got cracked, rendering the camera useless.  The price to repair was as much as the camera cost originally ($200).  I came to the conclusion that the design was poor and voiced my concerns to Sony and got no resolution.  I probably won't buy another Sony camera based upon that experience.  I have been happy with most of these cameras and always felt like I got good value for my dollar.  The two drawbacks each of them had were 1) size - too big to conveniently stick in a pocket, and 2) susceptibility to contaminants - didn't do very well in water or sand.I am a kayak fisherman along with other hobbies.  However, fishing from a kayak presents one of the most hostile environments for digital/electronic equipment.  None of my previous cameras would have lasted for a week getting the same use I put my Olympus 770 to.  I have soaked this camera in salt water for hours fishing in Florida and Texas.

Actually, I was able to go 2 days on one charge and got about 400 pictures total. Only problem is that you get the low battery warning, and then about 20 pictures left before it won't turn on at all. There's a vendor on ebay that sells a car charger and spare battery for about ten bucks shipped....well worth the extra peace of mind if you think your battery's going to run out. Plus it plugs into the cigarette lighter in the car.I would have preferred a docking cradle, but it seems only low end cameras are coming with these now. My experience with using digitals is that the battery door is the first thing to go, especially if you have to open it every day to charge and remove the card, battery, etc. My last camera was a Casio Exilim that had a cradle which charged and transferred images. That camera lasted twice as long as my others in the past. Since the Olympus is waterproof, I wonder how long the seals will last, opening and closing the door constantly... Had it for a few weeks now and it's excellent overall. Time will tell.The modes are all fairly easy to use. I only had to reference the manual a couple times, but it's worth reading since there are a lot of extra hidden features. There was a review somewhere maybe cnet, saying that the camera didn't remain in certain modes if you power off/on. That's not the case. If you have it in macro, turn off, etc. It'll be in macro when you turn it back on. Same for underwater, video modes, etc. Just press the button with the camera icon to go back to regular mode. It'll hold whatever specialty mode you leave it on.Camera also has a cool flashlight feature (hold Menu for 5 sec) the bright white LED stays on for 30sec or so.Overall awesome. Can't complain.

This camera really isn't for everyone, but if you like to snorkel or get wet on vacation and have need for a general point and shoot digital camera, then this is a must have.It's not perfect, and it doesn't have all the latest features that some cheaper point and shoot cameras do, but the benefit it provides to snorkelers and beach goers on vacation is unbelievable. Prior to this camera the choices were something in a bulky underwater case or throw away cameras that provided unusable pictures, in addition to your \"regular\" digital camera.  It was great to have a digital camera that I could take everywhere, not just snorkeling, but even going into the ocean or the pool. I used to have to chose between beach time and picture time. There's nothing I hate more than having to go back to secure things in the hotel room because I'm afraid of valuables getting stolen from my beach bag. The 770 goes where you go which means less worrying and less planning on vacation. You can't beat that.If you snorkel, or even regularly get wet on vacation and it's time to replace your older point and shoot digital camera, stop reading, you need this camera. The only real decision is whether to pay $100 more for the newer model (1030 SW I believe) with a few more megapixels (10 vs. 7) and a few more of the latest digital camera features like face recognition.For those wanting some usage details, there are lots of useful scene modes, behind glass and food were two I used that worked out well. I really didn't get to experiment much between the 4 different underwater modes but I found the wide/landscape mode that expected fish movement to work well. I found the screen a bit hard to see underwater depending on the lighting conditions, but it's digital so just point in the general direction and keep snapping. The camera is also a bit slow between shots, although I bought this right before leaving and could only find type M xD cards. If you can, try and get an Olympus type H xD card. I'm not sure what the real world performance would be in this camera, but in general they write 2 - 3 times faster than type M cards.One thing you will need to do is work with your underwater pictures in a program like Photoshop. It's not a fault of the camera, just the nature of underwater pictures.

I didn't want to drag along all of the bulky equipment I usually use to video and photograph underwater on one of our dive excursions.

It may commence some strange zooming and definite blue tones take over the images at those depths, but I still have some great shots (you can color correct to some extent with Photoshop anyway).  Amazingly, though, it's not a good surface camera.  There is no viewfinder and you can't see your subjects on the digital screen in daylight.  The above-water images often come out blue and I'm not sure why.  The videos underwater are pretty decent, but blue (as expected) however the ABOVE-water videos are also blue!!??!

It lived through multiple drops, beach visits, underwater dives, snowboard trips, etc, and remains fairly scratch-free and completely operational.

First, having been a life-long canon fan, moving over to the 770 SW called for a full blown manual reading. Everything about the controls, interface, software, etc, is unintuitive. Second, if you ever try to shoot a picture with 2 hands, you will almost always block the lens with your finger, even if your fingers aren't fat. Third, having to preemptively select specific \"shooting mode\" is annoying. This camera does not lend itself well to being a \"point and shoot\" if you have to push 4 buttons to change settings every time you go from night to day. I can't tell you how many times I've left the setting for night shots only to have the first picture of the next day trip be overexposed. Even after adjusting for optimal performance (according to the manual anyway) the camera still takes too long to response (slower than my ancient canon sd110) - making it very bad for action shots.
