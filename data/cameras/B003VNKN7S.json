The old thing had no remote viewing support for phones/etc.This unit is supposed to be supported on OSX with Safari as well as windows and has a very nice user interface. The IOS software is simple and works great. This is a major step up from the (probably OEM'ed from a sweatshop) software on the Gadspot thing.The video quality is good though the framerate is a bit low when things are at their highest resolution. The 4 port version of this unit appears to use the same video encoder chip (or one with the same overall bandwidth) so really all you're getting with the 8 port unit is 4 extra inputs and no apparent increase in recording capability. This is fine by me but it takes a lot of squinting at the spec sheet before its obvious what they've done.I called for support due to a problem with Safari, I was talking to a polite english speaking guy within about 15 minutes and he found an actual answer pretty quickly, I don't think these folks would be willing (or able) to support actual network configuration issues outside of their box but they seem competent with their own technology.My unit is running  firmware 1.53.07_1AE26.Limitations and issues-------------------1) Full setup is not available via any computer based interface, you *have* to connect a VGA/DVI monitor and mouse to the unit to set up all the options, most disappointingly including the recording resolutions and rates on all the channels and the video color/brightness settings.2) Safari is not currently supported. I'm on OSX Lion with Safari 5.1 (which came out a couple of months ago and is, as usual, pushed onto every machine aggressively by Apple's automatic update feature). When you try to log in you get to the point where it asks for your user # and password then it says 'missing plugin' and offers a link with the plugin. The plugin is a .pkg and forces you to reboot after installation :( . Even with the plugin installed it says 'missing plugin'. Tech support verified this is a known issue and is due to Safari 5.1. If you haven't let Apple upgrade Safari on your machine and its still at 5.0 they claim it works fine.3) When safari is working the plugin is the entire UI. There is no web 2.0 style user interface, its a straight on port from their Windows based Active-X stuff to Apple technology. You can't really use this on any random modern web browser as the browser is really just running their native software in a frame (as a plugin). This isn't all bad since they *do* go to the trouble of supporting Safari (no more running XP in a VM!) and the UI is pretty easy to work with, but its certainly not based on modern web technology.The Safari issue isn't fatal since the plugin is really just a standalone program you get to via Safari. You have to install the plugin and reboot. You can instead download their 'Edge' client for OSX (which runs fine on LION) and it provides the exact same UI as the plugin, just not surrounded by a safari window. The Edge client is good to watch live video and export video from the archive by time, it has no capability to go to motion or other alarm events and the fast forward/rewind is limited to about 3x realtime.DDNS/Mobile viewing--------------------The mobile app on IOS is pretty nice and very easy to use (and free on the app store). There is a Lorex Live and Live 2 app, make sure you get the right one for your DVR (the Live app is the one used by the DVR I'm reviewing).Finally, I'm not sure where the folks complaining about their DDNS service are really coming from. The 'Edge' client as well as the iphone (and presumably Ipad) apps just take an IP address and port #. If you have your own DDNS service or a static IP you can just use it. You still need to poke a hole in your firewall and NAT the traffic on some selected port to the DVR but it works fine in that mode. If you don't already have DDNS they offer it for free. I saw some claim in the manual that you can sign up for a service that effectively acts as a proxy so your DVR 'pushes' the video out to it and it copies to your mobile device -- this seems fine for folks who can't or won't set up their network the 'basic' way but I don't think I'd like my video being pushed through someone else's server (and I'm guessing they charge for it since it will burn their bandwidth -- but I didn't go looking for pricing since I'm not interested in that service). That proxy service is definitely not *required* for remote/mobile viewing.EDIT -- after a day of use----------------------The network viewing/control is very definitely a second class citizen and missing a lot of functionality. When you are on the local console monitor you can fly forward and backward and skip easily between motion events on a given channel, when you are using their remote viewer application (and presumably the plugin when that gets fixed) all you can do is fast forward or backward at something like 3x realtime or manually enter a time and go to it. You can't skip to the next motion/alarm/event at all so really if you're looking for something in your recordings you *have* to use the console. This is actually worse than the old GadSpot thing, it was stuck in windows XP land but at least the remote viewer would let you skip to the motion events (well, when it didn't crash/hang). I think the only thing the remote viewer is good for on the playback side exporting video to a file once you've identified a start/end time using the console.Its also highly frustrating they don't have the simplest of straight HTML based viewing (like a URL you get a snapshot or MJPEG stream of a single camera from -- like those little Panasonic home IP cameras). This would allow random web capable devices (like modern 'app enabled' TV's) to at least get realtime camera access.They are trying harder than the other vendors I looked at to make this stuff useful in a modern environment but its still a long way from a real network DVR that can run headless.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible Customer/Tech Service!
