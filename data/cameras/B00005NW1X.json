I thought the picture would be too small, but the pictures came out pretty clear.  The only problem I have is, on occasion, the film will not pull out properly, but it is easy to re-set.  Love it!", "Date": "February 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "Bring this item back!", "Author": "Lacy Harrison \"Pet Fanatic\"", "ReviewID": "R17G61NIN45ZF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this little camera on the clearence rack at Meijer for ONLY $3.00! The biggest complaint I have is that Izone film is EXPENSIVE!  It is fun however, making your own little stickers, it's excellent for leaving memos, working on scrapbooks.  The radio function comes in handy at times too, and has a good sound quality for being so small.  WHY did they discontinue this camera?", "Date": "September 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "So good", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R38KR8WFZTTSOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item is a great Christmas present!", "Date": "December 2, 2001"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Combines an i-Zone camera with a earphone FM radio\nTakes instant pictures the size of a postage stamp\nFocus-free with built-in flash and simple loading\nSticky or nonsticky film available\nFlash automatically shuts off after each shot to conserve batteries", "Name": "Polaroid i-Zone Instant Camera w/ FM Radio", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4174AX5XY9L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00005NW1X"}}
