I got the dreaded \"this battery is not compatible with this device\" error.  A couple weeks later, I tried charging it using the official Nikon charger that came with the camera. Lo and behold - it now works perfectly. Go figure. I have no idea if this is a fluke, but if you're running into problems, see if using the official charger helps. (Note: in the interim, I had bought a different replacement battery which worked right out of the box - I don't know if that had any effect on getting this one to start working).", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "very nice", "Author": "Mihai Petre", "ReviewID": "R1HY20PTJZE3ZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't have any problems with it, perfect feet with the camera, very good price.

A charger came with the camera, but it doesn't work in the car. The backup battery and charger arrived quickly, within a day or so of being ordered. The charger that came with the battery charges the battery within an hour--about 50% faster than the charger that came with the camera. It's compact size makes it easy to carry in the gadget bag or in the glove box of the car. Works just like it's suppose to in the car.

This model is not only a fraction of the price of a Nikon battery and charger, but has a higher amperage and lasts significantly longer than the Nikon battery for my D3100. The charger is dual voltage and actually comes with an adaptor for european plugs. The only thing I would change about this package is to add a USB charging cable. The car charger cable is not that useful, but if I could plug in by usb to my computer or my phone's USB adapter to charge the battery, that would be amazing.

My camera kept giving me a message saying that this battery is not good for this camera. So I got in contact with Big Mike's Electronics and they got right back to me and had me get in contact with the manafacture. They had me send my battery back to them and they would send a new one in return.There was a point that I didn't hear back from the manufacture so I got in contact with Big Mike's again and again they inform me that the company was on vacation for a week. A long story short. I got my new battery and it's working fine. Just hope it last longer then five months. In short I just want to say that you can't go wrong with Big Mike's. They will stand by their product and make their customer very happy. If there was six stars then I would give it to them.

I've had used other screen covers for my cell phone, my Itouch, my IPad and all have came with top and bottom peel away film to protect the main film cover protector.  You peel the first part of the film then place it on the screen then place and remove air then when lined up and all air out you remove the top part of the film and you have a perfect screen protector.  This screen cover that came with this kit is a joke.  Its so cheap that it looks like a piece of plastic just put on for the heck of it.  When placing it with a piece of cardboard it came with, it kind of scratches the film.  When the film is placed it looks so bad I had to remove because the screen did not look clear when on.
