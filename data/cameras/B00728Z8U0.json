I am not an avid photography person, just a point and shoot that doesnt get into all the settings and things.  I must say this is the best camera i have owned ever!!  Picture quality and ease of operation are its primary pros.  I also wanted a camera that shot at least 720p video which this camera does pretty good.  The price was right and also came with a 16gb micro sd card.  I also wanted a camera that had a rechargeable li-ion battery instead of using AA's.  The battery life is superb also!!Yes it is small but i like that, the wall charger (very compact) and camera fit very nicely into a generic case which i got on fleabay for like $3.95 shipped!For basic point and shoot camera people you will not go wrong with this camera, i love mine!!", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Expected Good - Got Great!", "Author": "J. Sheldon Cooper \"Conspicuous Consumer\"", "ReviewID": "RBYPX42BCABCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must have a dozen digital cameras, from Nikon dSLRs costing thousands, and Point and Shoots from Sony, Leica, Nikon and Panasonic.The Lumix line was initially almost identical to Leica. Panasonic made the bodies, and Leitz provided the optics. Although you may not find a red dot on a similar camera, the lens is still provided by Leica. Professional photographers have always revered their Leica lenses as the zenith in optical quality.So to get fine optical quality in a $70 package is almost unheard of. There are several models in the Lumix line, all withj differing sizes and features. The FH6 is a top functioning camera in a small, slim package. Small enough to fit in a shirt pocket without a bulge.Startup is quick. Shutter lag negligible. Operation is intuitive.Along with great pictures, you can shoot crisp 720p video, and get 5x optical zoom.I knew from past experience that the Lumix FH6 would be good, but it has surpassed all expectations. It's hard to believe it costs less than $100. In a Lightning Deal, the price dropped to $69.95. If you buy one, you won't be disappointed. If I'm not shooting I very low light, or requiring 5fps burst speeds and sophisticated metering, the Nikon dSLR stays home and the FH6 slides into my shirt pocket.I am delighted with this purchase.", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Don M.

Its my birthday and I can not believe this.!!!!!!! I am SO disappointed. I will NEVER purchase another camera through Amazon again.So this camera gets 1 star because it came defective. It looks great tho and I'm sure it would be a great little camera if it had come in perfect working condition as I expected. This camera is not suppose to be refurbished it is suppose to brand new.
