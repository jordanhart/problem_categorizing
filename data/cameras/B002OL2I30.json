It is easy to install, but there are some things I don't like:* Although the picture is in color, it is a little washed out.* You can't have two video intercoms monitor the same camera (I have a 3 story house and would like to put video on the second and third floor).* It isn't real obvious that the button on the front is the doorbell. They give you a lot of doorbell sounds (Christmas, etc) but really you only need one sound.* The field of view is rather narrow and the mounting brackets don't really help when mounting since they are fixed.

The video is nowhere near as clear and crisp as the advertising photos - the colors are washed out and sepia-toned, and everyone's eyes look strangely dark and creepy, like Hollywood vampire versions of themselves. The picture is good enough to tell if you recognize the person at the door, but not good enough to describe a stranger to the police.The video duration is extremely short - about 40 seconds - after which, you have to press the button again; if you're watching to see what the stranger at the door does (and whether they leave when you won't answer the door), then you'll have to keep jabbing the video button over and over. This is problematic, as the buttons are big and cheap - they sort of \"pop\" up and down when you press them, so if the person at the door is listening for movement, they may hear you pushing the video button over and over. And since you only have about 50 feet of cord to work with, you'll probably end up mounting the intercom close enough to the door to be heard.The \"talk\" button, too, demonstrates a lack of craftsmanship; the button is 'sticky' and if you press the button at the bottom, then you can speak over the intercom, but if you press down on the top half of the button, the video immediately cuts out - I can only assume that the talk button is shorting the feed in some way.We were pretty disappointed, overall, with this video intercom. It's better than nothing, of course, but the advertising photos were much prettier and seemed to indicate a more sophisticated, better made system than what we received.~ Ana Mardoll", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Adequate", "Author": "Duane Nowell \"Abstract Artist\"", "ReviewID": "R5QPN1DGJUIJ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the look of the unit and the \"color\" monitor. The price is reasonable too. I do wish it came in other colors rather than just black.  But I can paint it so that's not a huge deal. There is one thing that is very buggy to me and that's why I only rated it with three stars.  When the chime is activated and I touch talk, I like the fact that I can talk freely without touching the button again, however I don't like the fact that when I touch \"unlock\" so the buzzer can unlock the door, that the camera turns off immediately.  The camera should stay on for at least 20 seconds so I can see my visitor is able to open the door okay. The way it is wired now cuts off my communication with the visitor.

Already tested it out, it's really really cool.I have no real comparisons to make with other video doorbell surveillance systems, but what I can say about this is that it definitely works for what it was intended.  Out of the box, it is incredibly easy to use and as quoted in the item description, will replace your old doorbell.  (It will require some handywork to mount it and draw the cords between the walls if you want it looking super nice)The video image is good... don't expect HD quality or anything, but it produces a very clear image where people can easily be distinguished.  The low light function works extremely well, and its automatic so you dont even have to adjust anything from the main controls.  The controls are relatively basic.  Three buttons to view, talk, and open the door.  There are chroma and brightness dials that you can adjust to your desired level, and a volume dial.  You can also pick from half a dozen tones that will ring when the outer button is pressed.  The only real qualms I have are the poor audio quality.  The rings are pretty atrocious and worse than ringtones on a cell phone.  The \"doorbell\" selection even sounds artificial and produced, but the quality of the actual speaking isn't too bad.  Expect the quality to be that of the quality of intercoms that have existed for the past 30 years.  No THX quality here.I'm a Film/Video/New Media artist so what I really like about this is that it looks like I'll be able to do some circuit bending and rewiring/soldering so I can use this in conjunction with some video art projects.  The parts are all there.  With the right tools, I can carry this along with me places while recording and displaying an image at the same time... but that's all self indulgent mumbo-jumbo.If you want a reliable, safe, and reasonably good quality item than this would be a good purchase for you.  I have no idea about the longevity of the device, but it seems pretty well made and sturdy.  For infrequent use, I imagine it would last a very long time.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simple video intercom system for the budget minded consumer", "Author": "Eagle Vision", "ReviewID": "R3CKOI21LRV6IM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Given the concerns of crime, I wanted an economical alternative for a video surveillance system.  This unit is a good option.WHAT COMES IN THE BOXVideo CameraMonitorWall Mounts and HardwareConnecting WiresCONSTRUCTIONConstructed of light plastic, I am not sure of its durability in the wet and humid months of Florida weather.  The buttons on the video monitor are well marked and large for any user.  On the side of the monitor, the user can set the doorbell to various sounds.  Doorbell sounds are annoying, at best, and the sound is reminiscent of the old Commodore 64 MIDI songs. Sound quality is good but slightly hollow for conversation.  Contrast and brightness can be adjusted.INSTALLATIONOnce you decide where to position the system.  Drilling in the holes and attaching the unit takes less than 25 minutes.  One of the negatives is trying to make the cable inconspicuous.  Affixing the cable along the contour of the door and the floorboard took another 30 to 45 minutes.QUALITYFor the price, the quality is good but not great.  I would have expected more rubberized components to keep the elements from damaging this over time.  However, for functionality, this system is very good and more than accomplishes the task.USEReplacing the doorbell button with the video monitor was easy after mounting the camera on the wall.  However, it is not going to be clear to visitors that the button should be pushed.  The \"Defender\" label is distracting and not aesthetically pleasing.  Picture quality is functional and decent for the purposes of identifying the visitors on the monitor.  However, there is a noticeable latency for the camera to adjust lighting conditions.  The night vision function is decent but the field of view is limited.One of the most useful functions is the ability to use the View button on the monitor.  This allows a quick scan of the entryway by the user inside, to \"Check things out\".OVERALLOverall, this is good system, especially for the price point.  It functions to the specifications but there are two things that I did not like:  The sound quality for the replacement doorbell and the lightweight construction.This system is worthy of consideration and you will have to decide upon the Pros and Cons for yourself, if you want to get this for your home.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wish I Had This Last Week", "Author": "Conspicuous Consumer", "ReviewID": "RURBZDMZ6FTCJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Someone entered my garage last week and stole technology from my car.

Mounting is also straightforward.  We had enough wire to mount the camera at the front of the shop and run the monitor into the adjacent home.Night vision rocks.

Some homes are more complicated; ours has several additional doorbells, all coming together at a common spot in the kitchen and powered by a transformer in the basement. The promotional materials for this color video intercom system make it clear that you can use your existing doorbell wiring so you can connect everything \"within minutes.\" That, however, is the last you'll hear about that as the installation/instruction manual does not include any information as to how to connect the device to your doorbell wiring.There are two units here: the first is a box with a button, speaker, and a camera. The box is hard-wired to a second unit which serves as a monitor. This second unit has an AC cord which plugs into the wall. These two units must be connected to one another with two wires. Note that the camera unit must be installed at typical doorbell height. The doorbell isn't lit  or labelled, and isn't the most obvious doorbell button in the world. If you hook up the unit high, noone would ever figure out that it serves as the doorbell. Down at doorbell level, of course, it is going to get wet in the rain and could easily be broken by those who would rather not be observed.The second unit, with the monitor, can be installed anywhere inside, but realize that if it goes on the wall in place of your current bell, it still needs to be plugged in. I've never seen an AC outlet right next to the usual spot for a doorbell. But maybe the typical voltage of a doorbell system will run this entire thing. I don't know...the manual never explains whether the AC cord is still necessary if you use existing wiring. But if you do use existing wiring, one of these units would potentially replace your front door bell, but then what about the back door? You still need your full original system so that it works. Or perhaps this unit can have the back door wiring attached to it. I don't know. That's not mentioned in the manual either. The other problem is that most interior doorbells are up pretty high, too high to easily access for monitor viewing and intercom activation, so you'll end up needing to do some interior rewiring in any case.Of course, you can leave your original doorbell system alone and simply install this as an additional unit. In that case, you need to run the wiring  from the exterior of your home to wherever you install the monitor box. The units themselves work reasonably well. The doorbell button outside activates electronic chimes in the monitor box - most of the time. You have to press firmly, beyond the \"click,\" to make the bell function. Loudness is reasonable and adjustable. The video camera functions well as does the IR lighting and the intercom. You can activate the unit manually if the visitor has used your old doorbell, but it activates automatically if the visitor uses the Gatekeeper's doorbell button.So ultimately this unit functions as advertised. But the manual leaves a great deal to be desired, particularly if you plan to use your existing wiring for the hookup. I was left with many questions even after accessing the company's website, which told me nothing more than the manual did.  I'd also look for a wireless system where the external unit draws its power from the existing doorbell transformer while wirelessly connecting and transmitting to an interior unit.", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not as good/easy as \"advertised\"", "Author": "Howie", "ReviewID": "R2LXZIUHXULUB1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My feelings/observations pretty much echo what others have said about this device:It looks and feels cheaply made.Doorbell sounds are \"cheesy\" and do not include a \"standard\" ding/dong.To the person at the door, this is not obviously a doorbell system.50' of connecting cable is not as much as you might think and can be somewhat limiting.  A maximum run of 100' is simply not good enough for some houses.  Were I to install this so I could monitor the front door from my basement, 100' would barely reach the desired location for the receiver/monitor.The description indicates you can use your existing doorbell wiring to connect everything \"within minutes.\"  Guess these guys have never been in an attic to connect to/troubleshoot doorbell wiring.  The worst part is that the installation/instruction \"manual\" does not include information as to how to connect the device to your doorbell wiring or whether an existing transformer will power everything.  It also does not say if your other door buttons and chimes can be left connected or not.  Additionally, if you want to use the monitor you must run the wire *somewhere* that you can access the system.  For most people this means surface wires or use of wall-trace unless you want to \"fish\" the wall to install the required wiring.  If I were to replace the current chimes with the monitor it would be at the ceiling.It works OK, but *just* OK.  Video is poor and washed out looking.  As another reviewer said so well: \"The picture is good enough to tell if you recognize the person at the door, but not good enough to describe a stranger to the police.\"  Once connected the video duration is just long enough to tell who's there but *not* enough to have any sort of conversation if needed.

This device is simple enough to install and is instantly ready to use with the flick of a switch.Besides the simple setup, this monitor has some other interesting features that make it useful. I really like the night vision option because it makes visible what would otherwise be difficult to make out. I like the sound- it is easy to tell exactly what is being said- and I like the loud, easily noticeable chime when someone rings the doorbell. The fifty- foot cable is also nice because it is long enough that I was able to place the viewing monitor in my bedroom with no problem.As for the cons, I can find a few. The video quality isn't the greatest- it is a little fuzzy, even though I can still tell who is on the screen. Then, there is the duration of the video- it displays for only about thirty to thirty- five seconds. After that, the screen goes blank and you have to keep pressing the video button to get it back. This latter feature is one I wish was different. Often, you will want to watch and listen to the person at the door, but because you have to remember to keep pressing the video button, you could easily miss something important.This is a basic intercom unit, hence the average quality overall. I know there are more sophisticated products on the market, but they all cost several times more than this, the Defender GK300- 7M2 intercom.

We have sidelights around our front door but wanted to be able to monitor the activity around the driveway and around our 3 cars.  This does that pretty effectively.  When the doorbell rings, we can not only check to see who is at the front door but also if there is any activity going on around our cars.Installation was relatively easy for my husband but he is very handy with assembly and installation of stuff around the house.  The picture is ok but not anything you would be able to use for the \"most wanted list\" if you needed it.  The range is sufficient for most neighborhoods -- it would not have worked well in our former house since the lots were so large but it works fine in neighborhoods where the houses are close together.Every so often we do get some interference and have to reset the system.  However, what device doesn't have that happen at this point?I can see many applications of this device -- I can see where it would also be useful for monitoring your kids in the back yard or activity in the back yard where intruders might be more likely to attempt an entrance.  For the price, it is a useful device with many applications depending on your neighborhood and the layout of the houses relative to each other.  I could see using a couple to provide full coverage around the entire house.  Fortunately, our neighborhood isn't so dangerous to where that is warranted.Overall, if you are wanting to discretely see what is going outside your house without having to press your nose up against the windows, I would recommend this device.

What does exist seems to be spread out over a very wide price range, from inexpensive to obscenely expensive, with little in between.After installing and using this for a bit, I can say this is a solid 4-star product.  Note:  I don't use an electric door strike, so I can't comment on that.Installation:As simple as can be.  It's a two-wire install, and they provide you with 50 feet of cabling.  If you need more, you can get it cheaply from any Home Depot or electrical supplies store, no need to contact the manufacturer (it's 14 gauge stranded two conductor wire).  The only problematic part is that you will need an electrical outlet near the viewing station to power it, which might not be the case for many who are replacing existing systems.  I am concerned about the longevity in the unit, since they didn't provide a weatherproof casing for the camera, so I decided to caulk it carefully around the unit to prevent water intrusion.Operation:One reason I couldn't rate this 5 stars is the viewing angle of the unit.  It's a narrow angle, and getting it to work properly on a short porch was a bit tough.  People standing off to the side might not be in the field of vision, negating the advantage of a video intercom.Using it is straightforward - the View button will let you view the camera, talk - well, you know.  There's a volume adjustment dial on the top to adjust both the bell and the audio volume, as well as brightness and color correction for the video.The video isn't the greatest - not really surprising given the price point.  If you've ever bought any security cameras, a good one with enough lines of resolution to provide a good image run more than half of the cost of this unit, if not more.  The video will still be good enough to view and recognize (or not recognize) faces, so it gets the job done.  The night vision is actually decent given the price point, since most of these units struggle with LED lit video.The selection of ringtones is a little chintzy, and they could've provided more (and better, IMO).  If you're going to be disappointed about replacing a nice chime belltone with a small speaker driven electronic ringtone, then think twice about replacing your current system.Overall:Install only took me 35 minutes, and I had to run new wiring.  The unit has worked up to expectations, with good but not great video in daylight or night.  The audio of the intercom is clear, and the operation is straightforward.  Provided longevity is good (>3 years) then I'll be very happy with the purchase.  Based on the market research I did, you can get better in terms of features (better video at least), but it'll cost you multiples of what this system runs.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "exactly what I wanted", "Author": "mindy", "ReviewID": "R9NEI1SLCIC7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It doesn't have a color screen like in the picture, but it is a great product.

So after many months of it sitting in the box (making a handy laptop stand) I decided to take it out and try it.  First, I tried connecting it directly to the doorbell with no luck.  Of course, my regular doorbell sounded but the system did not work.  Then I had to connect the 50ft of cable to get it to work.  Well, to make a long story short, it works.  The picture is decent enough for the price.  I disconnected it because I need to run the cable through the attic so it don't look so bad.  I have a brick house and I'm not drilling through brick.

The two units are as far as I can tell identical and I believe SVAT and Defender are one in the same company.The infrared LEDs do a good job of showing who is at the door when it is dark out as well.  We have the unit also control an electronic lock on the outside gate (this is an option with the unit).The audio quality is quite good both ways (to the individual at the remote unit and from the individual to the indoor unit.The indoor unit is smartly designed and should look good in most contemporary interiors.  We mounted ours on the wall (it can also just sit on a counter or shelf).As noted in its description it is a two wire system that can be used over your existing door bell wires.  In our case the system it replaced ran over USB cables so I ran new wires for the unit.

Having said that, the system works well and does exactly what it promises.Installation is fairly easy but will require drilling from the outside of the house to the inside so that the cord can get from the outdoor intercom to the video screen inside. There is plenty of cable included so you can probably run it to most first floor rooms in your house.There are a variety of doorbell rings (most are pretty annoying though and the inclusion of 'holiday' ones is kind of like wearing a big fuzzy Christmas sweater to the employee party.) Whatever floats your boat.There are multiple brackets for mounting at various angles to get the optimum video picture.There are also controls to adjust the color of the monitor although they can only take it to a moderate level.Once the doorbell is rung, the video screen turns on automatically and the sound intercom opens. It also turns off on its own.

My previous system had one button: push once for video and one way audio (listen only), press again for two way audio, press again for off.  This one requires pressing View for video, press Talk for two-way comm and talk again for off.- Horrible chimes.  Although it has 8 to chose from, they are all horrible.  This is one of those cases that just because you can, it doesn't mean you should.  Just because memory is cheap, a simple chime would have been better.  This seems to be a trend in Chinese and Taiwanese electronics.- Too thick and somewhat uninspired design.Bottom line: it does the job well.Quick note: if you do have any issues such as no-two way comm (after pressing the Talk button), noisy image or noisy comm, check the power supply.
