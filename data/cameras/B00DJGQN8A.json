{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not Good", "Author": "Molly B Merritt", "ReviewID": "R3ER38A2NYRC3S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Batteries don't last very long, but my biggest complaint is that 9 out of 10 pics are blurry.  At first I thought it was just my 5 year old daughter's fault, but after playing with it, changing settings etc...I found it hard to take a clear picture.  Another gripe is that every time you turn it on, it defaults to flash off...which makes no sense.  Why not flash auto?  It must be to preserve the already lame battery life?  My daughter has figured out how to toggle through the flash choices, but it gets old having to turn flash to on or auto every time the kid turns on the camera.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not as bad as the other reviews would lead you to think", "Author": "Leah Dondero", "ReviewID": "R1C3TM1DSVZXKA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I knew this camera would not be amazing obviously because it was only $30 dollars.  But I was buying it for a kid I babysit for and I knew that it wouldnt be used like an actual camera but more like a toy.  The color is cute, the buttons are functional and overall the camera wasnt that bad.  The one thing I have to say though is that the pictures it takes are of very poor quality.  They are kind of blurry and I highly doubt that the pix elation is around 10.  But it is functional and easy to use so I would give it 3.5 stars.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Where is the manual", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "RAC42Q4B4QBQ3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off I didn't purchase this camera from Amazon since I picked it up on sale and needed it really fast.
