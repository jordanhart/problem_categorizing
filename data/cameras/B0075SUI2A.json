Kemp", "ReviewID": "R2MLN92AFWFRB5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We've had this camera now for a few weeks and have come to really like it.  It is so thin and lightweight that it can easily be carried in a pocket, purse, or backpack.  Compared to the size of today's smartphones, this is actually smaller than some.The pictures are decent.  I find some of the interior pictures are a bit grainy, even with the flash.  The flash is plenty bright - so no issues there.  Switching to low light mode made all the difference.  This quick change off the menu function made for clear crisp pictures.Outdoor pictures are really outstanding.  Super clear and crisp.  Sometimes it has problems figuring out what to focus on.  However, when a face appears, it is really pretty good at identifying it and focusing on it.One of my favorite features is the rechargable lithium ion battery.  I hate having to deal with batteries.  However, it is a bit of an annoyance to get it charged as it requires the battery to be ejected from the camera and placed into a charger.The final reason why this inexpensive camera does not get a five star rating is the long time it takes between pictures.  Even on a fully charged battery, it takes on average 5 seconds for the camera to process each shot. If you are trying to take a bunch of group photos, this can seem like forever.Overall - I like this camera.  It is relatively inexpensive and takes great snapshots.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "A2300 - a good choice for a BASIC point & shoot that anyone can use", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R10FB9EAUUZ52G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this camera last week (purchased for a 12 year old niece's birthday). This camera, even though it's listed as red, is actually bright pink, but it's still subtle, it doesn't SCREAM bright pink. One thing that surprised me is that it's made of metal, not plastic like others in the under $100 price range. However, it is made in China, but I own other cameras that are in the $400+ range that were also made in China, so price isn't the determining factor on the manufacturing location.The Canon A2500 is a newer version of this camera, but if you do a comparison between the new A2500 and this one, the A2300, the specs are nearly identical in features. The only difference I could find was a very slight difference in overall size and a small difference in photos per battery charge even though they use the same battery.I decided, before gifting it to her, that I would make sure it was operational. (ETA: I gave this Canon to my niece, she loves it; as for myself, I wouldn't be thrilled with it as I want a camera with more manually-selected features.)This is a BASIC point and shoot camera, almost as basic as you will find nowadays. Which makes this a good choice for a person that's new to digital, young, old, anyone really.It's a small camera, easily fits in a pocket. The buttons are laid-out well so you don't hit a wrong button when you meant to push another. In this regard, much better than a couple of the Canon Elph models I tried previously. Build quality itself seems very good, but I do notice some noise in the zoom motor when playing back videos.Leave it on SmartAuto. Your photos will be good 99% of the time. But if you think you will get DSLR-quality images with this camera? Heck, no! You can't expect that with a camera this price. This camera is not that great in low light if you don't use the flash; when there's not enough light your photos will be grainy. It takes *very good* photos outdoors on a sunny day---but almost any camera will give you the same. I'd even go so far to say that some Smartphones will take better photos than this camera.No matter where you're shooting make sure you can hold steady while shooting-sure, this has digital image stabilization, but it's not as good as optical stabilization. And as far as I can tell, the Digital IS is only active when you choose the \"Digital IS\" setting by choosing Program-FuncSet-and right clicking the control wheel to Digital IS. This is disappointing that it's not available on all settings.The menus are typical Canon, and there is no dial like the more expensive cameras have.No optical viewfinder for those of you wanting to know. The LCD screen is average quality, not enough \"dots\", so when you take a photo and look at it on the camera's screen, it doesn't look nearly as good as when you upload it to your computer. I think I'm spoiled by my Sony cameras that have 921,000 dots, compared to this Canon that has only 230,000 dots.It's a little slow between shots, there is \"processing\" lag, especially when using the flash.Videos are \"ok\" with this camera, 720p is fine for those with an older computer. If you want a camera that has GREAT video I would suggest one of the Sony HX models like the HX10V which I own Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX10V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 16x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model), but you will pay a lot more for that camera - IMHO Sony cameras are hands-down the best at video. Back to this Canon: Yes, this Canon has audio with the video, but it's not stereo. You cannot optically zoom during the video, but you can do so before you first press the video button. If you DO use the zoom button after pushing the video button, it will be CRUMMY-looking digital zoom and you will hear noticeable zoom motor noise/clicking, at least on this camera I did.I wish it had FEWER megapixels than 16 MP. The sensor, being a 1/2.3 like most cheaper cameras, is too small. More megapixels are NOT better unless the sensor size is also larger to go along with it. This is part of the reason these cameras are crummy in low-light situations. Of course, you will pay a LOT more for a camera with a larger sensor, at least $300+. So this Canon will \"do\" - there's always some kind of sacrifice one makes when choosing a camera.One thing I really like about this is the use of a lithium ion battery as opposed to AA batteries, and it has a separate battery charger.  It also comes with Canon photo editing software, which I've used for years and I think is better than Picasa, although there are less editing features to choose.No internal memory at all, so make sure you buy an SDHC card if you don't already have one-otherwise you will be very disappointed when you go to use this camera the first time. I recommend a Class 10 card, especially if you plan on shooting videos.

It's easy to use, and takes very clear pictures with wonderful color rendition. It has reasonable resolution (clarity) in zoom mode, and performs well for action shots at sporting events. The auto mode settings are fine for most photos. Low light zoom shots (such as stage shows in dark auditoriums)may not be completely acceptable, but that's a tough condition for any camera and should NOT be considered a serious flaw. The movie mode works well, with good clarity and color. Bottom line: for everyday shapshots (condidering the performance, features, and price) you'll be happy with the A2300.

I refused to get rid of the big and bulky older model because it took such high quality pictures.  I didn't think any camera out there could top it but I was wrong.  This little camera packs a lot of bang for the buck.  My old camera didn't zoom in very closely but I can get great close ups with my new PowerShot.  I was looking for a less bulky smaller camera and I have to admit that when I pulled it out of the box my first reaction was that it's definitely smaller and I hope it takes good pics.  This camera is slightly larger than a deck of cards.  I took it to a festival and hoped and prayed that the pictures would take.  I downloaded them as soon as I got home.  The quality is superb!  It's even better than my old Olympus.  My husband was so impressed with my tiny camera that now he wants to get rid of his 10 year old model Cannon for one.  His words \"I can't believe that little bitty camera took those great shots.\"  Pics are not grainy, dim or distorted and true to colors.  I carry it everywhere with me now in my purse which is something I would not do with my bulky older model.  I love the color of the camera too. I ordered the red but it actually looks more pink to me which is what I was hoping for any way.  You will not be disappointed with this camera.  I am a point-and-shoot picture taker who doesn't want to mess with shutters, settings or anything else and this camera is absolutely perfect for me.  I highly recommend it for other point-and-shooters as well.  The price just can't be beat.  I should also mention that it was a toss up between purchasing a Canon and a much more expensive Nikon Coolpix.  I chose the Canon after reading the reviews here and I'm glad I did.  I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  Worth mentioning:  It was packaged very well and arrived quickly.  I ordered it two days before the festival, next day service, hoping that I might I get it in time.  I did and was able to load the memory card, charge the battery (another feature I love - rechargeable battery) and read the operator's manual before the next morning.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera is inexpensive for a reason", "Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "RXBHSHEDWNEXZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned several canon cameras, including SLR, DSLR, and several point-and-shoots, and this one is by far the most disappointing. Looking at the specs, I couldn't figure out why this camera was only a third of the price of other recently released Canon point-and-shoots, so I decided to try it out. I got it just in time for a trip to the Grand Canyon and Sedona, AZ... and now that I'm looking through my photos, I wish I would have just stuck with my DSLR. The colors are very dull on auto mode. We were at Red Rock National Park, and the rocks look brown in my photos, not red like they actually were... I tried the vivid color setting, hoping it would help... but that setting added TOO much color. It made a cactus look neon green and the red rocks look bright orange. And if you use the vivid color setting to take a photo of a person, they will look like tan mom. (i.e. orange)Besides the colors being either very dull or unnaturally bright, the photos from this camera are just not very crisp. The sky is pixelated/noisy in almost every image, and the photos of us are just kind of flat and blurry looking. I wish I could blame this on a lack of knowledge about cameras, but I can't... I use a high-end DSLR in manual mode every day for my job. (NOTE: I am not comparing this camera to a high-end DSLR. I just want people to understand that the disappointing quality of photos from this camera are not due to operator's error.)For less than a hundred bucks, it isn't terrible... but I was just hoping it would be as good as my Canon Powershot SD1200IS, which only cost fifty dollars more (3 years ago) and took amazing photos.It is a cute camera though (although the entire body is plastic)... so if you don't want to spend more than a hundred bucks, I think it's an okay deal.EDIT: Wow, a lot of commenters seem to be under the impression that I am comparing this camera to a high-end DSLR. I am absolutely not comparing the two. The only cameras I compared this to were previous models of Canon point and shoots that I owned and loved. This camera was cheaper than those, and I knew that when I bought it. But never having owned a bad Canon product, I expected it to take better photos than it actually does. I only purchased this camera because my beloved SD1200IS was stolen at my wedding and I needed a cheap replacement that I can carry around in my purse.

So I went to the store to look at buying a back-up camera that wouldn't cost much just in case my Nikon failed me during the trip. This camera was on sale for only $99 and had a good rating on the store website, so I bought it on the spot thinking it would just be a nice replacement if needed.However when I took it home and was playing with it, I was amazed at how much better this camera works than my Nikon. It is a lot better at adjusting to different settings automatically, and most pictures come out almost professional quality even without focusing and setting up the shot. It works really well in low light settings which I definitely can't say for the Nikon and which is something I was going to look for the next time I seriously went shopping for a new digital camera. Now that \"next time\" will be a long way off because I'm so satisfied with this one.Like most cameras, this one will work best if you stop to choose the right setting and focus your picture properly, but in most environments even a quick point and shoot will deliver a good quality picture. I also love that I was able to get it in bright blue, and I've even dropped it on stone but it still works perfectly!

Because I stupidly threw out the box when I received the camera, I can't return it to Amazon. It will be my beach camera, or something.

I could have bought a refurbished camera for $30 less: I feel even more ripped off now, even though their service was very helpful and responsive.If you must buy a Canon PowerShot, my recommendation is to buy one of the slightly higher end versions of the same camera; at least the A2400 IS which is only about ten dollars more.

I've noticed that any camera with a battery pack tends to last a lot longer on a charge than those that just take batteries.  The downside of having to recharge a battery pack is pretty obvious though as you can't just change the batteries on the fly if you want to, unless you've planned ahead and bought an extra battery and charged it up ahead of time as well.I suggest a higher quality SD card than the standard.  The pictures save a lot faster, though it's not terrible with a standard SD card either.  SD's are just so cheap though, that you might as well opt for a high speed card and not have to worry about missing out on a second shot during a critical moment where you're trying to capture something that you know is only going to last for seconds.  It's pretty frustrating when you're first shot looks like crap because you shook too much and you didn't get a chance to take a second shot because you're camera is busy saving!  I don't mean to be too harsh though because this camera doesn't take longer than the average to save an image.  It's just a drawback of digital cameras at this price point in general.The quality and clarity of the photos are amazing, except in low light situations.  In these situations it still does a lot better than any other camera at this price point.  If you're overly concerned about this, you're going to have to spend at the very least another $50 to go with a camera with a CMOS sensor.  The best cheap CMOS camera I've seen is the Panasonic Lumix DMC-SZ7 at $130.  I can't hold this Canon's low-light shortcomings against it though because as I said, it does better than anything else at this price point that I've seen.The only genuinely frustrating thing I've experienced so far is that the camera relies pretty heavily on you either knowing what you're doing, or on you pressing the \"auto\" button before snapping each shot.  The camera takes really nice pictures when the settings are right and it does a good job of selecting the right setting for you if you hit the \"auto\" button before each picture, but taking a picture on the wrong setting can result in some gruesome photos.Overall I don't know that there's anything better on the market at this price point right now.

My wifes old 4 mp camera worked way better than the a2300 with 14 mp. (My iPhone 3G 2mp camera is also better!) At this point we had not yet sent back the Amazon a2300 camera so we decided to give it a shot. The Amazon a2300 worked better than the one we got from walmart, but it had the same problem. The cannon a2300 dose not focus well. Photos are sub standard, no matter what setting you use.

It was on sale and there were so many positive reviews, and I know Canon is supposed to make good cameras, so I decided to give it a shot.Boy was I disappointed. I'm actually shocked this camera has good reviews at all. Either people have never had a decent point and click camera so they don't know what a good one really is, or I have a dud.You can only change the iso speed in the Program mode. All other pre-programmed modes have auto iso, and sometimes it takes 3 seconds or more for it take the frigging picture. That doesn't work well when your subject is a child. And you can't use the image stabilization in the Program mode. I've been tinkering with it for days now, using every combination of settings I can, and yet my 3 yr old is just a blur because the Digital IS mode doesn't take pictures quickly or clearly enough. I would not recommend this camera for action shots... which excludes most children. Well, it can capture my 3 month old pretty well, but that's mostly because he's not very mobile, but he will be and then he, too, will be just a blur.) Also, the image size in Digital IS mode is pre-set and you can't change it, so the pics are only 1600x1200 or thereabouts.The macro function is decent, though not as sharp as I'm used to. I frequently take pictures of my handmade products to sell online, so the macro is a must for detail shots. This camera would be decent enough for this purpose to get by. But there are much better ones available that also take action shots.The only way I've been able to take \"good\" pictures with this camera is with the option of programming all the settings myself, and even then they weren't anything special and not nearly sharp enough to be considered quality. All other options are sub-par and quite frankly, useless. (And really, fisheye? Does anyone actually use that?) Even the auto function comes out fuzzy, even in still pictures.The only plus about this camera is the one-push video recording. The videos themselves aren't the greatest, but they'd do.It may fit other people's needs, but not mine. It will be returned and I'll probably get another Lumix, because I know they work well.Update - I've gone through the pictures I've taken with this camera, and you can reduce the fuzziness of the pictures if you shrink them - I took mine down to 2000x1500 - but even then they still look a little \"soft\". So if you don't care about having quality large pictures, then I'm sure it will be fine.

This camera CAN be so modified.I discovered that many Canon PowerShot cameras, including this one, can have their capabilities extended by using free software called CHDK (Canon Hack Development Kit). I received my PowerShot A2300 yesterday and in one day have been able to install and successfully use CHDK on this machine. The native A2300 firmware doesn't include an \"intervalometer\" feature (the ability to have the camera continually shoot pictures every n seconds over a given amount of time, something useful for astronomical movement). I've verified that an included intervalometer script with CHDK does exactly what I want. I can also now specify that the pictures are stored in RAW format and not compressed automatically to jpeg. Finally, you can set this up for bracketing, or taking a series of pictures with automatically changed ISO, shutter speed, and aperture.A very sturdy and nice point and shoot from Canon has just become one of my best buys ever.

I received it and immediately took it to Africa on a business trip, thinking it would be a great way to test it before giving it to my son. I regretted not bringing my own SD850, because I did not get a single good picture (out of 160 taken), never mind a \"great\" photo. No matter how many settings I tweaked--settings that were hard to find as they are layed deep in menus--the results were dismal.And worse--and this is critically important--if you hand your camera to a stranger to take your photo for you, they should be able to just press the button. With this camera, the stranger-taken photos were so bad they immediately went in the trash--every one of them.Immediately upon my return to the US, I returned this camera.Also, as an aside, Canon has a fatal flaw with their cameras: All cameras use the same hard-coded numbering system. So if I have three cameras, I am forced to rename every photo, or I will end up with the same filename--but different pictures. I don't mind renaming--and I do it anyway, but when my wife's and my camera reached the same number sequence in the same month, I could not even download them into the same month's folder.

I think ordinarily it sells for around $90. I would probably been a little more reticent to buy at that price point.The battery lasts a long time...but when it is kaput, it is kaput all of a sudden. The Battery Display on the LCD screen shows Full, then all of a sudden it tells you the battery is exhausted. This causes me to consider purchasing a 2nd battery, so as to not be out shooting & have my plans cut short by an unexpected dead battery. I will probably search Amazon or eBay for that: typically, buying a replacement battery from the manufacturer is expensive.The PowerShot A2300 takes great snapshots.The LCD Display is adequate; you can turn off all of the displayed info and just concentrate on the subject if you choose.I just took a shot yesterday of an old rooftop neon sign, on a 10 story building, blocks away. I had it at full zoom, 20x, and the Auto-Focus got me a shot that was very clear & sharp. No blur. I was impressed.The included PC software (presumably Mac, too, but you better check...) is unimpressive. Not that I had difficulties with it or anything. It just doesn't do anything that my preexisting image software does not already accomplish. I suspect that had I owned no image manipulation software already, and had only to rely upon the included Canon software, I would be looking for something better (ie. Photoshop, PaintShop Pro or Gimp) rather quickly.I wish the camera's onboard software did a little more, such as offer me the ability to take black & white shots, sepia tone, filtering. The kind of thing offered on the cameras on smartphones. I like using that stuff. The absence of that filtering stuff is the reason I gave only 4 stars. You might say, \"The photos look great, which is what it is supposed to do. Why judge it for what it lacks in filtering abilities?\" My answer to that is, \"If the onboard digital filtering is available on my cheap Samsung Android phone, or even the older LG slide-out-keyboard phone (only 1 Mpx!) I had before it, then it would have been simple for Canon to have offered similar functionality built into this PowerShot. They did not.\" Thus, 4 stars.This camera, however, does take 5-star, 16 mega-pixel, color snapshots.If you can get this camera for under $65, snap it up immediately.

Just Don't Forget To Smile ;)", "Author": "Arthur Senior \"Small Engine Mechanic\"", "ReviewID": "R3EV526CGDBQ1H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used cheap digital camera's in the past and none of them were any good. I am an amateur photographer and I enjoy taking snapshots of all kinds of things, especially nature. I bought this hoping I would finally have a quality camera at my disposal, that would allow me to take amazing pictures. However, I didn't have enough money to afford those expensive DSLR cameras, so this was going to have to do.Unlike cheap cameras that wont focus, or don't even have macro, this one can. Its pretty much an all around point and shoot camera, and while it allows you to set manual options for the scene, using the auto mode you don't have to. The power button is on the top, press it once, it comes on, and your ready to take pictures right away. You have to hold the shutter button down half way for a few seconds for the camera to auto focus and to adjust lighting, then press it down all the way to take the shot.I like the fact that this camera has a flash, and its so smart that it knows just how much light to give at any given time. Most of the time the flash will go off when indoors or when there is no light, such as night time. But I took some pics inside where all I had was one window open bringing in light, and the camera chose not to use the flash, its so smart. You can also manually adjust the shutter speed of the camera, but I prefer to keep it all on auto, as that takes away a lot of the guess work for beginners.The camera has a macro mode function as well, this allows you to get super close to an object and get it in focus instead of a blurry picture. The largest use I have for macro is taking close ups of flowers, but can be used for electronic buffs who want to take pics of circuit boards, or for the cute types who take close up pics of their animals faces. I wanted to take a few pics of myself but I had no one to hold the camera. And while I can take pics of my own face by holding the camera out, its so limited to what you can do.This camera also has a timer function, you can use a preset 2 second, or 10 second delay. And if you need more time then that, you can set a custom timer function such as 20 seconds or 30 seconds. I was able to go a distance away from the camera and make a pose and the timer function worked flawlessly. I was very happy with the shots I got. You can also set the timer function to take multiple shots as well, not just one.This camera also has a zoom function, it has a 5x optical zoom and has 15x digital. In most cases 5x zoom is all that you will need, I was able to take beautiful shots from a distance using the optical zoom. Sometimes though if your taking pics of a bird far away, or a mountain that is a distance away, you can add a little digital zoom to. Keep in mind though, digital zoom does degrade picture quality so only use it if you have to.I noticed something important about this camera, I feel the need to mention. Its a 16MP camera. However, if you don't have enough light on the subject, it seems to take 9MP shots. For example, indoor shots might end up being 9MP, where as outside in full sunlight, you will get the full 16MP. The camera automatically chooses the size of the pic based on the amount of light you have so make sure you have a lot if you want 16MP.This camera also has the ability to take video, 720P HD to be specific. Unlike taking pictures where you have the flash for low light, the flash can not be used while taking video. This means you need a lot of light, otherwise your video will turn out grainy. I find shooting outdoors best and the quality of video is on par with my 720P Creative Vado pocket cam. Its not 1080P though, but I didn't get it for taking video.When you put the camera in play mode, you can be able to display the pics or video you took and navigate them by using the left and right buttons, and using the middle button to select them. You can also zoom in on the pics you took using the zoom wheel and you can also delete the pics or video you took from the camera as well. When your ready to upload them, just plug the camera into an available USB port using the included cable, the computer detects your camera and you can download the pics right away.The camera unfortunately does not come with an SD card, which is needed for taking a lot of pics or video. I bought a 16GB SD card and I have never filled it up yet. But to give you an idea on battery life, I was able to take 250 pics, without flash, before the lithium battery died, and it only took a few hours to charge it back up with the included charger. If you were to use flash for every picture, I would say you could take half that many.I've used digital cameras long enough to know about how quickly you can drain batteries. So I bought 2 more battery packs with a second charger, so I would always have a fresh battery at the ready. I also bought a protective case for the camera as well as a mini tripod for small stuff. On the bottom of the camera is a compartment door that you slide out to the right side of the unit, which opens to reveal the battery and SD card. So its pretty easy to change out.One of the things that I think is cool is how when you turn the camera on, the lens pops out, and then when you turn the camera off, the lens retracts in and a shutter covers the lens to protect it against scratches or dirt, very nice Canon! The camera is also small, fits in the palm of your hand, and can fit into a standard dress shirt pocket. I have uploaded some pics that I have taken with this camera. I am very happy with it and I highly recommend it! 5-STARS", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R32GG0IE462PKO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "BASIC CAMERA, WOULD PROBABLY BE GOOD FOR A FIRST TIME USER, WILL LET MY KIDS USE, OK FOR PRICE, CUTE COLOR", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "great pictures but takes time to process..", "Author": "R.S", "ReviewID": "R2RVKAO1RWRUOW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is very nice, its small and light also the battery last longer than expected.

Weaver", "ReviewID": "R113AQOCKKOMIB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought this camera as a gift for my daughter's 7th birthday because she's not getting a cell phone any time soon, cameras designed for kids don't take very good pictures, and we just couldn't see letting her handle the DSLR on a regular basis. As a starter camera, this was great. It has very few settings and is quite easy to figure out. My daughter was able to take some really good pictures on a recent family vacation.The camera isn't great, though. While my daughter's pictures (of landscapes, of monuments, of people posing, of herself) were generally clear and focused, I found that when I used the camera to try to capture her and her 2-year-old brother, I often got blurred images or a longer than desired delay between pictures. The camera doesn't allow for a lot of movement by your subjects. And, though you can set it to take several continuous shots and change shooting modes, I generally don't have time to do that when we're in the moment. I just want to be able to grab and shoot. For this, I still prefer my DSLR (which is so old it has a much lower megapixel count, but of such superior quality that it still takes better pictures).Another slight drawback to this camera is that it does not have a viewfinder through which to frame your picture, so you're entirely dependent on the LCD screen which is difficult to see in some lighting (and most especially on gorgeous, sunny days!). I know this is what a lot of people are used to with their digital cameras and phones these days, but I still like to be able to frame my photos the old fashioned way while I'm shooting.One other thing I should mention is battery life. This camera comes with a proprietary battery and charger for said battery. You can't simply replace it with double or triple As. I found the battery life to be relatively short if you're on vacation. We found that on a single day of sight-seeing, we could wear the fully charged battery down completely if we weren't conservative in our use. As there is a slightly slow startup with the camera, this meant that we lost a few good pictures to battery conservation. On a day-to-day basis, however, the battery life is no issue at all (and charging is pretty darn quick).As I said, we looked at this as a beginner camera for a young child. The faults I found with the camera were things with which she had absolutely no issue. So I'd still recommend this camera for someone new to digital photography. It's simple and functional and is going to be ready to go as soon as you.

My wife took a look at it and said that she was going to use it on her next trip coming up in August.  Normally, she keeps away from any photo gear, but found this camera not to be so challenging and was willing to use it.As for myself, I was very impressed with the viewing screen which was very sharp and clear.  Colors seemed more natural and over all quality was excellent.  I will have to see how this holds up as we get to use it more and I have more photos to compare with my Nikon D5100 and Sony Nex-5N images.  But for less than $60, this is an impressive camera.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Got a great deal on this great camera....", "Author": "Dave P", "ReviewID": "R1IC3WJVPPV5WE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was purchased as a replacement for an older Canon C643, that I've had for a long time.

I am a semi-pro photographer, so it's tough for me to review a consumer camera, but I'll do my best! I would like to point out that this camera seems to change price daily here on Amazon. We spent less than eighty dollars on it, and that's really about all I would spend on a camera of this quality. The hundred+ bucks it sometimes jumps to makes i not totally worth it, in my opinion. Just something to watch out for.BUILDThis camera is TINY, and not just coming from someone that lugs around fast zoom lenses for DSLRs! It can easily fit into any pocket which will definitely be a positive for many people looking for a small camera. This also means that you should probably purchase a case to keep this safe, and though I won't be testing, I assume that the small and light build won't stand up to dropping or other abuses. Still, it's not badly built, and overall has a very nice feel to it! The buttons all give a satisfactory response when pressed. The screen is mostly clear and sharp, a pleasant surprise.IMAGE QUALITYOverall, with the right conditions this camera is absolutely capable of taking some very decent pictures. Shooting with natural light is always preferable anyway, but this camera will always work best outside or near a decent source of light. In darker conditions, or when zoomed in, image quality is greatly affected with noticeable digital noise in both of these situations (see cons below). Again, not unexpected, but something that should be pointed out. Still, for family snapshots and impromptu pics of the dog/cat, it should be satisfactory for most casual users.MINOR ANNOYANCESThe first little thing that is a little bit irksome, is that the camera only has a general \"mute\" setting. While this will mute any system sounds (something I prefer to do), it will also not allow you to play any audio associated with a video you have recorded, forcing you to unmute every time you want to watch a video. I have also found that the battery release mechanism can be a bit fiddly - again not a huge deal but something to be aware of.CONSOne real disappointment is the low-light performance of this camera, which is pretty rough even for this price category. Without the flash, normal indoor lighting results in grainy images, full of digital noise. Again, I'm trying not to be too nitpicky, but the low-light quality of this camera is comparable to my iPhone 4, which has a much smaller sensor. I have used several other sub-$100 cameras recently, and I have to be honest and say that the low-light/zoom performance of this camera is at the bottom of the list.HD VIDEOI was pretty pleased with the quality of the HD video (720p) setting of this camera. Though it of course suffers from the same caveats as still images, it really performs VERY well overall. As a plus you can use this as a webcam with the right software installed, and it makes for very nice video chatting. I have added a link to a video in the comments of this review that displays the video quality of this camera (not my video, found on YT). Though it suffers from focus issues when zoomed in, overall it does pretty well.OVERALLFor a small and inexpensive camera, the powershot is capable of taking some nice pictures. There are several caveats, but I suspect that people spending less than eighty bucks on a camera really won't mind too much. My elderly relative really enjoys the ease of use and image quality, so that should be a good gauge on how it fairs overall.

I've been tinkering with it for days now, using every combination of settings I can, and yet my 3 yr old is just a blur because the Digital IS mode doesn't take pictures quickly or clearly enough. I would not recommend this camera for action shots... which excludes most children. Well, it can capture my 3 month old pretty well, but that's mostly because he's not very mobile, but he will be and then he, too, will be just a blur.) Also, the image size in Digital IS mode is pre-set and you can't change it, so the pics are only 1600x1200 or thereabouts.The macro function is decent, though not as sharp as I'm used to. I frequently take pictures of my handmade products to sell online, so the macro is a must for detail shots. This camera would be decent enough for this purpose to get by. But there are much better ones available that also take action shots.The only way I've been able to take \"good\" pictures with this camera is with the option of programming all the settings myself, and even then they weren't anything special and not nearly sharp enough to be considered quality. All other options are sub-par and quite frankly, useless. (And really, fisheye? Does anyone actually use that?) Even the auto function comes out fuzzy, even in still pictures.The only plus about this camera is the one-push video recording. The videos themselves aren't the greatest, but they'd do.It may fit other people's needs, but not mine. It will be returned and I'll probably get another Lumix, because I know they work well.Update - I've gone through the pictures I've taken with this camera, and you can reduce the fuzziness of the pictures if you shrink them - I took mine down to 2000x1500 - but even then they still look a little \"soft\". So if you don't care about having quality large pictures, then I'm sure it will be fine. Though it's still not good for action shots.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Bad", "Author": "Kayako", "ReviewID": "R2VQ043ECAK4UN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is worse then crap.

It came on time and nicely packaged. The accompanying brochure had very limited information about the basics of the camera. For everything else, one has to read the pdf document provided in the CD. Despite having used it for more than 3 days now I cannot say I understand all its different functions and parameters - bare in mind I am a fairly experienced photographer who has used numerous cameras in the past (SLRs as well as point & shoot). Its slow and rather complicated if one tries to move away from the AUTO feature. The good things about it are its small size, its low weight and that's about it!

You can also tweak the settings to your liking but their isn't much to mess with. Just general stuff.There's no way to manually focus the camera nor does it have auto-focus while filming. Light pressure to the picture taking button (noob talk :p) will make the lens focus before taking the picture of filming. Hard pressure will take a picture/film without re-focusing.You can zoom in and out and also digitally zoom but only when zoomed in all the way first.Good camera for it's price, but don't expect $500 quality on this.

I used to have Sony W530, which was 14.1 mega pixel. It is a lot better and has a lot more functions that this one. Well, with $73 what I can expect more.

Here's my evaluation. It is really handy and it takes well-exposed pictures. The rechargeable battery lasts a reasonable time. The picture quality has limitations. For posting the photos on the web, it is adequate. However, any significant amount of enlargement will reveal some grainyness, especially in the sky. However, for a handy camera under $100, it is satisfactory. I have other cameras for \"serious\" photography. It's hard to believe that the sensor has a 16 MP resolution, when you can see the noise so clearly.I have not used the video recording function, so I cannot comment on that, but I suspect it's probably so-so, too.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's okay", "Author": "Mary DeFilio", "ReviewID": "R1U52LYSC8MZ49", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got this for a stocking stuffer over Christmas but returned it as it wasn't as impressive as I thought.

What did I get myself into? Of course, I knew my location and I knew this was a factor, but I was still uneasy. However, I realized after a few snaps (okay a lot, I couldn't help myself) the camera just appears to be grainy, the photos come out so clear and nice! It's weird, but I don't mind it. The photos get even better in more/better light, and even better when taken outdoors. The close up pictures are astounding, I couldn't believe the quality. I was even happier because that's what I wanted. The zoom is great, but with 5x, you can't expect to zoom in on the little things. I bought this camera for $80 and let me just say, it was a steal. No device is perfect, and you can't expect a high quality professional camera for this low price. However, you can expect very nice quality, an easy use, and durable design!

It performs very well for my needs, taking close up pictures of plush dolls I've made before sending them to the buyer. But I also like to carry it around with me to take pictures of other things, and today it bumped against something and the thin metal around the lens dented, preventing the shutter covering the lens from opening and closing. The bump wasn't that hard and shouldn't have been enough to cause any damage. I managed to pop the metal back out enough with a needle for the shutter to work again, but this is the first time I've seen a camera with such thin metal around the lens.In short this is a great camera for quick and easy pictures, but make sure you carry it in a very sturdy case.

He couldn't put it down, he was like a child with a new toy. This was the second digital camera he owned, the first being a Kodak EasyShare M883 8MP(ASIN: B0011FMZY2).Now off the bat the first thing I notice after opening the box is the build quality. Not a good first impression. Unlike the Kodak, the canon is all plastic and has a hollow feel about it. I know most digital cameras wouldn't do well in a drop test but this felt like it wouldn't stand as good a chance as others. Even the flap that opens to insert the battery feels a lot more flimsy than that of the Kodak. I recommend when charging the camera it would be better if you charged it with a computer via the data cable rather than using the external battery charger. Limit the number of times you open the flap.Now the good news. It has 16MP which means the quality of the pictures are really good. The interface is also very easy to use. After a few times the interface would become second nature to you. I've read some reviewers saying it takes to long to snap a picture. I TOTALLY disagree. Snapping pictures are instant with no delays at all.So to sum it up: Easy camera to use with great quality pictures but must be handled with care as one fall could be the end of it. Use the strap provided ALL the time.Update 2/7/13-So after using the camera for a while I've notice 2 things. First the battery doesnt last very long. It would get you through almost an entire day but that's the most you can hope to get out of it before it needs to charge again. Second, i assumed the camera could've been charged by hooking it up to a computer. But this isnt the case. Either it charges REALLY slow or not at all. In the end i had to use the battery charger. Because of these reasons this product is gonna have to lose a star", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot", "Author": "Lois", "ReviewID": "R1RNQGBBDTDUDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A small but powerful digital camera.

Upon receiving the camera, I immediately considered returning it, as it felt cheaply made and like plastic rather than metal. However, I tested it out in the backyard in sunlight, filming my dogs. I also used it attempting to photograph our newborn kittens underneath my bed, in the dark. When viewing the pictures on my computer, they higher quality than on the review screen of the camera itself. I also did not like the software that accompanied the camera. It may be more suitable on a PC. I own a MacBook Pro, so I already have iPhoto and Preview. These work much better for my needs and allow for more editing and revising. But, as stated previously, the software may be more useful on a PC, but I do not like its Windows Photo Gallery. Overall, I do like the camera. PRO'S: it is lightweight (now that I am used to it), it takes clearer pictures due to higher mega-pixels, it is fairly straightforward in its operation, and it has many options for lighting, size of pic, etc. CONS: it does not have lighting for video (big con for me), changing modes from auto to portrait etc. is more difficult than my others, it has fewer options than my older Canon. The 4 star rating is based on my PRO'S and CON'S . I cannot say how well this particular camera compares with ones it its category (same pricing, options, mega pixels, etc.) but its price is comparable to its performance.

Looks cool, real small, real light. Canon and the other reviews says its a tough little camera. Awesome. This is the kicker, especially for you deployed folks out there: ALL Canon products require an off-board charger. Yep. NONE of the Canon products can be charged via USB. Email Canon yourself if you don't believe me. Go ahead, I'll wait...See? Toldja. The software was fast to install, the device drivers were stored either in Windows 7 or in the camera itself, which is awesome. The USB cable is a USB-B connection, so it's compatible with MP3 players, external HDDs, some American cell phones...a vast array of different devices those of us who make a living on the move might carry.If I were on the fence of buying this cool little camera or some other, I'd pick the other one. That other manufacturer was probably smart enough to design the power circuits to charge the battery on-board the camera.EDIT: In just about 2 months of owning and possessing this camera in Afghanistan, the dust has already wreaked havoc upon the lens' extend/retract mechanism. The lens assembly will click and whir quite noticeably and may not even extend/retract at all. I have, of course, used canned air and acid brushes (little black soft nylon bristles with an aluminum body) to clean the dirt and dust from the lens at least once every 2-3 days and I'm still in this position. My next move will be to disassemble the camera and try to clean it out from the inside. I will edit again with those results.EDIT: I did, indeed, take the camera apart. The ribbon cable tore that connects the LCD to the rest of the system, but that's not the manufacturer's fault. That level of disassembly is above the consumer level. While I had the system open, I noticed that the sand, dirt, and dust from Afghanistan had severely eaten away at the lens drive gear and all of the lens cam paths. The receptor inside the lens assembly (the part that actually captures the image) was dirty beyond any cleaning I had available in my work area. Q-Tips and technical-grade isopropyl alcohol simply were not enough. If requested, I can provide pictures of the disassembled item. In short, if you're going to be using it in high-particulate environs, don't buy this camera.

I tried it on the highest resolution (L) and the images are blurred even with the minimum zoom. I compared it to a 5MP iPhone to find the latter having better resolution.
