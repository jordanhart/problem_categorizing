It protects my Sony A77 prefectly.  Still have room for extra Batteries and filters.  Excellent value.  Price is really good and the pouch well made. Perfect for protection for the camera between picture locations and easily opened when it comes time to start using the camera.

I just recently bought my first DSLR, a Nikon D3200. After using an old lunch box to hold my camera body and lens for about a week of traveling and photographing at various locations I realized it probably was time to invest in a nice case. I've had this case for a little while now and it fits my Nikon snug as a rug, lens on and off. The strap is very comfortable, and adjustable, there's plenty of pockets for goodies (such as filters, spare batteries, a charger, flash drives, SD cards, lens cloths, and whatever else you might want to bring along with you.) That being said, it is a *very* snug fit and I wouldn't recommend stuffing lots of accessories into it because of that. This case represents an exceptional bargain. I paid around $20 for mine, and with Amazon Prime I got it in two days. It fits everything I need it to and more! Very lightweight but super durable! If you're unsure of what case to buy as a beginner to DSLRs, this is one you won't want to miss.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "As promised", "Author": "Rick Porter", "ReviewID": "R1EA4JS5C93CB1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Took about a week to arrive. The strap has a nice pad for those who walk a lot with it over their shoulder. Fit my Nikon D5300 with 18 - 140 lens prefect. The pockets have more than big enough to extra SD memory cards, 2 extra batteries and an extra filter or two. It's light weight and well padded. I'll be using it for a backpacking trip across the bottom of the Grand Canyon in two weeks. The only negative thing so far is the strap was not set up to be removed without doing some damage to it or the metal ring that holds it to the case (minus one star). I was going to exchange a soft elastic strap for the hike. But I decided to go with the padded strap it came with and see how it works over the 38 miles of trail.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect Size", "Author": "AgateShadow", "ReviewID": "R1Q0C5CCZAGKMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this for my camera, the camera fits perfectly inside, no tightness, it is a Fuji Film S4800 camera.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Handy!", "Author": "new customer", "ReviewID": "R1UW3TQ182SFOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This bag is great.
