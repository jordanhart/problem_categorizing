{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice camera, great quality and sound works too...", "Author": "Charles B. Firth \"Chuck\"", "ReviewID": "R2GCJZNMSJD5JS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for watching my bird feeders from indoors. I have a four channel Zmodo security system which I like very much (for the price). I wanted to add a camera with sound for watching my bird feeders from my office desk which I cannot see via a window. I also wanted to hear the little critters. This camera is great for that. I hooked it up to a two channel sequential video switch, which effectively allows me to have five cameras on the four channel system. When I am away from the office I can have it automatically switch back and forth between office interior and the feeders. When at my desk, I switch it to just watch the bird feeders. Sometimes a squirrel will hang over the camera and try to launch itself onto the feeders, very fun. Of course with the Zmodo DVR I can see the entire system from my iPhone or computer wherever I am. Note: this camera is HUGE, it is not the typical size security camera. Also, the infrared LEDs allow EXTREME night vision. This is not essential for bird watching, but man it illuminates a huge area and you cannot see those led lights at all from outside. On the monitor it looks like you are running a flood light outside! This is not an HD camera but it has great daytime color and a sharper picture than the cameras which come with the inexpensive Zmodo system I have.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Zmodo CM s23349sv ad security camera", "Author": "Clayton E. Lake", "ReviewID": "R3HSHVGSWV1V53", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The variable Lens is great and easy to change.  The color and sound are good.  It is easy to install.  I would have rated it a 5 star, except for the IR mode.  It has a bright spot in the middle of the image, making that part of the image unusable.  Everything else is outstanding.  I would be interested if anyone else has this problem with the IR mode.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Zmodo CM-S23349SV-AD Security Surveillance Outdoor Vari-Focal Video Audio Camera", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R1CGO8EDI3UQHB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is pretty large for a bullet camera. But very strong housing (all metal). i've had it for 4+ months now, and it's been mounted outdoor on my roof pointed towards my backyard. It's been rained on, pooped on by birds and bugs, but so far, it has survived and i have not had any issues with it. This camera is great because it covers a wide area, meaning i could see from one side of my backyard to the other side (from left to right). However, i cannot pick up any audio with this camera. i've tried getting help from Zmodo tech-support but have not get a clear answer on why i can't get audio. And also, the night vision is okay at night time. i would rate the night vision with a 3 stars because it's not as clear as expected. But overall, great camera!", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "What A Buy", "Author": "Terry L.
