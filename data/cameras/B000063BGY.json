What an amazing deal! This camera is easy to use, has tons of great features (the dock that keeps your battery charged is a must, as is a 128mb card) and takes beautiful pictures. I waited to write my review until I got some hard copies back from the kodak print center and they look even better than my 35mm. I can honestly say that I will never need more camera than this. I use it for the kids sporting events and have tried it indoors and out. There simply isn't a reason not to go with this camera. Some of the 2 megapixel cameras are going for the same price.

I decided to buy the DX4900.  This is a great camera that takes excellent pictures.  When the pictures are printed by a photo lab, it looks like a picture from a film camera.  Most people will not be able to distinguish between the digital print and the film one.  The camera is made of plastic and is very light.  For some, it may feel a little cheap but the pictures definitely makes up for it.  I would also recommend a 128 mb card that will take about 100 photos at 4MP.  The included 16 mb card will only hold about 12 photos.  This is my second digital camera and I am very pleased with it.  I highly recommend this camera.

It's basically a point and shoot camera that makes digital photography accessible even to non-techies.FEATURES:Digital Camera:  At it's highest resolution of 2272 X 1704 it can hold about 20 pictures or so.  The easy to review LCD screen gives you instant feedback on your pictures and helps you decide on the spot whether or not they are worth keeping.  You can add on another memory card to give you even more flexibility with the number of shots you can take.  Plus, at a whopping 4.0 megapixels, this camera is at the high-end of printing and picture resolution in the digi-cam market.  For quality pictures you'll want to stick to cameras at 3.0 megapixels or up, definitely no less than 2.0 megapixels.Easily Works With Your PC:The DX4900 connects easily with your PC and comes with transfer software so you can easily download, edit and e-mail your pictures and videos, thus allowing you to share your pictures easier with family and friends.NOTE:One of the most frustrating aspects about digi-cams are the \"short-lives\" of the batteries that come with them.  Batteries tend to die out quickly, especially if you use the LCD monitor on the camera (which is one of the best things about digi-cams).  Based on other reviews it seems that a lot of users have complained about the \"power issues\" with the DX series of cams (and other digi-cams as well).  You'll definitely want to invest in the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock II which comes with rechargeable batteries and helps make the picture transfer process easier.My investment in the camera dock has helped keep my cameras (I own two) in tip-top working condition.  Trust me, if you plan to get good use of out your camera, invest in the camera dock and NI-MH rechargeable batteries.  It will save you a lot of frustration when your camera does not die out on you at an inopportune moment.THE VERDICT:Overall, if you need a nice, easy to use camera to record your everday (and not so everyday) moments, the DX4900 is a great camera to start with.  At 4.0 megapixels, the quality of your pictures will be the envy of your family and friends.  For everyday/normal/touristy use, this is just perfect.Highly Recommended", "Date": "December 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "$MP is finally priced right!!", "Author": "Larry Lee White \"larrylwhite\"", "ReviewID": "R22HKLEF6N4EDD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Kodak's under [money] for a real 4 mega-pixel, multi-funtion digital camera that is comfortable,easy to use & comes with a 16MB CF card & lithium battery.

Every person that views these printed pictures can not believe that the photos were not devloped from negatives, also everyone asked \"what digital camera do you have and how much does it cost\".  My 895Cse is just an average ... printer.  The camera is very easy and fun to use. This Camera exceeded all my expectations especilly in photo quality.  Following are a few insights.1. I purchased a Sandisk 256mb ultra memory card ... This is more card than you need.  I can take 206 4MP pictures before the card is full.  I recomend Sandisk ultra card but only the 128mb. (the ultra card is very fast, I can snap off pictures within 2-3 seconds one after the other).2.The camera includes a usb cable,with the Sandisk card and XP os my pictures transfer from my camera to my computer fast,(less than one min. for 250 4mp pictures). I opted to not purchase the \"camera dock\" instead I purchased a \"monster\" battery charger that came with 2 sets of NiMH batteries plus an additional 2 sets of batteries,... These digital cameras use up batteries fast. The camera comes with batteries that can only be charged using the kodak camera dock,(the batteries only work with the kodak camera).Even if you do not think you will use all these batteries, using the regular NiMH batteries and charger is the way to go, your batteries can be used in other devices and the charger is compact and easy to carry with you, the Kodak camera dock is larger and can only charge kodak batteries.... Each set of fully charged batteries will take apprx 40 pictures using the cameras digital view.3. The Camera does not come with a case. I purchased a perfect case at Compusa for [money].4.

When I made the decision to upgrade I did alot of research and came to the conclusion that there were several good options for quality digital cameras in the $400 price range. After reading many reviews and speaking to many people who were familiar with both the Sony, Canon, and Kodak I opted for the Kodak 4900.  I am extrememly pleased with my decision and love this camera and its' docking station (a must).I just returned from a three week European vacation and had such a blast taking pictures, deleting those I did not like, retaking the picture with different settings, etc.  This camera has alot of flexibility but is so very easy to use.  After spending 30 minutes reading the instruction book I was good-to-go.  One of the things that amazed me with this camera is what good pictures it took in low light conditions.  All I had to do was make an adjustment to the light conditions on the camera; I was able to take great pictures up on the bright snowy alps as well as pictures of a lit up castle on a hill at dusk.  I agree with a previous review on the Kodak editing software that came with my camera.  I do not like it and have opted to use PhotoSuite software to fine tune my pictures.  I upgrated the memory to 128MB and purchased 2 sets of rechargeable double AA batteries and a charger (for $20).  With the docking station the rechargeabe batteries aren't really even necessary but they came in handy during my vacation.One last comment, I watched the sales ads.  Best Buy had the camera on sale for $349.00  I took the ad to Circuit City and they matched the price-as well as threw in 2 packs of photo software.", "Date": "June 20, 2002"}, {"Title": "Awesome pictures!", "Author": "J. Smith", "ReviewID": "R312T2E8MLJQJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes flawless photographs at almost any distance, and at almost any light.  There are lower resolution modes and also a high-compression mode, but this does degrade the quality of the image (perhaps the reason for some of the unfavorable reviews?).  Also, Kodak has some extra lenses available, one of them being a 2x zoom lense (I've ordered it, but it's still in the mail), which I am hoping will give me 1x to 4x zoom, which is actually BETTER than the 3x zoom you get on most digital cameras.  They also have a close-up lense for taking pictures of things like stamps if you are interested in that sort of thing.The downside is that you don't get a camera bag, and the 16MB memory card is too small.  I think the 64MB memory card is perfect for me, but then I have a laptop that I can take with me and dump the pictures onto when the card gets full.  The camera also comes with a lithium battery, so you still need to buy either a charger or a cradle (both come with one rechargable battery pack).  Buy an extra battery pack so you don't get caught without juice!  The lithium battery packs last only about twice as long as a charged battery pack, but they cost more ..., so definitely go rechargable! Even without accessories, however, this is a great camera, and you can't get this kind of resolution for this price anywhere else.  I've taken some absolutely breathtaking nature photographs after having the camera for only a few days.  The automatic shutter speed is great for evening and low light situations, and I haven't even tried some of the cooler features of the camera yet.One more thing - think about investing in some photo-editing software.  The camera takes great base pictures, but they still need to be brightness, contrast, and color adjusted.  And cropped.  And retouched.  I like the ULead stuff myself, because it is [reasonably priced] and powerful.  But there are a number of very good tools available for less than [money], and you can really spruce up your favorite photos pretty quickly and easily with the right software.  In my opinion, it is the ability to edit the photos that MAKES digital photography so powerful, and the higher resolution you go in with, the better the end result.  Although Kodak provides some image editing software with the camera, it was really pretty poor.  I definitely recommend getting something better (though you may not need it at first depending on what you want to do, and your level of experience).Great camera, great pictures, great price.  Plan on spending at least another [money] on accessories (battery charger or cradle, memory card update, camera bag, optional add-on lenses), and maybe [money] on software if you don't already have a favorite image editing tool.  Once you have it all in place though, you get to take as many high-resolution photos as you want to for almost free!  And I am telling you, I was just blown away at how some of my photos came out.

The last straw was when I went to Chicago and forgot to turn my flash on for all the indoor shots.  In fact, I forgot to turn it on for ALL of the pictures.  Needless to say, I got about 5 good shots of the Chicago skyline and a whole lotta GRAY pictures.  So, it was time to look into digital technology.  I wanted a digital camera for the instant preview and ability to delete a bad one in mere seconds.  I am a photography novice, and I needed something for point-and-shoot situations.  The Kodak EasyShare DX4900 hit the jackpot.  Easy to use, lightweight and not bulky (but not so little that I would get a hand cramp from trying to hold onto it!), automatic EVERYTHING, and a super little LCD screen to view my pictures.  The big test was on a trip to California.  I have pictures that are, in my opinion, museum quality.  Or at least postcard quality.  I have never been more pleased with a piece of equipment!A few drawbacks - the EasyShare dock is NOT included, and it is necessary! (...additional $..., so figure adding that into your spending budget as I did), and the little LCD screen get a little smudgy at times (nothing a quick swipe with an eyeglasses-cleaning cloth couldn't handle), and the rechargable battery didn't last very long.  When you see the CRV 3V Lithium Batteries on sale, STOCK UP. ...a frequent photographer could go broke!  The zoom lens is a little sub-par, but I didn't really notice since I have never had a camera with a zoom lens, anyway.  Also, if you are considering purchasing a digital camera and want to rely on the LCD screen as your viewfinder, you might be disappointed with the Kodak EasyShare DX4900.  Using it that way will eat your batteries, and the image is a little shaky and grainy.

When I received the DX4900 I was somewhat disappointed for its lightweight and plastic case but I have to admit that this is the best combination of features and capabilities for under 400 bucks. At this time (July 11th) you hardly would find any 4MP camera for under $500, and Kodak just do it with this gem.Very easy to use, and yet plenty of settings to tweak if you are like me.

If you are looking a camera for remote photography, maybe you should look for some Mavica models which delivers up to 20X.The Kodak DX4900 speed is quite good (compared to an eternity in any Mavica), and the image quality, after some fine tuning, is great.

The 2:1 optical zoom is its Achilles Heel, but the 4 megapixel resolution is outstanding for anyone who wants to do some serious photo enlarging (adequate for printing 11\" x 14\" photos). The optional docking station (not included in this package) makes this a very simple camera to recharge and it also makes the transferring of images to a PC almost foolproof. That means a great deal, as the 4900, left in its cradle, is always charged and ready to go, and once returned to its cradle, archiving or emailing becomes an easy task even for a novice. The overall quality is good, though there's a bit of a  cheap plastic feel to it. The weight and balance are also just fair.

I love that it has 4 megapixils, more features than the other EasyShare Kodak cameras, unbelievable simplicity of use, and a relatively small (pocket) size. The best feature in my opinion is that you can autofocus and take a picture in about half a second, which is great for a digital camera. (If you try to take more than one picture that quick, forget it, things slow down a lot after the first picture.)I took about 200 photos in my first week with this camera and I couldn't believe how great they looked on my screen... until I looked at them at their true size (100% image size). All of the pictures are grainy when you look at them at their full size. Look at them at 75% size and they look great. What I think this means is that the camera is really more like a 2-3 megapixil camera that makes images in the 4 megapixil size. If you are printing 4x6 images you won't have a problem with the camera's resolution, but don't believe what Kodak says on the box that you can have \"Crisp, clear Prints at any size even up to 20x30 poster.\" It just isn't true. My 8x10 prints of DX4900 images on my photoprinter look pleasing but have very visible graininess that I never saw when I printed on the same printer using images from my old 3 megapixil sony camera. I called Kodak tech support and told them about this problem, they told me to return the camera because it must be defective. I took Kodak's advice but my new DX4900 has the same problem with its images. I hate knowing that I bought a camera that doesn't really live up to its marketing and my hopes.One other love/hate thing about the camera: its images are often under 1MB in file size. They would be a good deal larger on most 4 megapixil digital cameras. This means you can get more images on a memory card... a good thing. Unfortunately, it means the DX4900 is compressing the images a lot and highly compressed images lose quality. There is no way to force the camera to decrease the compression of the images, only to increase the compression. When considering the Kodak DX4900 you have to ask yourself the question \"can I be happy sacrificing image quality for a lower price and ease of use?\" It is a tough question to answer.

This is really the best.  I started with an old HP 315, which was a fun camera (2mp), but very stripped down.  When that broke, I got a Kodak 3900 (this fellow's precursor - 3.1 mp), which I loved.  The colors were truer than those of the HP, the macro mode was impressive for as cheap of a digital as it is, and the focusing seemed to come more easily.  That died on me and I had a very brief stint with an HP 715 (3mp, discontinued, a piece of [poo], that was my only choice with my replacement warranty at that time).  I couldn't get it to interface properly with my computer (I work with computers, too, it just wasn't a good camera) and returned it for my 4900.  Although the lens on the big HP is superior, the extra megapixels in the 4900 as well as the ease of use more than make up for it.  I enjoy using the b&w; modes to test out scenes before taking a picture with my SLR and it works great for that.  It takes decent night pictures (just don't shake it around, unless you want some interesting effects), great outdoor pictures.  The light sensor is fairly predictable.  People that know a bit about exposure will appreciate the exposure compensation button - the EV values that they list seem to line up fairly well with my SLR, too.The upload time is FAST (less than a second per highest quality picture as compared to 4-5 seconds per picture on the HP 715), the pictures take awhile to store, but you can rack up a few in sequence and it'll just store them as you're taking more.  The viewfinder *is* fairly inaccurate, so if you're striving for a perfect shot, use the screen (especially in macro mode).  That said, it's great to save batteries with the view-finder.  You just end up getting more in the picture that you bargained for, which can be cropped.  With the HP715, I found I'd always get slightly less than the viewfinder advertised (not good).The 2X optical zoom / 3X digital mix would be better reversed :) but that would bump up the price of the camera.  I'm sure this is one way Kodal trimmed features.  Still, I had NO optical zoon on my first digital, so this is about all I'm used to.Also, after using the HP715 for a couple of weeks, I've learned to appreciate the speed of focusing, even in a slightly lower light.  I could NOT get an infocus picture with the HP because the focusing mechanism just woudln't catch.  It had the curious habit of always focusing on the background, even if there was a large light-coloured object in the foreground that I was going for.  That's not how most autofocus sensors work and, happily, that's not how Kodak does theirs.For a point-and-shoot, I'd call this a pleasure to use.

What's the use of having a camera if you cannot use the zoom.3) Rechargable batter would lose 1/2 it's life after several days of non-use.4) Cannot tell you how many times I tried to turn camera one and could not figure out why it was not operational.5) Last straw was when I lost 70 pictures with 256MB Flash card at 2MP level.  Things were great until I turned camera off.  When I turned it back on, it said \"need to format\".  I had used the flash card for hundreds of pictures.I ended up taking camera back.", "Date": "August 24, 2002"}, {"Title": "Some nice features but...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2GO9NSCIWH4JC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have noticed that a lot of the reviews for this camera mention taking shots of flowers, landscape, etc.  I think this camera would be excellent for those applications.  However, having gone through 3 digital cameras of varying price and quality, I would suggest a good old 35 mm if you are planning to take photos of children, pets, anything that moves.  If you've never used digital, I think this one is too expensive to use as a starter camera.  Start with something less expensive and decide whether you want to dedicate yourself to digital before you spend several hundred dollars on this camera.  I went digital when I had a baby, and can honestly say that my best photos have come from the many disposable cameras I've bought when I've been fed up with blurry pictures.  I do like the docking station this one has, which makes it easy to transfer photos and charge the battery.  If you're set on digital and know it can meet your needs, I think this is a good choice.  Easy to customize exposure, color, sharpness, shutter speed.  But those new to digital and looking to take action photos (action includes a child stacking blocks or even just turning his head) should start with something lower-end, or buy from a store with a good return policy.  I just don't think the convenience of digital (especially a relatively expensive digital like this one) outweighs the quality of film.

Overall a good deal, the software that comes with it is easy to use and helpful, if a bit simplistic.

I got a 128 mb card for (US)[money] after a mail-in rebate, and it holds 102 pictures at highest quality. Good quality, easy interface, though sometimes lacking in freedom to tweak camera settings.

The 4 MP doesn't give enough picture quality. 4MP is just a marketing thing, its actual quality is more like 2MP.2. Visible purple fringing/ chromatic aberrations.3. LCD monitor is not good, tough to see anything on in sunlight. Using a cheapish LCD helps drive profit margins higher for Kodak on this.4. Unacceptable time lag when veiewing on LCD.5. Takes more than 13 secs to write anything on the CF card. Even my last year's Fuji was much better than this !6. Poor viewing capabilites.7. You need to spend lots of extra money to get its dock. Why doesn't Kodak sell it along with camera itself ? After all it hardly worth 15 bucks !8. Missing features like movie/audio, Video out, atleast some manual controls etc. or atleast a 3x optical zoomI have compared this camera to other Canon/Sony ones and find this way below on quality/features compared to them. I see that many people here have a 5 star review for this, but then maybe its their first experience with a digicam. Kodak needs to improve the quality of their products and stop making such shabby cameras. Buy a Canon S200 or S330 or A40 and you will be much more happy. They have much more features and have very good metallic bodies. Don't buy this plastic junk.

If anyone is looking to get into the world of digital photography, or anyone looking to move up to a camera with higher resolution - this camera is it! At 4.0 mega-pixels - the photos from the DX4900 are just stunning. Take some close-up shots using the macro mode and you will be amazed at the detail this camera picks up. You will really see the detail and true to life color if you have some of your photos printed at a photo center. With my Apple iMac Computer and Mac OS X, using this camera is truly 'plug and play'. You don't even have to install any software to download your photos to the computer - the software is built into OS X. Just plug one end of the included USB cable to the DX 4900 and the other end to the Mac (no need for the Kodak docking station) and your photos are automatically transferred. What could be easier. Battery life is very good with this camera - I have taken almost a hundred shots, at the highest resolution, with just one pair of rechargeable batteries. Another plus is that this camera uses Compact Flash (CF) storage media. This is the most widely used storage media format in digital cameras and also the least expensive. Get the largest capacity CF card you can afford, believe me you'll use it. 128MB or 256MB cards are the best value in my opinion. The zoom capabilities are a bit limited by the 2X optical zoom lens. The 3X digital zoom, in effect, allows for a total zoom of 6X - but at a cost to clarity.

It was  my first digital camera and has allowed me to become comfortable with using a digital camera.  However, as other reviewers have mentioned, I had problems with my camera.  At the time the problems fell under the one year warranty.  When I got the camera back the first time, it did not work from the get-go.  I had to turn right around and send it back for repair.  (Which, by the way, if Kodak determines that the damage to the camera is due to it being dropped or the like you have to pay for the repair reguardless of the warranty.)  The camera has worked fine since the second repair.  The zoom function is disappointing.  It works fairly well for zooming in on up close portrait type shots or focusing in on some group shots.  I prefer a lot more zooming ability.  Some pics, on occation, turn out blurry for no apparent reason.  And to determine if the pic is blurry before you download or print it you have to take the time to change the function on the camera and use the zoom function on the LCD--possibly blowing good photo opportunities.I can turn out pretty good prints on my home printer (Dell).  The picture quality is good even on larger pictures.  It works really well for emailing pictures as well.  The dock is very convenient.  The photo editing software is OK, but could be better.  One of the options on the editing software is the \"Auto Enhance\" which almost always seems to lighten the pics up too much and makes the complection of the subject very washed out.  The \"Exposure\" function in the software works better if a pic needs overall adjustment usually.Overall this is a good beginner's digital camera, but after one year of having the camera I am now longing for a Minolta Dimage.
