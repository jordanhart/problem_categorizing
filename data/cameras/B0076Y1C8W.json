{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice little camera", "Author": "Terri262", "ReviewID": "R1SSVD9OH4HB6B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got this camera for our teenage son, and I have ended up using it quite a bit because I like it better than my Canon camera. It is small but has all of the features of larger cameras. It takes nice pics which is the bottom line for me. All of the controls are located in roughly the same location and operate about the same as most of today's point and shoot cameras. I felt the first reviewer was extremely harsh. Perhaps he has extra large thumbs, because the controls don't get in my way at all. One thing I would improve is the flash controls. I often times will turn off the flash as sometimes I prefer that; but there are about three clicks to make to turn it off; then when you turn on the camera again, you have to do it again if that is what you want. Can't recall if other cameras retain the last setting they were on or not. If you don't tend to fiddle with the flash, won't be an issue for you, just leave it on automatic.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fabulously feature-rich camera", "Author": "William S Granger", "ReviewID": "R3N9WJFC45YX54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fabulously feature-rich camera ... macro function and 12.5x magnification and 14 MP capability make this a great buy.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "RLOWOQLFLWEBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I realize that the average consumer digital camera is getting better and better, offering more megapixels and packed with more features, so I can't say this is the best out there by any means. But I can say  that it is the best camera that I HAVE EVER OWNED.This is the first camera I have owned that picks the right lighting and decides when to use the closeup lens. I built models in foamcore of our home in order to study possible room remodel options, and I could stick my hand down inside a little room and the camera made every  picture come out clearly and in focus. I love it. I found a carry case that allows me to store an extra battery, since if the camera has any negative, it is that it runs out of juice pretty fast. Al in all, I love this little camera.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best optical quality, especially for ultra wide-angle shots", "Author": "RiverGuy", "ReviewID": "R273DMT7Q3Y04G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These are amazing cameras for the money.  They come very close to the Panasonic ZS-x family, lacking only the GPS feature, while being MUCH more compact.  DSLR photographers will appreciate the VR-330 in the same way that pro film photographers loved the Stylus Epic point-and-shoot film cameras of the late '70s and early '80s.  I wanted an inexpensive point-and-shoot with top notch optics and a 24mm equivalent wide-angle, and I am delighted with the VR-330.  Also, you can get the same lens minus a few bells and whistles with the VR-320, for about $20 less.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dawn's camera", "Author": "Dawn G.

The controls are right in the way when gripping the camera and changes settings when not intending to. Also, the flash is on the wrong side for right handed people. My fingers interfere with the flash.I use this for work (company supplied)and never can get a decent flash picture indoors. Pictures turn out exposure wise better without the flash, but if you don't hold the camera perfectly still, everything will blur.All in all, not really a decent camera.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Olympus VR-330 Camera", "Author": "Brent C. Horton \"Rough on Phones\"", "ReviewID": "R3EFKJFVXFGON2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just purchased to replace an aging Nikon. Everything working and as easy as the Nikon. Zoom is a finger touch at the exposure button. Pictures are easy to take. I take over 100 pictures at each job I do, so it's not like I am unfamiliar with cameras. I do wish there was an external charger rather than having to use the camera for a charger base. I have no clue as to how many pictures I can take between charges but we shall see. More to come as I do more with the camera. I would give it more than 3 stars, but out of the box and setup was easy, so 3 stars it is for now. I'll use it a week or so and report back", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$179.99", "Features": "An amazing 14 million pixels in the high-resolution CCD create superior image quality\nThe 12.5x wide-angle (24mm) optical zoom lets you get closer to the action while the 24mm wide-angle lens lets you capture more in your shot.\nThis huge 3-inch LCD features an extra-wide viewing angle for easier composing and shooting\n720P HD MOVIE & HDMI CONTROL\nDiscover the depth of 3D stills.
