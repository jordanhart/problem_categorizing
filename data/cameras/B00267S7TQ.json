{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Somewhat Surprising Findings, NO RECALL and a Heck of a Deal!", "Author": "Todd \"Todd\"", "ReviewID": "RK6YW07BCRI5B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a D5000 with the 18-55 VR lens from Amazon last Friday (Black Friday).  I paid about $200 less than a friend who bought the same camera a few months ago.  AND... It is NOT part of the recall!  My biggest initial concern was getting caught up in the recall.  I am very happy to say that Amazon seems to be beyond those serial numbers - at least with the kit (camera and 18-55 VR lens).I'm upgrading from a D50 I bought 4 or more years ago.  There are a number of reasons why I chose THIS camera.  First, I like Nikon over other brands because they are easier to use/better menus for those of us who aren't experts.  I also think that Nikon makes the best lenses.  Even their cheapest kit lenses have great optics and take great pictures.  Not all manufacturers can say that.The second thing I want to address is this camera's lack of an internal motor to auto focus a lens.  In other words, you need Nikon's AF-S lenses with this camera.  (Note: almost all of Nikon's lenses work with this camera and auto focus.)  I would only think it is a concern for someone who has really old lenses, a non-Nikon lens like Sigma or Tamron without an auto focus motor built-in, or possibly some specialty lens that won't auto focus on its own.  For me, I have purchased 4 different lenses over the last 4-5 years.  They all work just fine.  While it is something to be aware of, I think most people who are looking at this camera will be fine too.  The lack of an internal motor means the D5000 is slightly smaller and lighter than the next step up - cheaper too.  This makes the D5000 easier to hang around your neck and carry around all day.  This camera is not targeted at a pro, though it is very capable of taking pro pictures.  Pros are more likely to opt for the D90 or above.Third - My D50, the D40, D60, D70 and D80 are all Generation 1 cameras.  (Actually the D40 & D60, may be called Generation 2, but are more Generation 1.5)  Nikon's current lineup, the D3000, D5000, D90 and D300s, are all Generation 2 cameras.  What the reviews say is that the Generation 2 cameras take better pictures.  They see things more the way the human eye sees things.  I am at that point where I am trying to learn more about photography and take better pictures.  I did my research.  The D3000 is a light camera that you can carry around all day without getting neck cramp.  The problem with the D3000 for me was that all the reviews said how much noise (little purple dots that look like film grain) showed up in photos at the higher ISOs.  The D90 is a great camera with numerous features that appeal to someone who has some idea what ISO and F stops mean and how they affect the quality of the photo.  The D5000's problem, until recently, has been that it was too closely priced to the D90.  There was just no reason not to take the extra step up to the D90.  Now that Nikon and Amazon have dropped the price of the D5000, it is a much better value.  The D90 with the same 18-55 VR lens is about $300 more expensive than the D5000 as of this writing.  The D5000 uses the same sensor (and some other parts) as the much more expensive D90 and D300s.  It is a newer camera than the D90.  I would think, but don't have actual knowledge, that this would have a positive effect on some of the advanced features in the D5000.  I say this because the software in the D5000 is newer.  It does NOT have the noise problems of the D3000.  If you cannot afford the D5000, I suggest you consider the D40 (while supplies last) over the D3000.  The D40 takes better pictures and costs less.Video - Do NOT buy a DSLR to shoot videos.  NO DSLR from any manufacturer does this really well.  The technology is too new.  Video on a DSLR is a goof, something neat/fun to play with and not something to take too seriously.  DSLRs are designed to take really good photographs.  If you need good video, buy a camcorder!In my opinion, the D5000 is THE camera for folks new to DSLRs who need something simple, but with great capabilities and those, like me, who want to take a step up in features/capabilities without having to spend over $900 dollars for the D90 and a lens.  While Live View has its limitations, the articulating screen (it swivels - very cool feature) on the D5000 will make it easier for me to take those occasional hard to get photos.I really think I made the right choice and got what I feel is a heck of a deal!  I hope this information is useful to those of you who are still trying to decide which camera is best for you.One last thought... Nikons seem to hold their value.  I plan to sell my D50 - AND - there seems to be a market for it.  Once I learn what ISO and F stops are (I have some idea, but am still learning.), I will likely sell my D5000 and buy whatever the next step up is.  I think this is a great added value to buying a good name brand camera like Nikon.  All the best...**Update 1/3/10** Well, I've had a chance to shoot a few hundred photos with my new D5000.  I did a direct comparison with about 150 photos between my old D50 and the new D5000.  The output of my old D50 and the new D5000 are remarkably close.  These side by side comparisons were shot with the same lens (Nikkor 16-85mm VR and Nikon NC filter), the built in flash and the Nikon SB 800 flash.  I took some shots in \"Auto\" and many shots in \"P\".  I used every ISO and color controll the D5000 had and tried to tweak them up and down (sharpness, saturation and hue).  I've decided to return the D5000, and then decided to keep it, and here's why.The added megapixels of the D5000 seem to have very little effect in the amount of detail in the photos as compared to my D50.  The D50 has a 6 megapixel sensor.  (I DID tweak the settings of my D50 to get better output.  I will tweak the settings of the D5000 too.)  And, the D50 seemed to have a slightly more reliable/consistent meter when shooting in auto white balance.  All this really surprised me.  I guess I was expecting more of a difference between the two cameras.  The D50 probably has one of the most accurate meters in any Nikon digital camera - better than the D40 and D60.  In the thousands of photos I took over 4-5 years, it got the white balance spot on every time.In defense of the D5000, it does have features far beyond those of the D50.  It is these features that have made me decide to keep the D5000.  The software in the D5000 allows you to adjust many more aspects of how the camera operates and takes pictures than what my D50 had.  This allowed me to tweak any settings that I was not completely happy with.  It also has numerous preset scene modes for those who want to treat the D5000 more as a really good point and shoot.  I guess this camera gives the user enough features where even prosumers could be happy with the creative flexibility the controls give.The D5000 has a number of other advantages over the D50.  The first is a time saver for me.  Its auto distortion controll seems to handle lens distortion \"in camera\" when the pictures are taken.  Having the camera address lens distortion saves me from having to fix it after the photos are taken.  I shoot quite a bit with a 12-24mm lens that tends to twist things some.  I also took several test photos of a very square surface with a 70-300mm lens at different focal lengths.  You could see the lens distortion through the view finder.  Big bonus... The auto distortion control really seems to work!  Additional features include much better low light performance (The D50 and many other cameras will never touch the D5000's low light performance.), ADR (it will capture detail inside shadows rather than just turning the shadow black.), a larger-articulating screen that is much easier to see and read (the D5000 displays the camera settings on the rear screen instead of an LCD on top of the camera.), live view (I recommend using this only for those hard to get photos when you just can't use the view finder.  It can take 3 to 8 seconds to focus in live view.) auto focus with 3D tracking for photographing subjects that are moving, and a smaller and lighter form factor than the D50.The bottom line for me was that my old D50 took really good photos in good conditions.  The D5000 takes only slightly better pictures than my D50 in good conditions.  In less than perfect conditions, the D5000 seems to take much better photos than my D50.  If you're upgrading like me and none of these added features mean anything to you, keep your current camera.  Otherwise, while not completely perfect, the D5000 can be a good upgrade or a very capable first dslr that is easy to use AND will give you the room and controls to expand your skills and your creativity as you learn.I did play with a variety of settings in my new D5000.  The \"One Change\" that seemed to make the biggest improvement in the quality of the photos was to adjust the sharpness settings in the Picture Controls menu.  I have turned the sharpness settings way up over the factory defaults.  The factory settings ranged from 2 to 4 (on a scale of 1 to 9).  I greatly prefer setting the sharpness more in the 5 to 8 range.  You can adjust the sharpness for the different modes - 5 for images you want to be softer like portraits, and 6, 7 or 8 for everything else.  If you shoot in \"auto mode\", these changes won't work.  You will need to move to \"P\" or some other setting to take advantage of this.  If you try it, I think you will be pleased at how much sharper and how much more detail you get in your photos over the factory settings.The information I share comes in part from personal experience and in part from reading reviews and information all over the web - not because I'm some pro photographer.  For anyone who cares to read more, I recommend checking out Ken Rockwell.  You can Google him. He rates ALL of these cameras and provides useful information like tips on how to setup your D5000 once you buy it.  Note: The guide to setting up the D5000 is burried in the site. If you click the \"Nikon\" link, then go down to \"Plain English User Guides\", you will find it.  His guide to setting the camera up is separate from the review of the D5000 on his site.  If you follow his suggestions when adjusting the saturation levels (color), you should know that you CAN really get some wild colors - colors that are not natural.  I didn't get this the first time and got some really crazy output from the camera.  I decided to leave most of the color settings set at the factory defaults.  I saved two custom settings with the saturation level turned up one notch for pictures taken outside and in good sunlight.  If you screw up the settings on the camera, it is easy to restore the factory default settings.  So, don't be affraid to try different things.  Ken recommends setting the sharpness settings to 5. As I said before, I prefer to go even sharper and use settings that range from 5 to 8.  Ken's only beef with the D5000 was that Nikon started with it too closely priced to the D90.  The D5000 shares the same sensor and A LOT of other parts from the more expensive D90.  This makes the D5000 a fantastic camera and a great value at its current price point.  Amazon lists the link to the DPReview review on the D5000 page or you can Google it.  People may want to read the DPReview of the D5000 before reading Ken Rockwells Guide to setting up the D5000. DPReview tells you whats wrong with the factory default settings on the D5000. Ken Rockwell tells you how to adjust the factory settings to get even better photos!  I know I'm rambling a bit here. I'm going to so much effort here only because the reviews on Amazon have provided me so much helpful information in the past.  I am just trying to give something back.  Oh, I DID sell my D50 for $350!  I was very happy to get this kind of money for a camera that was 4 or 5 years old.

If you are new to the DSLR game (like myself) or you are upgrading and you can fork up the cash, it is definitely worth it.  It has a very concise, simple, and easy to use interface, the buttons are very well placed, and the swivel LCD is very nice and useful in certain situations (I really like how it folds inwards to protect the screen).  My main purpose for this camera is still photos so the video is a cool bonus and is surprisingly better than I thought (though if you are looking to do serious HD video, I'd go for an HD camcorder or something else instead).The D5000 is essentially a D90 squeezed into a smaller lighter body (of course it lacks the internal AF motor, doesn't have as good a grip, and has a slightly smaller pentamirror viewfinder instead of the pentaprism in the D90 - all of this amongst a few other things, but hey it's cheaper for a reason - also it is mentionable that the D5000 has an additional live view mode, a few more in camera editing tools, and more scene modes compared to the D90 - all useful for someone new to the DSLR in the sense that you can learn from them or just use them to make your life easier and your photos look great).So far I love it.  It is simple to use and great for those new to the DSLR realm, but it also packs enough punch for those looking to upgrade and will give newcomers much room to learn and grow with it.", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Liking it a lot so-far", "Author": "Dave H", "ReviewID": "R32WFY2KVL9O30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Out of the box, my first impression wasn't the best, as camera size and feel are more like my entry level D40 than I expected. Of course there's the movable LCD (which is more useful than I thought) and Live View button, but not too much more to separate the outer look and feel from D40 mode.Then I spent some time setting things up and shooting - and all of a sudden I'm loving this thing.- The menus, IMHO, are waaaay better than anything I seen on other Nikons (mostly D40 and D200 experience) ISO adjustments and AUTO decisions all in one place,  the access to the Info parameters on screen is really clean, and the LCD clarity is great.- The high ISO performance for low light is quite good for my purposes.  Sure you get some noise, but you get the shot - and if you are getting material for web and simple uses - it's perfect.- The wiggly LCD screen is helpful for reading the menus and changing settings with the camera, say, in your lap. Also helpful at odd angles to review what you just shot.  I use it more for those purposes than the live view.So what don't I like?  The video isn't real useful. Zooming without autofocus isn't much fun.  Moving, even a little, creates odd artifacts in the 24p video -so don't think of any zoomed hand-held shots.  Tripod, basic static focal length maybe.  I don't know whether video editing sw like Final Cut Pro is ready to ingest these video files.Overall - I really enjoy shooting this camera - and the images are excellent.I'll try to post a few.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade from the D40, but Auto White Balance doesn't work reliably", "Author": "amazon customer", "ReviewID": "RRAIFO3TVPGOK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a D5000 locally ten days ago and exchanged it for another one three days ago.The first thing I did was get out in the early morning light and take some landscape photos with the D5000 and my D40.  Over the next few days I continued taking dozens of photos testing various settins on the D5000.  I used my old 18-55mm non-VR zoom lens and the new 35mm f/1.8 lens.Right away, it was obvious that the D5000's image quality greatly exceeds the D40's.  First, megapixels DO matter if you want to look at your photos on a big monitor, and they add texture to the details of landscapes.  Second, I don't know what processing magic Nikon has rolled into the D5000, but it handles low light with more subtlety and predictability.  Caveat: While Active D-Lighting is generally desirable, it may sacrifice contrast that you want to keep in strong lighting situations.The one problem I have experienced is that many of the photos came with a strong yellow-ochre cast suggesting that the camera was pushing too much amber into the white balance.  Green grass would turn chartreuse and blue skies would become pale.  This occurred unpredictably, perhaps 75% of the time.  The rest of the images would have what look to me like perfect colors--much better and more subtle than the D40, which is pretty good.  (I am evaluating these photos on a calibrated color-accurate monitor.)After fiddling with white balance settings, hue, WB bracketing, turning ADL on and off, etc., etc., I returned the first camera, only to find that the second one does the same thing.  Yesterday, however, I stumbled across the fact that if you select \"Direct Sunlight\" WB instead of \"Auto White Balance\" (and you actually have sunlight) the problem goes away and the colors are perfect.A little more research on the internet indicates that the unpredictable behavior of Auto White Balance is a well known problem on many digital cameras.  Essentially the camera is trying to guess what lighting conditions apply, but most of the experts who came up in my search strongly recommended manually selecting and/or adjusting white balance.  Now, I  didn't think that my D40 or the other cameras I owned had this problem, but maybe the other issues they did have were related.  For instance, the D40 often put a faint blue cast into shadow areas that wasn't there.  A D60 that I briefly owned was worse in this regard.Like the D40 before it, the D5000's manual recommends Auto White Balance for most situations, but you may want to question that.  This is a bit a disappointment, because the way Nikon has intelligently automated so many menu choices is part of the D5000's excitement, but it seems that the Auto White Balance problem is common among DSLRs.", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent for entry, mid-level, and prosumer users.", "Author": "Mark E", "ReviewID": "RU83SVGM9FPHI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR camera, and I can say right off that it's very easy to use and takes amazing photos.  I chose the D5000 because a friend who is a professional photographer recommended it saying  I should invest my money in lenses not the body.  I believe this is true, but there is a consideration to make when purchasing the D5000, or the other Nikon entry-level cameras such as the D40/D40x/D60/D3000, and that has to do with the auto-focus motor.The D5000, which tops Nikon's entry-level line, does not include an auto-focus motor in the body, instead it relies on a \"silent wave\" auto-focus mechanism in the lens (AF-S).  This is supposed to be very quiet and fast, though I don't know if that's true compared to the screw-drive motors used in other camera bodies.  It's also supposed to be more cost effective and allow for a smaller/lighter camera body, but again I'm not sure if that is quite true or exactly why Nikon chose this option for their entry level line (if anybody knows more about this please feel free to comment).  However, this option will limit users who already have a collection of Nikon AF lenses (not AF-S), as well as those purchasing a Nikon for the first time.  The AF lenses will work fine but have to be manually focused.  That said, more experienced users would probably not be purchasing an entry-level model; a more appropriate starting point would be the D90.So as far as lens compatibility?  The first lens I sought to purchase was a fast prime (FFL) unit for indoor/low-light and portraits.  I looked at the low-priced 50mm f/1.8D AF, but the auto-focus is not compatible.  Same with the faster and more expensive 50mm f/1.4D AF, as well as the 35mm f/2D AF. Also, no luck with the Tamron or Sigma FFL units, though I did see some Tamron zoom lenses with AF-S compatibility.  I became very concerned that my options would be severely restricted, and perhaps I would need to return the camera and upgrade to the D90 or go with the Canon T1i. However, I discovered the 50mm f/1.4G SIC SW, which came out last year, and also the more moderately priced 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX which currently sells for about $200.  That unit came out earlier this year (I haven't chosen yet). I also went to the Nikon homepage, and noted that 30 of the 50 current auto-focus lenses listed were AF-S, so while the options are limited, the average non-professional user shouldn't have a problem finding an appropriate lens for the occasion - including many professional level models. I also suspect that Nikon will include AF-S in more if not all future auto-focus lenses. Users will find the least options with Nikon's wide-angel, standard, and telephoto models. Most of the super telephoto, wide-angle zoom, standard zoom, high powered zoom and close up lenses include AF-S.PROS of the D50001. Has virtually the same image sensor as the D90 and D300. This puts the D5000 in good company, and one could argue it's more of a prosumer or mid-level class camera than its entry-level predecessor, the D60.  It's almost a D90, but just lacking of a few options and the D90's ruggedness.  The difference is about $300.2. Flip LCD; I considered the Canon EOS Rebel T1i, and while both the Canon and Nikon have their advantages, both are very similar with the exception of Nikon's flip LCD.  I consider this more than just a novelty.  It not only protects the screen but is practical in some situations, such as shooting photos overhead.  The D90 does not have this function either.3. Easy to use; I got fantastic pictures right off using the auto mode as well as the pre-set scene selections.  However, users are not restricted to these options and experienced photographers should enjoy the camera alike. Just like the D90, the D5000 has scene modes on the dial, but it also has 13 additional modes from the menu which adds benefit to novice users. I tried the night landscape and sunset with excellent results.4. The lens is very good for a kit, and includes Vibration Reduction (VR). The lens by itself currently sells on Amazon for about $185 new, as appose to the model without VR which is currently priced at $110. Users may also want to pick up a fixed lens and/or higher power zoom, but the kit lens should be fine for most users. That said, I'm sure this camera could be taken to another level with the right lens.5. Long Battery Life6. Compact / Light weightCONS1. Price; the D5000 may be priced a little high for an \"entry-level\" camera, but again it's $300 less than the D90, and in many ways comparable. It's also slightly less than the Canon EOS Rebel T1i.2. Ruggedness; some may say it's a little \"toyish\" with the plastic finish, and being light (which isn't a bad thing), but overall it looks sharp and is well built.  I handled the D90 and some of the pro lines, they felt a little more rugged, but of course are designed for more abuse (and cost much more).3. AF-S auto-focus (see above)Bottom line, if you're looking for a great camera with the ability to produce real quality photos, but you don't want to spend a small fortune, the D5000 is a great choice.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "First DSLR and I Couldn't Be Happier!", "Author": "B. A. Chaney", "ReviewID": "R1Q9M83I10CQI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to upgrade to a DSLR a few months ago because I wanted to learn to take the fabulous pictures that I had come to associate with DSLRs.  After I made the decision, the next choice was Cannon or Nikon.  My current point and shoot camera was a Cannon PowerShot, so I thought I would stick with Cannon until I saw the specs on the D5000.  It had everything that I liked about my Cannon and was worried about giving up--video, a rotating screen with Live View--all in an affordable DSLR package, so I decided to take the plunge and go Nikon.After a month of using the camera in different situations--a trip to New York, a wedding, a bridal shower, a kid's birthday party--I couldn't be happier.  I'm very much a beginner when it comes to operating a DSLR, but all of the pictures I've taken with the D5000 have been excellent.  The camera was easy to pick up and start using, but it is also easy enough to learn to start customizing your shots for different situations.  I'm impressed by the camera's ability to help a beginner by auto-selecting some settings while allowing the photographer to manually select other things.  The kit lens is a good starter lens, and works for most of the situations I've shot in so far. I'm still learning what this camera can do, and I'm excited to know that the D5000, with its advanced features, can grow along with me as I develop as a photographer.In terms of size, I have small hands and I feel like I can comfortably carry around the D5000.  Yes it is bigger and heavier than a point and shoot, but it's not so big that its cumbersome for me to carry.  Which is a good thing, because I've started carrying this camera everywhere because I always want to be able to capture that perfect shot!If you're transitioning from a point and shoot to a DSLR and you want something with great features that still is easy to use, this is the camera for you.  I couldn't be happier with my D5000--when you get that crisp shot of a kid opening presents or a beautiful bride coming down the aisle, it's so worth it to have made this investment!", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Solid product and excellent image quality despite awkward design", "Author": "Enche Tjin", "ReviewID": "R1OGOIUODPKEAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The announcement of Nikon D5000 in April 2009 is quite unexpected for many people. D5000 is quite different than other Nikon beginner cameras (D40, D60), and it also does not resemble Nikon D90, a mid-range Nikon DSLR line.Nikon D5000 is an unique camera in Nikon line. It has swivel LCD screen (None of other Nikon DSLR has this feature), and it has movie mode (the second camera that has this feature in Nikon line after D90). Along with Nikon D3000, Nikon hopes that D5000 will be a huge success in this holiday season. D5000 will compete against Canon T1i / 500D.BODY & HANDLINGNikon D5000 weights 588g (with card and battery). The dimension is 127 x 104 x 80 mm which is a bit bigger and taller than D3000. From the top, Nikon D5000 looks exactly the same as Nikon D3000. It has info button, exposure compensation, shutter button and shooting mode ring.Nikon D5000 has a thumb dial which you can use to change aperture or other settings. It also has AE-AF lock button, live view button, four-way controller button, playback button, menu button, trash bin button, magnifying buttons (+ and -) and info button. On the left side, you have self timer (function) button which could be customized. I usually customized it to ISO setting.The layout and available buttons are very similar to Nikon D3000. If you are coming from higher end Nikon D80-D90 line, you might miss the image quality button, ISO button, AF release mode button, and White Balance button.BUILT QUALITY & ERGONOMICD5000 like all other Nikon beginner camera up to Nikon D90 has rugged plastic interior with textured \"rough\" finish. I like the textured finish more than smooth finish (like in Canon T1i camera).Ergonomically, it is good to hold, but the space between lens mount and the grip is pretty tight. If you mount bigger lens or if you have big hands, then you might not feel comfortable. However, I feel D5000 has slightly better ergonomic because it has a taller grip than D3000 or D60, so all of my fingers can rest on the grip, instead of hanging loose.LCD SCREEND5000 has unique vari-angle LCD screen. This swivel LCD is a little bit awkward because it swivel to the bottom not to the side like many other digital cameras. You can swivel the lcd screen down to 90 degree and then rotate it to left o right up to 270 degree. It is quite versatile for overhead or low angle shot. It is also very helpful when you are in live view mode or movie recording mode. However, I personally prefer if the lcd swivel to the side rather to the bottom, but I can understand why Nikon design it that way. Nikon tries to keep the layout / body interface as similar as other Nikon beginner cameras.Unfortunately, unlike D90, the LCD screen resolution is limited to 230k (the same as D3000). So you will be never able to check if your photos are in focus or not. Additionally, there is no top LCD screen like Nikon D90.LENS COMPATIBILITYNikon D5000 comes with Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 VR lens. This lens has a plastic mount, but the image quality and the light is recommendable. It never get super sharp like pro grade lens, but pro grade lens might costs more than ten times, so 18-55mm VR is one of the best value lens out in the market.The lens has image stabilization feature which is called Vibration Reduction (VR). It works well and quietly up to 3 stops. If you hold the camera tight and still, you can shoot up to a quarter second without motion blur.Unfortunately, D5000 does not have built in focus motor in the camera. Therefore, it can't auto focus older lenses such as the venerable Nikon 50mm f/1.8 or the legendary Nikon 85mm f/1.4D. If you need AF function, you need lens that has auto focus motor in it (AF-S lenses). If you are looking at third party lenses, look for HSM (Sigma lens) or motorized Tamron lenses.IMAGE QUALITY & ISONikon D5000 employs 12 megapixel sensor which is very similar to the one with Nikon D90. It produces better image quality than other Nikon beginner camera up to date.In low light situation, D5000  delivers clean image up to ISO 1600, and usable image at ISO 3200 if you expose it correctly. Image quality in high ISO setting is very satisfactory.Like other Nikon DSLR cameras, D5000 also has Auto ISO limiter. You can effectively limit the ISO and minimum shutter speed. The Auto ISO works very well and accurate most of the time. My favorite way to use this is to set the camera to Auto ISO, and then use Aperture mode and let the camera adjust the rest for me.AUTO FOCUS AND RELEASE MODED5000 has the same AF system as D3000 and D90. This AF system are quite reliable for everyday use. It comes with dynamic tracking and 3D tracking which is great for moving objects and sports. The auto focus is very fast and responsive. D3000 has 4 frame per second continuous shooting. It is neither fast or slow. For sports, dances or plays you might hope for faster burst.Quiet release mode: This is a new release mode unique to Nikon D5000 and later D300s. When you shoot in Q mode, you can full press and hold the shutter button to keep the mirror up. Then, when you release the shutter button, the mirror will flip down. I don't think this feature is quite useful because it does not really make the shutter release quieter, it just divides the shutter release into two steps. The beep sound that indicate the auto focus lock will be automatically turn off when you use this mode.INTERFACEDespite the lack of dedicated buttons for many important setting such as ISO, release mode, white balance etc, It is relatively easy and quick to change those setting. What you need to do is hit the INFO button twice and toggle to setting that you want to change and change it with the main thumb dial. It is not the most efficient interface around. (The best interface will be Olympus super control panel), but Nikon  is showing some progress.MOVIE RECORDING MODEMovie recording in D5000 is quite basic and easy to activate but tough to handle. To activate, you need to press lv (live view) button once, and then after you focus (you can half press the shutter button or manual focus) then you pres OK button to start and end recording. Them, you can now record the movie up to 5 minutes. The countdown will be displayed in the screen.It is tough to handle because there is no built-in stabilization so in order to stabilized the video you need a tripod. You will need to focus manually too to keep track of moving object because live view contrast-based auto focus is very slow and unreliable.However, compare to a regular camcorder, the movie mode are excellent in low light condition and able to create a very shallow of depth of field. You can also switches lenses to create different effects.COMPETITORSCanon EOS Rebel T1i 15.1 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS LensCanon T1i is D5000's arch rival in 2009.

Check out our own Nikon D3000 review.CONCLUSIONNikon D5000 is a feature-packed Nikon beginner camera that sits in the middle between beginner and advanced Nikon camera. It is a solid product with excellent image quality. The swivel LCD screen could be helpful for many situations. From features and image quality stand point, it matches Nikon D90. What hold D5000 back is its body interface and lack of built-in AF motor. Overall it is a good camera for your money. But before you get one, you need to check out its limitations especially about its lens compatibility and movie mode.Subjective Rating - Relative to entry level DSLR cameras 2009Image Quality : 5/5Features : 5/5Performance : 5/5Body and Handling : 4/5Value for Money : 4/5For sample images, ISO comparison and camera body pictures, please visit my blog.

We get to see what Nikon management is made of.  So far, I have to say, it hasn't been all that pretty.  For those of you who haven't noticed, Nikon is recalling D5000s for a problem with the power control chip.  On the internet, this has come to be known as \"Sudden Death Syndrome\" or SDS.  Based on the anecdotal public evidence available, it appears that the vast majority of affected units are not showing the symptoms (at the moment, at least), but that Nikon is taking the conservative path of replacing all the power chips.  So far, so good.  Beyond that, things are pretty bad.One major problem is that Nikon is being very close-lipped, and therefore not allowing customers to know the extent of the problem.  Based on the publicly available information, I SPECULATE that there are about 120,000 units affected.  Further, I guess that roughly 80k units have been sold to customers, and 40k units are in various stages of the inventory pipeline.So, retailers are going to take a bath.  I'm sure that those retailers with generous return policies are seeing *a lot* of D5000s bounce back.  I, for one, am very curious what will happen to those units.Most importantly, it currently *appears* that Nikon is Stonewalling, refusing to publish the range of serial numbers affected.  Instead, at least thusfar, Nikon appears to be trying to force this flawed inventory to be sold as \"new\" (which it is) and \"good\" (which it is not) and then shipped by the customer back to repair centers for chip replacement when the customer discovers that he bought a lemon.  Whatever the ethical arguments, I consider this to be very poor customer relations strategy, in that Nikon is attempting to dupe the customer into becoming an unpaid member of their value delivery system, taking on at least some liability for a product which is bad enough to have provoked a recall.Beyond that, this process will produce an enormous number of units which are for all practical purposes \"refurbs\", i.e. customer returns which have been reworked.  It is one thing for a customer to buy a unit and then suffer a random failure.  In such case, a warranty repair loads the majority of the burden on the manufacturer.  But, the customer is still left with a reworked and repaired unit, and the quality and life expectancy of such a unit is simply not as high as that of a good, \"factory fresh\" unit.  In the case of a random failure, this is the luck of the draw.  So be it.In the current case, the wave of returns will result in a huge number of \"gray\" units, which will either be sold (correctly) as refurbs, or palmed off as new units.I have some (fairly small) amount of sympathy for Nikon.  I personally have been in the business of chip design and vertically integrated electronics manufacturing for 35 years.  This problem is probably a subtle one generated either in a subcontracting design house or an Asian wafer fab. If you're Nikon, you've just been screwed.  But, of all the people NOT to blame, the customer is highest on the list.  I, the customer, didn't do anything wrong, other than the (apparent) mistake of buying a Nikon.In the long run, such behavior will only erode a leadership image that has taken decades to create.  Such behavior will cost Nikon in the long run, compared to taking the path of shielding the customer from Nikon's internal mistakes.  In the long run, the only beneficiary of the decisions will be Canon.***Update Aug 31, 2009.  It appears that the to-do regarding the recall is over, and that defect-free product is hitting the shelves.  Personally, I would make very sure that any D5000 I bought is over ser # 3168***, but that's just me.  Assuming you're just now starting to shop, I think the D5000 is an excellent entry-level dSLR.  Having owned both a D5000 and now a Canon T1i, I can say that they both take excellent pix.  Nikon strengths:  the kit lens is a bit better optical quality than the Canon, I think.  Reviewers claim the D5000's low light performance is better.  The digital signal processing feature set is richer (more options on exposure bracketing, for example...)  I have the impression that the Nikon is aimed at a younger crowd with less SLR history and more inclination to text.  The Nikon is laid out to have both thumbs pounding away at the menu choices.  Nikon weaknesses:  the articulating LCD is a mixed blessing.  It is good for taking that odd shot with camera held over your head or between your legs, but, seriously, how often do you want to do that?  With the hinge on the bottom, you can't use it tripod-mounted for self-portraits. And I fear that the LCD electrical connection through the hinge is one more delicate piece to quickly break.  I also thought the mini-usb connector was delicate.  Canon strengths: again excellent pix.  Canon has \"dumbed-down\" the interface and tried to make it more like a classical SLR.  You can still do almost all the \"gee-whiz\" stuff, but it is segregated into a \"creative zone\" setting.  The Canon LCD is much nicer looking.  No hinge.  To me, this is a plus.  The usb and battery connector and covers seem more robust.  The Canon bundled software is much, much better.  The Nikon requires you to spend $130 extra to buy these features a la carte.In the end, discounting the whole recall fiasco, I could be very happy with either model.  One last word to old SLR geezers like myself who think they're upgrading.  Both cameras have fairly dim \"penta-mirror\" viewfinders.  Manual focus is a chore at best.  To me this is the strongest argument to toss another $300 and get the D90. Also, both cameras have approx 16mmx24mm sensors, meaning you're throwing away half the image compared to 35mm slide film.  Both kits lenses are a serious compromise.  Both sensors are much better than the kit lenses.  If you're upgrading from point and shoot, you will be deliriously happy.  If you've ever owned a real SLR or a Hasselblad, you'll still be happy, but you will constantly be aware that these are \"entry-level\" cameras.", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon D5000 w/ 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6 G VR lens - what a nice DSLR for the money", "Author": "Thomas Arceneaux", "ReviewID": "RXXLXL8DTEHV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was an avid 35mm SLR Nikon owner/amateur photographer who put the SLR away when the digital point-and-shoot cameras hit the market and I succumbed to the simplicity and download ability of the digital SLR.  Besides, the little cameras took pretty good photos, at least that what I thought at first until more and more I found myself wanting to frame a photo a certain way, and it wouldn't do it.  Its all \"Auto\" and you get what the camera gives you.  Probably 75% of the time it was ok, but the other 25% were lousy photos and I finally got tired of it.When I started looking at the DSLR top sellers I was surprised to see that they had come down in price.  I looked at the Nikon 3000, then I looked at the Canon T1i, then I looked at the Nikon 5000.  I really liked the price of the D3000 (around $500) but when I compared it to the D500 (around $600), I was convinced that the addition of \"live-View\" viewfinder, and video capability was worth the extra hundred dollars.I ordered the camera in early December (Christmas gift to myself), I downloaded the owners manual, printed it (I enjoy reading in bed) and started studying the manual before the camera was delivered.  At first I was overwhelmed with all of the settings as described in the manual, but eventually, I realized that the camera was as automatic as you wish, or as manual as you wish, and any combination of the two.  I like shutter speed priority if I'm dealing with moving objects (slow shutter speed reflects movement; fast shutter speed reflects \"stop action\".  And I like aperture priority if I'm trying to control \"depth of field\".When the camera arrived I started playing with it and referring to the manual and I found that I could make sense of the different settings.  Fill flash had me puzzeled for a while, but I finally figured out how to turn that on and off.  Tonight, the night after Christmas, we visited \"Christmas in the Oaks\" in City Park (New Orleans) and I took many photos of lights with and without the flash.  Some of the photos are terrific.  I would have never been able to take any decent night photos with my point and shoot.Pros:  Price was extremely reasonable for a DSLR with zoom lens.  The live-view screen is large and easy to use.  Viewfinder is easy to use also.  Very versatile.  When the focus is right, and the light level is right, this camera takes great photos.  For the experienced SLR photographer, this is a really nice camera.  Feels great in your hands.Cons:  This is not a camera for the novice point and shoot owner unless you want to take some time to learn the differences between adjusting speed, shutter, zoom, existing light, flash, etc.  There are lots of dials, buttons, and viewing options.  Almost too many.  The totally manual mode is difficult to use, especially if you want to manually focus.  You must memorize what all the symbols mean when viewing through the range finder or the viewfinder.  In low light situations, the auto focus is extremely slow.  I read that its slower when using the live-view than when using the viewfinder.  When situations change, and you need to change settings from \"Scene mode\" to Auto, or to Shutter/Aperture priority, you have to remember which buttons to push and/or which dials to rotate.I think after I get more familiar with the camera, it will become easier to use and I'll be quicker.  I think the camera has the capability to do anything I want.....  I just have to keep learning.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Hands on comparison with T1i", "Author": "Voyager", "ReviewID": "REVCDEYJPV5ZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My research boiled down to a face-off between the D5000 and Canon T1i.  Initially, I was leaning toward the T1i but when I went to the local electronics retailer and compared them side by side the D5000 won out. There were just a few features that were not obvious to me from the written reviews that tipped the balance in favor of the Nikon.  Before we get into the details, just let me say that I'm not a pro - just an amateur, but have used a DSLR for a couple of years, and film SLRs prior to that.Layout/Design: The D5000 seems to have a better grip and button/control layout.  For example, the index finger can operate the on/off switch, and reach nearby buttons while resting on the shutter button.  The thumb can manipulate the command dial to select desired values for factors such as ISO, Exposure Compensation, etc. - all while you keep the finger on the shutter button.  On the T1i, you must remove your finger from the shutter button, select a setting button (e.g. ISO), and then move the command dial with your index finger. This just doesn't seem as good a design to me.Shooting Info/Status Display LCD: On the Canon, I noticed a lot of \"white\" space where no information was displayed and the values seemed to have random pattern.  Indeed, if you compare the exposure info layout to the predecessor XSi you will see several differences.  I also noticed that the T1i does not show several items on the main info display: Flash Mode (except in Creative Auto mode where it is ~apparently~ important enough to be displayed), Bracketing Mode, and Focus Points that are available on the Nikon.  Exposure Compensation is shown, but is less than obvious (its a small hash mark under the exposure meter). To me, flash mode (on/off/red-eye, etc.) is pretty important and should be always visible.  On the Nikon, every key bit of exposure info is displayed on the single shooting info display.  The layout is very uniform - the key settings are in the main area, and the less often used info is on the right and bottom borders.  The layout is nearly identical to other recent Nikon models.Auto/Scene Mode Flexibility: I discovered that the Nikon, unlike the Canon, allows one to modify many exposure settings even in the automated Scene (Digital Vari-Program) modes.  These include ISO, white balance, Auto Focus Mode, AF Area, AF Point, etc.  The only adjustment possible on most scene modes on the T1i is image size/quality (check the Function Availability Table).  I think this is quite a limitation, I think the ability to tell the camera that I'm taking a portrait but also override ISO, or auto white balance if I choose offers much more flexility and control.Auto Focus: Some reviews mentioned this but it may not be obvious to newbies.  In low light the DSLR needs to use a assist light to focus quickly and accurately.  The T1i requires the flash to be deployed for this to happen, while the Nikon has an independent focus assist lamp which is always available (unless manually disabled).  Most find this lamp to be less annoying than the Canon's flash strobe.Built-in Help:  When you are attempting to change an exposure setting, or menu option and forget what the functions does, etc. the D5000 has a help button that provides a pop-up explanation on the LCD display.  This is great for new to SLR users and even seasoned photographers when facing a menu option you haven't used in a while.  The Canon does not have anything like this.So, there are a few features that sold me on the D5000.  I've had it for about two months now and am very happy with it. The easy of use, speed, and picture quality has been superb in my opinion.  Hope this helps!", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for newbies and experienced users, Comparison with Canon T1i and other Nikon models", "Author": "Surgery100 \"ADJ\"", "ReviewID": "R2F0BRZ1MJ5T97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Strong feature set for the money. Excellent picture quality. Good lens kit (vibration reduction works great). Great camera for beginners and non-hardcore enthusiasts (Hard core enthusiasts might want to consider the D300s). Many automatic presets allow beginners to feel comfortable, easy controls allow creativity for more experienced users. Articulated LCD.Cons: No autofocus in video mode. No autofocus motor in camera body (on the flip side this keeps weight and cost down).Summary: Most common controls are intuitive and a small learning curve unveils the rest. The flip screen is a big plus, particularly in conjunction with the live-view mode which allows to frame and construct the picture without using the viewfinder. Very fast processor (same as in D90) and a 20 picture plus buffer allows for bursts at maximum resolution (maximum resolution and JPEG fine quality with a class 6 memory card allows 8-10 picture burst without decreasing quality, less if taking pictures in RAW format).The camera does not have an autofocus motor (like most in this class). While this makes the camera lighter and reduces the price, it also limits the autofocus lenses available (will only autofocus with AF-S or the more expensive AF-I lenses). Any Nikon mount lens is compatible, but if they are not AF-S or -I you'll need to focus manually. That being said, Nikon offers 2 great basic lenses with vibration reduction for under $250 each. Sigma and Tamron also offer a host of compatible lenses.The camera allows to shoot short (5 min) hi-def video (720). This is a nice extra, but keep in mind a couple of things, it will not autofocus after video capture starts, and the mic is quite poor. Again, a nice addition, but not really a strong feature.Among the three $1100 and less Nikon models, compared to the D3000, the D5000 has a much more robust feature set, faster processor and better resolution. It also shoots video and all this for about $125-150 more. Most certainly worth the step up. Compared to the D90, it has similar photo quality and features. The controls on the D90 allow for slightly easier selection, also the camera has an autofocus motor, and finally, it can autofocus even after capture has started. At about $350-400 more (around $1150) consider whether these features are worth the extra expense, but it seems like a big jump in price for a small jump in features (and almost imperceptible difference in quality).UPDATED 4-8-10I recently had the chance to play for a couple of days with the Canon T1i (my other finalist when I bought the D5000) and here are my comparisons between the two.Picture adjustments: advantage NikonThe Nikon puts the ISO, WHITE BALANCE and QUALITY adjustments in easy to identify screen commands, whereas Canon hides these in menus.Auto ISO: advantage NikonCanon does not allow for auto ISO in the pre-programmed modes.Smart reset: advantage NikonNikon has a smart reset feature which resets all the shot-to-shot stuff (ISO, WB, exposure compensation and AF sensor) after a shot with the push of a button. Canon forces you to go through the individual menus to do this a la pilot's checklist. If you don't, you may end up with funky white balance adjustments (yellow or deep tungsten hues) on some pictures.Flash options: advantage NikonNikon allows better control when shooting flash photos, for instance, you can select a slower shutter speed to allow more ambient light.  Also the Nikon has a signal when the flash may have underexposed.AF assist: advantage Nikon in low light, in good light evenCanon uses the flash to fire multiple shots in low light conditions to assist with autofocus, even when not shooting with flash, giving way to too many \"what was that\" moments.Image tweaking: advantage CanonNikon includes the view NX software which allows for some basic tweaking of pictures. For better control, you need to buy the View NX II for about $150. Canon allows for better controls for free at their picturestyle site ([...])JPEG file size and image optimization: advantage CanonCanon does a better job varying JPEG file sizes to maintain constant quality. Nikon tends to keep sizes very similar which often results in much larger files than you need. Not so much a problem for the card size given how cheap 4GB cards are now, but a bigger problem for the files stored in your computer.  I shot 400 similar pictures with each camera at their highest JPEG quality (1/4 compression), the Nikon folder was 1.71 GB, the Canon 1.26.Image quality: EVENI selected 10 pictures from each camera at random and printed them at 20\"x30\". No one in my \"panel of experts\" (read my family) could consistently say that one camera produced better images than the other.Final words: you simply cannot go wrong with either choice. They both have a long history of excellent lenses (in my mind the stronger factor determining which camera to get), fast processors, fast transfer speeds and more picture quality controls than most people know what to do with. The differences come down to ergonomics (which camera \"feels\" better in your hands and how easily you can access the buttons), price at the time of purchase and weather you already have lenses for one or the other.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Why spend more ?", "Author": "Gwenael Lepage", "ReviewID": "R2JYKNODO7KT1Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Every product has a market and trying to criticize the D5000 for slightly lower quality pictures when using ISO at 1600 or above when compared with more expensive cameras or talking about the fact that the continues shooting speed is more like 3 than 4 and not as fast as the D90 or higher models makes no sense.The sensor is the same as the d300, a camera 1000 dollars more expensive, even it autofocus is not available when filming, the simple fact that high res video recording is available is great for a camera at that price range.I have taken amazing photos with this camera, there is enough settings to play with to get great details and colors in different environment.If you don't need a camera for professional reason there is no need to spend one more dime than what this camera cost to get beautiful photos.", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "D5000: Solid mid-level Nikon DSLR", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "R31WKHL4QAWNT1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sometimes one can get carried away with sorting specs, reading pro and con reviews, making lists of what's important and not so critical.  This reviewer became guilty of that while trying to make up my mind which way to go in upgrading to a new DSLR. Yet what bumped me over the edge toward purchasing the Nikon D5000 was an analysis that I read online by independent reviewer and photographer Ken Rockwell, and in 2010 he said on his site: \"The Nikon D5000 is Nikon's best DSLR today, if size, weight and price matter. The D5000 offers the technical image quality of Nikon's best DX cameras like the D300s and D90, with the smallest size, weight and price.\" In the weeks prior, I had been debating whether to go for the Nikon D3000 or wait for the then-rumored D7000, but that cinched it fairly well when I read his words.Some of us have features we would like based on needs, and one of mine was a Vari-Angle LCD monitor, which I had experienced with the Nikon Coolpix P90.  Since the D5000 was the only Nikon DSLR at the time with that feature, that helped to narrow it down quickly.  We each have our priorities.I purchased my D5000 locally, a right deal at the right time that sometimes happens.  Picked it up with the Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens \"kit\" lens, as the almost-negligible difference in price made this lens worthwhile. Never thought that it would be that good, plastic mount and all, but it turned out to be a real gem. Thought that it might be just mine, but checking with other users, they have had great results with it as well.  It focuses closer (0.9 feet) than some of the more expensive Nikon zoom lenses (like the 16-85mm VR and 18-200mm VR lenses), it's smaller and lighter in weight, and the optical qualities are quite good.Before getting into this too far, for me the purpose of this camera was to have another vehicle, if you will, for the Nikkor lenses, which have proven themselves over the years.  In that light, the camera body choice means far less than the lenses.  As of the time of this writing, I've owned the D5000 for over 18 months now.  Colleagues and fellow photo enthusiasts have been complimentary at the quality of the images that I've been able to produce with this camera and its lenses.  Sparing you the technical talk, I spent many years in the photo equipment industry, have owned a number of Nikons and other brands going back to the 1970s.  I consider myself a 'professional amateur' or 'prosumer' if you will, and photography is an avocation rather than a profession.I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who has needed excellent quality results, but not wanting to budget for true pro gear, and this may be like you if you're reading this review. Rather than listing the pros and cons, I'll list some of the highlights that I've found during my experiences shooting and note taking.Handling/ErgonomicsThe ergonomics of the D5000 are truly noteworthy.  All of the main controls are located around the huge rear display plus on the right top, but the D5000 has no direct ISO-button. That's not as bad as one might think, as the [Fn]-button (look for it) can be customized to act as an ISO-button. The same applies to the missing white-balance as well as metering-mode and AF-mode button. This is one of the main differences between the Nikon D5000 and the control concept of the Nikon D90, where you'll find buttons for all regularly used functions.  But the exposure-relevant controls like shutter speed and aperture can be adjusted by the very convenient rear thumb dial.  Once you take the times to learn the layout of the various buttons and controls, you might find, as I did, that it's just the right balance. I have very average size hands, and everything seems to fall at hand quite handily, far more than the D200, which I used to think was very good.  And if the ergonomics are good, then you have more time to pay attention to the composition and less to fiddling with the camera.Body QualityThe relatively high build quality of the Nikon D5000 is based on a high quality plastic shell on an internal metal structure. The grip is rubberized with a thumb rest on the back just below the top-mounted command dial. In comparison to its bigger sister, the Nikon D90, there are a lower number of direct access buttons, but this is somewhat compensated by Nikon's first Vari-Angle LCD monitor.Sensor Dust RemovalDSLR sensors are quite prone to collecting dust due to the removable lens, so an important feature is some sort of anti-sensor-dust system. Nikon's dust reduction solution is based on high frequency vibrations induced to the sensor's low pass filter; this user found that it works reliably.BatteryThe included EN-EL9a Li-ion battery should last about 500 images on a single charge. Your results may vary. Use of LiveView may reduce this to 350 or 400 images. And the battery is backward-compatible with the Nikon D40, D40x, D60 and D60x.  I have purchased three additional batteries here on Amazon; you never know when you might need them.ViewfinderThis is larger and brighter when compared to other DSLRs in this price range. The specs say that it has coverage of about 95%, and the diopter correction is from 1.7 to +0.7. It has an advanced focusing screen display similar to the flagship Nikon DSLRs, and it's it's possible to superimpose grid lines, which can be quite helpful for accurate scene compositions. The amount of exposure-relevant information in the viewfinder is adequate but rather scarce: it shows not much more than the key exposure data, yet no info about your chosen metering or white balance mode for example.Vari-angle LCDCannot say enough about how handy it is to have the 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD, which proved to be invaluable from the first week that I had it.  This feature was good with low-angle shots and holding the camera overhead in crowds, as I had already found with the Coolpix P90, yet didn't have on the more costly D200. And it's nice to be able to flip the LCD closed to protect the screen when it's not in use. Must note that the newer Nikon D5100's 3.0\" Vari-angle LCD monitor is even better than that on the D5000. There is a difference in favor of the D5100, subtle as it may seem.Live ViewThe D5000 offers an optional real-time scene display via the camera's Vari-Angle LCD monitor display instead of the optical viewfinder. This live-view feature is one of the more intuitive ones but unfortunately it's not one of the fastest. After pressing the live-view button the display shows the scene with almost 100% coverage. You can also superimpose a grid for composition purposes, and you can zoom in or out of your scene by pressing the zoom-in/zoom-out button up to a magnification of over 6x... great for macro photographers.Focusing in LiveView mode is only possible via the so-called \"Contrast-detect AF\" which is not ideal as the LiveView on the D5000 can be very slow. It offers face detection and subject tracking, but the reduced contrast AF performance can be irritating. It's extremely slow, almost intolerable, when you're using it for action photography. For example, I was trying to shoot rapid sequence images of some black squirrels one day, and couldn't get a single decent shot of them while using Live View on the LCD screen. It's best to stick with the regular viewfinder in such cases.Live View mode seems to sometimes cause shutter lag, and it has taken over two seconds to focus often while the contrast-detect autofocus tries to get it together.  Fiddling with it, I found that it's made worse by camera movement.  Using a VR lens does have some positive effect, but not much.  Live view on the D5000 is best used on a tripod, where you can move the AF point around and let the camera do its work in a slow and steady fashion.  Beginning users should be aware that the D5000 focuses much slower in Live View than the compact digital camera that they're used to. Just adjust your expectations accordingly.Pop-up FlashThe built-in pop-up flash is TTL-controlled, and supports red-eye reduction as well as slow- and rear-curtain sync with a maximum sync speed of 1/200s. It's not overly speedy, but fast enough for this class of DSLR. The output can be adjusted in 1/2 or 1/3 steps from -3 to +1 EV, and it pops up automatically when taking pictures in automatic mode. There's a hot shoe for those who need more flash power.SpeedOperational speed is impressive. The D5000 powers up quickly without delays and it can shoot continuously up to 4 pictures per second. But in RAW or RAW/JPG mode the frame rate slows down after 11 frames in succession due to the limited memory buffer. The number of JPG frames is almost unlimited, though Nikon has limited the maximum number of continuous frames to 100. When using the \"Auto distortion control\" the number of continuous frames decreases dramatically, even in JPG mode.  Your results may vary, but test it first.AF PerformanceThe phase-detection AF speed and accuracy of the D5000 can be quite impressive, even in dark conditions, and the AF performance shows up in continuous AF mode as well.  If you're losing your target, the AF won't start to `hunt' all over the place.  But this user has found considerable AF lag while shooting indoors in low light situations, especially in Wide-area AF mode. There are times that the AF took a second or more to make a decision. It's good that the D5000 has an AF-assist lamp, but it really doesn't seem to speed things up much.MeteringThe metering systems offers special features ahead of those we're accustomed to from other consumer and prosumer DSLRs. Besides the conventional center-weighted and spot metering, you'll find the \"Active D-Lighting\" feature.  This is a useful function for high contrast scenes, and it preserves details in highlights as well as in shadows.  Active D-Lighting can be selected from Auto, Extra high, High, Normal, Low or Off within the on-screen menu, and delivers reliable images in combination with the evaluative system, even for those tricky scenes we encounter.White BalanceThe AWB (Auto-White-Balancing) system of the D5000 does a great job, but just like most digital cameras, it can struggles in artificial light conditions. It's prudent to go for a manual WB approach here, unless you use a flash unit.Lenses:The lack of an internal focusing motor in the D5000 does limit some lenses that you can use, even those from Nikon. Just because a lens is marked \"AF\" does not mean that if will autofocus on the D5000 and some other models, so check the specs carefully before buying. Cannot speak for any of the excellent third-party lenses (Tokina, Tamron, etc.) on the market today, but if the Nikon lens is marked \"AF-S Nikkor\" then it will autofocus properly on the D5000.Video FunctionalityNot a priority for this user, but the D5000 comes with movie functionality, and shows a user-friendly implementation of this feature. The motion JPGs (AVI-Format) can be recorded in three different sizes from 320x216px and 640x424px up to 1280x720px (=HD 720p), with a common frame rate of 24 frames per second. Taking videos with a DSLR may feel a bit strange but the results are well-above average and not comparable to the small, low quality movies from digital compact cameras.  But like most other DSLRs (other than the D7000 and some Canon models), the D5000 is no real substitute for a digital video camera. From this user's observations, there are problems with fast moving objects and poor sound quality. And there's no AF available during recording, though manual focusing is still possible. Video capabilities are not a reason to buy this camera.  If video is a priority or a serious choice for you, then look to the D7000.The Bottom Line...If you're familiar with Nikon DSLRs, at the first glance the D5000 seems to be a Nikon D90 with less buttons and a Vari-Angle LCD monitor. That may seem to be oversimplification, but to this user, that's as close a comparison that I can make.  This camera has the same CMOS sensor and feature packages that $1,200 - $3,000 Nikon cameras have.  You'll have to tweak and personalize your menu choices a little more on this prosumer, but the features are there. Once you familiarize yourself with the Nikon way of navigating and using the controls, this camera really is easy to use.Navigation through the menus to get to frequently-used settings used in the field (ISO settings, white balance, exposure compensation, and such) can be accessed fairly quickly and without too much poking around.Have used a number of DSLRs and bridge cameras over the past decade, and in terms of sheer functionality, must admit that I prefer the D5000 to the trusty and older Nikon D200, magnesium chassis and all.  At 19.8 ounces, the D5000 is lighter by almost 10 oz, whereas the D200 weighs in at 29.3 oz. This may not seem like much, but after carrying the camera around your neck for the better part of a day, even with a good aftermarket strap such as the Tamrac N45 Black Leather Padded QuickRelease Camera Strap , that weight difference does count. Also, the D5000 uses readily-available SD/SDHC memory cards, has more exposure and shooting modes.Any negative points that I have with the Nikon D5000 have to do with the shutter lag and Live View performance that have been listed earlier.  It's enough that this otherwise great camera is worthy of a 4-star recommendation rather than the five stars that I would have liked to award an otherwise great product. Even knowing that, I can conditionally recommend the Nikon D5000, but might suggest that buyers also consider the newer D5100, or the D7000.  These are excellent choices for beginners who want to step up to something better, enthusiasts looking to expand their photographic horizons, and pros already using D-series Nikons who need a backup body.I've found the D5000 to have great features, other than those noted, and is easy to use if one takes the time to learn its features and how to adapt them to your individual needs. I've had a number of digital cameras, and this one has spoiled me because of its perfect size, array of features, and ease of use. Remember that the camera doesn't take great photos. It's the photographer that does that, but to have the right tools, meaning the camera body and the right selection of lenses helps the creative process.

It failed exactly in the way of the 2009 recalled models exhibiting the same symptoms.  My unit was a brand new 2011 and the serial number was well after those under the recall.  Nikon refused to acknowledge any defect and is requiring me to pay shipping for repairs.  I wish my unit was one of the recalled ones--then at least Nikon would cover shipping.

It doesn't have the weather sealing that the pro models have, but where I live it doesn't rain!. The shutter is consumer grade but has now clicked 81,000 times and shows no signs of giving up.

With the 17-55mm attached it does feel out of balance with such a weighty lens, but again I have tended to use this combo only in the studio. Battery life has been extraordinary and I have often passed the 700 exposure mark before putting in a freshly charged one.

It's funny, but after all the reading (literally 100's of pages) it all came down to a simple visit to the store! I had a price point in mind - the main cameras I finally narrowed it down to were the D5000 and Cannon T2i (at the time with sales I had found they were within $100 of each other). Anyway, I had several 100's of pages of material I had printed and highlighted, dissenting opinions on both sides (Cannon vs Nikon) and I finally realized that both camera makers are great! There's no \"better\" maker, really - despite what you might read, both companies make GREAT camera products. So what finally pushed me toward the Nikon? 2 things: I know that I like to take indoor shots and don't like the way the pop-up flash makes my photos look so harsh. But I also know I will never use one of the huge add-on flashes (not often enough to really justify having it). Nikon makes the SB-400 flash - WAY smaller than the larger flashes and MORE than enough power for me (an amateur who wants great photos of his fast-moving kids and wife). A big heavy flash you never use is just as good as no flash. I was unable to find a comparable OEM flash for Cannon. Now, back to the deciding store visit!! I was back and forth trying to decide on which camera, driving my wife crazy with shutter speed, ISO, noise suppression and such when we decided to go a local store and see the two cameras in question. To the shame of the store, neither camera had power, but the actual cameras (not empty shells) were on display. Turns out, I didn't need the power on the cameras. As soon as I picked the cameras up and felt them in my hand, I was shocked at how better the quality/build/feel was of the Nikon. I really hadn't expected a difference, I almost didn't even pick them up when I saw they were unpowered. I can't really explain the differences in any quantitative measures. The fit and finish seemed better on the Nikon, there was less play in the dials, the buttons seemed firmer - It's hard to explain. Even the kit lens felt more solid - and it definitely looked better. You really need to compare them yourself. Once you've chosen, chances are you'll stick to that brand b/c of the investment you will have in your lenses.

The price has dropped on this camera making it an incredible value.  Unfortunately (for Nikon, not for me...) the camera's first production run suffered a recall, as you may know.  This has resulted in many never used \"refurbished by Nikon\" D5000's out there selling at sub-500 dollar pricing (body only). Same warranty, same everything, essentially new in the box.  What a great deal for a camera of this class.  I suggest getting a \"refurbed by Nikon\" camera if you can find one and save a Benjamen or two, along with the DX 35mm f1.8G lens - which is what I did, and bag the kit zoom.  Same camera, less money.  The D5000 camera is an underrated gem.  Image quality is excellent. Low light performance, superb.  I can't praise the 35mm 1.8 prime enough.  I'll take the articulated swivel screen all day long over the bigger screen with more resolution.  I often shoot at waste level or from lower angles, the swivel screen lets you do that.  Excellent!  Granted, one downside to focusing in \"Live View\" using the LCD instead of the VF is that it /is/ slower.  I don't find this horribly so, but YMMV.  I'm just really glad to have this capability period. The camera just \"feels right\" in your hand.  In fact, it also won the \"Red Dot Award\" for ergonomics  (Google \"Nikon D5000 Red Dot Award\" for more info) and won the DIWA \"Gold\" award for image quality. - So it's truly a camera that combines outstanding image quality with excellent ergonomics.  As far as video, it uses MJPEG.  Great! Since this codec can be edited in a variety of software packages, unlike some of the newer ones that are codecs optimized for display, not editing.  Love that it's 24p, and 720 is plenty of res (imo).  I actually /like/ how Nikon implemented their HD video and plan to use it often.  Just get used to shooting \"old school\" pre-autofocus days, since autofocus is disabled when shooting video.  (Great! No dizzying zooms that make you sea sick...)  Use of the Nikon glass and selective focus gives video taken with this camera a cinematic quality that is simply gorgeous - like the movies, that blows any camcorder I've ever used away. Just approach your shooting video more like you're shooting stills... Also, when shooting HD this camera tends to overexpose.  Set it about 1 stop down.

I have taken photography classes and my wife just wanted something with a faster frame rate, our toddler does not pose for us. This camera is amazing, so much it can do if you want it too and so much it can just do for you. My wife does not have the time to learn about all the things one can really do with this camera, but that's fine, since the auto and scene settings seem to do a pretty stellar job anyway. But for me, having the manual modes and ability to tinker, just like on my old analog SLR, is fantastic. Seriously. For those who always wanted a dark room in their own house, but can't afford the chemicals and supplies, getting a mid entry-level DSLR like the Nikon d5000 is the next best thing. An instant digital darkroom is at your disposal once you transfer the pictures over to your computer. But with a DSLR,you can really fine tune your image before you even take a picture, not just in Photoshop. I love being able to adjust the depth of field, white balance, film speed etc. It really makes even digital photography, something that is becoming less and less blasphemous to the photo purists thanks to great cameras like the D5000, a much more creative venture.Yes, the rear LCD display is a smidge smaller than other models and hard to see in sunlight, but same is true of the larger screens with better resolution in the sunlight. I like the ability to turn it around and protect the screen. When your done with your day of shooting, just use the LCD indoors to delete the blurries etc, before you transfer to your computer. You really would have to do the same with any other DSLR when shooting outdoors anyway. The price is great and you essentially get the technology from the higher-end D90 in a slightly smaller and more economical package.

Nice work Nikon!", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "I should have ponied up for the D90 but I still love the D5000", "Author": "Gadgety", "ReviewID": "R16VP0YO4WUF9Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like many who buy similarly priced models, this is my first DSLR. Also like many who are buying their first DSLR, I was looking primarily at Canon Rebels for no other reason than brand familiarity. Canon has done well for itself to completely saturate the point-n-shoot market so that people instinctively think Canon when it's time to graduate to a DSLR. Canon clearly spends more on marketing and I think it works well for them. I don't think there is anything wrong with Canon's DSLRs, but I'm glad I did my homework and bought Nikon. For others, Canon may actually represent a better value, but for me, Nikon was the way to go. First and foremost, Nikon has resisted the urge (unlike Canon) to squeeze as many megapixels onto their sensors. This must take tremendous willpower on Nikon's part because they have to know that many/most people still put a lot of stock into MP rating as if that alone has any indication of image quality anymore. But Nikon's willpower (as I refer to it) is important to me because lighting doesn't always allow for low ISO settings and this is where Nikon's current lineup have a very noticeable visible advantage to Canon's Rebels. If you look at comparison photos from reputable magazines and sites of shots taken at ISO 800 or higher, the Canon photos almost hurt to look at while Nikon's are quite useable. I also think Nikon's colors and brightness for its JPEGs are more realistic and natural than what the Rebel models put out.So, I have no regrets about choosing Nikon over Canon. My only partial regret is not ponying up for the D90. The D5000 (as you probably know) has the same image sensor and many of the same features as the D5000, but is cheaper. But for someone like me that shoots primarily nature, the D90 has at least two distinct advantages. The first is depth-of-field preview. This is a feature that is also useful for macro and other types of photography, but for nature shooting it would have been great to have for landscape shots. Sure you can calculate/estimate DOF using charts, cell phone apps, etc., but I'd really rather see firsthand what DOF I'm looking at. The other is the kit lens. The 18-55, while well-reviewed for being sharp, is just way too wide (even at 55mm) to be of any real use to me. I ended up selling it and buying the 18-105 (which comes with the D90). In the end, I probably spent as much as I would had I just bought the D90 to begin with. My advice to you is go to a store where you can try out a floor model to see if the 18-55 will really suffice for you at the longer end. The D90 also has auto-focus built into the body, but I really don't care about that because I don't have older lenses, and will not be buying used/older lenses. Most (all?) of what Nikon is putting out now is AF-S anyways. But other than no DOF preview and the too-wide (for me) kits lens, the D5000 is great and has lots of features. In addition to the 18-105, I also have the 70-300 VR lens. For nature shooting on a budget, this is the perfect combo for me. My next lens will be the 105mm macro lens and probably the 35mm 1.8 lens for candid low light/night shots. Then I'll be set!The swivel screen is cool, but I mostly like it for the protection it provides because I don't use liveview and really don't look at pictures I've taken on the LCD because they look so different on my monitor at home anyways. But for hard to get shots of flowers, bugs, etc., the swivel screen + LV is quite cool. And not using the LCD means I can take several hundred pictures before having to recharge the battery. By several hundred, I mean well over 500. There's a lot more I could write about this camera but it's not likely that it would be something you've haven't already read elsewhere. So, I'll just leave this review focused on how it has served my particular needs. My advice though...buy this, the D90, or wait a bit for the D90 replacement.

Hot pixels manifest themselves as red or white dots on your photographs and are caused by a defect on the sensor of the camera (they will appear in the same location every time).  These are very common and are generally unavoidable.  Typically, these are very hard to see unless you are at full magnification.  They are more noticeable under a higher ISO on a darker subject (sometimes they appear intermittently).My particular issue is severe since it can be seen on every photo taken, no matter the camera setting or scene.  Most defects are only 1-pixel large, but mine are 4 pixels together, which is a significant defect for a new camera out of the box.  Cameras will develop hot pixel issues over time, although none of my previous Nikons have given me this problem.Most sensors have pixel defects like this and they are typically \"mapped\" out before they end up in the consumer's hand.  Nikon does not provide a software mapping solution to the end user so it will have to be fixed under warranty.To check for hot pixels, it's best to take a photo with the lens cap on.  You'll need to manually set the shutter speed to force the camera to take a photo of a dark subject.  But if you haven't noticed them so far, I wouldn't encourage anybody to go looking since you are bound to find one.Assuming this defect is not a wide-spread problem, I am happy with the camera overall and would recommend it.  I purchased this instead of the D90 because of the articulating screen, a feature which is invaluable for some of the photography I do.

This includes almost complete sets of AIS and AF-D primes and a smattering of professional zooms (I've never been short of equipment).  However, I noticed that my D200 and professional zooms tended to sit on the shelf because they were too heavy to comfortably take on photo expeditions.  There was also the issue of complexity in the D200.  Of late, what I always seemed to have with me were the lighter and simpler to use D60 and the Nikon AF-S 16-85mm VR zoom.  After losing the D60 to an accident, I replaced it with the D5000.  I love it!  It's with me every day as I take walks in the woods.  (Contrary to what you might read, I have also successfully used the D5000 with AIS manual focus lenses and a hand-held light meter with excellent results.)  As features, I especially like the D5000's swivel monitor and the ability to see and change setting on the monitor rather than delve into layers of menus.  Using the D5000, I recently did a comparison between the venerable AIS 20mm prime lens and the AF-S 16-85mm VR zoom at 20mm.  It was a revelation!  The 16-85mm zoom beat the AIS prime hands down for clarify, sharpness, and chromatic aberration.  In short, when simplicity and easy of use matter, the D5000 + 16-85mm VR zoom is an impressive kit.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good entry level DSLR, but entry level is the key word", "Author": "Doctor C", "ReviewID": "R3TDJH1HVDEL15", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Some background, I owned a D40 and later upgraded to the D90.  I got a chance to play with the D5000 recently and have to say it's no D90.  Sure they have the same sensor and the image quality is GREAT especially in low lighting, but it's definitely not what I would call an upgrade for the D40.  A great replacement - much better than the D40x and D60 yes, but it's definitely in the same class as the D40 and you would probably outgrow it very quickly if you stick with photography.The only difference is that unlike the D40 which started out at around $500, the D5000 costs almost as much as a D90 and the D90 has MUCH more features.  If the price drops down to the current D40/D60 levels it would be worth it, but not the $850 it is right now.  Sorry.Things I like:great high ISO performance (low light for you non-photographers) - pretty much on par with the D90 and D300 and better than anything Canon has.The swivle LCD screen - although I'd be a little worried that it might accidently break offAutoFP flash -Although it's not the D40's true high speed sync, autofp will come in very handy with SB-600-900 flashes when you want to use a fast shutter speed when it's bright.  D40x and D60 did not have this.bracketing - missing from all the other D40 gen cameras11 AF points instead of the useless 3 on the d40/60What I don't like:NO AF MOTOR! that's what makes this an entry level Nikon in my opinion.  Sure all the new lenses are AF-S, but they also cost much more than the older gems out there.  In many cases you can't find an AF-S version of the lens anyway- like my favorite lens the 85mm f/1.8 AF-D.  Having lived with a D40 for a year, I can tell you manual focus is nearly impossible with these cameras.  You can live with it at first but trust me,  you'll miss this feature.No off camera commander mode:  Nikon has the BEST flash system in the world.  While AutoFP is a nice addition, you'll really miss CLS and the ability to remotely fire your flashes.No top LCD: The menus are logical, but there is nothing like the instant feedback you get from the top LCD.Camera is kind of small.  D90 and D300 are much easier to hold for a longer time.Not having the above features is not the end of the world, but again, this camera is only $50 less than the much better semi-pro D90.  If you're starting out, you might as well get the D90.  If the price drops down to $500 and you're on a budget get the D5000.  If you need a great started camera NOW and you're on a budget, look for a D40...there are many used ones at a great price.PS. with this recall business, I'd really stay away.", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sorely disappointed after two years", "Author": "P.

Its special features included in camera editing and better low light phtography.  At that time the Canon did not offer the same (now it does much better than Nikon).After a full year I have been tested by trial after trial.  The camera was recalled for a problem with the autofocus.  I tried to send it in but the process was at first unclear and customer service so opaque by phone that I continued to use the camera.  Usually the autofocus took much longer than it should have, and often it was impossible to take a picture.  This was always the case when using the viewfinder.I sent the camera to Nikon for repair.  The service process was a total nightmare.  I have compared my Nikon service experience to that of friends during the same period and we share awful experiences.  None of the representatives does what they say they will do (that is, find out what part of or when the camera is being repaired) and weeks go by without a clear response or knowledge of the process.  I called 10 times, with an average call length of 15-20 minutes (you can hardly get by with less), talking with non-native English speakers who clearly had no relationship with the service center or knowledge of past calls.  All said they did but you need to repeat the entire story so that they can understand just a little of the problem.Even today, months later, the name Nikon makes me nauseated.  My camera (body only) is for sale on EBay.  The service center was unable to provide details on what would be repaired in spite of my repeated attempts to explain (indirectly, through the nightmarish customer service center), and after months of waiting finally sent it back WITHOUT THE RECALL REPAIR.I have a graduate degree and belong to a photography club so I was amazed at the difficulty within an important company like Nikon to convey what for all of us is simple information.  When a camera is recalled one expects the process to be reasonably streamlined.  In my case (and many others) it is a real nightmare and waste of time.  The service center even \"lost\" my lens cap after returning the camera a few days after they expected me to have moved from the address they shipped the camera to!Canon, Panasonic, and so many other brands offer excellent and much better alternatives.  I hope that I can prevent another Amazon customer from having to deal with Nikon in the future.  If you can adapt your Nikon lenses to another camera (which is what one D5000 user that I know did) you should definitely do it.  I once had a wonderful customer service experience with Canon and have deeply regretted not purchasing from that company.I am hoping that someone at Nikon corporate headquarters has some knowledge of us poor folk (called customers) and of social media because I get sick at the thought of calling that awful company once more!

This is my first DSLR camera, enjoying it from the day I bought it in February 2010! you will instantly feel the difference in the photo quality from a point and shoot camera (actually there is no comparison). I researched a lot before buying D5000. I came down to D90 or D5000..with a cost analysis I ended up buying D5000..I'm glad I did. I wouldn't complain about D90 or any Nikon DSLRs for that reason.I saved about 500$ in D5000 over D90. I'm now planning to buy a prime lens with that money.I have no complaints about the camera so far.. very user friendly when you spend some time with it.. with little more time, you will start to love your photos and the photography!! video is good, I do not bother about it (truth is haven't effectively use the video yet..would rather go with my Canon HF200).Yes, you need bit more investment along with DSLR & standard kit lens(es).An extra battery is a must (you shouldn't take a chance to miss a great shot because of out of charge battery)..however, the battery life is good and as specified,An extra memory card (or high capacity memory card) would become handy with an extra battery.An external flash, wouldn't say a must, but great to have one. Built-in-flash works good, but you will know the difference in the indoor photography (sometime outdoor) with an external flash..say SB-600 or so. Don't forget the diffuser when you buy the flash, does a great job for a price of $7.A carrying bag..try to find one with extra lens compartment (s)..nice to have two extra lens compartments.Other lens cleaning items.. a cleaning pen with brush should suffice as a minimum. An air blower is a great addition to your cleaning kit.A prime lens is in my soon to buy list, probably going to buy a 50mm 1.4G AF-S..bit pricey, but seems to do a great job. This or any other prime lens will be a good addition when you learn bit more in DSLR photography. Kit lenses are good, but a prime lens will be great for portrait, indoor, and other day to day uses. I bought my D5000 with two kit lenses (18-55mm & 55-200mm). Now, if I were to buy DSLR, I would go with a prime lens and a telescope lens, say 55-200mm or so. Simply I would have skipped the short range kit lens saving some money. If it's a great package deal.. don't worry about it. No lens will be a waste in DSLR photography, especially Nikon lenses.I would really recommend D5000 to my friend, especially comparing other bit costly-end Nikon cameras. First determine how much you are ready to spent, then list the items (I would include an extra battery, memory card, external flash, cleaning kit..and may be a prime lens)..if you still have money left then move to D90, then D7000 (I hear good things about this new one).. Please note that if you got enough to pay at a later stage (in few years or so) and/or you have become very good in photography, you just need to upgrade your camera body..D90, D7000, D300 or even D3x! Nikon lenses are good with all Nikon DSLRs.Even then D5000 will be your day to day go camera!In summary, D5000 does everything an amateur photographer could do.. sometimes even to the pro level..trust me.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Chi-Hao Hu", "ReviewID": "R1WBFZKRC8IR7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying this is my first DSLR. I wanted to be able to take great pictures of my newborn + I wanted get into amature photography. DSLR have always seemed a bit intimidating but once you take the time to check out the features and read some of the manual (I'd be lying if I said I read the whole thing) it all comes together and the results are great pictures.Mine came with the 18-55mm and its definitely does a great job. I eventually added a 55-200mm and a fixed 35mm lens to my bag. The one thing to know about this camera when it comes to upgrading your lens is that the D5000 does not have an auto-focus motor IN the camera. You'll need to get a lens that has the AF-S motor built into the lens. This is a very important detail. If you're buying a lens, make sure it says DX and AF-S.The HD video capabilities have been a great and useful feature of this camera. I've taken tons of video of my newborn in 740p. Be sure to go into your video menu and actually select 740p. For a while I was wondering why my videos weren't looking so great. It helps to read the manual :)Another thing about recording video. You won't be able to auto focus while recording. You'll have to focus first, then record. Otherwise you'll have to set it to manual focus and adjust on the fly. I just record from a fixed position.For a beginner like me, the camera has a wide range of preset options from standard portrait, to pet portrait, food setting, sports setting and many more. It also has manual settings that you can customize. I'm glad to say I've moved from preset to manual in just a couple months.Overall, I have been completely satisfied with this purchase.

I knew NOTHING (and I mean NOTHING) about photography (F-stops, aperture size, and shutter speeds meant nothing to me 4 weeks ago), but with the great documentation provided with the D5000 (along with lots of great web-based tutorials) I was able to have intelligent conversations with much-more experienced photographers within the first week. Indoor pics are a challenge for the beginning (because it's all about light, light, light) but close attention to the features for the D5000 will help to make this much easier. Pictures that I thought would be difficult to make good-quality (like late night, long shutter shots) ended up being the easiest to create and the starter lens that comes with the D5000 takes great pics out of the box. Do yourself a favor, and use cambridgeincolour.com along with the (multi-lingual) User's Manual provided. You will be taking great shots in no time. I've learned how to take advantage of both deep and shallow depths-of-field easily with this little wonder, and the quality of pics taken with the Portrait-Setting will make any novice happy. Any photographer will need some patience, but be sure (if you first buy only the body) to get the 18-55mm and 55-200mm Nikkor lenses at a minimum. The long lense will expand your creativity several-fold. You'll find the D5000 runs seemingly forever on a charge of its modular Lithium-Ion battery (the battery is a real workhorse too, rated at over 1 Ah). You will love how the D5000 feels in your hand as well as the multiangle LCD display (that can be rotated to face into the camera to protect it, or rotated to sit inside the body, but facing out for easy continuous use). I'm told they sell LCD protectors so do yourself a favor (as I plan to) and get one, as well as UV filters (if not for utility's sake, then to protect your expensive lenses, since a $20 filter is a lot cheaper to replace than a $200 - or more - lens). The best advice I can give is, practice with this thing a lot, read the manual through (it's enjoyable reading though this is a complex little device) and share your shots with others to get an idea of how well you're doing. Oh, yeah, and get a tripod - it opens up a whole new level of picture-taking.

However, coming form a point and shoot world, the Nikon D5000 has proven itself to be an excellent entry point for me.Used to being able to slide a camera into my pocket, I was concerned about the size of the camera. However, the Nikon D5000 is very light compared to some of my friends' SLRs, and this makes the camera very portable. My first trip out was to the zoo, and I quick adjusted to the form factor and found it very easy to carry and use.  My only complaint in this department is the strap that comes with the camera. The standard Nikon strap was uncomfortable for me, and a bit cumbersome but that is certainly a matter of personal opinion so your mileage may vary.The Auto, and Scene settings will be familiar to anyone who has used a digital camera in recent years and result in great shots with very little effort. The real power of course is in manual mode, and even my experiments there have yielded some really nice results.All the various features can be a bit overwhelming. The manuals are just \"ok\" I'm afraid, so you woudl be well served to grab a book or one of Nikon's Camera School videos to help you along.

I\u00a1\u00a6ve had the camera for about 2 months and have shot over 2000 pics.  There will always be better DSLRs, but for the price at Amazon, it\u00a1\u00a6s fantastic.  I got the camera for $645 including the 18-55 VR lens, and the 55-200 VR lens for $120 more.  This is with tax and shipping included so this is equivalent to $700 + tax.  Show me a retailer or just about any online place that will give you both items for $700.One thing that everyone should do before buying is tryout the competition.  I tried out 2 Canons (XS, XSi) and 2 Nikons (D3000 and D5000).  I think both companies make great cameras.  The wonderful thing about major retailers like Best Buy and Sears, is that they will let you take them home and try them out and if you don't like them you can return them at no cost.  So I did.  I chose these camera since my ceiling on spending was about $750-$800 with tax for body and 2 lens so the D90 and T1i were out.So I tested each of these models and really preferred the Nikons for usability.  I\u00a1\u00a6m moving up from a super zoom Panasonic Lumix (a great camera for outdoors, but suffer badly inside with low light) and the Nikons seemed to be more like the Panasonic.  Additionally, most of my photography is of my kids sports (volleyball, basketball, swimming both indoors and out) so I needed something that performed good indoors as well as outdoors without using the flash.  The Nikons were more responsive on the shutter and at 4 frame / sec the D5000 was the best.  The higher ISO on the D5000 is great and much better than any of the other 3 I tested.  I really liked the D3000 as well but the higher ISO was something I really need for indoor sports.

The Video is ok, but I have only used it a couple of times. Easy to use menuing system with help on any screen.  A programmable button, live motion, flip out LCD screen.  It\u00a1\u00a6s lightweight for an SLR but bigger than a large point and shoot.Battery Life has been excellent.  I\u00a1\u00a6ve only changed it twice since the initial charge and I\u00a1\u00a6m at 2000 pics.  I don\u00a1\u00a6t use the display much and almost always shoot with the viewfinder.  Plus a lot of my shots are in burst so it\u00a1\u00a6s not using the much per shot.Storage capacity \u00a1V for an SLR I assume this is talking about the in camera buffer.  At the high JPG setting I have a buffer of over 20 pics so continuous shooting is no problem.  I\u00a1\u00a6m using and old Ultra 2 card (10 MB/sec) and that is plenty fast.  Even if when shooting RAW + JPG, I\u00a1\u00a6ve got a buffer of about 12 photos so its not an issue.  I love continuous shooting for sports but rarely need to capture more than 10 in row.  That\u00a1\u00a6s nearly 3 seconds of photos and eternity in sports shooting.Software \u00a1V They ship a simple editor that does some RAW processing but I\u00a1\u00a6m fairly new to this so I can\u00a1\u00a6t say much.

It does fall into recall and I sent it few days ago. So far it has been working flawlessly and I have taken more than 2000 pictures. I did fair bit of research including reading all professional reviews and comparison with peers especially D90 before shelling out 800$. Its picture taking capability is nearly identical to D90 based on several professional reviews. The only difference is that it does not have depth of view finder or internal focus motor. Battery life is awesome and I have taken more than 500 pictures on single charge. Active D lighting options, Bracketing, 11 point AF & 19 scene modes are all great options. Portrait mode works great both indoors and out door. Party mode is great to capture effects of indoor lighting and I have taken pictures side by side to see the difference. I have used this camera with 18-55, 55-200 and 18-250 sigma lens and it has produces some great results. I am confident that Nikon will not screw-up their reputation on one camera even if they end up taking loss on it to satisfy customers.

I consider myself a professional amateur if-you-will -- a professional graphic designer (design magazines and print materials) who knows the impact of good images for my work.I'm going to write this from the perspective of someone who needed excellent quality but not the budget of pro equipment -- could likely be you too if you are reading this review.PRO's:- This camera has the same CMOS sensor and feature packages that $1,500-$3,000 Nikon cameras have.  You do have to fiddle and personalize your menu choices a little more on this consumer/pro model, but the features are there.  I highly recommend kenrockwell.com.  He has a FREE user's manual online for this camera (good ole common sense, not over-your-head talk).  He walks you through key features and settings you need to know.  He also shares things he considers gimmicky and unnecessary on the camera.  Best two hours I have spent online getting to know my camera better -- paid off big time in the field!- Once you are used to the \"Nikon\" way of navigating and using controls, this camera really is a dream to use.- This camera can use the DX model lenses that have auto-focus built into them.  Most newer lenses from Nikon are compatible with the D5000, and the older glass will fit, but many will have to be manually focused.  Be aware some third party lenses (Tokina, Sigma, etc...) will not have the internal motors necessary to auto-focus -- more below in CON's...- Navigation to get to the main settings used frequently when in the field (white balance, ISO, exposure compensation, etc...) can be accessed relatively quickly and with not too many clicks...- Battery performance impressive.  I shot 1,200 shots in continuous mode recently at a graduation event.  Didn't have to change batteries once.  I did buy two  back-up batteries on amazon that I keep charged just in case I need them in the field.- No question about it -- this camera will produce professional grade pics that will knock your socks off.  This really is all the camera that 95% of people will ever need!- Nikon resale value is excellent.  The better bodies and lenses hold, and in some cases appreciate in, value!- The BEST camera you are going to find for the money. Period.CON's:- The lack of internal focusing motor in D5000 does limit some lenses that you can use.  I'm a wide-angle junkie!  I would have loved to have acquired the Tokina 11-16mm wide angle lense on the market today (getting amazing reviews), but because the D5000 does not have the focusing motor, I would have to manually focus the lense for each shot.  For my event assignments, not always practical.  I got the 10-24mm Nikon lense instead -- and people have been amazed with the results.  I'm still very happy, but you should be aware that you will be limited by some choices because this body hits the \"consumer/pro\" category.- I don't find the rotating, swivel LCD screen to be especially useful.  You might.  I keep it locked in with the LCD pointing out for image review and menu navigation all the time.- Video capabilities is not a reason to buy this camera.  Not Nikon's market, and it shows.  Can't autofocus in video mode...kind of gimmicky really.  Used it once, was not impressed.  But not why I bought the camera either.- Feels a little small-ish in my hands.  I'm 6'1\" male, 200 lbs with proportional hands to match.  My next camera will likely be the D7000 (apparent replacement for D90).  I think it will fit my hands a little bit better, but I can't complain; I'm getting great pics and it's not uncomfortable, just slightly small for my particular hands.  The next step up in size and quality Nikon bodies (internal focusing motors, for one) are also a significant step up in price!BOTTOM-LINE:I'll put images produced by my D5000 up against images out of a D90, D300, and even D3 any day of the week.  Spend your time on the art of photography and not so much the technology, and you'll be surprised where your affordable D5000 will take your photography skills.  I've invested 4 years with a D50 and now D5000 and am so glad I did.  I have next steps mapped out and a wish-list, but I am content with where my photography has come.  It has become a real passion for me!  Along those lines I HIGHLY RECOMMEND \"The Art of Photography\" by Bruce Barnhaum.  Available here on Amazon! Long considered the bible for photographers.

I had every intention of getting to know the features better and I maybe use this camera at 10% of it's capacity, but even then I've been really happy with this purchase.I take daily photos with my D5000, mostly of my newborn daughter, and this camera takes amazing quality photos.

The camera was easy to pick up and start using, but it is also easy enough to learn to start customizing your shots for different situations. I'm impressed by the camera's ability to help a beginner by auto-selecting some settings while allowing the photographer to manually select other things. The kit lens is a good starter lens, and works for most of the situations I've shot in so far. I'm still learning what this camera can do, and I'm excited to know that the D5000, with its advanced features, can grow along with me as I develop as a photographer.In terms of size, I have small hands and I feel like I can comfortably carry around the D5000. Yes it is bigger and heavier than a point and shoot, but it's not so big that its cumbersome for me to carry. Which is a good thing, because I've started carrying this camera everywhere because I always want to be able to capture that perfect shot!If you're transitioning from a point and shoot to a DSLR and you want something with great features that still is easy to use, this is the camera for you. I couldn't be happier with my D5000--when you get that crisp shot of a kid opening presents or a beautiful bride coming down the aisle, it's so worth it to have made this investment!

I have for years(the last two) used a Canon Rebel XTi, all with severe disappointment.Not that Canon makes a bad product, it's just that this model didn't hold up to the Canon standard and was loaded with exposure problems. Those problems were verified on numerous forums.Now enter the Nikon D5000 and Ashton Kutcher in the Nikon fashion runway ad. I was immediately impressed with the drop down monitor and was curious as to how well it worked. Nikon is synonymous with quality on all fronts, how could you go wrong? That's what I thought about the Canon. So this time it was going to be research, research. Long story short, this is a great camera. Easy to use, a tad bulky to hold, but you get used to it, and great photos. I also ordered the 55mm-200mm telephoto lens.  This camera is all they say it is and more. While I understand the Nikon D90 is a little more high end, this D5000 has a few more options than its D90 cousin.If you are looking for your first serious Digital SLR camera, this is it. The monitor display is true in color, and the picture quality is phenomenal. The multiple settings are an amateur photographer's dream. Talk about taking the guess work out of a photo shoot. So if you are in the market, and can't make up your mind, give the D5000 a trial run at your local photo shop reseller, or wherever you physically shop, that's what I did, and that clinched the deal. Seeing is really believing when it comes to making such an investment.

You get the same quality as the D90 minus a few futures.  Big deal.  I'm more concerned about the picture quality.  Which I must say is awesome.

I like this camera.  It is  more complicated than I realized but then again I am making the transition from film-takes me a long time.  Once I got a few things figured out, like the fill flash and my hat bill tipping down the flash and having to set it on P to adjust, pics came out much better than I had hoped.I spent about 2 plus hours on a plane just reading the manual.  Now I knew all it could do, still didn't know how to do it though.  After another three or so hours scrolling through all the settings etc with the book in hand, I had a better idea what all the buttons do.  After first day of shooting and still playing with all the settings and becoming more familiar with what works what I finally had enough figured out to shoot simple shots.It will take some time with this camera.  It is not as hard as I first thought, just a lot more to it.  This camera has a lot more than I realized and the pictures are extremely sharp and excellent color rendtions.  Finally stumbled on a screen where I can even adjust the colors just enough to get a little different tint to them.  Nice feature.I am sure there is a lot more I will find in this.  Camera was shipped from Electronic Expo with expidited shipping so I could have it before I left on a trip.  Camera arrived right on schedule.Overall, I am happy I got this camera.

I took some photography classes when I was young and consider myself reasonably proficient in the use of a traditional SLR. For the last 6 years my main camera (and first digital camera) was a Nikon Coolpix 5400, which I bought because it offered some of the features of a DSLR (exposure controls) at a more affordable price. When upgrading, I briefly considered going for another Coolpix model, which undoubtedly would have performed better than my old one in many ways, and would definitely be less expensive than a DSLR, but I decided I really wanted lens interchangeability. I also considered the other non-SLR, interchangeable-lens options in the same price range as the D5000, such as Micro Four Thirds and the new Samsung NX-10. Those would have offered basically everything I was looking for, in a slightly lighter and more compact package, but ultimately I decided to go with the D5000 because it's based on a proven design and has a lot of lens options. I couldn't be happier with my decision.The most obvious differences compared to my old Coolpix are the outstanding battery life (hundreds of pictures with and without flash and I still haven't run the battery down all the way yet), and the fast autofocus and quick turnaround time. In the past I've missed many good shots of my kids because of the sluggish autofocus on my old camera. Even if you never learn how to use all of the features on this camera and just leave it in auto mode, the picture quality is well worth the extra cost and bulkier camera compared to a compact.Update, October 2010:About two months after I bought the camera, the built-in flash quit working. My experience with Nikon tech support was good, and they were able to repair it. (Nikon did not charge for the repair, but I did have to ship it to them at my expense). I've had no other problems since and I still don't regret buying this camera in any way.

Boston", "ReviewID": "R2TP2VBWNWS5BK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In my teens and early 20's, I had an Nikon SLR that was practically attached to me, I took it everywhere. I pondered going to college for photography, so it was a serious hobby for me that I've been missing since the advent of digital photography. I've had a variety of great point and shoots, but they never gave me the control of my old Nikon.I did a lot of reading up on the various models and found an easy to read comparison chart on the Nikon site. While I was drawn to the D90, I found the D5000 was very nearly the same thing, for at least five hundred dollars less. The only difference that stood out to me was the D90 had 4.5 frames-per-second, D5000 had 4 frames-per-second. The D500 has the awesome vari-angle LCD screen and I knew I'd get some great use out of that. The downside was it wouldn't auto-focus with my old lenses(I believe because there is no built in AF motor in the body of the D5000), but that wasn't a huge deal breaker for me, being I usually like to manually focus anyway.I got the D500 as a surprise for Christmas(you know how sometimes you put ridiculous things you know no one will buy on your Amazon wish list?!)and haven't put it down since. And the super awesome part? You can take as many pictures as you want and you don't have to develop film. Plus, there's the added bonus of being able to manipulate your digital images in a photo program, which I was never able to do with my 35mm camera.All my old lenses(sigma, etc) work wonderfully, but the lens it came with is multi-purpose and easy to use. I'm a big fan of macro and found I could get quite close with the standard lens(18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens) that came on the D5000. The camera has bells and whistles galore, but out of the box, it's easy to figure out and begin. The more you use it, the more you figure out what you like, and all the cool things you can do with it.I do love the settings such as beach/snow, pet portrait, dusk/dawn and candlelight, though I'll mostly stick with manual mode. But those setting are perfect for the moments you just need to get the shot and don't have time to fiddle around.The pop up flash works well, though I hope to get a speedlight eventually. The vari-angle LCD is shockingly cool. I'd never know I needed one if it wasn't offered, but once you get used to it, you'd never be able to live without it.Some interesting,diverse options for in-camera editing, like adding fish eye after you've taken the photo! When I was younger my fish eye lens was one of my favorites, now it's almost an unnecessary lens to lug around. Otherwise, I like to do most of my work on a larger screen, and so far have been loving the Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo x2 Ultimate. I really get into photo restoration and also just doing fun color/hue/contrast manipulations of my digital images. That software is very easy to learn and gets the job done.Overall, there's nothing I've found about this camera that I don't like!!

WHICH IS A GOOD THING, not a bad thing. You can still take GREAT photos never touching the manual but most people buying an entry-level/upper-entry level dSLR may not realize just how much their camera really can do!

The quality of picture is fantastic; I can most definitely tell the difference between this and my old Panasonic and Canon point-and-shoots. HUGE DIFFERENCE. It performs well in low light, as many people have mentioned, and the lens that comes with the kit is very versatile. It's overwhelming, the number of options on the camera, and I can tell it'll take a while to fully understand each of them. Some people have complained that autofocus in live view takes a while, and it does, but for me this wasn't a huge issue. The fact that the live view screen flips out is very cool, and though I haven't found much use for it yet besides self-portraits and protecting the screen, I can tell it's one of those features that you will be immensely grateful for when you need it.

We got it mostly to take pictures of the kids and their activities, for something that would work better in all light situations.So far, it has more than exceeded our expectations.The picture quality is amazing. Even on the automatic settings with no intervention from us, the pictures look professional. The included lens has a very good zoom range, perfect for most room size settings. The lense autofocus works fast as well.We experimented just a little so far with the adjusting settings manually. Probably the most useful thing to learn to use is the white balance settings, as we do find that our pictures especially in flourescent light come out better if we set the white balance to the right light type manually.The menus and settings are easy enough to use and learn, but I'd recommend you get a digital field guide kind of book Nikon D5000 Digital Field Guide for the camera to learn the features and see some color examples.We especially like the burst mode shooting. Depressing and holding the shutter release shoots around 10 frames a second, very useful when trying to get that perfect picture of the kids.Battery life is excellent as well. We've already taken several hundred photos in just a few weeks (that burst mode does contribute to shooting a lot of frames), we've had the LCD screen on for most of those, used the flash for many and the battery is still nearly full charge.The camera feels like it's built to last too. While it's not part of Nikon's \"professional\" line, it feels like something we as average consumers can be confident should last 5-10 years.We also purchased a longer zoom lense as part of a bundle deal with this. Amazon frequently has deals with this Nikkor 55-200 or other similar lens with the camera. So far I'm really impressed with the shutter speeds I can get with this lens.

This website goes through each of the cameras settings, gives you an in-depth detail of the camera, what the Pros & Cons are, how to use it, what type of pictures it can take, compares it to other cameras and so much more.  This website really helped me decide because reading some of these reviews on Amazon.com scared me quite a bit.After I got the camera I was playing with it for hours trying to figure out if I could recreate some of the issues these people had.  I found an issue that I read earlier in one of these postings about the Autofocus feature turned off.  There is actually a setting that I personally changed that affected the camera's autofocus even when the AF was switched to on, on my lens.  After reading the book I had it fixed in just a couple of seconds!I then compared the camera to a Cannon RebelXLT that I had purchased a couple of years ago.  I know the technology has changed, but when I was on the hunt for a new digital camera I wanted to look at all angles of brands.  One of the first things I liked compared to the Cannon was the view finder.  I'm not too sure why but my eyes always had a hard time trying to Manual Focus with the Cannon.  With the Nikon the viewfinder is tinted slightly and that is just enough tint for my eyes to recognize what is focused and what isn't.  Not only did the Nikon beat the Cannon in the focusing arena but more so in photography studio shooting as well.  I work for a company that manufactures aftermarket parts for the Hot Rod & Street Rod Industry.  I have been using the old Cannon for all of my shots until I received my Nikon.  I took one shot of our products with both cameras and the Nikon by far and hands down took a better more clearer picture.I am very pleased with my purchase and I can't wait to try all of the other lenses that are made for this camera.

If you are new to SLR/DSLR and looking for a entry-level DSLR to begin with, then Nikon D5000 will give you Nikon D90 or Canon T1i picture quality for only little extra $ on top of entry entry DSLR Nikon D3000 or Canon XS.  I really believe the extra $ is well spent for the picture quality coming out from Nikon D5000 especially in low light condition or indoor.  A lot of people against it due to missing build-in moter to AF the non-CPU lens,  which is not really a major issue to most of the new entry DSLR users if they do not have old lens on hand.  In adiition, there is no reason that the D5000 LCD is not good enough if all Nikon D3000/D40/D60 and Canon XS/XS1 LCDs can provide you good picture viewing results.  That's why the lower resuolution LCD display than D90 and T1i display LCD is not bothering me too much.  However, the picture quality is much better than Nikon D3000/D40 or Canon XS/XSi and even up against Nikon D90 or Canon T1i picture quality, which is the super value come and shine from D5000.Please check dpreview.com and see the Canon Rebel T1i review.  The professional reviewer even mentioned the Nikon D5000 provide great picture quality even compared to Cannon T1i.  You cannot go wrong with D5000 unless you have a lot of older lens from previous SLR/DSLR needed built-in motor body or you are using more D90 features instead of P&S; replacement, then D90 might be better way to go.Otherwise, skip Nikon D3000 or Canon XS/XSi and go for Nikon D5000.

No recall issue in Nov", "Author": "WaterEarthSky", "ReviewID": "R2E8FI3O0I9KCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this in Nov from Amazon and they are not in the recall numbers.I have also bought the Nikon 18-200mm VR2 and they make a very very good combination. This will be my everyday camera for all occasion.Why I bought the D5000 over D90The D5000 has the same image quality as the D90/D300 (same image sensor), share the same picture control & ADR but in a lighter & more compact for traveler like me. It is also the quietest SLR camera. That swivel LCD is the main reason I bought this camera.I travel a lot and getting a small camera is a must, frankly I prefer the D40 size but went ahead cause of Nikon Gen 2 features (especially the ADR). I take all pictures in Aperture priority mode & was a pain to get used to (No top LCD) but I got use to it eventually and had also swapped AE lock to ISO control.The fun part of this camera is the swivel LCD. This feature removed the tripod when traveling. I can now take pictures of myself & friends by reversing the LCD & snapping away with one hand (I use to do guess work & nobody like to repeat their smiles for 3-4 times). I can now snap people in trains, restaurant, pubs w/o pointing in their face.  I take my time to compose such shots. No more paparazzi style & no more crawling and kneeling down for macro shots. It really feels like those old cameras where you look down and take pictures -- a refreshed way of taking pictures.The grip is good enough to start snapping away with one hand. However pro photographer may not like the feel of it especially if you are coming from bigger camera like D3,D70.I really like the gen 2 in camera processing, It makes the colors pop. I set saturation & sharpness all the way up for landscape and neutral for portraits. I really like the result. I am spending less and less time on post processing. The ADR is also superb. If u are taking pic inside train tunnel, U will be able to capture the texture wall of the tunnel. Its closer to what our eye see things. Older Gen 1 will only see the light at the end of the tunnel, everything else is black. No more burning & dodging. ADR can aslo be turn off.There is not much direct control button, but its good enough for me, I only need ISO and Aperture. Everything else has to be change from LCDs. I feel like returning it initially but somehow I got so use to it that I can change settings as fast as the direct buttons. I will describe the learning curve like dialing phone numbers. Once u get used to it, u can dial 10 digit in 3 sec. I always knew Nikon has a way to make it work.I am also quite impress by the speed. I don't mean the speed in continuous snapping (which has an impressive 4fps by the way), I mean the speed in powering it up & shooting right away. I had the impression that it might be slow due to the leans cleaning each time its power up. I was wrong. There was no delay at all. I am able to pull out the D5000 from sling bag, power it up, shoot, power off & put back in the bag in a single swing motion with one hand. Much like Hollywood cowboys pulling guns out. This is important when traveling to foreign land where hanging it on my neck like a tourist is not an option.ConsThe live mode is very slow  ..much slower than point and shoot. Takes 4 secs to focus. The Video mode is completely useless & I really mean it. Its jerky & had no auto focus. The problem is, I only have 2 hands. Left hand on manual focus, right hand to control zoom, so who is holding the camera? assistant cameraman?  Wish there is top LCD for changing aperture.Despite all the down side, this camera is really a worthy buy in terms of $$ for the image quality.

I was considering the d90 (the low end of the professional spectrum) but decided on this one based on price. I can say, having used both this camera and the d90, for the amateur or semi-professional the biggest different was in the feel of the camera. This camera feels a bit cheaper than the d90, the body just has a lighter plastic feel that results in a somewhat unbalanced feel with the lens on. The other difference, and this may or may not be a big one, is that the d90 has a motor in the camera for focusing the lens whereas the d5000 does not, so any lenses you want in the future will cost more and weight more if you want the autofocus feature (again unbalancing the feel). Now onto the unique features of this camera.The fact that the LCD screen flips out and turns is not a feature I thought I would use. However it's immensely useful when you need to take photos at a weird angle, say over a crowd at a festival. I also have used it numerous times for product photography when my head would get in the way of the light while the camera wouldn't. Or for sneaking up on animals outside. It's a very useful feature. And even better is that you can flip it around and lock it into the camera protecting the screen from scratches. If you have no choice but to put your camera in a bag with scratchy things this is a lifesaver. It also means you don't have to impair the quality of the screen with a cloudy plastic cover. I love the flip screen. More cameras should have this.Many DLSRs in this range do not have video capabilities, but this one does. It takes extremely high quality videos (much more so than my dedicated camcorder) and is a great video camera. I've used this to videotape things for art shows that came out just amazingly. Crisp, with good colors and the sound quality is surprisingly good. I liked it so much that I have now turned my camcorder into a glorified USB stick.The flash on this camera is nothing to write home about. If you're serious about photography, no matter what camera you buy, you're going to need a separate flash. Even a cheap one is fine. This works as a fill flash when you're just walking around not wanting to lug around a ton of camera equipment.The auto white balances are very good on this camera outdoors, but like many cameras needs a little tweaking indoors. But once you set the correct one, it works great even on the auto setting for the type (say auto fluorescent, auto cloudy, etc...). It was surprisingly good at guessing. It was also extremely easy to fine tune the white balance by hand, say if you want warmer sunsets and sunrises or a greener look in a forest etc... I love how easy it is to navigate through the menus, everything is straightforward and labeled with helpful icons. I vastly prefer this menu interface to the Canon one. It's fairly intuitive to find things and everything is grouped and color coded. You can also choose to add effects like sepia, any sort of color toning, or black and white after the picture in the camera. If you don't have a program such as photoshop on your computer, this is a useful feature (though getting any kind of photo manipulation software is probably a good idea). You can also combine images for a double exposure in camera, along with several other features such as fish eye and such.This camera performs surprisingly well in low light situations. I was impressed with how well it handled shake and movement. It was obviously grainy at a high ISO, but it also took the picture so you weren't left with a blurry, grainy mess. One problem I experienced with the camera was that it was very bad at metering through a polarizing filter. I set it on auto while I was doing my field work since I only had a few seconds for each picture and was extremely disappointed to see that despite it being a very sunny day, the pictures had been taken on an unusably high ISO. It's my fault for not setting it myself and while I expected some of this, it seemed much \"worse\" than with other cameras.It is extremely easy to use this camera as a point and shoot. You don't need to be \"making art\" to get a lot of this camera. You can set it to P or to auto and turn on the autofocus and it's basically just a very high quality (and much bulkier) point and shoot. This camera is useable by anyone for a wide range of purposes and skill sets. Obviously if you're a serious full-time pro, you'll want some of the features of a higher end camera. But for anyone who doesn't do elaborate photo shoots on a regular basis, this camera is ideal.This camera is very, very easy to use and straightforward. You can get great pictures right out of the box and all you really need to know to do is press the shutter button. It's very easy to figure out more complex functions. They do a great job of both packing this camera with useful features while at the same time making it easy to ignore these functions and just get shooting. Frequently high-feature electronics means so many options and adjustments that you can't just make the thing work. That is definitely not the case with this camera.The kit lens that comes with this camera is very good for a kit lens. I use it frequently as my all purpose walking around lens. The autofocus is fast and smooth, as is the zooming. The images are crisp and sharp and I have no complaints. It's also worth noting the camera and kit lens are very durable. I took this camera to do field work and stupidly dropped it twice on extremely hard rocks and both times it survived without visible damage.Overall, I am extremely impressed with this camera. I was unable to see any difference in image quality between this camera and the more expensive d90 (which makes sense as they have the same sensor).

And I am writing this review after using it for over a year. I upgraded from a Canon superzoom and therefore at that time, this was everything that I was looking for.I chose Nikon over Canon at that time for two reasons, because of great ergonomics and superior optical quality of its lenses. However, now I think these differences do not matter much, it is possible to make good photos with both. I make good pictures when I travel, when I am on the move. That's my secret.Now after a year of owning the D5000, I have outgrown the 18-55mm kit lens and shoot mostly with the awesome Nikon AF-S 35mm f/1.8G lens. The D5000 itself is a great camera. If I was buying a new DX body today, I would go for the D7000. As a owner however, I am not considering trading this up for a D7000, because I can still take as good a picture as I could probably manage with a newer Nikon.My advice to anyone getting into photography with a Nikon would be to ditch the kit lens and get the AF-S 35mm f/1.8G for DX or AF-S 50mm f/1.4G for FX.

As far as DSLRs go, this is a pretty easy camera to operate, though, for someone who is used to only point and shoot cameras, you may find that it will take a little bit of time and reading before you can use your camera to the fullest potential.  I recommend picking up a guide for this camera if you are not a frequent SLR or DSLR user!  Overall, the price is great for what you get!

I missed so many shots of him because shutter lag that I decided to get a \"better camera\" with out breaking the bank in the attempt.I went with the \"middle of the road\" approach which means finding a decent camera between SLR's and point and shot camera ...big mistake. None of those middle of the road cameras did the job.After some attempts and returns I decided to go for the D5000. I wonder why I did not do that to begging with. The quality of pictures is simply amazing, no shutter lag at all, easy to handle and use. At least in my experience I found the controls natural and in the right place.I took the thing to a Renaissance fair where I shot still subjects with bright colors, landscapes (castles, dungeons) or action themes; knight fights scenes, horses running, kids playing around, all shots came out great does not matter if there was bright light, low light, shade etc everything came with vivid colors, not blurry images I have not need to retouch the shots adding more light or playing with the color in Photoshop. Everything just came out perfect with the camera just out of the box. I did not even have the time to read the manual but it was so easy for me that I don't think I even need to do so except for advanced stuff.The seatback if you can call it that is that when you are use to a small \"point and shot\" cameras a SLR feels bulky and hard to carry but the quality of the pictures & taking advantage of all the features offset that seatback & does not become an issue at all.I am not a professional photographer by no means just a regular user. I just want to take good shots of my very active two year old and some landscapes and family pictures. I just hate the shutter lag thing from the point & shot cameras.I went to the Nikon web page and check out the recall that some users complain here my camera is not in the recall.So far this is the best camera I have ever own.

We considered the D40 and D60 but felt that for a little more money the D5000 offered a much better value.  It will allow you to take beautiful still images but also adds the ability to take HD videos or create a time-lapse project.  To that extent it's a much more powerful, versatile imaging device. It also provides the ability to take great shots right off the bat with a lot of advanced featues so there is room to grow with the D5000. We considered the Canon XSi and T1i, but preferred the way the Nikon felt in our hands and their arrangement of buttons and dials worked better for us.  In the end we would say go with what fits best in your budget and what feels best in your hand.  Your creativity is really the most important tool.The build quality of the D5000 is very good.  We like the articulating screen.  The camera is very fast and takes beautiful pictures at just the automatic settings.  With all the flexibility that a DSLR offers you have a lot of room to explore different shutter speeds, aperture settings, etc.  The menu system is surprisingly easy to navigate, allowing you to change a setting, test with a shot or two and then quickly return to that setting  without having to drill down through the menus again.  The built in Help system is very useful for less experienced photographers.The only negatives we would say are that the camera is slightly larger and heavier than the D60 (might not be a problem if you have larger hands) and that it's a little on the expensive side.  Also, it has so many features that it can be a little intimidating (but that's kind of the fun of it too).  Some owners have reported a glitch with the power system but luckily we haven't experienced that and it seems Nikon is taking quick action to fix the problem.The D40/D60 or the Canons all seem like great cameras.

We purchased this camera in preparation for a recent overseas trip. We purchased it several months in advance in order to \"learn\" the camera. A week before our two week overseas trip, the camera shorted out, there was a complete \"power fail\" as I learned.  We thought we had purchased a dud, returned it. The retail store said their procedure is to send it back to the manufacture to be repaired and it would take 4 weeks. Mentioned no \"service advisory\" but were very sympathetic.  Because of our schedule they kindly gave us a brand new camera and went on our 2 week overseas vacation.  Mid vacation the same thing happened. You could imagine my anger and frustration over the situation.Upon my return rather then going back to the retail store, I first called Nikon.  The told me there was a \"Service Advisory\" on the product because it was prone to a \"power fail\" and we could just send it in to be repaired, no big deal.... Huh?  Kinda big deal. As it turns out they've known about the issue for quite some time but have done nothing to address it. I was informed that dealers and retailers know of this \"advisory\" and someone should have told us, but in my weeks of research and asking around prior to purchasing the camera I never came across such an \"advisory\". Despite much pushing and prying with the service department over the phone(not yelling, I'm not that kinda person), I could get no real responses. Here is a summary:I asked, what guarantee can you give me that after you repair the camera this won't happen again? The response was \"well, they've had repairs done and cameras sent back and for over 6 months or more, they haven't had any returned a second time.\"  I asked, so you've known about this for well over six months, why didn't you simply recall the product like most manufactures do? \"We didn't want to inconvenience the customer.\" I said, isn't it more inconvenient to unsuspectingly purchase a product that will break in the middle of my vacation, only so I can send it in, be without it for a month and then constantly worry that the same thing is going to happen again for the rest of the time I own the product? They say, \"well, it won't break again\". My response, well I'm not sure I want to risk that. I'm not sure I even want this camera anymore. I don't think I'm interested in purchasing a Nikon product ever again. I would rather have a different brand if only for peace of mind. Is there anything you can do about that? Even a different, more reliable model?\" \"No, maybe your retailer would let you have a different model or brand since you bought their service plan.\" I reply, \"really so they should be responsible for taking care of your inferior product? What incentive can you give me to stay with this camera?\" And they say, \"Currently we offer no incentives. All we can do is have you send in your camera to be repaired and send it back to you.\"The conversation continues on and on about like this. So my advice? Don't buy this camera unless you are interested in purchasing it, using it for a few weeks until it unexpectedly breaks mid-event and then you'll need to ship it in to be without your camera again for a few weeks, only to get it back with no \"real\" guarantee that it will never break again.

Actually trying to pass the happiness I am having for getting such and amazing product in hands, after so many good options I looked over!!Got it with 18-55mm lenses, a small tripod and a 16GB class 4 SDHC card. Was in doubt between nikon's D5000, D90 or D60, Canon's EOS Xsi and T1i, Sony's A200 or A350 and Olympus E520 or E620.First, I have had some diferent digital cameras (and also a couple analogic before that), the better ones being sony's DSC W7, H9 and  H50 (not mine, but I used for some days), so I don't know how the D5000 compares to other DSLR, but I can feel the great lap between this amazing camera and those other simpler ones I am used to...My first impression was that it really can take good color, bright and lively pictures from the box, on auto mode... maybe the one I am least using by now, but good to know it will work when you can't or don't want to set anything before the shot. So the camera goes great on full AUTO. Same for video, easy to focus with the kit lenses and pretty professional looking movie results.My dad was with the camera for 2 weeks before I put my hands on it, and he shot amazing pics from simple places and situations, even at night... and he was on AUTO all time, so this nikon can be used as a point-and-shoot, actually the best I've ever seen... it is funny to see that any picture taken with it looks like it would be very hard or impossible to be taken with the cameras we used before.I havent posted any video so far, but I had put some pics here [...]I've done a lot of research on the DSLR world and the most useful site was [...] where I found the info that made me decide between the Canon EOS 500 (or T1i) and this Nikon D5000 that I got here on amazon.com .So, knowing some previous things about aperture, shutter speed, focus, depth of field an ISO from the previous cameras and some books I've read in the past fell weeks I tried the Nikon on the other modes, A,M,S and P...Ok, P is also as good as the AUTO, but it is almost just AUTO, I found it hard to change to the type of exposure I wanted while rolling the control. So between this and AUTO I stay with AUTO.\"A\" mode (aperture prior)works great for me... the control with the DOF is good and the kit lenses on auto focus are great.The \"S\" mode is normal, but I have not used it too much, havent had action scenes so far.The \"M\" mode is easy to use as all controls are at reach, the only change I did was to make the Fn button control the ISO, so I have the shutter on the main wheel with my right thumb, click with a finger on the button behind the shutter and have the wheel to control aperture, with my left thumb I make it control the ISO or flash (2 buttons well placed close to the lenses) and if I use manual focus the left hand is already in place and stays there, zooming and focusing.About the kit lenses (18-55mm nikkor lenses), the focus has a really short turn (about 30 degrees, but fells like 5) from 28cm to infinity, it is handleable on manual focus but a bit too sensitive... the zooming is perfect though.I already bought a used nikkor 28mm 2.8 AF-D lenses, that goes well with the D5000 (with manual focus only, cause it is not DX) and have a much better focus ring, with about 160 degree turn from 25mm to infinity that fells like 360... this made me fell good for not buying an olympus because the nikon DX format has a 1.5 relation for lenses and the four third had a 2.0 relation, at this point  I realise that finding good old used lenses that can work well on the D5000 is easy, and this 28mm lense made me remember using my father's yashica 45mm focus when I was 6... very good felling.For the manual focus the camera helps with the green light that goes on when on focus, and changing the menu to show distance info on the viewfinder I got it to show arrows that indicate to witch side to change the focus.Live view... I did not mention, but my father took all his picures on this mode and liked it, so again can be used as p-a-s, but I have not used it too much, just loved the viewfinder and the 11point AF.The picture reviewing is also nice on the LCD panel and it being articulated is good for awkward shots, but even greater to protect it and to maintain the screen off when using the viewfinder (when I don't want more info than that on the small window).I did record some movies and they all look great, only did on 720p and no complains, all them look better than any other camera I used, only inconvenience is the focus but it is easy to learn... and zooming during video looks nicer than on video cameras that have digital controls for zooming.Battery lasts long, about 6 days traveling on my father's hands and 1 or 2 full shooting days on my hands... you notice that the camera is all the time saving power and even turning the LCD off when you are looking is not annoying because it comes back nicely.Flash is powerful and have a good range, also very tunable for adding light to a scene or to freezing someone or something on a shot... helped with some exposures...The retouching options are fast, easy to understand and vastly usable, I did some shots on a cloudy day and with some NEF processing on camera and one or two other adjustments (also in the camera) I got images that seemed taken at noon!!In conclusion on this messy review, the D5000 is a great camera and I would recommend to anybody who wants good pictures and movies... take that from a DSLR newbie and a nature, travel, sports and technology lover.And also, on my personal experience, it fells amazing to handle this camera, hear it shooting, bursting at 4fps (the sound is lovely), doing everything well and much more than I would expect.

I have had no problem learning the camera- manual is well written for us simple folk and there is video tuturing available from Nikon which I have yet to take advantage of.  I also purchased the 55-300 AF-S VR lens as I needed the zoom to get shots of my son on the field from up in the stands.  MAKE sure you get the AF-S VR if you want it compatible with the autofocus- VR is vibration reduction which is a must for handheld photos! Getting great shots of the musical without the flash in the theater was a bit more tricky and took some practice during the rehearsal nights- tips from a friends sister ( who is a pro. photographer)on what ISO setting to use was all I needed and now have great pictures that I shared with the parents of the leading cast members as well as the director.

We owned a Nikon D40 for some time and absolutely loved it.  6 megapixels is more than enough and it took some outstanding photos.  Now, as guy who feels the need to have the latest tech and get the best deals, I found a Canon Xsi for an outstanding price and jumped in headfirst.  I quickly sold the D40 and we went through a few months of pain with the Canon.  Photos were blurry, the color was off, and even after warranty service, it still had its issues.  So when the Nikon D5000 came out, I upgraded again...and couldn't be happier!The D5000 is a natural upgrade for the D40/D60 as it offers more power, more megapixels (not important), video recording, and best of all, excellent low-light shots.  You'll still need to buy those AF-S lenses as this camera doesn't have autofocus built in, but there are so many of those available at this point, it's not a big deal.The vari-angle lcd screen in the back is also very useful for taking awkward shots...trust me, you'll use it.  It also gives the added bonus of protecting the screen as you can flip it around when the camera is not be used.The menus also received a big update in this generation and are much user-friendly imho.  Less confusion=better!The only con with this camera, is the same con that all dslrs have; it's big.  A little bit larger than the D40, but smaller than the D90.

IMHO this camera is a good value, the image quality is was it should be given the cost, the manufacturing is up to par and the overall performance is possibly more than an amateur photographer needs. It will likely take me months to really appreciate all this camera can do while still taking great pictures using the predefined (auto, portrait, sport etc.) settings. I am using a high speed (6x) Lexmark memory card and the fast shooting capability are pretty good, the only thing slowing you down is the AF. Turn that off and go wild (if you know what you are doing). I definitely think the next buy is going to be filters, the 55mm \"beginner\" lens that come with it can benefit from them when shooting outdoors. After that, a more powerful (and expensive) tele. Overall, I am pretty happy with the purchase but I cannot give it a 5 star yet only because I am not convinced 100% that it is worth  the price tag. A little less ($100 less?) may have been a more fair price but again I have not discovered all that it can do so maybe I am just being too harsh. If you always wanted a dSLR and have been sitting on the fence waiting, I recommend you stop waiting and you get the D5000 with the lens kit. BTW I considered saving $200 and go for the D3000 but I am happy I did not, I would probably be disappointed by the D3000. Go for the D5000 so that you have a true entry level SLR.NOTE: I had the same problem someone else reported with some speckle of dust showing up on the view finder. Obviously Nikon should do a better job during assembly. With that said, this is easily resolved by removing the lens (do that in a clean indoor room!) and gently blowing some clear air (low pressure) inside the camera. This will simply blow off whatever manufacturing material may be left and the view finder is clear again.

It does have a few flaws, however I think given the overall value of the camera, it has been great to use.This is my first DSLR, however my third SLR.  I have previously owned two Minolta film SLRs which were both great, but it became a hassle to develop photos for me.  I found that after I bought my digital point and shoot, the convenience of digital overcame the need to swap out lenses on a film camera.  Until now when I jumped to my new DSLR...Therefore, this is an excellent camera for someone with experience with SLRs.  It works for a beginner, however I think newer models like the D3000 would be more suitable if you are just starting off since that camera is more geared towards holding your hand while shooting.  This camera has the user friendliness, but also has quite a few advanced features for those in the know or willing to learn.The articulating screen is kind of a double-edged sword.  The fact that it swings down is nice as I've used it quite a few times to get some unique angles with the camera and when closed it protects the LCD from scratches.  But auto-focus in live view is very slow.  I recommend that you use LV only when framing a shot.  Once you have the shot set, turn off live view and then take the shot (best on a tripod).  The main negative to the swing down screen is that some tripods prevent rotating of the screen once the camera is mounted.  Fortunately my tripod's quick-release is shaped in a way that I can mount the camera and articulate the screen without hitting the tripod.  The other negative to the articulating screen is that its much smaller than the screen on the D90 and has a lower resolution.  It also is almost worthless to view pics if you are shooting outdoors.  There is quite a bit of glare in bright light as well as its hard to tell if the shot was what you wanted or not.  To me this is the single biggest complaint of the camera--good thing the screen doesn't affect the photo quality.I've only shot one video with the camera.  I didn't buy a DSLR to shoot video, so this feature really does nothing for me.  And I'm guessing that more people are probably in the same boat as I am.Pros:-Excellent image quality-Camera size is great for its portability-Intuitive controls; easy to use for photographers with a good understanding of photography-Great value-Articulating screen and live view are great when used properly-Will shoot video if you need it--its a nice feature but it isnt going to replace a dedicated video recorder.Cons:-Articulating screen can be annoying if you don't have the right tripod.-Live view is worthless unless using it to frame up a shot.  Takes about 6-8 seconds to autofocus in LV mode-LCD is not very good to view in bright light.-The view finder is a bit dim--esp compared to the D90.To sum things up, this camera is great for an 'advanced enthusiast' looking for a great value.  If you are a photographer who new, get a D3000.  If things like in body focusing motors and larger viewfinder are important to you, then I'd say its worth paying a few extra hundred on the D90.  But if you don't have an extensive Nikon non-AF lens collection, then I really don't see much reason to pay extra money for the D90 since the internals are all pretty much the same.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "excellent entry-level DSLR", "Author": "Daneasa Andrei", "ReviewID": "R281UB5UKW641I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exactly what I expected.

The option to hide the LCD is nice especially when your a person that will just \"toss\" a camera into a car...or have a 2 year old that wants to touch everything you are touching.OPTIONS! its nice having an entire world open up when you step from point and shoots to the DSLR. Every time I try to understand something about the camera, another type of \"photography\" pops up.  I wanted to take faster shutter speed pics then I found out about HDR pics which the D5000 can help you do...while learning about that, I found out about Time Lapse videos which...once again, the D5000 can help you do  with its built in intervalometer (automatically takes pics at certain times for you)..while learning that I found out how to take better portraits...its got a variety of ability's that are just too cool.Battery: compared to the old samsung I have... its AWESOME! I was getting 200 pics on a charge with the samsung, with the NIKON D5000 I can get ~800 pics continuous.Ease of operation...

On the plus side for me, I can tweak all sorts of things and have fun all day playing with the camera.

Fulbright", "ReviewID": "R2V4Q7JIKDU0P9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off we'll tackle the LiveView arguments. The complaint is that the LiveView feature focus is either SO incredibly slow or it just fails to focus at all.I was really worried about this going in because the whole reason for this over a D90 in my case was that the stupid angles I tend to like taking pictures from REALLY make an articulating LCD a godsend.Well, my first picture with the 5k was in a room with no lighting other than a natural light source in the form of a sliding glass door (venetian blinds half open) in the OTHER room (though the door was in front of me and I WAS shooting in it's direction, but still the light level was LOW). The AF on LV took approx 2sec. to lock focus perfectly (I tried manually adjusting for better but could not). Tried this again with an artificial (CCFL, warm, not cool, spiral type) light source BEHIND me, approx. 6ft from the subject. The time to focus was about 1.3 seconds (iPhone used for stopwatch, so add in my reaction time if you want, personally at 1.3sec I don't care).The bottom line here is AF in LiveView is something NO DSLR does truly WELL right now, but as far as what's out there goes, this performs admirably. And my fears have ALL vanished.Next up, the recall.Ooooh, scary, right? Not so much, first of all the complaints voiced here are that Nikon is somehow being shady by not giving an open list of which serial numbers are impacted. Look the simple truth of the matter is you either have this problem, and it's pretty much dead from the factory, or you don't. There was a pretty insanely wild guesstimation by one of the 1-star reviewers here on amazon who, one breath after saying there was no information available on affected units, then proceeded to toss out potential numbers for affected units.Yes, there is a recall, but the plain truth is, you get your camera, you turn it on, odds are GOOD it will power on just like mine did, fresh and happy and ready to go. If you are still worried you go to their site, plug in the serial number, and get your mind put at ease. This is NOT that big a deal and I personally think it's good of Nikon to voluntarily offer a recall without having to be brow beaten into it, especially on one of their more buzzworthy cameras, normally (ahem, apple) you'd have to bury a company in a pile of their defective products up to their ears to get them to replace one of their \"most talked about\" new products.Cut then some slack. And rest fairly comfortably in the knowledge that, odds are more than just good you wont get a defective unit.As for the rest of the camera, I LOVE the auto-rotating menu for the LCD, just, awesome, the articulating LCD is great and I for one am VERY happy it's not side-hinged, if you have problems with this hitting your tripod, you take shots from WAY more crazier angles than me lol, and that's saying something. :)Image quality, top notch.Menu systems. I will go on record as saying that nikon has THE best menu system on a DSLR, PERIOD. ABSOLUTELY in love with it.Love the optional viewfinder gridlines ala the D90, the 11-area-AF is superb and fast in non-LV mode. LV is as good as ALMOST any other example out there right now (and if you exclude cameras if LV-focus specific lenses it's an even closer race).A note, you WILL need to upgrade CameraRaw to 5.4 if you use Photoshop (CS4 here) or the NEF files wont be understood, rest easy though as it's a free upgrade.[...]What else. The weight is nice, still lighter than a D90 but not as feather light as a D40, continues the common-model battery from most other Nikon's which is great, means if you go from one Nikon to another you gain yourself an extra battery and charger out of the deal (handy!).Overall this is a GREAT camera for the price. If an articulating LCD is important to you, then this is the camera for you, if it doesn't matter, consider the D90, it's pentaprism IS a step up but the differences are NOT great.HIGHLY recommend this camera.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent entry level dSLR camera", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R3IYCYH787LZOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My D5000 was delivered yesterday evening while I was at work. The lovely wife opened the box enough to pull the battery out and charge it for me. After a grueling 12 hour shift at work I had forgotten about my new toy.I had purchased the D5000 w/ 18/55 kit lens then separately purchased a 55/200 VR kit lens. It was cheaper that way. Go figure.After many doggie slobbers when I arrived home I noticed the D5000 box on the kitchen table. My heart started palpating. I tried to control my self to no avail. My new toy was here! I carefully unpacked everything. I actually followed the quick start guide and was ready in no time.I'm a big guy with the requisite big hands. The D5000 felt good in my hands. Not too heavy, not too light. The black body was finished with a slightly rough tactile coating. Very nice. My right thumb fit nicely in the thumb spot while my right index finger felt at home on the shutter. With a firm grip on the D5000 I was able to fully articulate my wrist and point the camera in a variety of positions. The camera felt good in my hand. I could tell that I could lug this beauty around for a full day and not get the dreaded \"photog's wrist syndrome.\"I attached the 18/55 kit lens. The lens seemed to provide a better balance when attached to the body. The VR switch, on the lens, was factory set to OFF. My first few images didn't utilize the VR. I was so excited and getting more excited by the minute that I forgot the properly look at the lens. I could notice the difference between the VR switching. This 18/55 kit lens is quite amazing. Sure it's made out of plastic, but it does a great job. If you don't already have Nikon lenses then the 18/55 kit lens is a no brainer. Well worth it.As the quick guide said...Frame your first subject...then BAM!I was looking for subjects to shoot. Since I work nights everyone, except the dog, was asleep. So I can't run around flipping light switches, move knick-knacks, or anything that could involve waking the baby. God forbid I wake the baby. My wife would have my testicles drawn and quartered within 7.9 seconds. Of course it's been raining for 2 days straight. So I'm stuck in the house...with a new camera. No worries!I really like the D5000. Coming from the \"superzoom point & shoot world\" this is a welcome, although a little scary, change. I used film SLR cameras up until the late 90's so I have some experience with SLR photography. But the digital advances sure make everything so much easier. I'm not a \"all manual all the time\" kind of guy. Like most of us, I want the added feature of full-manual to play with, but like having an excellent and fast AUTO feature. I like to spend time with my family when we're all out and about and don't like to fiddle with any settings.

I actually have been a life long customers. I have had two other Nikons and was very happy with then. I actualy upgraded my last 35 mm Nikon with this digital version (D5000). I got the camera and everything worked great but one day I it put it down a month and a half later and the camera would not turn on. I checked the internet and found a bunch of listings for recalls. I looked at my camera and my number was not affected. Luckily it was still under warranty so I returned it to the store and received another brand new camera (this was a big mistake should have gotten a canon instead of accepting a new one). I used the new camera for about 8 months and again one day I put it down picked it up the next day and it would not turn on. I purchased the set that came with two lenses for about 1300 dollars. That was the worse waste of money I have ever experienced. I am sorry to say that I will never buy a Nikon again. I think their 35mm cameras are great. The last one I had for about 10 years with not a problem either lenses or body for both of my previous cameras. Nikon digital versions however don't hsave the same quality. This one is my greatest diaspointment but don't take my word for it. Google \"Defective Nikon D5000\" and you will find scores of complaints.

He's quick, so the shutter speed was important and it performed flawlessly in all light levels.  I don't know who complained about the video function, but I thought it was exceptional for playing on my computer or uploading to YouTube or Facebook.  It didn't look too bad on my 46\" flatscreen either.  The coloring of my puppy tends to pixilate most digital cameras but this didn't happen with the D5000, his ticking came out crisp and clear in either still or video mode. I just returned from a cruise to the Bahamas and took some incredible sunsets and beach shots with the aid of a polarizing filter. The VBR was invaluable for steading the shots especialy when taking photos of the evening stars, and you would never know they were taken from a ship during twilight.I have small hands and the weight and grip of the D5000 was perfect. The only downside was I bought the kit with two lenses and a Nikon bag, unfortunately the bag was too small for both lenses to fit comfortably along with the filters and books. I ended up purchasing a Lowepro backback from Amazon which was very secure as it opened on the inside. Battery life was also amazing shooting over 1200 frames (including some with flash), but I didn't use the live view feature except for the video.  I found the viewfinder to be large enough that I didn't need the live view for stills.Overall I adore this camera.

Fortunately, because I had purchased under Amazon and American Express, I was protected.  I am not an expert photographer, but I wanted my first really good camera.  In all fairness, when sold as a workable product, it seems like a great camera.  I really liked the feel and look of this one, and the closable viewer was a plus.  The picture quality was nice, but a little disappointing (however, I'm not a great photographer, so I can't say that was the camera).  I read that the battery life was good, but it seemed to run out pretty easily.  Here was the problem.  The camera just started turning off on me.  Then it wouldn't turn on.  At first, I thought it was the battery (which obviously did have issues, too) but recharging didn't stop the problem.  So I contacted Nikon and they told me it was flawed.  Apparently, there was a recall, and for this same problem, but the one I had was not in the numbers they were listing.  So instead of telling me, hey, send it back and we'll send you a good one -- they told me -- and mind you, I had just purchased this camera for over 700.00 dollars -- to bring it into a repair shop and pay to get it fixed.  (?!?!)  I didn't even stop to debate this with them -- I just *thanked my lucky stars* that I had bought with Amazon and American Express.  The rest is history.  I felt badly, too, because I had hoped that I had launched a relationship with a very good company.  Maybe they usually are on top of things, but I wasn't going to hang around and find out, after spending so much money on a camera, and when I only had so much time to return it.  I had also put a lot of preparation and research into finding the D5000.  Because these cameras are a long term investment where you keep acquiring additional add-ons.

Or a tripod shot where pushing the release with your finger risks a less-detailed shot.  Right?  Except that the remote shutter release for the D5000 only triggers FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAMERA!

I'm curious to know if anyone else finds this frustrating and if anyone else has rigged some kind of work-around with a dental mirror or...?  I own the camera now, so I'd really like to be able to trigger the shutter from where most photographers position themselves, i.e. BEHIND THE CAMERA!Thank you.PS -- are there cameras where the focus ring on the tele-zoom is out toward the front of the lens?  When manually focusing with the fingers right up next to the body and all that lens hanging out in space, it's pretty hard to hand-hold a shot.  Much less likely that I'm going to need access to the zoom ring as I'm shooting, compared to the focus ring.  Oh, well...can't have everything. Give me a remote shutter release that works from the right position and I'm a happy camper.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!

First foray into DSLR photography and I can say this is a big leap from point-and-shoot.

Right out of the box, though, the pictures are amazing!  18-35mm lens does the job well for all-around shooting.  Purchased the 55-200mm lens with this camera and it also does as advertised.  Looking forward to see how the speed on the zoom lens works out shooting some Friday Night football and also shooting some wildlife photos, which I've not gotten to do either of yet . . . but I will be doing both.  Will check back in later after I've had chance to explore the almost unlimited custom settings on this camera.  Job well done, Nikon.

The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that at times its almost TOO complicated...whereas I kind of wish they could have taken some more aspect of the D60 in terms of simplicity (i.e. accidently got into video mode and for the life of me, couldn't figure out how to get out of that mode!!).  Other than that, stunning pictures and the screen (360 movable) is the best feature.  Oh, plus you can record video.

However, in auto mode I did take the camera out for a night and was disappointed that in low light the camera performed worse than my compact point-and-shoot. I mean, with the old Canon Ixus I could take a shot in the dark.

When I was starting out, I considered the picture quality great, thought the HDVid thing was awesome...and it came with a lens, too!!! I wanted to move up from a handheld digital camera to the big SLRs!Now that I take photographs as a hobby, go to many sporting events, and sometimes work as a photographer at weddings, I have outgrown this camera and no longer use it as my primary. I use this camera as a backup now, just in case my D3 or D300 break down or somehow run out of juice.This camera is great for biginning photographers, but lacks the \"Umph\" that the higher lever SLRs bring. It uses a single SDHC instead of CF cards, you cant put a NIKON brand battery pack/grip on it (limited batery time, cannot adjust for faster shutter speed), its rather small compared to other SLRs and lighter, too.Some great features? The swivel screen protects it from scratches and it comes with a starter lens. Its smaller, so if portability is your thing, more power to you.I prefer my bulkier and heavier cameras. You are more careful and can get a better grip with them. If I could go back in time and purchase another camera?

To see the LCD viewfinder while shooting yourself you can't swivel the LCD up or to the side.  You can only swivel it down, which makes it blocked by the tripod.  And there doesn't seem to be an accessory that allows you to mount the tripod off to the side.2-There's no inexpensive AC adaptor.  You have to buy a dummy battery for $30 and then you have to buy a $70 AC adaptor which connects the dummy battery to the wall outlet.  It's cheaper just to buy 2 more batteries.  But for time lapse photography you probably need the AC adaptor.3-No automatic lens cleaner.  I was somehow lead to believe that Nikon invented an automatic lens cleaner.  But their auto cleaner just cleans the image sensor.  But when does that ever get dirty?  It's the outer lens that needs the automatic cleaning.4-Poor manual focus.  The focusing ring on the lens only allows course focus (1/8 turn from min to max focus).  And the viewfinder doesn't have split spot focus.  So you have to magnify the LCD to the area that needs focus and then turn the focus ring very gingerly until it looks sharpest.  The course focusing ring makes the slightest twist an over correction.5-Cheap lens cap.  The lens cap is not automatic (like in compact cameras) and you have to put it somewhere when you remove it.  It doesn't hang down on a string or open up while remaining on the lens front.  Having to deal with the lens cap takes away from the awesomeness of the rest of the camera.6-Did not come with a memory card.  I wanted to play with the camera right when I received it.  But I had to order a memory card and wait two days for it to arrive.  There is no internal memory to do temporary storage.  If you don't have a memory card you can't take pictures.Making Videos:It does not have 1080 resolution.At it's highest resolution (1280x720) you can only record up to 5 min.The 2nd higest res gives you 20min, but it's a weird resolution (640x424).The optional remote control does not work for movies.No follow focus.  And manual focus is very course.I was hoping to be able to use this as both my still camera and my video camera.
