Mccarthy \"The Fe Duke\"", "ReviewID": "RY590394Z9WII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Digital cameras come with increasing built in computation power but Sony has really jumped in front with the Nex5.  This is the smartest camera you ever haven't used.  The stock 18-55 lens that comes with the camera doesn't really give you \"18mm\" wide angle.  The real 35mm equivalent is 27-83mm.  BUT, the camera comes with an incredible virtually real-time \"sweep panorama\" feature that is simply awesome.  The camera takes about 20 pictures while you sweep across the scene, and then stitches the resulting pictures together in a breath taking panorama.  It even works just inside a room.  The processor in the camera does a better job stitching than Photoshop on its best day.  The only thing is you really can't have is moving subject matter in your scene, or the moving subject will end up in several positions in the panorama.  The pictures taken normally are simply excellent.  BUT, in low light non-flash conditions (such as a room or scene where your puny on-camera flash would be ridiculous)(sorry no flash shoe, so thats all you get) ) the camera has a multi-shot low light mode, which it then uses to reconstitute the exposure of the picture, that is also simply awesome.  I found the controls combined with the 3inch backplane screen (which is moveable) very intuitive.  You do have to take care with the auto focusing in low light conditions, as it sometimes has trouble.  But with patience it will get it right.  Battery life is EXCELLENT (all day at the Expo in Shanghai, MULTIPLE panoramas, etc., only used 37% of the battery).  The strap attachment positions are mid back, so the camera is always pointing DOWN, (which it is always going to do anyway with a heavy lens) is inspired.  Finally, this camera is really light.  At the EXPO I saw endless camera users by noon doing the \"one arm camera cradle\" to take the weight off their neck and neck strap.  Never even felt this camera on my neck all day.  The 1080p video is the better than with Sony's 1080p video cameras!", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony NEX 5", "Author": "Jorge Corredor Zaccour", "ReviewID": "R2I3EX2O32COTN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Sony NEX 5 as an upgrade for a Sony Cybershot H50. Besides being an incredibly fun DSLR camera, it's a piece of technology. At the moment, it's the smallest and lightest DSLR, achieving this by removing some features not so relevant anymore, no viewfinder, image stabilization is built in the lenses not the camera, and the flash is external. With the 18-55 lens, it looks pretty big and professional, although when you switch to the 16 lens the size is equivalent to a point and shoot, small enough to fit in your pocket. The user interface is really nice and friendly, an entire tutorial of the camera and features is built into the UI for beginners. The built quality of the camera and lenses is outstanding, plus the true black display is beautiful. Oh, and it records movies in full HD. I'm not a professional photographer and far from it, but this camera is really fun, get it if you can.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "Prehistoric Praetor", "ReviewID": "RPS2EMAXABNLP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a fan of digital photography, i have owned and operated primarily on the Nikon bandwagon, starting off with a Nikon D70 until i finally settled on the D300. So far , i am not yet compelled to purchase an upgrade for my DSLR however, i wanted to complement my setup by adding a camera with HD video capture capabilities that is more portable and consumer looking (yeah, some places that I visit is just anti-DSLR) camera. After looking at several mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras from Olympus, Panasonic I was drawn to the Sony NEX-5 and the kit on this page. So far I am not disappointed and have been pleasantly surprised with some of the features that I now use often like panoramic swipes and 3D capture (this is hit and miss but nice to have). The first week of testing was mostly video, with my wife giving birth, i wanted to capture key moments of the delivery. All the videos were perfect at 1080i at 29min maximum per footage, except one footage where the video looks like it was stuttering. The camera was mounted on a tripod and has a class 10 SDHC. Havent been able to replicate the issue (might be a card issue i suspect). Battery life could be better. Manual mode is a bit of a chore but with a firmware update at least some of the keys are now programmable. Still pictures look okay in bright light and there seems to be a bit of color over saturation in indoor shots using imode. RIght now I primarily shoot in RAW on my DSLR and I do the same on the NEX-5.In summary, i like the feel and look of the NEX-5, the flexibility of using Manual and intelligent automatic modes, the capability to shoot RAW, support for eye-fi (which i adore). Wish i could give it a five but sometimes I find myself questioning some interface design decisions.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Idiot proof pictures", "Author": "Chef D", "ReviewID": "RPBCDH5JT165F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am horrible with technology for the most part and even worst at photography.  However, this camera takes excellent shots even for me.  It is nice and compact (not bulky like Nikon or Cannon) with very few buttons.  It is easy to shoot with straight out the box...I can't say enough about it.  Only negative is the price but for any camera in this class you will pay a pretty penny anyway.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "great for travel!", "Author": "summerc", "ReviewID": "R14A9FR80DBBIM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "easy to use, perfect size, great price point! really happy we bought this camera before our vacation. also enjoying using it for our business. highly recommend!", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Highest praise for this camera -as good as the \"big boys\"", "Author": "randy c", "ReviewID": "R2PNEWV70DNRYI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could not believe how good this camera is.  I have been a photographer for years and I believe this is one camera is as good as a Nikon and a lot of fun to boot.  My wife can use it as a point in shoot and I can use it's extended features/  I highly recommend it.  The video was very good and the low light photos were hard to believe.  Get the one with both lenses because the wide angle lens is good for movies but not so good for close up work so the medium telephoto works best here.  A word of caution, this camera is hard to find in stock even on the internet.

I know the basics, not much more than that, but I Love taking pictures.  This camera's Intelligent Auto setting is great for 90% of the time.  It takes great clear pictures in any setting.  The flash is super easy to put onto the camera, and small enough that I just leave it on all the time and flip it up when necessary.There are many settings if you're advanced enough that you want to be able to adjust shutter speed, aperture, or anything else really.The camera is a godsend and I would recommend it to anyone.I actually bought it for my mom for her birthday after I got it because it is so awesome.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy Wow what a picture", "Author": "james", "ReviewID": "RD8CSG25LVBI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Love this camera it is small compact and light.
