{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great kit to start your DSLR camera adventure", "Author": "Douglas W. Decampos", "ReviewID": "R2U395JAU3QJUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is my first DSLR camera and you cannot buy the body only, you must have a couple of devices. Everything included is awesome products EXCEPT the screen protector which was lost in the first day besides the work and bubbles when I was placing it.The bag is excellent and fits everything which comes with the kit plus another lense. Also the bag is original from Nikon.The battery extra is very handling and I liked the extra charger which has support to international outlets and has car adapter. The memory card is a great one to store your memories and with reasonable storage space and writing speed. The cleaning kit is awesome and has everything you need to mantain your lenses and camera, the remote control is another important device to take picture of yourself and those pictures from the tripod without shaking, you will use it a lot!  The tripod is perfect size for travel and comes with a bag to carry it. The hdmi cable is another required to show it on tv and you really need since the display is small to give you all picture details. The flash is very basic, I have been happy with the built-in but you will need it to cover wedding and other events. Finally the lense is original from Nikon and the right size to carry it on your adventures, the 300mm is too big, 18-200mm you cover 90% of your needs. I recomend you just add a fish eye lense and a 35mm or 50mm to make your camera lighter. The filter is very important in order to protect your lenses against accident and also it is easier to clean a filter than a camera. Finally the wallet to store memory cards it is handy even though I am not using it since the camera comes with 2 slots which for me it is more than enough storage.About the camera, I am very pleased with the photos quality and features. You must read a book to understand about the aperture, iso and shuttle to take full advantage. The automatic modes will not do all the work. I have been using it for 2months so far and it is amazing. I recommend to buy a silicone cover to protect the body.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great photographer's package!", "Author": "Elaine Lewis", "ReviewID": "RJRKY2NYIZRSB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This high quality Nikon camera body with the lens, filter, SD card, flash, and much much more makes it easy to have what you need altogether, and makes it possible to start taking pictures wherever and whenever you need right away!

I was skeptical first since I never owned DSLR camera before but I am very happy with my purchase. I still haven't used the extra stuff that came in the package but plan to use it soon. The lens 18-200 mm can be used from taking protrait, macro, landscape to sports and many more situations, I like it because you dont have to keep on changing the lenses. The pictures are sharp and very nice. I hardly use any photoshop. I LOVE THIS CAMERA.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "My husband loves it. Need go through instruction to master Camera.
