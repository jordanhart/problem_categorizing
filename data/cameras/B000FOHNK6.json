Unfortunately, the camera did not come as advertised.  The camera was falsely advertised as having a 14-45mm lense.  What you really get is a 17.5-45mm made in China cheap throw-away lense!  This is not your typical Japan made high quality lense that is available in a new kit.Because the cheap lense is included, this isn't such a good deal.", "Date": "July 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Wrong Lens in the Box!!!
