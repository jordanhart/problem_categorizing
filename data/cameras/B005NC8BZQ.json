{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Coolpix AW100 - Worth the cost", "Author": "MamaBibs", "ReviewID": "RL4M2MNNSI06O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera for my mother-in-law for her birthday.  She is very hard on cameras and they typically only last her 6 months to a year.  She had been using a camera that was dinged, dented and not zooming anymore.  Nothing could hold up to her level of abuse.  So, when we saw this camera we knew we would buy this for her.  She has had and used this camera for 4 months now.  She loves it!  It has endured being dropped.  It has spent the night outside in both the rain and dew.  And it is no worse for the wear!  Recently my husband and I borrowed her camera for a trip to Sea World.  I was so happy that we did.  It was fantastic not needing to worry about our camera when Shamu soaked us to the bone.  It also took fantastic action pictures.  We have some incredible shots of whales and dolphins mid-air with water droplets falling off of them. We were so pleased that I am going to purchase our own Coolpix AW100 before we go to Disney World this summer.I was also very pleased with all the accessories that came with our camera.  We have used about half of the items regularly.  The rest are nice to have for special circumstances but haven't been useful to us yet.  When we go to Schlitterbahn (a water park) I may finally have use for the floating camera strap.We have been very pleased with this purchase for my mother-in-law and will probably be making a similar purchase for ourselves very soon.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "MASH", "ReviewID": "R2FXCBSC6F5WV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have bought two of these for gifts.  One a wedding gift that was their favorite for the honeymoon and the other for our son.  He has shared so many great memories with his photo taken.  It is a great way to preserve memories.  All the extas are wonderful and comes in so handy.  I would buy it again in a heart beat.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good to Have", "Author": "Gbratsblondie", "ReviewID": "R30M5DH8KCZ56H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually shoot with a Nikon D300S. But when I went on vacation, I didn't want to bring that along. The last time I did it broke. So I decided since we were going to be doing underwater activities I would give this a go. It takes spectacular underwater pictures. I was really happy.  Maybe it isn't like having a whole underwater pro set up but for the price you can't beat it.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good opcion", "Author": "david philipp", "ReviewID": "R3KN6IKWRJNQIW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camara is perfect for me because i need to work outside and some times the fall frommyhands or bag and simetimes is raining", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix", "Author": "Skydiver \"skydiver\"", "ReviewID": "R22Y6TX7W9LOUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little camera with all the big camera features.Have been using it down here in Florida taking pics of the wild life both in the rivers  and the gulf.Have some awesome shots of Manatees.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal!", "Author": "From BRAZIL", "ReviewID": "R1B8AN4HQOBNJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera and tons of extras, haven't tried it in the water yet but ....... so far so good, couldn't be happier!", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect Present", "Author": "Perfect Present", "ReviewID": "R371X6KU3OLL4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I appreciate and look for honest reviews but usually do not write my own.

More than a bargain as usual from Camanetti camera. They have the best packages. I have purchased from them ever sense I got into the camera products from Canon. If I can find them offering a package with the item I want, I will usually buy it. The AW100 does more than I expected. The digital manual is larger than my Canon XS or T3. I also purchased a Hoya cir-pl filter. Works more than great. Very happy as usual!", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005NC8BZQ"}}
