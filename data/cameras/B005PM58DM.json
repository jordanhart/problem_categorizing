Despite the cameras completely stopping any recording merely 60 days after I spent $264 on 2 cameras, and not having any ability to record for the last 60 days, iZon refuses to stand behind their product. How companies deal with situations like this is what differentiates great companies and products from poor ones. iZon, based on this experience, is a poor one. I would avoid buying any of their products.Amazon may want to pull them and discontinue the relationship.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works OK but leaves room for improvement. (UPDATED)", "Author": "DIGITALid", "ReviewID": "R2PDA5G9U2B5J0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE:  After spending some time with it I have decided to update my review.  This device quickly became an absolute nightmare when that glitch appeared in their system that kept replicating the cameras. After weeks of going back and forth with support via e-mail I was told the following.1.  You shouldn't have your SSID hidden.2.  You shouldn't have any dashes or underscores in your SSID.3.  You should consider using basic WEP.?!?  Keep in mind that it worked fine just the way it was before their weird back end glitch.  They deleted my account and we restarted from scratch several times.  That device is now a paperweight.  And a bad one at that since it is so tiny.  $130 wasted.  I'm leaving one extra star because I really like that it uploads to YouTube and hope other companies follow suit.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Good:  The best thing about this device is that it works.  Once you have it up and running it records video and audio.  The motion and audio alarms are a little quirky but they do work.  The YouTube compatibility is a MAJOR PLUS.  All other alternatives are much more expensive.  The camera is surprisingly small and well built.  The magnetic stand is cool and I prefer it to those screw based tilt solutions that loosen after time.The Bad:  The monitoring limitation.  It limits you to 5 minutes at a time when you are viewing remotely which I don't understand.  You tap it again and it starts over.  Perhaps its a heating issue?  Worse part of that is that it rarely works for the full 5 minutes anyway.  It disconnects even when you have 4 or 5 bars seemingly at random.The Ugly:  The setup leaves a lot to be desired.  When you first configure it, the device opens a unsecured wireless hotspot (it doesn't give anyone access to anything but itself) that ANYONE can connect to which is a little unnerving.  If someone recognizes that type of device it isn't beyond the realm of possibility that they could figure out how to connect and then have access to your camera.  I don't know if the camera can be registered on multiple devices.  Once it is set up correctly you can place it on a secured network but its those first few minutes of vulnerability which could be disastrous if you are using this for home security.The Summary:  Some little problems take away from the overall package BUT it really is the BEST solution in this price range right now.  I rarely connect to view for extended periods of time but that YouTube recording makes up for it.  Saving to a private remote account really is the safest bet for home security and for $130 you really can't beat that.  The closest alternative is Dropcam which starts at $200 for video ONLY and NO RECORDING AT ALL.  You can pay $9 a month for 1 week of motion activated backups or $25 for 30 and that really gets expensive very quickly.  iZON does that for free, with audio and for $70 less for the hardware alone!  I only hope they develop a budget outdoor night-vision capable solution soon that is as discreet and easy to use as this camera.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Cool", "Author": "Master \"VET\"", "ReviewID": "R1YI1H5V3EPJWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought mine directly from Stem at a slight higher price than Amazon.

They still haven't provided a time set feature so this is basically useless.  My hope was to have a camera that could record motion at night when everyone is asleep.

Do they actually use their own product, and if so, what for?Bought this at Best Buy, after reading on the box that it has motion triggered video recording and automatic upload to youtube.  What a perfect security camera... Now that I have it unboxed and setup, low and behold: no YouTube upload.  YouTube didn't like the bandwidth demand of this device and no longer allows the upload.  That means this is just a basic webcam with a 20 second delay...yes 20 second delay.  Consider that.  Sit there and count for 20 seconds.  Its completely useless!  Without the ability to record video why would anyone want this?  It should have been taken off of the shelf the day YouTube said \"no more\".

The IZON software did not like that and kept loosing connectivity and kept crashing.I took one airport express and created a new wireless ssid on that in bridge mode and now it is working without much problem. The software still crashes once in a while but tolerable. It seems like IZON was not tested in an extended WiFi network environment.My setup is as follows:Internet----ComcastModem-----TimeCapsule----NetGearEthernetOverPowerLine----AirportExpress (((---))) IZONNote that the airport express is working in bridge mode now with a new WiFi zone.IZON is happy now. I really like the Youtube capture feature. It captures just the right amount of video around the event. I have it on the second floor window facing the street. It does capture whenever a car passes by in front of our house. It works ok at night with street light also.The motion sensor does not seem to be strong enough to trigger on people moving around at that distance.Over all I like the functionality. I wish they can fix issues for an extended WiFi Apple network with Time Capsule and multiple Airport Expresses.I have revised my rating to four star from two. I plan to by one more IZON soon.Following is my original review and the problems I incurred when airport expresses were being used to extend one common WiFi network:It took me 4 hours to configure it and get it working. It would get stuck at the registration screen, where it said that \"it will take five minutes to complete...\". I thought that may be my wireless network had something wrong. I tried eliminating all variables and it still did not work. After about the tenth try using the exact same process it worked and I liked the fact that you could view video on iPhone from anywhere and that it records directly on Youtube upon sound or motion detection.Pros:- Great concept- Good Hardware design- Magnetic base provides flexibility to adjust direction up/down and sidewaysCons- iPhone application crashes all the time- App automatically logs you out once in a while. When you log back in, another instance of the camera is created. My screen had the same camera listed four times- After a couple of hours the camera cannot be reached and needs to be reset- Close to 30 second delay between the event vs. when the it is displayed on the iPhoneOver all too many problems for a production device.

I reset the camera  and started attempts to have the camera read the QR code. After 30 minutes of repeated attempts, I gave up.

I carefully read the user manual to determine what the blinking lights were telling me. I tried the reset procedure numerous times but the device never again recognized the QR code.

I'm a pretty savvy guy technically and I was determined to get this working.I poured over the STEM website looking for a hint or FAQ that would explain what I was doing wrong - very little info was found.

Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and to be honest, I will probably buy a few more of these and hope they are easier to set-up than the first.I saw the negative reviews, and the only reason I went with this camera was the fact that a buddy of mine has the same one.  However, after trouble setting it up, he came over to help and he couldn't figure it out either.However, the customer service is what makes me give this product 1 star.  After doing every troubleshooting step in the manual and additional tips I read from other frustrated users online, I could not get this to show up on my phone.  I even made recommended changes to my wireless network, which required that I re-do every device that uses wireless, which, as you can imagine, was a major pain.  After trying everything in my power, I tried to contact customer service both by phone and email.  They say they will respond within 24 hours, but that is a joke.  When you call, it simply rings a few times and goes to voicemail.  This is the case whether you call at the beginning or end of business hours or anywhere in between.  Trust me, I tried calling all day.  I left messages and sent emails on Jan 6, 7, and 8, and finally heard back on email on the 8th despite asking for a call back in both my emails and voicemails.  Then it turns out that the problem was that the registration didn't complete with their servers, which they were able to fin right away.  This was very frustrating because I spent several hours over 3 days trying to figure this out, and it turns out the error was at their end and was an easy fix.Anyway, this company has a great product, which I will probably buy more of, but they need to add a few more people to work the phones and reply to emails, because waiting 3 days for a response is unacceptable.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "MARCELO O JULIAO", "ReviewID": "RZQR3A2DNUCM3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Gets the job done...

First, the YouTube set up was very difficult and cumbersome.  But, now, that is fixed as IZon now has their own cloud to store your video on, that is not an issue.  I purchased this for my apartment to see if my neighbors enter my unit when I am not home (they have a key for security reasons but were told not to enter unless I asked them to as I am disabled and sometimes need help in the night and needed someone in my building to have a key for that reason only).  I can view my entire living room and kitchen (which overlooks the main door into my place).  It is very easy to set up, even someone lacking the technological aspect of such things can do it.  The quality of the viewing on my iPhone is phenomenal.  I have been in Arizona viewing my apartment in Minnesota without much delay in viewing.  I love this camera as I can now go down and do my laundry and leave my dogs in the apartment and yet know that they are in the apartment and not wondering the halls (my service dog loves to tug my door open and let his little sister wonder the halls when I am not home).  I can also monitor to see if my caretaker enters my apartment without my permission.  I also love that if my PCA's start to give me grief, I can hit a button and record their actions without their knowledge to show to my nurse to get proper action taken.  It is also a piece of mind for my family, I have given them access to view the camera any time they want to check on me or see how my aids are doing with me.  The possibilities with this camera are endless.  And, at the relatively cheap price, you cannot beat it.  A lot of things I have bought to try and make my life easier have been a waste of money, but not this!  I love mine and cannot imagine living without it now.  I think that for people with loved ones that require personal care attendants, this is a must to know that your loved one is being cared for in a proper manor, or for those parents with a baby sitter, this is also a must.  Imagine sitting down for a romantic meal and being able to check in on the baby sitter to be sure they are treating your kids well?  What a piece of mind that would be all at an affordable price.

It's designed to be simple, quick and easy for the average home user.  And with the new software, they've accomplished that pretty well.The firmware makes the video almost live, makes the camera much, much easier to set up, and is much more reliable in general when it comes to notifications/recording.The iphone app is about a 500% improvement.  The old one crashed constantly, could barely play video, and generally was confusing and poorly laid out.The new one is simple to use, has not crashed on me once, made setup for the iZon a snap, and generally leaves me with few complaints.My biggest issue w/ it is that it only uploads 25 videos a day, of about 20 seconds each, which is rather skimpy.

Following the very *non-specific* mini-\"manual\" that came with the cam in the plastic box, etc., and not finding the App where they breezily wrote \"it would be;\" after Googling for it with no useful results in my case....I called AppleCare and an Apple Care rep suggested I directly download the App to my iPhone - and then: there it was...except:After finally installing the App on my iPhone 4, and also had to set up a (new, second?) username, email, ZIP code and PWD to configure it to my home network, the App put up a message in RED TEXT stating, \"WPA2 is the best security....\" ....but it did NOT state that WPA2 is MANDATORY for the IZON to function and see the STEM network - which is REQUIRED to make this thing work - but I guessed I might have to switch to that type of security setting(s) instead of WEP (which is how Verizon set up my home network wireless/wired router for multiple Macs and PCs in Oct. 2011.....which I wasn't sure how to do - or if it was even possible). I called Verizon; they tried to help me switch over to WAP2...but the last step in that process failed to work: the set-up tool for my Verizon FiOS network needed a new/different password to finish the process and none could be gotten or provided. I even tried my original WEP password with the tech support Verizon guy still on the phone... and that didn't work either...so I'm back on WEP now, so at least I still have fast internet access...but still am here with no useable iZON at all.It HAS to be on a WPA2 secure network. Period. I know of no other solutions or work-arounds. I could find none.I will call VERIZON one more time in hopes of switching to WPA2 from the [unusable] WEP security protocols.

Tying to make an iZon work with an Apple iPad or iPhone has been insanely frustrating and a crazy-making experience.

This time the new Stem iPad app 2.2.6 let me set up the account (unlike the first go-around), the app actually found the iZon device (unlike the first go-around), and when I went to give it the password for my Apple WiFi network it wouldn't take the password objecting with a message that asked me to re-set my WPA2 Wifi password with on that only had alphas, numerics, or a period or a hyphen.  Since my WPA password contained both a # and a $ character, I dutifully reprogramed my WiFi with a different password without the offending # or $ characters.

Our economy depends on your confidence!!To my iHomies:I know, Right!? This is exactly like 9/11.To the good workers at Stem:Hang in there. Maybe your boss will sell one of his houses in order to hire a proper-sized staff for this project. I mean seriously, putting a product on Apple Store shelves before even having a proper customer service line in place? I swear, I would even settle for an Indian call center worker at this point.. Outsource, Crowdsource, whatever, just give me some real support. I shelled out $260 for two of these things and now their only as good as your free app.BTW, I leafed through the Stem END USER AGREEMENT for this App. Check out Section II, titled \"SERVICE LEVELS AND UPGRADES.\" Here are some excerpts:Part A, Clause 1: \"STANDARD. STEM Innovation provides a standard level of software functionality for all software for use with equipment. (\"Standard Level\")\"Part A, Clause 2: \"ENHANCED. For certain equipment, STEM Innovation may in the future also offer a higher level of software functionality (\"Enhanced Level\"). There may be a fee (as defined in SECTION VII (\"FEES AND PAYMENT\")) for such Enhanced Level Software, and your timely payment of such Fee shall be a condition upon your use of such software.\"So basically, Stem's business model involves giving their customers an initial sense of confidence by offering their hardware at a trusted retailer (in this case, Apple) and by promising the customer a free, easy to use app in exchange for a high upfront hardware cost (In my case, about $260 since I bought two of these). People spend their money but quickly find their \"Standard Level\" software app to be completely and utterly useless, thereby making their hardware purchase equally useless.Thankfully, it seems Stem is insinuating it will offer these people a way out of their receipt-losing damnation by granting them the opportunity to pay for the appropriate software needed desperately in order for their hardware to actually fulfill its intended purpose (btw this product doesn't have an intended purpose, according to the disclaimer on their website: \"STEM DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\")Sound familiar? Yup, same \"Blame it on the third-party\" BS as before. But of course, Apple's people know nothing about these quality issues right? Their attorneys are too busy suing Samsung and haven't gotten a chance to work with Stem on any potential problems... I'm sure.Mac is finally Microsoft!
