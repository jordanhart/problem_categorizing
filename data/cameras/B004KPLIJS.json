I also posted some sample images.This camera has some unique features. #1 is the ability to shoot intervals. Very few cameras have that feature---I know of only a couple. This allows you to set the camera to take an image every 5 seconds-5 minutes-or 1 hour---etc. You set the time. This is so cool. You can get time lapse movies of the weather changing, clouds boiling, the dogs while you're out, nature shots, a complete dinner party from prep to complete---time lapse is a lot of fun.That said, I HIGHLY recommend this camera.Chris Reich", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "Kari85", "ReviewID": "R31MS6350ZBR70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before choosing the Ricoh CX5, and I was happy with my purchase. I lost my camera on a recent trip and I really miss the thing. I am considering buying another CX5, just because I liked it so much. It definitely helps that the camera is now $150 less than when I bought it. I think it's absolutely worth the money, especially considering the options for comparably priced point and shoot cameras.The camera is a little bigger and heavier than some of the newer, super compact cameras, but it's still small enough to fit in most camera cases or your back pocket. It's heavier because it is made of metal instead of cheap plastic (which I think is a good thing). The great optical zoom also makes for a bigger camera. I think it takes fantastic pictures. It has many options for different settings. Compared to all the other cameras I've owned, this one took the best low light photos. It also took incredible macro photos, and firework photos. Another of my favorite options was the continuous mode.I don't like that the flash is on the same side as the button, because it's very easy to cover with your hand when taking pictures. I got used to it, but almost every time I asked someone else to take a picture, they would cover it. When the flash is set to auto, it often wouldn't go off when it probably should have, resulting in dark photos. Many times, I had to manually turn the flash on, which was annoying.It's really difficult to find a reasonbly priced camera that takes perfect pictures and has all the functions anyone might want. This camera isn't for everyone, but it was great for me! I would highly recommend the Ricoh CX5, expecially for the price.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for outdoor photos.", "Author": "CLB", "ReviewID": "RW2DSDS7QWIX5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Im not the greatest when it comes to taking photos, so I was looking for a point & shot camera with good quality pictures! I found the Ricoh CX5 takes good photos outdoors with not much effort but for indoor photos especially in low lighting you would have to play around with the setting to get it right. This camera was a little more technical then I had hoped for. I was really just wanting a camera I could set on auto & shot away, indoor, outdoor, day or night.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only for beginners", "Author": "Katuska Miletich \"Katuska Miletich\"", "ReviewID": "R2QLQWEHFMGJW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Previous model was excelent.  This one has some defficiencies.  It takes photos yes, but not great ones.  Sometimes it doesnt focus accordingly.  Even flash is in automatic position... Many dark pictures are taken.

Sanborn", "ReviewID": "RWEYFDJLOMQ3W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought the CX5 in September of 2011.It malfunctioned in the spring of 2012.(When I turned the camera off, the lens kept retracting and extending and retracting and extending. The only way to \"turn the camera off\" was to take the battery out.)Ricoh repaired it under warranty for no cost.On December 1, 2012, the camera had EXACTLY the same malfunction.I'm sending it to Ricoh again, but by now the warranty has run out.But I won't pay to have the same repair made twice.If the camera is no good, I am going to buy a replacement from Canon or Nikon.You may not have this problem if you buy one, but thought it would be a good idea to issue this warning.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot", "Author": "Betty McNamee", "ReviewID": "R2U0M2N3UQSTZL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a quality 24/7 camera that was available when my DSL wasn't portable enough.

A blessing because you will never cease to be amazed at what it can do, and a curse because it makes the menus just a little tedious to wade through and find what you are looking for.One thing that is a constant annoyance to me is that the menus are not \"sticky\" - meaning that you have to start from scratch every time you enter the menu - it does not remember where you were 5 seconds ago.As regards image quality, I would say somewhat disappointing. I have had excellent results on occasion - even in poor light, but on the whole I am disappointed. My old 3 MP Olympus point-and-shoot gives consistently better results than the CX5, in spite of the 10 MP selling point.Still, it fits in my shirt pocket, so I can have a camera wherever I go.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004KPLIJS"}}
