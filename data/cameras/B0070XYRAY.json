James", "ReviewID": "RT8EQ501RVJ0Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, like everyone else, I had a brief spurt of panic when I opened things up, browsed through the manual, and then realized that the SD card I held in my hand was the size of the battery and things did not compute.I checked things over, though, and then I realized the microSD card was inside the adapter, and you just had to use your fingers to pull the much smaller memory card out of its adapter.  I then managed to insert the microSD card into my new camera with little bloodshed (Honest, I was missing a finger BEFORE I got the camera... ;)  and have since played around with it some and am happy with my purchase.  I'm enjoying it so far, and, of course, the fact that the camera is PURPLE is icing on the cake.  :)", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "good value, easy to use", "Author": "rebecca beisenstein \"tree crab\"", "ReviewID": "R3FFT3TM7YHWQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a good little camera. in spite of it's inevitable obsolescence, it's was a good buy for the money and the picture quality and features are lots better than the old Kodak it replaced. it came with a case to protect it, which is nice. dropping the last one several times, along with dust problems were the reasons i had to replace the old one.  the battery setup and computer/charger cord are easy and convenient.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kodak M583", "Author": "Joanne Vaughn", "ReviewID": "R2DTB5STVQCGVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast shipmentGreat product to buy at a reasonable priceI just wish the settings were easier to understand how to use.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this camera...", "Author": "dougie", "ReviewID": "R2NB7VPIX3CWDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this about a year ago and am amazed with the quality!

What I like:1) Super tiny and lightweight.  Doesn't take up much room in purse or make it noticeably heavier.2) Battery lasts a long time between charges.  I was concerned about having a camera that had to be recharged v. just replacing batteries, but in spite of the fact that I take between 50 and 100 pictures a week, I've only had to charge my camera 3 times since I bought it 8 months ago.3) Cute color (silly, but true)4) Zoom is good and there are a lot of features regarding photo subject, lighting, etc that make my pictures turn out great.  The color in my photos w/ this camera is even better than my last camera (which was a much more expensive Canon).", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera bundle", "Author": "Patricia Powers", "ReviewID": "R3MUI8PR2J6W7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was much more than I expected.  I have an old Kodak Easyshare and love it, but needed an update.  This camera bundle was offered in an email from Amazon AND it was purple!  I love purple.  The camera is easy to operate, takes great pictures, and the video feature is a hoot.  I really didn't know it had that feature when I ordered it.  The small size is a plus and it all fits in a case the size of a billfold.

Delivery was quicker then I expected and everything was perfect when it arrived and by a few hours I was taking pics.....again, a great quality camera, easy to use.
