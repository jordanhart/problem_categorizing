{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera for Active People", "Author": "A Phile \"Audiophile\"", "ReviewID": "RRAYHONZ3873T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for three months and it has been an excellent camera as far as being lightweight, easy to use, excellent image quality, good battery life except out in the cold.  Keep it warm if you are going to be ourside on freezing days.I am active and I wear this on my belt every day, it doesn't seem any heavier than my cellphone, and it is easy to start up to capture shots that come my way without forewarning.  You could use this camera for bycycling, running, walking, hiking, snowsports, travel and just about anything except swimming, but if you are going to do portraits you will probably want a camera with more manual adjustments.  I wouldn't use it to shoot a wedding, although it would be great as a backup.  The ISO range from 100 to 3200 is really an asset.The video on it is easy to use and is of good quality but not HD.I have big hands, and some arthritis, so I use a very small lightweight tripod for a handle to keep the camera from shaking when shooting video or shots where I cannot brace my arms. The tripod is about six inches long and I screw it into the camera and it give me the extra control, plus if I want to set it up on a tripod I can. This is in addition to the vibration reduction that is on the camera.  The 2.7 inch screen works for me because I want the camera to be light.  I have a digital SLR for more demanding photography, and a HD Camcorder, so this camera fits a slot.", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Get it!", "Author": "Leonard R. Debickero", "ReviewID": "R1KE2J7CG7M3IK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recommend this camera.  Not a photo expert and it is easy to use. A good deal of features I have not yet used or figured out but for ease of use our 9 year old is a master.  Zoom is very good. Right size too. Button feel good to use not cheap. Easy to remove battery pack and photo card slot,(after I read the instructions).  The only fault for this and current cameras the 10MP is not needed for everyday standard photos.  The file size is too large.  Now need software to reduce my photo file sizes for storage.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Shelley Arthur", "ReviewID": "R2CJXB7U82MX4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera on a Sunday and I had it by Wednesday. Fast shipping!! I have only ever owned a Kodak camera and was a little unsure to order my Nikon, but no worries. This camera is excellent. It has a lot of features and different scene modes. Excellent quality of pictures. Very clear and sharp. Very convienent size. Small enough to fit in a small purse but still easy to operate. Very cute and stylish too.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love this camera so much, bought it twice", "Author": "Eileen T. Vester \"eileen\"", "ReviewID": "RWYK1LN1WGG4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally purchased this camera when it was first released, almost two years ago.  It has been the perfect little camera.  We went to the beach this year and unfortunately, as I was walking next to the ocean, a huge wave got me - and my little camera.  It was completely drowned in a second.  When we returned home from the trip, I began searching for this model again.  I found it on Amazon of course!  I didn't even bother looking at other cameras because I love this one.  I ordered it (terrific price), and it was here within a couple of days.  Awesome!I adore the color of this camera's case; it's so beautiful to look at.  It's easy to hold and shoot, and the large display is fantastic.  It shoots gorgeous photos and videos.  There are many, many features which I haven't even used yet because you really have to study the manual to know all of them.  But even with basic use, this camera does all the work for you.  AND it's cute!  Since it comes with a battery charger, it's easy to keep it charged, which is nice.I highly recommend this camera - it's a winner!", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Coolpix 560", "Author": "James Hood", "ReviewID": "R2OMK6A7ND4UIO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The S560 is a full featured, easy to use small camera.

I kept waiting for it to improve.  The ease of buttons and everything is great, nice and compact, has pretty decent features, but the picture quality is very poor, and really - what good are decent features if the end result is poor?  More often than not the pics are fuzzy, poor image stabilization, and poorly lit.  Also the picture turn around time is so slow.  It takes a really long time and I end up missing a lot of shots.  This was purchased after my Olympus had been dropped one too many times by my kids and I've been disapointed in it from the beginning.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera for Normal use", "Author": "Sriram Krishnamurthy \"Sriram\"", "ReviewID": "R2I6OOWQH7D06W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good camera for normal use.
