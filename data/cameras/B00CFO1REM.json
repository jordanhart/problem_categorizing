{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome camera, but doesn't look like the picture.", "Author": "Matt Wendorf", "ReviewID": "RH32GMVCM5UYO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my NX200.  Love the camera, it has all the bells and whistles an aspiring photographer needs.My only gripe(and why I dock a star) is from my disappointment upon opening the box only to see it did not have the retro silver top like the picture suggests.  It was just an all black one like the NX200 I had.Overall I recommend this camera to anyone interested in photography but not wanting to spend the big money.  Just don't buy this one expecting a silver top.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty solid", "Author": "J.

I bought the 210 because I couldn't find a body-only nx300.  For $300 delivered, I did ok.  The 210 feels/handles good, menu's/interface intuitive and clean...and overall performs well.  Picture quality / color accuracy doesn't seem to be quite as good as my NX20.  Also the low-light performance and buffer times shooting raw leave some to be desired, but overall it's a great camera.  I'm happy with it.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CFO1REM"}}
