We were hoping to see Christmas morning from their perspective. So we allowed the kids to open the cameras on Christmas Eve so we could have the cameras ready for Christmas day.  The cameras didn't focus well and the resolutions just were what I expected, Some may ask what did you expect for 39.99 but the camera was on other sites for 69.99 - 89.99 so I was thinking I just got a deal.  I tried to charge these up the night before so my kids would be ready on Christmas morning...ONLY FOR THE CAMERAS NOT TO EVEN TURN ON THE NEXT DAY!!! So having to explain to the kids the cameras didn't work was tough but you know it is what it is. But we sent these cameras back and we are awaiting our refunds.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "VivitarT026-Stopped Working After 15 pictures", "Author": "mtntrtl", "ReviewID": "R2UOB9HZH4R9SO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for underwater (Ocean) photography. It worked fine for 15 pictures, then simply came up with a \"White Screen.\" Nothing I could do would get it going. It also has a HUGE date/time stamp, which is set to be \"on\" if you use all of the default settings. The date time stamp covers fully 1/4 of the bottom of the image. I would definitely not get this camera.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Feels Cheap and plasticy", "Author": "Riaz Baldeo", "ReviewID": "R2D8NKRKRS7LY8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got the Camera and the Box was opened, and the camera seemed very cheap (almost toy-like).
