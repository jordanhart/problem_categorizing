They could not be locked into position -- just a piss-poor design.  These VideoSecu mounts are head and shoulders better than the SVAT mounts.  I have no doubt that they will outlast the electronics and cameras in my new system.  Vastly higher quality, strength, flexibility, and design than the OEM mounts.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap but get the job done", "Author": "Joseph Rafferty", "ReviewID": "R16K7J5NS236LD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have a Defender diy 4 ch dvr setup with cameras and the stock mounts snap so easy the yard is only up 2 months out of the year so they can take moving around much so i got this and i must sayWOW they have a lot and are crazy strong for the money with it came with the dvr seti don't think i will ever damage themfor the money worth every penny", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00451YN3A"}}
