{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not as bad as I first thought", "Author": "Sherri", "ReviewID": "RX4PGG1WG8274", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently dropped my Kodak EasyShare V1253...and I LOVED that camera, which was a bit more expensive than this Vivitar. I was buying a new camera with angst that I even had to, so nothing looked good to me except an exact replica of the camera I just broke. But, I needed a camera pronto, and didn't have the money to buy a higher end camera again. I searched online and read reviews, and was not settled about this camera after reading what folks were saying... not at all! But, my wallet has a pretty loud voice when it's near empty, and it over-ruled what the reviewers said. I cautiously gave this camera a chance. Yep, like them, I hated it at first. Every picture was blurry and had that pinkish tint everyone is talking about. I was going to take it back, but, decided I would take it outdoors, where most of my photos are captured,in order to give it a fair try and see for myself.Now, amazingly, I have to admit to being well pleased. Out of 120 photos I took on my hike, I would say only a handful of them were truly \"bad.\" That is about the same handful that would have been as bad on my Kodak. I admit to spending some time before going on our hike monkeying around with this camera for awhile to get more familiar with it. I even read what certain features were all about by googling words like \"ISO\" and different settings. I found that by selecting the 7mp HD setting, it really helped.  Also keeping the ISO setting as low as possible. Another tip someone gave me, is to hold your breath when you take a photo with a digital camera without a tri-pod, no matter which brand it is. It will help you stay still. ;) I would recommend this to a friend, but would warn them to get really used to it, and know when and how to change settings. If they are hoping to zoom too far away, this camera may not be right for them.Another thing...this is a very light camera. It would be good for taking on trips when you are concerned about weight in your luggage, or when backpacking.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money", "Author": "J. Burgoa", "ReviewID": "R15SUHB4O1C5ZS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought this would be a good deal. I was in need of a decent camera after mine broke in an accident. This one caught my eye in a store flier. Thinking it'd be good, I went ahead and bought it. Big mistake.Now, this camera only had a few features I liked about it. It is very light and very thin, but I suppose that's not something outstanding compared to the newer cameras coming out and the improved features on those, which would include decreasing bulk size as one example. Unfortunately, I cannot come up with any other pros for this camera for the cons far outweigh them.Despite the camera being incredibly light, it feels cheap to hold, as though I'm holding a poorly constructed plastic toy. The major issue I had with this camera is its poor graphics. Don't be fooled by the 10.1MP marketing; the image quality comes nowhere near this level. Also, the slightest movement will cause quite a blur. I found I had to keep both hands absolutely still in order to get a decent shot. I figured there could be no way to keep my hands as still as a statue if I'm out traveling taking photos along the way. I even tried it out while visiting one major city close to home and found about 90% of my shots were nothing more than blurs of color. I couldn't make out anything in those pictures. The anti-shaking feature did not help out at all with the blurred shots.Would I recommend this camera to anyone? No. You'd be better off spending the few extra bucks and getting a better quality camera. It'll save you the headache down the line.", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Huge MISTAKE", "Author": "stephjs", "ReviewID": "R2O76C05638YZW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this after my kodak broke and I needed something small that would fit in my pocket.  I was fooled by the 10.1 MP and anti shake feature.  This camera is horrible and takes horrible pictures, most were blurred and the others came out with a red tint.  I read the directions and went through the settings to make sure I had it set correctly.  This did not help at all.  I will be returning it in the morning.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Won't even charge", "Author": "jason smith", "ReviewID": "RONSW00185R82", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Can't even get the thing to charge up- bought an even cheaper model for our other daughter, and yes it took terrible picts and had a horrible display but it is all hers to drop and toss- of course the younger sister wanted one too ( 3 hrs old) shipping it back.

It has a decent amount of features for a camera this inexpensive. It is a lightweight and small pocket size. Pics have been crisp in various light settings and with different action modes.

I have set the anti shake setting on and also to take multiple pictures in the hopes that 1 is ok.  Also I can not edit the photos even after selecting to unlock all the pictures in the cameras menu.  If there is a way to do it is not intuitive.
