{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Truly Exceptional.", "Author": "Innovator", "ReviewID": "R24UXC79VP0R4S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a pro shooter for 15 years now, and have always used Canon gear. Today, my kit includes the 1Ds Mark III and over a dozen L-series, or special purpose lenses. I can honestly say that this little Leica gives my pro system a run for its money, at a fraction of the cost, and weight. It  also allows me to keep a very low profile if needed, even though this camera is gorgeous.The lens produces astounding sharpness, the color and contrast of the JPEGs are amazing right out of the camera, and yes, the dynamic black and white mode does produce that magical \"Leica feel\" right out of the camera. I was skeptical at first, however, even after one sunset test shoot, I would also agree with other users on this point. At 460k, the LCD screen has ultra high resolution, while all camera operations are quite fast. It's simply an incredible camera.As for the cons that other users mention...in my opinion, no, the mode dial is NOT that easy to accidentally turn. Once you pick up the camera you'll see that your index finger, once poised over the shutter button, simply won't be close enough to the mode dial for an accidental spin. Also, the autofocus for spontaneous shooting, even in low-light is also plenty fast enough, and does not unnecessarily go hunting for subjects, in my opinion.CONS: (1) Do not waste your money on the optional 24mm viewfinder. The optics, even at $350, do not zoom to match whatever focal length the lens happens to be at, which forces you to shoot at 24mm each and every time, which sort of defeats the purpose of having a zoom lens capability. Additionally, it does not even offer shoot information in the display, unlike a DSLR which does this and makes traditional viewfinder shooting possible.(2) Don't waste your money on the Leica battery. Instead, buy the one for the Panasonic LX3, which is identical, only it doesn't say Leica and costs about half as much. The principle of Leica charging more without giving you any additional battery capacity simply irritates me.OPTIONAL: I did splurge for the brown leather Leica case. It's a little overpriced to be sure, but if you've read this far, then you're someone willing to pay $700 for a point and shoot anyway, so you might as well just complete the package. It's pure class all the way around. If your goal was also to bask in Leica social cachet, then this case completes the package. If you're a pro shooter, then it also provides instant reassurance to your clients that yes, \"this guy is actually pulling out a point and shoot camera on this shoot, but oh wait, it looks like a serious machine. It's all good.\"In the end, I promise you will NOT be disappointed. This little gem is worth the money, and has definitely earned the following it has already attained.Happy shooting...~WC", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Leica has cachet", "Author": "Ellie \"Eilean Siar\"", "ReviewID": "R359H63AYQ63DQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even with the $150 rebate (until end of 2008) I paid $200 for the red dot. Mind you, I'm not complaining. It is an estimable camera at the top of the heap in its class. I bought it for the f2.0 fast lens, the wide angle, the build quality, the Leica processing software in the camera itself (it is better than my Panasonic DMC-LZ50 - less chunky and exagerated color at extreme magnification), the accessories like even more wide angle with an accessory lens or the 24mm optical finder. I have done some photojournalism in my life and this is what I wish I had back then.I have gone through at least four digital cameras since I decided to leave my Nikon film SLR on the shelf a few years ago. I have never looked back. But this beauty allows me to do the photography I like best, to be inconspicuous, to be quick, to feel like taking it along because of its relatively light weight and size, to not spook people who are shy when an SLR is around. It looks (other than that wonderful red dot) like any P&S;, but I'm thankful it isn't.I've seen minimal barrel distortion, maximum sharpness and contrast, easy menus, abundant automatic as well as full manual features.Unless you have a fetish about Leica, go with the much less costly extra batteries (under $15.00) and other items. A tip about non-Leica brand batteries:  remove the stick-on label because it is just thick enough to make it difficult to remove these after market batteries. When I did this, they fit just as well as the Leica ($75.00) batteries. Get the S005 battery that the Panasonic twin uses. These aftermarket are just as good as maker branded batteries. Get a few of them. They charge up in just 45 minutes or so.I have used the 720P HD video (use the wide 16:9 format at the right side of the lens barrel selector switch) and am impressed at the quality. Certainly a dedicated 1080P HD videocam would do better, but being able to use a 24mm wide angle lens is a real plus. On my digital TV and on my computer monitor the results were satisfying. My computer played it with a little stutter the first time but playing it again it was smooth on succeeding times. Go figure. I have a low end graphics card so that may be the cause. My HD videos have been less than one minute so far - I understand there may be a limit of five minutes or so (per file). Don't buy another still camera without HD video!A tip about what some pros and advanced amateurs do with a quality new camera to preserve its resale value is to cover as much surface on the camera as possible with adhesive plastic (such as the PDA screen protector materiel) to minimise wear (and actually, it gives you a better grip than the stock exterior). This is for a user camera. If, like some Leica owners, you just want to show it off rarely for the feeling that you know enough about cameras to choose a Leica you can skip this tip.Oh, one thing. Do not trust the Leica neck strap. It almost came loose at the camera end while on its first use. Use a sailor's knot there - don't trust the tiny plastic sleive to hold. We don't need any Leicas hitting the concrete.UPDATE for August 2011Just downloaded the ROM 2.2 D-Lux 4 upgrade to its operating system. Go to the Leica Germany website to download it, unzip, move the file to an empty SD card recently formatted on the camera. install the card, turn on camera and follow directions given. Hardly takes a minute. Numerous upgrades to features including square format. E-mail Leica USA service department if you have any questions. No need to get a D-Lux 5 for many of the new features except 90mm which this upgrade does not, and cannot, address. Just crop by a third or so to get 90mm equivalent.", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "I've never had a camera I truely loved until I tried this one!", "Author": "Richard Fisher \"Louisiana Audiophile\"", "ReviewID": "RI7CKSPS6FSUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most cameras are usually something I tire of after a few days of use.

This is the camera for the rest of us who want to take great photo's and gave up because of complicated cameras. The LCD screen also has a higher resolution than the point and shoot cameras I've used (many). The flash will also handle most lighting conditions with ease although the lens is fast enough that rarely have I used the flash.

None what so ever. I started my search for a perfect (to me) P&S; about a couple of months ago and have gone through most of the top of the line Canons. In my opinion, Canon makes the best cameras in the market. However, none of the compacts has come even close to my expectations. Then I decided to take the plunge, went to the dark side and ordered the D-Lux 4. Before this, I considered the Panasonic DMC-LX3. May be the LX3 does the same thing, but I am tired to being disappointed and shipping cost to return items. Just a note, I also own a Canon 5D Mkii, Canon A620 and Panasonic LX-2, these are excellent cameras and produce amazing images.I only shot the D-Lux 4 for only about a week, but I already know that I will keep this camera. I love it so much, the 60mm maximum focal length and plastic battery door are non-issues for me. BTW, those were the only complaints I heard for other owners. The colors in Vibrant mode are gorgeous; Dynamic B&W; produces images that are rival to those shot in B&W; with a filmed Leica. Very acceptable lag time too. 24mm minimum focal lenght and f2.0 make tremendous differences. Not as fast as an DSLR, but I believe it is as good as you can get with a P&S.; The large image sensor (largest in P&S;, except Sigma DP1) produces images that have virtually no noise. I shot mine at ISO 80.Someone said these Leica cameras have better resale values. I am not so sure. But if it is, I can certainly see why. Right now, I have no intetion of parting with it. This camera also comes with 2-year warrantee and that makes the price a little bit more bearable. I was willing to pay almost $500 for the Canon G10. This camera leaves the G10 in the dust. I am paying a premium price for a compact P&S;, but have no regrets.4/24/09 update: HD video is great, except for the following:1. Only 10m30s each, even there is still plenty of space on the SD card.2.

I ended up getting the Titanium edition set, which includes a mathcing \"ever ready\" case, but in practice I find the standard black leather case easier to use (yes, bought that too!).What I was not expecting was the significant upgrade of every aspect of the camera when compared to the D Lux 3.  The menus, effects, \"film\" selection options, indeed every aspect of the operation of the camera is significantly improved over the D Lux 3 (which BTW is still available as a current model). I was also very pleased with the lens performance - combined with the new (larger) sensor, it too represents a big improvement over the D Lux 3, which is also a very good performer.The only disappointment has been the external optical viewfinder.  Very expensive and hard to use - you cannot focus through it nor see any of the shooting data that appears on the LCD screen - it really is just a viewfinder and only useful for composing the photo. One still has to use the LCD screen for focus and data.  The viewfinder also only represents the widest lens setting but I did know that when I bought it.  Also, you have to attach the viewfinder every time you use it because the camera will not fit in any of the available cases when the veiwfinder is attached.  To date there is no case available for the viewfinder either, other than the little pouch that comes with it.So, buy the camera by all means and enjoy the excellent images and quality look and feel of the device itself.  Get one (or more!!) of those excellent cases as well, but I would suggest against buying the optical viewfinder - it's limitations mean that you will very rarely bother using it and you may as well save several hundred dollars!", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Mini Leica for the Knowledgeable Photographer", "Author": "Herbert Benkel \"NY Lover\"", "ReviewID": "RPLDDGW6PLKWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a semi professional photographer who has always been a supporter of Leica. This new version of the Leica is even a kick for those who have an M-8 but want a quality, wide angle capable, and fully adjustable mini Leica to carry everywhere. In it's 'standard black and white' mode it is uncanny how the images have the \"Leica feel\". The \"Leica feel\", for those who don't know, is the unique feel and image quality that you can only understand if you have used a Leica for many years. This camera is terrific in available light. There is very little vibration from the shutter. This is aided by vibration reduction, but is more obvious here than in other cameras with VR. There is some distortion in the most wide angle images but if you are careful with how you shoot it's not any problem.Over all this is a wonderful, but expensive toy for more serious photographers.", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - Excellent Images - Miserable LCD Viewfinder", "Author": "Leo A.

Image quality is superb, shadow detail, colour, B&W; plus the ability to bracket multiple film types are just the beginning. User controls are a bit small but highly functional &  intuitive. ISO is highly usable up to 400 beyond which the usual compromises begin to take hold. The speed of the lens at f2.0-f2.8 combined with the image stabilization system makes for the BEST low light camera I have had the pleasure of using. The focal length 24-60mm is quite usable-- need 10x this is not the camera for you - use your feet get up move around compose, try different viewpoints - its called photography -- experiment let the limits nudge you into your more creative side. Multi- Format 4:3 3:4, 16:9 allow for a lot of creative possibilities and experimentation. I don't understand some of the complaints from other users and reviewers about barrel distortion - I have not seen it as a problem - unless you are more interested in technicalities of the device rather than the outcomes and the pleasure of a well composed photograph. The grid line option in the viewfinder is a god send for properly aligning and composing.Now the only complaint and it is a major one is the LCD VIEWFINDER IS Useless in most daylight situations. It totally defeats the ability of carefully composing and constructing a well taken photo. The LCD is more like a mirror rather than a viewfinder. I realize Lieca had to make some compromises in terms of size and all BUT this is ridiculous. I tried the 24mm hot shoe viewfinder - very useful if all you shot is 24mm otherwise at half the cost of the camera hardly worth it. The only acceptable although somewhat kludgy solution comes from The Hoodman - product name is the HoodLoupe3.0 with the cinema strap option for attaching the Loupe. Actually works quite well once I figured out how to attach with minimum interference on the cameras miniature controls. Obviously increases the size of the kit quite a bit but it essentially turns the d-lux 4 into a mini digital view camera !!!  So given the obvious compromises I still give the D-Lux 4 a 5 Star rating- why because life is full of compromises even if you had unlimited resources - we as consumers need to stop looking for perfection in things and focus on whats important in life - whatever your choices - Enjoy and stop fusing over meaningless specs and measurements in the end the photo is what  matters.

Amazing sharpness and clarity on indoor and outdoor shots on P and A mode and there are several  pro modes to try. Superb pictures up to ISO 400 without flash. Just awesome!!!. Its F2.0 lens does the trick and is bright, sharp and precise, and the 24-60mm LEICA lens (the only point and shoot in the world to have 24mm range along with Panasonic)  is fantastic. For creative and memorable shots, this camera will simply beat any high end point and shoot or compact camera in the world in terms of sharpness, clarity and contrast as it has an unusually large sensor.

A+ built and finish, way different than the Panasonic counterpart which uses Lecia lens. This camera has Leica's own JPEG processing engine for superb clarity and contrast. It costs around $900 (price is a little high) but its Leica and a head turner, and does what it is supposed to do....take breathtaking point and shoot pictures at an amazing 24-60mm zoom range.

I wish it had a handgrip and optical viewfinder and would not mind some increase in size to accommodate these. I had a Canon G7 a few years ago and recently upgraded to the G10 and am very happy with it also. It is significantly larger but has a handgrip and an optical VF. The latter is only fair but it does zoom and once you factor in its limitations it is quite usable, despite the negative reports. I think that the image quality is similar, with a slight edge to the DL4. Because of its smaller size and fast wide lens I find myself using it more than the G10 (but use the G10 more when outdoors).

This camera with it's `ever ready' case weighs about 14 ounces.  My dSLR kit with 3 lenses, a TC, and a flash weighs about 25 pounds.  A tripod (carbon fiber), long lens, and macro lens adds close to 15 pounds.  I hiked up the lakefront last week carrying the 25 pounds, and it got a lot heavier about half way through, downright painful.  If I wanted to spend a day at the zoo I'd take everything, so I'd be lugging around 40 pounds.  This is a great mental block to getting out, and it's a whole lot easier to throw 14 ounces in my jacket pocket.  I also really noticed that with my dSLR people were very aware of the camera, and with the Leica people didn't even notice me, making it a lot easier to capture candid `street' photography.So, what do you give up for this portability?  Surprisingly little.  The only things I can think of are the ability to change lenses and a smaller sensor size.The lens is fantastic, starting at f/2.0, being so fast that in sunlight I could not get the shutter speed slow enough at f/11 to smoothen water or blur moving objects such as a train.  I've already ordered an Opteka 52mm adapter so I can use my existing CP and ND filters. Panasonic also has a wide angle lens adapter.  There is no telephoto adapter, that would be a welcome addition.  The lens introduces very little distortion, buildings and trees actually look straight.  I had another `famous lens maker' P&S; that had so much distortion that it made flagpoles look like pretzels.The camera shoots RAW and JPEG and RAW+JPEG in varying sizes and quality.  I really wanted RAW files, that's all I shoot with my dSLR, and I really like the non-destructive and enhanced editing features you get with RAW.  It comes with a full version of Phase One's Capture 4, which looks pretty sophisticated, or the files can be read and rendered by CS4 and Lightroom 2.  You can change the shooting aspect ratio, focus mode, and even the simulated film type to match Leica film cameras including B&W.;What I consider to be the biggest feature of this camera is the firmware.  The camera will shoot in the very easiest to use up to sophisticated options as well as video.  The `snapshot' mode picks out what type of scene you're shooting and adjusts everything accordingly, you do nothing. `Scene' mode lets you pick from 23 predefined settings like `baby', `party', starry night', etc.  Then there are the standard Program (which you can shift using the joystick), Aperture priority, Shutter priority, and Manual modes.Even with the latest firmware version which is supposed to fix white balance detection, it is not good.  dpreview notes the bad fluorescent settings, and I noticed that even shooting a flower patch resulted in a different WB depending on the color of the flowers in the scene.  Luckily, there are 4 ways around this problem, 1) shoot RAW and adjust in the renderer, 2) set WB manually on the camera, 3) set WB temperature in the ROM, 4) set a WB preset by reading a white piece of paper in the shooting light.  Even my dSLR gets confused with WB, the problem is not unique to this camera.Other dSLR type features:  Exposure bracketing, Flash output bracketing, Burst mode, Custom settings (2), Rear curtain flash sync, AF tracking, etc.  To see a full list of features, you can download the camera manual from Leica.Negatives: The accessories are incredibly overpriced.  A viewfinder that is little more than a hollow tube is almost half the price of the camera.  I'd like to have it to steady the camera against my face, but I won't spend that much on it.  The battery is twice the price of the Panasonic battery, which is 3 times the price of a generic battery.  The `ever ready' case costs more than a lot of people want to spend on an entire camera.Forget about a Leica flash, buy a 3rd party one for the LX-3 with more output.  While the body of the camera is made of sturdy metal, the I/O and Battery/SD doors are cheap plastic.  I'm really careful with the battery door.  While I haven't had any problem accidentally moving the mode dial when pressing the shutter as a few people have reported, the camera is a little hard to hold.  It would have been nice to have a built in handle like the LX-3 or at least include the now optional handle with the camera.  If you do buy the handle, it will not fit in the ever ready case.  The case itself has some problems which I'll address in a separate review.So, can this camera replace a dSLR? Yes, with the reservation that there is not a long lens available.  The options common with a dSLR are there.  The image quality is there.I have a couple of other P&S;'s and I rarely use them mostly due to distortion, noise, slow lenses, and lack of RAW capability.  I'm not willing to haul around 25 pounds everyday, but I keep the Leica next to the door ready to go.Is the camera worth the money?  A qualified maybe.  It depends on how much you value two hundred dollars, that's the premium over a LX-3 or G11.  Then you have to consider whether you are going to add accessories and if they will be genuine Leica accessories.  The whole system is getting near fifteen hundred dollars.  The two hundred does mean something to me, but if you're going to pay as much for a P&S; as you are an entry level dSLR you might as well go for the Leica.

I'd add: it's a perfect Cartier-Bresson digital camera. If you get the hang of it, even the shutter lag won't prevent you from capturing a decisive moment. Because of the size and the optics, it has a tremendous depth of field, and the in-camera stabilization gives one a Noctilux equivalence in low light (alas, without the bokeh). Yes, M9 takes better pictures but it uses interchangeable lenses and is not \"pocketable,\" not to mention its $9000 price tag (body only!). Among the compact rangefinders, I know canon G10 has more pixels at lower ASA but this Leica D-Lux 4 beats it at the higher ASA (really noticeable at 200ASA), and besides, G10 is so bulky and heavy that one might as well get an SLR! The price difference between the D-Lux and its Panasonic equivalent (LX3) is worth it, because of the warrantee (3 years on the leica) and a much better processing software that comes with it. Some actually claim that Leica has better colors, etc. A long-time used of Contax G rangefinders, I was excited to see the appearence of two thirds digital rangefinders from Panasonic and Olympus and even considered replacing my dlux 4 with the panasonic's new GF1 (3/4th format) with a pancake lens becasue of the Panasonic's bigger sensor. In the end, I decided against it - because of leica's versatility and compactness: its 24-60mm f2-f2.8 zoom, with a great macro, wins over the GF1 which becomes as unwieldy as a DSLR, once it is equipped with its own zoom lens. And if compactness isn't an issue, why bother with a rangefinder when you can get a light-weight canon DSLR (Ti2) with a great Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom (24-60mm equivalent on an APC DSLR), and a normal 50 mm f1.7 Canon lens which become a nice portrait lens (a fast 70 mm on an APC DSLR).Note also that Leica D-Lux 4 is faster focusing and better shot-to-shot timing than another minor cult classic, Sigma DP2 (a fixed focal lens camera, in any case).Then, there is now the new Leica X1, with an APC-size sensor. But unlike D-Lux 4, with its 24-60 mm zoom, X1 is a fixed 35 mm focal length camera. When I still used film (Contax G), my \"normal\" lens was 28 mm, with occasional switch to 45 mm and the portrait 85 mm). Leica d-lux 4 covers most of this range and better - all the way to 24 mm film equivalent! When you travel, you want a 24 mm lense to get the whole place in one shot, taking advantage of its incredible depth of field. And the 60 mm gives you a nice portrait tele effect. If you set up carefully, it even allows you to throw the background out of focus (for those who must have the bokeh effect).I've had my Leica D-Lux 4 for a year and a half and traveled half-way around the world with it, leaving my canon dslr with its very nice and very expensive 17-40 mm, f4, zoom (costs more than panasonic's new GF1 with its f1.7 aspherical) at home. Unlike a DSLR, D-Lux 4 allows you to be completely unobtrusive and grab any shot anywhere - whether you are in a crowded bus or a quiet church. Compared with it, my Canon DSLR, with its 17-40 mm zoom (equivalent focal lens coverage but f4 v. leica's f2) is a noisy and offensive monster.There is only one drawback: because of the optics of the small sensor cameras, it is almost impossible to get a nice bokeh effect - the kind one can get with a fast telephoto on a dslr (I use the 50mm f 1.7 on my canon that gives me a 70mm full sensor equivalent) when you want to isolate your subject by throwing everything else out of focus (especially good for portraits). So I keep my Canon dslr and the normal lens for those occasions.In short, after using it for 18 months and taking thousands of pix, i give leica d-lux 4 five stars. it's perhaps the hardest camera to supersede in this crowded market, and if you want to take pictures, street, architecture, scenics, macro with a pocket-size camera, you don't really have a choice: leica d-lux 4 is it.And by the way, it does HD video, too!(Updated 7/13/2010)", "Date": "December 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "compared against Canon G10 and Panasonic LX3", "Author": "hellfire", "ReviewID": "R28HW06M6S0DHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "be sure to go to [...]to get the latest firmware.  it improves white balance and adds 1:1 aspect ratios.  my straight from amazon gift had firmware 1.1, which is several revisions old.Although the LX3 and d-lux4 are basically the same camera, you do get a few extras:+ significantly better industrial design :)+ phase one capture one raw processing software - this is a pro-level raw processing tool by a medium format manufacturer that outclasses most other tools out there.  i love it.+ 3 yr warranty - register on [...] to get the extended warranty+ marginally less processed JPEGs+ cachetin all, i think the first 3 points make the $200 premium over the panasonic LX3 worthwhile.i've been a canon shooter my entire life (EOS 1Ds, G10, SD790IS make up my current arsenal), so i feel comfortable with this comparison:d-lux4 vs G10:+ astounding lens. wide open aperture (f2.0) is still sharp but great low/available light performance.  there are shots only this compact or an SLR with a large lens (or the new GF1) can take.

Panasonic makes it, completely, 100%. The whole thing. Box and all. So yes: it has, surprise, a 'Made in Japan' label! It is functionally identical to the LX3,  give or take a tweak or two to the firmware. It just costs a lot more only except that:Either Panasonic misjudged the demand or it is about to replace the LX3, which is therefore currently back-ordered by Panasonic, so it costs, from various predatory camera stores smart enough to have stockpiled it, as much as the Leica.Benefit of Leica: significantly better case design and nicer packaging  - certainly to my eye. Brand appeal. Benefit of Panasonic: half the price until recently and firmware updates come a month earlier than Leica's tweak which may or may not add any value.No other way Leica can actually differentiate their private label version, frankly. both are otherwise technical identical right down to the terrific little lens that Panasonic pays a license fee to Leica to use their name on and just possibly Leica had some role in its design.Am I against Leica? Not at all. I have and love their M6, and love their product design and cachet. And their M series lenses are extraordinary. Indeed, historically their optical and mechanical engineering was without parallel.But let us please, please call a spade a spade and not talk about the D-Lux as some incredible German masterpiece.It is a truly, absolutely fantastic Japanese camera designed and manufactured by Panasonic.PS: as the very, very happy owner of an LX3 I am even thinking of getting a D-Lux 4 and giving my LX3 to one of my kids.

For example, depth of field for portraits - just couldn't get the right bokeh (blurred backgrounds), and natural light photography was challenging at best (lots of noise above ISO 400).

To me contrast is the most important principle of design and crucial in making the art exciting and of high quality. I don't care about cameras that have all the fancy features, even produce sharp image, but as far as contrast - completely dead. I grew up on Rolleiflex 6x6 with Schneider 80 mm f2.8 (the best camera ever). Then I gave it to a missionary friend not knowing what I had. Later, after getting same looking camera, I noticed after about 10 rolls that something was wrong with contrast. After close look, it came to me that it had a different lens \"Carl Zeiss\" . . . (don't take me wrong it's sharp from Zeiss but different contrast,  . . not for me . .). I was so stupid not look carefully on the lens while buying it in used store (they look almost same). Building my own enlarger as a little boy, done a lot of work in darkroom, image manipulation, work with many different filter and many special techniques helped me to train my eye for contrast. I teach black and white, digital photography and also AP Studio Art 2D Design in high school. To me what makes picture to be real picture; is the optic on the lens, not the features on the camera. The coding on the glass and optic itself determines the contrast and foretells the quality of anticipated results. The image that is reflected through optic on the focal plane of a film or on chip, picks up on its way into the camera the contrast that is inscribed by the optic and its coding. Leica's optic is very highly reflective glass that enables and empowers the image with breathtaking contrast. If you don't necessary care about contrast and great color balance, but want to still have sharp pictures without life, then get C . . . . (I don't want to drop a bomb, ha, ha . .)Leica D lux 4 is a nice little camera with outstanding quality of image that comes very close to the level of Schneider glass.

It was my primary camera for that entire period. In full disclosure, the camera that preceded it was the Nikon D90, and the camera that came after was the Canon T2i. In comparison to the D90, the D-Lux 4 was a happy replacement...At first. I was thrilled to be getting such great images from such a tiny device. It was great...At first. I quickly became restless at its limitations. Namely, noisy low-light photographs and the limiting process of control over manual functions like focus, aperture and shutter speed. It was made up for in size and the ability to sneak shots, but even that was soon compromised. Inside of the Supreme store in LA, I was dragged into a discussion about Leicas with the salesperson, still unable to get any shots of the inside of the store, the same for Union LA, except the staff was less friendly. Even the shots I was able to sneak were noisy and no where near professional in their results. Flash forward to today to me and my diminutive T2i and a 50mm prime. The body is small, light and I get the same amount of attention I would the Leica, yet I can get a professional result regardless of the situation and light environment. So, in conclusion, I think buying a camera is largely a personal endeavor that should be about what you need a camera for specifically. As a photographer, you will find that you really don't need much more than simply a camera that gets the job you want done reliably. The Leica D-Lux 4 takes great photographs, but it cannot replace a DSLR, this is something I found out the hard way.

This is fairly expensive for a camera without interchangeable lenses, etc. It is much smaller than the Canon G11, which is cheaper. There is now way to add any filters, since there is no threading for this on the lens. I confirmed this with Leica today. I normally put a filter on an expensive lens right away. This camera can shoot in RAW, so you can use it with Photoshop. I think it is worth the price. One other consideration for those looking for a fine camera that is small would be the Panasonic GF1 or the soon to be released Olympus EP2. These take interchangeable lenses, including some made by Leica. These cameras are larger though and cannot go into a coat pocket.

So I made sure I could add a grip to facilitate one-handed shooting.  I can.  And I bit.The D-Lux 4 arrived and I have put it through several rounds of at least casual tests. Here are the highlights and the lowlights.First off, I loathe and despise the lens cap.  What were they thinking?!?!  When someone buys a compact camera, they are usually intending to use it as an SLR *replacement* (read: a camera one can walk around with and pull out and have ready to go at a second's notice in those spur of the moment photojournalistic situations, *not* a camera you have to spend five minutes prepping and fiddling with to be able to even snap the shutter). Before I figured out to just ditch the lens cap (more on that below) I wasted a lot of time removing the lens cap each time to take a picture.  And I grew to greatly resent the insane amount of time I had to spend trying to get the lens cap put back on the lens--since if I weren't careful I ended up grazing my thumb over the surface of the lens in the process.  &%$#To make a long story short, if you want to use this as a \"quick draw\" camera you pull out on a moment's notice to instantaneously capture those decisive moments (and it is small enough to carry in a purse), then I would suggest buying the Canon Deluxe Soft Case PSC-85 velcro closure case for it and just ditching the lens cap.  When you're shooting, you won't want the lens cap on anyhow.  And when you've got the camera in the case, the case will protect the lens.  (The Leica brand ever-ready case, by contrast, is incompatible with this camera if you've got the Leica grip affixed and, also, has some other design flaws that you can read about that in my review of the Leica case.)So Leica should have figured out to build in one of those those auto-retractable iris covers for the lens, but I finally found a work-around that works for me.Probably the most significant positive is the camera's low-light capabilities.  My Panasonic Lumix DMC FX-01 could never get much of anything in the dimly lit bar I visit weekly with friends.  And I refuse to use the flash in such situations, since then pictures have that icky washed-out look.  Not to mention it annoys your subject(s) and renders all shots posed rather than candids.  The Leica D-Lux 4 handles beautifully in low light.  OK, a little noise, but not so much that you can't bear to look at the shot you've taken.  I'd rather take the shot and have it be a bit noisy than not take it at all.  One never knows when that'll be the last shot one gets of this, that or the other pal.  People move out of town...  My old Panny,even set at its highest ISO setting and with exposure compensation turned all the way up to +2 just could do nothing in low light. As in, we're talking a black rectangle for the resulting image capture.  The D-Lux 4 is a camera I am now so grateful to have in my life, for the low-light capabilities alone.I love the wide angle. That was a primary selling point for me. Although this is not a perspective corrected lens, so prepare for, say, door frames to take on that fish-eye look if they're at all near the edge of the frame in your image.  There's no substitute for wide-angle.  I like the wide-angle lens.But I regret the almost total lack of zoom.  Be prepared for that before you commit to buying it.  Brace yourself.  I thought I had braced myself, but apparently not enough.  I experience regret on the lack of the camera's zoom almost every time I shoot with it.Battery life has been fine.  No complaints.  Charger works fine, and quickly.Joystick takes some getting used to but when it works, it works.  As in, I can use it to adjust exposure compensation without having to burrow through menus.  That I like.  But I get frustrated there's some seeming logical inconsistencies with which modes one can use the joystick to adjust the aperture in and which modes one cannot.I like the ability one has to limit how high the camera will take the ISO.  Nice.  And any camera worth its salt will (as this one does) let the user specify the camera is disallowed from using \"digital zoom,\" since digital (as opposed to optical) zoom is a scam.  All that is is in-camera cropping.On balance, I feel ambivalent.  I would say I feel grateful to have the camera in my life because of what it can do.  For low-light shooting, it's great.  But I don't enjoy this camera. It's so bulky it takes up over half my purse (time, I guess, to become one of those women who carry those obnoxiously large handbags--ugh). And many shots I find I just forgo since it is such a hassle to wrestle the camera out of the somewhat snug case.  And I find myself often frustrated I can't get what I need due to the lack of zoom.But it has been only recently I finally solved the lens cap problem.  So I am going to continue to shoot with the camera and I anticipate liking the camera more and more now that I am over my lens cap resentment.

Also bought  Nikon d5000 to compare and pick one of them. Well , for me like for many of you the image quality and the color are on the first place. The Leica  is the best for sharp and great colors in outdoor shooting  even in auto mode. As for indoors  , the images are fine if there is a good day light ,  though as soon as it gets darker, the pictures will start getting  visible noise,  but worst  thing  is yellow-greenish tint on the pictures. Adjusting  WB and other light corrections are not much of a help - the images are still tinted with that yellow cast.Night shots are sharp, but again the street lights  and lit up streets don't have true colors: the  greenish tint is everywhere. In one word the colors in Leica are different from what  you taking.Another big minus is flash: it's too bright that makes everything washed out and gives a \"dead\" look.LCD gives a very bright, too saturated images and in sunny days you need to put some shields over it to see what you are shooting.There are other minor negatives but you can, probably, get  used to them: slippery body, small to hold, even for my little woman's hands, some of the menu features are awkward comparatively my Sony's.Such a disappointment. My old P/S sony cybershot gives far better colors in lcd , pc and prints. The only problem is it doesn't have an image stabilizer.As for D5000, the colors are great: what you see, that you get in the camera and prints. However, the sharpness is not as in the Leica dlux4 unless you use tripod or other support. Indoor pictures are very pleasing without any effort even in quite dark rooms.  Manual  mode gives even better results. White balance has a wide range, plus color correction which Leica lacks .Great images with flash.Easy to use menu not mentioning flexible LCD .A little bit big for me even though it's lighter and smaller than Canon DSLRs .Now I am thinking to go back to Sony  but  with image stabilizer and  decent sensor size  for compact cameras.Ema", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "No viewfinder problem", "Author": "billja", "ReviewID": "R1LV1PQNMJABVG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have played many times with this camera in my local store.

To do that you have to put on your reading glasses to see the screen clearly, by then the desired shot has passed ! There is an accessory viewfinder but it is big and clumsy, defeating the 'point and shoot' capability and is only really functional at 24 mm so the zoom portion is excluded.
