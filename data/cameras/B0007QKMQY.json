The battery comes partly charged so you can immedietly start using the camera (thank you Canon!)  I've already shot about 200 pictures with it and the battery hasn't died yet.I can't give you a comparison between the XT and the 20D as I haven't owned a 20D, I can tell you a few things you may wish to know before buying.This camera, is TINY.  Extremely tiny.  I'm a woman in my early twenties and I have small hands.  The camera fits just right in my hands, but honestly, I don't see how someone with bigger hands would be 100% comfortable holding this.  If my hands were any larger, they would be slipping off the bottom.I had tried holding a 20D at a camera shop once and it felt too large  in my hands to grip.  The camera size is perfect for me, but just beware if you have larger hands.  You may want to look into the battery grip, or test out holding the camera at a store before you order it.  See the picture I uploaded above to get a size relation and how the camera fits in my hands.For anyone who is migrating to this camera from a standard point and shoot digital camera, you cannot frame the image you are about to take using the LCD screen on the back.  You must look through the viewfinder.  The LCD screen is soley for menu use and preview mode after the picture has been taken, nothing more.Something I've noticed is the camera makes a ratteling sound when moved around.  I couldn't figure out what the heck it was, and then I finally reazlized it's the hinges from the pop-up flash.  It sounds like they are loose when the flash is closed.  I went to Best Buy and looked at their display model, and yep, it has the same problem.  Well, it's not really a *problem* but frankly something ratteling around like that sounds cheaply made to me.  My Canon film SLR doesn't make that sound.I use a 420EX Speedlite flash with my SLRs so the popup flash doesn't concern me, but it was something I noticed and thought I would share.I love that Canon gave the option to have a black finish over a silver one.The startup time is instantaneous which is absolutely wonderful.The burst mode is excellent with 3 fps.It's extremely quiet.The image quality is excellent.  You can get photo quality prints at 20x30, and even then I bet you could push it further.I really can't elaborate more then what other reviews have said.  If you are looking for a step into the digital SLR world, this is the ticket.  Or you can even check out the newly reduced original Digital Rebel, but for the extra hundred bucks or so, I would just get the XT.  You will not be sorry.Two upgrades I would make right away: Get a Speedlite flash and the Canon 28-135mm lens.Also, I don't know why people are submitting bad reviews grading Amazon on shipping for the Rebel XT.  When I preordered the XT from Amazon (not from another 3rd party), it said it would be released March 20th.  I got my Rebel XT in the mail yesterday (the 22nd) which if you ask me, is pretty darn good.  Want something right away?  Then walk into a store and buy it instead of ordering from the internet.", "Date": "March 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "A review for the", "Author": "M. L.

Do NOT confuse this with the Digital Rebel (non-XT)starter kit, which is also for sale.Canon 420 EX FlashSanDisk CF Type II (1 GB)Canon Semi-hard Case (EH-18L)Canon Remote Controller (RC-1)Experience:Currently 34 years old, began taking pictures at age 10 with non-SLR type cameras.  Previous cameras include Canon AE-1 Film SLR, Sony Mavica MVC-FD90, Sony Mavica MVC-CD250 and Sony Mavica MVC-CD400.  I'd estimate that I've taken 10,000 pictures with film cameras over the years (non-SLR, AE-1, A-1 and F-1, the A-1 and F-1 being bodies owned by my father, who is a well regarded semi-professional photographer and former instructor at the local Community College on film photography)and an additional 10,000 pictures with various digital cameras.This is my first Digital SLR purchase.General Impressions;My FIRST recommendation to anyone thinking of purchasing this camera would be to download the owners manual from Canon, it's available via the Canon Website in .pdf format.Several hours of your time spent reviewing the actual manual should provide confidence that this camera can be used effectively by any level of photographer.If you're a novice, disregard the \"Manual\" sections of the manual and concentrate your attention on the \"Automatic\" sections.  This camera is literally so easy to use a child can take an excellent photograph.  I let my 9 year old daughter (with me giving her 2 minutes of advice and observing her carefully to protect the camera as she used it) take 25 photographs in the \"Full Auto\" mode, using only the pop-up flash unit.  Out of 25 photos, I would rate 2 excellent on composition and the other 23 very poor (as expected), but the QUALITY of the images was outstanding.  Every image was crisp and vibrant.  My daughter is a TOTAL novice, other than using a few of the \"disposable\" pre-loaded cameras at a birthday party, these are the first 25 photos she's ever attempted.  The 2 of excellent composition (of her little sister who's 2, and was in full \"go\" mode moving around) I sent to my father (who hardly passes out compliments on my photographic skills at a whim)with his response being \"great photos\".I've personally shot 300 frames with the camera in \"Full Auto\" mode, using no flash (even when one was needed), the pop-up flash unit and the 420 EX (approximately 100 frames each way)and have even tried to \"fool\" the camera by taking portrait type shots in \"Sports\" mode and etc.  The camera is very intuitive and will save most users from common mistakes associated with trying to take Photographs as opposed to Snap Shots.  The only limitation on the quality of the images you can expect mostly relates to your skills in composing the photographs.This camera can be used as a point and shoot camera or can be fine tuned to allow more creative/experienced photographers to push their limits.  This is NOT a professional quality Digital SLR (or if it is, I can't imagine a pro using a digital camera, for high end photography this camera has SERIOUS limitations).  Having said that, I would recommend this camera to anyone that is comfortable spending the money on it.  This is not an inexpensive commitment.  Initial outlay for a \"basic\" set-up will run you between 1200 and 1400 dollars, and additional lenses, filters, accessories will add 500 or more dollars (with your budget being the only limit on the \"or more\" amount).I've read reviews where users mention several \"negative\" issues with the camera.  First, some reviewers mention that the battery cover \"rattles\".  I can't speak to their experiences, but there is no \"rattle\" on my camera body at all, none.  Very solid.  Second, I've read complaints that the size is too small.  I'm not a small man, and I have fairly large hands.  I think the camera IS compact, but not uncomfortable to use.  As a matter of fact, the smaller size keeps me mindfull of the fact that it's a precision instrument and that it takes a delicate touch on the shutter and a light \"approach\" to taking a great photo.  Finally, I've noticed that some people think the camera has a \"cheap\" feel to it.  I can only assume that they're used to camera bodies made of metal.  This body is plastic and rubber, but again mine feels very solid in my hands, not \"cheap\" at all, unless I heft my AE-1 right after the fact.  But that's comparing apples to oranges.Photo Quality:In the Large Fine Format, this camera will give you everything you expect in terms of image quality.Ease of Use:If my 9 year old can take pictures with it, anyone can.Value:Relative to the cost of other Digital SLR's (and having reviewed their owners manuals as well) I'd rate this as a very good value.5 Star Items:Autofocus - Very Fast, haven't \"stumped\" it yet.Menu - Easy to understand/useBattery Life - ExcellentImage Quality - ExcellentCanon Engineering - Excellent, I'm biased probably, never had a problem with a Canon Film SLR, don't expect any with a Canon Digital.Speed - Excellent, this camera is FAST.  Ready to go.Ergonomics - Very Very Good, but not perfect.4 Star Items:Viewfinder - It's very good, the placement of the screen leaves a LOT to be desired, but not enough to downgrade the camera overall.CF Slot - Not overly easy to get the card in, but not HARD.Pop-up Flash Unit - Good for what it is, but nothing you want to rely on if you're planning on taking good photographs in every situation.Included Software - Very good, nothing earthshaking.Battery Charging - Very good, under 90 minutes to take a drained battery back to full charge.Changing Lenses - Very good, about what you'd expect.Owners Manual - Informative, but could have been better organized.3 Star Items:Neck Strap - Poor, not comfortable.  Plan on buying a replacment.Included Lens - Average.  Meets the \"general\" purpose shooting requirements for most situations, about what you would expect from a $100.00 lens.  Plan on upgrading the lens, but I still recommend buying the full \"kit\" with Lens, instead of body only.Overall, I gave the camera a 4 star rating, because nothing is perfect, but personally I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this camera to anyone that isn't attempting TRUE professional quality photography.Recommended purchases;2nd Battery, 2nd CF Card (recommend Type II), Additional Lenses, Camera Bag, Remote Control, Filters, Flash Unit (420 EX, is cost effective and gives good results, EH-18L Body Case and Tripod.Potential worthy purchases;Battery Grip (BG-E3)AC Adapter Kit (ACK 700)Also, I bought my items directly from Amazon.com, got a good price and everything was delivered on time and in good condition.  Just to echo some other reviews, if they price is \"too good\" be wary, as always you get what you pay for.Hope this was helpful information.", "Date": "August 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Another stunning winner from the bright minds at Canon", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "RUOFFQX9BXLHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent three hours yesterday playing with the brand-new Canon Digital Rebel XT digital SLR camera, and man, was I impressed.I hadn't been too impressed with the original Digital Rebel, except for its revolutionarily low price (for a d-SLR), because it was slow and felt slimsy.  The new DR XT is quite different.  Even though it's 3 ounces lighter than the original DR -- mostly due to the use of a smaller battery; see below -- its smaller form factor actually makes it feel more solid and \"real\".  In other word, unlike the original DR, this one feels professional, not toy-like at all.By now you probably already know Canon makes some of the best digital cameras in the world.  Even though I'm a Nikon shooter when it comes to d-SLR (sorry, loyal Canon shooters!), I own a couple Canon compact digital cameras and love them, too.  The DR XT's image quality is once again excellent.  I took a few indoor shots with the camera, both with and without flash, and then the store clerk let me download them to their PC.  The JPEG pictures (I didn't try RAW) looked excellent on the Sony LCD screen, on par with the more expensive EOS 20D d-SLR.  Color tones were accurate and the resolution was really good.  The improvement picture quality over the original DR (\"DR Classic\"? BTW it's now $200 cheaper) comes from both the 2 extra megapixels and the better color accuracy.  BTW, the DR XT reportedly uses a tecchnically different CMOS sensor than the original DR, although I haven't been able to find out exactly how this one is better in technical terms than the old one (other than the two extra megapixels).  No matter, my limited true-world testing showed the image quality is indeed better than the already-excellent image quality of the original DR.  And, as in the past, Canon does a wonderful job at keeping noise low -- I considered noise acceptable up until ISO 800.The kit, which I recommend, comes with the same flimsy 3x EF-S lens (which won't work on regular film SLRs) as the original DR.  You should most definitely get a better lens, although the kit lens works well as a \"street zoom.\"  I didn't get a chance to test the lens outdoors as the store wouldn't let me take it outside, but I have no doubt that this new model can only be better than the original DR, which was already very good even before you considered its low price.The DR XT is fast: at last, you can turn it on and start shooting without waiting several seconds like you had to with the original DR.  The only downside compared to the original DR is the smaller, lighter battery in the DR XT also means shorter battery life.  I highly recommend you get an extra battery or two.  You won't be able to go through a full day of shooting on just one battery, even if you don't use flash much.  (But all pros and pro-wannabes use fill-in flash, don't we?)  I also recommend a good camera bag; I personally like Tamrac for that.  In addition to the spare battery (batteries), bag and a better lens or two, also consider getting a tripod (Sunpak ones are cheap but ok quality), an external flash as well as filters -- esp. a high-qual circular polarizing filter.In summary, the Canon Digital Rebel XT is another stunning winner from Canon.  It features faster speeds (start-up and shot-to-shot), excellent image quality, and terrific look-and-feel.  Despite my personal preference for Nikon pro-level gear, I can recommend this Canon d-SLR to my friends without reservation.Feel free to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail with your questions and commends.", "Date": "March 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "Handles Great, Autofocus just not there", "Author": "C. Moore \"The Authorguy\"", "ReviewID": "R2V2ILU2VF2BUH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, a couple of things.I wanted this camera to be great. I researched all the consumer dSLRs and decided on the XT Rebel 350 because of it's size and 8MP CCD, plus, I'd had two Canon point and shoot digitals that were fantastic.I've been taking pictures on a semi-professtional level for thirty years and I attended Brooks Institute of Photography, so I sort of know what I'm doing.Bought the Rebel XT at a local store in San Francisco, along with the Canon 28-200 Zoom. Immediately went up to Chinatown to shoot pictures of the Festival of the Harvest Moon with my wife, who was using her Nikon D70 with the Nikon 28-200.Shot pictures all day, and absolutely loved the way the XT handled. It was very intuitive, fast, had a bright viewfinder -- I couldn't have been happier.Then, we got home and looked at the pictures. I'd shot mostly on automatic, or shutter priority all day, with shutter speeds above 250th of a second.Bottom line, my wife's pictures were crystal clear, popped really, and mine of the same or similar subjects were just a tad fuzzy. You couldn't tell at 5x7 or so, but when you brought it up to 8x10  or above the difference was obvious. I checked the historgram on the shots, and they were made at nearly the same settings. Couldn't be, right? After all, the Nikon is only 6 MP, the Canon 8MP.So I put both cameras on a tripod, pointed them at a brick wall with a sign about 100 feet away, set everything the same on the cameras, and low and behold, same fuzziness.I took the Canon back the next day and traded it in on a D70. Now, maybe I got a bad lense, or a camera where the auto-focus was tweaked, but I couldn't afford the time to test it out again and again. I knew the Nikon would work, and it did (and does).Since then, I've talked to friends, professionals, who say that the XT is known to have auto-focus \"issues\".  This seems to be inconsistent, with some reviewers being delighted by the camera, others having a little problem.As I said above, the camera handles really well, intuitively, and  I actually like the compact size (some SLR users like a heavier camera). I may have gotten a lemon, but if you are going to need to depend on getting sharp pictures and can't go back for reshoots, I'd step up to the Canon D20 or go with a Nikon dSLR.", "Date": "January 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great dSLR especially for the money", "Author": "J. Chen \"weez\"", "ReviewID": "R13L07ANDQ7PZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this camera after considering between this and the 20D.  Was very impressed with the 20D, but the price difference could easily give me a very good lense, and the feature differences are minor, so Rebel XT it is.  I am a photography enthuiast who wishes he had the budget for a canon 1D MarkII but instead have the budget of a mortal and have to pay for a personal camera out of his own pocket.I have been reading some other reviews on this site and other sites regarding digital SLR cameras in general.  I had to admit, most of the reviewers really are better served with a point and shoot.  This is a SLR camera, it will take great pictures in automatic modes, but if you use your camera in those modes, get something like the Canon Pro1.  This camera is to be used in Av, Tv or Manual modes, maybe in Program in a pinch.  It requires you to understand WB, depth of fields, exposure metering as well as other wide array of nuances that come with a SLR camera.  If you don't want to spend some time to learn some details about photography, you will be better served with a point and shoot.  If you decide to use the attached flash for in door portrait shots, you're probably better served with a point and shoot.  If you need to frame your shot on the LCD, you're better served with a point and shoot (becasue the whole SLR concept of through the lense view of the scene, DOF checking, focus accuracy is completely lost by that opinion).  Yes the sensor on dSLR's will get dirty and require maintenance.  Some one mentioned why don't engineer design the sensor to have the opposite charge to rebel dust.  Well, dusts don't have one single polarity in their charges, so 50% of the dust will be attracted to the sensor doesn't matter what polarity the sensor is charged with.Also, this is not a Canon 1Ds either, so it does have its limitations, but then again, people who will feel completely limited by this camera should have gotten a Canon 1D series camera anyway.The best merit for this camera is foremost image quality.  It's extremely low in image noise all the way up to ISO 800.  ISO 1600 is completely usable if you stay below 8x10 enlargement and don't mind photoshopping your image a little.  Again, if you don't ever want to bother with photoshop adjustment of you pictures, you probably will be better served with a point and shoot.  The kit lense is of decent quality again for the price, but you're definitely short changing yourself if that's the only lense you decide for have for this camera.  If you want to buy the kit and had no intention to buy another lense, you shoud seriously be considering Canon Pro1, it's got a L glass and a good match between the lense and the body.  Buying this camera will be at most 50% of your investment if you truly want to make it worthwhile, the other 50% will be needed for buying good lenses (get the Canon 17-40mm USM L lense, the 70-200 4L zoom, and the 28-135mm as a walk-around, the Tamron 28-74 is an excellent medium range lense as well and is probably a superior substitue for the Canon 28-135 USM).I would have to say lack of spot metering does give the Nikon D70 an advantage, but this camera does have a center metering mode with exposure lock, so it is not really a show-stopper.  Compared to the D70, the Rebel XT has superior noise level performance.  This is from my personal experience as well as photos from a wide variety of sites on the net.  Low noise level is very important to me, so if this is on your priority list, you really can't go wrong with the Rebel XT at this price point.What I want to emphasize here is seriously consider your needs before buying this camera, to make this camera truly worth the money you spent, you need to spend a bit more of your money and a lot of more of your time on learning how to properly handle a piece of equipment like this.  Otherwise, you guessed it, Canon Pro1 is a very very good candidate.", "Date": "May 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "XT (EOS 350D) vs XTi (EOS 400D)", "Author": "NutMac \"NutMac\"", "ReviewID": "R3NSZST9IHPLWR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 1.5 years in the market, garnering a series of awards and praises, Digital Rebel XT (aka EOS 350D) has been replaced by Digital Rebel XTi (aka EOS 400D). For about one to two hundred dollars more, XTi offers some compelling benefits, such as:- New 3-point ultrasound dust removal system that cleans image sensor area; included software maps dust stuck in low pass area and electronically masks them.- 10.1 MP APS-C CMOS image sensor (3888 by 2592) vs. 8 MP (3456 by 2304) that improves resolution by 20% while maintaining dynamic range and noise level.- Faster image processing. In continuous shooting mode, it captures the same 3 frames per second but up to 27 JPEG or 10 RAW vs. 14 JPEG or 4 RAW.- Significantly improved 9-point TTL auto focus from EOS 30D vs. 7-point.- Brighter 2.5\" 230,000 pixel LCD vs. 1.8\" 115,000 pixel LCD.- Updated user interface.- Picture styles and RGB histogram.- More durable leathery paint finish.Of course, there are some losses, too. Most notably, XTi eschews dedicated LCD info display (integrated into main LCD now) and yields lower battery life (500 vs. 600 shots).All that worth extra dough? If all you want is to take great photos for less money, XT is still a great camera. I've used XT for almost a year now and it's capable of some amazing pictures, provided you use better than the crummy kit lens (although kit lens can be an affordable intro to the world of DSLR). If you can stretch your budget, XTi operates significantly faster with much nicer auto focus system.

The experience has been fantastic.  The pictures are nothing less than stunning.

It can be set to a full program mode, and used as a point and click snapshot camera by anyone at all, or put into full manual mode for the more experienced.I do have a couple of suggestions.  Order this body without the Canon lens.  I upgraded to a Sigma 28-300 mm Macro Zoom for about the cost of the original lens, and now have one lens for virtually any situation.Also, get top notch compact flash card.  I bought high speed, 1 GB Lexar 80x flash because I really wanted the ability to take high speed repetative pictures.  I was not disappointed.  You can either take one picture after another about as fast as you can hit the sutter, or put the camera into repeat-shot mode and hold the shutter button down.  This is a great feature.Also order a spare battery or two.

Buy the camera as a body only, spend 80ish dollars on the 50mm 1.8 prime lens, and another 20ish on the remote. You will still come out cheaper than if you buy the XT with a kit lens AND have an amazing, fast lens that gets raving reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. Check the lens reviews for yourself, especially if you're not familiar with prime vs. zoom lenses. The tiny remote is handy too!I'm betting you will eventually buy at least one more lens than what you start with to explore the capabilities of the XT.

Lacombe", "ReviewID": "R1IIGURIHASLRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the Rebel XT for over 6 months, taken literally 1000's of pictures and it's been great. Loved my old manual 35mm Nikon SLR, have been using digital point-n-clicks but wanted the control of an SLR again--no major complaints with the Rebel XT. Overall: if you're shopping for a solid DSLR, I'd definitely recommend it.Pros:+ Fast. I had a miserable time capturing action with my Canon S50 (a digital point-n-click)--response time made for hit-or-miss photos. The XT takes something like 3+ shots/second, a feature I've been happily using for action sequences I could never pull off before.+ Great depth of field. This was something I really missed from the old SLRs--you just don't get much depth with point-n-clicks even in those portait modes. The XT is great for isolating subjects in the shot.+ Battery lasts far longer than any other digital cameras I've had (I suspect b/c it lacks the preview window). As a bonus, the XT uses the same form factor as my Canon S50 so I only need one charger when I travel.+ Auto-focus is v. fast. I know I mentioned speed before but it's worth mentioning again. I hate waiting for other digital cameras to analyze a scene and take a shot--no delays with the XT.+ Starts up instantly. I didn't think I'd care about this but it's been great--you see a shot, you flick it on and before you can even raise the camera to your eye, it's ready to fire away.+ Software is better than I expected--it's actually usable as compared to some other software I've received with other cameras like Kodak.Cons:- The kit lens isn't terrible but isn't great. The manual focus ring is narrow and oddly positioned right at the tip of the lens; and you have to turn-off autofocus to use it (unlike most Canon lenses you can buy). It's also noisy. Aesthetics aside, the optics are ok and the range (from wide-angle to zoom) is hard to find in other Canon lenses (I've found that I've needed separate lenses to get the same wide-angle to zoom range).- One thing I didn't fully realize when I purchased was the impact of the 1.6 cropping factor of the EF-S lens form factor. The XT can take both EF-S and EF lenses. If you throw on an EF lens (the majority of Canon EOS lenses and what I've purchased for my zoom and primes), the scene is magnified by 1.6 (or you could say the edges are cropped). As I understand it, it allows for a smaller camera. The problem is that you really can't use an EF wide-angle lens since it loses it's wide-angle--you'll need to buy an EF-S wide-angle lens and there aren't many choices (I have the 10mm-22m). My concern is that I'm not sure whether Canon will support the EF-S form factor long-term and I hate investing in lenses only to have them obsolete in a year. Will see what happens. Something to consider since you'll probably be purchasing lenses to go with this camera.- Get ready to clean the camera more. I'm admittedly rough on my equipment (used the XT in the desert and the jungle). Problem is whereas point-n-clicks are sealed and the old 35mm SLRs would simply capture dust/dirt on single frame, getting a speck on the sensor on the XT (and probably most DSLRs) causes a blob on every shot you take until you notice it during reviews and clean it. I use a hand air pump--takes seconds but just be prepared.- One final note: be wary of suntan lotion and other lotions when using Canon cameras--I've managed to rub off the decals from two camera bodies so far--the ink or whatever is used to print the icons simply disolves.I consider these minor issues given the purpose of the camera is to help you take great shots and the Rebel XT definitely does this.", "Date": "July 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera overall--can't go wrong with it!", "Author": "Relentless \"skepticalbeliever\"", "ReviewID": "RATZSI3AF7Z16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi,I got this camera in the mail recently and all I can say is that I'm utterly impressed.

The plethora of Canon lenses you can attach to this camera is big enough to let your imagination do its work (limited only by the depth of your pockets).*Image quality is bar-none.*Noise @ relatively high ISOs (400-800) is negligible.*Battery life is decent (buy an additional battery).*The auto focus is blazing fast (with canon lenses).*Start-up time is unreal!*Menus and configuration settings of the camera are well thought-out and designed.*Very versatile; in fact, extremelly versatile. Just as it can work for those new to SLRs, it can work for advanced amateurs and semi-pro photographers as well.Things you need to (must) do and buy to make the most of this camera:* Ditch the kit lens...leave it as a \"just-in-case-of-doomsday\" lens.* Buy at least 2 more lenses one for wide-angle shots and one tele-foto (zoom). I recommend buying Canon's as they perform the best with their cameras (though if you're on a tight budget, you can get Sigma's).* Tripod.* External Flash (if you plan to use it in less-than-ideal light conditions).* Carrying case.* Filters.* Insurance!!!Yes, I know that buying all of the above will set you back $1700-2K (camera inclusive), but in this field is more true than anywhere else, \"you get what you pay for.\"If your hands are big and don't feel very comfortable with this camera, you might then try a D20 (or buy the external battery grip for the Rebebel XT).In short, very good camera, good price, good upgrade options, and reliable service from Canon. The best value in the DSLR market today--period!", "Date": "November 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Strong Camera with many improvements. Love it.", "Author": "Peter Jackson \"Not the LOTR guy\"", "ReviewID": "R2AIXPU2JUZBEK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about a week ago to replace my film-based Rebel G. My previous digital experience was with a 2MP Canon Powershot S100. I'm not a professional photographer, but I really like taking photographs (vs. snapshots). Canon has bundled a lot of goodies into a small, sturdy camera base that has proven iteself very capable to me.The contents of the package include a battery, the camera base, 3 CD with software and PDFs, a USB 2.0 connector, a video connector, a battery charger, a 18-55mm EF-S lens, a strap, and a manual. You'll need to provide your own CompactFlash card.  I personally selected a 1GB Ultra II card, which will shoot about 70 RAW+JPEG images, or 275 Large JPEGS.The battery arrives already charged, so I could immediately take pictures. Kudos. That is a favor that I appreciate. I shot a hundred pictures before getting home.The Digital Rebel XT has the familiar basic mode and creative mode control dial on the top. They have added an \"On/Off\" switch, which was not present on my film-based Rebel G. The consistency in the controls made it possible for me to shoot my first pictures right away, though there are some features to read the manual for: the TTL flash metering discussion, the nuances of choosing the AF mode, and how the basic mode operation decides which ISO speed to use were the topics I found myself most interested in this week.Pictures look really sharp and colorful up to the ISO 400 setting. ISO 800 and 1600 can be safely used if you are looking for a particular effect, are shooting where a flash and tripod are not permittted, or in other very low light situations. It's going to be pretty grainy, but with the included software tools, it can be compensated for to a limited extent.The on-camera flash is not great, but it is very good for a built-in flash. In a pinch, it'll work, but serious picture taking will require an external flash.The included software products have both PC and Mac versions, a boon to Mac users. My Canon snapshot camera only included PC software. Canon bundles a RAW image editor that is handy if you shoot RAW. iPhoto's RAW \"support\" isn't adequate for adjusting photos. Otherwise, the included software isn't much better than the iLife suite, unless heavy image manipulation is required. In that case, Photoshop is a better choice anyhow. PC users will get some use out of the photo editing software, though.TIP: If you are loading pictures onto a newer Mac with iPhoto, set the Communication Method on the camera to PTP/Print, NOT PC Connection. Otherwise, the Mac won't find the camera. That detail doesn't appear anywhere in the manual, though PTP/Print is the default (but not the intuitive) setting.The lens is OK. It's a decent value for $100, but I wish it would mount to a film camera in addition to a digital EF-S mount. Remember the focal length multiplier when you plan to share your lenses between film and digital cameras. A 50mm all-around lens on a film camera is a 80mm moderate telephoto lens on the Rebel XT.The strap is lousy. You'll want a different strap unless ithcy, sweaty, rubberized material is your idea of a comfy strap. I decided not to use it.To sum up, this camera really impressed me. The resolution is great, the images are as good as I could reasonably expect from my camera skills, and the total paackage operates well together. Areas where Canon could improve the package include: 1. Ship it with an EF lens, not an EF-S 2. Ship it with better quality accessories. That strap is terrible. 3. Include a CF card. 4. Ditch the unnecessary tools from the bundle of software. Every OS has photo management software built in. If that's not adequate for someone, they've probably already bought a package that they use.Otherwise, I loved it.Followup 25-March-2005:This is a followup comment to my review on the Rebel XT. The reason I've decided to follow up is that I've seen a lot of people equating the Digital Rebel XT to the Canon 20d because it has similar features and resolution. The conclusion, then, that the 20D is not worth the extra $599 is what has me concerned.Take note: the Canon EOS 20D has an expected shutter life of 150,000 photographs. The Canon Digital Rebel XT has an expected shutter life of 50,000 photographs. What does this mean to you? Well, if your shutter dies after 50,000 pictures, even within the warranty period, it counts as normal wear and tear, and you have to pay to have it fixed.If your 20D quits after 50,000 snaps, you get a new shutter free of charge. It turns out that the cost to have a shutter repaired on an XT is about half of the price difference. So figuring in expected depreciation of the camera based on shutter life, the two cameras are similarly priced.", "Date": "March 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "Digital focus processor needs some tuning....", "Author": "Outdoor cook", "ReviewID": "R2FCW11CGH4C5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The circle is now complete: I started with film SLRs about 35 years ago, used them professionally in my job, but for personal use, I had gone to point and shoot film and recently point and shoot digital.  I have not been happy with the sharpness of the point and shoot cameras so I thought it might be time to try the digital SLRs for sharpness and higher resolution.I ordered the silver body Rebel XT camera as I like it better than a faux pro black camera (this is afterall not a pro camera), and black cameras look dirty or dusty all the time. It came rapidly from Amazon.com.  I have had mostly good pictures with this camera, but there are a few things I would add to the other posters.Pro: compact, light, fast, good in outdoor daylight.Cons: in incandescent light the AWB is only fair. The picture color is better if you set this manually in a manual mode rather than using the AUTO mode.Sometimes the autofocus has a tough time figuring out where things are indoors, and sometimes there is severe hunting, with an occasional focus which is way off. You can fool this autofocus in situations where the subject is further back than foreground objects unless you set the focus point ahead of time, which is usually not what you think about on the spot.ISO speeds in AUTO mode is 400, and cannot be set higher.  You can set this to 1600 with very little noise in the non-auto modes.Kit lens is a bit soft in my example, despite good reviews.  I got in a Tamron lens (28-75) which seems sharper, but some say this lens has a yellowish cast, which I have not seen yet. One other thing pointed out by the professionals: you have to wait till the buffer has saved the picts to the CF card or they will be lost. So long as the little red led has stopped flashing you are OK.Overall I am happy with this camera.  I wish it were a bit more user friendly and intuitive, and there was more control over the ISO and AWB in auto modes.  You can't expect the kit lens to be very good considering the price it is, but I would rather have a better prime lense than a cheap zoom which you have to replace anyway.  Next time round I will just get a body and forget about the kit lens.  For those looking to step up from a point and shoot film camera or a lessor digital, this is the right direction.  I do wonder if I should have got the 20D instead, but for the difference in price, I got my Tamron lens and I am happy I did it this way.  Good luck and happy picture taking to you all...Edit 4/10/2005: before doing my 24-75 zoom Tamron lens rebate, I wanted to be absolutely sure there were no front focus issues with this lens in this camera. Some have said the Tamron lens might have a front focus issue, and I spent a lot of time yesterday and today specifically looking for front focus problems, and found none.  I took dozens of pictures indoors and out, with flash and without, and found no consistent problem worth sending the lens or camera back for.  As I said above the focus is sometimes off indoors, probably due to low light, but much more often than not it is good.  Outdoors today I shot some sharp pictures which focussed spot on, and I am pleased with the Tamron len's performance in my Rebel XT.", "Date": "April 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not perfect, but a great camera", "Author": "Mark Hornberger", "ReviewID": "R1EA9MKODRDTZ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd D-SLR, after the Pentax *ist D.  I switched because more lenses are made for Canon, the lenses are easier to find, and Canon also has USM focusing available.  I've had the camera for a little over a month, and don't regret buying it at all.  It IS small, and light.  The 20D looks better on paper and feels more solid, but it's also larger and heavier-about half a pound more than the Rebel XT.  After using the Rebel XT for a few days the size didn't seem like a disadvantage anymore.  It isn't weather-sealed, but neither is the 20D.Like others have noted, the LCD is hard to read in direct sunlight.  Here is where we see the advantage of having most information (ISO level, etc) in the small grey LCD--it's readable in all lighting conditions, whereas the color LCD washes out in bright sunlight.The camera also rattles a little, due to the hinges on the pop-up flash.  It doesn't sound broken or worrisome, but you are definitely aware that this isn't a professional-grade, durable camera.The XT doesn't feel as durable and substantial as the Pentax *ist D, or the Nikon D70, or some of the offerings from Minolta and Olympus.  But at the same time, it doesn't feel cheap to me.  Frequently the heft and density of cameras gives the illusion of quality.  The Rebel XT, though it feels superficially a little flimsy, is much more of a camera than any point-and-shoot superzoom made by Sony, Canon, or anyone else.  SLRs give you much faster focus, much better low-light performance, and the advantage of interchangeable lenses.That being said, you may be disappointed if you expect to get the Rebel XT and only the kit lens.  The kit lens isn't a good indoors or low-light lens.  If you absolutely don't want to spend any more money past the initial investment, stay away from SLRs.  You'll still get some advantages, granted, such as the faster focus, but overall it might be a disappointing experience for you.  I like the XT's kit lens, but it has its limitations.  There is no one do-it-all-well perfect lens.  If you shoot under good lighting conditions from f8-f11 you'll get good pictures with the kit lens and have nothing to worry about.  In a dimly lit room you'll need either a faster lens or something with image stabilization, like the Canon 17-85mm.Overall, this is a great camera, and the kit lens is a perfectly serviceable beginning lens, which is also small and light enough for travel.  I would prefer a more solid build, but I opted for the lighter weight and smaller size of the XT over the better build and durability of the 20D.  Both take about equivalent pictures, though there are some specs that are different, like more frames per second and ISO 3200 capability on the 20D.  Ultimately SLRS are more about lenses than the camera, and really all photography is more about the photographer than the equipment.  The XT, with the right lenses, is as capable as anything else on the market.  Unless you need ISO 3200, or 5 frames per second, or a heavier, sturdier build, I see little reason to opt for the 20D.

I did a little research on this material and found that it is virtually unbreakable and in laminated form is used to make \"bullet-resistant glass.\" Of course, no matter how tough the body is, something else will break, such as the lens or the internal workings, if the camera is dropped on a hard surface. That's why I always place the camera's strap around my neck before handling it.Although a couple of reviewers stated that the camera feels too light, I've found that it has plenty of heft with my 28-135mm lens.The Rebel XT is an excellent camera.

I've transitioned from using point and shoot cameras to the SLR.  I just can't believe the difference.  The quality of the photos is truly amazing.I was actually debating between the Nikon D70 and the XT.  I had been preferring the D70 b/c of the \"better\" kit lens.  But I actually went to Best Buy and took pictures with both cameras, side by side, at different settings including full auto.  I then printed out prints to compare the two.  The XT was ablt to pick up small shows and detail in the back of the store that the D70 just showed as a blur.  All different settings looked better with the XT.  The pictures were much, much clearer and crisper and the color was much more like actual colors in the store.  Also, the D70 wasn't as easy to use as the XT.  The menus were not as clear as the XT.  Needless to say, I stopped looking into the D70.Now, over 7500 photos later, I'm totally happy with my choice.  I have actually zoomed in on portraits using my desktop and was able to see the tear ducts in my daughter's eyes.  The camera is also simple enough for my wife to take great photos.Pros: 3 pics per second - super fast.  Great price for a dig SLR. Easy to use menus.  Great indoor photos.  Battery charges in less than 2 hrs and lasts forever.  Many great Canon lenses to choose from.  Manual and auto focus lens is great.  Great clarity photos.  8 megapixal is awesome.

Using PhotoShop CS2, I can take the RAW files and turn them into 70 meg files with amazing quality and clarity.I recommend the external power grip as it adds a vertical grip and also the ability to use AA batteries or 2 lithiums! Consider also adding the 420EX flash if you plan to do a lot of flash photography. The 420EX will allow you to save the camera's battery and also give you a  more powerful flash that syncs at ALL shutterspeeds in Program, TV and AV modes.

I first bought the Canon Powershot S2. I thought that was a decent camera, but after using it for a couple of days, it was obvious that in 6 months I would want more horsepower.So I returned it and bought the Digital Rebel XT (otherwise known as the 350D). It was definitely the right decision.I won't go into many technical details as so many people already have, but instead would like to inform anybody on the fence between point and shoots and SLRs to definitely go with the SLR. The 350D is worth every penny. It is a joy to be able to grab the camera, flick it on (0.2 second startup) and shoot. At 3 frames per second with a good memory buffer, you will be all set to capture your shots at a moment's notice. That is something that point and shoots simply cannot do. I don't know about you, but I value the ability to flip on my camera and instantly get a shot.The 350D was the highest rated digital SLR in the recent Consumer Reports magazine too. Everybody I know who has one loves it.From the camera startup, to shooting, to uploading the images on my PC, the 350D performs excellently. The menu system is well designed, the buttons are accessible. The more I use the camera, the more I like it.This is a much lighter camera than Canon's next in line 20D. The 20D is made of metal and is about $500 more. The 350D has a plastic body (but it's quality, sturdy and has a very solid feel). Best of all, the camera is LIGHT. You can barely feel it hanging on your shoulder.The 350D kit (as opposed to just the body) comes with an 18-55 lens. This is an economical lens, about $100 retail, but I think it's very good quality for its price.The 350D, as well as the 20D, can use all of Canon's \"EF\" series lenses (the world's largest assortment of interchangeable lenses). This means that if you want to invest in lenses, you can do so with confidence because when it's time to upgrade the camera body, all of your lenses will fit.So, yeah, this camera is fantastic. It's light, versatile and powerful. Because of this, barriers to usage are minimal. What I mean is that if you want to go somewhere, it is easier than ever before to bring your camera along.

The build quality, features, and photo quality have made this camera a joy to own and use.When I first decided to move from film to digital, I began the long and tedious process of researching all the cameras on the market at the time. I had previously owned many Canon film cameras and compact digital cameras, so they were of course my first choice. I looked at Nikon, Olympus, Canon, and Konica(now Sony) dSLR's.The Canon came out on top in all catergories with the exception of a few at the time, such as price because of the Nikon D50, though the Rebel's other features clearly outway the Nikon. Overall, the Canon is just a superior camera, so hopefully, that saves you the trouble of spending nearly a month researching.Alright, so how is that camera? It is wonderful. It fits well in my hands and everything is where it should be. It does feel a little light, but it is made to be compact and light, plus that can easily be remidied by adding a battery grip. All of it's settings and features are virtually identical to the more expensive 20D, as is the image quality. There is a good amount of grain at ISO 1600, which is really a shame, but that can generally be fixed in an image editing program or by using a flash. The battery life is very good, but I do reccomend purchasing that battery grip that I mentioned before. Not only does it add weight and balance the camera, but it also doubles the battery life, which is good for those of us who go out and take thousands of pictures.This is just a wonderful camera for the prosumer crowd, and there is no reason that it cannot be used as a pro camera for creating prints and such. I would recomend this to anyone looking to break into photography or someone who has been photographing for 30 years.My recomendations:- Get a few extra batteries and a battery grip. Remember, you don't have to buy a Canon grip or batteries, and if you don't, you'll probably save at least 50%. Do some research on here. The Opteka grip is great, it is what I own, and you can find a huge number of batteries, just pick own with a good review.- Sigma lenses are generally in expensive, take great shots, and are durable. Some Canon lenses will have better optics, but will cost at least twice as much.- Get the Canon 50mm f/1.8. It is a very inexpensive lens(about $60 - $70) and takes amazing shots.- Big memory cards are amazing. Buy one, seriously. I have a 6GB card and shoot in RAW, so I get about 650 pictures. JPG will get 2000. I need another one because I shoot so much.- External hard drives are a must for all those big files. I have a 250GB Phantom Drive, and I reccomend that, but there are now many cheaper alternatives.- Don't forget a tripod and/or a monopod, a flash(though it does have one, external flashes are much better), and filters if you want to experiment.Hope you enjoy your camera as much as I have!", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Can't get any better than this..", "Author": "Floyd Goodrich \"Jim G.\"", "ReviewID": "R3F8J5FGUWF5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera.

I have since not looked back.  This camera has brought nothing but joy to myself and others.  The sharpness and colors from the famed Canon sensor are true to their reputation.  Friends and family all love the pictures that come out of this camera.After selling my Rebel, I debated upgrading to the new Rebel XT or the 20D, which I'm sure many of you might be having right now before pulling the trigger.  I held both in my hand and played with them at the PMA tradeshow where the XT was introduced.  It was very light and felt very small in my hands.  I don't have exceptionally large hands, but the XT felt like it was designed for smaller hands.  That being said, it is a great travel partner to have being so compact and light-weight.The only other drawback, however, is that the user interface is quite different from the 20D.  Although it may seem like a trivial feature, the dial navigation on the 20D has been immensely more convenient and practical when shooting compared to pressing the buttons on the Rebel or the XT.  I didn't like having to navigate through the ISO or other changes to white balance via the LCD screen.  I definitely think there's a reason why the 20D is more expensive beyond the fact that it has the solid magnesium alloy body.  The user interface for me was worth the extra money as well.  The more you take photos, the more you will realize the freedom that comes with controlling your aperture, shutter speed, white balance and more with the 20D interface versus the XT.  That being said, it is still several hundred dollars more expensive and the sensors are practically the same (the XT has 0.2 fewer megapixels).  But the XT will give you the same stunning results because the differences are mainly external.The XT is not for everyone just as the 20D is not for everyone.  I suggest strongly considering and weighing the differences between the two camera bodies before purchasing and prioritizing what's most important to you between size, weight, and UI.  If you travel a lot and don't want to lug around a heavy camera...then without a doubt get the XT.  It's the same bang for less buck and for the price the XT package can't be beat.I highly recommend getting the kit lens with either camera.  For an additional 100 or so bucks it is well worth it just for the range and it has pretty decent quality results.  Bang for your buck it can't be beat.  Make sure you pick up a EF 50mm f/1.8 II USM lens for another 80 bucks.

As stated, function, expandability, and speed of an SLR built into a digital Camera.2. The camera is built to last for quite some time - it's durable in its construction and the 8MP capability will produce super prints for years to come.3. The battery: The life has been phenomenal so far - I don't think that I've seen the meter drop below \"full,\" while taking photographs, and that's at taking over 400 photos at a time (not all at once though, of course). Plus, it's rechargeable - Kudos to Canon for their forward thinking4. Speed, Speed, Speed. The camera acts just like a 35mm which means that it has a pretty fast processor.5. Cost - a very economical choice considering what you have in this camera.The Cons:1. Expect it to be heavy, because it is.2. There's no built in memory. So buy a compact flash card when you buy this camera as you will need it.3. Related to the above: A good compact flash card is not necessarily \"cheap.\"Altogether, this camera is worth it.

It is also one of the easiest to use.  With a simple turn of the dial, you can put it in point-and-shoot mode, specialized automatic modes for various situations, or any of the \"artistic\" modes, including fully manual.You'll want to shoot using the higher-end modes, because you can save your pictures in RAW format, allowing you to fix errors afterwards that cannot be corrected in a jpg.If you can afford it, get this camera body only, and skip the kit lens.  Instead, fork over the $600 for the 17-85mm IS lens by Canon.  The Image Stabilization is well worth it, and the lens is versatile enough that you don't have to change lenses at all for most shooting.  Although I've not had any problems with dust, this is supposedly a weak spot for digital cameras, and not having to change lenses is a major plus.  (In fact, the only other lens I use on this camera right now is a 600-1300mm zoom.)  The camera's computer will automatically balance the lens IS feature in both automatic and \"artistic\" shooting.I also got the Canon speedlight 580 with this camera, and the camera's computer also accurately balances with the flash, syncing at up to 1/200th, I think.  Outstanding.The only thing I wish this camera had that it doesn't was 1/8000th of a second.  There have been some bright daylight shots in which I didn't have time to get the shot in, because 1/4000th wasn't enough, and the shot was gone before I could adjust everything to it.  Shooting in RAW, however, I was able to correct most of it afterwards.I did lose some pictures by snapping the shot right before turning the camera off.  If you do that, you will lose the shot.  (It only takes about a second to save a shot, so you just have to not turn it off instantly after the shot.)All in all, I could not be happier with this camera.  I've used it to shoot baseball and softball, both portraits and action, including action close-ups with a long zoom and both a tripod and monopod, several thousand wildlife shots, mostly with a long lens, several hundred outdoor scenery shots, and several thousand candids.

Time to replace the Sony and move up a notch!  Having been well-impressed with the Rebel 6.3 and the two lenses we'd added (EF 55-200 4.5-5.6 USM and the superb EF 700-200 2.8 with Canon's 2X extender bought used), we decided to jump on the Digital Rebel XT with the 18-55 lens.It arrived Thursday, and we sent it back Monday.  Here's why.  It was too small.  Smaller is usually better, but the XT started to feel and look like a toy camera, or at least a point-and-shoot.  My wife and I both have smallish hands, and the XT was bordering on being too small to be ergonomic for us.  With the 70-200 lens attached, the Rebel XT disappeared.The second why is features.  This is not a knock on the XT, which is a fine (excellent, really) camera with significant improvements over the original Digital Rebel.  When we sent the XT back, we got Canon's 20D.  Aha! you say.  The XT and the 20D are basically the same camera.  Not completely, and here's Canon's language comparing the two:\"There are, of course, some very real differences between the EOS Digital Rebel XT digital camera and the more advanced EOS 20D. While the 20D SLR includes performance features such as faster continuous shooting speed (5 frames per second [fps] vs. 3 fps) with larger burst capability (23 frames vs. 14 frames) and custom function settings (18 vs. 9) that more than justify its heftier price tag, this new Rebel XT model was created for those dedicated SLR users who are migrating to digital for the first time and don't wish to give up the flexibility an SLR system offers.\"After using the Digital Rebel and three lenses (plus extender) we evolved from point-and-shoot to serious amateurs, and now we're knocking on the door of \"prosumer.\"  The 20D puts us there.  It also uses the same batteries as the Digital Rebel, which is a plus.  Like the Digital Rebel, the 20D is the size of a traditional SLR and easier to handle than the XT, even if it weighs a bit more.This is not a rip on the XT, but a word to the wise for folks like us who feel ready to move to the next level.  We took some fine photos with the XT, which we aren't discarding just because we sent back the XT.A final note:  If you get the XT (and that is not a bad thing), get the body only and a lens other than the 18-55 that comes standard in the Digital Rebel and XT kits.  Again, this is a fine lens with good, middle-of-the-road capability.  But if you're getting serious, you need all the lens you can afford, or even a little more than you can afford.  The Canon EF-S 17-85 4.5-5.6 gives a lot of range and versatility and would be great with an XT if you're trying for really good photos while keeping life simple and your camera-lens package light.  Even better is the EF-S 10-22 3.5-4.5.  But the prize of our collection is the EF 24-70 2.8.  It provides superb performance.  Yes, the cheapest of those is about the price of an XT body.  You get what you pay for.  We were lucky enough to have fallen into a little cash and put it into a 20D and a great lens (24-70), a really good lens (10-22), and a relatively compact versatile lens that performs well in good light (17-85).If you're sitting on the fence as to your photographic future, I hope this helps.", "Date": "July 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "Amazing quality and versatility", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R1P7LR8XZ17QJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an amazing camera!

I've used a T90 since they were introduced in 1986, added a Hasselblad in 1999 for landscapes and a Sony point and shoot in 2002 for \"walking around\".I found I was using the Sony for all our holiday and travel shots, and the Hasselblad just for my recreational landscapes, the T90 not at all. I began to want the creative control I had with 35mm but with the convenience of digital, and decided that a DSLR was the answer.Here's how I use my Rebel XT:With a 24mm EOS as the ultimate \"carry around\" camera, it's very compact and light, has outstanding battery life and gets plenty of shots on a 1Gig card. Perfect for \"point and click\" type shooting.Switch to the outstanding 17-40 f4L and add the battery grip for more \"serious\" out and about shooting. This is my typical vacation configuration. The battery grip provides a very comfortable holding position, and I can probably manage over 1,000 shots without recharging when using two batteries. The 17-40 f4L is a beautiful lens with outstanding color rendition and resolving power, it also has very good environmental seals that keep moisture out of the lens and the body. I've had the surface of an umbrella in Scotland dumped on the camera in this configuration and it survived fine.For motorsports photography I use the 70-200 f4L and a monopod. I've had prints made at 24\"x36\" from these sessions that are simply stunning.For closeups I use a set of fully automatic tubes and a 50mm 1.8, a great lens for very little money.Observations:Be prepared to do more work in post-processing than with a point and shoot, the Rebel XT does not pump up the colors or sharpening as much in camera as the strictly \"consumer\" cameras - but used properly the results can be much better.Control focus points yourself. I think many focus problems stem either from not noticing that the camera has picked the wrong point for you, or not paying attention to the aperture picked if using one of the more \"programmed\" modes. I use Speed priority or Aperture priority only, just as I always did with the T90. I tend to configure auto focus so that only the centre sensor is used and use focus hold to pick the spot and then re-frame.

This camera is the closest to film you will get for the price and with all the advantages digital has to offer (technically speaking, a DSLR would have to be 12 megapixels to exactly match 35mm film quality).  My only reservation is it's small size but that is a very minor complaint. A friend of mine has a Canon 20D and it is a better camera, but only slightly and costs $500.00 more.  Save your money or spend it on a better lens, I bought the Canon EFS 17-85mm and it performs beautifully.  By the way, don't believe all the critics that say megapixels aren't important and 6 megapixels are enough - that is not true. Even though most people are not printing large 8X10 or larger prints, many photos are indeed cropped and the more megapixel per photo there is the sharper the photo will remain.

If you've done any research you've probably come to realize that the 18-55mm kit lens is a dud.  it produces poor color saturation, it's slow as Christmas, and is not very sharp.  You can improve the color saturation a little with  a polarizing filter, but you're better off just not buying the lens.  For (...) you can get a great little 50mm fixed lens that is pretty sharp from about f1.8 - f8 and it has great color saturation.It's also true that you have to compose the shot through the view finder and not on the LCD.  You're playing with the big boys now!  There's more to think about than whether to use the \"little mountain\" or the \"little stick man.\"  Shutter Speed, aperture, ISO Sensitivity, White balance, Light meter, and the ability to lock the focus are all viewed through the view finder.Here's the rub with the XT... It's Tiny, It's plastic, and any thing shot with an ISO of 800 and above is pretty worthless.  It's not a pretty grain!If I had to do it over again I would have gotten the 30D for several reasons.

Simply put, it is fantastic. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the quality of pictures taken with this camera equals that of the MUCH more expensive 20D. Image quality is also superior to the Nikon D70, both in terms of noise level and resolution (8MP vs 6.1MP). So while this camera may not have the metal body, substantial feel, and features of the above two cameras, it either equals or exceeds these two cameras in terms of image quality. And is image quality not perhaps the most important quality of a camera? I should also note that the Rebel XT is cheaper than EITHER of these cameras.Of course, this camera is not without some hitches. One is, of course, the lens. Many others have complained about this. Admittedly, it is not too bad in many situations. And perhaps I have not found all of its faults. But it has one SEVERE shortcoming I have painfully noticed - no numbers on the focusing ring. This is quite a problem if you like night photography. In such a situation, it is VERY hard to focus using the viewfinder. And an estimation of distance generally results in a better focus. Numbers would also make landscapes easier to focus on, as you often just go to infinity.Speaking of night photography, another annoyance I have found is a few errant bright pixels in dark areas. This is a particular problem with high ISO and/or long exposure times. And the noise reduction does little to nothing to deal with this. However, I do not know that another digital camera would do better in this area. These sorts of artifacts could very well represent a shortcoming of digital technology (vs film) which has not yet been overcome.Another issue is size. This camera is quite small. But this can be a good or bad thing. On one hand, it can make the camera more difficult to hold. But on the other hand, it makes it light and easy to carry with you. I guess it all boils down to what you are comfortable with.The bottom line: despite any shortcomings, a GREAT choice for your first digital SLR. It's inexpensive.

It is not as popular as CCD but the future promises us even better digicams based on CMOS sensors due to the lower amount of power consumption versus the typical CCD device) sensor very similar to that on the Canon EOS 10D, as well as most of the same exposure features.The main differences lie in the design of the body. The Canon EOS \"Digital Rebel\" XT makes much greater use of plastic, it has less control over focus or metering modes, also does not have a Custom settings menu, and a handful of other minor changes. The Canon EOS \"Digital Rebel\" XT is an exceptionally small and lightweight camera designed for amateur Digital SLR owners, but it delivers the responsiveness and image quality you'd expect from a semipro model.What's new is a specially designed Canon EF-S lens, designed only for the Digital Rebel, and sold only as part of the Digital Rebel kit. This new lens takes advantage of the size difference between the Rebel's sensor and a normal 35mm film frame to reduce the back-focus distance, shrink the image circle, and shed quite a bit of size, weight, and cost in the process. The biggest draw for the Digital XT is that it offers much of the same functionality as the wildly popular 10D model, but at a much lower price.After personally owning the Canon EOS \"Digital Rebel\" XT for four months, I have found it more useful than a normal pocket digital camera and normal SLR (Single Lens Reflex) camera.

All the positive things that have been said are true so I'll spend my time with some ideas for those who are on the \"fence\" or who are not sure if a DSLR is for them.If you are new to DSLRs and/or photography, this camera (and any dslr) takes more knowledge than a standard p&s; camera.  The biggest complaint I hear is it is not as sharp as my old P&S; and the pictures are softer.  DSLRs do not apply as much in camera sharpening so your images may not be as sharp straight from the camera (you can change that in the camera).Best results will always come if you do some post image processing (pp).  If you do not like PP, this is a negative, however, you can set the in-camera options to apply pp to your liking.  It is just better controlled in pp software.Knowledge of photographic concepts such as Depth of Field(dof) and exposure control are needed.  People sometimes complain about the cameras soft images when in actuality it is user error due to the concept mistakes above.Plan to spend more money on lenses!!!  The 18-55 is very good for the money ($80-$100 market) but is nowhere near the quality of other options that you have.  Plan to spend more on at least 1-2 quality lenses for best results.  There is really, really a noticeable difference.A few reasons I rated this camera 4 instead of 5:  1)The eyepiece view is a little smaller than other DSLRs.  This makes composing a little more challenging, espec. for manual focus. 2) the viewfinder is too dim and gets washed out in the sun.In the end, image quality is king and the images from the 350D arethe kings crown.", "Date": "June 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Rebel XT", "Author": "Brian W.

Then a couple of years ago I bought a Nikon point and shoot.  But I still preferred my film slr, except for that fact that I had to buy film, take the pictures, then wait for the results.  I used the point and shoot more and more, for the instant results.  But my wife and I got frustrated with the lag time, and the fact that most of the pictures with the point and shoot had to be posed.  When I used my old Minolta (x700) and Nikon(N6006) slrs, all the pictures were spontaneous and captured the moments as they occurred. We were never able to do that with the Point and Shoot.  So we decided to bite the bullet and buy into the DSLR world.  I looked and compared for months on the best camera.  \"What brand should I buy?, How many MP? What price range??????What sold me on the Canon was the cost and the quality of pictures it takes.  I could have bought a more expensive camera, but then that would have left me with little money to add on.  I took one piece of advice from the message boards and that was to not worry about the camera body, invest your money in glass.  And coming from the film slr world that makes perfect sense.  So we bought the Rebel XT.I have had it for two days and can only say how great it is.  I love being able to compose pictures like I use to do with my film slrs, but being able to see the results instantly.  I love being able to make adjustments and reshoot it instantly, not a week later when I got the film back.  Yesterday I fired off 150 shots, which I never would have done with the film SLR, because of cost, and I probably would be waiting for the shutter on my point and shoot.I know the Rebel isn't the perfect camera.  I wish I had a bigger LCD and the grip was a little more comfortable, but that is superficial.  It is what is on the inside that counts.

Here's the list of problems I found based on my use:1. The sensor gets dirty easily (I do switch lenses often, never in any dusty environment though), and hard to clean.2. Shutter button becomes sticky just now, won't release once pressed sometimes.3. View finder is small and hard to manual focus in regular day light, impossible in dim in door setting for me.4. The menu has most of the things I need, but not quick to get to during shooting. I have to give up so many good opportunities just to adjust the settings: focus (single point to muli-point), white balance. Yes, the custom white balance works great. But I didn't realize I have to rely on it in most of the in door settings. Auto WB fails in door most of the time with strong color bias without flash. When different rooms have different lighting condition, I have to set each one up before I can make my shots. And it ain't easy or quick. This is the pain in the ... Tried Olympus Evolt E500 and the auto white balance on it was worse. Maybe this is an inheritant DSLR problem because of the current limitation of the sensor technology?5. The building flash is kinda weak, but the recycle is fast. The external flash just is too big and slow. Wish Canon will make the new ones more powerful in the future.6. The camera's software gives me errors from time to time, regardless which lenses I use, Canon or Sigma. Pull the battery and restart usually solves the problem. But at one time, it went totally crazy, none of the lenses I have can auto focus. I ended up reinstall the firmware and it solved the problem.I am going to send it back for service, and hope things will get better after that.All in all, this really is an entry level DSLR, something supposed to be a lot more expensive. Canon managed to make it affordable for us mortals with a catch. I think I'll move to the 30D line when it comes out with auto sensor cleaning. The full frame is great (better view finder and faster AF, among other things), but it places too much pressure on the lenses. I just can't afford the right lenses for the full frame. Haven't heard any rumors on 40D yet. The new 400D XTi supposes to have better AF and sensor cleaning. But I am far more cautious about the Rebel line in general now. Perhaps Canon made too many comprimises to make this line affordable.By the way, I took over 80,000 pictures with this camera in less than a year. So I real used it.--------------------------------Update Sept 2008Finally updated to 40D, right before 50D was announced, thanks alot Canon :) AF is so much better on the 40D! But everything else is still the same, except there are more buttons so I can have better control more easily, most of the time. AWB still sucks, so I shoot RAW these days. Just take much much more time for the home work afterwards. But I wouldn't blame 350D for its limitations. Because no matter which way you cut it, it's in a different world from any point and shoot, even with the humble kit lens. For those who want to have something to shoot their small kids, go get an entry level DSLR like this one, or maybe a Nikon if you haven't already got so many EF/EFS lenses like myself. With those point and shoot, you have missed way more great shots than you realized. I only got mine when my slow little Olympus died on me. Then I discovered DSLR.

So as a first time-camera owner, I'm more than thrilled.First the bad (and they aren't that bad):1.  As you start using it more you want to buy more accessories, like filters, lenses, and tripods, oh, and a bigger bag every few months for all the growing stuff.  Okay, not really a negative, but something you should watch for.2.  The 'Kit' lens that comes with the camera is great for most shots within 50 feet or broad landscape shots.  For people new to SLR's (digital or not) the kit lens is a good starter lens to feel out SLR's potential, but if you have even a few months of SLR experience, I would suggest buying the body-only and selecting the lenses you know you'll want.  Because anything more than 50 feet or if you're trying to capture a specific element of a landscape shot, you'll find the kit lens lacking.3.  Manual settings are a little difficult to figure out.  Okay, when I bought this camera I knew nothing of f-stops or shutter speed and any combination of these.  I am still closer to confused than comprehending, but I've found I want to start trying out these seetings and it isn't obvious how to set these yourself.  For those who want to just take a picture the cheat-sheet at the top (a wheel you turn to tell the camera what type of combination of f-stops/shutter speed/etc you want) is more than adequate (and I've had no problems using it).  But after starting to learn what you can do by modifying f-stops and shutter speeds, I have started to yearn for a more newbie friendly process.  Again, though, this is really dependent on the type of person you are.  I like lots of control so this has started to gnaw at me some (though no where near enough to rate less than 5 stars)The good (and I think they're real good):1.  I've never had any of the pictures developed (I bought a digital camera for a reason), but image wise, the pictures are great quality.  As I take pictures with the highest resolution the camera allows I find I'm often disappointed by a picture until I remember that the picture is 3x larger than what my monitor displays, and when I view full size the detail is incredible.  I had a chance to shoot some tidepools, and I'm not sure the urchins and starfish looked that good in person.2.  Lots of high-quality pictures.  I bought 2, 2GB memory cards and I can fit 566 highest quality JPEG pictures on them.  With two cards I've never had to worry about being selective with my shots.  Professionals might find this untrue, but as a budding hobbyist, I'm extremely happy.3.  Battery life, I read somewhere that you should have 2-3 times as many batteries as you think you'll need. Well I'm a little curious about that one.  I have 1 battery and I've never been concerned about losing a charge.  I've virtually filled both of my 2GB cards up on the same battery (800+ pictures) and it still showed a nearly full charge.  Now I may be less demanding than most because:a)  I don't review pictures, I do that when I return homeb)  I don't take many pictures with the camera's flashBut even when I've forgotten and left the camera on for a few days after taking a few hundred shots, it still shows a nearly full battery.  Now you probably should have a few extras just in case, but if you aren't away for extended periods, battery concerns are quite minimal.4.  Ease of use - The Canon is VERY forgiving.  Even right of the box, if you leave the settings on automatic and let the camera decide the settings you'll be very happy with the shots.  Knowing how to adjust the settings will give you an incredible shot, but for the rest of us, we can let the Canon select the settings and come out with a very good shot that more than meets our hopes.*****Summary:  This 8MP is a greaty starter camera and looks to be able to scale upward.  It is very forgiving of your ignorance, allows you ample ways to upgrade as your understanding grows, and is a joy to use.Even if you plan on becoming a pro, this is a great camera to cut your teeth on without breaking the bank.  I'd recommend this camera to any beginner or non-professional.", "Date": "November 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera", "Author": "Altervarks", "ReviewID": "R3D43ZCTFJX103", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good \"business\" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.

As my first DSLR, I was slightly intimidated by learning all the manual features, but the XT is very easy to learn, and I find myself never ever using the auto modes. My pictures almost always turn out perfect, and if they don't it's my fault due to still learning. I was also a little worried about the reviews that say so much has to be done in photo editing, but I don't find this to be the case. I spend only minutes on some pictures, and others I don't have to change anything, save for erasing some dust spots.My only complaints are these; The view finder is very small... Being near-sighted, it makes it a very slow process for me at times to do manual focus, though I do it anyway. However after a day of shooting I find my eyes hurting from the strain. This is where the 20D or 30D win. I played with a 20D at the camera shop, and was so happy that it only took me a split second to do manual focus with it.And then there is the small LCD screen. I thought I lived with it on my point and shoot, I can live with it here, however I can't. It makes it very hard to make sure your shot turned out as sharp as you were going for with such a small LCD, or it may just be my eyes. This is where the 30D wins. (if you can't tell, I just ordered a 30D, though I will still use my XT as often as I use my 30D)Here is a tip that many have handed out. Skip the Kit lens. I bought it thinking \"Well, they might not use it, but I will\" .. I used it maybe once at the most. Save your money there, and put it towards better glass.

They are finally replacing my 20d with the new 30d - but that's another story.  As an aside, I don't believe the problem was with the 20d as much as it was the company that Best Buy contracted with to do the repairs.Anyways, on to the review.  I gave a rating of 4 stars because it is a good camera in its own right. But after owning a 20d for almost two years, I was much, much happier with the 20d than with the Rebel XT.But don't get me wrong, the XT is still a very good camera for the money.  The picture quality is superb, with crystal clear pictures.  I did notice a difference in color rendering with the XT, but a lot of that could have been my lack of experience with the XT as the the controls are somewhat different than on the 20d.Another major difference between the two cameras is size.  If you have large hands, you will definitely appreciate the larger 20d.  The XT is much smaller and feels more like a toy in my hands.  Its plastic body (as opposed to the magnesium alloy body of the 20d and 30d) made me a little nervous as well.  Although I've never dropped my camera (knock on wood), I think the added ruggedness of the magnesium body adds a bit of insurance to your investment.One other major difference is the focusing.  I noticed that the XT doesn't auto focus nearly as well as the 20d.  It tended to focus on the wrong point more often than I would have liked.All in all, the XT is a very good camera and is a smart purchase if your budget pushes the 20d or 30d out of reach.

The camera is so good that it is forcing me to buy a new photo printer to do it justice. I bought the standard \"kit\" lens with the 18-55mm zoom. It is a good lens for the price. I just wish it were just a little faster than f3.5-5.6.

It is sold as a non-professional grade DSLR but I have sold pictures taken with it professionally, as I'm sure countless others have as well. I don't think I need to be the 999th person to wax poetic about it, so I won't go any further. There are plenty of other well-written reviews detailing the good points in better ways than I can.I did want to write this review, however, as a cautionary tale against buying this crappy kit lens. Please just buy the body only and get a decent lens separately! I sure wish I had.Again, I am talking only about the kit lens here: horrible in low-light, horrible in too much light. Here's the biggest issue, however: porous construction allows dust inside. I kid you not, day one of owning it after cleaning it with a lint free cloth, there were about 20-30 little dust particles visible ON THE INSIDE! No way to get them out, either. I tried blowing on it with a compressed air can (just to hopefully move them to the sides and out of the middle) but all it did was move them around. How is this lens so porous right out of the box? If the dust was already there out of the box and I just didn't notice it, that would be just as bad if you ask me. Of course there is no way to open it without sending it off, which would cost more than the lens is worth. I will say the dust was so tiny that I never saw any interference in the picture output, but just knowing it is there is enough to drive a perfectionist like me CRAZY. Sidebar: I don't imagine many people who are purchasing DSLR cameras for several hundred dollars are not perfectionists, but I digress.Anyway, again great camera just don't get this worthless kit lens. Spend a couple of hundred extra and get a decent USM lens. If there one more issue to mention, it would be that the built-in flash is laughable. I don't know why they even bother putting it there. It should be used in case of emergency only! If you are planning on shooting indoors you must get a flash. Not you should get a flash, you must.

Carpenter", "ReviewID": "R2YZC8RZACOCVW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first DSLR and a very good choice at that.It has numerous features,alot like the higher class Canon cameras.Like alot of reviews I write I often start with the bad,because when I was researching this camera and others,thats what I wanted to hear first.So thats where Ill start with this one.Cons:Even though I wouldnt say I have huge hands it still felt small in them.If you happen to have smaller hands,male of female,then this wouldnt be a problem.Its more of a preference than it is a knock against the quality of it.I just feel it should still be mentioned.And with that said,you will often find little white fingernail scuff marks on the inside right part of the lens housing,next to the grip.I have heard others complain about the size and awkwardness of the grip and in my opinion that was very trivial.If youre looking for complaints about body and design,much can be said about every camera out there,so to me,I was more interested in the performance.But if you do worry about the design of it,then I will add that it is made of a type of plastic,rather than a alloy like the other higher end Canon cameras are,which again to me,trivial but can be noticed when compared.Back to performance,it is a tad slow on the focusing.Another obstacle I noticed was when taking spontanious pictures often it would go into the self timer due to me accidently pressing one of the buttons and changing the setting.Im not sure I credit that to the size of the body or the simplistic way of altering a feature.Then there is the sensor size.Some will say full frame is better,others swear by cropped sensors.It really all depends on what you want to shoot.Cropped sensors definately have thier place in the world of photography.This camera along with alot of Canon dslr cameras has a sensor crop of 1.6x.Also not the ideal camera for fast action captures.You can time it right and get a great pic,but the slower frame rate per second is somewhat a dilema,especially when filming birds or shooting a sequence of a race car rounding a corner or quaterback throwing a football.The 7 points of focus are adequate but not always enough.There is not a spot metering feature on this camera,but there is a partial metering which is not as bad as some may think.Very much a plus when taking a portrait with alot of backlight.Another 'quark' is that the viewfinder is rather small,which when I started,forced me to use the lcd screen to set exposure and composition,which is not ideal.I now use it to read the histogram,after doing so then Ill adjust accordingly.Just another feature I found useful after learning over time about photography.Pros:The 8mp is plenty for blwoing up prints.If you plan on blowing them up over 16x20 then I could see where the quality of the picture would decline,SLIGHTLY.But for sizes up to that it is very detailed and crisp.The auto mode will most likely be the best place to start.The camera will adjust the settings according to what youre pointing at.Essentially a point and shoot camera,when in this mode.Then you have the other modes such as portraits,landscapes,macro,etc etc that are designed for their designated purposes.Very handy and a great learning tool for the more hands-on modes such as aperture(AV),shutter speed(TV),etc etc.The Program mode is where you can learn about exposure,the camera will evaluate,set the shutterspeed and aperture and you will be able to alter the exposure and flash output.Very very handy when learning.As for the AV,TV,M modes,those are the ultra self adjusting features,the possibilities are almost endless when you grasp these modes.The wide range of lenses you can buy,EF or EF-S,are a definate plus for this camera.From the ultra wide to the super zoom.Theyll work with this camera.Why people have opted to go for the XTi over the XT is personal preference.Remember it does not change the quality of the image taken.The colors and detail in the pictures from this camera are top notch,much like alot of Canon cameras.The weight of this camera is very comfortable,again something some people take into consideration when buying,personally it didnt have any bearing on my decision,but thought it should be mentioned.This is also a fantastic camera for portraits and landscapes.Final Words:This is a beautiful camera that produces beautiful captures.A must have for any beginner dslr'er out there.A great learning tool as well.I have graduated to from a 4mp pocket camera,to a 6mp dslr-like Powershot S3,and I am now at this camera.I have used this camera and have gained knowledge about photography from this camera.Ive heard,and will agree,that this is a great camera to eventually figure out what kind of photography you want to do,whether it be weddings,landscapes,portraits or fast action,high speed.I have discovered that I want to venture into fast action,such as sports.Therefore this camera wouldnt be the top choice,that would be the 1D Mark II N.But again,I feel this camera has taught me enough about different styles and purposes of the camera bodies out there,which has in turned guided me to which style I want to pursue.And if youre wondering why I didnt opt for the XTi,its wasnt because it was higher it was because I felt this would be able to teach me the basics of the technical side to photography.Im not one to buy into the whole more mega pixel always means better pictures.Under most circumstance it really is irrelevant and if I were to present to you well taken photos from the XTi(10mp) and the XT(8mp),Im safe in saying I would bet that you couldnt tell the difference.It comes down to the photographer that decides what a photo will look like.Every camera can take poor,bad quality pictures if the person behind the viewfinder isnt well edjucated about the technical side of photography.Thus why I think this camera is a tool used for that purpose,to edjucate.If you get this camera you wont be sorry,a very very nice camera.If you are more concerned about looks and the feel of a camera than I suppose you can opt for the XTi,not a bad choice,very nice indeed,but not a large enough improvement for me to upgrade to it.So have fun with photography,it can get in your blood,and see you down the road.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"},

and have worked with it enough to use most of the features without the manual.  It's not overly complex, but there's a lot to know, and much of it isn't intuitive.  Overall, I'd give their user-interface design a rating of 3.With the right settings and a good lens, it takes terrific pictures, and the various program modes are well thought out and executed.  I have to work pretty hard to take better pictures in manual mode than the camera will select automatically.  I thoroughly enjoy the various degrees of manual intervention that are available, though...you can control as few or as many elements as you like, and let the camera make decisions on those elements you don't want to think about.As another reviewer stated...the custom white balance process is pretty awkward, although once you get used to it, you can do it quickly.  Basically, you have to take a picture of something white, then use the picture file to set the WB.  It would be much easier to do it in a single step without taking a picture...just by pointing the camera at the white reference.It is very small compared to other DSLR's, and that suits me just fine (although there are folks that don't like it, including a buddy of mine who's a Nikon fan).  As a result, it DOES look more like a consumer camera than a pro, but that's not a big deal for me...I'd rather have the convenience that the small size offers.My only REAL beef is the kit lens...it's barely passable, and feels very cheap.  Manual focus is difficult, because the focusing ring isn't \"tight\" enough to be accurate,  It focuses just fine in auto mode, although this is NOT a terribly sharp lens.  I've borrowed better Canon lenses from a few friends, and they make HUGE differences in the quality of photos.

I found that and a lot more in the Rebel XT 350D.  A lot of camera in one small, very low-priced unit.I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to get into serious digital photography.  This camera will do just about anything you would or could get from another $2K or so.  So, why spend it on the body when you can on the lenses.  That's what I did.I would also recommend that you purchase the battery-grip as well.  Not so much for the extra battery power -which is nice; especially on remote shootings - but for the balance and feel of the unit. It make a world of difference in the feel.NOTE: The very low-cost, yet extensive array of settings and adjustments (many found on the higher-end DSLRs) make this one of the best buys in Digital photography.ofieldstream", "Date": "July 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "My first SLR - a review of a different color", "Author": "Random Techie", "ReviewID": "R3S3I70PZS8LJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched this camera and lenses online, and chose it for my first SLR. I have previously have a Nikon 900 and a Nikon 990, both used for web-product photography, currently I have a Nikon 8700.When I went in to buy the XT Rebel, they sold me a filter kit and said \"with these you'll never need PhotoShop.\" That was amusing, since I'm not a photog (I'm a computer person) and I love PhotoShop. According to my online research, the filters can double as a lens protector, so I got them in case I ever felt the need to reach for them. This review is not a performance review of the XT Rebel because I don't know how to use the camera well enough to exercise all its features.What I do wish to convey are the differences between a Nikon 8700 type camera, \"P&S;\" (point and shoot), versus my first SLR camera, this Canon XT Rebel. It took me a long time to realize that these constitute two entirely different kinds of cameras.Autofocus: this SLR has an autofocus capability on steroids. My Nikon takes great photos, on a tripod or if I'm sitting. But should I try something as simple as pointing it at one of the small furry creatures living here too, it generally won't (auto-) focus. And you can't focus it otherwise, really, because you can't tell through the viewfinder or LCD whether it's truly focused, as compared to viewing it on your computer. FINALLY with the XT Rebel I can point it, hold down the snapshot button halfway, and get an instant autofocus. It's like The Terminator locking in on whatever you're pointing at. I am so happy.A minor difference is that the LCD monitor on the XT Rebel cannot be used as a viewfinder for shooting, you MUST look through the viewfinder. That means smooshing your face up against the back of the camera. I think they sell little viewfinder hoodies to alleviate that.Memory: this type of camera allows many shots in quick succession, which I have no plans on using. But this is one of the major differences between the two camera types: this XLR has a large amount of memory in the camera body, else it would be impossible to take so many photos so quickly. It takes a while to load large photos onto a CF card. What I don't understand is why manufacturers and reviewers don't list (or figure out) how much memory is in the camera itself...this would seem like a fundamental spec, like the various levels of cache on different CPUs, even within the same product family. It would certainly have helped me catch on much earlier to the differences between the two camera types, if this spec had been waved around at all.I purchased a Sandisk 1 Gb Extreme III card, which supposedly has a 133X speed rating. But it seems like you don't need that speedy of a card, given the buffer memory in the body of the XT Rebel. You could just buy a cheap 4 Gb IBM microdrive, I think.Zoom: on my Nikon 8700 camera, you push a lever to zoom in or out, with an accompanying SHZZZZZ sound as the lens moves in or out, slowwwly. For the XT Rebel, you grab the zoom part of the lens and twist it. The other part of the lens that can be twisted is the focus part...I'll leave that to photogs. On this XT Rebel the lens does NOT MOVE to autofocus. An internal mechanism inside the lens does that, and very quickly too.The Canon lens can have a USM, Ultra Sonic Motor, which means that the internal focusing mechanism is damn fast. Although I bought the kit version in black with the EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6, I haven't used it yet. It turns out the best Canon lenses have an \"L\" designation, so I bought a Canon EF 24-70/2.8 L USM (77MM). The first set of numbers, 24-70, means a zoom range (remember that I'm not a photog ;-), and the \"2.8\" means...well, it's complicated. It's called an \"f-stop\" and means how big the aperture is, or lens opening to feed the pixel sensor. A larger aperture is denoted by a smaller number, and it means the lens is better in low-light situations. This spec is also (annoyingly) called a \"speed\" setting. Indeed, I am annoyed at many of the specs being related to a 35mm film camera, a relic of the previous century. There is an apparent purpose though: as the prices keep coming down and the technology has moore oomph, the consumer digital cameras will finally match the historical ratings of film cameras in some way. That's why there's a \"(77MM)\" spec on that last lens, something to do with comparison to the old film cameras.The lens I bought, the EF 24-70/2.8 L USM, is heavy, 2.1 pounds. It totally dominates the camera body, and two hands must be used for a shot, one to grab the lens. The kit is much smaller and probably doesn't require two hands. The next lens I might buy is the Canon EF 70-200 f/2.8L IS USM Lens. The \"IS\" stands for Image Stabilization, which is within the lens itself, and can be toggled on/off.The thing about having 8 megapixel cameras is that the slightest movement when shooting might cause a blur. I've been able to hand-hold my new camera-lens for indoor shots with no problem though. The IS in the other lens will help fixup such a problem, like stabilization on a camcorder. Otherwise, use a tripod.Here are detail pages on the two lens:[...][...]The second lens is so heavy that it is the lens that mounts onto a tripod, not the camera!!!This is an excellent site for a hard-core review of the XT Rebel / EOS 350D:[...]The Canon Xt Rebel has effortlessly taken great pictures for me, indoors.

In old churches, even.The only downside with the camera is that your 50mm lens becomes an 80mm, and it's very expensive to get anything equivalent to a wide angle lens on a film SLR because you need it to be a 20mm or less.

I tried the simple in your pocket digital camera which is great and a smaller somewhat SLR camera that was also nice but there is just something about the heft of a real SLR camera and the joy of lenses etc.I almost didn't buy this camera w/ the 18-55 lens becuase I have several lenses already from my Canon film SLR, but I am glad I went with the lens on this unit. It has a terrific range and may save me from having to take a bunch of lenses with me on vacation. Speaking of lenses: I have two Canon lenses and 1 Sigma that I used w/ my film SLR w/ no issues. At first I was very worried when I got this camera b/c all the research said my old lenses would work, however, I was having trouble getting them to go on. The film lenses have metal mountings whereas the digital has plastic mountings, this meant--for me at least--that I had to get them on by very specifically placing the openings. Once you get the hang of it-it is ok, but warning that you won't be switching the lenses off and on as quickly as you might be used to. That being said the included lens is AMAZING!Another note about lenses because I found this out shortly before purchasing. Your old lenses most likely will not be as accurate as their numbers say. The digital will read them at about a 1.6 focal length difference which is great for a telescopic lens as it will make it have a wider range, for a macro however it pretty much defeats its usage. You can look up more details about how the numbers work online.Good POINTS:Camera is quiet. Takes pictures well inside and out. Battery life is great, I have yet to charge mine. It accepts my old mini-tripod and shutter release from my film SLR. The setting variety is great, especially the bracketing feature--I leave mine on that or on the TV setting for when I want to pick it up and take a quick picture. Comes with a nice manual and pocket manual. Pictures printed from not even the highest setting on this camera at 8 x 10 were frameable.Lower POINTS:Finding the setting for black and white was a bit difficult. It takes getting used to having a larger camera again after carrying a small one.This is a great camera though. And for everyone who says you need the 10MP XTI, don't listen.

I'm partial to an eclectic review I wrote on my blog -- if you want to read it Google on [Gordon's Tech Digital Rebel XT review] and you'll find it. (Amazon does not allow one to put URLs in a review).I won't repeat the full review here; instead I'll focus on ... getting sharp images. The negative reviews on Amazon complain about out-of-focus images. I think I can help.If you've used a consumer digital camera with a tiny CCD sensor, you've gotten used to great depth of field. The APS-sized (2x3 aspect ratio btw, not 3x4!) sensor on this camera is big enough that depth of field is back. When I use my 50mm Canon 1.8 (equivalent of 80mm on 35mm camera) the depth of focus is inches.  That's not much to work with.Also, the 'smart' 8 point focus tends to fail for me. I got much better results when I switched to a single focus point and started using focus lock.Lastly, the default built-in flash settings favors an odd combination of flash and long exposures (so one gets the background exposed) along with wide open lens and ISO 400 sensitivity (to reduce power drain?). Bad choices for most of us.You can fix the flash behavior. Read the manual carefully, there's an esoteric setting that fixes the shutter speed to 1/200 sec with Av flash pictures. Use that setting and use Aperture priority for flash images, set your lens to f 4 or better, ISO to 200 and you can expect sharp flash pictures.I think this is a solid camera, despite the annoying rattle in the flash unit \"arms\".

I liked the d70 very much, also the quality of the Nikon kit lens is much more better than the canon kit lens, take that into consideration seriously, just do a search on google for the price of the Nikon 18-70mm lens v.s. the price for the Canon 18-55mm lens.When moving into SLR camera, in future years, you will probably stick with your lenses and just upgrade the body, lens technology does not change as camera bodies do.

Why buy a camera with limited capabilities, even if you are a beginner?  By the way, we all know its the LENSE that takes the picture, the camera just processes the information.

One of these is a comment about the fact that the camera is faster than the original Rebel due to the 8 MP CMOS and DIGIC II processing image.  This gives it higher resolution, faster recovery time between shots and almost instant startup time when compared with the original Rebel.  I found the camera overall to be a bargain considering its performance and the fact that they included a good lens.Two modes that I appreciated were the While Balance Bracketing and monochrome mode for working with black and white photography.  The bracketing allows you to automatically take three images for every shot with different white balancing settings.  Given that I can erase the pictures I don't like, I think this is a great feature.  I also like that I can experiment with black and white photography.Another interesting feature of the camera is the CloseUp mode.  It works at wide angle settings and at 55 mm as well.  When you use it at 55 mm it magnifies the image and you can focus in as close as 6 inches in order to capture detail in flowers or whatever your subject is.  This opens up a lot of possibilities for some interesting shots that would otherwise be difficult.In short, this is a lot of camera for the price.  I am very pleased with my purchase and pictures can be blown up very large at 8 MP resolution.While I haven't tried it yet, I'm interested in experimenting with some astrophotography using this camera.

I wanted a camera that I could use for the next 5 years.  I also went ahead and bought the recommended telephoto lens, the external flash and a 1GB flash card.  I have been using the camera for about 1 year now and I can say that I'm reasonably satisfied with it.  I did read all the reviews about it before purchase so I was aware that it had a 'problem' with under exposed shots when the flash is used at night.  I thought I could live with that, as I was told that setting the White Balance (WB) to the appropriate setting would eliminate the underexposure.  I have not found that to be the case and this has made me very wary about taking shots with the flash at night.  I constantly have to check to see if the shot looks ok before the subjects move away.  I think I need some guidance as to how to correct this issue once and for all.One thing which surprised me was the filesize. Being an 8 megapixel camera, the smallest filesize still approaches half a megabyte.  Trying to e-mail photos to my friends quickly fills up their inbox and often I have to zip and send files multiple times to send all the required files.  The other thing which surprised me was that I had to use the viewfinder to take the pictures.  Being an SLR, you can't use the LCD when taking shots.  The LCD is used for review only.  I was not aware of that having been acustomed to my G2 but that was more my ignorance than a fault of the camera.

I love this camera, the quality of its picture taking and how very EASY it is to use. For a photography novice like me using a professional grade digital camera like this it is super easy to use. Canon makes great cameras.HOWEVER....the CFS cards (which is basically the term they use for memory cards) plug into a slot inside the side of the camera. The cards have a series of holes that align into tiny copper prongs inside the camera. It does not take magnetized memory cards like a lot of digital cameras do. Twice I have run into the problem where since I use multiple memory cards and am VERY careful when removing and inserting them-at some point one of the delicate prongs that the card plugs into gets slightly shifted and therefore it would not plug in correctly and completely prevents you from taking or saving pictures unless you get it fixed (You will get a message on the screen saying \"CFS error.\" At first I thought I had purchased a faulty memory card-but soon learned from a representative at Canon that unfortunately it was not the card but when inserting and removing these cards a lot of people have run into this problem--SO I just wanted to warn you all that it can become a MAJOR inconvenience to you if this happens as it can take some time to fix (although it's a simple problem to fix.) The first time it happened to me, I sent it in to Canon's repair center and they had it fixed just as new for FREE because it has a warranty, but it took six weeks. The second time it happened, I took it to a local authorized Canon technician who also fixed it for free since it is still under warranty.My advice and what I am going to do is buy a memory card that holds the largest amount of gigabytes possible and just never remove the card so that the prongs will not get compromised. Once the memory card is full-there is no need to take it out to upload the digital images-that is done through an adapter/usb cord. So....I am just going to keep this new memory card inserted indefinitely-upload the photos onto my computer or a  CD when it gets full (which takes forever because it takes loads of photos on the 2.0 GB cards even on the highest quality picture taking setting) TO PREVENT THIS PROBLEM FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN.Other than that, I'm in love with this camera and the user guide makes everything so simple and I learn new techniques every time I use it, because it has so many amazing features.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "A Great Beginner's Camera, Still Doesn't Replace Film", "Author": "M.

They were impressed, it came from a digital camera and didn't look \"digital\" what ever that means.

In the smallest branches and twigs, the digital broke up, couldn't handle the detail.  The Kodachrome handled the detail with ease.Here's what I think.  Digital cameras are wonderful for making photos without film.  Yet film is good at high resolution down to the size of silver halide crystals.Theoretically, 12 megapixels is about where you reach the limit of film.  When you get to 18 megapixels, you are able to deliver medium format quality, that's where it really starts getting interesting.", "Date": "October 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "A thousand pictures to explain one word", "Author": "Imaginor \"Imaginor\"", "ReviewID": "R2XMYKG7MDFQQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a couple hundred more, I could have gotten the 10MP toy.  But then I would have had to figure out how to add a star to this rating.  I bought this toy/tool for my work photos (I do custom woodwork and glass etch (home improvement, art, etc.)) and wanted a camera that didn't fight me for every photo. In short, a camera which was reasonably easy to operate, but which would not have to be upgraded any time soon.  Currently, I only have the stock lens.  Though it is going to take a little time to get to know the intricacies of operating this toy for that museum quality photo, I am able to get great photos from the start.  The menus are far easier to navigate than my point and shoot (an Olympus C4000). I just have to remember to switch between program options (e.g., close up and portrait group, shutter and priority group).  Too, of course, the camera can grow in capability, since the lenses put me back in the category of a 35mm SLR.  While I miss the on screen view finder, for setting up certain shots, the trade off in quality of an SLR makes it easier to tolerate that compromise.  The quality of shots with the stock cheap lens are so good, compared to my previous camera, I long for the time I can compare photos by it with a quality lens.  My next investment for the camera will be a zoom lens.  I'm not a pro, so the loss of quality, as compared to a fixed lens, shouldn't hurt too much, especially since the choice available is compromise or forgo the increased capability entirely.  I bought the extra battery with this. I've had the camera a month, shot a couple hundred photos and at least twenty percent were with a flash. I'm still running on the same battery. Sweet deal.  I bought the 4 gig flash card.  You can have my house, my car or my dog, but leave this card alone.  Before, I had to plan my shots and download daily to clear it for the next round.  I was limited to around twenty shots.  Now I can shoot for a couple weeks and barely dent the card's capacity.  It will hold around four or five hundred high quality photos. If I went to low res, well, that exceeds human capacities for comprehension of infinity (okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but you get the point). There has been a lot of good advice from people far more learned in photography than I, so I won't attempt to further remark on this camera's virtues.  I would, however, offer the following:  (1) While a point-and-shoot may be right for many, if there is a chance you will get the photography bug, might want to expand your abilities, might need the versatility of better lenses at some point, or just like awesome toys, make the jump to a SLR digital.  (2) If your camera didn't come with it, shop around for a good quality photo editing program.  It doesn't have to be high end, but should allow for effects, album management and so forth.  That can be almost as important as a quality lense.", "Date": "January 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "David W.

My favorite feature is how easily I was able to take pictures from my powerbook. The photos displayed on my screen almost immediately.

It even has AI-Servo mode, which was a good enough reason for me to upgrade from my Digital Rebel alone, as I shoot ice hockey when I can. Conversely, I don't think it's overladen with features. It lacks a spot meter for example. Bob, do us all a favour and never pick up a professional camera, as you'll moan about \"too many features\" for weeks.Secondly, of course you can't use the lcd as a viewfinder! It's an SLR! There's a great big mirror in the way!Macro mode? You claim to have used an SLR before? Surely with all your experience you're using aperture priority and mirror-lock up at the very least with your macro photos? The macro performance is based purely on the lens you use and its close-focusing distance. The tiny lenses you find on compact digitals are suited to macro photography due to their tiny focal length and hence large depth of field. An SLR lens will never be able to focus as close, unless it's designed for macro work.It seems to me that you're not very experienced and don't understand how your camera works, nor the differences between compact and slr cameras.

You can rest assured in knowing that there is no possibe way to go wrong if you're considering the purchase of one of the most intelligent and powerful high-end digital cameras on the market. The Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera, that comes complete with an awesome Canon EF-S 18-55mm (f3.3-5.6) lens, is the highest performing high-end digital camera that I have ever used. If you read nothing more-know that you are making a sound purchase and if you're purchasing as a gift-you simply couldn't be more thoughtful or generous!With so many brands on the market and so many choices, where does one begin to find the right camera for their personal and professional needs? Where does a photographer or the average enthusiast start to isolate the camera that they want to buy for themselves or as a gift? Do I just need to focus on the impressive 8 Megapixels technology or is there more I need to consider?If you're either new to digital photography or new to Canon, you should feel very confident that this Canon Digital Rebel XT is one of the best digital cameras ever produced. I really do hope that this personal and honest review will help you narrow your search and help you develop more faith in what you're buying. I'm assuming that you probably have a good deal of experience with photography or you're a person that appreciates great photography. So if you're looking for an outstanding digital camera at a Professional Level, you've found it with this monumental digital camera from Canon. This is a VERY dependable camera, clearly at the top of the almost all the reviews I've thoroughly researched while doing my homework for this important review. If you're a photographer, you know how great it feels to put a great machine in your hands. Your confidence as a photographer immediately improves with a camera that offers an awesome array of important performance features. The Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 Lens is as sturdy and comfortable as they make them! And with 8MP quality and a fantastic Canon 18-55mm lens, you have a complete camera package that only lacks someone to take the photographs!This Canon Rebel XT (Digital 8MP) camera will always take incredible color-rich and vivid photos for you-even if you make a slight mistake or move your hands just a tiny bit when photographing. It actually has a great deal of technology that is built-in and designed to compensate for anyone who might be in a poor lighting situation or someone who forgets to focus well before shooting the picture. Don't worry if you are a bit unsteady as the technology will help to compensate for any small movements. I typically use the function that allows the camera to call all the shots. At first I wasn't comfortable in doing that, but soon learned that Canon's technology has far surpassed my own abilities-for the most part. However, even though you can have the Rebel \"Call All The Shots\", you are always abled to manually handle absolutely any function that you might want to adjust. What more could anyone ask? I'll never forget how impressed I was with the first set of photos I had printed. I was in a hurry and had no time to make any adjustments with the incredible software that is included with the Canon package. When I went to pick up the photos, which only took about 30 minutes, I could not believe how \"perfect\" the photos looked to me.Canon Digital Cameras are pretty hard to compare with others in the this high-end digital arena. I've had Powershots for a long time and I've taken over five thousand photos with them-they stand up against my accidental drops or drops of rain when I've exposed the camera to water. This Rebel XT Digital Camera is a couple notches well above the Powershots and is perfect for anyone.Aside for requiring powerful batteries that use a good amount of power, there is no downside to this incredible digital camera from a great digital camera maker. I've been able to have these photographs enlarged to poster size and found them to be as vivid (even close up) as I could ever have imagined. With 8 Megapixels, sizes like 8x10's are not even a concern when enlarging.Canon was in the camera business decades before digital cameras were even on the market and they've really pushed the digital envelope with this camera. If you're looking for a gift for someone who is an avid photographer, or a professional, and likes digital photography, you've found it in the Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 Lens. You can stop looking and place your order now. Your recipient will be extrememly satisfied with the ease of use and the high quality of this great camera.If you are an avid photographer, like myself, and wish to have a great camera for digital shots-this is the baby you'll want to buy! If you're looking to take photographs that you will likely enlarge to 5x7's, 8x10's or larger, this camera has enough power and technology to do the job without looking like a digital photograph. Often my framed digital prints look better than my photographs taken with film-something I never thought would happen!There is a great deal of information that you can read about this camera on the Canon website and other review sites online. You can compare the camera with others in the same category. You might find some slightly better deals with other brands that might offer even larger amounts of Megapixels. That really is NOT what you should be looking for. Often the number of Megapixels is only possible with the use of special software to inerpolate the photographs. You don't want to have to worry about all of that. You are set with the Canon that truly delivers 8.0 VIVID Megapixels!Canon puts together an entire Kit or Package when you buy the Digital Rebel XT. I wanted to also let you know that the software that's included with the camera package is fantastic and is literally worth the price of the camera in itself. However, you're getting a super package with this deal and a camera that can depend on for as long as you want to own the camera. I've exposed it mine to rain about 10 different times, and I've not EVER had any even a small incidental problem. reminds me of the Energizer Bunny-It just keeps on Going and Going and Going and never stops!

I have caught far better pics than ever before with my previous camera.  The first set of prints I ordered online are wonderful.  For action shots this camera is perfect.  The advantage of the SLR is that you don't have the delay found in the majority of point-and-shoot cameras marketed to people like me, and the burst rate is more than an amateur like me would need.  I found that the P&S; type of camera caused me to miss the good shot more frequently than getting the good shot.  Make sure to get a big memory Compact Flash card.  I've found good deals for 2 gig cards with rebates, which can hold 500+ pics in JPEG format, and still a few hundred even if you shoot in the RAW format.  I have not found problems with the 40X write speed.  The battery life is very reasonable, allowing at least 250 shots before recharging in my exerience.  I also recommend shopping for extra batteries, which can be found for a very good deal for the non Canon brand.  I have not noticed any problems with the lower priced battery.  I purchased the optional battery pack, not really for extended battery life (it holds two batteries), but because I wanted a larger grip area and the pack has extra controls and shutter button for vertical shooting, which I find to be a huge advantage.  The software that comes with the camera is reasonable at doing basic photo editing (red eye reduction, etc.), but those who are more into it probably would be happier getting 3rd party software for in depth editing.  I also bought the Lowepro 100 Slingshot pack to carry the camera.  It just fits this model with room to spare for accessories.

Save your money on the Rebel XTi and purchase the XT, so you can invest in some nice lenses, filters, etc.  A nicer lens will get you a lot farther than a slightly larger LCD screen and 2 megapixels will.  Honestly, unless you are looking to blow up you pictures to a full poster size, there is no need for more MP as they don't determine the sharpness of your photos; they determine how large you can blow your prints up while not distorting them.As for the LCD screen, whether you have a 1.8 or a 2.5 inch, the screen is so small that every photo will look sharp until you put it on your faithful computer screen; when the real truth comes out.  So regardless of 1.8 or 2.5, you still need to zoom in on every photo on the screen to check for sharpness.This camera does shoot in RAW as well which is always a nice plus.The size of this camera has been a concern for some.

I have been using 35 mm SLR cameras for over 40 years.I am really impressed!  While this is not Canon's or anyone elses top of the line, it is a great choice for an amteur or semi-professional photographer.I have been a technical writer, so I need photos both in color and B&W.;  With 35 mm film SLR, I always carried two - one with color and one with black and white film.  With the Digital Rebel, I can take both color and B&W; with a single camera - a real plus.  Since a lot of my photos have been taken in a manufacturing plant or in the field, I like the image stabilized EF lenses and the ability to select either aperture or shutter priority - and let the camera thoose the appropriate shutter speed or aperture.

The main reason for the switch was because I wanted to take night shot without having the lag that is normally associated with Point and Shoot cameras. My impression:The Good stuff:-Camera shutter speed is fast. It was better than I had expected.-Easier to use than expected.-Shoots great photos in Auto mode-Good amount of manual selections to work with-Lightweight and small-Compatible with many Canon lenses-Priced very low for a DSLRThe Bad stuff (opinion):-Camera feels cheap. Too much plastic, but I'm sure canon had to cut cost somewhere to be able to sell the camera this cheap. At least they cheapen the external rather than the internal.-Cannot turn off flash in some mode. You'll have to either set the exposure, aperture, or the contrast in order for the flash to not come on. It's very annoying since some of the photos I want to take do not need more light.-The camera will not take pictures because there is not enough light for a particular setting. I cannot see why the camera cannot just let me take the photo and let me do whatever I want with it. I am using the camera to take picture. I'm the photographer, not the camera.-LCD screen is a bit small (hence the XTi is better in this department)-Camera kit does not come with a standard memory card. I recommend at least 1GB. You'll be taking more pictures than you'll anticipate.Conclusion: For the price I paid for this camera, I am happy with my purchase. It's a great camera, and I can see why it's been one of the best selling cameras in the world. However, if you can fork out a bit more for the XTi, I would recommend so for the bigger LCD and the self-sensor cleaning system.

If you have larger hands I would suggest getting a battery pack grip to make it more comfortable.The pictures so far have come out stunning using the kit lens. The kit lens is pretty flexible and will be able to take 90% of the shots you will need. However, I would suggest getting other lenses if you need to be a bit more creative.

This Canon 350D is a digital replacement for my N75. My family loves Nikon and during my search for a digital camera it was difficult passing over the Nikon D70, but only initially. The size, weight, and feel of the Rebel XT is comparable to my N75. I have small hands and found the D70/D50 and even other Canon SLRs to be too large and quite heavy. I am the sort of person who enjoys bringing my camera everywhere; toss it in a bag or backpack and go. The only real difference in weight now is very minimal, even with the battery pack.I haven't read the manual yet. The controls are pretty intuitive and fun to play around with. Connection to my PC is pretty simple. I'm not too excited with the Zoom browser software. I'm going to kill it and remove it from my pc soon. It's just a silly interface and I really prefer the simplicity of XP's Explore browser which is sufficient.This camera has a USB 2 connection which I don't have yet. I've taken about 200 photos the past 3 days in large format and upload time hasn't been an issue using my 1.0 USB ports. My USB 2.0 PC card will arrive soon and I am looking forward to seeing the difference in speed. I will update my review then.I bought the body and lens kit. I thought I might be annoyed with the lens since I'm used to 28-80, but I find that it's an easy move to 18-55. As for a true critique in the quality of this particular lens, I am not qualified for I am an amateur photographer/hobbyist. (...) I hope my experience helps someone with their decision in the pursuit of purchasing a digital SLR regardless whether this is the choice or not.----Update 8/8/05I had a month of shooting with this camer. I've taken over 600 shots all in large format without delay due to writing. I have a sandisk Ultra II 1Gb CF. A large percentage of these photos are images of people. There is no shutter delay; quick and responsive focusing to handle the most animated of my friends and even the family cat. I've had no problems shooting indoors in low lighting  to a brifght sunny day outdoors. One thing: indoors the flash can be excessive and I tend to turn it off or go manual.Battery: Power is eaten up with viewfinder preview. I turn turn off that option.USB 2.0: NiceWith all of the reviews I've read about folks manipulating their images after using their d-SLRs I was pretty apprehensive, but I've had no need to do this. Simply learn the different settings that should be used in different environments.There continues to be complaints regarding the size of this camera being too small.

It is a great camera and everyone loves it. It has a ton of features. I bought this camera and here are a few things that I didn't easily find out when researching it that you may find helpful.1. You cannot see an image on the LCD before you take you picture. So you look through the eyepiece like a regular camera. At first I didn't like this since I was used to the Sony 828 model. But now I am used to it and don't mind it at all.2. You can take pictures considerably faster than similar cameras like the Sony 828. If you have the faster memory card you can take pictures nearly as fast as a regular camera. This is one of the first things Sony owners noticed when using my camera.3. This camera is more complicated than a Sony model. Having knowledge of photography and settings is extremely helpful.4. The flash on this camera compared to the Sony 828 doesn't seem to be as good.5. The software that comes with this camera is EXTREMELY bulky. Just getting the images off my camera to my computer is a major chore. Many times it starts to download them but then hangs etc. I need to have a full battery usually to get a few hundreds pictures transferred. The software is a real drag. There are some cool features of the software, but overall since it is so bulky and slow it really would make me consider a different camera in the future. I would recommend buying a memory card reader if you buy this camera.So basically this is a great camera that takes great pictures. It is very responsive and works as it says. It is upgradeable with lenses and is probably the closest thing you can get to a real camera. But Canon really has to spend some more time making their software responsive and work better. I give a 4 star rating only because of the software given with this camera. The Sony 828 when hooked up to a computer will show up like a drive and you can easily copy the pictures to your hard drive.

My batteries have always lasted a long time before needing to be recharged; when I shot sports I could use one battery for roughly the whole day.

The Canon lenses are also fantastic; I have owned the high-quality standard 50/1.4, the portrait 85/1.8, the mid telephoto 70-200/4.0, the amazing 100/2.8 macro,and the wide-angle 17-40 L.  These are all fantastic lenses to put on your Rebel, and you can rest assured that there is a whole range of Canon products to suit your needs.  The only downside to these products is that they are quite expensive.As far as the Rebel, the only complaints I have are these:  1. The amount of noise at 1600 ISO makes these pictures generally unusable.  2. The AF system is not robust enough for sports; you can do it but it's hard.  3. The grip, somewhat small, can take getting used to.  4. The camera can't take too many RAW or high quality JPEG pictures in succession (important for sports).In general this camera is a dream for most peoples uses.

Close ups look alot less distorted with the XT. In auto mode the XT is just as easy to use, except it takes pictures faster. And it's cooler to have a camera that looks like a camera.

It takes beautiful pictures, given the right lens and creativity.2. It is affordable, especially in the aftermarket.3. It can take EF-S and EF lenses. (Canon 5D and on do not take EF-S lenses.)4. Light weight, good for travel.5. Battery grip allows increased power and better grip for vertical/horizontal shots.6. Fast start up time.7. Seven AF points8. E-TTL II compatibilityCon's-----1. Low light noise at ISO 400 and higher.2. Relatively minor con: not weather sealed.  If you want to take pictures in tough weather, make sure you buy cover.3. If you change lenses a lot, buy a blower to be able to clean dust.4. Limited ISO range, only up to 16005. Small viewfinderTips----* You have a crop factor of 1.6.  So if you have a 10mm lens, you effectively have a 16mm lens.* Use a different flash to be more creative like bouncing the light off the walls or ceiling.  You can't do that with the on-camera flash.* Battery grip is a definite buy, more power and better ergonomics.Conclusion----------The biggest issue with the 350D is the noise level in ISO 400 and more.  But if you shoot in good light or have a good flash, the 350D is the ultimate bang for the buck camera.  Its sensor size is also about the same as Canon's 400D, 10D, 20D, and 30D.

Meyers\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZJICMIZRIJFA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well,I spent my time researching DSLR cameras.  I will avoid the specific details but my main decision factor was price.  I wanted a camera that was under $700 (including a lens).  I realize that I was probably you typical DSLR researcher and buyer.  This was going to be my first DSLR camera, and I didn't want to break the bank while at the same time having room to expand.The Canon XT fit into the price range while giving me the options I wanted.  I didn't see the need to go up to the XTi, Nikon D40x, Nikon D80 because at 8 MP you can pretty much blow the XT pictures up to poster size and not really see huge loss in detail.  I also had the luxury of choosing between all the different brands because I didn't have any lens already purchased.  My main comparison came down to the Canon XT versus the Nikon D40.  Both were similar in price (with the kit lens included), but when I went to the local camera store to try them out (I still purchased from Amazon, no sales tax really gives Amazon an advantage here) I kept coming back to the Canon XT.The Canon XT has more autofocus points which were instantly apparent when I was just picking up the camera and trying to take pictures in the store.  Also, in a non-scientific statement the Canon just felt better in my hands.  I know it is made from plastic but it fit right into my hands and felt extremely comfortable.  The one item that I did like the Nikon over Canon was that the Nikon uses SD cards instead of CF in the Canon.  I just like SD better because most laptops now (including mine) have a slot where you can just slide the SD card in and the laptop reads the card exactly like a hard drive.  Also, in talking to the kind individuals in the camera store and in searching online I found that the Canon type of lens (AF) are more common and there are more generic (Tamron, etc) lenses available so over the long run (where as I have found out that you are going to pay alot more for your lenses then you ever will for your DSLR camera) so this was another selling point of the Canon XT.My first pictures with the camera were up in a trip to Alaska and the kit lens did OK but I could definitely see it limitations.  That being said for a difference of $70 between body only and body and lens, I think this lens will serve me well until my skills develop more.  I would rather learn on (and maybe break) the cheap kits lens and then move up to the better lens then start out dropping alot of money on expensive lenses.Overall, the Canon XT is everything I wanted it be.  It fits right into my hands, the autofocus is good, all the controls are available for any skill level from novice to pro, and I didn't break the bank to purchase it (I got the Canon XT (with kit lens), a 2 GB card, and I nice little holster bag all from Amazon for under $725).

Other Canon cameras I own include the Canon EOS 10S, the EOS Rebel G2, the EOS Elan 7, the EOS Rebel digital (6.3 MP) and now the EOS Rebel Digital XT.Canon products keep getting better and better and less expensive.  I used to be a big Minolta fan, but then Minolta did its swan dance and I got stuck with a couple of Minolta bodies and a bunch of Minolta lenses that were no longer supported.  That will never happen with a Canon camera.But back to the Rebel XT.  This camera has all the wonderful features that made the first EOS Rebel digital such a big hit and then improves upon them.  The obvious improvements are a smaller and lighter body as well as a bigger sensor (6.3 vs. 8.0 mp).  The other not so obvious improvements include much faster response time (I can't tell you how many shots I previously lost due to lag time) and a new accessory battery grip that takes rechargeable batteries as well as AA batteries.  While traveling is not always feasible to bring a charger along, so the ability to use standard and readily available AA bettereis is a major plus.This camera is a true joy to use.  I passed up on the XTi (like I passed up on the Elan 7E) because I do not need or want some of the extra complexities of the XTi model.  I don't need eye focusing (Elan 7E) and I don't need a CMOS self-cleaner (Rebel XTi).  It is not all that hard to occassionaly clean out the old CMOS.If this is your first digital SLR camera you will like the point-and-shoot auto modes found in the camera.  If you are a more advanced user you will benefit from all the shooting choices available with the camera.  In other words, this is a camera that you can grow with and will not soon outgrow.If you already own Canon, or Canon-mount lenses, then buy the body only and skip the kit.

Extremely fast focusing with kit lens AND sharp pictures at all focal lengths. Fast multiple-frame shots (3 fps) even with slow (4x) CF card. Low image noise at high ISO settings (vs. non-SLR digital cameras).Cons:Full Auto Exposure setting predominantly uses ISO 400 (instead of ISO 100) even in bright sunlight. No ability to frame shot using LCD (major SLR shortcoming). Focus screen and mirror dirty after just 3 days use (major SLR shortcoming). Small LCD which is difficult to see in bright sunlight. No retaining strap on lens cover.Detailed Review:I purchased Canon Digital Rebel XT with kit lens and 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 IS USM telephoto lens a week ago and have shot a wide variety indoors and outside with both lenses - 350 pictures total. The ability to change lenses and low noise at high ISO settings were the primary reasons this long-time non-SLR digital camera user purchased his first DSLR. The very good reported user experiences with the original Canon Digital Rebel, the availability of the new 8.2 megapixel Rebel XT for US$999, and a reasonable total user package price of $1500 after adding an image-stabilized Canon 75-300mm USM telephoto lens clinched the deal. With these two lenses I can cover a 35mm equivalent focal range of 27mm to 480mm and shoot clear, hand-held outdoor shots over entire range at ISO 100-400. Indoor telephoto shots up to 480mm are possible without flash, but I find ISO must be increased to 800 or 1600 for sharp hand-held shots.Very happy with the image quality of kit 18-55mm EF-S lens and the very fast focus times of this non-USM lens. It is also very light weight. I have found I mostly use Program exposure mode, since I can control the ISO setting, white balance mode, etc. I'm not happy with Full Auto Exposure mode choosing ISO 400 for outdoor shots in full sunlight (and all other shots). Why not use ISO 100?  Granted, there is no noise visible in outdoor ISO 400 shots until you zoom in on monitor-displayed image and the noise is not visible in 8x10 prints from my Canon i950 8-color printer except in shadows. Using ISO 100 in Program mode mostly eliminates this shadow noise.  I have found the A-DEP exposure mode useful for ensuring wider depth of field and sharp exposures, especially for telephoto shots. I have experienced more than a few grossly underexposed indoor flash pictures under fluorescent lighting (5-15 foot range) in Full Auto Exposure mode. Not sure what the problem is.Overall, however, I have been very pleased with the quality of the majority of pictures taken so far including:  macro shots, portraits, landscape photos, flash macro shots (no camera shadow), indoor flash pictures, and telephoto (all hand-held). Camera is ready-to-go the instant you turn it on. Can review pictures immediately on pressing review button and zoom in up to 10X. LCD can be hard to see (both pictures and camera settings) in bright sunlight. Increasing LCD brightness to maximum helps.  Viewfinder is bright and clear (duh, it's TTL optical) with good eye relief for eyeglass wearers.After an hour of outdoor shooting in windy conditions yesterday, however, a major problem developed.  The focus screen located inside the top of the camera body AND the internal mirror got contaminated with dust and yellow tree pollen.  I only had the internal camera body exposed for maybe 90 seconds total during the course of 4 lens changes.  I was able to get the mirror clean but I could not completely clean the focus screen - it's impossible to access with the dust blowers I have.  If I cannot keep camera internals clean over course of 3 days, what will happen over 6 months or a year of use?  What if the digital sensor gets dirty?  Also, I find the inability to use the LCD to frame pictures BEFORE taking them to be a BIG negative.  YES, I realize this is a \"feature\" of SLR cameras, but it still sucks.  For these two reasons, and the small LCD that is nearly unusable outdoors in bright sunlight, the camera has been returned.  Guess I'm not cut out for a digital SLR.  For those that are - the Canon Digital Rebel XT is a fine camera, and I can highly recommend the 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 IS USM lens.I also advise \"try it - before you buy it\" if this is possible, and definitely don't buy from a store that does not allow \"no-questions-asked\" \"no restocking fee\" returns for some period of time after purchase (2-4 weeks).", "Date": "March 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "A knockout", "Author": "Larry VanDeSande", "ReviewID": "R32UX2YROU21UN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a $400 credit and 10 percent off coupon at a national chain store and bought one of these for my wife for Christmas.

A family member of mine has a Canon XSi that I have used a few times, and I honestly think this camera is much better quality.-The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was that it was very small, very narrow.-In reviews, I read that this camera has a tiny view finder, equivalent to viewing \"a postage stamp at the end of a tunnel.\" I do not find this to be accurate. Sure, it would be nice for the viewfinder to be a tad larger, but its current size is perfectly manageable.-I was worried about the 8MP compared to the modern 12MP or so. I shouldn't have even hesitated. The detail on this thing is quite good. I uploaded three photos. One of paint splatters to show off its colour. Second of the Santa Fe railyard to show off its nice contrast. Third of a tree to show off its detail. Those pictures were taken with a 28-80 lens, rather than the kit lens.-One thing that really bugs me truly is the small LCD. I barely get an example of the image with that thing. The only true way I can determine if an image is good is when I upload it to my computer. Newer models have larger LCDs, some 3 inches, which I'm pretty sure is twice the one on the XT!-The memory cards for this thing are different than current models, and can go up into the $40's for only a few GB!(sandisk compact flash) Luckily mine came with one, but be warned.-Sometimes the shutter-release-button (not so great on my terminology yet) sticks. I'll hold it half-down to focus, and it won't take the picture when I try to push it down fully. Happens probably 3/10 shots. Mostly why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.So if you're a beginner, this camera is perfect for you.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect Tool for a Professional Beginner", "Author": "A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com \"What should ...", "ReviewID": "R1EZCLLBI1FT9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the Canon Rebel XT. I use it for work, where I manage communications for a high school. Despite that I have no real camera or photography training, I find the XT comfortable and easy to use. Although the school supplied me with this camera, when I next need to buy one for personal use, there is a good chance this will be my choice.I'm the chief paparazzo, taking candid pictures of students, teachers and events. We have pro photographers for major things, and they use higher level equipment, but for quick, on-the-spot shots, I grab the XT and am out the door.Images are clear every time, thanks to the camera accurately predicting what I am interested in. There is an auto/general pictures options, as well as context-specific options (distance, action, close-ups and others). The flash is perfectly timed and is at the correct level for whatever amount of light I need.The download software is quick, and interfaces with Windows with no conflicts.All images download as jpegs, so there are no conversion issues. I open them in Adobe Photoshop, and take it from there.It is small enough to carry discretely, but big enough to get the job done.I fully recommend the Canon Rebel XT.Anthony Trendl[...]", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Getting old, but a really great camera", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R20JOIB32TCNNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've taken more than 30,000 pictures with my XT and the biggest problem is that it does such a good job that I have a hard time justifying an upgrade. The images are great up to ISO 400 and very good at 800 and 1600. For the price it's hard to beat, but I'd probably recommend going for a newer camera with the ISO displayed in the viewfinder and a better auto focus system. Also, the included lens is so-so. I use a Sigma 17-70 which is excellent. The 3fps it captures is not quite fast enough for sports, but fine for kids.

I didn't use the camera for about a week and found it didn't work because of a dead battery, even though it had been fully charged. I bought a spare battery thinking it may have been defective, same thing even though I made sure the battery was fully charged and the camera was off. I then searched the online forums and found that this was a fairly common problem.  When I called Canon support they first tried to blame it on something I had done. I told them that there were numerous people with the same problem and canon should be aware of it and asked if they had a download that could fix it. Their reply was to remove the battery except when I was using the camera. I said: \"That is was not acceptable as too often once in a lifetime shots would be missed while fumbling to install a battery.\"  It was agreed that I should RMA the camera and although it was still under warranty it cost $$ to insure and ship it.  When it was finally returned (I missed all the holiday pics)  they claimed to have re-soldered a circuit board and replaced the tripod socket.  I don't believe they did anything and now the little latch that holds the battery in place is worn out and I use a rubber band to hold the battery in. It still takes good pictures though.", "Date": "July 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Much different, but not necessarily better, than a good point and shoot", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R30EBVWZ2L29QL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:  Very sharp contrast & detail even in low light; built in flash has good range; smaller & lighter than other DSLRs including the original rebel; zero shutter lag or shot to shot delay; uses compact flash cards which are inexpensive and easy to handle; can be upgraded to handle AA batteries; compatible with all EOS film camera EF lenses; lots of menu choices including customizing scenes; great Black/white mode.Cons: Kit lens results in underexposed pictures when using flash and automatic settings(which can be compensated for by using manual settings); automatic white balance not as good as many point & shoot cameras; can not effectively focus on two objects that are different depths even in aperture priorty or A-DEP modes (as many point and shoots can); much larger and heavier than almost all point and shoot cameras; good lenses are expensive; no image stabilization without special (expensive) lenses.Other thoughts: I think many people buy a DSLR because they think the image quality is much better than a point and shoot.  This is not necessarily true especially when using a cheaper lens (ie the kit lens) compared to a great point and shoot cameras such as the canon SD700, fuji f31fd, olympus C-7000 or panasonic DMC-FZ5.  I found a better lens than the bundled 18-55mm kit lens that sells very cheaply (especially used), the canon ef 28-80mm 1:3.5-5.6 which results in more realistic color and brightness especially in automatic mode.  A good point and shoot is much more practical for carrying around and really does as good a job for image quality under most situations and better in some others (such as photographing objects at different distances simultaneously and trying to keep all in focus).  The real advantages of this camera over a point and shoot are that almost every conceivable setiing can be changed manually; the availablility of so many lenses (though the really good ones are very expensive); the feel of a professional camera and much better flash range.  I believe that most people that buy this camera will also own (and use) a small point and shoot camera.  If you have no desire to use manual settings, consider this purchase carefully.  You may be better of with a good point and shoot (The DMC-FZ5 and SD700 are my favorites)", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "My first SLR", "Author": "Rogelio Velazquez", "ReviewID": "R1FLCJXKU9CLYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm completely impressed with this camera, the colors and the quality image is superb, well that in the opinion of someone who just has started in the SLR domain, but if you want to get started in the pro field this is one good choice.", "Date": "November 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "C.

It is a dream to use, lightweight, easy to hold, loooong battery life, (we're talking a week of use on one charge, using the LCD screen in moderation), and amazing auto and manual controls. The portrait and macro setting are particularly impressive and powerful. I plan to keep this camera for many years to come. If you're trying to make the decision between an 8 MP and a much more expensive 10 MP SLR, my vote is definitely for the 8 MegaPixel. You won't be disappointed. My only recommendation is that if you are looking for a powerful zoom lens, consider buying just the Rebel XY BODY and a more powerful zoom lens separately, because the 18-55 mm lens that comes with the Rebel--a great lens--does not have very deep zoom.

The only thing that I did not like is the lens; I changed it to a Sigma 14 - 200 mm, which is equal to 28 - 300 mm in a conventional SLR.

When I first held the camera in the store, I did not like the smallness of the camera.  I have average sized hands, but the camera still felt too small.  I have the original Canon Rebel, which always felt good in my grip.  I purchased the Xt despite the size (i am a megapixel junkie) and I am glad that I did.This camera is small, but mighty.  It is fast, sleek and caputres colors and subtle shadows flawlessly.  I settled on the silver finish, which looks classy and solid.  The original Rebel, although comfortable to hold, always looked a bit cheap, and too plastic like.  The new Xt does not.  I have yet to make an enlargement, but I am confident that I can go up to 16x20 inches without feeling a loss of quality.I am a high school art teacher with a degree in photography, so I have developed an eye for color and texture over the years.  I am very demanding of my photographic equipment.  I know that I will not be dissappointed with the Rebel Xt.I use a 512K memory card, which is on the small size, but does not seem to slow down the camera at all.  I am delighted with this purchase.  Considering the price difference between the Rebel Xt, and the Canon 20D, it does not make sense to spend $500.00 more for 1/2 a megapixel difference.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Xt  out performs and out sells the 20D.  So, my advice is BUY this camera.

I was torn between the XTi and the XT.  After doing much research, learning, and getting information overload, I decided for my needs, I'd pick up the XT.  From what I read, the difference in MP wouldn't be much of an issue for me.  The self cleaning on the XTi would be awesome.  It came down to an issue with money and \"wife\" approval.  At just under $600 with kit lens, the XT was \"psychologically\" a little easier to buy than the XTi.  Anyway, I'm in the tech field and began thinking of the bodies like computers.  New and better stuff will keep coming out faster and cheaper, in this hobby the lenses seem to be the real investment.Anyway, so far I love the camera.  I'm learning still but I do like the creative modes the XT offers.  Kind of like step learning.  I've got down all the terminology and what each thing does, but need to learn how it actually works and think the creative modes offered on XT are the perfect bridge.I have absolutely no complaints so far about the camera (although i did get the dreaded 99 error that I've read about, but I turned off the camera and it went away.  I hope I didn't get a dud).The Good:1.  Great value in my opinion2.  Camera feels good overall (some have complained about it being too light or feeling cheap).  I don't get this impression at all.  Although one of the cons I'm listing does have to do with the shape.3.  Easy to use with plenty of different modes to help you along the wayThe Bad:1.  Like others have complained, the grip feels a bit compacted.  I don't have really big hands, but it feels a tad unnatural holding the camera.  Its not terrible though, but its a little annoying2.  Not necessarily against this camera, but one thing I didn't think about is that you can't shoot with glasses on.  Too hard.  But it does have an adjustment that goes to -2.5 (right at my vision) and I can shoot with no glasses, or contacts.3.  The kit lens leaves something to be desired.  I'm a newbie and I can already feel the limitations of this lens.  Under sunny conditions, the lens performs pretty good, no complaints.  But indoor photography sucks for lack of a better word.  Plus the range doesn't seem useful.  Its a short telephoto and maybe a long wide.  Would I buy it with the kit lens?  Yeah, for only $70 or $80 more, I think its worth it.  However, if choosing b/w the kit lens and picking up the nifty fifty (Canon 50mm prime), I might have been better off picking up the body only and getting the nifty fifty.  I'll know when I actually order the nifty fifty.  I guess I felt I wanted some range, so I went with the kit.I am going to pick up the nifty fifty to see what this camera can really do.  I'm pumped about the hobby and so far so good.  I think I'd be even more excited if I had better glass on the cam.  But I'm still learning.  Maybe the kit lens isn't all that bad and its the photographer.The only bad thing about this hobby though is that initially, I thought I would be happy with the body + kit lens.

I've been using non-DSLRs for four years, and have owned 5 of these.  All of the others allow more consistent results than the XT.  However, I am relearning my old SLR ways (the hard way). I LOVE the viewfinder and the speed!  The housing looks good, but scratches easily.  As with all DSLRs, it is exceptionally easy to get dust on the CMOS sensor (and difficult to clean).  Sure wish they'd fix this (couldn't they put a charge on the sensor to repel rather than attract dust?)!

I purchased a Konica Minolta Dimage A200 ( which I use as a secondary camera ) but is a bit to slow for my taste even though it takes amazing pictures. Honestly, Canon's agressive marketing technique was one of the major factors in my desition as far as purchasing the camera or at least looking into it; the camera was displayed every where from Dubai to Europe to Asia to New York, so I started looking into it. The reviews were great and when I was finally able to get my hands on one at a camera store, I just fell in love with it, shorty after I purchased the camera, and have no regrets, especially after understanding all the menus and functions of it, I have become more of a photographer than I ever though I would be.

The Canon Digital Rebel XT was my choice as I have always been satisfied with Canon and the quality of their cameras. The camera is aimed at the serious amateur photographer, and priced at under $1000. So onto my impressions of it.The first thoughts on the camera after opening its box is the size, it is one of the more compact SLRs on the market. Some may dislike this, but for me it is a positive feature of the camera. The aesthetics of the camera are good; I choose the model with the silver body. The first minus is the lack of a supplied compact flash card. Canon are a little mean in this regard, and even with their point-and-shoot digital cameras only supply a small (32 MB or so) CF card. I would recommend purchasing at least 1 GB CF card for this camera. For the price Canon really should try and do better. The rest of the review is very positive. Computer support is good (Mac and PC) with the bundled CD applications, though it isn't good enough to tempt me away from Editing in Photoshop. The camera interface is straight forward, and the auto-focus will allow many to use this camera and produce great quality images without the need to change the settings. AT 8 MP, image quality and definition are very high. The manual and supporting documentation is very good and detailed, so without too much effort you can easily learn how to adjust the image settings to produce exactly the picture you wish. The user-interface and LCD is good and easy to work with, and I find Battery life is good.All-in-all an excellent package. One of the best SLR cameras of its type on the market, and you don't have to be a \"pro\" to take excellent pictures with it. If you don't have one then definitely order a case for the camera, a good quality photo printer, and longer term you will probably want to invest in a tripod and extra lenses.

Focusing is done in a snap (and so far I haven't taken the camera outside from the dusk of my flat to see how it performs in better lighting).

I had been using point-and-shoot's for years and I wanted to get into amateur photography. I had considered older Canon and Nikon models such as the D70 but ultimately I went for the Canon because of the lower price. I bought it with a 28-80mm lens and some basic accessories.First off, the camera is LIGHT. That could be a good or bad thing, depending on your experience holding dSLRs and the size of your hands. Some people have mentioned the rattling sound the pop-up flash makes, and I warn you it is present. That being said, I have zero gripes about the build quality and durability of this camera. It has survived countless drops, the worst outcome being merely a few scratches. It's build should be sufficient for almost everybody. If you want a more solid-feeling camera, get the 20D, a Nikon, or buy a battery grip.I like both the silver and black models, although I went for the black, both models are identical. The black looks more like a typical dSLR, and the silver, while may looking cheap to some, nonetheless looks unique and provides a neat color contrasts to your accessories.The interface on this camera is straightforward, and previous Canon users will recognize its familiar mode dial and status bar above the LCD screen. It has a good setup of features that. Both autofocus and manual focus work perfectly as expected. Just a reminder for people still using point-and-shoot cameras, you cannot preview your pictures using the LCD screen. The knobs for adjusting shutter speed and aperture are easily acceptable, and there are no complaints on the grip and feel of the camera.Picture quality is excellent, whether shooting RAW or JPEG. Its 8 Megapixels should satisfy all but the pickiest detail photographers and the people using their cameras to print out large images. The detail is great, focus for single-shot images is consistent. The camera takes great pictures in nearly any environment, and its 3 frames per second burst shot is pretty good as well. Settings for both manual and auto modes should satisfy most, beginners can chose auto and shoot away while pros have plenty of settings to fiddle through. Noise isn't much of a problem, although the ISO range only goes to 1600. The flash is only average, but the rattling seems to bother me more than the risk of overexposure.One minor problem I note is the autofocus for the continuous shots. While taking continuous shots on auto (burst mode, servo AF) the camera doesn't always focus in on the subject; pictures are occasionally blurry and other times it will focus on the wrong thing. I blame this on the age of the sensor. If you want to take many frames per second for moving targets (sports, etc.) you might want to consider a newer camera with more autofocus points.The software is easy to use, it works with no issue on either Windows or Mac OSX.The startup and write times are speedy: it starts up almost instantly and writing times are immediate (except when taking several frames). I consider this a major upgrade to older dSLRs.The battery life is good, nothing to brag about but it should last you a week on little usage or 3 days of continuous shooting.Note the LCD is very small for a dSLR. It's still very functional, however I find myself squinting to see it in sunlight.There is no video or 'movie' feature on this camera. It's all about the pictures here :)So my few final complaints are (in order): rattling noise caused by flash mounts, continuous autofocus, and LCD screen size and brightness.Is it still a good buy in 2014? Should I consider a newer camera considering its age (2005)? Will it satisfy beginners to photography who are on a tight budget?Here's the answer: as far as buys go, this could be among the best buys for an entry-level dSLR around. For what you get in image quality and flexibility, it is certainly still up for the task for photography. Newer cameras may have blings such as 1080p video, larger displays and more intuitive controls, and more megapixels, but this Canon EOS 350D is a good example of what the heart of beginner and amateur photography should be. If you just want to takes pictures, good pictures, by all means go for it. This isn't a professional camera that shoots in 10 frames per second, and this isn't a camera with 20 megapixels and a 4 inch display. But for what it gives me as an amateur photographer, it gets an easy 5 stars.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Photography Class", "Author": "David Stambol", "ReviewID": "R2596PV8EDK9HR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just what the doctor ordered for my daughter taking a photography class!

Actually, it's still my only SLR camera, but I'm ready to purchase a newer model after having used this one for about 5 years.  I loved this one so much that I thought I should comment on it first.This camera is very easy to use.  It looked a little intimidating at first, but after I spent some quality time with the camera and the manual, I realized that it wasn't difficult to use after all.  It does take practice to make the most of the features offered with this camera, but it's hard not to take a great picture with this camera. The lens that comes with it is a great general purpose lens, but be warned that additional lenses can be addictive!It's a small camera that is easy to hold and balance. It's not very heavy, either, so it's easy to handle when I have to get in awkward positions to get a good shot.If you are a novice considering a high quality digital SLR camera, I highly recommend Canon.  It's not just for pros or experienced photographers.  The Canon Rebel has a huge following and there's an amazing amount of support available to help you get started and achieve the results you are after.  The internet is filled with tutorials and community forums with free advice from users who love to share their knowledge of this camera.

This was my first true SLR, and I've taken it many places and taken many pictures with it while learning how to really take pictures versus just pointing and shooting. I will admit that I haven't become familiar shooting with any other SLRs and I don't have much to compare it to, but with that in mind, it's a great camera. If you are looking to become more serious about your photography and want to concentrate on shutter speed, aperture, manual mode, anything besides switching it to auto and shooting away then this is perfect (although you can still put it in auto.) You can swap out the lenses, and it has many shooting modes and options. It's an older camera, and my smart phone has more megapixels than this camera. That being said, this camera still has a good processor and all of the other internal parts to make these shots ten times better than anything that would come from even the best cell phone. The only reason I'm even considering upgrading to the T3 is because the xT does not have live view, has a smaller display, uses a CF card, doesn't shoot HD video and has less focus zones and less megapixels. The only reason I haven't switched is because the quality on this still very good and I haven't had any problems with this camera, so I can't justify spending the money right now. My recommendation? Some reasons to get this camera are if you have never owned an SLR before, if you're on a lower budget, you want a nice camera but know you'll never use it except for Christmas morning and whatever graduations and family barbecues you have each year, and/or you are a new photographer. Reasons you might not want to get this are if you can't live without live view (seeing what your camera sees on the screen almost like a video), if you have a need to take videos with your camera, and/or if you're you're not a beginner and you're willing to put a little more money into it.

However, I was recently performing some lens sharpness testing, and in the middle of it, my mirror lock-up feature stopped working:  it would not record an image at all while that custom function was enabled.  I called Canon's technical support number, and the guy on their end was very friendly and we tried resetting the camera to its default settings and custom functions.  When this failed to work, he gave me the address to return it for repairs, not really mentioning that because I was out of warranty that this wouldn't be a cheap expenditure.  I'm sure he couldn't really speculate as to how much since he didn't know the problem, but a heads up of the possibility would have been nice.  Instead, I got an email notification of the repairs estimate, and it was $210!!!!!  Not too much shy of what a person might buy a used or rebuilt camera for on here.  For $50, a person can get an extended warranty from Canon for an additional 4 years.  I think that would be well worth it, since you know you will pay significantly more than that in repair costs if and when your camera goes south.  Something to think seriously about, because it is an electronic item, and the standard warranty of a year doesn't get you very far.  I would have to say that I think Canon's repair charges are a bit steep though given the total worth of such a camera.

Canon's kit lens gets 1-star for destroying the whole experience. The combination is worse than just about any modest point-n-shoot. The upshot ... most buyers who are the slightest bit picky will discover the cost of the kit is a lot more than it appears.Unless you are not going to be very picky, ditch the kit and research the cost of replacement lenses, first. Start with Canon's professional 'L' and consumer EF-S just to get the PUCKERING over with.  Then, take heart.While many will offer Sigma, I like Tamron lensing made for Canon EOS bodies.  For starters, Tamron offers a 6-year new warranty, the best I've seen (NOT honored on gray market copies) and it just seems their lenses get, copy for copy, a tad better nod with a slightly higher price. Ideas include Tamron's basic 18-200mm, improved 18-250mm and the too-new-for-review 28-300mm with optical stabilization ... all of them a one-lens-does all idea ranging from $350 to $600 new, roundhouse.If you are REALLY picky, it's tough to beat the performance combo of a current $400 Tamron 17-50mm (very well rated by pro and consumer) plus a $140 Tamron 70-300mm basic telephoto with macro, a surprisingly good lens for the average person's need. But, don't take my word ... research hard and find your own gems.What you get with the kit is a faster, more capable camera with sorely degraded optics.

It was a bowling alley, lower light with action so that made a difference.  Also, I have had situations where I would like a shot with no flash, but I can't avoid blur.  I switched to manual and seemed to get what I wanted, but the auto focus almost always forces a flash in most any lighting situation!  ERRRR!  I am going to switch to the lens with my old camera and hope this helps.  This is still the best deal you will find if you are desperate for a digital SLR like I was.

Even the \"large JPEG\" mode is great for smaller prints like 4x6/5x7 prints.What this camera's low price allows you to do is spend more money to get the good lenses and other equipment that you will use well beyond the life of one camera (hopefully).  Yes, the APS-C sized sensor creates that 'crop factor' but it is workable and there is a wide range of compatible lenses designed for Canon's EOS line.  In addition, I would recommend picking up the 430EX flash, as your indoor photography will greatly improve with something better than the pop-up flash.I have been very satisfied with the results and it is a great way to get started in DSLR photography, which is a different experience from point and shoot cameras.  If you are unsure about what your shooting demands are, or whether you even want to pursue photography more as a hobby, the Rebel XT is great camera.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "One of the best entry level DSLRs", "Author": "Nuknuk", "ReviewID": "R28JCC96NDZQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this as my primary still camera for the last several years. At that time, it was the best selling entry level digital SLR camera. A sub-500$ with an 8 megapixel resolution using the bigger compact flash card. It is an entry level camera but is quite an excellent performer in many levels.It comes with a battery and a very compact charger. It uses Digic II image processor. 7-point AF.Pros:- Very fast start-up time and shutter lag is almost negligible- Image quality is close to the more expensive EOS 20D. Great color rendition and low-noise- Lighter and smaller than its predecessor- Can shoot RAW format- Burst. 14 frames at 3 frames a second- Impressive long battery life.Cons:- Cannot shoot using the LCD panel. You always have to use the viewfinder. LCD is for menu and playback only.- Supplied lens is basic and slow.

Basically this means that the extra card, extra batteries, and battery grip pack I bought won't be sticking around when I upgrade my body again.

You can do as much or as little creatively as you want to with this camera.  The kit lens has been fine for what I use it for (mostly family/baby shots), but the zoom is a little lacking if you're wanting to use it from a distance (such as a sporting event).  It's great if you have young children in the house who don't hold their cute expressions very long.  I took 200 photos in no time, not realizing how many I had and still had plenty of room on the 2GB card.  I've had to recharge the battery twice - using the viewfinder eats the battery up, so I'm weighing the pros and price of a spare, but it only takes an hour or 2 to recharge.  (I did find the battery dead after not using the camera for a couple of days, when previously it had partial charge).  There is a digital battery indicator on the screen, however, it only has two settings - fully charged and \"half\" charged, which can mean \"about to die,\" so if you do imporant shoots on a timetable, I'd have a fully charged spare.  It does take a little longer to load onto the computer compared to my Kodak Easyshare, but it's really not bad - not as bad as I was expecting after reading other reviews.

The original rebel would take a few shots of RAW at 1.5 Frames per second where the rebel XT takes 3 FPS for 6-7 RAW files and of course even more when shooting JPEG.There are alot of features on this camera which are nice to have even if you don't need them.It's a great camera all around.The smaller size is nice too.There are alot of people who say its way to small..I'm 6'4\" and my hands aren't small either. It fits nicely.And with the grip no one can complain.I would recommend getting a wireless remote for the camera also.top lens recommendations for the moneyCanon 18-55 ( not a bad starter lens when stopped down)Canon 70-200 f/4LCanon 17-85 EFS IS USMCS_112 FDT2", "Date": "October 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "CANON REBEL XT", "Author": "G.

I chose up this Canon product for two major reasons, first Nikon D70 was not available at that time and second Digital Rebel XT + lense EF-S17-85mm IS USM seemed to be better and affordable choice. But 2 months and 24 days of use later, I feel very disappointed. When I tried to take pictures of my daughter receiving honors at her \"gala meritas\", the fill-in flash with loud clickety-clack noises refused stubbornly to pop up. It was impossible to take any pictures with flash even after the camera was shut off and reopened again. Each time an error message was appearing up in the viewfinder, blocking completely the use of the camera. And this is not the end of this sad story because Montreal Canon customer service is  very slow to handle up my request of service, at least 4 weeks. And don't try to ask questions to a Canon technician. Only the retailer is able to get a few information and answer you to wait because you don't buy at least a $5000 camera to have the right to get faster service.

The Kiss Digital N is made in Japan and has a few minor differences from the U.S. model.  The kit zoom 18-55 lens for instance is USM.  I bought it as a kit with another Canon lens as well, a 55-200 EF. It's light, cheap, and good enough as I'll get to in a minute. In the end it was between the Pentax istDS or the Digital Rebel XT.  After completing all of my research on-line it came down to Canon picture quality, and technology.  Am I happy?  So far this camera is light years ahead of any digital that I've owned.  It's fast, the pictures are sharp if you understand the limitations of the lens you are using, and it's easy.  My wife can use it just fine and she doesn't have a digital clue.  For the enthusiast, there is plenty of stuff to play with.  The 8 megapixel CMOS sensor produces amazing results.  The soccer pics tell the story for me.  The 55-200 EF produced some incredible shots.  It's USM and focuses fast and sharp.  It's not an \"L\" lens but I don't even know what that means!  This camera will sell like crazy.

All controls are easily accessible so it is easy to switch from 100 to 400 ISO or from flash to no flash or from aperature priority to speed priority. Also, there is vely little delay between shots. My only quarrel with this camera is that the resolution choices do not go low enough. If you know you want to use photos on the Internet, you don't need more than 200 KB; larger resolution settings use up memory space both on the memory card and on the computer and are slow to send with e-mail.

Hoffman", "ReviewID": "R1T2G0VT60DDMS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In response to the post about buying from those 'new & used' sites, BEWARE!  Make sure you do your homework and don't be drawn into something you can't easily undo (even if you're close to NY city they won't provide a real address).  Likewise if you used, as I did, a search to find vendors outside Amazon.My suggestion is to get into Google and look up as much info as you can on a potential storefront or even a user.  Last night I was considering buying from the one offering a Canon 20D for about $750!  After checking them out, I discovered multiple complaints and nothing that indicated they were a legitimiate enterprise.Although I was torn between the XT and the 20D, I decided to place an order with Amazon for the XT.  Now, I notice a post that says his delivery date for this item from Amazon is 2 months out!  My order was immediately 'processed' so I can't change it, but you can bet I will do whatever it takes if I have to wait that long.  The 20D was available for immediate shipment, so I may regret not ordering it.I'll update this post to share how this works out...Since my original post, I have sent Amazon 2 messages to try to cancel my Rebel XT order (and then order the 20D).  I have heard nothing back in 2 days.  Note that the Amazon order page for this item says 'you can cancel your order at any time'.  Not true, as mine says it's being processed and no changes can be made.  Yet, it has not actually shipped nor do I expect it to anytime soon.  Ad also says 'first come, first served' 'as soon as it's available'.  So why not let me change my order rather than place it in limbo where I now am stuck with whatever date they decide to ship it?  Not good customer relations!Although I'm a big advocate of Amazon, I feel I'm getting screwed on this transaction.  Hope someone is reading this as well as the 2 inquiries I have made...It's now Friday - 3 days since my order was locked in - and to my surprise the camera has just been shipped!!!  I never received a reply to my customer service inquiries, so I'll now have to be content with this purchase.  I'm sure this will be a great product but I'm still a bit miffed about the lack of flexibility in changing the order.

Small size. I'm [....] years old and it's still slighty \"too\" small (although that is not a problem because I still have no problem gripping it).2. Great for every situation. In the month I've had it, I've done everything from ISO 1600 to ISO 100, used and not used flash, telephoto lens action shots at the race track, wide angle abstract stills, manual & autofocus and it has still exceeded all my expectations.*I'd say I only have 2 very, very minor complaints:1. Slightly heavy (especially with telephoto lens). Now this may not be a problem for adults, but given this is the \"kids\" section I will say that it was a little heavy at first, but I got used to it in 2 or 3 days. If you absolutely can't stand slightly heavy cameras then you may want to settle for a point & shoot or a film SLR (my film SLR is slightly larger but definantly a lot more lightweight). Or you could get a tri-pod. Either way.2. The settings dial is a little TOO shiny. Yes, that doesn't sound like a problem and I didn't think it was either but a few days after recieving it I was out photographing in the backyard and the dial reflected the sunlight in a sort of intensified beam and shined directly into my eye (very bad eye pain for the next 20 minutes). My advice: Avoid looking at the settings dial directy on a sunny day.*Other than that, I would say if you're looking for a camera, I would very, very very higly recommend this one.WM", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Made for Small Hands", "Author": "architect", "ReviewID": "R2774XKBTP2OKX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am an 18 month user of the original digital rebel, and I love it.  I've been looking at the feature upgrades of the XT for some time and finally decided to sell my old camera and buy this one.  After one day of use I sent to back and cancelled selling my old one:Con:This is made for very tiny hands.  I wear a men's medium glove because they are too small for the \"one size fits all\".  I was shocked at how small your hands need to be to comfortably hold the unit.  My wife was equally disappointed.  I tried 2 approaches:It is comfortable with 2 hands.  This is how I shoot when I have my heavy lenses and external flash installed.  However I only sport this at events I know I will shoot a lot.  When I am at home or take the kids out, I want my light lens and shoot with only one hand (corralling the kids with the other).Use one hand.  There are 2 positions this will work, my grip was strong when I slid my thumb far to the left to \"create shorter fingers\" but I found it difficult to press the trigger.  In a normal position my grip was loose and I tended to droop the camera counter-clockwise.Pros:Everything else you've read is true.  The body is slightly more professional, the burst rate is noticeably faster and the buffer is larger.  The higher ISO quality is amazing.  Choosing the ISO/WB is not much more tedious, but I agree that in sunlight this is a chore.  I do also notice the LCD is more blurry since I got used to reading it straight on using the original, you need to hold it at an angle.  The menus are just as intuitive as the original. FEC is a big win.It is clear to me that the original Rebel neutered features via Firmware to upsell the equivalent quality 10D and this time the grip is the incentive to buy the 20D.", "Date": "December 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "the camera was broke when it was sent to me..I", "Author": "Jamara", "ReviewID": "R18HAH5K6D1PO3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it took me six months to get the $247.00 to get it out of the shop...now that it works I am happy with it..If you are going to sell broken equipment say it is broken so people will know it will have to get fixed before use,not just cleaned..thank you for your time", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Seller was very good", "Author": "Donald B.

That may not seem anything new to SLR folks but the P&S; crowd has been buying gazillion-MP $500+ digicams with crappy fixed lens.4. Large image sensor compared to 7MP Sony's or other XMP digicams. Gives you better picture quality and colors.5. Priced right, unlike some overpriced D-SLR out there, probably because Canon sells many more units.6. The menu on the Canon cameras is light years ahead of most other manufacturer's. Lots of manual options and image processing features.7. LCD screen is bright and fluid, although it doesn't use any new technology like OLED etc.8. Uses standard CF cards, unlike propretary memory cards like Memory Stick or xD card. You can buy 1GB for an affordable price.9. Lots of lens & accessory options from Canon and other vendors.Con's,1. The camera is still quite heavy and big. I guess that will remain so for most D-SLR's, for a while atleast.2. Not for professional use, only prosumer quality.3. Quite an expensive camera, out of reach of most people (unlike film SLR's). When other manufacturer's get it right, the price should fall significantly.4. LCD screen could have been bigger for such a bulky camera.5. Wish they come up with a way to show approximate picture for framing on LCD before shooting. Viewfinder is too cumbersome & old fashioned.I am almost sure Rebel XT will be THE best selling D-SLR of 2005, just like original Rebel in 2004.

Nienhuis", "ReviewID": "R3MS2XS6V5Q6SO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "About four months ago I purchased the Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera. Additionally I bought two professional zoom lenses. The basic EF-S 18-55mm that came with the camera was not sufficient for me to fully utilize the camera. After the first time use I noticed a stain on the pictures. Changing different lenses can cause dust in the sensor area. The instructions for use suggested the sensor cleaning procedure.  So I did but the stain did not go away. Furthermore the stain did not seem to be dust but an oil stain of some sort. I contacted the Canon service department and they told me that sensor cleaning warranty was only within the first six months after the date of purchase. I decided not to mail the camera but bring the camera myself to a Canon service centre. At the Canon service centre I learned how to clean the sensor myself but I also learned that my little stain was a serious problem. Somehow during the manufacturing process an oil stain accumulated between the filter and the sensor. Thus the camera had to stay at the Canon service centre and would be mailed to me after it was repaired. The Canon service centre promised to prioritize the repair. After one week I received a box in the mail and I was surprised that expensive and sensitive SLR cameras were shipped in tinny single layer boxes. My surprise was even bigger when I discovered that my camera was not even in the box. The Canon service centre has send me a Powershot instead that belonged to another customer. What happened to my SLR camera is a mystery and I am still waiting to receive a new camera. My recommendation do not buy this end-of live Canon Digital Rebel XT8MP until Canon takes more care in customer service and in particular in case warranty is claimed.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "I SHOT TWO FORMER PRESIDENTS!!!", "Author": "David J.

I had a Powershot Pro1 and I thought the Rebel XT was going to be an upgrade from the Pro1. So far I have taken over two hundred pictures, side by side, using both the XT and the Pro1. For each picture I used the same settings within the choosable range for both cameras. I have taken pictures in the evening, in the night when the light is very dim, and in a sunny morning in the outside. I set the focal length at 200 mm on the Pro1 and 130 mm on the XT, which were almost exactly equivalent. After I took the pictures I came inside and open them with Microsoft Digital Image Pro to compare side by side the pictures of the same objects taken by the two cameras. Without fail, when auto focus was used for both cameras, the Pro1 produced much sharper images and a much better depth of field. When I switched to manual focus, though, the XT did produce razor sharp image with full details. I am impressed with the speed of the Rebel XT as compared to the Pro1. But I do not want to focus manually all the time. My decision is to stick with my Pro1 and return the XT tomorrow.  One word to the Canon engineers, finally.

It's trying to be too many things to too many levels of photographer.  Canon is clearly going for the consumer/semi-professional/professional market.  In my opinion it turns a potentially great camera into an expensive gadget.  Too many features, too many menu options, too many automatic modes--in short, too much of everything.  Imagine buying a car that has manual AND automatic transmission and is a combination hard-top/rag-top convertible with disc and drum brakes front and back, an AM/FM radio, CD player, cassette player, 8-track tape player, reel-to-reel player, record player, and a 16-track digital recording studio.  \"Cool!\" you say?  Buy this camera right now.  I'm looking for a good quality DSLR to replace my standard SLR.  This camera has way too many gee-whiz features designed to appeal to the consumer market.  It makes it a pain in the arse to use--unless you want those features, of course.  I don't.2). You can't use the display as a viewfinder.  This is a huge deal-killer, in my opinion.  One of the great advantages of a digital camera is the ability to use the onscreen display for setting up your shots.  I understand they're trying to maximize battery life, but a digital camera where you CAN NOT use the display while you're shooting is absurd.3). Terrible macro mode.  Not just average.  Terrible.  You definitely need an optional macro lens in order to take decent macro photos with this camera.  Otherwise, you're going to be stuck with Canon's bizarre decision to force the use of flash in macro mode (you get to choose between no flash mode or macro mode in the auto settings (but not both(?)) or manual mode with an optional lens).  Buying a closeup lens for a high-end camera is reasonable to expect, I suppose, except that I've never run into this problem with ANY other digital camera I've used.  Most are great for quick-and-dirty macro photography right out of the box.4). The dumbest manual white-balance procedure I've ever seen in my life.  Use it.  I dare you.5). Incredibly lousy manual.  Standard feature for ALL cameras these days, I know.  Doesn't excuse the fact, however.Don't get me wrong, this is a GREAT camera that takes excellent pictures and works as advertised.  It just not anywhere close to what I was looking for.  Canon could have skipped 80% of the features and simplified a few others and I would have kept this camera.

First of all, the camera quickly got a small amount of dust on the sensor (even without removing the lens) and ruined most of my pictures.  I could remove it with Photoshop, but I don't want to go through that for the nearly 2000 pics that I took.Additionally, the color was horrible.  I get better color from my Canon s400 elph.  I tried using AV,Program mode, manual, landscape....all of them were problematic.  Also, many of the pics were washed out.The main problem is the stock lens that comes with the camera.  it is a very slow f3.5 lens.  junk.  buying a faster lens adds another grand to the total price.other sources of irritation:  cannot use lcd screen to take pics.  results in using the viewfinder and your nose squished up against the lcd screen.I am returning this tomorrow.", "Date": "March 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "Read the reviews and not just the overall rating!!!", "Author": "A.

A year ago I could have recommended this camera, but it's already succeeded by the Rebel XTi. Not only that, If dust were to get into your camera, you are doomed, as the XTi has a self cleaning sensor unit that shakes off dust. Any dust that adhered to the sensor can be removed with the bundled software. It also has a higher resolution sensor, although there is no real difference. In fact, the XT may have better pixel detail than the XTi. But if you want to look for a new DSLR, try a 10 MP XTi, Sony a100, or Nikon D80. Many critics would choose the Nikon, but I would choose Canon's XTi. There is only 7-point  AF, while the XTi has 9-point AF. I don't really care if you can shoot 3  FPS on both cameras or even 5 FPS like the 30D because you can't get light into the camera and it only works under super bright conditions. The only good thing is the price, which is cheaper than the XTi, but still not worth it.Quality: 2/10 (1/5)Lower resolution than XTi. If dust gets into the camera, your doomed.Value: 4/10 (2/5)Few hundred dollars cheaper than XTi, but still no worth it.
