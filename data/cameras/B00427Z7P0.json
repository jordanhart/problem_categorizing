I even called Pentax here in Golden Colorado. USA and asked them when is the KR coming out?, Yeah,  i sold my Sony 700 DSLR gear and replaced with KR. I bought a Tamron 70-200mm F2.8 for it, as expected KR is a small and compact body which i like, simple design, easy to use, tons of features, nice neck strap, i wish they make a battery grip for it, but not...Ok, so i tested it out with about 400 shots in all settings, especially on high Iso and watch for noise, here are the samples, the shots w/o flash was shot at 12,800 ISO[...]And here with 800 Iso[...]Pictures speak for itself, i really like the IQ, high iso with low noise and it is well control, not as nasty noise as some other cameras brand( no name), i like the DNR and smooth details low noise, true colors, sharpness and easy to use, fast shooting 7fps..For the price  you just can not beat it...Sorry Sony but i have found a new buddy.Cheers.JV", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.95", "Features": "12.4-megapixel CMOS sensor; compact, lightweight body\nBody only; lenses sold separately\nWidescreen 720p HD video at 25fps; powerful automatic shooting modes including Pentax Auto Picture\n3-inch LCD with 921,000 dots of resolution; wide range of in-camera image processing and special effects filters\nCapture images and video to SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Pentax K-r 12.4 MP Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (White Body)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hDLSncUyL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00427Z7P0"}}
