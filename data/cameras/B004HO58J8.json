{"Reviews": [{"Title": "At this price, with AA batteries and HD video, you can't quite go wrong", "Author": "Timothy Takemoto", "ReviewID": "RY29BO48NBZBW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because it was the cheapest at my large local Japanese electronics store, it runs on AA batteries, and as well as loads of pixels in the still camera mode, it takes high definition videos. High definition videos are important even, or especially, on Youtube to get a crisp result.I tried a competing Canon product, the A495, but it was more plasticy, thicker, the picture quality was no better, and it takes only SD movies.The picture quality is fine. It is easy to use. The AA batteries are brilliant because I can always put in new ones without waiting to charge. The only other way to ensure that your camera is ready is to purchase a spare chargeable and a charger but that puts 30% on the cost of the camera.My more expensive cameras (Canon D40, Sanyo Xacti HD2000) are both in for repair. I needed a stop-gap camera. And at this price you can't go wrong, quite.The only problems are it is a little slow between photos (the time taken to save the last photo before allowing the next one to be taken is about a second or so and very far from instantaneous), and when strongly over exposed there are purple lines below and above the over exposed portion of the photo. That may be a problem of the particular camera that I have, which was an ex-display model. It is not that thin - like more expensive models - but who wants really thin? The bulbous right hand side, that contains the AA batteries, allows for a grip. The zoom isn't much at three times, but I hate zooming anyway. There is no way to switch between movie and still camera mode wihtout using a menu. I would have prefered a switch.Recommended camera.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Owners, Check For This Problem!", "Author": "Vivid", "ReviewID": "R23VKMHDOWZKQT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Decent camera with good features and price. However Folks (especially if you own this), mine had a major defect that does NOT seem to be an isolated case. When shooting video at 640 resolution, the audio and video will go severely out of sync and start to phase and echo in really weird ways at about 1:15 minutes (does NOT happen at 720 res). I repeatedly tested this to make sure it was not a one time accident, and the weird sync echo phasing problem happened every time, and will show on both the camera playback, and as an uploaded video on your computer. Coincidentally, one day while looking at video tests of this camera on YouTube, I found 2 comments stating this very same problem, so it is NOT isolated and perhaps deserves a recall. I suspect that most people who own this will shoot video at the max 720 resolution, so they may not be aware of this defect. I encourage owners to test this and will be curious to see the results. Luckily I discovered this defect before the Amazon return period expired and got a refund. It's a shame, because otherwise, it would be a pretty good deal.
