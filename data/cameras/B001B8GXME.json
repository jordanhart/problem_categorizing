{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Point and Shoot Camera", "Author": "JBebe", "ReviewID": "RNFK9HZINJA6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about a year and a half ago and I have loved it. It takes great pictures (I am sure the newer models with more megapixels are even better) and has a lot of different settings.This camera takes videos with great sound and can also record sound all by itself. You can also record a sound clip to go with a photo. It zooms in pretty far and takes pretty good pictures even when it is all the way zoomed in.I use lithium batteries and they last a long time in this camera - and I take pictures EVERY DAY. I have taken thousands and thousands of pictures with this camera and it is still working really well.The only problem I have had is that lately when the battery runs out, the camera shuts off and the lens won't retract back into the camera until I put new batteries in.This is a great camera, and I love it because it is red! It is very cute.", "Date": "October 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "seller information", "Author": "R.

However, I have contacted this seller twice to get information on his return policy and what exactly it means to have a \"refurbished\" camera.  He has not responded and this concerns me. So, sadly I won't be purchasing this camera.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Samsung S630 6 MP 3x Optical/5x Digital Zoom Camera General Features: Color: Red 6 Mega pixel\nLens Type: 1/25-inch CCD 2.5-inch color TFT LCD 3x Optical Zoom 5x Digital Zoom TTL auto focus\nMechanical and Electronic shutter Shutter Speed: 1 ~ 1/1,500 sec.(Manual : 8 ~ 1/1,500 sec.)\nExposure Control: Program AE; Metering : Multi, Spot\nFlash Modes: Auto, Auto Red-eye reduction, Fill-in flash, Slow sync, Flash off", "Name": "Samsung S630 6MP 3x Optical/5x Digital Zoom Camera (Red)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51723ps9fUL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001B8GXME"}}
