This is my latest camera chosen because of the speed or interval between shots is really fast. There is a burst mode as well as the traditional feature of 3 timer shots which is helpful when trying to catch children with their eyes open. I wish there was an optical viewfinder ( Casio used to make one) but all compact cameras have abandoned the optical in lies of a larger LCD screen. So far I am really pleased with this Casio.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect and Easy", "Author": "L.

I immediately found the new version of my old beloved Casio and haven't looked back. The shutter speed it remarkably fast for a point and shoot and with so many options!
