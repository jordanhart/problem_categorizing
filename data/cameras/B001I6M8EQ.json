For that, it's been pretty good.I thought I gave it three stars, but see that two are there and I am unable to change that.The cons:--It doesn't perform terribly well in low-light, but neither did I expect it to.--It has problems focusing, seemingly for no reason, and so the results I've gotten have been somewhat inconsistent as far as blurriness goes.--There are no manual overrides, outside of controlling the flash, but sub-compact cameras were not designed for that.--It has a rechargeable battery, which is consistent with cameras of this size, so you always have to make sure you are charged up if you need the camera for a big event.--There can be some inexplicable color artifacts in some of the photos,even when there is plenty of light.--It's not the speediest camera.--It doesn't upload all of the photos into iPhoto (skips quite a bit of them), nor does it indicate which of the uploaded items are movies. I haven't figured out why but, because of this, you have to be careful and make sure all of the photos have been captures before deleting them from the camera. It could be that Olympus is just not as Mac-friendly as my Canons have been.The pros:--There are some nice, usable scene modes, which are helpful.--It has an anti-shake feature.--The movie mode is fairly decent, although there is no ability to zoom.--It is teeny,tiny and very lightweight, and can go anywhere.--The photos are generally pretty good for most uses, sometimes surprisingly so (which is unfortunately not consistent).", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excelent value for money", "Author": "Oscar Pachano", "ReviewID": "R2ZNMKL4ZR9JLY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera, light and small with excellent resolution.a good value for money, I've never used an olympus camera before..", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "good experience usuing it", "Author": "D.
