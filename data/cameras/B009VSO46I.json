Winkler", "ReviewID": "R31W9ETK8O49Z8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have other digital cameras but I wanted one with slow motion ability. For the cost of this camera: I am truly amazed at the quality at 120fps, 240fps, and even at 1000fps. It does take about 40mb for each second of slow motion video, but for my needs, that's fine. The quality is really good, easy to use, and regular photos and HD video is also better than I expected. Definitely a camera I would recommend to others.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Casio EX-ZR1000 Digiatal Camera", "Author": "Al Hunter \"Al  Hunter\"", "ReviewID": "R2YLMU2AYC1YJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A fine camera, compact, and easy to use. Offering what I felt was the best of both worlds, small & light-weight, while at the same time incorporating a mega 12.5 optical zoom, and 16.1 megapixel capability which can also shoot slow motion up to a 1000 fps, Wow!.I was overly surprised at how I was able to enhance the subject matter which had been barely viewable at over a half mile distance into a photograph thought to have been taken within just feet away. Amazing! I must admit the camera can be a bit much with all the various features and options, but this is offset by the means of pre-setting the camera functions to automatic which helps serve to acquire much of what you would expect from that great camera you were looking for.Having said all that, I sure wish they would have thought to provided a viewfinder in addition to the adjustable 3\" LCD, as viewing your subject matter when outdoors in bright sunlight can become difficult if not impossible, an issue however I have found with most point and shoot camera's. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this product.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very cool and works great", "Author": "amazon fan", "ReviewID": "R32UMS08WUQTO8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave this to my photobug son and he has been amazed at the capabilites of this tiny camera.

I believe the default language is in Chinese, however there is an option to change it into English. I'm very happy with this camera, the only con is that the maximum recording time is in 30min intervals!! As another poster already have mentioned, video recording drains a lot of the battery as well.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Casio delivers again!!!", "Author": "curlyNoodles", "ReviewID": "R33EQK30OZ17DA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great high speed camera!!! Unit I bought was in Japanese characters but I was able to change settings to English without any difficulty at all using the manual that was listed off Casio's website.  The only drawback and big disappointment is that the camera I received was made in China and not in Japan as I thought it would be since vendor is listed as from Japan. Hopefully camera lasts!!!  This model (ZR 1000) aside from being fast offers so many features and one that I am fond of is its ability switch to fisheye-lens mode.

I did find an english manual online and found out how to change it to english, but what a waste of my time. Also I found out after the fact that the warranty is only good in Japan. Had I been informed of all of this prior to buying, I would have kept looking. Amazon said I could return it, but repacking is a hassle and I had immediate need of its high speed video capabilities.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well made, decent camera- not a great high speed diagnostic tool", "Author": "Jim Abitabilo", "ReviewID": "R3DULSTT4IHQG6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera is marketed as high speed, with time stamping. Performs the video function well enough at different frame rates but the time stamp does not match any time base that made sense. Files taken at higher frame rates were automatically exported in slow motion, so figuring out the real speed was near impossible. I resorted to filming stopwatches and the second hand on the clock to figure it out. Also, there seemed to be no way to play back a single frame at a time, regardless of how videos were viewed. User instructions were either inadequate, or the camera lacked the capabilities I expected - it was hard to discern which was the case.Call to customer service proved fruitless. The representative never understood the technical issues I was trying to resolve. She said they would have a technical representative get back to me with a solution. 3 weeks later, no return call or info.Cute camera to play with, some nice features, but not the best high speed diagnostic tool.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really?  No English manual.", "Author": "Sir Buck", "ReviewID": "R2JWYPQ2GKMZ0E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera arrived with one and only one manual and it is written in Chinese.I like this camera, but now I know I bought a Grey Market camera and I advise you to find an Open Market seller that has cameras intended to be sold in the USA that have English Manuals. Stay away from this seller.I contacted the seller, \"FROM.JAPAN\", and I will paraphrase their response, \"SORRY ABOUT THAT, YOU GET WHAT I GIVE YOU\". They stated that the reason the camera does not come with an English manual is because the camera is made in Japan. How stupid do they think their customers are?The only way you will get a manual is to download the PDF. It sure would be nice to have a nice small OEM manual that I can carry with the camera. The camera has so many features that I would say it is not easy for the average person to remember how all the bells and whistles work from memory so it would be nice to have the written reference.I looked over the Amazon page where this camera is advertised and I did not find anything that would tell me beforehand that I was not going to get an English manual with the camera.26.AUG.2013  The reason I bought this camera is because of the high fps video capabilities.  I used it at work today to video a machine that moves so fast we cannot watch it and troubleshoot it.  With the 480 fps video we were able to see exactly what our eyes could not see.  The camera is a good camera, but I am still PO'ed at the seller.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "john c rhines", "ReviewID": "R25I09Q132Q2BO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sooo many features, download the 200+ page pdf manual before you buy to explore this device.
