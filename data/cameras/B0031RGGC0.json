Roberts", "ReviewID": "RNX6BGBMCN5LB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I have tried various cameras, but nearly all of them result in photos where her eyes are closed. It became a bit of a family joke, but it's actually very frustrating. Several years ago her sister bought a Kodak camera and the photos were terrific, so we bought a Kodak V603 and loved it. No more closed eyes, wonderful colors, great Schneider lens, and it had a nifty little video camera included, was compact, etc. It just recently broke, so we were in the market for a new camera. Luckily, Kodak was just about to release this 580, also with a Schneider lens.The camera arrived today, is still compact (though a little bigger than our V603), has a much larger viewing screen, and easy to use buttons. The first few photos resulted in her eyes partially closed, but once I selected the \"Red-Eye Preflash\" option everything was great. Photo after photo and eyes were wide open and beautiful! We're very pleased.The video looks great and should be just as easy to pull off the camera as in earlier versions. We don't really need the 14 Megapixels (who really does?), but I guess one never knows when we might need to blow up a photo to billboard size. Also, the \"blue\" color is much cooler than expected -- it's really more like a steel blue. The strap took 10 seconds to put on and it took just a few minutes to navigate the directories, set the date & time, and to insert the battery and memory card (memory was purchased separately).I suggest watching the price, because it will undoubtedly drop. Also, each time I checked the listing over the first week of sale the seller changed between Amazon and independent retailers. Something to keep in mind as you calculate shipping and return policies.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak releases a camera when smaller seems better.", "Author": "Sean Clyne", "ReviewID": "RSUQNFH578T7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been spending months looking for a camera with a quality lens that was still pocket size. Most of my prior cameras had Schneider lens and I have been a long time supporter of the Kodak company so the two cameras I finally had to decide between were the z950 and the M580.  I liked the large aperture of these cameras since most people take photos indoors and I couldn't believe you would get the same photo quality on a lens the size of an erasure head. The z950 has a slightly larger lens but it also has a large housing for the camera. it is .4 inches larger in each measurement. In reviews this was a deal-breaker for many other users. I liked the idea of a larger camera but ultimately chose M580.  The time between power up and first shot is quicker. And although I cannot give specifics the burst photography is much more reliable on the M580. The z950 is quicker between photo one and two, but I have found that when you are needing to take a series of photos quickly (i.e. kids are doing something quickly) the photo taken split seconds after the first one contain the same problems as the original picture. The processing screen still shows up after the second photo but it only is there for half of a second before you get the opportunity to click again. The z950 has a 3 second delay. In today's fast paced world that is an eternity.  The last reason I chose the M580 was the button layout. I prefer the zoom buttons on the back of the unit. The dial used in the z950 work better when you have your eye pressed against a view finder. The buttons are more distinct on top of the z950. That being said I have yet to press the wrong button by mistake on the m580.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "This camera is amazing", "Author": "dejenerate \"pizza enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R3W2LIU8XZS5P1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hesitant to buy this camera since there seemed to be very few reviews, and of those there were, half were great and the other half were terrible. Well, I am glad that I bought this camera. I am familiar with Kodak cameras, as my last camera was a Kodak Easyshare V1253. This camera is great! The flash is incredibly strong, and pictures taken come out brilliantly lit, and the colors are amazing. I took a simple picture of my kitchen, and I was amazed at how beautiful the picture looked! I didn't even realize my kitchen looked like that! Really though, I haven't found any problems with this camera yet. The video it takes is nice quality, but the camera's sound itself is quite quiet. That's to say that, when reviewing videos taken, it's hard to hear what I videotaped. BUT, I'm sure the sound will be fine once the video will be played on a computer or such. I don't have anything bad to say about this camera. I love the 8x zoom, the wide angle lens... everything. If you are not sure whether to buy this camera, I would say to definitely at least give it a try. I find going to Best Buy and playing with the cameras VERY helpful. You can hold the camera you might end up buying in your own hands, and play with the settings, and see how the general photo quality is. In conclusion, this camera is great!!", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera Freezes and Pictures are Blurry", "Author": "Jesaro \"Jesaro\"", "ReviewID": "R3JZDMPVVMHDCI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered this camera and was excited when I received it a couple days after its release.  It was out of the box two hours before I started having problems.  When I would use the date stamp feature for my photos, the camera would freeze about every 5th picture and I would have to pull the battery as all the other buttons - including the on/off button - would no longer work.Hoping I could see past this I continued to use it. However, it would sometimes freeze after taking a picture and, like the problem with the date stamping, I would have to pull the battery.  This would also result in the loss of the picture I just took.What finally did it for me was that even with the image stabilization lens, the pictures came out terribly blurry.  This is my sixth Kodak camera and the pictures taken on my 3.1 MP Kodak from 2004 were far better.  I know how to work Kodak cameras and on every setting I tried, the pictures came out blurry.  The Smart Capture feature seems to make the pictures overexposed.  The same picture taken on Smart Capture on my Z950 came out considerably crisper with more true-to-life colors.Due to the freezing and the blurry images, this will be the second Kodak I've ever returned.  It's too bad.  I really wanted to like this camera.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome, simple point and shoot", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R22SSW86YASCUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera and absolutely love it.  The M580 has the best picture quality I've ever had in a digital point and shoot.  This is due to the Schneider lens,  extremely high end lens in a sub-$200 camera, makes for great pics, and this holds through all 8 lenses.  Zoom is a bit extreme, you need to have a steady hand when you're out to 8X, but you get used to it - honestly, would be fine with just a 5X.The Share feature is great, love the expandable memory, and the camera has USB and HDMI built in, along with 720p High Definition Video capability.Expandable card slots are awesome, and the flash is pretty good for a small camera.Best feature to me is the wide angle 28mm lens - great for scenes or for making small stuff look large.  Excellent mode control and great features, very simple to use.I've had the freeze problem very rarely, but this usually comes when I'm slamming through too many commands at once. Easy reset to crack the battery partway out and push it back in.Great Camera!", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sept.2010 firmware update fixes freeze-ups", "Author": "Stephen Fitzgerald", "ReviewID": "R39SK5KPY5VHSO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kodak EasyShare M580 14MP Digital Camera with 8x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 3.0 Inch LCD (Purple)We purchased this camera from a nationally known mega store at a lower price than is now available anywhere. The thing that attracted us was the 8x optical zoom which is twice and then some that of any other camera in this price range $120-$160, which is great for taking Graduation pics.The pictures are clear and in focus and with the 14MP can be zoomed in on and cropped to the specific subject. There was a problem we had with it freezing up when changing modes (example:from pictures to video)when we 1st go it then I found that Kodak had a firmware update that fixed this problem (pay very close attention to the instructions)and since then no more freeze-ups.

I purchased this camera thru a television shopping channel and after the rebate I paid eighty nine dollars, free shipping and four value pays for it.  Not bad!  However, you get what you pay for.  I was simply looking for a quick, cheap, easy, point and shoot with video capability to replace a 3 1/2 year old Sony that takes mostly blurry pictures, freezes on focusing and has a small viewing screen that I paid over two hundred dollars for.  I currently have a DSLR Canon Rebel 450D Xsi that I absolutely LOVE but it's a bit bulky for some occasions.After reading many reviews I have to agree with others, yes, this camera DOES freeze.  I think it mainly happens when I take a picture and my finger presses down on two buttons at the same time since all the buttons on top are right next to each other without any space between them.  When that happens I just open the bottom battery cover, let the battery pop out for a split second, push it back in and close the cover again.  Yes, that's a bit of a pain and I would hate to miss a shot cuz of that but I didn't buy this camera for anything important so it's not a big deal to me.  I just think of the price I paid for it.  And really it's not much different than my Sony freezing having focusing problems and I'm slamming my finger down on the button and the stupid thing won't shoot sometimes causing me to miss a shot anyway.  I'm probably going to buy another new point and shoot in another 2 years when technology advances, etc. anyway.The other thing true about this camera is that it can occasionally take blurry pictures but you know what?  That's with many digital cameras these days, even my DSLR Canon.  All you have to do is breathe while you snap and boom you get a blurry shot.  However, this camera can also take INCREDIBLE pics when the lighting is right, you hold your breath and you get the right angle.  I wouldn't say the pics are as nice as my DSLR but they are pretty nice for an eighty nine dollar camera.  Also, as for pics in the dark, I stood in a dark corner by my house, late at night, and took a picture of a bunch of leaves that I couldn't even tell what color they were in the dark and they came out incredible!!  Also took a picture of the full moon and well, it's not perfectly clear but cuz of the great zoom, it didnt come out half bad.  However if I tried to do that with my old Sony 3x or 4x zoom, the moon would look like a little white spec.The downloading of pics to a computer is a breeze.  I have a 5 year old computer with Windows XP and all I did was plug the camera in and it did its own thing after a click or two.  Then I had the pics in a folder on my computer in a matter of seconds.  I apologize but I have not used the video feature as of yet and was waiting until I recieved my memory card to try that out.Please be advised this camera does not come with a memory card and when you try to take pictures with it out of the box, you can only take up to 17 pics and then you have to download them or erase them to take more.  As for what the max capacity of a memory card you can use, after emailing tech support because I could not find it anywhere in the box, booklet, etc. I found out by the next day via email back that this camera can take up to 32GB SDHC memory card!!!!Many speak of the battery life for this camera or lack thereof.  I find it to use up a little bit more battery life than my DSLR Canon and my Sony.  Not a big deal.  I picked up an additional battery for twenty bucks which you should always do for every camera anyway.So, after reading this, you are thinking to yourself \"should I bother with this camera?\" Well, my answer is yes only for these reasons... 1)if you don't need this camera for anything important,2)you want a knock-around point and shoot, 3)if this is for a youngster (especially for the \"easyshare\" feature to facebook, youtube, etc. and 4)if it's about $100 or less.

The Canon was good but kept complaining that the batteries were dead even if brand new. I also wanted something with more MP and a faster.  Anyway, I charged up the Kodak and used it once.  The next time I tried it the lens would come out half way and it would tell me something like \"Please remove the lens cap\"!  Of course it has no lens cap which I thought was amusing if not annoying.  I let it sit for a day and then tried it again and it seemed fine.  Then it did the lens thing again and was stuck in the out position.  It also would not even power on anymore.  So, I returned it for a refund.

There were a few things I liked about it:1. Records good video with sound during zoom. Many point-and-shoot cameras cut sound out during zoom or cannot zoom at all. You can change the quality from HD to standard, as well. A nice addition.2. Brilliant 14MP quality on subjects about 1-2 meters away.3. Panorama mode. While not a \"sweep panorama\", the 3 picture mode on this model is sufficient and easy to use.4. Can actually switch automatically between macro and auto-focus/infinity based on what you are pointing the camera at.5. Really liked the strong zoom capabilities. Although at full zoom pictures aren't amazing, no camera for less than a thousand bucks can offer that.There were also some things I didn't love:1. Macro mode, in one word or less - HORRIBLE. Taking pictures close-up (and no matter what setting - macro, text, Image Stabilizer, flash/no flash) looks a bit like what things may look like with a blood-alcohol content above .30. It is near impossible to get a solid picture at closer than 6 inches. Flash will \"white-out\" any object, and no flash will cause complete blurriness.2. Ease-of use. While some cameras have a dial to change settings, this one is a single button placed on top of the camera next to the flash. And it is flush with the camera, just like the flash and shutter buttons. For those of you who need something really easy, this isn't the one for you. Although I had no major problems finding anything, I was not impressed by the navigability. Not to mention, every time you turn the camera off and go to use it again, the setting goes back to the default. To get the one you wanted, you have to go through and find it again. And finding scene settings (night portrait, fireworks, snow, etc.) can take a little while.3. Editing ability/red-eye. There aren't any real editing features in-camera like I hoped for. I took several pictures of a friend (trying to dial in the settings) and found that the \"red-eye removal\" feature doesn't always do its job. You can set it to pre-flash or digital correction. While I had more luck with digital correction, red-eye was still sometimes a problem, and unlike my ancient Samsung SL310, you cannot enter the picture in the camera and remove it.The ugly:You've either read about it before or will read about it after this....FREEZE!Like the majority of other reviewers, I also was the victim of the camera's meaningless tendency to suddenly and inexplicably quit working. As I was thumbing through some pictures I had taken and decided that I was actually liking the camera, the screen went totally black. The camera stayed on, soI had to remove the battery and put it back in just to get the thing to turn off. It happened a second time shortly after the first. I had taken no more that 25 or 30 pictures in a two-hour period and already had a big issue. Others mention that the battery takes too long to charge, but since I returned the camera immediately after the second time it froze, I cannot comment on that. I did initially charge the battery after I checked the level, which was about half strength, and it seemed to charge at a normal pace. But a brand new camera should not have a problem like the one I (and many others) experienced. There is a reason that the word \"freezing\" is in the tags at the bottom of the review screen.I can't say I loved the camera but I also didn't hate it.  I have operated worse in the same price range, but also some that were/are far better. As far as a recommendation, all I can say is proceed with caution.

I think that 1) they are being rushed to market without proper testing; 2)these devices are like primitive computers that are being asked to perform complex functions; and 3)they are manufactured in or parts are sourced from a certain country with little regard for quality control- not their fault, but the corporate, bottom line mentality that sent our jobs elsewhere.

You can even zoom in and out while your filming. It's very easy to use and so simple. The M580 uses it's own battery and charges in about an hour or two for me. The LCD screen is very bright and can be turned down to save battery life if you want. It's such a great camera to own and will for sure bring you lots of joy. I've only had it a few weeks and have had a blast using it. The Kodak software is pretty easy to use as well. You don't even need a cd, you just plug it into your computer with the usb cable.

I took many pics out hiking with it last summer and got many, many compliments on the quality.But it is only 4 mp, so I've been wanting to upgrade. And I wanted another Kodak.(My kids have had other brands including 2 Sony's that gave out after a year). I knew from my 6440, the lens really does make a difference, and it has the Schneider Kreuznach Veriagon lens. The M580 has the Schneider Kreuznach lens, and combined with the sale price decided to go for it, despite mixed reviews. Over all I like it. I can't seem to get the brackets to center on faces as it should, but that doesn't seem to make any difference in picture quality. My pics are sharp and clear. So far most my pics are my dog, and a couple shots out walking along the Rims this spring, but they all have a very nice quality. I'm looking forward to taking it hiking with me and see how it does. Although I might get the Z981 or Max for that.I did have the freeze problem once, and like other's had to take the battery out. I haven't had it since.I would recommend this camera for someone who cares about picture quality, and easy use. I haven't been disappointed by Kodak yet.***Update***I had some frustrations with this as I used it with the settings, and picture crispness---and purchased a Nikon L120 for hiking and vacations. I did play with a couple things, the ISO, reset it to infinity etc, and am much happier with it---although it seems to reset somethings as soon as it's turned off. In spite of my frustration (I'm so not techy to begin with) with the settings & menu, I really would still recommend this camera & I still think it deserves a 4, not a 5 because the menu is a bit of a challenge. I think I'll like it quite a bit for less formal pics, and all around picture taking.***UPdate*** Overall I'm satisfied with this camera, and use it quite a bit for casual pictures. I used it a lot on my grandkids. It does take very clear and bright casual pics. And action shots are pretty impressive just on auto, catching water drops splashing as the girls were swimming & the video is surprisingly good.

The sound is very sensitive and picks up all the action. And you can't really appreciate the quality of the pictures until you connect your camera to a big screen HD TV. The quality is stunning. And another great feature is the battery charging system. It charges from a USB port on your laptop or through an electrical outlet. And if you're near an electrical outlet when you're shooting video, you can just plug it in and not even use the batteries. The few draw backs I've experienced are the buttons are too small for my big fingers and I'm not a big fan of the video \"mov\" format. Several of the better movie processing software programs will not recognize and you must convert to another format.Now then, to the Kodak misrepresentation in their ads. Even though the Kodak ad says it does...even though the Kodak online manual shows you how to cut it on and off...this camera does NOT have the \"Image Stabilization\" that is advertised. One Kodak agent told me when you depress the shutter button 1/2 way that activates the \"Image Stabilization.\" I said great, now what about shooting videos? I talked to several tech support agents concerning this and they all tried to take me to the place on the camera to set \"Image Stabilization.\" It is NOT there. I might also mention that to deal with Kodak tech support...you will need to be multilingual and don't waste your time asking for the location or phone number of their main American headquarters, because that must be a well guarded company secret they're not allowed to share.In my search for the ever elusive \"Image Stabilization\" features on my camera, \"Polly R.\" of Kodak tech support was kind enough to inform me by email:\"Thank you for contacting Kodak Technical Support.We understand that you would like to know how to set the Image Stabilization feature of your Kodak EasyShare M580 digital camera.We appreciate the chance to be of assistance.Upon checking the setting of the M580, the setting is not available on the camera. The feature can be automatically activated when you press the shutter button halfway to focus and set exposure. You will see green framing mark when the picture is stabilized.We would like to thank you for bringing this to our attention, rest assured this will be forwarded to proper department.\"Would I buy the Kodak M580 camera again? By all means. It is one of the finest cameras for under a hundred dollars with many great features and the pictures and videos are so incredible...you don't even miss the lack of image stabilization!

I had read some mixed reviews on the camera but purchased it anyway thinking I'd take a chance and I really wish I didn't. My parents have had problems with this camera from early on, almost right out of the box....sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. There are problems with it turning on as well as with the lense opening and closing (getting stuck when it's out, etc). When it does work, the pictures are not even clear and often come out blurry. I would not suggest buying this camera at all. Additionally, I purchased this from Portable Guy, a third party vendor with Amazon.com. I will never do that again. Amazon honors partial refunds after the inital 30 day full refund period has passed. When I reached out to Portable Guy, he was unable to do any sort of refund for me and did not seem to care that I was having issues with the camera.

I wanted something that took quality pictures, had a good amount of optical zoom, and had a decent amount of features, but not some $500+ camera with a bunch of features that I would never use. This camera fits the bill perfectly.The 8X zoom Schneider lens is really great. It lets you get in nice and close and the auto focus does a really good job when zooming in. You can also change the setting to macro, which will let you take close up pictures of really small things like flowers or other small objects and still pick up the fine details. The LCD screen is big enough to see well, and give a nice clear image when viewing the photos you've taken.I also use this camera to take product photos for my business. The macro feature combined with the the adjustable exposure compensation makes it really easy to take nice and bright, vibrant, close up photos of our products. I barely have to edit the images at all before uploading them to the web.

It's very easy to use, small enough to carry in a pocket, but large enough to make it easy to hold.  Pictures turn out just fine - and I don't have real steady hands.  The 8X zoom at this price is a nice feature.  The only down sides are: 1) The power button is super small.  You almost need to get the edge of your fingernail in there to turn it on or off.  2) It sometimes freezes.  You can download and install the firmware upgrade, but it will still freeze sometimes.  When it does you just need to take out the battery and memory card.  Put the battery back in.  Turn it on.  Turn it off.  Then put the memory card back in.  It's a bit of a pain, but it's only happened a couple of times.

I think that the problem one owner reported about the difficulty of displaying the date on the picture is because he did not download/read the owners manual, which states that the date the picture was taken in embedded in the properties of the picture (right click it).  It is easy enough to date stamp the picture, if you want is shown.  However, for me, it is more important to easily access the date than to have it displayed on the picture.  There have been several reports of the camera locking-up.  I have not had this happen and believe that it is due to pushing two buttons simultaneously and confusing the firmware.  I understand that Kodak has a firmware update though, I have had no problems and have not researched/downloaded it.  The buttons are rather close to each other and I would have designed them differently.  After I took a few pictures, I was used to it.

The first problem we noticed is the buttons on the top are all clumped together and easy to fat finger (or if you have gloves on or something) then you can't take a picture easily or you turn the flash off instead of taking a picture (and turning the camera on quickly to catch that magic moment is problematic).  That alone was really annoying.  But it gets worse, most of the pictures are blurry.  Prompting me to say to my wife we should throw this thing away.  It was a half joke because it costs too much money to just throw away.  But then, after about a month of mild and occasional use, the lens stopped retracting.  It tries to retract but doesn't.  I was glad.  It made me feel a lot better about throwing it away for real.  I didn't even bother with the warranty.  I don't want this thing fixed or replaced.
