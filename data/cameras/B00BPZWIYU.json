enough that when it falls off my skateboard, i'm not freaking out. This is a video i took with the camera attached to my skateboard and then a little hand-held action. of course it ends with me crashing, lol.

So far it seems to be pretty durable, he had been using the waterproof case to protect the camera. Overall great product and a good price!

Upon taking it out of the package I noticed that it was not the best of quality, but then again I never expected it to be a GoPro. I followed the directions, plugged it in for a bit to charge and then unplugged it and pressed the power button. The display screen lit up and everything seemed ready for action. I then pressed the record button to take a sample video of my kids playing in the house and it did nothing. I then tried to switch modes and it did nothing. I figured maybe I would need to turn it off and back on so I pressed and held the power button and it did nothing! The thing is stuck \"on\" with the display screen showing everything I point it at, but it will not function in any way at all!

I needed a small waterproof camera to share the fun times with friends and family. The good part is that it comes with enough mounting gear to be fastened to moving vehicles. The quality of the pictures is pretty low, though. Even in full bright light the still pictures have a blue-ish tint to it and very strong jpeg compression creates lots of weird artifacts. The videos are not as bad as the sill pics but still very very grainy, makes me wonder if it's really using the HD resolution. I use only the highest resolution available.
