{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Camera of My Dreams (But know what you're buying)", "Author": "Daniel Neve \"Photo Pro\"", "ReviewID": "R3HXB218M9RUE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello everybody, My name is Daniel and I am about as serious as you can be and still be considered \"amateur\". I have been taking photos on SLR's since I was 10 years old on an old film Minolta and I bought my first DSLR (a Nikon D50) and since then I have owned everything from a base line Canon XSi all the way up to the the best camera I have ever handled... the D300s. I have operated the D3, D3s, D3x and the top of the line professional $10k Canons, and this is still my favorite ALL AROUND camera. So here is the break down to why I love this camera and I will give you a list of pros and cons. I love this camera for many reasons... [...]... not many people can justify spending another $4,000 (2-3 times the money) when they are looking to spend around $1,500- $2,000 for a good DSLR. So here is the benefits that I see to D300s over the other great Nikon models.1. if you are into sports the D300s has a higher continuous frame rate than other models including the ever so popular full frame D700. With it's DX sensor it has a crop factor of 1.5 which means more bang for you buck when using a telephoto zoom lens. If you purchase the MB-D10 battery pack it will shoot at even higher speeds of 8fps when using continuous shooting and also allows for up to nearly 5,000 pictures to be taken on one charge (when upgraded battery is purchased). With 51 auto-focus and 3-D tracking you are almost guaranteed to have your subject in focus every time you take a picture. The D300s also features Active D Lighting which makes to so your pictures end up properly exposed so you don't end up with areas of under and over exposure which tend to be common in sports and in shadowy landscape photography2. Freedom: although all Nikon DSLR's allow you to manually adjust your settings they are difficult to change until you get to the semi-pro D300 model. If you understand f-stops, DOF, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, focus points, light metering and other technical jargon and really want to experiment with all of these then a D300s is the camera for you. with shooting modes including: single, cont. low speed, high speed, timer, quiet, and mirror up mode this camera gives you all the freedom you could ever ask for.3. Learning: this camera will make you learn the true in's and out's of photography. With the very accurate light meter it's not very hard to get the exposure right. No matter what your ISO and f stop is at.4. User interface. With the dedicated live view and info button new to the D300s over the original D300 it cuts menu times down significantly however it no longer has the memory card hatch release switch. The D300s includes great features such as custom menus, easy to understand menus with the classic (?) button which will explain every camera function in easy to understand terms. On the fly changes include ISO, WB, Quality, shooting modes, a user adjusted fn button, AF/AE lock, light metering, and af adjustments. So the only limitations are your imagination. Selecting your focal point is as easy as looking in the viewfinder and pushing the directional button and watching the selector move around until you have exactly the right spot selected. With two selectors (one for shutter speed and one for f stop) it allows you to never have to take your eye out out of the viewfinder.The bottom line (why you would choose this over any other Nikon DSLR):why you'd choose this over the D90: 51point AF w/ 3D tracking, more fps, control of image adjustments, not much more money for a lot more freedom and creativity, contrast auto-focusing during movies, ability to utilize dual card slots (CF and SD), 14bit RAW, Active D Lighting.Over the D700: full 12MP when using DX lenses rather than 5MP, more fps, $600-$1,000 less, movie mode, smaller pixels for more refinement at low ISO, 100% viewfinder coverageOver the D3 and D3x: A ton of money, shooting speed, optimization of DX and FX lenses and movie mode, and built in flash, 100% viewfinder coverage which allows for better framing.This is a great camera HOWEVER NOTE THE FOLLOWING!!!!!The D700, D3,x,s have FX photo sensors which allow for a much bigger and brighter view finder, it also allows for a wider view (no crop factor instead of 1.5x like the DX) which means if you want more area in your pictures for such things as landscapes then the D700 or the D3 lineup maybe a better option because a 50mm lens in a DX camera looks the same as a 75mm lens on an FX camera.The D700 and D3 lineup (minus the D3x) utilize the large FX sensor and still only have a 12MP capacity which means that the pixels are larger which allows for better depth of color, better definition in shadows, and better high ISO clarity. The D300 can go to extended ISO of 6400 however the image quality is poor at best when the D3 can shoot ISO 6400 all day long and look great. The D700 also does better at high ISOs than the D300 does because it has the same sensor as the D3 however the D3 still does better than the D700 at extreme ISOs. However also consider the fact that the smaller the image sensor the larger the depth of field so the D700 and the D3 are better for macro or portrait photography and the D300 will give you a larger DOF equivalent to about one f-stop.THIS IS NOT A VIDEO CAMERA video is pretty good and the utilization of lenses is a great feature however if you want good video spend the money on a video camera. Even a Flip HD does better. The camera produces good video but it doesn't do well during panning if you plan on putting the camera on a tripod and filming then by all means its fine and with the option for an external mic to give you stereo sound is nice.When it comes to portability, price, features, weight, usability, image adjustments ect. I personally believe it doesn't get any better I hope this review helped and I hope you get one too and really enjoy it as much as I have. This camera is the best of all worlds. I say save the money from an FX camera and buy a really nice lens or two or three for that matter. Anyway here is the camera of my dreams and hopefully the camera in your bag shortly I promise you'll love it, I know I do.UPDATE: For all you HDR photographers look no further than the D300s you can easily create HDR photos by selecting \"multiple exposures\" and then setting up multi-step exposures for + or - EV per exposure and after the exposures are done voila you have a beautiful HDR photo. Keep in mind however: you will need a cable release (I recommend the MC-36) for the multiple exposures. OR take a few pictures at different exposures and overlay the photos in the in camera retouch menu and there you have it perfect HDR photos every time! Goodbye Photoshop (for HDR anyway)The D300s and flash compatibility: I have noticed almost no one has talked about the fantastic flash compatibility with the D300s over many cameras. I figured it needed to be covered so here it goes: The D300s is a DREAM to work with when paired with any Nikon Speedlight Dynamic Lighting System. My favorite and most frequently used flash is the SB-600 Speedlight which can be wirelessly operated for NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE with the D300s, you just have to know what settings to change. Unlike the D3 which has to either have a hot shoe flash controller unit or an SB-800 ($900) the D300s can operate a nearly unlimited number of flashes wirelessly without any accessories. So if you are like so many other Nikon users and own an SB-600 just push and hold the \"Zoom\" and the \"-\" button at the same time until you get to custom menu and cycle through until you can adjust the squiggly Z shaped line and turn it to on and it defaults to channel 3 then either push and hold the \"zoom\" and \"-\" button to get out of the menu or just push the power button. Then go to the \"Custom Setting Menu\" (the pencil) on your D300s and change \"e3\" \"flash cntrl for built-in flash\" to the Commander mode and set to channel 3, and pop up your built in flash and there you go...ABSOLUTELY FREE WIRELESS FLASH with perfect exposure compensation every time using a $250 flash unit. Hope it helps someone I know it helped me so have fun and remember to change it back to TTL flash when you're done.UPDATE #2: I have had a lot of question on why you would get this over a D300 and here you go the main reasons for buying the D300s over the D300 is the designated info button, and live view button, movie mode, designated okay button instead of one crappy directional selector, quiet mode AND dual memory card slots. It's also 7 months newer so you won't have an out dated camera as soon. It also has slightly different menus and new software for shooting modes including landscape, and portrait modes.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "A word of warning if you're buying a D300S for its video capabilities", "Author": "Lon J.

However, if you're currently a D300 owner looking to upgrade for this camera's new video capabilities you will be disappointed.  The unfortunate 'rolling shutter' problem that plagues the video feature on the D90 exists on the new D300s too.There's a host of technical reasons for this (the CMOS sensor is to blame) but the bottom line for those looking for a great still and video camera should probably not rely on the D300S to be the 'holy grail' of  sub $2000 \"prosumer\" cameras just yet.  There is software out there to correct these issues, but it is a bit disappointing that Nikon didn't address this in firmware.  Watch my video to see more.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "State of the DX art, better than FX for some", "Author": "Glenn Carpenter", "ReviewID": "R54UUOLSIWQBU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are plenty of very good comprehensive reviews here of the D300S here already, so I'm instead of posting another I'm going to attempt to focus on what I see as some of the pros and cons of the D300S versus other camera bodies in the Nikon line-up.  The D300S has essentially identical image quality to the $500 D5000 and the now quite old (in DSLR terms) D300 and D90; and it remains a small-format DX camera while the next step up in price gets you a full-frame D700.  Even so, my personal choice for the majority of my photography is a D300S rather than any of those alternatives.  I have also owned and shot with every other camera mentioned here: all are excellent and I believe all can be considered good values for the money spent in today's market.  Perhaps some readers would find my perspective useful.As far as I'm concerned, image quality from Nikon DSLRs has really been quite excellent at least since the introduction of the D70.  Of course there have been all kinds of incremental improvements since then, but comparing anything since the D70 to the funky highlights produced by the earlier D100, for example, makes it clear that we have long since reached the point of diminishing returns when it comes to real, visible improvements in DSLR image quality.  In terms of the finer points it will continue to improve, but whether you buy a D5000, a D300S or a D700, the differences between the images you can make with the camera are going to be tiny compared with the differences in how you can use it - with the exception of the FX-vs-DX field of view, which is very important.What I think most people will benefit from is carefully assessing the features and physical capabilities of the various bodies, considering the types of photography they like to do, and selecting the best match for their particular needs.  Budget, of course, enters the equation: but for many photographers the small, light D5000 would be the best choice regardless of budget, while of course others will absolutely require the pro features of the more expensive bodies.D300S vs D700; DX vs FX - By far the most fundamental issue in camera body selection:This is the one real difference between the shooting capabilities of any of the bodies I'm writing about here, and it affects every image you make with the camera once you buy it.  I would strongly advise readers NOT to look at format as a camera issue, but to look at it as a lens issue.  Of course there are differences between the FX and DX bodies, even those closest in specification, and to some degree it's possible to equalize lens selection: but when you begin to look at the practical realities of lens selection for DX vs FX formats, it is immediately apparent that they operate in completely different worlds.  I'm convinced that this should be one's primary consideration when choosing a camera, assuming that your budget allows you a choice between the formats.The heart of the matter is that it really is much easier to make a great DX lens than it is to make a great FX lens.  The basic physics guarantees it.  The DX format is 2/3 the linear size of the FX format, meaning that, all else being equal, lenses will have to be 3.4 TIMES BIGGER (1.5^3) in FX format to exactly equal the optics on DX of a DX format lens.  Because lens design is a matter of careful compromise between many factors mainly size, price, max aperture, zoom ratio, sharpness, and weight; real-world FX lenses aren't made 3.4 times bigger, heavier and more expensive than DX lenses.  They are instead made only considerably bigger, with compromises in other aspects of design - so that they must give up some aspect of performance: zoom ratio, max aperture, optical excellence - to achieve their design objectives.Because of this, there is really no FX equivalent to the excellent 16-85mm VR DX lens (the 24-120VR is a fairly mediocre lens despite being physically larger).  Likewise the 35mm f/1.8 has come out being a slightly better lens than the 50mm f/1.4G despite being smaller and lighter (though slower, unfortunately).  Many excellent wide zooms now exist for DX cameras at affordable prices, while the selection of FX wide zooms has one choosing between obscenely heavy and expensive excellent lenses and \"normally\" priced average lenses.  This conundrum spans the entire range of available lenses, and it is likely never to change or to resolve in favor of FX because it is driven by the basic physics of optics and their design and manufacture.For this reason, DX cameras have tremendous advantages if you want to shoot lenses that are reasonably priced, that give excellent sharpness and overall image quality, that have flexible zoom ranges, and that are light and compact enough to transport and use unobtrusively.FX, on the other hand, will be marketed as the premier format, and I think we can expect that most of the very best lenses made will continue to be FX lenses.  Very fast primes, f/2.8 zooms built to pro specifications, long telephotos and the best macro lenses will all be FX.  FX lenses can of course be used on DX cameras, but that realization leads to the other FX advantages.  While the DX \"crop factor\" gives DX bodies a presumed advantage in the telephoto range, it conversely gives FX cameras a sizeable advantage within the \"normal\" ranges most people do most of their shooting at.  A 50mm lens on FX equals a 35mm lens on DX in terms of field of view, but allows for much better control of subject isolation than the DX lens.  Likewise, a \"fast wide\" lens on FX such as the new 24mm f/1.4G becomes a much less exotic creature on DX, and probably rather pointless as a consequence.  For portraiture, the selection of lenses for FX is wonderful, if expensive, whereas DX shooters must compromise by using lenses not designed for their native format.For photographers who shoot mostly in the normal ranges, who want to maximize their control of depth of field (especially towards the wide end), who don't mind paying a premium for the most expensive equipment, and who are willing to put up with the weight and the conspicuousness of shooting with pro-level equipment as well as the compromises inherent in FX lens design, FX will continue to be the only option.There is one more advantage currently in shooting FX, in that the FX sensors are more light-sensitive than the DX sensors, enabling shooting at tremendous ISOs, well above the DX level.  This will probably always remain so: the FX sensor is bigger, and can gather more light.  Whether this is important to a particular user really depends on the types of photography they like to do, but it should be appropriately factored into the decision.  Likewise FX cameras have larger viewfinders, which will probably never be possible on DX cameras: another luxury of FX shooting that does not directly translate to the images that can be produced.Personally, having been a film shooter in the past, I find my needs more than satisfied by DX bodies, at least for the time being.  A selection of excellent, lightweight lenses suffices for the vast majority of my photography, while I can put up with the compromises inherent in some parts of the range, especially for fast wide shooting.  I'd like some fast prime lens options in the range of 16-28mm for DX but I can live with their absence considering the cost, both financial and in terms of lost flexibility, of switching to FX.D300S vs D300 vs D90My upgrade path went from the D40 through the D90 and D300 and then to the D300S.  I loved every one of those bodies except, notably, the D300, which was in some ways a step backwards in comparison to the D90 and which I was never completely satisfied with.  I do currently have a D700 as well.The D90 is still a great camera, affording the vast majority of capabilities of the D300S, the exceptions being the inherent handling and feature advantages of the pro bodies.  The D90 is also much lighter and physically smaller than the pro bodies, making it a very pleasant camera to shoot, and I would still be using mine were it not for just a couple of relatively minor improvements that make the D300S worth the upgrade for me.  The pro bodies let you define custom setting banks, so that I can switch between different types of shooting easily.  Since I do this daily, this is very important to me.  Switching from an indoor, tripod-mounted shooting configuration to an outdoor, hand-held shooting configuration on a D90 takes a lot of button presses and a couple of minutes, and there is always the very likely possibility of forgetting to change one critical parameter and not realizing it until it's too late.  No matter how serious a photographer you are, if you shoot mostly in similar conditions all the time, or in constantly changing conditions such that pre-defined shooting banks would be useless, then this feature is probably meaningless to you.  It happens to be very useful to me.Likewise the D300S has a couple of features lacking in the D300 that allow for quick settings changes: several shooting parameters (not enough, though) can be changed quickly right on the rear LCD as on the D40/60/3000/5000 bodies, which I find very useful.  Also useful, the D300S' function buttons can be programmed to put you at the top selection of a custom-defined menu.  Between these two features I can access and change almost any of the commonly-altered settings on the D300S (or the D90/D700) very quickly, while the D300 had me hunting through the menu system for far too long.  This alone is a significant upgrade in camera handling for the D300S compared to the D300, and by itself would merit the upgrade in my case.I wish any of these cameras could be programmed so that the LCD info screen would come on automatically between shots as can be done with the D40-style bodies.  I think buyers of higher-end bodies probably consider this an unnecessary or amateur feature, but in my opinion, that is not so at all!  Especially when shooting on a tripod, the info screen is a much quicker and more complete information reference than the top LCD, and especially if ALL the settings could be set directly through it, this would be another extremely valuable aid to quick settings changes.  Today's cameras have so many settings, and they need to be changed so often to get the best possible image, that anything Nikon could do to give users quicker access to more settings would be a step forward for photographers of any experience level.Other major differences between the D90 and D300S are, in order of approximate decreasing importance to me, are: 1) Better focus system on D300 and D300S, 2) External buttons and switches to quickly change focus and meter settings on D300 and D300S, 3) Usefully quicker continuous shooting speed on D300 and even quicker on D300S (4.5fps for D90, 6fps for D300, 7fps for D300S), 4) Decently weather-sealed body on D300 and D300S, 5) Rugged pro build quality on D300 and D300S (comes at a cost, though, much larger and heavier), 6) AF fine-tuning on D300 and D300S.  There are many more differences between the cameras than these, but these are the ones that matter to me.There is one more biggie.  The D300S, unlike either the D300 or D90 (or D700 for that matter), has two memory card slots, and I happen to love the fact that one holds an SD card and the other a CF card.  Most pros prefer CF cards.  I'm not a pro, and I prefer SD cards.  What I love about this feature, though, is that there is a setting which allows the camera to write a jpeg to one card and a RAW file to the other.  I shoot jpeg most of the time but RAW some of the time, and this is by far the easiest way to go between jpeg-only and jpeg-plus-RAW, while ALSO getting all the RAW shots segregated from the jpegs so that you can later decide either to discard them, or to download them to a different folder, at a different time, without any fancy file-download trickery.  When not using this feature the second card can be set to duplicate or to overflow, although I would prefer there to be more flexibility as to which card does what function.While the D300S is the \"best\" of these bodies in many ways, the features it has over the D90 are just not going to matter to everybody, and the D90 is smaller and lighter enough that it's very seriously worth considering if you don't need them.  The D90 is one of the best-positioned, best bang for the buck bodies Nikon has yet made, while the D300S is a superb camera but gives diminishing returns for the dollar, and by the ounce, in comparison.D300S vs D5000I know beyond any doubt that there are a lot of photographers buying pro cameras that would be much better served with a smaller, easier to use, easier to carry and handle and store body, and if you can't decide whether to start slow or to go all-out with a pro body, you should really take a look at the D5000.  In terms of its ability to capture any given image, the D5000 is the equal of the D300S, and only the time it takes to get that image, or the variety of lenses you can use to do so, really differs.  The handling of the D300S, with its multiplicity of features and settings, is going to slow down, not speed up, the process for people who don't use the camera often enough to stay fluent in the layout of its controls and functions.  The D5000 gives you much of the flexibility, all of the image quality, and less size, cost, and weight.  I personally enjoy the smaller cameras very much.  I prefer their smaller size and only use the larger, heavier bodies because they have capabilities the smaller bodies lack, and those capabilities are important to me.  If those capabilities are of questionable importance to you, consider your needs carefully before you encumber yourself with their extra weight and extra expense.ConclusionI'm going to give the D300S a rating of four stars.  Clearly it is only intended to be a minor upgrade with respect to the D300, and it uses the same now-aging sensor used in all these cameras, so it's natural to expect that it is not a blockbuster on the new camera scene.  It's not intended to be: Nikon has been busy developing FX bodies and adding to its lens line over the past year or two.  This particular corner of the lineup is getting a breather.  It is a tremendously competent camera, the top DX body currently available from Nikon, and an excellent tool for the job of photography under almost all conditions.  It would be surprising not to see an improvement on the subject of sensor technology within the coming months or year, which would be incorporated into a successor in time.  I do think Nikon needs to get to work figuring out ways to make the control interfaces of today's pro cameras more intuitive to use.  Better menu systems, more easily accessed; more flexibility in the use of the rear LCD to view and change settings; more flexibility in the enabling of custom menus and setting banks (which are useful but limited as currently implemented), would be high on my list of improvements.  Nikon by its nature prefers to evolve its cameras incrementally over a period of years, and although that's a good strategy in some ways, other times it means we get stuck with \"legacy\" after-effects: backwards-reading meters, mechanical lens interfaces, and old style menu systems that have begun to overflow their banks.  Some streamlining of the user experience would make the cameras easier, quicker and more flexible in use.In a relative sense, though, those things remain nitpicks.

I was actually saving up for the 300 and they released the 300s.  This is the top of the line DX camera from Nikon which is loaded with features.  I can't compare the 300 to the 300s and you can go on line to sites like Ken Rockwell to see a break down comparison.  However, compared to my old D80 this camera was a big upgrade.With the purchase of this camera I was quickly forced to learn more about photography and after about 3 weeks or so I can now say that I have a good understanding of the camera it's features and settings.  The D80 has pre programmed shooting settings e.g. (landscape, nightshot, portrait, Auto etc.) which automatically sets everything for you.  This camera really forces you to learn about photography.  ISO's WB, shutter speed, aperature etc. If you are looking for a more user friendly camera with pre programmed setting I would go with the D90.  If you want a more serious enthusiast to pro level camera than the D300s is your choice.The D300s also has a video mode which in my opinion isn't half bad.  However, if video is not that important to you I would go with a used D300 which you can probably get a great deal on.  I've taken some video with this camera and the mic is very sensitive.  I wouldn't try using the video for recording live shows which I did.  Even at low sensitivity mic settings I had problems with the sound.  The good thing is the 300s has an external mic connection. I believe the D90 does not. I haven't experimented with this feature.Picture quality has been great!  However, i've always been a firm believer that aside from the camera the lens plays a major role in picture quality.  If you want superb pics I suggest investing in good lenses.I use this camera mainly for sports and action photography.  The D300s provides 7fps and with the external MB battery pack 8fps.  My old D80 shot at 3-4fps.  I have definitely seen a huge difference in this regard.  This camera is super fast!

Previously, I used a Nikon D70, a 6-megapixel DSLR. I honestly think that the D70 is a fine camera and takes beautiful pictures if you use good lenses with it, but I got the D300s because it is much faster at focussing (51 focus sensors vs. 5 focus sensors), and can snap pictures at 7 frames per second (versus 3 frames per second for the D70). So now I feel I'm getting great pictures of my fast-moving daughter that I probably would have missed with my older camera. As for the quality of the pictures themselves, I don't notice any significant improvement from the D70, which already produced excellent pictures as long as things were moving slowly enough for it to lock focus.The bottom line is this: If you're often dealing with fast-moving subjects, then the very fast focus and the machine-gun like 7 frames per second capability of the D300s will maximize your chances of getting good shots. The reason to get this camera is for its SPEED. That's what you're paying extra for when you buy this camera over a lower-priced Nikon SLR. If, on the other hand, you don't need the high speed (e.g., landscape and scenery pictures), then get a D40 or D90 and use the money you save on a good lens.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "No regrets", "Author": "Bilal Mirza \"IT Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R2KYO60MGS6XFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll keep it short and sweet, and my review will also include the review of the 18-200 VR II which was bundled with the D300S as a kit.Pros:Dual-slots: This was crucial for me when deciding which camera to purchase because I shoot weddings... and there's no way to recreate the magic of the original moment if your card fails at the wrong time.

D300S and the D90 share plenty of similarities.I am not going to repeat all the positive features (the frame speed, dual memory-card slots, 51 AF points, and many more) of this camera other than to say I agree.However, I think the major weakness about this camera is actually what many considered to be its strength, which is the Auto Focus ability.  As you know, of the 51 AF points in the D300S, 15 of them are \"cross-type\" focus-point sensor, all locating in the centre, and the remaining 36 are \"horizontal-type\" focus point sensor spreading on the two sides.  While the 15 cross AF points are fast very accurate, the line AF points aren't, especially if the subject has pattern going the same direction as the line AF points.  You will need to tilt it to get the AF to work/lock in and then move it back, and they feel much less assuring than the D90's 11 AF points.Also, the D300S and the D90 are said to share the same sensor or at least an almost identical one.  However, for some reasons, the D90 appears to have a better noise control in a low light/higher ISO situation (ISO 400 - 1600).I give this camera a solid 4.5 stars, and still glad that I made the purchase.

I'm pretty sure no one is hinged on purchasing this camera BECAUSE of the video features.  In my time with this very capable DSLR, I've touched the video feature maybe twice - and both times just to show-off to a colleague.I have only 3 minor complaints:-Weight of the unit makes it tiresome to handle all day.  The handful or weddings and other events I've shot with it have left me exhausted.  However - you know its built like a tank, and can take a good deal of abuse and function perfectly.-Size of the unit makes it look stupid with an SB600 flash on top - get the new (massively great) SB900 to photog in style. ;)-No bump up in MP?  Makes sense since it isn't a major redesign of the model, just a \"value added\" model.Final thoughts -The D300s is the D300 with video and some slightly (very slightly) improved features.  If you can do without the (rarely used) video features - the D300 will net you virtually the same performance.Because of the D300s' launch, watch for the original D300 prices to slide and grab yourself a steal on a very capable camera with an even friendlier-to-the-paycheck price tag sans video.Let me know if this helped!", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "NICE Camera!!!", "Author": "Marc Ruby\u2122 \"The Noh Hare\u2122\"", "ReviewID": "RFXNIHZHFWE05", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned Nikons almost since they were first available here and I've always been happy with the performance of their cameras.  But this is the first time I've been ecstatic over one.  I switched from using the old N90s to a D90 two years ago and while I liked the camera, I was put off by the amount of plastic in what was, after all, a $1000 body.  I also found the controls a bit hard to get along with -- I'm not a fan of spending a lot of time paging through menus.  When the D300s came out I had a chance to buy one and it proved an answer to my complaints about the D90.The new camera is magnesium.  It's 8 ounces heavier than the D90 so it balances better with the heavy 2.8 lenses I usually use.  To tell the truth I had a short period of frantic manual reading when I first started using the D300s.  Nikon has shifted the controls around so that menu hopping is needed less often, and that's a blessing.  It offers about a zillion focusing and metering options - While I normally stick to spot evaluation the camera offers some 51 spots which can be used individually or in groups.Comparing photos to the D90 I would say theres a definite improvement in the images, although it's subtle.  And there are more internal processing options as well.  Yet another neat feature is that the camera takes two memory cards.  This really is as far as you can take a 12 megapixel camera.  Even though Nikon rates this a semi-pro camera the quality of image will answer most photographer's needs for some time to come.

I finally broke down and bought the D300s when I was able to get it from Amazon during a \"short\" window sale price of $1449.  Boy, am I am happy I broke down and bought this camera!

The 51 point focus system is sooooo much faster and accurate than the 11-point D90.  Also, the camera controls are far superior to the D90 for making changes to the shooting/focusing settings during shooting.  No more taking the camera down from your face to make changes, thus missing that perfect moment or composition.  Finally, stepping up from 1/4000th to 1/8000th shutter speed is a huge difference!

Sometime with my D90 I literally watch it go into and out of focus as its trying to lock on the object. The D300s just blasts into focus as quick as can be.Two cards, one CF, one SDHC make recording in both RAW/NEF and JPEG much easier to manage (recording one format to one card, the other to the other card, you get to pick). And don't worry if do not have a CF card reader, the included USB cable makes connecting it to your PC or Mac as ease as connecting the USB to the camera and to the PC/Mac-no reader necessary.The controls are a bit much for a prosumer user but the good news is you can learn them over time and still shoot great shots right out of the box. The PSAM dial is there and works wonderful--although unlike the D90/D60/D40 it is located on the right side of the camera via the MODE button and the command dial. I actually like this setup better.Please note, there are no consumer \"scene modes\" (auto, fast, night, macro, etc.) but the \"P\" mode (program mode) is the only \"auto everything\" setting you should be using anyway, and it works very well.For the pros, this camera is built like a tank--its fits and feels well in the hand and has enough mass to counter any long lens balance.The bottom line on this camera is WOW!Having said all that.

Its the best thing Nikon offers today.I will say this, however, unlike virtually everyone else I've spoken with, the D300s is a big change from the D300 and the D200. It is a lot more modern design and the controls are improved for the better and the LCD preview screen on the back is much better.Like all Nikons, the D300s video feature isn't very good. One thing many people do not realize is that AutoFocus does NOT work in Video mode. So you have to lock down the focus and then shoot. If the subject moves out of range, you have to stop, refocus and start shooting again. This is what film makers do, not consumers.

I was very happy with the D70s however I needed a larger pixel count for the large prints I prefer to make (13x19\"+). I agree with many pro's that have advised that you don't need more than 8MP if you are producing 8x10's or even 11x14 full frame in most cases. If you go beyond that print size or crop severely for 11x14's, then a larger pixel count is where you need to be.The D300s has been a perfect camera for me. I certainly put it in the prosumer category. It should not be your first camera. If you shoot mostly Auto or like to point and shoot, the D300s is not for you even if you have the money. It is very full-featured/complex camera and to get good pictures and your money's worth you need to be willing to invest the time to learn its many modes and capabilities. It is capable of shooting great pictures in very low light or in fast moving scenes with its wide ISO range, very low noise and advanced focus system. The ergonomics feel just right to me unlike many Canons I have tried. It has good balance and a very solid feel (metal frame). I shoot often with a Nikon 70-200mm f2.8 VR that is heavy and a good grip and balance is important for me.I have found the color and resolution to be superb. I easily get professional (saleable) 13 x19\"  prints working through Lightroom 2.5 and Photoshop CS4 to a Canon Pro 9000 MkII printer. The D300s' many focus, white balance and color modes are a great help in a rapidly changing shoot. I have programmed several custom settings for both studio and outdoor work. Its great to be able to shift multiple camera settings with one button push. The \"Info\" button alone should keep you from buying the D300 vs D300s.The dual memory card setup is also great. I switch between using the second card as a backup for important shoots to using it in overflow mode when I'm out for a long shoot. I shoot RAW most of the time and the safety of the overflow mode keeps me in the shooting flow so I don't have to stop, lose the mood and change memory cards. I often add a power grip  when I'm using multi-Speedlight set-ups with a remote commander. The Nikon Remote Commander can draw down the main battery over the course of a long studio shoot. Otherwise the battery will easily do a full day and hundreds of shots. The Info button instantly shows you battery condition as a % in both the main and power grip.

If you've never owned a DSLR, it does take some experimentation with settings and lighting to see what the camera can do and how the pictures will turn out.

Also, learning and familiarizing yourself with the controls really helps when snapping shots of young kids that that tend to move incessantly.- The picture quality is awesome (no surprise here and universally agreed upon by most reviews)...especially when I compare it to pics taken with my ultra portable point and shoot Canon SD630.- The layout and functions are quite intuitive and easy to use so it wasn't hard to get the hang of it (and a good guide book really helps).- The construction seems very solid, you can feel it in your hands.- External flash is very key in getting good results.- I purchased it with the 18mm-200mm VR-II lens.  The lens was very expensive but if you could only get one lens, it's definitely a great all around lens.  Also surprisingly compact for a telephoto zoom.- Favorite feature...dual card slots, ability to save JPEG to one slot and RAW to the other provides a lot of flexibility.- Haven't played around with the video yet so I can't really comment.  But I think the built in mono mic is sort of a lame feature.  If Nikon can provide HD video, it should at least have stereo sound.  There is an optional mic you can purchase but again, it's another thing you would need to buy and another thing you will have to lug around.- The only gripe is that it is EXPENSIVE.  But if you are into photography and preserving moments of your kids and family, it's probably worth the money.

This camera is great; however, it took me a little while to figure out the autofocus (AF) system. I switched from Canon because I truly do not like the size of their files (18MP is way beyond what I need). I like shooting when the subjects are in motion--not necessarily action--and learning how to focus properly is crucial for me. After reading the manual and playing around with the AF, I feel much better with the D300S. I am not new to photography--started with Minolta SLRs and then moved to Canon dSLRs--but I can safely say that the D300S has allowed me to take my best shots. I am still a bit reluctant to use the 6400 ISO, but the 3200 ISO works fine.This camera is not for beginners. If you are not familiar with photography lingo, reading the manual would be frustrating. Moreover, the Program Mode is not the greatest. The video feature is dandy, but you have to keep the camera still. I have used the video feature a couple of times, and the image quality is fine as long as you use a tripod and don't move the camera too much.

After about a year with an entry level Nikon D40 I struggled a bit with which camera to select next. The D90 or D300s were my prime candidates. - I first ended up with the D90 of sheer budget reasons. The D300s was just released and fairly expensive. However the D90 was a good choice FOR ME at that time because I was not ready to drop the auto-programs (portrait, sports, etc.). The D300s has only (Aperture, Shutter, Program and Manual). Under pressure it was nice to have some of those auto modes to revert to.A half year later I bought a second hand D300s at a very good price. - What made me choose the D300s now? - More practicing with the manual mode had made me confident that I could actually handle the camera without the auto-programs. This is important. If you buy this camera too early, then you probably will be frustrated. Understanding of the exposure triangle is required to get the results you are seeking. Are you ready to drop the ability to make your DSLR a point-and-shoot camera?Where I live it rains a lot and the D300s weather sealed rugged body is really attractive (in combination with a weather sealed SB-900 flash). I also craved the faster AF (51 AF-points a BIG plus for moving targets) as well as a shutter speed 1/8000 sec which let me use larger aperture at bright days). A few more buttons to control parameters have also come to good use.In my opinion the multi selector on the D90 is more pleasant to handle but I soon got used to the selector of the D300s. The ISO-performance do not seem to exceed the performance of the D90. The AWB seem to be at least as good as the AWB on the D90. Just my subjective opinion.I have used the video several times (clips from concerts), and gotten reasonably good results. - I did not consider video as important when choosing the camera - and still don't. But nice to have anyway.The D90 was a great camera and so is the D300s. I sold my D90 a couple of months after buying the D300s. For me I feel the D300s camera is more solid in my hands and the loss of auto-programs forces me to think more.

I have had the D300s for about a year and a half now, bringing it around different events and trips. It's still performing as great now as it did the first day I got it. I've since bought a SanDisk Extreme 16GB CF card, and even with RAW the buffer never really fills up. ISO performance still stands up well to others in it's category, and the weathersealing was more than helpful around the sand and salt water of the beach, as well as the torrential rain that periodically passes over my home.I still recommend this camera as an intermediate between entry level DSLRs and the pro-range D700/D800 and D3/D3x/D3s/D4. AF is still great, and the af fine-tune is really useful for calibrating focus on large-aperture lenses like the 50mm 1.8 D lens and the Sigma 17-50 f/2.8 OS. It really helped me get the most out of those lenses.It's still been my best friend since day one.PROS:1) It's tough. I mean *really* tough. It's been through mist, drops, bumps, jostles, and a whole bunch of shaking. No matter where you take it, be it hot or cold, it'll work as it should.2) It's reliable. This fits in with the toughness aspect of the camera. Every single feature and command works every time. Exposure is consistent and usually spot-on. (Exceptions include extremely bright and dark areas and back-lit subjects.)3) The AF is accurate and fast. When I used my friend's Nikon 50mm f/1.8 AF-D in a low-light theater for some assignment photos, they came out perfect most of the time.4) Image quality is top-notch, even at high-ISOs.5) The wireless flash commander works wonders. Even though you'll need to use the pop-up flash to activate the off-camera flash, you can minimize the effects of the pop-up flash by turning it down to 1/64 power and positioning the speedlight properly. This is useful for street portraiture or studio work.6) Video's convenient and handy. It's a nice way to get some video while working. Best part, if you feel like taking a picture at any moment, press the shutter and you can take a photo.7) Ergonomics are genius. All the buttons and moldings are perfect for my hands, and I rarely feel cramped or awkward while holding it. It only starts to feel cramped when I've been holding it up to my face with a Nikon 70-300mm VR lens to my face. That combo's heavy, mate.CONS:1) It's weight. The D300s is heavy. You get used to it, but holding it up to your eye for hours while photographing a winter football game gets tiresome, fast.2) Video's not quite as good as it could be. I may be a better photographer than videographer and may be using the wrong lenses (photo lenses have shorter focusing distances, making focusing more jerky), but I've gotten mediocre results. DON'T LET THIS MAKE YOU THINK THE D300s IS BAD. If you have the gear to get stable video and the right lenses, you can make amazing videos.The D300s is definitely worth the money, and can hold its own against other brands. The internal AF motor is fast and quiet, and the manual focus is usually on-target. Granted, the viewfinder's not designed for manual focus, but it works well enough. I've been using a Tamron 28mm f/2.8, Nikon 105mm f/4 AI, and Nikon 55mm f/3.5 AI'd manual focus lenses.

So to begin, I would like to mention that I am a part-time professional photographer. I mainly shoot weddings, but have also done portraits and pet photography. I have a full time job, and enjoy doing photography in my free time as a source of creative expression - and also a bonus paycheck.Now, onto the camera. This is the 3rd Nikon DSLR that I have owned. I got into the digital landscape early with the D70 despite the doubt from friends and family. I then upgraded to the D80, while still at college as it was a nice upgrade, but affordable for a college student with serious photography ambitions.When I started to get serious with wedding photography a few months ago, I spent weeks browsing Amazon's reviews for Nikon DSLRs. I finally settled on the D300s and am glad I did. I love the camera. It's fast, easy to use and provides plenty of personalizing the functions to suit my needs.This customization is by far the biggest plus of the camera. Having set my camera for quick bracketing, it allows me to not worry about exposures or the details at a wedding when capturing the moment.The setting dials allow for quick switches between priority modes as well as controlling the aperture and shutter in manual mode. The body feels secure in my hands and the weight is very manageable. Nikon should also be given credit for their battery design as I can shoot for an entire wedding (6+ hours) on just half a battery - negating the need to worry about multiple backups.The dual card slots are also great as the D80 recorded to SD whereas the D300s records to CF primarily, and my SD card selection was already pretty big. Being able to save files to the SD as a backup of the CF image is a great tool, although I primarily use the SD card to record any video.The video in itself is a nice bonus, but by no means should you consider this as a stand alone video camera. Focus is manual and controlling the exposure can be difficult.

Until I had this camera I had concluded that it was not possible to do multiple exposure with digital cameras, as you could with film SLRs, but now I see that it was only with simpler DSLRs that one could not do them.

I am a photographer. If video was my main concern then I would have bought a video camera. The rolling shutter issue commonly mentioned does happen but only when moving or shaking  the camera so fast it would make anyone watching the video dizzy or sick. I have played with the video for the fun of it and non of the videos have had the rolling shutter issue so I really don't think it is much of a problem. I would like to see video dropped so that real useful functions can be added like built-in GPS, voice memos, and built-in wireless data transfer just to name a few.Without getting long winded in trying to explain every technical detail I can tell you that this camera will offer incredible creative control. My D300s replaced a D200 and I am in awe at the improvements the D300s has over the D200. The two cameras are not even a close comparison. The D300s is faster in every category and has great high iso noise reduction, especially for a DX sized sensor.I shoot a lot of winter sports and the D300s has great battery life in cold weather. I am also happy with how quick and accurate the autofocus tracks a fast moving subject. I should mention though that autofocus is noticeably slower when using a Sigma or Tamron lens. The Nikon lenses are lightning fast.All the controls are logically placed and understandable. The menu is incredibly easy to navigate. I especially like how well you can customize nearly every button on the camera to do what ever suits your needs.Another feature I like is how well it controls multiple flash units. This handles the Nikon Creative Lighting System with precision. I could keep rambling on about how much I am enjoying the D300s but I am tired and will stop here.I would highly recommend this camera!

Sme\"", "ReviewID": "R2TMOL7YWFU4WD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The D300s is a product improved D300, featuring a movie mode, \"info\" button, horizon indicator, and so on. Technology wise it's state of the art for 2007.It is a follow-on to the successful D200, and is in every way a major improvement. It still holds it's own today, especially for action and sport shooting.The \"why\" for me on getting this camera is as a backup for my D700. The real deal breaker was frame rate and compatibility with manual focus lenses. I had a real thought about whether to get this or the D7000. The 7000 has a better movie mode (more on that in a bit) and in the photos released so far it's a stop better in high ISO, and since I do a lot of shooting in poor light that was a big consideration.I finally opted for the 300S because it was compatible with my existing battery grip and compact flash memory cards, could give 8 frames a second, and no matter how much better the 7000 is in ISO it still won't compare to the full frame 700. I have a gut feeling the 7000 won't be as good as some people hope, time will tell if I eat my words.Good Points:A \"semi-pro\" Nikon, familiar to anyone who's used one in the past 11 years.Almost identical in layout to my D700, makes switching between cameras easy.Does 6FPS by itself, 8FPS with the MB-D10 battery pack and EN-EL4 battery. (It needs the big battery to go faster, just using the grip with AA's or a single EN-EL3 won't do it.)Meters with and has settings to store for manual focus lenses.Shutter is rated to 150,000 frames.Heavy duty build, weather sealing and magnesium alloy body.Dual card slots, so you can use SD/Compact flash either as backups or an automatic \"spill over\" if you run out. Backup is most useful, in my experience unless you're shooting video, your daily job is taking pictures, or you never download most mortals won't fill up even a 16GB card.\"D-lighting,\" to enhance dynamic range. I have mixed feelings about this, I like it to lessen blown highlights but overdone it makes images low on contrast, and sometimes I like strong shadows. I usually leave it on the low setting.Not so good points:High ISO that was good for the day but now is so-so. My main objection is at 2000 and above or in dim lighting you start getting muddy colors and yellow blotches. How bad this is depends on your preferences and the type of photo.People coming from a D200 will be blown away at how much better it is. Compared to a contemporary D90 it's apples-n-oranges, maybe a slight edge to the D90. Ultimately the ISO performance was my biggest decision to make in getting the 300s, and it finally came down to I already had a camera for good low light shots.Movie mode---where to begin? The 300s offers an \"improved algorithm\" to reduce the jello effect/wobbles that plagued the D90, and an external microphone jack. In those respects the 300s is an improvement; wobble is reduced but is still present if you're unsteady. The fame rate is only 24FPS so you will get jerkiness on fast moving objects or if the camera moves very much.Two camps have come up about movie mode in DLSR's; one that it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, the other that it's a gimmick. After two years with a D90 and now the 300S I'm leaning towards gimmick. The biggest advantage is using interchangeable lenses for limited depth of field, low light, etc. Otherwise you're better off with a generic camcorder for casual use or spending the money on a high end one with it's own interchangeable lenses if you're that serious.The next big gimmick is full-time auto-focus, all I can say is look at the sample videos if you really think it's an improvement.So aside from my soap box rant about movie mode my only real criticism of the 300s is the ISO, in all other respects it's a good semi-pro camera.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "Lori, Lakeside Ca", "ReviewID": "R1201S8RF9P1M7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera prior to leaving for a trip to the Galapagos & Panama.

If you shot a lesser amateur model such as the D60, this is really a step up and you will be challenged in terms of shot composition and camera settings. There is no Auto mode or a dial for Sports or what have you. So, really it makes you become a better photographer because you have to learn how set the camera for the best results.

With the D300s, those settings are now at the flick of a switch on the camera body which is exactly what I was looking for in my next camera.  And that is the key difference between the D300s and the more basic offerings.  I didn't use the pre-programmed settings for portrait, landscape, etc. on the D40 and didn't want them.  Bam!

I could go into a novel of features but instead I will list a few (most of which are NOT available on the D300)of the BEST FEATURES:1. HD video at the touch of a button! No changing dials and switches. In live mode just tap a button and it starts right away. Cool.2. TWO memory cards!! It accept an SD card and a CF card at the same time and you can program what goes into each. So handy, and I just never knew.3. There's a shortcut button for everything! Flash adjustment, Multi-Exposure adjustment, AF lock, AE lock (So you can set your focus of exposure and then move to a different location and it stay until you tell it not to anymore).4. Wireless flash transmitter BUILT-IN. This is huge and you don't know what it is until someone gives you a fancy external flash to use and you can just sit it on the table and it fires without a pricey transmitter sticking out the top of your camera.Those are the top things that I can think of that blow that Canon and the D300 out of the water for me.Try one out for yourself!", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A truly phenominal piece of equipment", "Author": "ChrisInCali", "ReviewID": "RCGSQSUYQC3ZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing.  Auto-focus, blazing fast and always accurate.  I don't know how it does it, but it nails the focus every time no matter what I'm shooting.  With other camera I would always you center-point AF and focus and recompose.  With the D300s I leave it on auto-area and get perfect focus every time.  High iso, one of the best in it's class, better than any Canon cropped sensor camera, and equal to Nikon's own D90/D5000.  This thing is built like a tank, it's tough and will last you for years to come unless you throw it in the middle of a highway.  It's shoots more frames per second then I will ever need, but if you're serious about sports photography this camera is for you.  The image quality is best in it's class.  Compared to the Canon 7D the Nikon D300s gives sharper pictures with less noise and great detail over iso 400.  The 7D photos to my eye looked too \"digital\" and processed.  Where the D300s always gives a natural film like quality to it's images.  The color, contrast, sharpness, and exposure all seem much better to me on the D300s than the 7D.Then only downside to this camera is the video.  Like all DSLRs that can shoot video, it can't auto-focus while shooting making it useless for all but the most hardcore video experts and film makers.  It also suffers from \"rolling shutter\" while shooting video, but I don't really care because I don't buy picture camera to shoot video, I buy them to take pictures.

I would say that the only downfall is the high ISO performance, although for an APS-C sensor it does very well it is still an APS-C sensor and thus has limitations at higher ISO.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent D300s", "Author": "Connie Tam", "ReviewID": "RBZFEF4ZHSIIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have upgraded from d90 due to the dual card capability and the faster frame per second.

Very impressed. Aside from the sensor size / ratio difference, the image quality appears comparable with the D700. Heck, it performs so much like the D700, I get the 2 confused sometimes.The unfortunate drawback is the video capabilities. Awful, considering the times. Nikon shouldn't have even bothered coming out with this \"s\" version. My tiny point and shoot camera does a better job of handling video.I'll stick to only shooting photos, with which Nikon does excel.A bit about the video capabilities:Nikon chose to use motion jpeg for the video codec: although more compatible for editing purposes, it is more compressed and picks up more image \"artifacts\". And only 720p? Come on! With Nikon's amazing glass and beautiful imaging chip, what a waste! You might as well be shooting with a point and shoot body.Video autofocus  is a joke. We took 2 steps backwards in AF technology. I know, I know, I'm aware you cannot piggy-back off the photo still AF system during live view video capture, thus having to use a secondary \"contrast detection\" system. But video camera manufacturers have already found solutions a long time ago. Nikon needed to look to them and taken some time to apply it in their DSLRs rather than rush slap it in, just to jump on the HD video bandwagon early on.You can always manually focus. (How most hollywood films are shot) Very difficult to hold steady while trying to focus / zoom / track while recording. Your success will be dependent on how well you can track, pull focus, etc. For which you'll need an external monitor or screen magnifier. Basically, I am limited to very static shots.The \"jello effect\" is terrible. Try quickly panning sideways, you'll see what I mean. (There are some good examples on youtube\"Built in mic sound is atrocious. But that is to be expected. Easily remedied by using a good external mic.Yes you can get some great \"cinema style\" shallow depth of field shots, and shoot low light and such, but that's because of the lens choices and DSLR form factor. As for the actual video quality: very poor and way behind.All in all, if you are looking for the best still DSLR in this price range, The D300s is it. If you are looking for good video capabilities as well, look at the Canons. Right now, Nikon has little to no experience in the video world. They are stepping into Canon territory: With which they excel.

Why go back to $2300 now??? A measley 13% discount. How much warehouse dust does it need to collect while someone waits for some sucker to call and buy it?My first Nikon was a D40x with an 18-135mm no VR. A D40-X (WOW) with the same walk around lens Nikon had kitted with the D70 earlier. Heaven forbid I might have ever run into Ken Rockwell on the Ocean Beach pier holding that ridiculous combo.I hesitated to buy it, paid way too much for it -- and definitely regretted it later. It was finally stolen from my trunk, and I hope it etches acid burns into any hands that might ever hold it going forward.The D300s isn't as nice as the newer D7000, however at a reasonable price - around $1800, even kitted with the 70-300mm VR II lens - it's a way better deal than it was new  and at such a reasonable price with the 18-200mm or 70-300mm VR II lenses, one could justify the step up from a D90 with an 18-105mm kit lens, even if you never take one crappy video or shoot one football game.The D300s is an arguably serious \"prosumer\" camera.

I made some shots already with my D3100's Tamron 18-270 and Nikkor 35 prime, both of which are giving me great results.I sure will be doing more business with you and  endorse you with my friends.Willie", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera produce quality photos but price...", "Author": "Nguyen Xuan Hoa \"Thelevels\"", "ReviewID": "R3K2I3T4QURPQ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from Amazon & returned it back after two weeks because it failed to accept CF cards (only accepts SDHC cards) with full refund including shipping fees for both ways.In general, this is a great CROP 1.5x camera in the field. It produces very fine and clean quality photos and video(with good optical lenses, I always use fix lenses); really amazing if you do video - very high quality! easier to control the video mode (if compare to other models of Nikon or Canon, even the 5D mark II).The only two things i am not so happy with:1) the ISO sensitivity - it's true that the ISO sensitivity is better & an improvement if compare to previous models (D200, D300) - however, it doesn't meet my expectations for $1.8K value camera. with ISO over 800, you  start seeing noises. If you don't like noises, it's better option to buy D700 or any full-frame cameras.2)The price - I bought it $1800 on Amazon. It seems Nikon get too much from a 1.5x CROP camera. I personally think this is not a good price for the value. I returned the camera after two weeks & will save some extra to buy the D700 instead.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "get it new", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R2Z05EI1RM72Q7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Y would you buy a used Nikon D300s at there price when you can get a brand new one from Nikon for the $1699", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera Has One Big Problem", "Author": "dennis", "ReviewID": "RRLKL1N9OQXQM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this body only as I already had several Nikon lenses.

Sending it to Nikon all the time is expensive and you loose the use of the camera for an extended period of time.

When the d300 was released it was maybe the best Cropped Sensor camera on the market, but it was 2007 fall... I thought that Nikon People will work on the weak points of the camera for the next release, but they didn't,If the d300s  could retain its 7 FPS at 14 bit RAW; increase its sensor definition without increase noise and include for free the NX2 and Control Camera Pro, this camera series maybe have keeps  as best  buy  APS-C  sensor camera, or at least  stay in the top together with the Canon's 7d.Nevertheless the history is different, the competence learn on the success of Nikon and include as it owns some of the best characteristics of Nikon High end bodies (Truly sturdy  body, very well controlled chroma noise, improved ergonomics (not as good as nikon ones, but improved) External Flash controller with the pop up flash (3 groups vs Nikon just two) built in level projected both, finder and back display, and... maybe the best Cropped Sensor made to date.The d300s I bought, still have a pair of extras but only one works fine: the Twin card slot is a joy to use, on the other hand the \"Q\" mode on the selector must be:  \"JALQ\" (Just A Little Quieter) which describes literally how it works.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Defective?", "Author": "E. Bogusch \"erbii\"", "ReviewID": "R19NDHZWBEW8H5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just received my brand new Nikon D300S from Amazon.  I bought a new CF card (SanDisk Extreme III SCDFX3 8GB) at a local retailer ($69.99 + tax).  I inserted the card and attempted to format it.  It won't format.  Instead, I got a \"CHA\" error on the control panel and the following error message displayed on the monitor: \"This memory card cannot be used - Card may be damaged - Insert another card\".  So, being the fool that I am, I went out and bought another CF card (another $54.99 + tax), this time a SanDisk Ultra SDCFH card...with the exact same results.  I also inserted an old SD card that I had, which at least allows me to take some pictures.  I have found no useful help on this in the little research I've done so far.  The manual that came with the camera (specifically, on page 382) doesn't provide much help.  I'm supposed to \"Use a Nikon-approved card.\"  Check.  I'm supposed to \"Delete files or insert new memory card.\"  There were no files to delete because I used new memory cards.  Then I'm supposed to \"Check that contacts are clean.\"  Huh?  How do you do that?  But why would the contacts on a brand new camera not be clean anyway?  I'm rating the camera \"Don't like it\" until/unless I find out that I'm doing something wrong.  I'll be happy to amend my rating if someone can tell me how to rectify the situation, hopefully without having to return it for a replacement.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Marcela", "ReviewID": "R3QG2QH2OGN3D7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very disappointed about my purchase. Due to the low price, I review several times the link because I want to make sure the camera was in good condition, also  I wrote to Susan (the seller), and the answer was: \"the camera is in excellent condition\". I knew the manufacturer's warranty was no longer available, but due to the fact that was a Nikon, offer by Amazon and the owner response, I decided buy it. I got my camera just on time for a huge event. My first surprise was the built in flash doesn't fire, also the 18 200 lens, was not soft, it was hard to zoom and the lens blocked up. I brought my camera and lenses to the Nikon authorized dealer in Colombia and they told me the built in flash is not working and the lens had been repaired. I am aware that amazon is not responsible, but it is not admissible that a third one through amazon sell a camera as in perfect conditions  when it is not working and had have problems I will tell you that an old camera in those conditions is expensive even free!

I am very sorry I purchased mine at the end of September 2009. Bought from Amazon.com.As a Nikon CoolPix 8700 user, I thought that the D300S would be a good step up to improve picture quality and use of a wider range of lighting options.I have two SB 800 and one SB 900 SpeedLights and looked forward to using the D300S for basically portrait type work shooting Linen clothing items on dummy stands.Was I wrong. The focus capability on the D300S is simply awful. Maybe my camera is defective but so very difficult to tell with so many options to adjust.Even my Cannon PowerShoot S2 takes a clearer picture than the D300SI am now one month and over 50 to 60 hours of working with the D300S with almost no improvement.Every once and a while I will get a decent shot but almost impossible to repeat it or get three in a row of the same quality.I am now using the Camera Control PRO software with some success but still not good enough.By the way, It took 6 hours to figure out thet the version of the Camera Control pro software that you download does not work with the D300S. You have to download and install version 2.60 before the software will recognize the camera.I have tried the video a couple of times and it worked reasonably OK - no jitter as others have mentioned on normal pan speeds. But the quality is no better and maybe not as good as my Canon PowerShot S2.So bottom line... Think twice before you purchase a Nikon D300SThere is NO VALUE here.Is a Canon any better? Not sure, but I have several friends who quickly tell me that their Canon's work out of the bag without all the adjustment hassle..", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002JCSV7G"}}
