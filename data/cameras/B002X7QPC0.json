{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great camera!", "Author": "esra7", "ReviewID": "RRCOVSWFSGNG0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although this camera looks a little big and old fashioned from the outside, it takes amazing photos. I loved using it and had it for about 3 years. I especially loved how the photos came out without flash. My only complaint is that it just stopped working recently out of nowhere, however i liked this camera so much that i plan on buying the same camera if i can find a good deal.

If you are taking a picture of something up close it's fine, but the zoom is terrible. Also, they are selling it on amazon for $175??????? THAT'S CRAZY. DO NOT EVER SPEND THAT ON THIS CAMERA. YOU CAN GET MUCH BETTER. This only has 3x optical zoom. Not very good. I'm buying myself the Panasonic Lumix ZS8 right now. I am VERY excited! If your giving this to a 12 year old it's good, cause that's when I got it.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "1/2.5\" CCD; 9.2 megapixels\n3x optical, 5x digital zooms\n2.4\" LCD", "Name": "KODAK EasyShare CD93 9.2MP Digital Camera- Blue", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516MpGVuiFL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002X7QPC0"}}
