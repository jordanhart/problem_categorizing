{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Poor quality of range longer than 20 feet", "Author": "Gerald M. Deslauriers \"dog lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3VNBH9JZ6XLTT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this item and initially installed the camera and receiver only 15 feet apart in separate rooms. The reception quality was fair to good. Then I moved the receiver to another TV about 20 feet away separated by brick and wallboard. The reception is very very poor! I would advise spending a little more and purchasing a unit with better long range reception. Also the way the camera is mounted it does not adjust to angle changes very good.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent product", "Author": "Adam Wood", "ReviewID": "R3VQIGDNSQNNRW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product is decent for the price.is has  a short range of 100 feet and you have to tune in the camera manuallybut all in all if you need a cheap wireless camera to go from room to room it will work", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "NOT A GOOD CHOICE", "Author": "jesuisfemme1", "ReviewID": "R2E950YPK12FJ1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "VIDEO & sound QUALITY is very poor close range and long range.

I hardly made it past 50 feet before I started to lose the signal. You definitely get what you pay for, that is one reason I gave it a three star rating. Had it been more pricey, I would have shipped it back and given it at most one star.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Micro 2.4 GHz Wireless Camera", "Author": "John A.

I have the electronic experience to make an antenna.When I tested this unit I found the video to be such low quality it was useless. The receiver tuning was touchy, much like tuning a regenerative receiver (1940's technology)  This unit is a POS and I returned it for a refund.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera for a robot, worked ok", "Author": "Eltopia", "ReviewID": "R2230NE9JPLSUV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this for a robotics class, the range in a wide open space was 200-300 feet and indoors was about 50 (thick masonry and steel cabinets ). it required re-tuning often as our project moved around. It seams to be very susceptible to interference from other 2.5 Ghz band items, our controllers would make a horizontal band in the video and WiFi signals some times dropped out when this was operating. Signal was often very poor with a low battery (it will drain a 9 volt quickly) and would sometimes require re-tuning after replacing the battery(worked fine plugged in with power supply it came with). It worked for what we needed and for the price it was the right item.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works perfect", "Author": "Jeffrey R.

The picture is almost as good as my $125 cameras (which do not have a wireless sending unit). The box that comes with this camera can pick up other wireless cameras if you use the dial on the end of it. They work non-stop in freezing weather.
