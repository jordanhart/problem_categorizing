{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK for a budget level camera...", "Author": "Lost Cause", "ReviewID": "R3FIWUC0NW4JZ0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was looking for a Christmas gift - requirements were: $80 range, name brand, OK quality, and 720p video recording.  I had a $20 gift card leftover for a certain retailer, so decided to pick this up.  Since the camera is rather new, I wasn't able to find much reviews on it prior to purchasing.  I'm hoping this will help out others who are debating on whether to buy or not.The camera isn't the tiniest I've seen, but it's still fairly small.  The body does feel like cheap plastic, but it's acceptable for a budget camera.  On the bright side, the cheaper plastic has made the camera fairly light.  Battery took a few hours to charge (it charges inside the camera with the AC adapter plugged in).  Lens does come out rather quick - not much lag time to get it to extend.  External buttons are plain and simple.  Unfortunately, there isn't a physical button to switch into the different camera modes or to go into video mode.  You have to go through the menu options which can be quite a pain - especially if you're in a hurry to catch a shot or take a video.I'm used to using Canons, so the menu seemed a bit confusing at first, but it'll just take a little time to adjust to.  Took a few indoor shots in somewhat dim lighting - they turned out OK, although the objects in the background were a bit hazy.  Shots aren't great, but they're acceptable for the casual/light photo user.  I did take a video, but haven't had a chance to review.  In reviewing the video on the camera, the quality seemed acceptable, but pretty hard to tell unless I view it on a computer.Overall, it's an OK camera for the price paid.  However, if you're able to find a Sony or Canon on sale for a slightly higher price, I might go for that instead.  The JX370 just fit my price range and came with a case & 4GB SD card which made it a convenient gift package for me.  Not something I would use personally, but it makes a decent gift for the novice user.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Corvette \"Terry\"", "ReviewID": "R4O6PQJNLJCHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned many Fuji cameras over the years...and they are still my favorites.  This Camera is not only everything it advertises to be but has surprised me at every turn. The battery life is incredible by comparison to other digital cameras I have purchased in the past.Picture quality has been above expectations for every shot including scenic views on a trip to Alaska. I recommend this camera highly!", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice pocket camera with a major flaw", "Author": "James T", "ReviewID": "R2HTTUMCJ2B72H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This a nice little pocket camera.  It is so slim it fits nicely in my pants pocket. Picture quality is acceptable.  There are times when the camera in my phone is just not good enough.  I would have preferred a rotating dial to select the different picture modes; it's a bit of a pain to switch from still to video, for example.  The competition here is a cellphone camera: there I have a simple one-click that switches video to camera and back.The biggest negative, and one that will prevent me from choosing this camera in the future- is the proprietary USB/power plug.  In this day and age, where there are good standardized plugs available, there is no excuse for them inventing yet another iteration on a small receptacle with 4 pins.  This is very old-skool thinking (\"we can make money selling replacement cables!\"), and needs to be resoundly rejected by the user community.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$149.99", "Features": "2.7\" Display Size\nBlack\n5x Zoom\n14.0 MP", "Name": "Fujifilm JX370 14.0 MP Digital Camera - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BMcOjVByL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006GI2YXQ"}}
