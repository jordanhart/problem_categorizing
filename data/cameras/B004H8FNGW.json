{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DETAILED COMPARISON OF SONY TX10 to Panasonic TS3", "Author": "SammiMur", "ReviewID": "R2UE60W48OXQA4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, some background on what I was looking for:  I'm a casual photographer.  I wanted a waterproof camera which would produce high-quality photos in all settings (indoor, outdoor, and underwater.  My intention was to completely replace my 7.2MP Sony DSC-W7, which I LOVE.  I wanted to add the underwater feature without compromising on other features.  I did not want to spend more than about $400 for everything (camera, two 8GB memory cards (Class 10), two extra batteries with charger, and float strap.  This left me with about $340 max to spend on the camera itself.  I do NOT know a lot about photography.  Terms like \"ISO\" and \"white balance\" are foreign to me.  I like to use pre-programmed scene modes and auto features.  I enjoy digital scrapbooking and I frequently zoom and crop.  It takes a very high quality photo to crop out/enlarge a small figure without too much distortion.I began my search online and spent about 6 hours researching the cameras in my price range.  The cameras I focused on most were the Canon D10, Sony TX10, Panasonic TS3 (sometimes referred to as FT3), Olympus TG-810, Olympus Tough 8010, Fujifilm XP30, and Pentax WG-1.I eliminated most of these options rather quickly based on their reviews, overall ratings, and the quality of photos that I reviewed.  I narrowed my focus to the Canon D10, the Sony TX10, and the Panasonic TS3.I wanted to love the Canon D10, since it seems to be the overwhelming fan favorite, but I ultimately decided that it wasn't going to be a good fit for me.  The price of the D10 is similar to the Sony and the Panasonic, but it's a 2.5 year old model which doesn't have HD video.  The photo quality seemed about equivalent to the other two, so I decided to only focus on the two models with HD video.I would have been completely sold on the Sony, since I've used only Sony cameras most of my adult life and I've never been disappointed in one; however, there were some notable deficiencies which most reviewers found with this model (detailed below), so I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge.  The Sony was also priced near the top of my budget ($329), whereas the Panasonic was only $275 at Amazon.com.  The Panasonic reviews seemed to all be very positive, with the only significantly commonly-noted problem being lower quality indoor photos.  However, all of the indoor, outdoor, and underwater photos that I reviewed online looked very good.I decided to take a chance on the Panasonic TS3 and I really, really, wanted to fall in love with it.  I ordered it from Amazon and they delivered it the next day.  I wasn't blown away by this camera.  The outdoor photos were good.  The video was very good.  The underwater photos (taken in my large fish tank) were very good.  The indoor photos were POOR.  I decided to order the Sony TX10, hoping that I'd see better results.  I ordered it from Amazon at 9pm that night and it was delivered at 1:00pm the next day (gotta love Amazon!).  The photo quality of the Sony camera is outstanding.  I'll be keeping the Sony TX10!!!  For some people, however, the Panasonic might be the better choice.First, I'll provide my overall recommendations, then I'll add in all of the detail:BUY THE SONY TX10 IF:You value the quality of the photos/video above all else.You like touch screen devices.You don't plan to dive lower than 16 feet.You don't care if you can't adjust your settings (other than zoom) underwater.You want a VERY small camera.You always use a wrist strap.BUY THE PANASONIC TS3 IF:You can live with grainy indoor photos.You don't typically enlarge your photos to 100% (because they will be distorted).You want a camera with GPS.You plan to dive deeper than 16 feet.You want a larger (but not too big) camera.You're looking for a less expensive option.NOW FOR MY DETAILED COMMENTS ON BOTH MODELS:PRICE - The Sony is +/- $50 more expensive than the Panasonic.SIZE - The Sony is significantly smaller and lighter than the Panasonic.  I don't think one is better than the other, per se.  It's a matter of personal preference.  The Sony will fit in most pockets.  The Panasonic probably wouldn't.RUGGEDNESS - Both cameras are rated very well in this area.  I haven't \"tested\" them, but it seems like the Panasonic is built a bit tougher and would be less likely to get destroyed in a fall.  Rather than test this feature, I'm going to just trust the experts that either one will hold up well if dropped.UPDATE:  I also posted this review on another site and I recently added photos to it.

When I received this product, I was anxious to see how it would hold up. I charged the battery and placed it in its protective slot, I was off to put it to the test. I wanted to try it in the pool before I used it at the lake or on our upcoming caribbean cruise. I switched it to underwater mode and it told me to check that all the openings were closed and sealed. I checked the openings and in the pool I went. (3 feet deep at the deepest) Needless to say it crashed and burned on its maiden voyage. The screen started to flicker and after about a minute of being scrambled, it died! Never to work again. Like others that have had issues with this camera and the Sony \"customer care\" Sony refuses to replace let alone refund my money due to water damage. I wouldn't have a problem with that if it was my fault that the camera malfunctioned. My experience with this camera and Sony leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

It was not heavily used when the 1 year warranty expired and a week later a piece broke off of the lower right corner of the body. It was an unprovoked and not neglected. I did some research and this happens frequently with this camera. After sending it into the company they said that it would be a $250 repair, that they couldn't just replace that one piece, it had to be a full repair (meaning that every little time I scratched it, they used it against me).  I had heard horror stories about the company and customer service, but we remained loyal customers, until today.  I am extremely disappointed, and regret the day I made this purchase.

I was attracted by its compactness, lens, and touch screen.The pictures this camera took was pure crap.  During my trip, there was nothing but sunshine with little cloud coverage.  The pics taken on intelligent mode were overblown and could not be fixed.  It absolutely refuses to dial down the exposure on its own.  The metering on this camera is awful and white balance was all over the place.  I was in both the jungle and the beaches and had to put the camera in Program mode and manually adjust the settings in order to take any decent photos.  However its low light performance is superb and underwater photographs were crisp.  The layout is intuitive, but the preview button is in an awkward position.The camera takes 7 seconds from turning on till its ready to shoot.  Way too long as compared to its competitors.  Its sliding door is finicky at times and will require both hands to slide down.  The touch screen is nice, but it is unusable underwater.  It also gets covered with fingerprints over the course of the day and does not make for a pleasant viewing area for your photos.I also had the cracking issue on the upper and lower right side of the camera, by the power button.  The camera was not dropped in any shape or form so I was quite surprised by it.  As such I could not use it for underwater photos anymore.I actually liked the phone in green because it stands out quite a bit.  You cannot miss spotting the camera wherever its lying.  Some might say that will attract thieves, but I think it might deter them.  Who's going to steal a day glow green camera and think they can get away with it?This camera sets high expectations and fails in most categories.  I like the design and layout, but as a camera, it was just useless.  Its just too slow, too inaccurate, and too gimmicky to compete in this price range.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great idea but not up to claims by Sony", "Author": "Ron Paul for press!", "ReviewID": "R29C8ZAALRNL1T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Love the idea of this small waterproof camera BUT after taking it into the ocean and shooting pictures and videos something happened.

However, after I used it for a couple of months, and, got used to its features, I decided that five stars was more appropriate.My first \"point and shoot\" is an ancient SONY DSC T33 (5.1 Mp) Sony Cybershot DSCT33 5.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Includes Docking Station) I bought about five years ago.  It is a little beat up, but, it has worked really well, and, continues to work really well.  I love it.  I wouldn't have bought a new camera except I misplaced it for a few months and needed a new one.This camera DSC-TX10, provides three times the resolution, and I am really happy with the higher resolution.  It's hard to take a bad picture because, with the high resolution, you can electronically crop most photos into award-winning pictures, and the remaining cropped image still has plenty of resolution.This is a camera you can stick in your pocket, and, take with you, all the time.  It is compact, lightweight, sturdy enough to take jolts, bumps and an occasional fall.  You can keep it in \"easy mode\" for almost instant \"point and shoots\", and, it will stay in easy mode until you exit into the more complicated functions.  I cherish the simplicity.  I have 22 years of education, and, many years of technical experience.  I am no \"technophobe\".  However, as I mature, I find my life bleeding away and I don't want to spend it buried in technical manuals for gadgest that are supposed to be enhancing my life, and, giving me more time for important things.This camera does the job.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this Camera!", "Author": "juspain", "ReviewID": "R37C6SL7COJUHT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read lots of reviews on this camera before buying it, and half of them scared the hell out of me thinking that this waterproof camera wasn't going to be able to hack my vacation to the Caribbean.Those other peeps must have had a lot of misfortune, cause I used it exactly like the instructions say, and needless to say, I still have a full functioning waterproof camera after swimming around in the Caribbean and island hoping for 10 days.I liked all the features on this camera more than the others out there, so that is why I bought it.I swam around with this camera in my pocket, took lots of underwater pics and videos. My pictures turned out amazing, and everyone in my group was super jealous of my sleek looking camera, and the waterproof-ability of it.Never had a single problem with it.My only complaint about this camera is that the functions are way slow compared to other cameras.

I see there are a lot of people complaining the camera is not waterproof.  So I decided to test out the waterproof effectiveness before my 30 day return policy ended.  I filled my bathtub full of water, took pictures underwater & left it there for two hours.  The pictures came out perfect & my camera was still working after submerging it for 2 hours.  Maybe the camera might act differently out in the real world, buy under control situation, it worked fine.

The only problem is that once not using it in the water, there are water spots on the lens, which come through in all my average pics. I had bought this to be an all purpose everyday pocket camera, but unfortunately it just became an expensive water camera. I love the panoramic feature, but can't find any place by me that is capable of printing such sizes, so have to have them special ordered online. The video camera works well but it is a little tricky as it does not start or start exactly when you push the button, so if you are trying to tape something on the spur, that is impossible!!

There are plenty of reviews here with highly technical info, so I'll cover the basic pros and cons from my own experience.  After owning it over a year I have a pretty good handle on what I do, and don't like.Pros*It's uber small, I can easily fit it in my pocket/purse/hand ect and it basically disappears.  As a result I find myself taking it a lot of places I wouldn't take even a slightly larger camera*Battery life is pretty decent, especially with non-Canon brand replacements it seems. I live in the extreme arctic, and keeping my camera warm is imperative, at -50 your batteries die mighty quick, so the size is even more important to me. With zero battery conservation I can easily go on one battery for a day, I always take a spare, but rarely need it, and I take a lot of pictures (750 a day?)*I have tested the waterproof capabilities and they seem great to me.  I've followed to the letter the post submerged instructions and have never had any issues with leaks.  I think it's IMPERATIVE people follow these instructions, especially when it's been in salt water.*Picture Quality: Phenomenal, low light is great, the sweep panorama is nothing less than totally awesome.  Now granted, my expensive DSLR will obviously take higher quality pictures, but for a P&S; waterproof camera....it doesn't get much better. I have been nothing short of highly impressed with the quality.Cons*Sometimes the touch screen has a life of it's own, it will be unresponsive sometimes, and to responsive others.  If I don't pay attention and it's on in my pocket I'll have \"touched\" my way to some random screen before I know what's going on.  On other times (it seems especially prevalent when trying to switch to playback mode) the icon won't respond.  I'll have to turn the camera on and back on again for it to work.*About 6 months into owning it the plastic housing around the touch screen started to crack out on the corners. I did NOT drop the camera or mis-handle it in any way.  After reading some online forums I found this was a semi-common problem although Canon hadn't issued a recall for it.  I sent the unit in for warranty work, and I prepared myself for a fight since I'd heard nightmare stories about warranty repair.  To my pleasant surprise I recd the unit back, fully repaired, and no cost, in less than a week with no questions asked.*It is annoying Canon doesn't ship an external charging unit with this camera.  Without purchasing it seperate you're forced to charge your battery in camera, rendering it unavailable during this time.  Since sooner or later every user will need an external charger I would think they would up the price by $10 and include on.  That being said, you can easily purchase one, for cheap.Overall I've been very satisfied with this camera.  It's not perfect, but I would purchase it again.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE CAMERA; HORRIBLE SUPPORT", "Author": "Ping Porsche", "ReviewID": "R33CU1Y9TE9DS2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "WHY CAN'T I GIVE NEGATIVE STARS?DON'T BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER SONY CAMERA!!!!!Sony makes crap cameras and their support will accuse you of breaking it.Purchase from a respectable camera maker like Canon, Nikon, or Fuji.I bought this for snorkeling and it corrupted my memory card on the first trip.OK, $10,000 trip with no pictures, because the camera corrupted the memory.Called Sony and they blamed the memory.Got two new memory cards for the next trip.OK, new trip, $5k trip with no pictures because the entire stupid camera craps out.Called Sony, no apologies, no emergency loaner, just a send it in with the receipt so we can verify it's still under warranty.Sent the camera in to the depot, on my own dime.They call and accused me of opening the camera door.What idiots!

The auto mode really works on the Sony whereas it was hit and miss on the Nikon.Updated on July 4 2012:  This camera does excellent under water.  Sound and picture exceed my expectations.  My friends are impressed, and they want to buy one like this.  I bought mine from one of those Amazon 1 day deals for less than 200 dollars.  I see that it is now (July 4 2012) selling for $399!

It feels solid but not heavy, it's slim but not tiny, for a non-SLR camera I'd say it's a great machine. This is our second Sony Cyber-Shot camera and our first waterproof camera.

I give 4 stars only because I have not yet tried the waterproof function.  The video is incredibly sharp, great sound and has the option of taking stills while recording.  Easy to use touch screen (which can also be \"locked\" so you don't accidentally change settings).  Camera quickly starts up when you slide open the front cover, no need to press on button.  The menus and many different scene selections are very simple to use and understand with a built in instruction manual in the menu as well.  I did put a cell phone screen protector on the touch screen to protect it from scratches etc.  This camera is also fantastic in low light conditions.  My last camera was very poor in low light so this really stands out for me.  As for waterproofing, there are rubber gaskets on the two covers that open.  The buttons to open these are small and recessed so I don't think they would accidentally be opened underwater unless they had not been closed tightly to begin with.  I used it yesterday in conditions below freezing and it performed well, battery life was good and the pictures turned out great.

Wedenoja", "ReviewID": "R33Z08FFC9FPPU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for one major purpose - to take pictures for research in a boat at sea - but I thought it would also be useful for rugged outdoor use in general, particularly hiking and field archaeology. It is water-resistant but after reading a number of reviews I didn't have enough confidence to take it into the ocean, particularly as it would be a hassle to clean off the salt water according to directions. Still, it was nice to know that it would probably survive splashes and even rain. It is also supposedly rugged, and it will get kicked around in a boat, or on a trail, or at an archaeological site. And probably relatively dust-proof as well. One major liability is that I found it almost impossible to see anything in the screen in bright sunlight (unlike my Canon S95). I just had to point in the general direction and hope for the best. Another big problem is that the lens is at the top right corner. I naturally put my left hand there and often got a piece of finger in the corner of my pictures. The camera is small and light and has virtually no protuberances, making it slick to hold but also easy to slide into a front pants pocket. The touchscreen interface is simple to learn and use, but sketchy to the touch - sometimes too sensitive, other times not enough. Finally, indoor shots are nowhere near as good as my Canon S95. I should add that the color of the body is unique and difficult to like. If you are looking for a good point-and-shoot then this is overpriced. Get it only if you need something rugged - water-resistant, dust-proof, and impact-resistant - and won't be using it in bright sun.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "For the money - superstar beach camera", "Author": "P.

Every model that I have looked at from the cheapest to a $1,000 slr manufactured by Sony people have a red tint to the skin tones.  When you snap the picture and look at your new photo on the camera, people still have a red tint.  Here's the kicker, when you download the photo and view them on a computer they look great, no more red tint.  I have a 5 years old Sony DSC-W100 that takes great pictures and what I see on the LCD monitor is the same picture I see after I snap the picture and after I download it to the computer.  I don't know what's going on with Sony but this is totally unacceptable.  When I take the picture I don't know if what I just took is a bad pic or what.  This TX10 is no different and that's why I sent it back.  If it weren't for this HUGE problem I would have kept the camera but I can't deal with the \"red tint\" problem.  Oh yeah, one other thing, I posted a picture of what this camera really looks like.  From the photo on Amazon it look pretty yellow to me but it's not and it's not green but an iridescent mix of green/yellow, kinda ugly to me.  Oh, one other thing the camera that I used to take the \"real\" picture of the TX10 was taken by my Sony DSC-W100.
