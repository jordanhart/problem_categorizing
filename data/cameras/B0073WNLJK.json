Eight years ago I bought my first digital Kodak camera and I have enjoyed it tremendously. There are a couple of things I don't like about the camera, but its me I just need to use it a little more and learn more about it's features. It is a great size, fits in the palm of your hand, fits inside your chest-shirt pocket. It is extremely slim fitting an takes up no room at all in your purse. I print my photo's myself and the images are great. Buy a Kodak digital camera you can't go wrong.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Kodak EasyShare Digital Camera 16MP 2.7\" LCD [Turquoise]", "Name": "Kodak Easyshare M5350 16 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Green)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Kb6QbsZoL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0073WNLJK"}}
