{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Little Camera!", "Author": "D. Barba \"Diane The Postal Worker\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q50ZZ2AB72EI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera from an online shopping site for much less with 5 easy pays....but it's well worth the price. My Kodak had a 12x zoom but was bulky and I always had to carry a camera case. The photos are clear and the best I've taken with digital (this is my 3rd camera). It's small size is easy to pack in a purse with no case (the lens closes within the camera). It has so many features that weren't available in other cameras (like the Magic settings). I like the fact that you can edit photos right within the camera, then load them onto the pc. There is a beauty fix feature that can soften faces, accentuate the eyes. The battery charges in the camera and has an extremely long life between charges.I would recommend this highly at any price.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005EUU1I2"}}
