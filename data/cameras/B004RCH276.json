Also, this DOES NOT COME WITH 18-55MM LENS!! From product description and photo it looks like it would come with it, the one on the camera. I called them twice only to be told \"you got two other lenses, so what\". And the accessories are a lower end quality, yet still do it's purpose. Was not happy with the sellers, but am happy with the product, for what it came with.Canon EOS Rebel T3 (1100d) SLR Digital Camera W/tamron 28-80mm & 75-300mm Lens, 3 Extra Lens, Hdmi Cable, 8gb Sdhc Memory Card, Soft Carrying Cases, Hdmi Cable, Tripod & Much More !!", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.00", "Features": "12.2MP APS-C CMOS Sensor, SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card Slot\nDIGIC 4 Imaging Processor, 2.7\" Clear View LCD\nFull HD Movie Mode, 100-6400 ISO\nCompatible with Canon EF and EF-S Lenses, 63 Zone Dual-Layer System / 9 Point AF\n3 fps Continuous Shooting, Basic + Function / Creative Auto", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T3 (1100d) SLR Digital Camera W/tamron 28-80mm & 75-300mm Lens, 3 Extra Lens, Hdmi Cable, 8gb Sdhc Memory Card, Soft Carrying Cases, Hdmi Cable, Tripod & Much More !!", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61-Xn%2Bhe4JL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004RCH276"}}
