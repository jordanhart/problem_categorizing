This one was a gift, but my decision to purchase it was based upon my satisfaction with the original one I own. I bought a Nikon D5100 for a gift, but after looking at it and comparing it to my T3i, I returned the Nikon and bought the Canon. The Canon seems to have a better selection of lenses and the focus motor is built in to the camera and not the lens.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with my purchase", "Author": "Ruby G Baldwin", "ReviewID": "R2O8CFHI4OPLSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this as a Christmas gift you sure can not beat the price for all that you get with this bundle.
