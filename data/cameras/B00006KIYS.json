These are the reasons I think it's great:1) It has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want.2) It is easy enough for my grandmother to use.3) It is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they're still easy to use.4) It has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms.5) For \"digital film\" it uses Compact Flash cards, which are easy to find, cheap, reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome.6) The Nikon Coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when Nikon releases a newer model.7) Picture quality is excellent.8) Battery life is excellent.9) 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range.10) Great price for all the features.Here's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera:1) No direct firewire to the camera. There is USB, though.2) The camera is so small that when you attach some lenses (I have the 19mm wide-angle--WC-E68), the optical viewfinder is partially obscured. This doesn't affect the picture, of course. You just have to use the LCD viewfinder to see the whole picture. It's no problem for me personally.3) Battery has to be removed to recharge.4) An AC adapter for powering the camera while the battery's out is not included, although one can be purchased separately.5) Two different adapters--UR-E4 and UR-E7--are required for some attachment lenses.... Most of these \"annoyances\", though, are comparable to what you'll find on other cameras in this price range.", "Date": "December 2, 2002"}, {"Title": "Absolutely great point and shoot camera", "Author": "Par4DaCourse", "ReviewID": "R25HC4O7G9TSLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, let's start with my needs: (1) $500 budget (2)4mp resolution, (3) optical clarity and color, (4)fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture, (5)compact size, and (6) good camera grip to minimize camera shake. For three months, I've researched the internet and magazines, queried various sales personnel, and took hands-on in-store test drives. And I finally settled on the Nikon Coolpix 4300.I have it for a week now, and this camera has exceeded my expectations. The daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away. The shutter lag is on par with what I've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and APS film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128MB compact flash card (a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only [a few dollars] more). Uploading the images to my Windows-based PC is very fast and simple.The only drawbacks I've encountered are: (1)indoor shots from a distance (>8ft) lack contrast and color, but I've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that I've used (even on a Nikon SLR). Right now, I'm researching for an inexpensive ... slave flash unit that's designed for digital cameras. (2) The battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations. I got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on (turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period) before the battery died. An extra [$$$] for a back-up battery would be a good investment. (3)The picture editing software it came with is adequate, but not very robust. I'll still use my PhotoSuite for editing.One more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing. Just for the heck of it, I took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door, and the focusing was just fine.In summary, I love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the [medium] price range.(June 2003 - Since I wrote the review above in January 2003, I still love this camera.  I've picked up a few accessories that I found to be useful.  I bought a Digi-Slave DSF-1s flash unit.  I don't use a bracket, I just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand.  I also got a UR-E4 Step Down Ring Adapter, LC-E900 lens cap, and the Nikon 28mm filter set.  This provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters.  I leave the adapter and UV filter on all the time.  This also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap.  The downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on, the camera won't fit in the small cases, and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find.)", "Date": "January 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "Perfect to grow into", "Author": "Mihir Joshi", "ReviewID": "R2UWMIHW5VOU1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my camera three days back, and although I had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one, I still rate myself as a beginner. I bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive.It's easy to use, and yet very feature rich. In the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click, the Scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results. The manual mode is feature rich and I can't wait to get the hang of it. The macro mode is exceptional, the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject. The battery life is very good, I got about 90 minutes with the LCD turned on all the time, the first time around, and I have been using it with the LCD off every now and then, and have yet needed to recharge it.

The manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain.

I first intended to buy the 3100, but am really happy to invest the extra [money] for the 4300. The lense is a lot better, and the 4MB produce fantastic pictures.The possibilities with auto, manual, and the very helpful \"scene\" mode, which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait, landscape, beach/snow, sunset etc., are endless. The movie mode is also working great.The 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software (I use it on XP and Win98 without problem), battery charger, USB and video cable. A 64MB flash card (camera comes with a 16MB) holds 52 pictures on \"normal\" resolution. I experimented with online print ordering with the two major US brick and mortar retailers, and they both delivered great results. Even at the \"normal\" setting, a 8x10 print (!) shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a \"digital\".The battery life is ok, but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on. I therefore bought a second battery as a backup, and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger, which by the way works on 110V as well as 220V in Europe, we ran never out of \"juice\".I highly recommend the accessory kit, which provides you with everything else you need: A nice camera bag, which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger. Furher it contains a card reader, a flash card folder for up to 8 cards, a lense cleaning rag, and an AC adapter, which is very helpful when working in an \"outlet environment\".Over all a fantastic very compact camera, which made us experience photography on a totally new level!", "Date": "May 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent little camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R7J0PNIHJNIUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before buying this camera, and this one had everything I was looking for.

I'm amazed at the photo quality-- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints.I only have one complaint, and that is the 8MB card included.  8MB for a camera like this is a joke.

Recently bought this Coolpix 4300 along with a 256MB ULTRA flash card ... As expected, I happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3M-4M Pixel/FINE combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to SLR models, and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately. I particularly like the \"TXT\" file which records all the Control information for all the pictures you take...The compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them.Try to buy a high capacity Ultra card, as it's 2X as faster as the regular CF card. Consider the time you save during picture taking (especially not missing a good moment) and during download, it's well worth the little extra money.An extra rechargeable EN-EL1 battery.. is also handy, so you will seldom run into \"out of battery\" situation. Use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run.One thing puzzles me is that for \"FINE and 2200+\" quality pictures, one Ultra 256MB CF card can only hold 130-140 pics, but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2MB, the math does not add up. I would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 MB/per.

Nikon 4300, I feel, is THE BEST camera out there for the features and price. Here were my requirements in a Digital Camera:1. I had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 Megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6\" or 5x7\" prints and I wanted some really great 8x10\" photos once in a while.2. I did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and I wasn't comfortable with that...I wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily.3. I wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills (although, I am an amateur with an interest in photography) by turning on the manual settings.4. And, of course, I wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because I had bought an expensive Camcorder before but hadn't used it much.Depending on all the above requirements, I had narrowed down my search to Nikon 4300 and Canon Powershot S400 models. Nikon got the final nod for its settings (auto and manual along with movie modes), medium & compact size, price, brand name, good software that is included and previous reviews.  I should say I have been very happy with my decision ever since. The pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details. A few things that might make it even better:1. Pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance.2. It takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and I have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow...3. The pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture.All the above, I think, are problems with all the Digital Cameras out there and so I have no major complaints. Try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems. Whichever camera you buy, add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card (I bought a 256 MB card), USB card reader, camera bag and the warranty. And finally, get your pictures developed at a Kodak Picture Maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat Kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness...Hope this review has helped you in making up your mind. I have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience.

After using it for about a month, I can state unequivocably that this Nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck.  Its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of Nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake.

The regular mode in this camera works for 80% of settings.  The \"scene\" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a \"regular\" setting.

But there are certain issues ( might be they are to me ) here - All of them are minor & not major ones though,. this camera keeps on autofocussing ( in auto mode ) with a buzzing sound which can't be stopped. Would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing. . if you want to have the date & time on the image, its only through their software \"Nikon view\" ( which reads the images date & time from the images meta-data ). So if you use your card reader & copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date & time. In that too, there isn't a direct way to add date & time - you got to say 'Print images' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date & time.. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image. images taken indoor weren't so clear. you got to have flash 'on' to get it ( eventhough your room is well lit ) . Lens cap is a really annoying. Go & get a high speed ( like Lexar 12x or higher ) CF card. Else with simpler ( viking ) CF cards, it takes couple of seconds to write a picture ( with approximately \"Fine**\" picture quality & \"Image size** : 1600 ).. The movie clips taken will always have some 'noise' in it - you can't avoid that. But overall this is a good camera with a 'really good' picture clarity & an exceptional close-up shooting capability.

We got a 256MB card, and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend.The only drawbacks that I have noticed:It comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long, especially if you use the flash a lot.  So, it's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging...It does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations (it allows the camera to focus in low light). I would say that this is not a major issue, but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things.It has a 3X optical zoom, which is average for these cameras.  For more, you sacrifice weight and size: more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length.  It does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom, but you sacrifice quality.I set the camera to the \"manual\" mode for one main reason: In any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries.  In manual, you can set it to \"single AF\" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic; this is not really a hinderance, you just have to be familiar with its menus and features. In reality, these are the only drawbacks this camera has, much less than many other models!It is easy to \"focus\" in on the drawbacks, so don't think I hate this camera.  It really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping.  For work, we use them in the field often, and they hold up really well.

I particularly like the Best Shot Selector feature, which has rescued a great shot for me on many occasions.  I do a lot of enlargements, cropping, etc., and the resolution is amazing even at 11x17.  I've experienced the same problems with the 4300 (as well as the 885) that others have noted - lag time, lens cap, power consumption, redeye, etc. - but most are petty inconveniences rather than major problems.  My advice to prospective buyers for this or any other upper midrange digital camera is: prepare to *study the manual* because it will only improve your comfort-level with the camera, not to mention the quality of your photos.  The \"point-and-shoot\" label is misleading - it's very user-friendly, but it's also a complex piece of electronics that performs even better if you know how you use it properly.

Got it for $359 at buydig.com in the summer of 2003.While the comments of some folks on speed of saves is valid (wasn't an issue for me), this is easily overcome by using faster memory cards.  I have found focusing to be precise and sharp, colours very vibrant (true to Nikon tradition).  As some people mention, yes using the flash indoors at distances greater than 8 feet does cause some agony, but I am currently looking for a slave flash unit to overcome that.Also, since I figured out how to set exposures manually, I have been drawn towards using the machine more frequently.  Of course, do not assume that higher aperture numbers automatically produce greater depth-of-field.  This digital camera applies a filter (as opposed to an actual aperture) to achieve the value of the aperture setting, and hence the lack of change in depth-of-field.  Deletes have been reasonably fast at under 20 seconds for a high quality JPEG image at the highest resolution available (which is 2272 or so).  That is fine by me as well, since I do my deletes later (and not while actually taking pictures).  I have two 256 MB and one 512MB CF cards and the smaller of those cards stores about 120 images at the resolution I talked of.The autoexposure modes are good for what they are designed to do, but all the scenes they have predefined don't always work for me.  Hence the need to turn to the manual mode.  Having said that, the wife gets very good pictures in the kids' school auditorium, in the school playground and in the classrooms using the predefined scenes.  So I really see no reason to complain.As for the editing software, it is reasonable, but I couldn't care less.  I don't edit my pictures.

In all fairness to some negative feedback that I've read, the camera works as well (I would say much better) than its 4 MegaPixel counterparts.  Deleting a file takes a few seconds, not minutes.  Delays in taking pictures has to do with utilizing the autofocus function, which you have the power to override with a manual option.  My biggest complaint is that when you use the video function it does not record sound.  So video is just video, unfortunately.  I find this an irritant, but one I can live with.

This is the camera that finally convinced me to give digital a try after 25+ years with my trusty Pentax SLR, without making a huge investment.  The 4300 was easy to use right out of the box, and after a few sessions with the owner's manual, easier still.  It's so user friendly that even my nine-year-old son is now a confirmed shutterbug, taking macro photos of the bugs and amphibians he finds out in the woods!We've had the camera for about six months now, and have used it for landscapes, portraits and sports shots - all of which have excellent detail, except for those in the maximum digital zoom mode, where there's quite a bit of loss in clarity.  All the scene modes work well, although I believe the landscape mode blurs the details just a bit.  Indoors, night time, and fireworks modes do a great job of making the correct settings for us.  Included Nikonview software is very basic and nothing to write home about.  The camera itself is small, very portable and easy to pack along for hiking trips.Gotta-have accessories:  We use a USB card reader to download images directly from the card, and speed is not an issue at all.  I don't think it's unreasonable to wait 1-2 seconds per photo.  You will definitely need to supplement the included 16mb memory card which only holds about 8 pix.

A slightly older design, but now down in price to compete with the newer kids on the block, so look out for the deals.

Switch to the scene mode (fireworks, sunset etc) and you don't have to worry about f-stops and apertures, your pictures will also benefit.  There is also enough scope for the developing photographer to explore in the manual mode.  Manual white balance, shutter speed and focussing are all here although there are only 2 true apertures from which to choose.

This camera will also let you take pictures in the TIFF file format, now these files are big because they are uncompressed, so yes, if you are shooting in TIFF you will wait a while for the images to be written to disk. The preset scene modes are great, because you can simply choose one such as \"landscape\" without knowing any of the technical details for that setting.

Just wanted to share that I've had this camera for 5 years now and it is still working great. It's got some scratches from being dropped a few times. We've used the camera for indoor and outdoors. Night use. Day use. Parties, schools, picnics, hikes, travelling abroad, halloween, christmas, family, business. This camera has been almost everywhere with us (except for underwater, ha!) Practical features too:  Zoom in, sports shots, quick video clips, special effects shots, reduce back lighting and glare, timer, auto, manual, portrait, sunsets, and so many more.Incidentally, over 20 years ago, I had my first Nikon camera, an FE. I didnt think that the lens of the simple coolpix could compare with the professional quality lenses I could place on my FE, but the ease of digital photography with the coolpix has more than compensated for its \"amateur\" level service.  I have even been able to take some professional looking chiaroscuro images that hearkened back to my photography buff days. I was surprised and happy with the results.We've even sent this camera in once for repair under warranty in its first year. It came back working better than ever(if not as it should have all along). Even my kids have gotten their turns with the coolpix. Yes, the battery has a short life, we have found that depending on use, we can get one day to 3 days of use on the battery life. We just charge it often and in between uses. So it still comes through for us despite the battery charging.We have had an easy experience with the coolpix 4300. its filled up our photo albums and library both digital and printed. We have all enjoyed this camera for family and fun use.We have just gotten a smaller, newer, more sophisticated and expensive Sony digital camera---I'm still on a wait and see mode on it. But, from durability alone, 5 years of use, I recommend the coolpix.

I recommend using the highest photo quality (Fine) to approach film-like quality of moderate enlargements. Do buy a 256MB or larger CF card as the included card fills up rapidly. At the highest quality level (Fine), a 256MB card will hold about 300 photographs at 1600x1200. The actual picture, which is represented on the LCD, is larger than what is shown through the viewfinder at all optical zoom levels.It is fairly easy to change between photographic modes in SCENE and take several shots of the same scene in fairly quick succession to compare how they treat the same light conditions. The digital zoom works well on horizontally/vertically linear objects such as text or buildings, but not so well on non-linear objects such as mountains.The low battery warning icon comes on when the battery is about 1/3 depleted, but carrying a spare battery which is fully charged will get you nearly 3 hours of continuous photographing. My replacement/spare battery depletes at a slightly slower rate than the battery included with the camera.My one problem/complaint is with the hyperactive auto-focus. In all of the modes I use, except Landscape, I have to semi-depress the shutter button for it to stop focusing back and forth through the object I am trying to photograph. The camera tends to focus through close objects, even in Close-up mode, and bring the background into focus instead of the flower/butterfly/bird/etc. that is the center and dominating portion of the image I am composing.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "My old favorite but...", "Author": "Luke Rad \"lz3broc\"", "ReviewID": "R3MRH6R0W04398", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with money my wife gave me for my birthday in 2001. At the time I wanted a great digital camera that had the look and feel of a more expensive model but with really good imaging capabilities. I looked at every review for months. I poured over product manuals and would goto the camera store 3 times a week to hold different cameras to see what I liked. Then I bought the 4300 when I found an awesome deal. Well I still like this camera very much. My wife uses it with as much ease as I do. But the last 2 years my biggest complaints are the batteries and the speed.Speed: Maybe its the camera, it takes so long to cycle between shots. Its definitely not the camera for taking multiple shots or getting the one instant really great shot.Batteries: I've always groaned about anything that uses proprietary technology. This camera can use Either $30 Nikon Li-ion rechargeable batteries or $10 1 time use CR5 Batteries. Finding a reliable source of CR5's is a pain in the butt. And paying $10 for a battery that lasts 2hrs is crap. The EN-EL1's aren't much better, Maybe the Two I have are crap now but I hate that I can charge both batteries for 4 hrs, and then Get less than 50 shots each from a allegedly freshly charged battery.I've always wished for a better Zoom as well. 3x Optical just doesn't cut it anymore. I never use Digital Zoom. I knew at one time there was a kit for adding a Telephoto lens that was supposed to add an additional 2x zoom, but I never could find the kit locally, and in the end a +2x zoom didn't seem worth it.Over the years other things have happened to it. Theres a slight blurriness on one side if the lens and the BAttery door no longer latches fully. I've went from 8MB CF card to a 16MB to a 256MB to a 2GB card. the 2GB card I got this last Christmas is supposed to be a much faster speed card, even though the camera is still just as slow as it was.Its still a really good camera. It has some of the best Images I've every taken. With amazing detail up close. With my tripod it will be used for studio type portraits or shots where I don't need speed.4MP has always been good for me. 90% of the time I never take photos that go over 4x6's.

It needs about 1-2 seconds from the moment I hit the shoot button until it actually takes the picture, and I have had so much occasion with peoples, where this ruined the take. Specially with kids, you have a good moment and shoot, but the picture is taken long after the good moment passed away. Also the time the camera needs to save the image after the take is extremely slow, there go other 10 good moments until the cam is ready again.

He and his girlfriend was on his way to Latin America for a once in a lifetime extended vacation and wanted a really good camera to catch them memories of that trip. I then had my son calling me on the phone to be advised that the Nikon Coolpix had packed up halfway through his trip, and worse still also finding out that the camera did not have any international warranty, despite that Nikon is a large and international company.I phoned Nikon to confirm the problems and decided to purchase him another Nikon Coolpix and send it to him and sort out the malfunctioning camera upon return. So upon his return to the Nikon camera was sent to Nikon Service Centre under warranty, only to be told that the camera had APPARENTLY suffered with humidity or water damage and was now uneconomic to repair. Quoting extracts from Nikon here they said: \"Advised customer that repair has liquid damage.\" The water has caused the components to corrode, evident by the white fungus/mould. Called customer and offered exchange of a 4300 at \u00a3328 inc VAT\"Being offered a replacement Nikon camera, but at a cost that turned out to be no kind favour at all, since it was far in excess of buying a new camera from a regular camera shop who sell the same item at a lot less, like \u00a379 difference, no warranty cover for water or humidity damage according to Nikon, so not really much help there then!Quote Brand NIKONProduct Name COOLPIX 4300Jessops Code  NIKC4300Jessops Price  \u00a3249.90  The battery life on the Nikon Coolpix camera's that I have experienced, in some cases only giving 20 to 30 pictures, does not seem good and does not get better, it gets worse if anything as the batteries seem to fade away! I have now returned 3 Nikon Coolpix camera's to my local dealer and now intend to return two more soon also for credit against other more reliable camera's from another camera company that has not forgotten how to look after its customers?I my family and friends, on my recommendations, have now all switched to Canon Camera's. We have already purchased so far Three PowerShot Camera's a G2 and G3 both 4 Million Pixel camera's at very good prices (since both are now obsolete models), also a lovely newer current model the Canon Powershot G5 which is now increased to a very useful 5 Million Pixels. The design facilities, the quality and ease of use of all of these Canon PowerShot camera's seems to be much excellent, especially the newer CanonPowershot G5. The battery life is on CanonPowershot G5 is on another planet, by excellent by comparison to Nikon Coolpix camera that I have experienced! CanonPowerShot camera's are now on a regular basis taking over 500 pictures, some with the flash and that includes looking at them lots also on the screen often in disbelief at the high quality! The quality of photographs under all conditions has proven to be excellent. The movie sequences are also an amazing feature. The CanonPowershot cameras are slightly larger, than the but that makes it easier not to drop from my experience, which is what I would do with Nikon Coolpix camera's after my bad experiences!My next purchases of expensive professional digital camera kits will likely also be Canon EOS range camera's also, perhaps not surprisingly!", "Date": "February 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Y.

Back then 4.0 MP was considered a high-end camera.  This camera has bee a workhorse for me.  Its nice and compact so you can stuff it in a jacket pocket or purse without weighing you down.Don't be put off by the lack of MPs - the camera takes great quality photos, even with the zoom function extended.  I've printed out 8 x 10 photos and gotten great results.This is a great camera to learn photography on.  Not only is it fully automatic, but you can set it to full manual override.  Changing the settings is easy through the monitor window and button controls.Transferring the photos is easy.  You can either mark the photos for transfer then transfer using the USB cable (provided) or directly by popping the memory card into your computer or printer.  My camera came with Nikon picture editing software but you can use whatever software you choose.The only downside is you will need to purchase extra batteries as the battery life is not the greatest.  Batteries are faily cheap if you choose aftermarket brands so I'd recommend keeping 3 or 4 extra on hand if you go out for the day.  Turning off the monitor and using the viewfinder helps reduce power consumption.  I like using the monitor as my viewfinder so I trade off with carrying extra batteries.The camera has nice extra features like exposure settings - portrait, night, fireworks, several indoor settings, sports, close-up (macro),multi-shots, etc.  They are easy to change through the menu button, so you can play with different effects.There is also a built in flash with red-eye reduction.  The flash works suprising well for a small flash.Sadly, my camera is showing its age now, but after 10 years and thousands of pictures and travel miles on it I can't complain.

I keep finding new aspects about this camera that put it over the top. But instead of naming all the good qualities, let me just hit on a few. The clarity of the photos I've taken is just simply astounding! Features, features, features! I still haven't gotten it all figured out. The only knock on this camera that I can think of would have to be when I take a picture in the Hi res setting. It seems to take forever. But that could also be the memory card as well. This is probably the best point and shoot short of a professional camera.", "Date": "November 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this camera to photograph very young children.", "Author": "KP \"KP\"", "ReviewID": "RZP64LL3DSEMU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My sister told me, right before my daughter was born, \"you will want to take that camera and smash it into a wall!\"  She was right!  Several times I have wanted to do just that.  The lag time between each shot is just too long to capture those instant events.  I have to take 20 to 40 shots to get my daughter smiling (I am not kidding). Little children and babies won't hold a smile or a pose for long.  I have missed so many shots...it is depressing. Also there is a pre flash or a flash indicator which alerts my daughter to close her eyes...I am not a professional...so I really don't know what this accomplishes.The quality of the shots you do get is very good as far as detail and crispness go but they definately lack something in the color arena.  If you use auto setting the flash captures the action very well but the color suffers.  My photos look too grey and harsh.  If you use the \"scene\" setting the flash and the colors are very true and natural but the picture comes out fuzzy no matter what you do...either you move a little or the subject does (one mode is \"party\" and I would like to see the blurry fuzzy pictures of people dancing).  If you don't use the flash in auto...you will also get slightly fuzzy pictures.  I have spent hours color correcting my pictures and it is a lot of work.  I would put up with it though if it would snap the darn pictures more quickly.Also the photo cap is just completely \"gimicky\" and unnecessary.  My daughter continuously wants to grab at it when I am trying to take a picture.  It dangles within her reach.  It also has ruined several shots I took of her laying down and I was standing over her and I did not see it hanging in the view...but in the image pic you see baby and right over her head a dark blob.Battery life is very good.  I can snap oodles of pics before charging.  You can take clear detailed pictures up close if you use auto setting with the flash on.", "Date": "January 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Efrain Morales", "ReviewID": "R1CHGV11KGFH4X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really I just want to write a short review.

I really like the camera alot. I have a Nikon 2500 which I love love love! But wanted something new. Any how...I was reading some of the online reviews before I made my purchase. Most of the people that gave the camera a bad review had complaints about removing the lens cap before turning the camera on and how it took a long time to delete a picture. Well it seems obivous that you would have to remove the lens cap before turning on the camera or the lens can't zoom out. The pictures taking awhile to delete would be because you need to make your image files smaller. The bigger the image is the longer it is going to take to delete. Over all this is a great camera. You just have to be smarter than the camera. Oh and know how to read owners manual.

My room is so dark and when I tried taking pics of it with my old camera, they came out black, but with this, they look the same in the picture as in real life. Better actually cause my carpet looks clean, lol. But this camera is great! The Picture quality is amazing and you cna connect it to your TV and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to. I can't connect it to my computer though, but that's a problem with Windows ME, not the camera. If you have Windows ME you should upgrade to XP anyway, lol. But it works perfectly fine on my parent's computer. It does have a lense cap, but it won't let you take pics with it on which is real good. The battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice.

I bought this camera back in July 2003 for $350 from Beach Camera. Alot of major annoyances with this camera such as the lens cap- you have to remember to take it off before you turn the camera on or else you get a message saying to take the cap off and restart the camera. The menu is tedious and cumbersome to work with. The manual settings take too much time. The start up time lags. Time between shots lag especially using flash. It can take up to 16 seconds between shots using flash. (You will definately lose alot of good potential shots using this camera). Its only a 4 megapixel camera. That might have been good in 2003 but in 2009- its time to buy a new camera. Does not have image stabilization.(IS is a must in 2009).The camera is pretty noisy while focusing. Battery usage is very low as is expected with all PS cameras. The included software is pretty much useless in 2009. Picture quality is pretty good which is one of this cameras highlights. So in conclusion- if you are on a shoe string budget then this is the camera you are going to get. I would not pay more than $70 used as this camera is over 6 years old in 2009. Dont expect any keeper shots if you need fast recycling time between shots. This camera was state of the art 6 years ago.

I currently own an Olympus D-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures.  However, indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy.  Anyway, in the store, I tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4MP models (Minolta Dimage S414, and Panasonic Lumix).  Focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time, pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange. Pictures produced by the Minolta were orange but not blurry.  Pictures produced by the Panasonic were excellent.  The store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when I press the button, which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models.  Anyway, I ended up purchasing the Lumix.  I'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about.
