{"Reviews": [{"Title": "What a great camera, with only minor flaws", "Author": "\"adpinc\"", "ReviewID": "R18A8VQO3M97HM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw this camera in a showcase at the Wiz, and was impressed with how small it was compared to the competition.  Given that I have an infant crawling around my house now, I found that I wanted to take instant pictures more and more, rather than taking 35mm and then sending them off for development.  I have a Canon Rebel-G, which I love, but is a bulky SLR and I found that I didn't just carry it around.  A digital camera was exactly what I had been looking for.Now I take this little camera everywhere I go.  For an ameteur, this camera is all you will ever need.  I use the medium quality (1600 x 1200 compressed) and the pictures are outstanding, especially for email and digital processing.  I haven't even tried taking pictures in high resolution (1600 x 1200 uncompressed), the quality is so good.  Friends and family are blown away at the clarity.The limitation on the quality would be the printer, which now I think maybe its time to buy a photo printer with higher resolution.Disadvantages:1) The flash card that comes with the camera is too small.  A second 8MB or one 16MB would be better.  That gives you an equivalent roll of film (20 shots or so on medium resolution).  I need to buy one.2) The battery supplied with the camera does not last long enough, especially with the LCD display enabled.  A second battery is a must, especially if you want to take the camera with you, and you don't want to lug the charger.  Fortunately, the battery is recharged within an hour.3) The camera gets surprisingly warm during extended use (a small nuisance).4) Switching to digital zoom mode feels like it takes too long, and the camera does not stay in digital zoom mode when switching between reviewing pictures and taking pictures.5) Red-eye reduction really doesn't help at all.6) I wish a power adaptor to run the camera was standard.  It needs to be bought seperately.7) A camera case should come with the camera and doesn't.  I highly recommend one be bought with the camera as the elegant stainless steel finish is likely to become scratched when carried about without a case. (I'm a bit fanatical about my electronics when I like them).8) When flipping through pictures previously taken, the camera closes its lens.  Not only is this a waste of battery life, it is annoying to wait for the lens to reopen for new shots.Advantages:1) Small size is fantastic!  You can take it everywhere.2) Powerful flash.  Brightens images even 10 feet away.3) Super-clear image quality.  It feels like you can reach into the picture when you see it on the screen.4) Awesome software.  The camera comes with a USB cable, and when it is plugged in, the computer wakes up and downloads the images.  The software is very easy to use, and highly intuitive.  It makes digital editing a pleasure.  A great feature.5) Viewfinder or LCD display are both available for use, and the LCD can be disabled to save battery life.  Very nice.6) Optical and digital zooms work very well (though a bit slow).  Image centering seems perfect in viewfinder.7) Image processing is quick.  You can snap a picture every two seconds without waiting for the image to process.8) The lens is protected when not in use, and is self-stored.Overall, I am thrilled with this camera, given the misgivings of many others.  Canon is a trusted name in photography, and I highly recommend this unit.", "Date": "October 1, 2000"}, {"Title": "Fantastic little camera - but needs a couple of accessories", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1GCQ3PZCCVYS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the camera that I've been waiting 18 months for - decent price, small but well built, high resolution and great quality. After a week of ownership, overall I'm delighted with the product. However, it was poor of Canon not to include a pouch for the camera - no more than a $1 cost to them but essential in protecting the camera from an occasional knock, IMO. Also missing is an AC adapter to power the camera - the included battery charger requires that the battery be removed from the camera, meaning that I can't be charging the battery while transferring images to the pc Note: If you are planning on buying this camera (or any other digital camera), be aware that you will need to buy a high-capacity compact flash card. If you go on a vacation and plan on taking more than 15 pics or so before you get back to your computer, then the stock 8mb card included with the camera won't cut it. I got a 64mb card (About $120) which should do nicely. Also note: The battery only lasts about a day of moderate camera usage - you might want to consider buying a second battery if you plan on taking a lot of snaps.", "Date": "November 28, 2000"}, {"Title": "A Terrific, Compact easy to use Digital camera", "Author": "Colin Ooi", "ReviewID": "RBB40ICZRAHHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera recently to replace my Sony Mavica digital camera and to use alongside my Canon EOS 300 SLR camera.My initial concerns that the camera would not be compatible with my Pentium III 800 running Windows Millenium Edition were unfounded. I had downloaded the appropriate driver from the canon.com.au website and installed this, rather than the driver was on the Canon CD that came along with the camera. There had been mention only of compatibility with W98 and W2K, so I was relieved to find the WME driver available.Setup was quick and without a hassle. I was able to operate camera, and transfer pictures without having to open the manual at all.This camera is very much an improvement over my previous digital camera. With super fast transfer of pictures by USB, its ultra compact shape and size, retractable lens system, and its 3-point autofocus system, the Canon Ixus has produced numerous images that I will keep.I have found the ZoomBrowser software to be very easy to use, although other reviewers have mentioned their dislike of this particular application. The PC will automatically detect the camera when you switch it on and plug the USB cable in, and will launch the ZoomBrowser for you. You can even transfer pictures from the PC to the camera which comes in handy when you want to bring your CF card to a photo developer to produce prints for selected photos.I bought an extra rechargeable battery to go with it and it turned out to be a good decision. I added a 64 MB Compact flash to the 8 MB one that came with it, as well. The 64 MB card will store 107 1600 X 1200 pictures or over 360 640x480 pictures.Overall this camera gets 5 stars from me. It is a true pocket-sized camera with its light weight portability being a major plus!", "Date": "November 25, 2000"}, {"Title": "Take it everywhere, it's so small, you will use it more!", "Author": "R. Ross \"RLRJupiter\"", "ReviewID": "R2UUAVZNB1ZTQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As many of you, I have been holding out until the prices were more reasonable.  The size of this camera alone, and the reviews above told me it was time to buy.  You will be impressed with how Canon has squeezed so  much into such a small space.  The camera comes with a quick charger and  one battery pack.  Time to charge about 2 hours.  Setup was so simple that  as a first time digital camera owner, I had little trouble after a quick  scan of the manual setting up for my first shots.  The LCD display is  bright and though small, very easy to see. Controls are well laid out and  simple to understand.  I am so impressed with this camera, because it is so  simple to use and due to it's size, I know I will take it along more often  than my old 35mm monster.  Suggestion, order a larger flash card (the  included 8mb card is almost useless for high resolution photos).  The only  negative, no medium resolution such as 1024x768.  You are stuck with  1600x1200 or 640x480, but this won't be a problem if you have a larger  flash card.  If you're a graphics artist, you will probably want a  3megapixel camera, but for the average user, this small camera will get  used more due to it's size and takes great photos.  Very happy with my  decision to buy this camera.", "Date": "July 14, 2000"}, {"Title": "Three Quibbles", "Author": "Sam Trychin", "ReviewID": "RKYBSHY7GQV01", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I agree that this is an amazing camera for its size, but I wanted to add some caveats:1) The quality of the photos is slightly lower than that of top-of-the-line 2.1 megapixel cameras (e.g., the PowerShot S10).  This is due to the extreme miniturization of the lens and CCD.  Keep in mind that this camera trades some image quality for convenience.2) Only three image resolution/quality combinations: 1600x1200 hi-quality JPEG, 1600x1200 compressed JPEG, and 640x480 compressed JPEG.  I would have liked a mid-range size between 1600x1200 and 640x480 (1280x960?), and the ability to choose image quality settings (hi/low is enough for me) on a per-resolution basis, for a total of six combinations.3) Colors are not quite as bright/saturated as on the Nikon CoolPix 950/990, Olympus 2020z/3030z, or even the Canon PowerShot S10 & S20.These three quibbles are relatively minor, but seemed worth mentioning.Convenience is more important to me than absolute image quality, so I am extremely happy with this camera.  Image quality is still remarkably good, and it is by far the most convenient (and cutest!) digital camera currently available.

Mallory \"Woodworking Rev\"", "ReviewID": "RQ9JXY3EQSO6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this little baby two weeks after it hit the market here and I have had a little time to put it through its paces.  In fact, it has even been to Israel with a friend and he has the same reaction that I have.  As a travel companion, it is great.  The color saturation is pretty good, though not quite as good as Olympus.  However, remember that you can correct that in software if you know how to use it.  The images are sharp and well balanced.  The optics are exception for a camera inn this class!  Learn to use the white balance settings and your photos will improve.Use the high-res mode (1600x1200), the images are not that large and the image is much better.  At the same time, buy yourself at least a 64meg card, I use a 128meg card and that is good for around 80 shots.  If you need to squeeze more on, the hi-res compressed mode is not bad at all; just remember that the images are not going to be as detailed when enlarged.The battery lasts a lot longer than average.  I suspect that that is partially due to the lighting of the LCD screen coming from a white LED rather than a more conventional source.  It is not uncommon for a battery to last the whole day of shooting.  For me that is about 60-70 Hi-Res pictures.  While there is no disposable option, the spare battery can be had for a reasonanble price (litium-ion batteries are very expensive, trust me when I say Canon's price here is reasonable!)The down sides?  No type II slot for Microdrive or high capacity cards. Thus, you are probably limited to 192meg cards.  The macro is limited.  I'd like to focus down a little more.  The zoom is fine for me, but for nature shooters, it could be limiting.  The preview is awkward and the camera defaults out of the box to low res (640x400) be sure to reset the defaults to the high setting (1600x1200).These are all nits!  Given the size, quality of construction and the images that you can produce with this camera, the down sides are minor and can be ignored by the average snap shot photographer.", "Date": "October 5, 2000"}, {"Title": "An ideal APS camera replacement", "Author": "K Gill", "ReviewID": "R246BPI527BOFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few days and have put it through it's paces. I bought the Digital Elph to replace an APS camera, and it takes shots that are comparable, if not better than the APS.  Even the 8x10's prints (in fine mode 1600 x 1200) look about the same as with my old APS (in superfine mode, they look even better!).  With a 4 x 6 print size, (in fine mode 1600 x 1200) you will see little difference in quality when compared to an average 35mm camera.The advantages of this camera far outweigh the disadvantages.  Quite simply, it is easy to use, and the battery life is better than most and it recharges fast.  It has a solid feel, a stainless steel case and is really well built.  The LCD is easily viewable in daylight. Fine mode at 1600 x 1200, is perfect for most pictures.  The software that comes with it is first rate, and easy to use. Taking panorama shots, and \"stitching\" them together with the provided software is really simple to do.  Red-eye correction works well (For a camera that has a flash this small and close to the lens) as long as the subjects look right into the camera.  The \"Wow! What is that?\" factor is difficult to describe.  This camera is an attention-getter!Disadvantages?  I can't complain about the small size of things, the buttons are about as good as they can be on something this small.  As with all digital cameras you will have to buy extra memory card(s), I bought a 64MB card that hold plenty of pics.  You will also have to buy an extra battery, which because it is proprietary, cost .... (but is also lithium-Ion, an advantage.)  When going from optical zoom to digital zoom, the transition in the LCD screen is jerky, but who cares about digital zoom anyway (If you need to zoom in more, take your shots in Super Fine mode, and enlarge the picture in software).  This baby can get HOT! when you use it.Other information of interest:  USB connectivity worked fine in Win2k, but it did require a reboot before it would function.  Pics in all but the brightest light outdoors seem to be slightly under exposed, I set the exposure +1/3 f-stop, and it seems to capture colors more accurately.  A video out cable lets you view your photos on your TV.The Powershot ...

I was smitten and bought one immediately. I have taken about 200 pictures in the last 2 weeks and  have not been disappointed.If you want a camera to take everywhere to  record life's events, this is the camera. You can't truly appreciate the  size of this camera until you see it in person. I took it bike riding last  week and hooked it to my belt (using the OEM case). I had to check several  times to make sure it was still there.While serious hobbyists may  complain that image quality is not up to the top digital cameras, 99% of us  will be more than satisfied. Prints up to 8 by 10 are comparable in quality  to film based cameras. Plus I like the fact that with the included software  and my trusty Epson printer, I can correct some of my little boo boos like  red eye problems.One final thing make sure that you leave some money in  your budget for a larger CF card, an extra battery and the OEM case since  you will be taking this camera everywhere and taking more pictures than you  ever thought possible.Great job Canon.", "Date": "July 9, 2000"}, {"Title": "Easy to use.  Good quality and fun!", "Author": "Dave Keiser", "ReviewID": "RAV9SBFC51P4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.  I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.  In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.  The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).But the BEST thing about this little camera is that it is being used.  It only takes a few seconds to turn on, we take our shot with out having to mess with dials and settings every time and then go on.  Then, when the card is full we download it to our computer for viewing, printing and later storage on a CD.It's so easy, we use it all the time and since there's no film, we don't worry about taking too much.  We'll edit bad shots out when we want.  I'm just glad that we're saving memories really easily, because that's what cameras are for!If you're looking for a nice point and shoot digital camera that does all the 'brain-work' for you and will take great shots, and be fun to use all at the same time, this is a very good choice!", "Date": "October 26, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "David Ferguson", "ReviewID": "R28HMW0ZWSVYFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would like to address a few things that have been mentioned.  In one review, someone disliked this camera because of compatibility.  First, I would like to say that I work at a software corporation, and am very familiar with how USB works.  USB does NOT work on NT4.0.  Period.  It does work on Windows 2000, 98, and 95 with certain patches.  If you want to use this camera with NT4.0, you will need a card reader, or a serial cable.  I do believe a serial cable is available for this camera as well.  Also, you can get a floppy disk adapter for the memory card.Secondly, I just purchased this camera, and I am extremely glad that I did.  I was deciding between this camera and the Olympus camera.  The small size is what pushed me toward this one.  After I got it, I realized how easy to use the camera was, and just how convenient the small size is.  The Olympus, also, was made of plastic, making it much more fragile than this camera.  The stainless steel case makes this camera very sturdy.Next, the picture quality is great.  I've used some digital cameras before (this is the first time I've owned one) and this one by far has had the best picture quality that I have seen.  All of the accessories that I need can easily fit in a very small bag if I need to travel, and if I don't, it fits in my jacket pocket.Lastly, the options that this camera gives you is comparable to every other camera in its price range.  The only option that it did not provide that the Olympus camera did was that of Quick Time movies.  Although this would be neat to have, I think that I would never use it because of the amount of memory that it would require.  Because of this, I think this camera is well worth the money, and a very good buy.", "Date": "November 9, 2000"}, {"Title": "Who says size doesn't matter!", "Author": "John A. Radi \"jradi\"", "ReviewID": "R1LQC2M5LJ9IXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).  A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to \"digital zoom\")Size naturally means  pricey - [and] may seem a little bit much for a point and shoot camera  but but it has one feature which sets apart from all others: it's small  enough that you'll have it with you!  Being a gadget guru - I've owned  about a dozen cameras and this is the first one that I always carry around.The next two features which are equally important in any digital camera  you're considering:2.  Compact Flash Support - Smart Media memory is too  expensive, in short supply, and doesn't seem to be growing in capacity as  quickly as Compact Flash.  So CF seems to be the way of the future in  \"digital film.\"3.  USB support.  Sure, there are floppy  adapters and serial cables which are cheaper - but they're SLOW!  Imagine  copying a 2MB picture through your floppy drive - it would take several  MINUTES vice a few seconds via USB!  If it's cumbersome, you're not going  to use it.  Not only does this have built in USB support (great for sharing  files w/ other PC's), but Compact Flash USB readers are getting cheaper and  that'll save you battery life when downloading to your own pc.The rest  of these features are all on the same level.... 4.  Rechargeable battery.  While it's more convenient to have a camera that uses generic batteries (AA  or AAA) that usually means bulky and not as efficient.  This camera has a  proprietary rechargeable Li-ion battery that comes with a little device so  you can plug it right in the wall and recharge it.  Very compact, recharges  in about 2 hrs, if you're just taking shots using the viewfinder and  letting the camera show you the shot for <2 seconds (best method) then  you can average over 250 shots per recharge!  If you're using the camera's  LCD to take shots then you'll drain the battery in about 85 shots (not  recommended)5. Built-in lens cover.6.  All metal housing - very  durable.  Except for the Compact Flash door - which is plastic (why! ) it's  a very durable casing - unfortunately I'm a little worried about that CF  door!Comments:**No LCD to view memory status, etc...  However, the  LCD window is used to display information.  Can hardly blame Canon, this  thing is so small there's no place to put an LCD panel!**Very few manual  controls, and image quality settings.  There are 3 settings and on the 8MB  included card you can store 4 / 12 / 46 photos depending on which  resolution you choose.  I'd recommend buying a 64MB card asap, and just  take all photos at the highest resolution - you can always decide later to  scale down photos on your pc...**Playback mode.  I had my first camera  for nearly a year before I realized what a benefit it was.  On the fly  share your photo album in anyone's house in their living room, vice  computer desk - makes it easy for sharing with a lot of people.  The Canon  has a unique feature which allows you to flip Vertical pictures (when you  take shots with the camera held vertically).**Very Quick Camera.  The  Elph has an large image buffer so you can take rapid series of photos  quickly.  Depending on image setting, anywhere from 3/9/45 shots before it  dumps to CF Memory (which takes 3 seconds).  Other cameras don't have this  feature and you might have to wait 3 seconds per shot!**Image Quality.  On a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a 9.  Highest resolution prints decent  8x10's which is about all I'd ask from a digital camera.  It's fixed at ISO  100, so it's not exactly a lowlight camera, but it does fine with flash.That's about it - I hope you enjoy yours!", "Date": "August 19, 2000"}, {"Title": "This little camera is nearly perfect", "Author": "P.

I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera. I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module. Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).  The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom. This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example. While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.The included software works with a unique feature of the camera: \"photostitch\" lets you pan left or right to build a panoramic shot, or even wrap it completely into a 360 degree image. The LCD monitor works to let you see 1/3 of the last picture overlaid on the current one, for near-perfect alignment. When you click on the \"stitched\" images, the software combines them in only two or three steps.You can also put the camera into a \"continuous\" (two shots a second) mode for catching a series of events, and you can \"mark\" images for printing when the CF card is placed in a compatible photo printer. There is also a macro mode available.The unit is tiny (about 2\" x 3\" x 1\") and feels as solid as a tank.

In the 70's and 80's I used several 35mm SLR's, then got lazy and have had several 35mm point and shoot auto everything cameras.  On two occasions I tried out APS format cameras, the latest being the Canon Elph 370Z.  The APS format cannot hold a candle to 35mm for overall picture quality, but the size and feel of the Elph made up for some of the lost points.  It's failure was in the flash department...totally inadequate and inconstant.  But the size, look and feel of the Elph was wonderful, thus I tried out the Digital Elph S100.  This camera is great.  Point and shoot and 90% of the time you get an excellent photo.  The inferior flash is not as much a problem with digital cameras....I guess they work much like camcorders in that department.  I think anything less than a 2 megapixel digital will not give the results that a 35mm gives and anything over that is overkill for the typical person taking 4x6 snapshots.  This camera is replacing a $200 Olympus point and shoot 35mm that has been an excellent camera, but didn't take a drop off a 10 foot balcony very well.  When you shoot at the default resolution and reduce to 4x6 inch, you will see a sharper 4x6 than any point and shoot 35mm I have used.  To get 10 photo album \"keepers\", I would shoot maybe 20 to 30 shots, discarding 2/3 of them.  With this format, you only get printed the ones you want.  This camera, like any small camera produces bad \"red eye\" with the flash, but with the Adobe Photo Shop that comes with it, you remove the \"red eye\" with just a few clicks of the mouse.  Upload your digital files to Amazon's Ofoto and in less than a week you have beautiful prints.  And since you print only the \"keepers\" it will cost you less in the long run.Now back to this camera, Canon doesn't ship it with the neat little leather case that slides on your belt that comes with the other Elphs.  The one for the Elph-2 fits it perfect and Amazon has it.  The 8MB flash card will give you only about 10 shots, so go ahead and order a 32 or 48MB one.

I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.  I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.  This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.  I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!  First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.  The included battery charger is larger!  Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.  I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)  The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.  The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off. I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.  I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.  But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.  And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.  One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!  Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.  This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!  I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.  As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.  I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.  At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.

I wanted a digital camera to take the place of my point and shoot, and not necessarily my SLR. The Digital ELPH fits that role admirably. It's size is the major plus for me. I take it everywhere with me now and since it's digital, I don't have to worry about wasting film. I just carry it in my front pocket whenever I'm walking around.The resolution is good enough for a nice 5x7, and 8x10 is certainly possible for anybody not too critical of quality. I have noticed a bit of fringing in the pics on occasion, but nothing significant. The USB port allows fast downloads, and the included software is adequate, though I do most of my work in Photoshop. I have noticed a bit more red eye than I'm used to, but I just have to remember to us the red eye reduction feature on the camera. The included 8 mb flash card quickly became insufficient and I got a Lexar Media 48 mb flash card, which gives me about 77 pictures at medium quality (around 500Kb) and about 31 pictures at high quality (around 1.7 mb). Another issue is the battery life. Luckily, the camera comes with a rechargeable battery, unlike the S10 and S20. I'll probably have to get another one of these if I'm out shooting for an extended time.Overall a great camera for just shooting around.

The panoramic mode is incredibly cool - the camera fixes the exposure settings and lets you view the previous shot before you take the next one over.

Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:Aren't you sometimes annoyed at the size and weight of your big SLR and its collection of delicate lenses?  Are you sometimes intimidated by your own gear, and its seemingly built-in expectation that every photo should be worthy of National Geographic or Life Magazine?  Do you sometimes leave it home or leave it in the bag, rather than intimidate friends and family with your big paparazzi-like weapon?  At a party, a wedding, or just outside playing with the kids, don't you sometimes envy people snapping away with pocket cameras - and wish that taking pictures could be that weightless for you?In other words, admit it - there are times when all your wonderful camera gear just gets in the way.  For years my big Nikon has kept me from taking (and sharing) the kind of family snapshots and casual, experimental pictures that made photography so incredibly popular.  Making copies of pictures was a pain, and mailing them to friends took several weeks from beginning to end.My S100 changed that for me, and I'm having a ball.  Technical nit-picking aside, the images are surprisingly sharp, the colors are accurate and the software is impressively easy to use.  It's shirt-pocket small, yet the stainless steel body makes it feel rock solid.  I've packed it many times to baseball games and a construction site without any fear of bumping something and wrecking the camera.  It sits in the palm of my hand, inconspicuously hidden in my lap or a pocket while I wait for a nice candid moment - something my Nikon couldn't possibly manage.  It even fits easily in my front jeans pocket.  When travelling, the S100 doesn't make me an instant target for purse-snatching thieves or pickpockets the way my camera bag used to.  On airplanes, my one carry-on bag can finally contain something other than camera equipment.As with any digital, I love being able to instantly review my picture, delete it if necessary and re-take it on the spot.  I've saved a few key images that way, and the built-in meter is smart enough that I don't find too many poor exposures.  I boubght a 128 Mb memory card (much more money but well worth it) and can store two hundred plus pictures before downloading.The Canon software that stores and organizes your images is surprisingly good - and makes emailing them very easy and intuitive.  Far from being an afterthought I find it to be an asset and a true feature of the camera.One more thing, one that really surprised and pleased me.  Put a digital camera in the hands of a responsible child and you'll be amazed at the instant flow of creativity that it unleashes.

I travel to Mexico a lot and the S100 is just so easy to keep in my little waist pack that reaching for it is second nature. No opportunity gets by me to record where I am or what I see. With the addition of a Viking 64MB flash card, I can capture over 80 shots without even thinking twice about capacity. Indoors, the built in flash is adequate under 10 feet but can overexpose a little close up. Outdoors, images are extremely crisp and detailed without having to go into the superfine 1600 X 1200 mode although overcast provides a little too much blue tinge. While that can be corrected using the accompanying Adobe software, Adobe annoyingly keeps the retouched image in a proprietary format and really increases the file size.I travel with my little Sony Vaio subnotebook (a great combination at less than 3 lbs.) and the USB transfer using the installed Zoombrowser software is effortless and very quick. My evening ritual when I get back to my hotel room is to download the photos into their own daily folder (about a 3 minute task after a full day of shooting), choose the \"keepers\", eliminate the duplicates or those poorly framed, rename them for their location and subject matter and then review them using the Zoombrowser's slide show.When I'm home, I connect my notebook to my television monitor through its S-video input and friends and family enjoy the whole digital experience, kind of like the old days of slides but without the drudgery of trays and the racket of the projector fan.

I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on. Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips). 2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots. This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system. 3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card (I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res). 4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.

I love to take pictures of my 4 boys, and in the first few days of practice I've taken so  of the best pictures I have ever taken before.  Fantastic close ups.  It's so easy when you don't have to catch a good one by chance. Take several shots and you know if you have a good one.  The pictures are sharp and clear. (Almost too sharp and clear f you don't have a flawless face.  Thank goodness it is easy to touch up.  I highly recommend Photo Suite III.  You do take the risk of a fuzzy shot if you think you have enough light and you don't use the flash. The camera itself chooses a slow shutter speed with no flash (p.37).  I was also dismayed about not having the ability to use the low resolution with the auto setting, but actually you don't lose any quality of performance in the manual setting.  You just have the ability to change and set some settings.  If you want to keep the settings when you turn the camera off, you just set the mode in the \"saving the shooting\" to last (p.62).  The only problem I have with this camera is that the on/off button is so close to the shutter button.

So I made a black stretchy slipover pouch that just hugs the camera itself,  I attached a small elastic cord loop to the pouch corner, and that glides along a black cord that I threaded through the camera's wrist strap hole. The pouch stays on the cord when I slide it out to use the camera, and it gives it a little more protection from scratches.  It looks attractive and people don't know it is a camera.

Even with its relatively compact size and rugged construction, I found myself leaving the S10 behind more often than not. It was light, it was small, but it wasn't light enough, and it wasn't small enough.The S100 solves that. For the most part, it is an S10 in a smaller, lighter package. Slipped inside your coat pocket, or hanging off your belt in a case, it's barely noticeable.  But take it out to shoot, and the quality and flexibility will astound.As with the S10, the S100 is easy to learn.  Unlike the S10, there is no secondary display on top to provide information on shooting mode, pictures remaining, etc.  The color LCD on the camera's rear shows overlay menus and stats to provide this. In other digital cameras, this might be a serious negative: using up valuable battery power. But given how miserly the S100 is with electricity, the arrangement doesn't seriously impact the number of pictures you can take.And you can take a lot of pictures.  By adding a larger compact flash card, such as the Viking 128MB, you can capture a short vacation's worth of pictures without downloading.  A choice of three different resolution/compression settings helps conserve memory.  The rechargeable battery (included) will nearly see you through the entire 128MB, depending on how much you use the LCD display for shooting and editing.  With a second battery, you're virtually assured that you won't run out of power during a day out. The recharger is multi-voltage, so with a plug convertor, you can recharge your battery in many foreign countries.The electric frugality also means that you're free to edit your shots on the go, snapping a half dozen or more in any circumstance, and deleting all but the best.  This is great for shooting pictures of the camera shy.  They're assured that you're only keeping the \"good\" shots.  It also works well with children, as you can provide them the instant gratification of seeing the picture only seconds after it's been shot.  (This isn't particular to the S100, obviously, but its battery life helps!)A few negatives of the S100: (1) the flash slot is CF1, rather than CF2 (as in the S10 and S20), which means no microdrives. (2) The flash is weak, as might be expected in a camera of this size, and located so close to the lens as to just about guarantee red eye. I've gotten some spectacular examples of the latter. With post-processing you can mitigate the red-eye, but it often takes an artist to really eradicate it. (3) The controls are small, and may be difficult for some fingers. (4) The shutter lag is substantial, making it very difficult to capture action (although the continuous shooting mode helps).  (5) The 2x zoom often leaves me wanting. The 2-megapixel resolution helps, as you can often blow up the middle of a shot and still have sufficient pixels for a smaller print.The programmed exposure modes are adequate, and the manual settings can help, but at its heart, the S100 is a happy snapper. Great for snapshots, but frustrating for sophisticated photographers who find themselves in unusual lighting.  The panaromic mode, combined with the photo stitching software works well.One can discuss the merits and demerits of the 2- and 3-megapixel cameras on the market, but if portability is your primary concern, the S10 is hard to beat.

I've read other reviews where people have complained about the flash (or lack thereof) on this camera, and how it affects the picture quality, and I'd agree.With that said, I've gotten more use out of this camera in the last few days than I have with just about any camera before.

This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.First off, the ease of interface with the PC was very good.  I set up the camera, followed the brief instructions in the manual and had no problems setting up the camera to interface with my PC (I've got Windows 2000).Second, the quality of the pictures is fantastic!  I have used the amazon.com site to get the pictures developed like a \"real\" camera, and have been very pleased with what I have gotten back.  I have also used the pictures on a Ceiva Digtial Picture frame, and that has worked very well too.Third, the camera's features are top-notch.  The black and white ability, as well as the piece-meal panorama pictures (you put them together with the included software) are great.

The standard 8mb compact flash card is only adequate (12 pictures at the Large/Fine setting and only 4 at the Large/Super fine setting).  I recommend at least a 32mb card which will increase the storage capacity to a 35mm SLR's with a large roll of film.

The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it. The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it. But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.The larger the CompactFlash card that you use, the slower  it takes for the ELPH to turn on. It takes about 2-3 seconds of pressing  the on button plus 2 more seconds till you can shoot a picture. I  understand this is to prevent automatic turn-ons but sometimes I want to  immediately take a picture.That aside, this is a great camera. I bought  a 32mb CompactFlash to go with it and shoot in Fine mode (1600x1200  compressed) and get about 50-60 images.

But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.The S100 is very small, and easily  fits in a pocket.  It is much easier to use than the A5 Zoom was (there are  only 2 main camera modes: take pictures or review stored pictures), and I  haven't had to consult the manual since the day I bought the camera.  Picture quality is excellent, in my opinion. The S100 comes with a USB  cable to download pictures to your PC, which provides a massive speed  improvement over the serial connection of the A5 Zoom.  The software  supplied with the camera is also a major improvement, IMO, over the  software supplied with the A5 Zoom.  I found it much easier to browse &  access my pictures with the new software.  The S100 has an optical/digital  zoom which isn't terribly powerful, but is a nice feature, and as with the  A5 Zoom, the LCD display is excellent.  Unlike the A5 Zoom, the S100 comes  with a battery charger in the box (Yes!).About the only negative thing  I can say about this camera is that the 8MB CompactFlash card supplied with  the camera only holds 12 pictures at the \"Large\" (1600x1200)  setting.

The Elph doesn't give you all the operations of a conventional SLR, but it does give you the basic settings to compose excellent quality everyday pictures.I'll start with the \"Pro's\":  The small size makes this camera one to hang out with ALL the time.  Excellent quality high resolution output.  I *love* taking great panoramic \"photostitch\" pictures.  The macro setting is also fun to play with.  You can get as close as 4 inches from your subject.  Pretty neat from a fixed lens. It is super easy to set up camera and install the software.  Don't lug around those big photo albums!  With the supplied video cable (VC-200) you can put on a great picture show for your friends in your house or theirs all from the palm of your hand. The Canon ZoomBrowser software is very intuitive and easy to use. Adobe PhotoShop software stirs your creative juices and I promise will turn you into a digital Picasso.The \"Con's\":  Battery life is zapped too quickly (about 1/2 hr) (A battery charger is included in the kit and it takes about 2 1/2 hours to recharge the batteries - which which you can expect according to the manual to last for only 300 charges).  You'll definately want a spare battery!  No camera case is included.  The included 8 mg CF disk can only hold a few pictures.  I just purchased the Viking CF128M 128 MB CompactFlash Card from Amazon at an excellent price.  Red eye only works marginally, you'll need to run many of those pics through Adobe Photoshop.  The Elph is not geared for those outdoor night pictures, even if there are lots of city lights.  Evening city light pictures I took ended up dim but that could be because I'm still learning how to optimize all the settings.So, besides the cost of this camera, I have had to fork out another $250.00.

I recommend taking several shots to make sure you get a good one.The hook-up to the computer was very easy, but you must have a USB port. I found all the software decent, but unless you have someone helping you, the photo editing tools take a while to learn. The software is good though, contrary to what you may have read in other reviews. I suspect that people who knock the software just got frustrated on learning it.Overall, a great camera.

With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.  I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.The camera:  Amazing size; it is literally about the size of a deck and a half of cards.  It fits into my pants pocket or my chest pocket without a problem.  Great pictures, especially in daylight.  I went for a walk with my dog today and took a picture in the midday sunlight and I got back and it was fabulous.  But pictures with the flash aren't that great, unfortunately.  The foreground usually gets too bright and the backround not light enough.  The 2X optical zoom is great but the 2X digital zoom doesn't do much I've found.  The resolution is good enough so that you can take a picture using optical zoom and then crop the part you want and it will still be a good sized picture.  The software that comes with camera is adequate.  It lets you view the pictures you take and then edit them a little bit, extract redeye was the feature I used most.  But there are many other great features that I haven't really explored, but I have played around with a little.The battery:  It probaly lasts about a half hour using the LCD screen.  But if you just point and snap using the traditional viewfinder the camera lasts very much longer.  It takes about an hour to charge with the included charger that plugs right into any outlet.  I would recommend buying an extra battery.Also I would recommend buying a carrying case, the Canon Powershot case is an excellent fit and also has a small pounch on the front for an extra CF card and/or battery.  I bought a 128MB card which is great when you go away for a while and won't have access to your computer.

Seccia \"ronseccia\"", "ReviewID": "R1R4MD2DQEAIIF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100... after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.I wanted a digital camera to replace my 35mm point and shoot - primarily for snapshots of my kids at various events.  I wanted something I could easily take with me without having to \"lug\" around a big piece of equipment.  I wanted quality images to email to family members AND to occasionally produce quality prints.  I also wanted the ability to transfer the images easily to my PC.  The s100 delivers on all points.ProsCompact Size.  Did you ever go somewhere with your camera and feel like carrying it with you was an annoyance and a hindrance to enjoying yourself?  Before I bought the s100, I would usually bring my 35 mm point and shoot instead of my SLR simply because of the size.  Now I take my s100 everywhere which means more and better pictures.  You can slip it into your pocket and take it anywhere without that \"burdened feeling\" of carrying around a big camera.  The s100 is very small (about the size of a deck of cards)  yet comfortable to use.  Some other digital cameras like the Sony Mavica are much bigger and to me, carrying them around is a hassle.Image Quality.  This camera takes excellent quality images.  Outdoor photos are superb.  Images shot indoors using the flash are very good although sometimes a bit under exposed which is the case with most digital cameras in this class.  The macro (close up) function works incredibly well.  I ordered prints from images produced on the high resolution/fine setting which came out great.  Realistically,  there is no digital camera substitute (yet) for a good 35mm SLR in terms of image quality on prints.  But if you're considering replacing your 35mm point and shoot with a digital, the s100 is an excellent choice.Video Out.  The S100 comes with a video cable that allows you to connect the camera to a TV to display the images.  At first, I couldn't care less about this feature as I figured I'd never use it.  Wrong.  I use this more than I thought - like when I took photos at a birthday party and everyone wanted to see the pictures.  Instead of  people crowding around the little camera, I connected it to the TV, set it to auto-display, and we watched a slide show of all the pictures!  This is handy if you have family members without a PC since you can record the photos to VHS tape.Con'sLimited Resolution Settings.  This camera has only two resolution settings: 640x480 (fine compression) and 1600x1200 (fine and superfine compression).  So, you need to decide before shooting what you plan to do with the images.  The lower resolution is for online viewing and email while the higher resolution is better for making prints.  A medium setting such as 1024 x 768 would be nice since it's acceptable for both online viewing and producing small (4x6) prints.No Battery Life Indicator.  This camera has no indication of how much battery life you have left.  You get an indicator when the battery is low but by then it's too late.  It would be nice to have an estimate of the time remaining.Small Optical Zoom.  This camera has only a 2X optical zoom which is on par with most of the cameras in this class.  This is sufficient when shooting subjects that are fairly close but a higher powered optical zoom would be nice.  Digital zoom degrades the image so I suggest turning it off.Low Light / Fast Action.  You really need an adequate light source when shooting indoors to get an optimum picture.  Generally, the flash works well if you're within several feet of your subject but further away you need to have sufficient ambient light.  This camera is also not a great choice for fast action shots like sporting events.  You can use the continuos shoot mode but it is pretty much hit and miss.  The low light / fast action issues are typical for most digital cameras in this class.  If you plan to shoot a lot under these conditions, you'll need a higher end camera or a good 35mm film camera.AccessoriesBattery.  I didn't buy a second battery and  so far haven't needed one.  It will all depend on your picture taking habits.  If you plan to use the camera over a long period such as a vacation, I recommend a second battery.Compact Flash (CF) Card.  You DEFINITELY need a larger CF card than the 8MB included with the camera.  I bought a 32MB card which is sufficient for my needs.  I typically shoot at the high resolution using fine compression which gives me about 60 shots on the 32MB card.  Using superfine I'd get less than half that.  If you plan to take many pictures at the highest resolution/superfine compression, you'll need even more memory.CF Card Reader.... I don't use any of the software that came with the camera.AC Adapter.  If you get a CF Card reader you will not need an AC Adapter unless you plan to use the camera for extended periods.Summary.

Many tips has already been said in these reviews so I'm going to add to it. One review said that the person had tremendous trouble installing the software on a Win98 platform. My first installation was succesfull. I used Win98 second edition to help with the installation. Something you should keep in mind. The SP100 only supports USB transferring of data to your PC. So you need a USB port attatched to your motherboard. The latest boards has a USB port. But the older ones ( which is not that long ago ! ) does not have a port and you have to buy a USB card to plug into your motherboard. I had to do that.The rest of the installation and connection to the camera is mind blowing easy and quickly ! Downloading photo's to your pc is like saying 1,2,3.Then something another reviewer said. Sometimes the photo's tend to be a bit dark. Quite true. But you CAN force the flash to stay on. You also can set the flash on Slow-Syncro mode which adjusts itself to the slow shutter speeds. You can also set the exposure compensation and the white balance.There are a few more things the cam can do. I will name some of them. Shooting continuously, ( 2 images per second until you release the button), a timer ( takes a photo after 10 seconds ), shooting close-ups, stitch photo's together, replay images on your TV (realy cool), and taking black and white photo's.The software is okay...nothing to rave about !

I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking). This is the only camera with all these capabilities. Even with the waterproof housing it is small. The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap. The metal housing seems very rugged. Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds. I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes. For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that. The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds. You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background. The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260. The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus. The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery. The panorama modes are wonderful. Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field. High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly. It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere. In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera. The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure). 1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.

The camera was excellent.  We took nearly 300 pictures, and most looked quite good in spite of our lack of photographic experience (or instincts).  It traveled quite easily and even survived an unexpected camel gallop while swinging wildly around my neck.Hints:\u00b7 We got the camera at a discount by waiting until a local photo shop featured \"Canon Day\" with special deals on Canon products.  For us this happened around the holidays.\u00b7 Extra flash cards are a must, but the amount will depend on the longest interval you expect before downloading.  We did not bring a computer, so we needed lots of megabytes worth of storage.  Flash cards go on sale in different sizes at different times from different stores, so pay attention.  I scored some cards cheap when a local Office Depot store closed down and sold off their inventory at low prices.  Tip - calculate the cost per megabyte to better compare various vendors' functional prices.  The sweet spot these days seems to be 32 meg cards.\u00b7 Although the camera travels well in your pocket, a small inexpensive belt-mounted camera case helps keep an extra battery and flash cards in one place.\u00b7 You'll definitely want a second battery if you do more than, say, 35-40 photos before re-charging.  We only used the second battery twice because we only turned on the display when needed.\u00b7 Don't bother buying a neck strap.  When you go to a professional conference and ask for a neck strap instead of a pin or clip for your name tag.

This thing is tiny, and silver, and made of metal. It looks hot, it feels sturdy. Many people have come up to me to ask about it.2) Portability. I take it everywhere, literally. It's in my purse and goes everywhere with me so I never miss the perfect picture of a gorgeous sunset or my husband doing something funny. The size is also good because it's unobtrusive -- SLRs can get in the way at parties and inhibit \"natural\" pictures because people are too aware of the camera. The S100 is less invasive -- it's quick, it's small and it's fun, and that's the way picutures of friends and family come out because of it.3) Quality. The pictures are very good quality. I almost never take my Canon 35 mm SLR out any more because the S100 takes great photos and is so incredibly portable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this can replace an SLR if you're a serious arty photo buff. But the ease of use and portability of it makes up for the minimal drop in quality. Compared to my friends' digital cameras, the S100 takes superior pictures, even at the middle quality setting. As for prints, I bought a Canon BJ color printer for a couple hundred bucks and the prints are superb!4) Memory. Compact flash, while still pricey, is the least expensive common form of removeable media. Don't count Iomega's click disks which are cheap but aren't widely used. Stock up on CF -- if you're anything like me you'll need a lot of CF cards because you won't want to stop taking pictures. I have used cards from the major manufacturers in the following sizes with no problems: 96, 64, 15, 8. Removeable memory is WAY better than embedded because when you use up the space, you can just pop in a new card and keep shooting.The negatives:1) Weak flash. If you're inside, you had better be no farther away from your subject than 10 feet in a lit room and 5 feet in a dim room.2) Micro focus. The focus is a little flakey on very small objects. I like close up shots, and if I'm trying to shoot a small insect or flower (maybe half as small as a dime) the focus has trouble finding it. There is no manual override. This is semi-reasonable, but still disappointing. Other than this extreme close up limitation, the focus is great.3) Short battery life. This problem is not unique to the S100. It's no problem really, just make sure to get 1-2 spares. Mine lasts me about 2 hours of solid use. If you're planning to take it on a trip, just make sure you bring the charger (included) and spare batteries.Bottom line, the pros far outweigh the cons. I couldn't be happier with the camera.

First of all, contrary to some of the reviews on this site, USB absolutely does not work with NT.  And the opitonal Cannon Serial Port cable is not compatible with the S100.  So you have 2 options, 1) a PC (pcmcia) CF adapter card or 2) a Parallel port CF card reader.  Sand Disk makes both and I've used both successfully.Options #1 is cheaper (about $15) but it will only work if you have card wizard installed as NT does not dynamically recognize PC cards.  Card Wizard comes loaded on some newer model laptops like IBM thinkpad, so if you have card wizard this is the cheaper, faster and easiest way to go.  If you have an older model laptop without card wizard then your machine might hang if you boot it with the card seated.  If you insert it after boot it will not be recognized.  You can purchase card wizard separately but it's about $80 so if you don't already have it I'd recommend options #2Option #2 is a CF card reader that plugs into your parallel port.  It costs about $50 and has a Y connection so you can maintian your printer connection and the disk reader at the same time.  It seeam to be a bit slower than the PC card and is more combersome to pack/unpack...I hope this helps some poor sole as I burned many hours figuring this out.p.s.

Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.Three things make this camera a particularly good buy:First, and most importantly, its size makes it SO CONVENIENT. I have had absolutely no qualms dropping the S100 in a bag or pocket and walking out to a birthday party, a sports event, or whatever--space simply isn't an issue with this camera. As a result, I have taken some of the best shots of friends and family with the Canon.Second, the feature set is basic, but very easy to use. The power button is a simple button--no toggle thumb switches with multiple settings that can sometimes be confusing. Switching between viewing and capturing modes is simple and straightforward, and even the more advanced features (such as changing the flash mode) are easy to figure out even without reading the manual.Finally, the \"built in\" lense cap is a big plus. I didn't realize how nice this \"feature\" is until I briefly used a friend's digital camera and had to remove and replace the lense cap WITH EVERY SHOT. The built in cap seems insignificant with light use, but when taking many shots over the course of a few hours, the S100 really shines.Photographers should be warned, however, that the S100 is not a professional-level camera by any means. The 2.1 megapixel resolution, while not meager, is not enough to yield even high-quality 5x7's. Serious cropping of a photo is usually out of the question because of the limited resolution.So, if you will be using your camera as a \"fun\" camera--for casual pictures--look no further.

Other 2-megapixel cameras offer a more powerful zoom lens and more image-control settings.The flash worked fine for shots taken at the maximum-rated distance under indoor lighting conditions, but it overexposed images taken inside at the minimum-rated macro distance. We were impressed with the sharpness of macro images captured outdoors with no flash. Standard shots taken without flash under outdoor lighting conditions showed slight underexposure but accurate color. The S100's panorama mode worked effectively, as did its burst mode, in which we captured one shot per second at the high-resolution and high-compression settings and three shots every 4 seconds at the high-resolution and low-compression settings.The S100 feels balanced in its shiny stainless steel case and flattens to a smooth, flat box when the lens retracts; an integrated cover protects the lens when retracted. External control buttons are minimal, because you adjust most of the setting through menus, but, unfortunately, the relatively small LCD and small menu font present an operational challenge.The S100's bright LCD displays a graphical menu system which attempts simplicity, but misses the mark and leads you back to the User Guide to clarify navigation and features at every turn. It can be frustrating to use the small LCD to take advantage of the camera's effective panorama mode, but better that than using the viewfinder in this mode. The S100 can be ready to capture your first shot in 3 seconds and subsequent shots every 7 seconds.Compared to others in its class, the S100 is well equipped and designed, with both a USB interface and convenient access to batteries and media when the camera is mounted on a tripod. The included software bundles together a valuable mix of applications, particularly the effective image-stitching software for panorama-mode shots.", "Date": "March 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera For Your Average Photographer", "Author": "Paul \"pmsmith66\"", "ReviewID": "R2W6S29NWC6W51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.  The Canon S100 destroys this problem.  I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.  The results are superb...both in print and over the computer.The computer interface (I use Windows ME) was a no-brainer.  Absolutely no problems whatsoever with installation or use.Uploading photos to your preferred online printing shop (OFoto, etc.) is simple and straightforward.  The quality of the printed shots is outstanding.  So far my prints have all been 4x6 and the clarity is outstanding.  I'm NOT a professional but I am pretty picky and to my eyes the quality of the S100 prints live up to the very best shots I've ever taken with traditional 35mm cameras.  In fact, the number of \"bad\" shots is substantially less than with the traditional 35mm camera.  Consistency is just outstanding.I've purchased the Viking 64MB memory card (great price here at Amazon) and find that it works very well and that it is plenty fast.Low light shots could be better but I haven't found this to be a limiting issue.Bottom line...buy this camera and prepare to take more quality shots than you've ever taken before.

Before I bought it, I got it as a graduation gift. It is soo cool! Here are some things you should know about the s100:1. The battery usage is pretty good, I've heard a lot of complaints about other cameras. For some reason I always have the LCD on, so I dont know how long they last without that. Buying a second battery is very helpful, and I really recommend it.2. It comes with 3 cool softwares. One is great for organizing your pictures in a \"library\", it does it quick and easily accessible. You can put the pics into folders and name them. From the camera, each picture already has a date on it. Adobe PhotoDeluxe is good at editing, but if you want pro quality, I recommend Adobe Photoshop. It also installs a software for making panoramic photos. The camera makes taking those pictures easy, and the software makes stitching them together even easier. You can stitch together 2 pictures or more (I usuallly do 5 or 6).3. Some people seem to have a few problems with the flash, but I like it. It is really tiny, and hardly noticable, but very strong. It also sends a smaller light out first to decrease red eye. I still get red eye sometimes, but i fix it easily with a kids photo software program.4. I have pretty big fingers, but I havent had much of a problem with the controls. You can do all kinds of things right on the camera, like manual exposure or flash, regular zoom, continuous shooting, deleting and rotating pictures, or making them black and white. All can be done quite easily.5. When I am taking pictures of people at home, I love to plug the camera into the TV so everyone can see the LCD screen. This was a big hit at my graduation party.6. A lot of people will come up and ask you about the camera. Most people are surprised its digital and the features it has. Also, people are really surprised by the photos you print, if you have a good printer.I also got a memory card reader with mine, which downloads pictures really fast and doesnt waste battery power.

I was able to operate camera, and transfer pictures without having to refer to  the manual at all.This camera is very much an improvement over my previous digital camera. With super fast transfer of pictures by USB, its ultra compact shape and size, retractable lens system, and its 3-point autofocus system, the Canon Ixus has produced numerous images that I will keep.I have found the ZoomBrowser software to be very easy to use, although other reviewers have mentioned their dislike of this particular application. The PC will automatically detect the camera when you switch it on and plug the USB cable in, and will launch the ZoomBrowser for you. You can even transfer pictures from the PC to the camera which comes in handy when you want to bring your CF card to a photo developer to produce prints for selected photos.I bought an extra rechargeable battery to go with it and it turned out to be a good decision. I added a 64 MB Compact flash to the 8 MB one that came with it, as well. The 64 MB card will store 107 1600 X 1200 pictures or over 360 640x480 pictures.

A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:1. The 3-point AiAF works great in most situations. But for tricky situations, you'll be greatly disappointed as you can't control the focusing point.2. Don't have high hopes for macro mode. Forget about closeup shots of flowers and insects. It just can't focus close enough. Also, you'll have to use the LCD for macro cos the optical viewfinder does not have closeup correction.3. Fleeting moments will remain fleeting moments. The lag between the pressing of the shutter button and the actual picture is very noticable. Common for digital cameras, but if you're used to film cameras, this is something you'd have to get used to (really tough taking sports photography).4. Don't try taking pictures of people at wide-angle, unless you know what you're doing. Zoom it all the way in, or you'll get distorted faces and enemies if you send it to the subjects.5. Just a minor point here. The lettering on the camera body comes off real easy, especially if you subject it to rough usage like I do. Like the ON/OFF button on mine is completely gone, so friends can't figure out how to turn it on (which suits me fine). But the body is really rugged. Subjected mine to a good number of minor knocks, but it's not worrying.6. Last point. Minor for some, major for others. This thing is highly attractive.

It's, literally, no bigger than a pack of cigarettes. It'll fit right in your front pocket. But, don't let its size fool you. It appears to be built very rugged -- not nearly all plastic as many cameras in this price range are. I bought the camera just before Christmas and the very first picture I took was shot across a 28-foot living room at night using the built-in flash. The wall on the far end was perfectly exposed. I kept wondering how a flash so small could put out such power. I really haven't had one bad exposure. I just made a trip to Las Vegas and took dozens of snapshots along the strip at night without the flash. Every one turned out great. I shoot mostly on medium resolution and a 64mb flash card is about all you need -- unless you'll be gone for weeks. The only annoyance: somehow, the optical viewfinder was not installed perfectly level (with the digital viewfinder), but the Canon service folks took care of that. This really is a GREAT camera -- same superb quality as my old 1981 Canon AE-1 Program which is still my favorite 35mm.... The Elph is a winner.

Which, ofcourse, means the better quality pictures you want to take, the morestorage space you need. I recommend a 32M, or better, Compact Flashcard...  2)Buy an extra battery.  The batter will last around 70 or sopictures using a flash, with the LCD turned off, but if you plan ongoing on vacation, you will definitly need one.  3)Image quality isinconsistent.  This could be my fault, but under the camera automaticsetting, some pictures come out way too dark, red, or blurry.  This isspecially true when taking pictures indoors.  But daylight outdoorpictures are truely beautiful.  4) You need to hold the camera verysteady when taking pictures due to its small size.

Photography was too analog for me in this digital age. Make no mistake, I am in mechanical engineering, but to me, those 35mm camera was too tedious  in terms of usage. You could not see how you took the picture on the spot, or that you had to use all of the film to get the prints.My attitude towards taking photos changed when I saw my dad's Nikon Coolpix 800 half a year ago. All of my problems with conventional cameras were solved when I saw the pictures on the small but very sharp LCD. Since then, my quest to find a digital camera began. After all the considerations from sorting through countless reviews, I chose Canon Powershot S100 for the following reasons.1. It is very light and compact. Besides my cell phone, slim and  light Ericsson T28, and Palm V, this camera is so compact  that you worry about sitting on it without realizing that  you have it inside your pocket. 2. The quality is very satisfying for an amateur photographer  like me. Also, the functions included in this camera  is really worth the price. I use the Black and White  option with gusto. 3. You don't have to buy films... for ever! Of course,  you have to have other kinds of data medium like the  flash card, but having photos in forms of graphic files  makes things so easier in this world of computers and  the internet.  In addition, places like Kinko's are now having machines  that lets you make fine prints from your digital camera.However, there are some problems. 1. Because the camera's power consumption is very high, you are  forced to buy an AC adapter or extra batteries. 2. Also, the 8MB flash card included with the camera is toooo  puny. I had to buy a bigger one. 3. The software that is included is not that good. But hey,  the Japanese are excellent in hardware, not that good  in terms of software(not just yet).  4. Also, it took me some frustrating moments to install the  USB driver... And I thought I was frequent with computers for  the past 16 years!  (P.S. To dear Craig; get someone who is good at computers  and have the person install the driver for you. It was hair  raising for me also) 5. You need sufficient light source in order to take a good  picture.... But again, this applies to MANY digital cameras  out there. My advice; believe in the power of the sun.Uhmmm... and besides these five little complaints, this camera rocks. My, I can write far more complements on this camera on and on. Also, the price; it is one of the most affordable and attention-grabbing cameras out there(actually, S100 captures not only photos but attention of other people as well).Until I get serious about photography, this camera will be 'camera' that I will cherish for a veryyyy long time to come, and I hope that you will, too.", "Date": "February 10, 2001"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera but.. there is a new one on the way", "Author": "Lwalters77", "ReviewID": "R1PP6I1B4XNGVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is great.

It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.  I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!  The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).However, I do have a few things to complain about...First off, the battery.  This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.  Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.  The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.  Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!  Very wrong.  The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.  Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.The flash is very weak.  Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.  The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.  To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.  The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.These are all the flaws I found in the camera, it's not my first choice in cameras, I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.

On the highest quality setting in good lighting it makes very acceptable prints.  For pictures taken in lower lighting outside the reach of the flash, you can definitely see the prints starting to get grainier.  If you don't make prints at all but keep your pictures on a computer, you'll probably be perfectly happy with the resolution.I did get a 64MB card in addition to the 8MB card the camera came with; you might also want to consider a second battery since using the flash a lot (like at indoor family gatherings) can quickly exhaust the poor thing.

I got a SanDisk 128 MB CF Card.You *may* want to get an extra battery.  If you turn the LCD display OFF while taking pictures, you don't even need an extra battery.

While it has its limitations - lack of a good zoom, anemic flash and hard-to-see viewfinder, it takes great pictures and is exceptionally easy to tote around.  I have not used the highest resolution mode and have been quite satisfied with 8X10 prints printed on my HP 890 or sent to Ofoto.  The panorama mode can produce spectacular results and by the way is an easy way around the limitations of the camera's 2.1 megapixel resolution.  If you play around with the size of your panoramas, you  can print pictures larger than 8X10 that will be as sharp as your 8X10's.  If you don't have a large format printer, use a printing service for that special photo.  I have been blown away by the instant feedback I get from a digital camera and the Elph has made photography a lot more fun.  Often, it's the only camera I carry, but I still lug around an APS SLR with a big zoom when I'm doing serious photography.  I have been rather surprised how well some hand-held night shots come out.  I've gotten pictures at dusk that are reasonably sharp and show much more detail than I would expect from the camera's ISO 100 rating.  It is essential to have a second battery as your battery will always run out when you need it.  I use Lexar CF cards, they come with a USB cable and transfer pictures 3x faster than the camera.  Set the camera in \"manual\" mode, which is still basically automatic, as it allows you to choose all the flash modes available.  In addition, set the camera to remember the last settings or you will have to put it into manual mode each time you turn it on.  Unlike a lot of digital cameras on the market, the Elph is easy to use and carry and feels like a camera.  Its menus are a little complex but people who don't find features that are there and complain about difficulty of use just haven't studied the manual.  I have recommended the camera to my friends on this basis:  in 5 years it will be obsolete but it will still fit in your pocket and you will still be using it for snapshots.", "Date": "February 10, 2001"}, {"Title": "Gone but not forgotten", "Author": "William W.

It's buggy, has bad error messages, performs slowly, doesn't play well with Windows file directories.  Sometimes I spend 10-15 minutes trying to get my computer (a 6-month old Dell laptop, Windows XP, plenty of memory, processing speed, etc...we're not talking an old computer problem) to recognize the camera so that I can download my pictures from the camera to my laptop.This week, I'm in Anaheim, CA to take my family to Disneyland.  I need to take the last batch of pictures off the camera so we can take pictures at Disneyland.  I got an error message when launching the Zoombrowser program (the incredibly friendly \"The Error E_Fail occurred in the program\", with only the \"OK\" button to push.

I called in, went through 3-4 menu prompts , and got to a human in about 3 minutes, which was better than previous times.  I'm told by the technical support person that I \"need to uninstall and re-install the program, and re-load all my images.  Do you have your original Zoombrowser CD?\"  I explained that I was travelling, and that I didn't carry all the software I have with me, what were my other options?Here's the killer:  he said there weren't any!  I explained that I was connected to a high-speed Internet connection at the hotel, surely there must be a way that I could get the program.  The rep explained that they don't make the program available because they sell it to others, and others would download it.  This went on for 10 minutes.  I asked to speak to someone else who could give me some options, or explain why I couldn't download a copy of the program, and he refused to pass me along.  I asked for the address of the person who runs the photography business unit at Canon, and he said he had no idea, that person was in Japan.  No help whatsoever.This is about the fourth or fifth time the Zoombrowser software has died on me in 18 months.  It's a just a piece of junk.

Bush \"mc_bush\"", "ReviewID": "R15ABY7RXYBNPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get. Thank you Santa!It's been nearly a year of fun use of this little darlin', and there's no stopping me. The picture quality is excellent, and the camera itself is sure to become a classic - what with the real aluminum shell, and tiny size, this camera is packed with cachet. Nice thing is that it's also easy to use, and the results are remarkable.During our company softball tournament in which my boss and I were playing, I handed this to one of my friends to take pictures, and my boss handed another his \"best in class\" Olympus 4 mega-pixel. The results - the Olympus was a little sharper, and had a bigger telephoto, but the users all showed a preference to own the Canon.Here's the scoop - Pixels aren't everything. There are several other variables in getting a great picture. Of course there's the aesthetic of the photographer which can't be quantified, but on the technical side there are also others. Many tend to focus on numbers when buying equipment - what's the resolution - how many watts - what's the horsepower. But can you really rate things this way? Is a BMW Z3 the most powerful car or is it sufficiently powered? How well it corners may be a better metric. The S100 may not be the most powerful in terms of resolution or zooming capabilities, but it sure looks and handles great!On the technical side - the lens is excellent. I suspect that it's pushing the resolving power limit for such a small piece of glass. If you remember from your Physics classes the theoretical ultimate resolving power of a lens is directly proportional to it's diameter. With such a small diameter, one can only reach a certain limit. From examining the results up close one can see that the resolving power of the lens is the limiting factor in the overall resolution. Details break up in the image before the pixels become evident. All this to say that the only way to make the picture sharper would be to make the lens wider which would scale the whole camera bigger, and who would want that?The camera does an excellent job focusing, determining the correct exposure, and balancing colors - three other aspects to good image quality - other than simple \"pixel count\". I've made prints from shutterfly.com up to 5x7 so far, and nobody would be able to tell that these were not shot with 35mm - and a full size SLR at that.OK now for the drawbacks. Nothing is perfect. The main gripe I have is the amount of \"shutter lag\". That is, the amount of time it can take between pressing the shutter button and the camera firing. I suspect that most of this delay is required to get such fine results. Canon calls it AiAF. It basically takes a sample picture prior to the real one and sets the focus, exposure, flash, and white balance accordingly. Nice thing is that it's reading all this stuff from the same CCD sensor that will eventually give you the image - not some little sensor away from the lens that point and shoot film cameras require. But it does cause about a 0.5 second delay - just long enough to loose the moment. But with some practice it's not difficult to pre-focus by pressing halfway down - then press the rest of the way down when ready to fire.I could go on and on about this little jewel - cool stuff - with just a few minor issues - the shutter lag being by far the worst.Right now I see that Amazon has a great deal on it. Great deal! They must have bought up a bunch of these for this price. It has been discontinued and replaced with the S110. The only differences I can see is that the S110 has a minor video mode and 2MB of built in Flash memory so you can take a picture or two without a memory card in it - no big deal. I just keep the 8MB card that comes with it as a spare, after all you are going to go out and get at least a 64MB card to go with it any way aren't you? If you want to pay extra, get the S300 which has a 3X zoom instead of the 2X on this one.Enjoy and happy holidays!", "Date": "November 19, 2001"}, {"Title": "Need a tiny camera? Need  a Tough Camera?

Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.  BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.I found the Canon on closeout at Compusa for a crazy low price. Should have bought every one they had, but lacking the bucks, I picked up one, intending to play with it for a day or two and then sell it off at Ebay for a nice profit.I'm still using it 4 months later.  I can't bring myself to sell it.  I've never opened the included 8mb CF card as it's stupid for Canon to even include a card if they're going to put one in that small,  it won't hold the equivilent of a roll of film.  There are lots of sellers of CF cards now priced right. I put a 128mb chip in that cost me less than $50.I've read some complaints about the battery.  I don't think those folks know what they are talking about.  As long as you are not messing around too much reviewing photos,  the included battery will last you all day. If not,  get a converter and plug your battery in your car for a quick recharge. No big deal.The lens is a bit slow,  and it really doesn't have the reach I'd like,  but that's fixable.  (...) buy an adapter and one of his monocular lens add ons. Works very well, but it's a bit of a pain to focus. Once you figure out how it all works together you can get photos of birds in the tops of trees with no trouble. Better buy a little tri-pod though.The best photos are taken by the camera you have at the time you need to take the photo. This camera and the others in it's line are pocketable and built to be hauled around. This is the camera that will take the photo you would have missed!

I spent the first few days running around snapping pictures of friends to send to a pal in AK via e-mail.  The software included makes downloading to your computer a no brainer, and you can compress photos and send them to disk or via e-mail instantly.The memory card that comes with it is kinda cute, but I recommend ditching it for a larger one--8MB just isn't enough.  My guy gave me a 48MB compact flash card, and with the photo quality set at fine/large it still holds about 80 images.The camera's size makes it a blast to handle; it will fit in your pocket or one of the riddiculously small cases I found at Ritz Camera.  I think what I love most about it is that it takes the guesswork out of taking pictures.  I've always been a pocket camera type of girl, and would leave film sitting around on shelves and in my camera until I didn't know what was on the rolls anymore.

And, it has the 3X zoom.  The price is $... more.In my opinion the 3X zoom is nice but it is not worth $.. more and a large increase in size.  I also cannot see how such limited movie making capabilities would be useful.  I therefore bought the S....The camera takes very good pictures.  The flash has a tendency to cause a slight blue cast on some things indoors.  The low-light capabilities are not that great but then I think they are as good as my previous Minolta Vectis APS point-and-shoot (which by the way has a 76mm zoom compared to the S100s 70mm, not much different).  The ability to preview shots after taking them is great.  Outdoor shots are where this camera really shines.  They are great!  Overall, I think it takes pictures just as good if not better than my old Minolta APS.  It fits easily in my jeans pocket.  The battery life is not bad.  Get a second battery if you are going to use it on trips.I deducted a star for the following reasons:  they should have either not included a compactflash card and reduced the price or included a larger compactflash card than 8mb, they should have a leather case available in the US like they do in Canada and Europe, I would have preferred a pop-up flash like they do on some of their Elphs, I would have preferred more standard batteries but I understand why they went with the proprietary one, I would prefer the ability to change image capture resolution without having to switch into manual mode.Overall this is a great camera.  Well worth the price.  It is going to replace my Minolta Vectis APS 25.  I am very impressed with the pictures I have taken with it so far (except for maybe some of the indoor with flash shots).

I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.  The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.  The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder. If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.  They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.  When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.  Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.  It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.  Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.", "Date": "July 21, 2003"}, {"Title": "Software not compatible with XP", "Author": "Rufus' mom \"Collector\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZEMZTJ15AQKB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I originally gave this camera 5 stars.

It is only compatible with computers running Windows 98 or 2000, not NT and then only with computers with the latest USB standard.  Most computers built over 6 months ago do not comply with this standard.  Before purchasing, go to your PC manufacturers web-site or call them to check on compatibility.  As an laternative Canon recommends a [memory] card reader but these have the exact same issue.  I have NOT yet been able to load pictures onto my PC so have NOT been able to send or print anything whatsoever.

The camera shuts down completely whenever plugged into the USB cable.  The computer has no pre-loaded S100 drivers.  The software bundled with the camera does not seem to include a usb driver. It seems to be oriented towards rs232c ports, but the literature says that the S100 only connects to usb.  I downloaded a driver from the Canon web site but nothing has changed. The computer does not even know it has a new \"device\" connected.  I suspect that I might need the optional, Canon ac power kit, but the Canon tech folks advised me otherwise by E-mail.  I don't want to shell out the $$ for the ac kit if Canon says isn't necessary.  I am at the point where I would return the camera, but it was a gift and that is not an option.
