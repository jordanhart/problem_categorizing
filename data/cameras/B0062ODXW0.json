I found a Security camera review website that recommended Honeywell products.The downside was that instead of 4 cameras, for the same money, I get one camera.  BUT everything worked out of the box.  Easy to read instructions and was able to quickly verify all features worked.  This is more than I can say for other systems I purchased.Would recommend this system to others that want a quality Camera/DVR but don't want to spend the $ of an IP camera system.T", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$268.69", "Features": "1/3\" CCD Integrated True Day/Night Super High Resolution IR Dome Camera", "Name": "Honeywell Video HD73P Day/Night IR Vandal Resistant Dome Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HEqQV0diL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0062ODXW0"}}
