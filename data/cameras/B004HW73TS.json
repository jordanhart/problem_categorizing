I have four other digital cameras from Fujifilm, Nikon and Kodak but this bargain-basement priced camera is better than all of them, and they are not the entry level cameras in their lines like this one is. I've never used a Canon before but I can definitely see why people love them. To be fair though, the zoom range is not very good on this camera compared to many on the market today, but it's perfect if you're going to be doing a lot of close up macro shots or if you're looking for a good cheap camera to start out with that doesn't require advanced knowledge of photography principles. Its focus range is .4 inches to infinity so you can get right up on a subject and get a perfectly sharp and clear picture. It even has a focus assist that fires this little orange beam from right next to the lens that measures the distance to your target and adjusts focus appropriately. The smart auto feature is also extremely handy and very accurate at choosing your shutter, aperture, ISO, and white balance for you. This camera is hands-down the best point and shoot I have ever used, it takes great photos with little to no effort on your part and surpasses even high end consumer models in other manufacturer's product lines. Don't let the low price fool you, this camera will really surprise you with its picture quality.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "powershot a800", "Author": "bay", "ReviewID": "R1GC4ASBORZLFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a gift.My girl friend is using it and taking wonderful pictures.Very easy to use and very easy to learn on this camera.Great camera!!!

I got tired of being asked constantly to borrow my, more expensive, camera. I bought one of those toy cameras once; it was more than half the price of this one and it broke within a few months. This one is a lot more sturdy and has stood up to some pretty rough handling.Batteries aren't the propietary charge style, which is nice. They're simple AAA batteries; which means you can buy some at any store or get some regular rechargeables.The images are pretty good. And the screen is the perfect size, and decently lit, to assist in composing a decent photo with this camera.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera for daughter to take to camp", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R8HM8MMKOKQQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This has been a super camera for my 11 year old- it is a bit slow but a great one to learn on.

I purchased this camera with the intention to make sure I have a one available, and I am actually surprised on how much I like it. For one thing, it arrived 3 days after ordering it (THANK YOU, BTW) and it is very simple to use. Over all, I am pleased.

It recently pooped out and I wanted to spend as little as possible on a new one. From the reviews I read on several websites, this Canon A800 seemed to be a good choice. And it is for the most part. The pictures are fine although it sometimes takes a long time to focus and I have to push the button a few times to get it to take a picture. (When I'm trying to take pictures of my black dog, it has a heck of a time locking in on the face.) The other annoying thing is that the batteries don't last nearly as long as some reviewers have stated. The batteries it came with lasted about a month. The second set that I put in only lasted about a week. Now I'm going to have to buy some rechargeable ones. So it's going to end up costing over $100 with the batteries and the memory card that you need to take any pictures at all.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked for a few days, then Lens Error", "Author": "Howdoyouspellthis", "ReviewID": "R8PQYXPCNV4A7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Powershot A800 worked for a few days and then started displaying Lens Error every time I turn it on.
