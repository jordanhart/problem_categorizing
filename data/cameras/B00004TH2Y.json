{"Reviews": [{"Title": "No risk camera buy - great value for money", "Author": "\"comares\"", "ReviewID": "RNKB75B2LU46A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best buy I ever did!I bought the Gold millenium package of the Kodak DC215. It is exactly the same camera as the standard DC215, which comes in silver. It adds a 8MB flash card instead of 4MB and a fast USB  card reader. I regretted the purchase somewhat after I found out that my  two year old PC doesn't have a USB plug, so I have to use the serial cable,  which is also provided as a slower alternative. I also found the 8MB card  just too small for a weekend trip. Since digital pictures are essentially  'free', I tend to make more pictures than I used to. The 8MB card is good  for some 40 to 50 pictures. I am now thinking about a 64 MB card in order  to avoid laborious selecting and erasing of pictures on the road.  Altogether, after checking your PC, I recommend the silver DC215.I had  the camera working out of teh box in two minutes! Installing the PC  application was really easy and my first pictire was on the web in 15  minutes. The camera does consume power quickly. I found it unworkable with  4 standard AA batteries. I bought a charger and 8 Ni-Mh batteries from the  KODAK website. It is a great addition to the camera! The batteries are good  for two to three weeks vacation use. The charger is a really nice and  compact design; highly recommended!Now on the camera itself: It is an  amazing camera that makes crystal sharp picture beyond belief. Having had  12 normal camera's before, I know what it takes to make good pictures. This  camera has some outstanding features:  (a) an incredible wide angle which  allows for great indoor pictures  (b) a powerful flashlight that does a  great jobs under all circumstances. I normally works automatically, but can  be forced to flash, which gives really nice 'fill-in' light effects. (c)  incredible sharpness over the whole 'depth' of the picture. Nearby objects  (up to 3 inches, no kidding! ) and far away objects remain crystal clear  and sharp.  (d) a clear LCD that, after getting used to, is the best way to  take pictures (instead of putting the camear in front of your eye) (e) an  easy user interface on the camera to review pictures  (f) the TV cable is  just fun! It amazes people that you can see the pictures immediately on the  big TV screen.  (g) easy upload of JPEG files to attach to your emails.  With our family living in Europe this is a great feature that is really a  lot of fun. (h) The LCD screen shows the picture for 20 seconds after  taking it. This is a great feature on trips: Take a picture and show people  what it looks like and offer to send them it afterwards by email. It makes  friends quickly!Finally: if you're in the market today to buy a digital  camera, you have to realize the following. There are three price bands:  $300; $300-$550, and $550 and above. If you're a professional, you probably  do not read my review and you're in for the $550 and above category. If you  want 'something better than the rest', you should buy a camera of the  second category $300-$550. I warn you though, that cameras in that category  will decrease in price sharply and will cost only $300 in 12-15 months. So  my take is: buy a $300 camera. You will not be disappointed. And with the  Kodak DC215 you buy an amazing piece of equipment.", "Date": "July 15, 2000"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Camera in a millennium gold Package!", "Author": "Scott Anderson \"Sharpsburg\"", "ReviewID": "RO7RI3UFB6ZVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as an upgrade from my DC50 and have been in impressed with it every since I've opened the package.  The camera was ready to go within minutes of opening the box and the software was simple  to install and had me downloading pictures to my web site within ten  minutes.I purchased the DC215 millennium gold due to the larger compact  flash (8mg) and the inclusion of the USB compact flash reader.  Both  additions have made this an excellent camera.  I recently toured Harpers  Ferry National Battlefield and took several pictures of the surrounding  scenery as well as group photos, and amazed the group by displaying the  pictures on the T.V. via the direct camera link as soon as we returned  home.  They turned out crisp, detailed and in perfect focus!The camera  is a little hard on AA batteries so I went out and bought lithium batteries  and have not had to replace them in over three weeks of constant use.  Rechargeable might be the next step but right now I'm having way too much  fun with this camera and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a  megapixel on a modest budget.

The way I have  the camera set up, it takes 35 pictures at a very nice resolution and  quality on the 4MB Compact Flash card that is included.  I just bought the  16MB Flash because I'm using the camea so much, so keep in mind that at  some point you may be dropping another $40-50 on memory, as the amount that  comes with the DC-215 is passable, but not spectacular.", "Date": "July 25, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - but goes thru batteries like crazy!", "Author": "getawaysticks", "ReviewID": "R2GGLAG8J2SI77", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the Kodak DC 215 camera that was purchased before we went on our  honeymoon.

I set my upper limit at $300 for the camera and began shopping. I looked at everything from $39 to $500. I spent hours on the internet reviewing cameras. I also scanned the Sunday sale ads waiting for the right camera and price to come together. It did. I bought a Kodak DC215 for $299. Included with the camera was a SanDisk card reader. I was ready to take pictures.I shot a few pics the first day and uploaded them to the internet. How easy! Over the first few days I took more pics and continued to upload to my album. I also set it up where anyone could view the pictures and/or order prints. My family, 600 miles away, can only call once in a while and say hello, but can enjoy the pictures on the internet whenever they wish.After uploading about 50 pictures I decided to order prints online. I'd heard so much about \"resolution\" and \"recommended print size\" that I was scared that I'd get very grainy prints in the mail. What I received (using the lowest resolution on the camera for the prints) were wonderful, glossy, 4x6 prints. Every bit as good or even better than from 35mm film. I was amazed at the quality.I later purchased a 32MB card for about $70. It holds up to about 485 pictures. I'll use this card when we're on vacation. I couldn't be happier if I'd spent $999 on this camera. The only drawback - it takes only snapshots. If you want telephoto or wide angle, etc, get a good 35mm and use film.

At the time, I thought I was getting a bargain at around 220UKP, but have since seen the camera back in the UK for the same price.  I wasn't aware that you could get such a well featured digital camera for this kind of money.The camera has a versatile range of flash settings, including 'fill in flash', 'red eye reduction' and 'no flash.'  The 'exposure compensation' feature is very useful in poorly lit conditions, when the flash would be inappropriate or useless.  The camera also features a 10 second self-timer and a macro facility.  The biggest shock is battery consumption - in fact, if you use disposable alkaline batteries in the DC215, you'll probably find that the cost per picture is higher than buying and developing 35mm film!  A decent collection of NiMh rechargables is an essential accessory, but there's no need to buy the Kodak brand ones.  I wound up buying a couple of sets of Uniross 1300mAh NiMh batteries, which work very well.  There's no reason why you can't use NiCd batteries if you already have them, but if you're buying especially for the camera, then the NiMh batteries are well worth the extra cost.The features which I found annoying (most of which have already been mentioned) include the capacity of the standard memory card (4Mb) the slow download speed via the serial cable, the limited capabilities of the 2x optical zoom, and the fact that the 'zoom' facility in 'review' mode does not allow you to zoom in far enough to check the detail of the picture (which is supposedly the whole point of the facility.)  In review mode, the camera shows the pictures in two stages - a low resolution (and very blocky) image is shown instantly when a picture is selected and, if the picture is left on-screen for a short time, this is overwritten by the high-resolution version.  Unfortunately, the camera also operates in this way when viewing the pictures through the video out connector - so each picture in the 'slide show' is first shown in blocky low-res, and then updated to full resolution after a short delay.The camera features a conventional viewfinder, which is normally adequate for framing up pictures.  It is also possible to switch on the LCD for a real-time view of the picture to be taken, although this is best avoided if possible as it severely drains the batteries.Output quality is very good, provided that you set the resolution to high.  For each resolution, there are three possible quality settings, which affect the amount of JPEG compression applied to the picture files.  For the technically minded, 'Best' mode generates JPEGs with a quality setting of 94% - 'Better' and 'Good' use 85% and 75% respectively.  Even at 3x magnification (on the PC screen) it is difficult to see the difference between the 'Best' and 'Better' settings, and for normal (1x) viewing, the differences between the three qualities are unnoticeable.  A 16Mb card will store roughly 65 'Best', 90 'Better', and 135 'Good' pictures in high resolution mode.  The camera displays an estimate of the number of pictures remaining on the card (based on current compression and resolution settings) although this figure tends to be on the conservative side.One bonus of the design is that the serial and video connections use standard jack plugs, and the leads are simply straight-through cables.  I have already made two spare serial leads, so I can download the camera at home, at work, or on the move (into my notebook PC) without having to remember to bring the cable with me.  All in all, it's not the perfect camera, but it's not far off - the only things really missing from my 'wish list' are a more powerful optical zoom, a USB port, and a better 'detail' viewer in 'review' mode.

If the DC215 interests you, Kodak has a package called Digital Camera Expansion Pack that comes with (4) AA rechargable batteries, compact flash card reader (serial connection), PCMCIA adapter, and a 8MB compact flash card for less than $100. Bottom line in shopping for a digital camera. If money is not an issue, hell go with the Top of the Line model.

At 4x6 the pictures are very good (detail & color).  At 5x7 some pixelization begins to become apparent.  At 8x10 pixelization is very apparent on most pics.  If you're taking pics with little detail (portraits and flowers and such) 8x10s are acceptable when viewed from a few feet away.  The built in flash does a real nice job.  NiMH batteries are a must.  I also find that the brand and capacity of the batteries varies greatly and will give you from minutes to a few hours of serious use.  I find that Rayovac 1600mah batteries give me the best service.  Of course using the built in LCD screen greatly reduces battery life.  I recommend carrying a spare set (4).  An upgraded compact flash card is also a must.  At the best resolution I get 56 images on my 16M card.  I find the JPEG format easy do deal with in most photo application programs.  The only drawback is the serial interface cable.

The pictures are very sharp for it's one megapixel rating.  I have a 1200 X 1200dpi printer-I purchased a photo cartridge and I am amazed at the prints I am getting.  This camera recommends 5 X 7 enlargements for the best and highest resolution setting, but if you crop or save a picture with the Kodak Pictures Now Software (included with the camera) you can save it at the best and professional setting, and you will get some great prints-even 8 X 10. I think the color is dead on for outdoor shots.  I bought the lens adapter from Kodak that allows for 37mm screw on filters;  have UV, Polarizer, ND6, ND9, & FLD for flourescent light-if needed. But Kodak has a great lens coating on their lens; my indulgence in the extra filters was lagnaippe for me-many shots (most all) need no filter at all.  Kodak Pictures Now software is very good, enabling you to crop, set brightness or contrast, and has templates for printing single or multiple shots on a page, or different shots on a single sheet at a variety of different sizes to save paper. If you get the Kodak card reader the software with that is very good also, enabling you to do a bit more-you can even touch up those laugh lines (look ten years younger!) along with more detailed editing, and it offers templates for editing and printing as necessary.  I have Photoshop, and although it is useful, it can be time consuming and somewhat mind-boggling.  The software provided with the camera is good; the one with the cardreader gives you a little more to work with, and both are fast and easy to use. An important feature for me is the wide-angle lens (29mm-48mm Zoom) for landscape photography.  It is THE widest lens I have found (except for the Kodak 4800 digital-28mm) for a camera of this type and price-range.  Also, you can control exposure + or -2 stops in half step increments. It has a self-timer & video in/out to view on tv.  It is easy to program, installed easy on my computer.  You can store what seems like a zillion photos at the best & highest setting on a CD rom.  I also got 2 sets of NiMh rechargeable batteries and rechargers-always keep my extra set in my camera case.  I bought 2 extra 16mb picture cards; I can get over 50 pictures on one card at the best settings.To wrap this up, if you want to explore digital, (I've had my Canon F-1 for 23 years) but are skeptical because you are used to high-end 35mm SLR or larger format, this camera is a great one to start with.  Do not let the ISO, aperture, and shutter speed ranges fool you or stop you.  You can even take great night pictures-a favorite of mine-get the tripod-with a little available light.

It was my first digital anything (I still proudly carried my analog cam corder, kept my contacts in a paper address book, etc.), so I was very excited (being the technology buff that I am).  While boxy and a little on the heavy size, the camera really doesn't look bad at all.  Its nicely built as its survived a few perilous falls, however one of the rubber flaps has fallen off over a few years of use.The camera takes nice pictures for what you're paying for, however the zoom leaves much to be desired-expect to be huddled real close to your subject as you snap away.Another downside to this camera is its use of the serial port to transfer pictures.  This is extremely slow and takes a few minutes to even list the pictures on the camera (and if you've got more than 20 or so to transfer, go grab a cup of coffee).  There's no other options for transferring, so you're stuck in that aspect.  Don't buy this camera if you need to take a lot of pictures in a short amount of time... I'd say it takes at least fifteen seconds to store the picture after you snap it.A nice feature of the camera is its ability to be hooked up directly to a TV or VCR.  You can even have it run through the pictures as a slideshow.  The review feature and preferences menu on the camera is very nicely layed out, and you can easily view and delete pictures as you please.Overall this camera definetly gives you your money's worth.. however, if you're looking to take more than vacation and family pictures to stash away in your [on-line] album, I'd strongly suggest looking at other cameras.

To conserve batteries I had to turn off the LCD feature, making that nearly useless too* The close-up feature is totally useless because of how much juice it drains (unless you have an AC adapter)* to save as jpeg in Adobe PhotoDeluxe requires 7 clicks of the mouse and 30 seconds of time (multiply that hundreds of times and you get a frustrated user)* sometimes the camera acts like it has a mind of its own, turning on and off whenever it wants (but this is rare)* the camera programmers decided that the date/time has to be re-entered whenever the camera loses it, this can be really frustrating if you're trying to avoid using the LCD screen to save batteries* the lens cap wore out after a year and it no longer fits the lens, making it useless* the battery holder is still intact, but just barely", "Date": "July 24, 2003"}, {"Title": "Best bet for a starter/ first digital camera", "Author": "BB \"psbb\"", "ReviewID": "R2E4AU9MEGU7VE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first digital.

Delay after taking the picture.  This is the only real complaint I have.  It doesn't seem like it would be that bad, but if you want to take several shots of something in a row, you have to wait.  Kinda kills the moment. 2.  Batteries.  This was a complaint until I started buying NiMH batteries.  DON'T try it with NiCads -- just doesn't work.  And you might want to have some \"emergency\" Lithiums around too (though they are so expensive, I don't do that normally). 3.  I went for the gold, so I got an 8MB card, and it was too small.  So, I just bought a 16 MB card.  I rarely get it full, and if I do, I dig out the 8MB for the rest.  Or, I just get rid of the lousy pictures.  4.  Software -- since I never plug my camera in directly, I was dismayed that the software keeps complaining that I didn't plug in the camera.  So, I just copy all pics onto the hard disk and look at them with the default Microsoft picture viewer.  If need be, I clean them up with PhotoDraw 2000 (which is a total pain -- don't think you're getting anything if you get it).  We get by.
