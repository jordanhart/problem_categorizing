The onlydrawback with this camera is in hd mode you have a maximum recording timeof 10 minutes.  In lower quality mode you do not have that limit.  Thedigital stills are much better then my last Casio EZ-80, much richerand not as much noise.  But I bought this camera for the HD Video capability,it is amazing for the price.  Also this new movie format is AVI which isa lot more user friendly then the quick time mode of the EZ-80.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "A really poor camera and a very bad experience with Casio", "Author": "Peter Gaskill \"Wokn\"", "ReviewID": "R25B31RQVYX0Q5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was a hand-me-down from someone who used it only twice but purchased it brand new. It is one of the worst digital cameras I have ever used especially for the price. It takes very poor photos. We were having some trouble with it and contacted Casio to fix it. We spent almost $100 to have the lens replaced and when we received it back from Casio, the lens was still broken. I contacted the company 5 times to request that the camera be inspected again and finally received a UPS shipping label via e-mail in order to send the camera back. I am not only extremely disappointed in this camera, but I am extremely disappointed in Casio and their customer service and plan to not purchase any Casio products ever again.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect camera for your kids........", "Author": "K \"Drew\"", "ReviewID": "R2XY3S6WGXU415", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for the kids. It takes OK pictures but they love to make their own videos. I put in an 8GB card and they have a blast. They don't worry about download issues because we have a MAC so there are no issues with iPhoto. Plug it in and away it goes.I would not replace my Cannon with a Casio but for my kids, this is great. Picked up a few extra battery packs and we are all set.BOTTOM LINE: If you want a better camera, there are many out there but if you want a cheap camera with the ability to do video and allows for your own memory card, this cannot be beat.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Casio EX-Z90 12.1MP Compact digital camera.", "Author": "Wei", "ReviewID": "R1F5FWHIZ8HVEG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the simplest and compact camera I have used, it also has a a menu that is very easy to accessible, with much choices for most the situations and it produces excellent HIGH quality photos, comparable to some DSLR.This is one more excellent product from Casio, I have been using their products over 30yrs and  this just affirms my confidence with Casio products today.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!", "Author": "Denisse", "ReviewID": "RX2VMH5ZK1OHJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA YOU WILL REGRET IT!I fortunately I didn't spend money on this, I received this camera as a gift, from my sister when I my older Sony stopped working. I have to say out of 6 digital cameras I have own, This was the worst!!!The quality of photos are poor, especially at night, zoom is HORRIBLE!!You try zooming into something and the camera doesn't want to take a picture,is just so annoying, Especially if you want to catch a quick moment,  you have to click it like a 1000 times until it takes it. I've notice that it has trouble doing that, and if by miracle takes it,  most of the time is blurry or super grainy.I've this for about 3 years, but after less than a year of owning this and hating the quality, I bought the Canon XS260, the best digital camera I have own (look at the reviews if you don't believe me). It takes wonderful pictures and the zoom is amazing. The closest to a pro-camera without being one.But Oh well I forgot this is another review. I got that camera and unfortunately lost it few months later. and had to go back to this camera while I bought back that same one I had.And that just happen a few weeks ago and that gave me a big reminder of the awful quality this camera has, after having & comparing it to the Canon.Please! BELIEVE ME! They are other ones out there that are cheaper and WAYYYY better.I can don't really find any pros in this camera..Is awful.I'll definitely recommend any Canon or Nikon cameras...ONCE AGAIN.. Stay away from this one", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera.", "Author": "Donald E. Weiss", "ReviewID": "R8HSO3SYI6TX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little camera.

Gustavson", "ReviewID": "R2M2P2AK0MJVYU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst camera (analog or digital) I ever owned. I say it's sad and disappointing because its predecessor Casio EX-Z85 was a good experience. This one differs from it like day from night when it comes to making images. Worst image quality I've seen in any branded digital camera. Pics are extremely blurred (when viewed in actual size format in your computer), colors misrepresented and the focus makes the enviroment \"glow and flow\". You can but adjust this very slightly.Basically the pics you get with this camera are absolutely disastrous if you use any setting above 5MP. You can still try to use the 5MP option - if you don't use the zoom. If you want an ordinary relaxed and flexible use and get the \"best\" pics possible with this unit, then you can only go for 3MP or VGA mode. But hey, it's too little and too late. Ten years ago it might have been endurable but now it's only embarrasing to have this out on the shelves. Any budget prized cellphone with camera gets better pics than this one. Luckily this model is being phased out and taken off the market, so hopefully not too many customers will be scared off from Casio and Casio may improve their budget models.  I bought it real cheap at the last hour of its availability and I won't miss it when it's gone.However, I can say one positive thing about this camera, it does have a HD video mode function, which is pretty decent and a little, be it weak, comfort to this huge disappointment. You can get a max of 10 mins recording video time with this mode as well as with the YouTube, STD and LP modes (and then restart next 10 min session). But acceptable as that function is it's not any reason to buy this camera. Neither is the fact that it has a voice recording function. These stuffs are already all around elsewhere by now.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Never use software", "Author": "robert huber", "ReviewID": "R3QCITIVLGBI4I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had Nikons, Sony and Casio and all I can say is, NEVER use the software that comes with the camera.

Did not come with any cables to transfer your images off the camera to your computer!!  Are you kidding me!!  They provide a cable but it doesn't fit!  C'mon!  Other than that, it's a decent camera.

It's a nightmare!  We all transfer images to computer and rename them to something we can comprehend so we can find hem again.  But rename it on the memory card and you will never be able to view it via the camera - even tough it is there you are told \"File cannot be viewed\" - this tricks you into thinking the file is corrupt and you deleted perfect pics!Rename the file in your computer directory and copy import it back to the Camera and you loose the filename you can understand and it's renamed some absurd number = and round and round you go from absurdity to absurder.  When you again copy pics back to your computer  you will not have three pics with different file names only one of which can be viewed on the camera.  This confusion and inconsistency by design is maddening.  Product support is worse than bad.A wonderful camera but far, far, far too complicated.  Software replete with maddening design flaws make file management a nightmare.  Want to drive yourself totally out of your mind?  Then buy this camera.  If you want to avoid frustration, inconsistency, absurdity, get something else.  If you want to be driven nuts by convoluted software that delivers absurd results then this camera is four you.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Backlit Scene Shooting without setups\nPanning Auto Shutter", "Name": "Casio Exilim EX-Z90 12.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.7 inch TFT LCD (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uV23enmQL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002VA4EBI"}}
