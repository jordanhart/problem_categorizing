I wish the power supply would fit as snuggly.  It would be nice to have a longer cable but 4 1/2 I guess will just have to do.  I am happy with this cable purchase and I do recommend it to anyone that needs a replacement cable for their camera.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "quality product", "Author": "Larraine Smith", "ReviewID": "R1FMX7Q40PNM5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product works for me.
