I have also read that the Fi9818W did not have a mounting hole that was threaded the same as a camera, however on mine it is the same and I can mount this on a tripod if I wish.  The camera works OK, video quality is not spectacular, but if you are familiar with inexpensive security cams this should be no surprise.  The 2 way audio which was supposed to be improved over the older model is hit and miss, which really makes it pointless.  Additionally for firefox the vlc (videolan) plugin needs to be installed to get sound (IE can get it with a plugin from the manufacturer).  The pan and tilt functions do work well, though I have not found a way to set it up to patrol regularly.I can verify that this works with IPCamViewer on an android device, only bug with that app was that the L/R buttons were reversed (not a ding against Foscam however).Overall a cool toy, but the lack of I/O ports and the sound quality (or lack thereof) bring it down a couple stars.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera at a bargain price", "Author": "K. Dobson", "ReviewID": "RCO9E4DCNLEUI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this for our vacation house to serve several functions. When idle it is aimed at the front door including a view of the big screen TV. In the event of intrusion, it is set to email me multiple pictures giving me a better sense of security when we are away for weeks at a time. Also it comes in handy for a quick weather check. Mounted in a window frame, I can pan to the deck to see how much snow to expect on the way up in the winter. Only complaint is it creeps out the kids when they borrow the house. Whenever cabin in use I just aim it at the ceiling and shut it off. Overall very satisfied with the purchase.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for the price, not so great outdoor images", "Author": "Mark Druziak", "ReviewID": "R1SZ9JQZC8X5GL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, you do not get the webcam shown in the photos. You get the Foscam FI8918.  It looks pretty similar but it doesn't have the alarm ports on the back.Set up was easy enough.  I didn't install the software that comes with this cam.  I simply plugged the cam into my router, found the IP address on my network and used a browser (Google Chrome) to log in.  There is a lot of setup you need to do on your router if you are going to view this webcam from outside your house.  You will need to set up a static IP for the cam and then setup port forwarding.  You also should use a DNS service if your internet provider changes your modem's IP address from time to time (most do).Image quality of indoor images is good even in the dark.  Outdoor images are very washed out and the colors aren't that good.  I have since learned that if you want good outdoor images, you need to buy a web cam with an IR cut filter.  This cam does not have an IR cut filter.  I have this cam sitting in a window.  You can't use the night time illumination (IR LEDs) to light anything outside because the LEDs just reflect off the window.  Indoor image quality is good when lit by the IR LEDs.If the outdoor image quality were better, this would be a 5 star cam.  If all the stuff about the router set up sounds difficult to you, that is really the nature of any IP based web cam and there are some good tips and a forum on the Foscam site that should help", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works Good!", "Author": "Tech Gadget", "ReviewID": "R119Q77DPS89DO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm impressed!  The IP cam worked better than what I expected, good range of movement, nice night vision and sound and audio that works well with IE7.  Our first experiment for the Foscam was a petcam setup ...we always wondered what the dog did while we were away.  I can even turn-on the speaker and call to our little critter... got him all confused lol!  Easy to setup, I didn't even open the manual nor use the install disk... just followed hints from other reviews.  First, plugged the cam into the router and opened router configuration to find the cam's IP address.  Next, I logged onto the cam, configured user accounts and WiFi settings, disconnected the lan cable and presto... wireless cam found the router!  Then, I setup the cam with a free account on \"no-ip.com\" to view our petcam on the internet.  After allowing internet propagation of our new host setup on no-ip.com and port-forwarding, we now have petcam anywhere... fantastic!  Highly recommended and a great buy!Update7/22/2012; after 6 months of 24/7 use, the camera has an issue, locks-up about monthly and needs a power cycle reboot... somethings several to get the router to see the cam again... Which means reset the cam before leaving on vacation so the it stay up and running for as long as you are gone. I have two foscam but this cam seemed more problem pronged than the fixed foscam. Also, sound, mic and video record requires activeX to work... Meaning Windows only! Not a big issues. I like the alarm setting where the cam will email you clear pictures when it detects movement... Great for posting around the streets... \"Do you know this guy???\".  So, stlll works but with issues.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "it works!", "Author": "leahc117", "ReviewID": "R1W70PLT3M2QGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the foscam FI8918W to use as a baby monitor.

Even though this camera is an \"indoor\" model, I have it outdoors hanging from the underside of my eaves, pretty damn far away from my router, and it's working perfectly. I also utilized DDNS to port the camera's webpage to an external address, and it has worked beautifully. There's even a friggin' free Android app to watch your camera feed if you port the DDNS out. All this for like $50 or $60? That's a great deal. To anybody who gives this a negative view, please tell me what better deal you found. The Foscam even has built in motion detection.

I'm an IT guy and the wireless configuration and IP forwarding weren't too challenging for me, but I could see where it might be difficult to configure for some non-technical folks.  The good news is that the documentation, especially on the FOSCAM web site, was very helpful.  We accessed the web cam via the FoscamPro iPhone/iPad app, and the new version is superb!  We had no problem viewing the camera in real-time from across the Atlantic Ocean.  Picture quality was very good, and I was also very impressed with the IR (night vision) feature.

I've spent much more for similar cameras with fewer features. I did not install the software that came with it. I hooked it to the LAN, plugged it in, looked in the router for the IP that DHCP gave it, went to that IP in my browser, admin is the user, no password. You can also hit the WPS button on your router and hold the reset button on the bottom of the camera for 4 seconds (no longer) to set up wireless. You'll still have to find the IP that DHCP gave it.The firmware in the camera was actually HIGHER than the firmware updates offered on their site! huh?!The night vision is actually very good, I'm slightly impressed! I love the ability to turn the IR off and on via web interface or my cell using IP Cam Viewer (Robert Chou). Dark colors are grainy and full of noise, average ambient light has washed out colors, and good light equals good picture. It records video by itself, without audio, providing it has a place to save it. It records audio and video if you have it open in Internet Exploiter with the audio turned on.The microphone is pretty sensitive, and while I'm glad there is actually a built-in speaker it's barely audible most of the time, but it's got input and output on the back of the camera for external audio equipment.The pan and tilt were VERY slow at first, because in settings 0 = Very Fast and 15 = barely noticeable movement. The start up of the camera goes through a rather lengthy \"calibration\" of the pan and tilt, but it accurately returns to position #1 after a power cycle.The interface in anything but IP Cam Viewer and Internet Exploiter is rather lacking, audio is possible in Firefox according to the brief link: \"If you want to add audio,you can download plugin from [...] but I didn't find the plugin they were referring to, I didn't look very hard either.

You may think that from the momment you have to call support it is already a pain but let me tell you this: I got this nice lady name Sandra and she was great! She really understands what your problem is, goes straight to the point and if you want, she can do everything remontly, from updating the firmware to make the camera go life on wireless and the internet.

Now with all that said and done because some modem change ip addresses i needed to get my own with is call a static ip address lmao. Yea i learned all this in two days. So after a new modem a new router witch i bought myself and i had to buy a static ip address witch was 20 bucks a month though my internet company, i then thank god have 24hr 7day a week teck support though my company. Now remember i know nothing about hooking up anything. Some people say you just hook it up and thats all haha i would love to meet those people. ok all in all i spent 90 for the cam 80 for the router and 20 a month though my internet provider for the static ip address. Well tech support was free for me if you need tech support you are going to be one pissed off person with what companys are charging for that.
