{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Does the job.", "Author": "NZgirl", "ReviewID": "R2FGQD4O0W24DX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I am planning to take a backpacking trip to New Zealand in a couple of months, and wanted something that could take a bit of a beating while I'm out there. When I am kayaking, I want to be able to take a camera out with me. I am also about to go parasailing, so I got the camera now so that I could test it out on the water.I had originally planned on taking a very expensive DSLR to NZ, but was convinced otherwise because it is extremely heavy for a backpacker, and I would also probably eventually end up breaking it. Instead of breaking a very expensive camera, I bought this camera, for $100, at this link:http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-Waterproof-Digital-Floating-Accessory/dp/B004WSLZ5U/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid;=1342658199&sr;=8-5&keywords;=coleman+digital+cameraEven though I bought the camera in a kit instead of from this page, I thought I should write the review here because the camera seems to be taking quite a beating from reviews of people who probably didn't understand the camera.First of all, this camera is NOT a camera for people who are serious photographers looking for high quality shots. You don't buy a camera for $100 and expect it to take professional photos. It's pretty simple. If you are looking for something like that, you might want to up your budget for a camera by about $1,000.00. I knew that when I bought it. That said, there are a few things you need to expect if you buy this. First of all, there IS a delay between the time you press the button for a photo, and the time it takes the photo. This isn't a particularly big issue for me. Also, the image quality isn't the best, but it does the job I wanted it to do. Another note is that photo quality is generally better outdoors than indoors. However, I was able to get decent shots.When I turned on the camera, I was surprised to realize that it actually has a menu that lets you change the ISO, exposure,IMAGE QUALITY, white balance, and it also has several types of flash that you can use, which greatly change the quality of the photo. Many people have complained about poor photo quality, but if they would just take the time to change some settings, they would get a much better photo.I saw one complaint on the reviews about how hard it was to shut the door to the battery pack. It isn't difficult. If you try to just shut the door, it will not do it easily. However, there is a lever on the door- all you have to do is hold it back, and the door shuts easily. It might be a little tricky the first time to break it in, but I didn't have any issues. I might also add, I am a girl who is not very strong.Personally, I  would rather have a sturdy door than one that opens easily and exposes the battery and memory card to water.Another complaint was that the microphone flooded. Here's a trick- use the plug. Problem solved.I used this camera in water and it was fine. If you are expecting excellent photos in the water, DON'T USE IT IN MURKY WATER. If you get icky photos because of it, it's not the camera's fault. It's your own dang fault because you took a photo of murky water. If you want crystal clear photos, get a water purifier.One reviewer commented that you couldn't get sound unless you plugged in a microphone. Not true. YOU DO NOT NEED TO PLUG IN A MICROPHONE. If you take the plug off the microphone, you WILL record sound. You will not hear it though until you load the video onto your computer. Why? Because its STUPID to put a speaker on a camera that is supposed to go underwater.One other complaint from a reviewer was this: \"The \"extra\" battery that came with the kit doesn't fit the camera properly. It is a generic battery that pops out every time you try to charge the thing.\" -JessicaHow about turning the battery, Jessica? If you put the battery in the wrong way, it WILL pop out. It's to let you know that the battery is in wrong. I put it in wrong at first, but then I turned it around and guess what? It stayed in. EPIPHANY.All in all, this camera does what I want it to. I didn't expect professional photographs- it's a cheap camera. I will certainly miss my DSLR while I am in NZ, but it wouldn't stand a chance. This Coleman camera IS rugged. I also liked the blue color that I got. It was pretty. Except for the one, maybe two, reviews I saw about the camera having a defect, most of the reviews I saw were simple things that people could have figured out, had they simply taken the time to learn about the camera.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't listen to the rest", "Author": "Toby Keathley \"Pastor T\"", "ReviewID": "R38H3SH1U4U0MA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im not sure what camera was used in some of these negative reviews, but it's definitely not this one.

That being said:This is the worst product I have found in a long time. We have a family vacation coming up, and we wanted to get a camera that we can use for underwater. We researched a few cameras, and decided to go with this one. There was only one review on the whole web, and now I know why. This thing is a piece of work.First off...you can't shut the door that leads to the battery and memory card. I have tried to even knock it on the table and it just won't close. It closes when it wants. I am happy to see they take \"water proof\" seriously, but it would be nice to be able to open and shut that door, especially when the charging port is in that door as well. We have been trying all night to close the door back up, and can not do so.The picture quality is bad. I haven't used it in the water yet (plan to this weekend), but I took a few indoor pics (with flash), and they looked worse than when I take them on my phone camera (a G1 google outdated phone).It is sturdy, but cheaply made. I know, you get what you buy; and that we did. The shipping was way too high for it taking 6 days to get here (when I paid extra ($20)for expedited mail). I ordered stuff directly from amazon at the same time and paid significantly less and they both showed up on the same day, same time.The \"extra\" battery that came with the kit doesn't fit the camera properly. It is a generic battery that pops out every time you try to charge the thing. You have to sit it in the right position and DO NOT TOUCH IT or it will pop out and won't charge.I will write more when I try it in the water.Ok, so now I have used it multiple times in and out of the water. This is an outdoor camera. Do not buy this if you take mostly indoor shots. You will be very disappointed. As I mentioned before, the flash sucks. It is a very weak flash, and it either over exposes the picture or way under exposes it.As for underwater...I have tried it in the crisp clear Lake Superior, some semi-murky lakes, and a couple pools. When I used it in the lakes you couldn't see anything. When I used it in the pools you couldn't get a clear shot ever. It takes a long time to take one picture, and by the time it shoots you don't have any breath left so all you see is a blur of a person. Those disposable underwater cameras work better than this camera. Even if you have it on sport you can't get a clear shot unless you tell the person you are shooting to stand really still and don't breath until the camera takes the picture.The video quality is decent for a digital camera. We got some really cool cliff jumping videos with this camera in Lake Superior. The only thing that really sucks is when you use the camera for video there is no sound. There is a plug to plug in a microphone, but the sound is basically non-existent. You can hear the zooming in and out very well. It clicks really loud in your video. That is all you can hear. You can't use the plug if you are near water as it may seep into the camera and ruin it. So if you want sound it has to be on dry land.Overall, I hate it less than I did when I opened the package, but I still am very disappointed in this product. I don't write reviews often for items, but this was worthy of warning people of what you are buying. Don't buy it. Get a disposable underwater camera if you want to take water pictures. Don't spend $100 on this product!", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy", "Author": "cpacosta", "ReviewID": "R57ZWUD2AYXAQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was a major disappointment.

I understand many complaints are due to 'operator incompetence', and wanted to like this camera, but sadly, it's just not a well made piece of photographic equipment. We bought this for a vacation with plans to do some snorkeling/beach combing. The camera did so great until the day before we left, and then totally 'crapped out' on us. I think the biggest problem is the hatch for the battery/SD card. It's very hard to effectively close the thing. My wife (who has considerably less finger strength than I) couldn't even get it to shut, and it took me a while to really get it to snap proper (and I play bass, for the love of cripes). We did get some great underwater pics/video (fair quality picture and sound for a low-end camera) and some great outdoor shots, but I think moisture/humidity builds up in the not-quite-sealed compartment hatch, and that's what killed it. I believe this would be great for camping or other non-aquatic photos (just take some time getting to know the beast, and I assure you, you'll get some great shots), or for a kid, but isn't all that great for water. The deepest we took this thing was about 10 feet, so it really should not have met such a premature demise. That's a shame, Coleman has never let me down before, and perhaps they should just stick to what they do best- camping equipment. We probably would've been just as well off to have gotten a disposable u.w. camera. A five day shelf life is unacceptable for this. Seek another brand. I do, however, commend Amazon for their rapid response/refund time.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terrible Camera With The Coleman Brand Name!!", "Author": "MS Pitt \"mspitt10\"", "ReviewID": "R2JJZ7FK3984FQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've never had a poor or bad Coleman outdoor product until I purchased this camera (Model No. C5WP Red).  I find it hard to believe that Coleman associates its name and brand reputation to this camera.  All photos taken with it are blurry and very grainy.  Don't even think about it's video capabilities, they are even worse.  It says this is a 12 mega pixel camera but it takes all photos, regardless of lighting conditions, as if it were back in the old days of 1 and 2 mega pixel cameras.  Very poor quality.  It might be good for young children learning how to use a camera but for nearly $100, it's too expensive.

Canham", "ReviewID": "R3MVKXAXLOPFJW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "30 October 2013:  On 8 Oct, Elite e-mailed me that they don't have the blue camera and if I wanted blue (which I do), I'd have to wait 2-3 weeks.  As of today, they've not contacted me and still no camera, but it's only been 3 weeks.4 October 2013:  Update: Amazon never responded.  I called Coleman who would not help me and referred me to E-lite Brands: 800-441-1100, who told me to mail the camera and $10 check and they'd repair it or replace it.  We'll see.  So, don't expect much customer support.  Also, I could not find the manual in an electronic version anywhere (Elite said they don't have it electronically.)1 October 2013:  A quick note:  The buttons on the back of the camera broke inside their rubber casing last week, about 6 weeks after I purchased the camera.  I had only used it about 8 days.  I e-mailed Amazon for help, as the 30 return policy was over.  I will update this as I learn new info.  So, bottom line is, it takes decent photos if you learn how to use it, but it is not a good quality camera, which should be obvious based on the price for a camera rated to 30 feet below the surface.The following is my original review:September 2013:First off, many thanks to NZ Girl for her honest and VERY useful review.  She prompted me to buy this camera and her review will save you many headaches.  So, read her review and learn.I just returned from a week in Jamaica and here's my results.I took over 850 photos, some above water but the most below.I would estimate that about 60% of photos came out blurry, faded, or otherwise poor quality.That said, the other photos were very nice.I took photos snorkeling and scuba diving.The battery appears to have lost some life and doesn't last as long as it did when I first started using it.This camera is well worth the money, as long as you'd like to be able to take underwater photos for an inexpensive price.  Just remember to take 4-5 photos of everything and you'll have enough good photos that you'll be pleased.When I dove the camera worked well until about 30 feet or so, which is how deep the camera is rated.  When I went below that depth it just wouldn't work.  That didn't bother me at all.I took some videos and they came out very nice.  I added a couple of my photos to the product page.I shot some photos on Macro setting, but that setting didn't appear to make a difference.The bottom line for me is that this camera is a good buy, just don't expect to take action shots (mine all came out blurry) but some of the other shots will be very good if you hold the camera still.The tiny manual is printed in very small font and is not very informative.Over all, it's worth the cheap price, even if it a pretty lousy camera and customer support is poor.  I got some nice photos in the end and so I'd say but it - but don't expect a high quality camera.  I figure if I can use it for 2-3 vacations, I'll be happy.  Then maybe the good underwater cameras will have dropped in price so I am willing to buy one of them.I bought a 8GB card and it holds over 5,000 photos.  So, you won't run out of space for your photos.Take multiple shots of everything and you'll be pleased some of the results.Oh, when above water, wipe off the lens for a clearer photo.And, finally, this camera floats quite well.Buy, swim and enjoy.I did.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Water...Water...Water", "Author": "James R.

The performance was acceptable for a product at this price, except for the video (sounds like your in a tunnel).

I could take quick snap shots whenever I wanted and didn't have to worry about splashes or being dunked or anything.... Or so I thought...  We had just planned our diving trip for the following day and we went back to the pool for some drinks and fun.  After wading around for about half an hour I picked it up for a quick shot and noticed the battery door wide open and full of water!  Apparantly the design for the latch of the 'water tight' battery door has a fatal flaw, the plastic springloaded locking mechanism only just barely snaps the hatch closed and the slightest movement or bump opens it.  This design never should have made it past product testing..

I don't see how this has bad reviews. The battery compartment is a little hard to get to shut completely the first few times but you need to have some brains to figure that you need to press hard to get it to snap shut and after you get it snapped shut, its no trouble!

Great product, does everything it says and recommend this product!!!", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buy at your own risk!!", "Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "R3KJ43OM5ZW3X2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that everything I have ever bought from Coleman has been very reliable and trustworthy. That being said:This is the worst product I have found in a long time. We have a family vacation coming up, and we wanted to get a camera that we can use for underwater. We researched a few cameras, and decided to go with this one. There was only one review on the whole web, and now I know why. This thing is a piece of work.First off...you can't shut the door that leads to the battery and memory card. I have tried to even knock it on the table and it just won't close. It closes when it wants. I am happy to see they take \"water proof\" seriously, but it would be nice to be able to open and shut that door, especially when the charging port is in that door as well. We have been trying all night to close the door back up, and can not do so.The picture quality is bad. I haven't used it in the water yet (plan to this weekend), but I took a few indoor pics (with flash), and they looked worse than when I take them on my phone camera (a G1 google outdated phone).It is sturdy, but cheaply made. I know, you get what you buy; and that we did. The shipping was way too high for it taking 6 days to get here (when I paid extra ($20)for expedited mail). I ordered stuff directly from amazon at the same time and paid significantly less and they both showed up on the same day, same time.The \"extra\" battery that came with the kit doesn't fit the camera properly. It is a generic battery that pops out every time you try to charge the thing. You have to sit it in the right position and DO NOT TOUCH IT or it will pop out and won't charge.I will write more when I try it in the water.Ok, so now I have used it multiple times in and out of the water. This is an outdoor camera. Do not buy this if you take mostly indoor shots. You will be very disappointed. As I mentioned before, the flash sucks. It is a very weak flash, and it either over exposes the picture or way under exposes it.As for underwater...I have tried it in the crisp clear Lake Superior, some semi-murky lakes, and a couple pools. When I used it in the lakes you couldn't see anything. When I used it in the pools you couldn't get a clear shot ever. It takes a long time to take one picture, and by the time it shoots you don't have any breath left so all you see is a blur of a person. Those disposable underwater cameras work better than this camera. Even if you have it on sport you can't get a clear shot unless you tell the person you are shooting to stand really still and don't breath until the camera takes the picture.The video quality is decent for a digital camera. We got some really cool cliff jumping videos with this camera in Lake Superior. The only thing that really sucks is when you use the camera for video there is no sound. There is a plug to plug in a microphone, but the sound is basically non-existent. You can hear the zooming in and out very well. It clicks really loud in your video. That is all you can hear. You can't use the plug if you are near water as it may seep into the camera and ruin it. So if you want sound it has to be on dry land.Overall, I hate it less than I did when I opened the package, but I still am very disappointed in this product. I don't write reviews often for items, but this was worthy of warning people of what you are buying. Don't buy it. Get a disposable underwater camera if you want to take water pictures. Don't spend $100 on this product!", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera destroyed after first snorkel trip", "Author": "GLEN G BATEMAN", "ReviewID": "R1WP3VAMKI60EL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Went snorkeling for the first time with the new camera.

What we got instead is a 100% totally useless POS - nothing.  It worked great indoors with a flash, but as soon as the flash is turned off and used outdoors, every single picture is blurry - close up or distant, cloudy or sunny. We found the images look good on the camera's small lcd and thought nothing of it. They look great as small, medium, & large thumbnails in windows.

I bought the Coleman C5WP and 8GB micro card on faith, configured the camera on the airplane and put it to use when we landed in Grenada.  The directions are a little sketchy, but just go through the menu choices to set up the camera.  The package also includes a VERY IMPORTANT notice to be sure that the battery door is properly closed and the microphone port is plugged before you get the camera wet.  Now you're ready to go swimming.I found that the buttons were easy to find and use underwater.  The screen display is fairly large but the digital image is not very visible underwater.  I only checked the display underwater to make sure the camera was on before I took a shot.  If you have the anti-shake function on, be patient when clicking a shot - it may take a full second for the camera to take a picture.  On land I would recommend turning the anti-shake function off.Two things to avoid; don't get too close to your subject because the autofocus won't focus if you are too close.  Experiment with the camera beforehand to find the right distance.  Also forget the digital zoom function even with a tripod.  This is a point-n-shoot camera; my other camera with an optical zoom is far superior for zoom-in shots.The Coleman C5WP produced some good shots as long as the subject was evenly lit (bright glare and dark shadows are a problem).  Also, be sure to clean the camera with fresh water after exposing it to sea water which forms a film of salt on the lens.I had no problems with repeated use in salt water.  The battery held a charge for several hours if you use the 3-minute auto-shutoff option.  Just be sure the camera is on when you want to take a picture.The Coleman C5WP is a decent camera for the money, better than disposable cameras.  The lens is wide-angle which is good underwater but tends to distort images on land.  With practice it will be a functional, reliable camera for snorkeling.  Just don't expect postcard quality photos.

Very difficult to figure out how to do everything, from viewing pictures just taken to getting the battery compartment closed.  It comes with no memory card so be sure to add that price on and its microSD and can only take up to 8GB.  After 2 uses at the beach, the camera started leaking.
