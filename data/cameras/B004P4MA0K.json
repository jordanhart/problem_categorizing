So I wanted to make sure none of the smoke detectors, plugs, etc had any funny business going on. I scanned the whole place, after darkening the room according to instructions, and everything was \"clear.\" What a relief, right? Not so fast!Just to test and make sure it was working, I put my camera on a shelf, set it to record and scanned over it. The Detector showed NOTHING! I tried my cell phone too, set it to recording, held the Detector right next to it, scanned, nothing... This prodcut is basically useless and an utter waste of money. I'm pretty disappointed. :-(", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't Waste Your Money", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R5M60FIJR7P8Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "About the only thing it would detect is my wifi home network.

Be sure to use the camera detector in as dark a room as possible. It's just easier to see the reflected red light. The detector is very small, fits in a bag, and can be used quickly.
