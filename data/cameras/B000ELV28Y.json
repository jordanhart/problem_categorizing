One I gave to my daughter who took over 5000 images with it, the other I still use, having passed the 6000 image mark.  They are great for photographing small objects to be sold on Ebay.Don't worry about it only being 3 megapixels.  Megapixels are a sales gimmick meant to sway your purchase decisions.  Concentrate on the color that a cameral can deliver, and base your megapixel decision on how big a picture you need to print.Pros:  Has TIFF format which produces a 9 meg file.  JPG files start at 1 meg and smaller in four image sizes.  Image color is very accurate without exagerated color.  Macro close focus is about 1 inch away, with a great deal of depth that is in focus.  To get that depth of field, bump the zoom slightly off wide. Flip the camera upside down and the lens edge is about 1/10 of an inch off the surface.  Uses SD cards.Optical viewfinder.Movie mode is Apple Quicktime.Can be used as a voice recorder.Decent software included on a CDGreat lens and image chip combination, no color fringing that I have spotted.Lens stays inside the body of the camera.All metal construction.Negatives:  By 2008 standards it has a small screen.  It does not have anti shake / image stabilization so you want to brace it against something in low light.Not a super perfomer in dark situations.Self timer has to be invoked each time you want to take a delayed shot.You will want to get it for less than 100 dollars with a second battery and spare SD card.  For 100 you can get an 8 megapixel Fuji from WalMart that has the great CCD chip.  Also for 100 dollars you can get a 6 megapixel Panasonic with a wide angle zoom with Leica lens, optical image stabilization that also uses SD cards.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Meh", "Author": "Samantha", "ReviewID": "R2GWXPJO1I5SRO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wish that they had said up front that it did not come with a charger or battery. You are literally just buying a camera with nothing else, this would have been fine if it hadn't also been in crappy condition. You could still see where someone had written on it in marker, and it had scratches on both the screen and the camera itself. I'm not sure what I expected when I paid so little for it though. You get what you pay for, so if you want a decent camera just pay for a good one.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera", "Author": "Abbas Jaffary", "ReviewID": "R38RHLYAW1RIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned this camera back in 2004 and loved it.  It was ahead of its time - super compact, like a stack of credit cards, RAW/TIFF image capture capability, super fast load/save times, excellent image quality and a very simple, efficient interface.  Sadly, after dropping this camera one too many times, it gave up - but I just purchased another one used on amazon.  This camera will serve about 80% of my needs - snapshots and sale items, and I can carry it everywhere b/c it's tiny.  I've considered the Canon ELPH 300/310 series as a replacement, which are in the $200 range and the only cameras that for me satisfy those features.  If you don't mind a gamble on used items, this camera won't disappoint.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "broken", "Author": "Corey Alexander \"Corey\"", "ReviewID": "R3UDBYJUJDCT2V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "piece of crap, arrived completely broken, seller ignored me - do not do business with them", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Minolta Dimage Xt 3.2 Megapixel Digital Camera (USA)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412z8SwncKL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000ELV28Y"}}
