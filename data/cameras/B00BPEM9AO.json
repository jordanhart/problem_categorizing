My husband is new at this so I wanted something simple to use but with the capability for personal improvement. This was an excellent choice and he loved it. I purchased it for Farther's Day. The company was great, everything ordered came intact and it even got here just in time for the occasion.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$734.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Red) + <2> Nikon 55-200mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Battery Grip for D3100 & D3200 +\n<4> PD Laptop/Tablet DSLR Backpack + <5> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card + <6> Spare EN-EL14 Battery + <7> Battery Charger +\n<8> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <9> Additional Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <10> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control + <11> HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable +\n<12> HB-45 Lens Hood + <13> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <14> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <15> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Red) with 55-200mm VR Lens + 32GB Card + Case + Battery & Charger + Grip + HDMI Cable + Filters Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/6182Nu4JruL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BPEM9AO"}}
