Sooo easy to use.The view finder screen makes things simple too.The Sony  is lighter, it has adjustable settings or can shoot full auto = (simple point & shoot). It is 20mp & takes awesome pics..!!She is doing pics of our birds on the feeders with the zoom lens & night shots w/ the tripod in the snow w/ std. to wide angle lens... then looking at them & cropping them on the computer.She wants to frame some for home artwork ...... all in 30 days..!! She loves it.We received the entire kit package w/ both lenses for around $550.ish.  I have over $3k in my Olympus w/ less stuff & they both take quality pictures. I did apx. 10 hours on line research & looked at some in person at a few stores, The best deal I could find anywhere.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great purchase!", "Author": "Carlos Francisco Saravia Jimenez", "ReviewID": "R1EBWKDVTMN38Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At this moment, work very welll.
