I just love it, i bought the purple and its so pretty. The quality of the photos and video are amazing. I have no regrets buying this camera. my money was well spent. The only cons about it is i find its alittle slow but i guess i could put it into burst mode if i need pics taken 1 right after the other. But i have no regrets having this piece of joy. im still testing the other modes but so far so good. Also pictures taken at nights are excellent", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works with my imac/snow leopard/iphoto!!!!!!!", "Author": "Jake Reynolds \"Jake\"", "ReviewID": "R1YE104P5YPH16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have just purchased the camera and must share my joy to discover that THIS CAMERA WORKS WITH MY iMAC AND IPHOTO.  YEAH!!!  My previous 3-4 cameras would not work with the mac, then i had to mess with the SD card with only 20% success rate - A TOTAL NIGHTMARE every time.  I'll revise the review later but I wanted to share in case other people had the same issues with the mac and photos.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "She loves it.", "Author": "faw43", "ReviewID": "R2SCKK6RAP88GL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for my daughter.She loves the features and the large viewing screen.I liked the price for what she got.Would recommend to friends.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it and the color!", "Author": "Rhonda Davis \"Tawanda Rocks\"", "ReviewID": "R1QY34QC1NMAR0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched and reviewed customer reviews and then repeated the process for almost a year. I am not disappointed at choosing this camera. It is small enough to be kept with me and easy enough to use for quality shots as quickly as I can point it towards the subject. The color is my favorite so it's an added bonus for me. Besides, I wanted something other than black so it would be easy to find and identify. This fits the bill on all counts.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great photos in a small, convenient unit", "Author": "Brian Casey", "ReviewID": "RSH1JV9NAFRHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife forgot to pack her bigger, bulkier camera for a long road trip, so we ordered this one and had it shipped to a mid-point hotel along the way.  (My wife is a purple-person, so she loves the color.)  The optical zoom works really well for a small, relatively inexpensive P&S;, and the low-light photos are better than expected.  MicroUSB charging makes it easy to find a charger. Overall, an excellent value in a small, inexpensive camera.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "An excellent \"point and shoot\"", "Author": "W.S.", "ReviewID": "RS66Y15CVLKW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have owned both Nikon and earlier Samsung models, but this is the best so far for the investment. The photos are clear, crisp, and the colors are bright and true. The only issue was the microchip (not included w/purchase) The chip I purchased came with an adapter which would not function with any card reader...ended up buying a reader which would take the chip straight away, and was then able to download all my photos.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ok for a point and shoot", "Author": "Dean Hamilton", "ReviewID": "R2DG8NPCX0ONKR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a fan of Samsung products, generally speaking.  This camera is pretty good for a point and shoot.  I didn't like the limitations of the small lens, the menus, not really user friendly.But, I did love that I didn't need a proprietary cord for downloading.  Universal USB cord for uploading is the way to go.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "anne marie nordbo", "ReviewID": "R1UUOG5TF8ACP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love, love the camera.

I first ordered this on 7/23/13, it was delivered on 7/24/13 with my amazon prime.  Opened the amazon box to find the camera box inside had already been opened.  There is a silver seal on the camera box that was slit open.  Apparently it may have been a returned product?  I don't know why it was already opened, but regardless of the reason, clearly not a \"brand new\" as advertised or giftable product.  So I contacted amazon, explained the issue, they issued a refund but told me I would have to reorder myself, as this product is offered by Electronics Basket, only fulfilled by amazon.  So, I proceed to order again on 7/24/13.  Repackaged & took the first camera to the local ups store to return on 7/26/13, only to get home & find the second one on the porch.  Opened it up and exact same thing, if anything, this one was in worse condition, with the box tab flap actually undone, as well as the factory seal slit open, just like the first one.  Again, NOT a \"brand new\" unopened product, as advertised!!  Again, had to communicate with amazon to get refund & again repackage & return.  Not to mention, the event that I was planning to give this gift at, took place on Saturday 7/27/13, so I had no choice by to go shopping at the last minute to purchase a replacement gift.All in all, a terrible experience with this Seller.  I highly recommend if you actually want to purchase a new unopened camera, that you DO NOT purchase it from this Seller!!  On the other hand, if the camera is for you, and you do not care that it may not be a brand new unused camera that they are sending, well the camera itself is a good camera.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$169.99", "Features": "Clearer shots in the dark - F2.5 Bright lens\nCapture a vision that's clearer and wider - 16 Mega Pixels /5x/25mm\nIt remains perfectly still even if you don't - OIS (Optical Image Stabilization)\nWhen it comes to brightness, it's brilliant - 3.0\" hVGA LCD\nHD movies in the palm of your hand - HD 720p, 30fps", "Name": "Samsung ST88 Digital Camera - 16mp - 5x Optical Zoom - Purple", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HyqmEZGVL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008K85I0Q"}}
