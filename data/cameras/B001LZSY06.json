Giovannetti", "ReviewID": "R3C6HACE8EGCAI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "IntroductionI purchased the Astak Mole camera to try one out; it is my first IP camera ever, so keep that in mind.  After performing a lot of research on IP cameras, I realized the main issues with them were dropping of wireless connections and night vision performance.  I am only using a wired ethernet connection, but the night vision performance is somewhat important; the camera is intended for use in my children's bedrooms at night.Before I found the Mole at a warehouse club with a great return policy, the top candidate for use in the kid's rooms was the Foscam FI8908W (aka cam0011), since the night vision performance was listed as 0.5 Lux.  The Foscam is much cheaper than this unit, but it was a no-brainer for me to try out the mole, given the no-hassle return policy.Camera SetupI did not use the YOICS service or the setup CD.  I am fairly tech-oriented, but also found some instructions on the internet and a youtube video on how to set it up manually, which gave me a confidence boost!  Basically, you plug in the camera to your network and locate the IP address assigned by the DHCP server.  Next, you log in directly to the camera's web page for setup.  I am only using wired, not wireless.Night VisionI have noticed upon researching the mole camera (after purchase), that the Lux specifications for the night vision are not listed anywhere that I could find.  My testing thus far (in a completely darkened kitchen) reveals pretty good night vision performance at up to ten feet away.  I did not test further than that, as the kids' rooms are not that big, but want to try it outside also, by setting it near a window.Audio PerformanceThe audio performance seemed good to me when testing in our kitchen.  This is an important attribute for me, given the intended use.Motion DetectionThe built-in motion detection seems to be really sensitive, but I did not try playing with the default settings.  Motion detection is not too important for me, so I did not invest a lot of time in trying to improve it from the default settings.Browser PerformanceI tested out the camera's web interface on Internet Explorer 7 (Windows XP) via a wireless (N) laptop and a wired desktop.  I also tested it out on Safari (Snow Leopard) via an iMac with a wired gigabit connection.  Interestingly, Safari did not perform as well when viewing the camera live feed; the audio/video was delayed and the camera's response to commands (pan/tilt) was slow.  IE7 worked much better in this regard.  It did seem to freeze when left on overnight (requiring a page refresh), but I only think this happened on IE when using the wireless laptop.ConclusionOverall, I think this is a pretty nice camera (for my first IP camera), and think I will keep it; I can return it at any time.  I will do some more testing before trying it out in the kid's rooms at night.  The IE freezing issue may a problem, but that may be an issue with my wireless laptop.  My monitoring plan for multiple moles is (eventually) to utilize DVR software, so it remains to be seen how the mole will work with the DVR software I purchase.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazingly Easy to Set Up and Use", "Author": "Adoptive Dad", "ReviewID": "R3K61H16GL223J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a winner.  Unboxed it, followed the quick start guide (hook up the network cable BEFORE the power cord) and installed software for initial setup.

You can hook up a set of speakers to it and turn on the microphone that is built in for 2 way conversations (if desired) to the area you are monitoring.  Pan and tilt worked great and with user defined HOME setting that brings the camera back to center on what ever area is most important to you.  This camera really works great and watches the entire livingroom / dining area easily.  The infrared works surprisingly well since I have had other infrared illuminated cameras with so-so results.

All of my difficulties were in setting up the e-mail feed and the FTP feed, but that is not really the camera's fault.  More diagnostics would have made it easier.If I have any complaints, it would be that the camera does not have a setting to turn off all of the LED indicators on the camera.  That makes it hard to install an unobtrusive camera if it flickers whenever it senses motion.  Fortunately, by the time some vandal sees the camera and grabs it, the images will have been safely uploaded.  We'll see how errant animals react to the camera.

The camera detection software won't pick up the camera, but I am able to view it and control it by entering the IP address in my browser. It works great in Internet Explorer 9 on one of my computers, but it won't connect on the other. However, I was able to get it up in Firefox after tweaking the Quicktime settings as explained in the camera setup guide. Setting up the wireless connection was a snap (after I realized I needed to attach the antenna!). Night vision works well indoors, but doesn't really work through a window if you want to see outdoors at night. The microphone is very sensitive, so it's easy to hear what's going on.

I have owned my Mole for 18 months and so far I can honestly say it has been a good choice for my needs.  The camera connects to my internet connection through my wireless router, and that made installation a snap with no wires to run... just place the camera near a power plug.  The Mole software allows me to access the camera using any PC.  I am also able to view or operate it from my Android phone although there is not an Android specific application yet written for it.  The user has the ability to set up motion sensing and can define specific areas of the screen with a \"box\".  Any movement within the defined area will trigger the camera to start recording, and send a message to my phone with a picture of what it saw.  Further, the Mole will send the video it records to your Youtube account if you desire.  I love that feature!  I simply set up a private youtube account and send all video there, when I am not at home, the camera warns me of anything it sees and after looking at the attached photo, I can go to youtube from my smartphone and view the video.  On several instances I was able to not only keep an eye on my apartment complex's maintenance personnel while they worked inside my apartment, but was able to listen in on their conversation as well.If you are looking for a simple solution to monitor a home or office I think the Mole is a good choice for the price...  It offers a simple setup, adequate tools to monitor and alert the user of any motion it sees, and video is immediately stored off sight to the internet making it impossible for anyone to tamper with.

First, after the installation of the Mole IP Setup from the CD, the running program says that as a first step I should register my Mole camera. All my attempts to register it through this program failed. It says it can not find unregistered cameras. Anyway, I did the registration from astac.yoics.com. I also upgraded to the Yoics Pro.Second problem is that the camera behaves strangely after 2-3 minutes of operation. It start rotating probably in serach of wi-fi, then freezes with face turned back, and that's it. It is the same when connected through both LAN and wifi. The only way to revive it is reboot. After the reboot it works again 2-3 minutes and freezes again. It is really annoying.Third, and the most irritating problem - I plug it in, it starts working ok, wifi connected. I come to my office, open yoics, open my camera. It works ok. Then I log out, and that is it. I can no longer connect to my camera, unless I call home and ask someone to reboot it.

Got the camera visible from my computer, but even with him doing manual overrides from there, they couldn't get it to register (giving him the Mac address showed that someone else with an AOL email address had already registered the camera... how is this possible for a NIB product from Costco?  Bizarre repackaging perhaps?  Company selling used garbage that didn't work in the first place?  very suspicious).So, all told, a lot of time and energy trying to get this junk to work, but their own website and registration requirements crippled the thing.Meanwhile, once I got my computer registered with their \"yost\" system, guess what DID show up?  Not the MOLE camera I bought for a ton of money... but my own Logitech computer cam.  Weird... now why don't I have to \"register\" that and provide it's Mac address?  You morons are crippling your own product with this stuff!Returning to costco.

In addition to all the cofiguration issues that lot of people ha run to, the camera has several security and opeartional issues.1)The camera keeps making a clicking noise every once in a while2)As noted in previous comments, only the main page is authenticated3)if you decide to chat with their MCPs \"Microsoft Certified professional: this is by the way, one of the lowest certification in the technical field and MCPs are mainly hired as entry level techs\", they will ask you to click on a link then they will remote, access and take control of your computer, without your pre-approval or authorization, I found this really disturbing WTF, have these guys heard of PRIVACY before !!!!! Well, when I called to complain, KIM sounded like if he is from India, so that tells it all..4)The WIFI SSID and authentication information are transmitted in clear plain text5)SD card can't be managed from the camera, you can view/play the images/recording but you can't rename or delete them.6) The camera has a green led that stays on all the time. Denny, the customer support MCP, asked me to be creative and cover it with a black tape..WTF7)I always keep #7 for funny things; the camera will stop recording if any of this applies  a) You close your browser (regardles which one)  b) You browse from another system (good thing about it is that this \"feature\" doesn't descriminate..this will happen  regardless if you are a MAC, PC, Windows, Linux, Asian, Floridian or Red Sox fan)  c) if you use your smart phone (no descrimination in which brand you are using either :~) ) The only way for the camera to keep recording is to keep your browser open and not remote from any other computer or smartphoneA Dummy Camera will do a better jon than the ASTAK products, so DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA, and if you did TAKE IT BACK, COSTCO gives you 90 days to return electronics with a FULL refund..", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wireless connection keep failing", "Author": "Y. han \"njmk\"", "ReviewID": "R10VYL111R9DFB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one from costco.

After about two years, I decided to do that to my home network (Apple).But then the camera's network didn't work any more.  I clicked about a lot on ASTAK's screens and nothing happened. I followed the procedure on the setup screen, which I eventually found -- it requires you to find an old network cable from your junk-cable box, and use that.  Of course the first 2 cables I tried didn't work, so I was quite frustrated. (I think some of these cables, although they are alike on the outside aren't guaranteed to be the same as the cable needed here).  Be that as it may, I tried a third cable that worked and the setup proceeded after that. After giving my new password to the prompt in the stup, all was fine.NB:  To get my WiFi iMac, iPad, etc. to work, I didn't need a cable... All I needed was my new password :)MEMORY CARD and FRI CTIONWhile I'm at it and have the Mole Cam down from its perch, I'd like to swap out the SD card to put a higher capacity one into the camera.  Nowhere on the card slot is it specified what the maximum memory capacity is that this thing will take before puking.  WHY?  Why not?  Do the gentleman at ASTAK want me to go rummaging through my things ftom two years ago to find what its specs are?  The lettering on the back of the camera is, of course, printed in tiny letters, black on black.  Thank you, Astak!  Why designers and programmers and their managers insist on such causing FRICTION in the use of a product is beyond me!  Take a lesson from the likes of Apple and THINK before you kick your product over the fence to the sales department!SOUNDAnother irritating thing about this setup is that there is no VOLUME control.  Sure, I can use the computer's control to diminish the echo from the cam, but this s/b a native feature.FUTURE PURCHASEWhen I initially set this thing up I found many more frustrating things about the ASATK cam, but it's been two years now and I don't remember everything -- but I remember that!  :(.

You will pay a little more but you will get your money's worth. Trust me! If you pay about $75 more than this camera (about $270) you will get a quality camera from Panasonic. You can pay $1000 if you want and get a really amazing wireless camera that you can view on your mobile phone. Amazing.Astak. Huh! Time for a drink after this one.
