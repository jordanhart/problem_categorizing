{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Astonishing power in a super-compact design", "Author": "Edward Sawma", "ReviewID": "R1ASAWRR87U6JK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously had a Canon PowerShot S110 digital ELPH from 6 years ago or so, and loved that camera.  I didn't realize that there was so much more that a little camera could do!  I researched the new Canon's out there (since I loved the ELPH), and decided on the SD770 IS for its compact design and features outlined well by others.This camera just blows me away.  It takes amazing pictures in full-auto mode.  In situations where full-auto doesn't quite do the job as well as possible, this camera lets you change ISO settings, white balance, focus method, and tons of other factors.Compared to the S110, I thought the ability to change the ISO setting was a big improvement over previous generations.  You're actually changing the sensitivity of the sensor in the camera, allowing you to take pictures with more clarity in conditions that have less light.  This, coupled with the image stabilization (which again, blows me away on this camera), allows you to not have to use flash, preserve the real look of the scene, and take a crisply clear picture.Battery life is amazing.  I haven't charged it once yet... I'm going on over 150 pictures taken now.  I've taken many pictures in low light with no flash, which drains the battery faster because the sensors have to stay on longer.  The battery low warning has now come on... but I've still taken over 10 pictures on low battery, so it gives you a good amount of warning time.I also thought I didn't need more megapixels, because my pictures from my 2MP S110 looked great.  True, 10MP looks even better, but a HUGE benefit is that it automatically improves your ability to do digital zoom and keep the picture looking crisp.  You can take a 10MP full resolution photo of a scene, then crop it down later to the zoomed-in part of the scene that you want, and still have a crisp image for a 4x6 print.  The camera is also able to do this more automatically... if you choose to take a photo at a lower resolution, like 4MP, and you use digital zoom, the camera will automatically use its sensor to it's full 10MP capability to zoom digitally and retain image quality.Just a fantastic camera.  I'm glad I stuck with Canon, and I'm glad I bought the latest generation.", "Date": "August 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Trying to decide between a Canon SD1100, SD790 and this SD770?", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "RT8FTKDLO891T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're trying to decide between these 3 digital elph models SD1100, SD770 and SD790 which fall in a similar price range, here's my take. I have used the SD1100 and SD790 extensively and SD770 is like an in-between hybrid.{The SD790 is actually the 2008 upgrade of 2007s very popular model SD750. The SD1100 is an upgrade of the SD1000. Canon probably felt the need for an in-between model so the SD770 is new, with the layout and screen-size similar to SD1100 but the CCD is larger like the SD790 making it a 10MP camera.}Common new features:- Digic III processor = better picture taking- Face detection - detects multiple faces in a shot and adjusts the flash, white balance so that the faces don't get bleached out and you get less red eye- Motion detection - focuses on subject even if they're moving so your shot is not blurry.- Shooting modes - NEW sunset mode (great results) and the usual portrait, night shot, stitch assist (panoramic), foliage, fireworks, indoor, kids and pets, underwater, aquarium, beach, snow and ALSO Color accent (keep one color and rest of pic is B/W) and Color Swap (Exchange one color with another)Here are the pros and cons of each model:SD1100: Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)Pros: Small size with a nicely contoured look. Cool colors. Viewfinder with 2.5 inch screen. Lowest price.Cons: Less MPs (8MP) and smaller CCD 1/2.5 inch.SD770: (Priced in between SD1100 and SD790)Pros: Smallest in size. 10 MPs. Viewfinder with 2.5 inch screen. Larger CCD at 1/2.3 inch.Cons: Camera controls are not as intuitive and flexible as the SD790. Screen size is smaller than SD790.SD790: Canon PowerShot SD790IS 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomPros: Small camera. 10 MPs. Mega 3 inch screen which really makes composing shots so easy. Larger CCD at 1/2.3 inch. Layout is intuitive. Flat layout on the back with extra button for replay, makes switching between modes faster.Cons: Price is highest of the three models in consideration. No viewfinder, it hasn't been a problem for me even in bright sunlight but if you prefer to have a viewfinder it may be a deal breaker for you.All 3 cameras come with Image stabilization and the usual Canon features and shooting modes. All three cameras are small, the SD800s and SD900s are bigger in size.I prefer SD770 and SD790 over SD1100 due to the slightly improved picture taking.Just for performance and features my #1 Rank goes to SD790 due to it's larger screen and intuitive controls and great pics.  SD770 is a close second with a great balance between size and performance and SD1100 comes in 3rd. (Read comments section for more discussion between SD770 and SD790)Since price of these cameras fluctuates on Amazon everyday it's hard to rank them using prices but recently I have seen the SD790 go for $189 and SD770 go for $159 and the SD1100 for $149. At just a $10 difference between the SD770 and SD1100 I will recommend the SD770.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Comparing Canon PowerShot Digital ELPH cameras", "Author": "Julie Neal", "ReviewID": "R1DIV1015HTVSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a travel writer I spend a lot of time at Walt Disney World, and Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs are the most common cameras I see. Families seem to love them, because they're so easy to carry and operate. About the size of a deck of playing cards, each of these \"pocket cameras\" really do slip right into a pants pocket, and their rectangular designs make them easy to grip. Best of all, they all take good photos. (How do I know? Because I've actually gotten to use every one of these models. Nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs.)Here's my breakdown of the ten bestselling Digital Elph models. Any of the first six are superb choices:1ST PLACE: SD1100 ISAn update to the SD1000 (see below), this 2008 8MP beauty features image stabilization, a moderately long zoom (38-114 mm) and a small indent on the right side for a good grip. Plus it comes in colors! My daughter has a blue one and uses it every single day. During school days the image stabilization made a difference in her on-the-bus shots. Hers has gotten scratched up a bit, but the marks are small and hardly noticeable.2ND PLACE: SD870 ISThe ELPH to buy if you want a wide-angle lens. Slightly thicker than the SD1100 IS, this 8MP model doesn't have an optical viewfinder which makes it tough to use in bright sunlight, otherwise there's little not to love. My husband uses one as a comp camera, to compose shots for the travel guide \"The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World.\"3RD PLACE: SD770 IS (The camera on this page)Just released in May, this 10 MP model is, in a way, an update of the SD1100 IS (see above). I rate it lower because it costs about $50 more and doesn't come in colors. On the other hand, it has a longer battery life than the 1100 and features an improved LCD screen that is very easy to view. As for photo quality, I can't tell the difference.4TH PLACE: SD950 ISThere's a lot to like in this 12.1 MP camera. First off, it's gorgeous. The body, though a little thick, is titanium. An upgrade to the SD850 IS (see below), it has a 3.7x zoom lens and adds manual controls as well as the ability to stitch together panoramic images. The only reason I don't rate it higher is the price.5TH PLACE: SD890 ISWant a long zoom lens? Here's your baby, a 2008 10 MP model with a 5x zoom. Also has the new bright LCD screen and all the other 2008 Canon goodies. The most expensive Canon PowerShot ELPH.6TH PLACE: SD790 ISWith the same 10 MP image sensor and 3x zoom lens as the SD770 IS, this 2008 model stands out only for its larger 3-inch LCD display and, as a result, lack of optical viewfinder. The rear controls are different, too, with a flatter design that uses fewer buttons.7TH PLACE: SD1000In my opinion there's no reason to buy this 7.1 MP model. Released in 2007, it's been replaced by the SD1100 IS (see above). The SD1000 is a fine camera but it doesn't have image stabilization, a key feature of the 2008 lineup.8TH PLACE: SD850 ISThe ancestor to the SD890 IS, this 8 MP Elph combines a 4x zoom and 8 MP photo size with an image stabilizer. Every button, dial and switch has a quality feel. Slighter larger than the other models here, it is a little tougher to pop in and out of your pocket, but if you have larger hands it may be just what you are looking for.9TH PLACE: SD800 ISThis 7.1 MP predecessor to the 870 doesn't focus well at its edges when set at its widest angle. Unless it's priced really cheap, get the 870 instead.10TH PLACE: SD750The 2007 PowerShot flagship offers a light meter that adjusts for facial brightness, 17 shooting modes, some first-rate movie features and red-eye correction -- features that were innovative a year ago but are common in Canon's latest models. No image stabilization; no optical viewfinder. Choose a 2008 model instead.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Ultra-Compact", "Author": "settsu", "ReviewID": "R1DA9OHU9ED6CJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is an ideal everyday camera for photos and videos. The image stabilization, face recognition, and great performance (start-up and shot-to-shot times) were especially useful in real indoor and outdoor situations.The primary purpose for us purchasing this camera was so my stay-at-home wife could quickly and easily capture the \"firsts\" and other special moments of our almost 11 month old. It was a day-to-day replacement for a Pentax istDS digital SLR (great quality but impractical and SLOW autofocus on indoor/flash shots) and a few years old lowest-end miniDV JVC camcorder (a pain to capture/edit/archive.)The last semi-compact digital we purchased was a Canon A40. Really great camera. In 2002.Top Three SD770 Pros:- Size: There's hardly an excuse not to bring this anywhere you might want to take real photos and quick videos. It's barely thicker than a deck of cards and smaller than one of said cards. (See customer photos)- Overall Real-world Performance: Truly a joy to use. Even for someone like myself who has handled pro and \"pro-sumer\" photo and video equipment and has VERY high usability expectations.- Useful functions: Image stabilization is the best thing evar. Face recognition is better than I expected, especially for this type of camera. Macro works quite well.Top Three Cons:- Size: You could EASILY forget this in your pocket and wash it in the laundry. No joke.- Quality: By default, edges are soft and daytime indoor shots can be grainy (noise), since the auto ISO bumps up to keep the shutter speed fast enough to reduce motion blur. I intend to check settings to remedy this, if possible.- Useless functions: There's 3 or 4 SOUND themes alone (not including silent). Lots of bloated \"features\" and photo \"effects\" that are better forgotten after you play with it the first couple days. Seriously, forget them. If you dare post any online you will be mocked the world over. If there's a way to disable/hide them, someone tell me...Top Three Accessories: (buy these at the same time or very SOON after)- Memory card: Simply not optional. The camera includes a 32MB SD card which is roughly equivalent to including a free tank of gas with a new Porsche. \"Gee, thanks.\" We went for the Transcend 16GB SDHC Card with Compact Card Reader which fits over 3,500 photos at full-quality or over 2 hours of video, or some combination of both. It sounds like overkill, but we bought this camera to be the sole capturer of memories on week-long trips with our first child. I changed the resolution to 6MP at Superfine compression and the camera reports we can take photos through 2017.- Spare Battery: Somewhat optional. Like most modern ultra-compacts, the SD770 uses a proprietary battery pack so you won't be running down to the drugstore in a pinch. Just get it.- Camera bag/pouch: Not in the same class as a the previous two, but where are you going to keep the spare battery otherwise anyway? It does fit (snugly) in a playing card box, so there is that...To be sure, I am biased towards Canon, in that I have had nothing but good experiences with their products (scanners, printers, cameras). But considering the exhaustive research I do for most purchases over $10 and my high expectations, the Canon SD770IS does not disappoint.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Getting Better All The Time!", "Author": "Mark Scala", "ReviewID": "R2UNXPQIJ23WMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Canon SD770IS to replace a PowerShot A95. A couple years ago, I had purchased a Digital Elph for a family member and found myself using that much smaller and lighter camera, instead of my A95. Given advancements in technology, it was time to upgrade. The most important feature in looking for a replacement was small size and the use of a rechargeable battery. Pixel resolution was less a factor as the A95, with only 5 megapixels, produced sharp images. The most noticeable improvement, even over the previous Elph, was in the increased speed of all camera functions including boot up and image recording. Image quality is stellar and the color balance and metering is excellent. If you currently own a Canon digital camera and are upgrading, the basic navigation of features remains primarily the same, so that will be familiar to you. Access to the camera's shooting modes use menus rather than a physical dial as on the A95. The LCD screen is fairly large, well illuminated and easy to view, even in bright light. Ultimately, the most important consideration with digital photography should be image quality and ease of use. I have years of experience with manual SLR film cameras and point and shoots alike, and this model fits the bill perfectly for true \"turn it on and shoot\" photography. Images are crisp and clear with great detail and vibrant color. The light meter does a great job of assessing the scene and choosing the best possible combination of shutter speed and aperture. I highly recommend this camera for someone looking for an easy-to-use, lightweight, small and effective digital camera. A high capacity (SDHC) memory card will hold a ridiculous number of photos even at the highest resolution. Uploading photos to a PC or Mac is easy with either the supplied software or Apple's iPhoto software, which works seamlessly with the camera. I would recommend both a high capacity SD card and the optional leather case to protect the camera, especially if dropped.

The contrast with that camera made me appreciate the SD770 probably more than I normally would have. So this is a comparison.. Much sharper lens.. Images better looking at ISO 80-800, above that they are useless in both cameras.. Canon images noisier at higher ISOs because  of less aggressive noise reduction, but as a result they are crisper. Sony gives a mush wherever there is fine detail. You can simulate the Sony look by running the Canon images through a noise filtering program like Neat Image at a high filter setting.. Canon is 10MP vs Sony's 13.6MP, but all the above hold true even with the Canon images ressed up to 13.6MP.. Much smaller body, truly a shirt pocket camera, which is the primary reason for me for buying a P&S.;. Both have usable optical viewfinders. The centering accuracy of the SD770 seems to be even better than Canon G9.. Much faster operation. For all intents and purposes Canon turns on and off instantly, probably in a second or two. With the Sony I had to tap my fingers waiting for the camera to turn on to take a picture, or to turn off to put it in my pocket.. Very logical and quick user interface for all the main photographic functions, like exposure compensation, ISO setting, macro setting, etc. Clearly Canon knows what settings  the photographers would like to have quick access to even in a P&S.;.

It's fairly easy to use but some of the functions could be a little easier to access. It has one menu for general camera settings like pictures size, date, etc. and a separate menu for settings you might set while taking pictures. It can be a little annoying having to dive into these different menus to find what you what to change. My biggest complaint is the picture quality. The camera automatically jacks the ISO up to get the shutter speed up to limit blur but the result is very noisy and pixelated. Canon, if you are going to boost the ISO to limit blur, you should also use a sensor capable of capturing images at that ISO with little noise.Summary, get this camera if you want to get quick snapshots of family functions, etc. Skip it if you want to take pictures of anything in less than ideal light conditions.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Comparing Canon PowerShot Digital ELPH cameras", "Author": "Julie Neal", "ReviewID": "R1MLTGD65NRAL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a travel writer I spend a lot of time at Walt Disney World, and Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs are the most common cameras I see.

They've all been great which is why I've been loyal to the brand. I bought this one because my husband wanted our Elph PowerShot 1000 so it gave me the excuse to upgrade to 10MP. I love the size and feel of the 770, the LCD is crisp and clear and it's totally easy to use. It also has an optical viewfinder which is great in really bright light situations. The pictures are fantastic and the Image Stabilization feature, which the 1000 didn't have, is awesome for those shots where you don't want to use a flash in low light situations. I'm also extremely impressed with the video quality, I just used this to create a bunch of five minute movies of martial arts students for study and the video looks great at 640x480 and even blown up on the computer screen. Even the audio is also fine (and I'm a professional musician so I have picky ears). I also love the rechargeable battery feature.

It is an amazing little gem.1. I dont notice it in my pocket - it is that small. The power on button is recessed so I dont worry about it turning itself on inadvertently.2. All modes are very intuitively accessible using the five way keypad on the back.3. The picture quality is acceptable or better.4. I dont have anything to compare the image stabilization with. It sometimes worked okay with shots as long as 1/3 seconds, but at other times I got hazy shots at 1/8s exposures - both at the same aperture. I think that has more to do with the steadiness of my hand.5. The various delays associated with a point and shoot digital are hugely reduced compared to the other P&S; digitals I have tried. The only appreciable delay is when the flash recycles.6. The battery life is great. I shot 250 frames, all with the display on, reviewed pictures again and again during the day, and it didnt complain. It also takes only about an hour to charge.7. The body is plastic, and scratches easily. The display and the front plastic around the lens in my camera is all scratched up after a 3 day trip.Overall - I find it much better to have a small camera with me all the time than to miss shots because my bulky versatile camera is sitting at home.

Getting a new PowerShot was a no-brainer, and it is great to see how they have improved.The SD 770-IS has everything I loved about my old PowerShot, but with a clearer picture, longer battery life and a host of new features it will take me quite a while to work my way through.  The image stabilizer and face detection are just amazing, and my pictures look even better than before.  I am anxious to try out the other modes as well, such as for shooting pictures of fireworks, continuous motion, vegetation and pretty much everything else you can think of. I am by no means a professional photographer, so I appreciate the technology giving me that extra boost!The size and shape are also an improvement over my previous PowerShot.  It is the perfect travel companion, about as big as a deck of cards, and slips easily into my pocket.  The ease of use is really nice for when you have to ask a stranger to snap a quick shot.  Just a half-click to focus, and then a full press to take the photograph.As a cool accessory, I recommend the Canon WP-DC23 Waterproof Case.

It's super-quick to turn on and sift through manual options, it takes outstanding pictures if you know how to use the manual mode with the correct ISO, and it fits right into your pocket so easily. It's practically perfect in all but four ways I can think of that shouldn't prevent anyone from buying this as their go-to digital camera for personal use:1. The most frustrating thing is the delay between clicking to shoot and the camera taking the shot. It's a split-second delay, but a delay nonetheless, and something I'm not used to. You push it half-way to focus, and then when you push it all the way down, it should instantly take the picture! Foolishly enough, there's still a slight delay before it takes the picture, leaving you without control of when exactly it captures. Poor design choice on Canon's part.2. Auto mode usually ends up taking slightly blurry pictures in low light and even in medium light. The Auto settings don't get you what you want - I've often found that it Auto adjusts to one ISO too little, which is too bad. But, if you know how to use ISO in Manual mode, you're good to go. Wish I could rely on Auto though.3. Many features require reading the manual to access/know they're there. Not a bad thing of course since maybe one would say you should read the manual anyway, but I only discovered long exposure and and ISO3200 for instance by reading the manual.4. I'm used to my old Pentax camera that used Lithium Ion AA batteries, so although you can take 340 photos/video before this Canon runs out of batteries, I'm used to more. I wish they had a higher capacity battery to buy, but compared to other cameras that use proprietary batteries, this one lasts by far the longest for its class.I'd definitely buy from this camera line again.

Which is what we were looking for. Something easy to take whenever, wherever in a pocket, a purse, etc.Another quality feature is that it includes a rechargable battery AND the charger.

The battery also sips energy just adding to the verstility of the camera as a great choice for the I always want to have a good small camera available to me.Overall I am very happy with picture quality and performance. The camera takes quick pictures so you are able to, more often than not, get the shoot you were intending to get. The colors are very rich outdoor with high color saturation.Indoors I have had good but not great results. The flash range is also very limited. Also video quality is not as good as I hoped for. The software is another big plus though. No frills but solid software that transfers quickly with no problems.Plenty of shooting modes and easy to use menus to get to them, including manual options if you are so inclined. You also have different focusing modes and a super high ISO if you want it. I am use to cameras with much larger optical zooms. But I understood I had to give something up to get such an ultra compact camera.Would I recommend this as your only digital camera, yes if you were ok with 3x optical zoom and medicore video.

It's 2.5\" but very clear, bright, and easy to see even in bright light.  Compared to cameras that came out just a year or so earlier, there is a noticeable improvement.  The face recognition feature works well, though as you might imagine it doesn't get it right 100% of the time.One feature that had no noticeable effect was an in-camera red eye elimination tool that is supposed to keep it from happening when you snap the photo.

The ONLY reason why anyone would do that is lack of experience with electronics. While feature wise both SD770 and SD1100 are similar - there are HUGE differences in various aspects of the cameras. Yes, their primary function is to take good pictures and they both do a great job - but in that line of thinking, a Dodge Neon would always be a better choice than a BMW 3 series because the Neon does the same thing (takes you some place) cheaper.Let me get to the differences that the other \"knowledgeable\" reviewer missed:1. SD 770 IS features ISO 3200, SD1100 doesn't2. SD 770 IS is actually smaller than SD 1100Now the biggest difference: SD 770 is MADE IN JAPAN, while the SD 1100 is Made in China. You ask what difference does it make? It makes a world of difference. The build quality of the SD 770 is CRAZY and INSANE. Everything is precision made - the gaps and the seams are STRAIGHT and EVEN, even the label at the bottom is precisely places with even gaps around it. Why does it matter? In a device with such sophisticated movements, precision is the KEY to reliability.You just can't say the same about the SD1100. It looks like a typical made in China item - seams are uneven, battery door may not be flush with the body. It looks to be more like a off-brand, like Polaroid or V-Tech item than a Canon. JUNK in terms of build quality.The concept of \"Where it's made\" is almost non-existing in America when if comes to buying things. There are some people who would buy \"Made in USA\" but that is just solely for patriotic reason - NOTHING to do with quality. On the other hand, worldwide, the phrase \"Made in JAPAN\" is just another way of saying \"extremely high-quality\". In Asia or Europe... basically anywhere but USA,  people would actually pay more for an item just because it is made in Japan, specially electronics. As a matter of fact, I have seen many Sony/ Panasonic or other Japanese brands put it as a \"feature\" the fact that a product is Made in Japan, right on the box. You don't have to go to far to see it - take a look at this item here Zojirushi NP-HBC18 10-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer with Induction Heating System, Stainless Steel - it is without dispute the best rice cooker money can buy and it says right on the control panel \"Made in Japan\", not only in the product label underneath.You love electronics, you admire technology - now prepare to be shocked to see how precise manufacturing really can be - with the SD770 IS, not with the SD1100 IS.

The optical image stabilization is very useful in a camera this small since the pressing of the shutter can cause blurry images due to camera shake.The image is a bit soft on the edges when viewed at 100 percent on your computer screen, but this is expected and much better quality than most in this category.Barely larger than a deck of cards, there is no excuse for not having a camera on you when a photographic opportunity presents itself.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Pocket Shooter", "Author": "Michael Berkowitz", "ReviewID": "R1D763DOBILUEU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera before a trip to Israel.

I paid twice this amount for the now broken one.I am very pleased with my purchase minus a few minor concerns (reason for the 4 stars - the camera isn't perfect). This one looks sleek. It is small and compact. You can definitely hide it away in a small purse or shirt pocket.The clarity of the pictures is a huge step up from the other camera I had, which was only a year old. My testing (based on experience with older camera) - taking pictures on my patio at night of things on or around my patio. The flash is perfect and I could see things in my patio furniture I never noticed before. I took pictures in well lit areas of my home and dimmed areas. The camera does an excellent job adjusting to each environment and the lighting.The video capabilities are way better than my other camera too. My other camera made videos look grainy or blurry depending on what was being recorded. These are pretty clear.My only concerns are there a few plastic pieces on the camera - the battery/SD chamber and the A/V door. I realize for the price I shouldn't complain I am just worried that these may break easier, but I have made myself promise to be more careful with this one.The other issue I have is the zoom. I have yet to find a camera that will allow you to really zoom in and get the clarity you are looking for. I am sure part of it has to do with adjusting settings on the camera but I would like to have a point and shoot that is truly a point & shoot where I don't have to modify settings to zoom in and capture a close-up.Overall this camera is everything I was looking for.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Canon SD770IS is a great all-purpose camera - tons of features in a tiny package", "Author": "Anthony F.", "ReviewID": "R3EP7C4WAL48LO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I bought the SD770IS I owned a Canon PowerShot A560.  I liked the image quality and the virant colors, but I quickly became very frustrated with the bulkiness, the horrendous battery consumption, and the lack of image stabilization.  I wanted to get a replacement camera before a planned trip to France.  After a day of online research I decided on the SD770IS, and this turned out to be one of my best electronic purchases in years.The colors and picture quality are outstanding (the 10 MP really pays off).  The battery pack lasts and lasts.  Shooting videos or pictures in conditions which work the image stablization (like low light) burn through the battery the quickest, but the battery should still last you all day.  On my trip I shot about 1,500 pics and about 2.5 GB of video and the quickest I burned through a battery was a day and a half.The image stablization was one of my main motivations to get a new camera and this doesn't disappoint.  I was able to get very nice pictures in catacombs, in dimly lit museums where flashes were not allowed, and by candlelight.  Considering that almost all of these were hand held shots (no tripod) I'm astounded how well they came out.The camera's about the size of a deck of cards so it slips into a pocket without any problem.  It's a joy to take it along and know that you have all the camera you want and not feel like you're lugging around a brick.  The only knock I have against the camera is that it only has a 3x optical zoom, but I'll trade that for the rest of the features.  Besides, the fact that you're shooting with 10 MP makes your digital zoom shots pretty decent.Now, I'm no professional photographer, I'm about as amateur as they come.  So if you really know how to take pictures and you're looking for the kind of quality you can get with a $5,000 camera, this one isn't for you.  But if you're looking for very good quality at a reasonable price*, great battery life and image stabilization, tons of features, all in a tiny light weight package, I can't recommend the SD770IS highly enough.* In the interests of full disclosure I happened to luck out and find this camera on sale for $150.

I was able to compare its function and results with that as well as my daughter's Sony 8mp Cybershot.Although physically this is a much different camera in terms of size, functionally it is similar to the 590 with minor differences. With the 590 there is a setting for both \"night shot\" & \"night scene\" where there is no \"night scene\" setting on the 770. However, pictures shot at night with the 770 fared as well if not better than the 590 as long as the camera was steady.The extra two megapixels seem to really make a difference in terms of color and clarity. I am not a professional photographer, but I'm not a rank amateur either. Compared to the Sony, these pictures jump out at you. The color in the Sony appears washed out when placed next to the Canon. We had two separate family events where several pictures of the same scene were shot with each camera so we could actually compare the pictures on the computer side by side. The difference is stunning. For the person who isn't interested in all the technical data, the bottom line is....the Canon 770is 10mp camera takes excellent pictures with excellent color and clarity. It is compact and easy to manage except perhaps for those who have sausages for fingers (you know who you are).

The camera is much bigger than the SD500 that I upgraded from--even though it's got so many bells and whistles.  One thing about Canon that's got my eyebrow raised:  Why the big font as if we can't read?The Image Stabilization is a wonderful thing, right along with the face detection.  It even focused on an enlarged print of a little girl!  The 3.7 zoom is nothing to frown at either.  ISO is easier to set now so one can play around with the settings...The camera is made for \"big hands\" and it took me about two weeks of off and on shooting to get used to it.  The 12MP quality is okay, and I didn't have to get used to too much new button placement.  One thing I didn't like is the play button.  I felt I had to really push my finger on the play button in order to view my photos.  It annoyed me enough to see what else was out there.The Canons SD770 and SD790 were next on my list.  Even though they were \"only\" 10MP, they had newer technology from Canon:  Motion Detection and Infinity and cute buttons in all new small packages.SD770IS(Silver)First the SD770.  This was a nice small camera!  Not cheap feeling at all, Canon packed everything but the kitchen sink in there.  I like the \"Infinity\" setting that the SD950 didn't have.  Also, I have the silver version and it's nice, small, sleek, and takes great pictures.  I didn't like the way the battery cover was not spring loaded.  Also, either it was this particular camera or the 770 in general, but it seemed like I had to \"dig\" for the battery and SDHC card once put in.  Yes, it's compact, hefty, and full of bells and whistles, but it was...kinda boring.  Maybe because the silver color didn't have the pizazz of the black version that I'd read reviews on.  Moving on to the SD790...SD790ISBigger camera!  Compared to the 770, it's a giant!  The same size as the 950 except in a square/cube like form.  The 950 is curvy, while the 790 is sleek and boxy (not sure if that's an oxymoron or not!).  The 790 also has a new button format that I'm not sure if I like or not.  I really enjoyed the SD500's button placement and while I can appreciate a \"play\" button...why not make it easy access instead of having to constantly press the button down?  I'm thinking that the play buttons will eventually wear out.  The big screen is nice, and even though I haven't used a viewfinder since...ever, it would be nice to \"just have\".  So the lack of a viewfinder is a potential bummer.  You never know when you gotta smear your nose on the photo screen to take pic!  lol  Also, the 790 is a fingerprint magnet.I tried to take the same pictures with all the cameras, but couldn't always (morning/evening, different zoom, etc.).  Both the 770 and 790 have high ISO settings (as did the 950), but I didn't even use anything that high previously!  All the pictures came out great.  Even my crappy pictures of my messy coffee table were clear and colorful!  One issue I had with all three cameras was the color accent setting.  It seemed as if I got better black and white/one color photos from my SD500 than either of these cameras.  I have to do a lot more tweaking.  However, it could be just because of the balances of the colors and the lighting effects in my environment.If I just had to choose based on portability, photos, looks, bells/whistles, ease of use, I would go crazy trying to decide, but finally take the Canon SD770 because it's smaller.  The thing that keeps me wondering about the 770 is, \"how can they fit all these specs in this TINY camera!??  But, I'm a sucker for good looks, so the scale points back to the 790!  True it's bigger, but it's still small considering the screen.  I always take great care of my electronics, so I'm not so worried about fingerprints.  If the button issue upsets me extremely, then I'll just upgrade to Canon's latest and greatest in 6-8 months.Either way, can't wait to take pics on the new SD790.

I have had every iteration of the Elph line and this camera was an upgrade from the original SD IS, the SD700 IS. While the SD700 is only 6MP it takes great pictures. I have used the SD700 on trips to Italy and London (rather than lug the Canon 20D around) and the image quality is superb. The camera build quality is excellent and solid. I found the SD770IS camera build to be flimsy in comparison. Also, I do not like the slide bar selector at all. I prefer the dial to select camera, view image or record options. As far as picture quality, my SD700IS takes a much better picture. The SD770IS is a much smaller camera than the SD700IS (feels about half the size) but the Elph line is small anyway. I would rather carry a few extra ounces around and have a better built camera. I am returning this and ordering the SD990IS which looks like it may have the same build quality as my SD700IS.

Otherwise, SD 770 and SD790 are the same with respect to functionality and performance. SD 750 and SD 1100 do not have Image stabilization, So I did not opt for those either. This camera is sleek and is compact and is very easy to carry around and take pics instantly. Image stabilization is excellent. The user interface is very user friendly and an amateur can operate it easily. It has various features like color accent which takes cool pictures. Macro mode takes amazing pics of rain drops, flowers etc. The zoom is good enough and the pictures are crisp even in night after 3x zoom. I would definitely recommend this canon product.

Too bad you can't change the star rating 'cause I'd drop this to 0 stars.6 coworkers own digital elph cameras and highly recommend them so when my trusty Fuji F700 started to misbehave I decided to give this a go.  I've owned and used this camera for five months now and have taken over 1500 pictures with it.Construction:It looks and feels solid.  Metal all around.  Look and feel are deceiving.  While there are no visible dents or scratches on the outside of the camera (I do not recall having dropped it and I carry it in a Canon hard case) the front and back appear to be separating from the frame.  When turning it on and between shots it will often pop (!) as if internal elements were not properly aligned.  2 stars.Features:It takes pictures and movies.  You can zoom while taking a movie.  You can force the flash to off.  It has auto face recognition and red eye erasing (the latter doesn't work well at all).  It has modes you can set through menus.  The time from when you push the on button to when you see something in the LCD is very short.  It's missing being able to force the flash to on and being able to rapidly take several photos in a row.  The time between normal shots is nearly as long as it takes the camera to start.  2 stars.Image quality:As I wrote above, it's better than a throw-away, but it's certainly not good.  The digital zoom (after the 3x optical zoom) is VERY BAD and gives grainy results regardless of the magnification chosen.  For as much as I spend on this ($240 through Amazon) I expected a good camera.  My F700 didn't cost this much and takes pictures that are orders of magnitude better.  How so?  That is the important thing, isn't it?  OK, it's no good at action shots.  I lock the focus on a solid object that's the distance that the moving object will be.  When the moving object comes along I take the shot.  It takes the camera so long to take a picture that I'm lucky if even a slow moving object is still in the frame by the time the shot actually takes.  It takes bad portraits.  The extra half second it takes to take a shot means that I've lost whatever expression I was looking for.  Movies are not fantastic but come out mostly OK - other than banding and terrible reactions to changing light conditions and sunlight.  I can get decent enough still life shots of subjects that are 3 to 10 feet away as long as light conditions are good (no flash needed).  0 stars.  (Edit down to 0.)Daily use:I bought an extra battery with it.  Well, golly, that wasn't necessary.  I can take more than 100 pictures with it on a full charge.  The lack of features (easy ways to force flash, rafale shooting) contributes to the difficulty of getting good shots.  Time between shots is way too high.  2 stars.Conclusion:It seems fine for a camera that you're not going to care about - to have in your pocket for those moments when you just want a camera.  [Long edit added:  Of course, it only seems that way.  You'll think you've taken decent pictures with it but they are, again, pure and utter crap.  I'm on a job in Australia...  I see amazing things every day.  There isn't even a setting on this piece of garbage to get it to take a decent picture.  Oh, you can get it to take OK pictures of people - but you have to put it in people mode.  What's the point of having a point and shoot camera if you have to program it to get it to do what you want?  Regardless, there isn't any setting for making a forest, landscape, bridge, cityscape, whatever, look nice.  Horrible, horrible, horrible piece of crap.]  You'll have to bear in mind that for those moments the pictures are unlikely to be as good as the moments - but you'll have your memories and they must think that's enough.  This is my third and surely last Canon camera.  -5 stars.Edit:Wow.  I'm stunned at how little people care about the quality of the shot.  This camera is GARBAGE and isn't worth half of what they're charging for it.Edit edit:I'm so angry...  I can't even believe the horrible pictures it took when I was in Sydney!

Well, let me tell you this is a great camera. Overall, pictures are crisp and sharp, colors are true to life and bright and features are adequate. I have had this for a year after getting during last year's Black Friday sale and have never regretted getting it (especially at a discounted price!)I like that it takes videos with sound, at a resolution more than adequate for YouTube sharing. The response time is pretty decent; you don't need to wait a long time for it to \"load\" or \"reset\" in between pictures. It's pretty fast. It also has face recognition, although I'm not sure how useful it really is. This pretty much have the features you'd come to expect from Canon pocket cameras.However, it's not perfect and there are drawbacks. When the flash is turned off, images can get a little blurry. The flash seems to force to camera to focus and when I turn it off (say, I don't want glare reflecting) I have to hold the camera real still or it'll get somewhat fuzzy. If there is natural light and the camera's autoflash doesn't go off, it's not a problem -- only when manually turned off. That's the biggest deficiency. This won't do well in low light settings where you want to capture something far away (try shooting someone at night with the Eiffel Tower lit up behind him) -- but this is a pocket point-and-shoot. In this price range, no camera will excel in low-light situations. (I did get the Eiffel Tower shot, but it was slightly blurry due to the aforementioned issue of blurriness with the flash off). This is mainly a limitation of the price range, not this model.I bought and tried at least four other cameras during Black Friday before picking this one. It was the best, by far.

It has exceeded my expectations. I needed to make a sketch of a building from a picture I had taken with this camera, so I made a 11\"x14\" print to sketch from. The print turned out beautifully: the exposure was right-on, the colors were good and all the fine details were there - even the letters in the street and building signs were clear and sharp. And there was no visible grain in the print.In addition to producing sharp pictures, I was also pleased to discover that it comes with a high capacity battery  - 300+ images per charge. I wanted a camera with a view finder to use when the day light is so bright it's hard to see the images in the LCD screen. Although this camera has a very good, bright LCD screen, I've found occasionally that it is necessary to use the view finder on bright days. Another thing I like about this camera is that I can carry it with me, at all times, either in my picket, or on my belt in the case that was designed for it. The lens is fairly fast (2.8) at wide angle setting, a desirable feature, since it helps with low light exposures. I have not had any problem with shutter lag. Maybe what pleases me the most is that I was able to buy it at a great price!Any complaints? It would be nice to have a lens with a little more telephoto length, but if the trade-off is either the faster lens (f2.8), or more telephoto length (150mm), I'd opt for the faster lens.  I found the printed manual to be difficult to use. Many of the camera's features are not covered in the index in the back of the manual. I found it was hard to track down information.

The L1 was, well, not so great - the software that came with the camera sucked, there was significant shutter lag, the camera seemed to take forever between pictures, and it began to fall apart all too soon after we bought it.The PowerShot is a refreshing upgrade.  Although the Nikon is fairly small, the Powershot easily fits in the palm of any adult's hand.  Indeed, one potential criticism is that the camera may be too small for some people with large hands to use effectively; however, it works fine for both my wife and me.The zoom lens on the Powershot is arguably a step back from our old Nikon since it only goes to 3X optical zoom rather than 5X.  That being said, it comes with some good image stabilization, motion detector, and other features our old camera lacks.  And as far as picture quality, there's no comparison - the Powershot is better.Serious photographers should undoubtedly spring for more elaborate camera.

I doubt I'll ever use the viewfinder on this camera, so I would have preferred the 3\" LCD. The controls do look slightly clumsier to me, though.This is a great camera. It's about the size of a pack of cards, and ways about the same (actually, it's a bit smaller and lighter now that I compare them in each hand). Definitely a quality build, although the card/battery door is flimsy. Auto mode works really well, and the image stabilization gets crisp shots even if I shoot one-handed (the controls are also workable with one-hand if you're not doing a lot of shot to shot adjusting, which is nice). I charged the battery when I got it, took about 2 hours... I've shot around 100 pics with flash and I've still got a full battery.It resolves detail pretty well, and even without flash indoors I can get crisp shots after a few tries. I'd get a tripod if you actually intend to do a lot low-light shooting, IS isn't enough. You won't even see camera shake in good lighting, though, which is much more important to me.The flash works pretty well, I was surprised.. I'll upload a pic of it if I can. The exposure on the faces works really well. Read the manual and set things up, and you'll love it.The camera focuses at about a 9 inches normally, and as close as an inch at the wide-end in macro mode.Color accenting/other image editing options all work well. I'm a graphic designer, so I wasn't that interested, but it's kind of fun to be able to instantly take stylized photos. Also, you can set it up to save both the edited and original picture, which is great. These aren't nearly as powerful as actual editing software, of course, but they work pretty well. You can set the tolerance level to a limited extent, so that you can choose one color, or colors near it, and keep expanding. In most of the shots I took, these options were sufficient for the desired effect.Panorama Stitching seems to work really well, I like it. Again, being a designer, I don't have a lot of use for it.Caveats:--LCD is a little small. I'd prefer the later model's design--no viewfinder and a larger LCD. Still, it's bright and easy to see.--Lens could've gone a little wider.. I think the later model corrected this as well.--Camera's should come with LCD protector. It's not like they're expensive, and I'm afraid to leave with this in my pocket without one. (EDit: I got minor scratches before putting the protector on, they're not noticeable, but it's a pain. The protector I got was just a cheap screen thing from Walmart. If they have one for the SD770, I recommend getting an EXiM SPUC protector from Ebay. I have one for my D40 which works beautifully, and was obviously custom made for the model.)--No cord for the battery adapter. They apparently changed the model, and it now must plug directly into an outlet.. and it's very wide. A slight pain if you use a surge protector, as it takes at least 2 plugs no matter how I put it on there (rather than setting the plug on one side, it's dead center).--No raw option.. or at least I can't find it. Not really sure why it wasn't included. Not a big deal, since the jpeg's don't seem to compressed and still look stunning, but since I do design I typically prefer using the highest fidelity input source possible. If it's there and I'm just overlooking it, someone help me out :-)Overall, this is a great, VERY lightweight, low-profile camera. I keep it on me all the time. It turns on fast--I can get the camera on, auto-calibrated, and a good shot in about three seconds. The shutter-lag is beyond my perception--meaning when I shoot I get exactly what I meant to. It's a problem shooting with flash though, because the orange light is really annoying, and people will turn to look at it. Real photographers will have an SLR for that, but it's a pain for me.

It came down to this camera, the SD880, and SD1100.  At the end of the day, this was priced the same as the SD1100 with more features, and was almost $100 less than the SD880.  Given how quickly these cameras change and improve, I figured ~$150 was totally worth it.  SD Memory cards have also come down in price, so I splurged ($30 :) ) for a 16GB SD card.I did a lot of research prior to selecting this camera, and suggest that you are VIGILANT before selecting a Canon PowerShot.  PowerShot these days refers to a huge # of different cameras that have different body styles (and a huge variation in size of their casings) and varying capabilities.We chose this camera for1)  compact size2)  relatively few negative reviews, suggesting durability was not a big issue.3)  positive experience with the SD500, which was a similar size4)  Digital zoom for situations where you can't get as close as you'd like5)  Price - it was only $159 (I don't know what is going on these days - several of the sites are selling it for $335! - way too much!)We took over 1000 pictures (!) on a trip to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic and the card and camera were still going strong.  The pictures turned out beautifully, and the camera was a breeze to use.  Quick shutter speed (you could click off 10 shots rapid fire in daylight, and response time was pretty good even in lower light.  The video setting takes surprisingly good video, too.All in all, a great find.UPDATE JULY 2009:Here are some additional details on positives/negatives with this camera:Key positives are:1)  Great picture quality...  Several thousand pictures in, we have been more than satisfied.  10MP's seems to give you more flexibility when zooming and in lower light.  We have these pictures turn out very well.2)  3x Optical Zoom and Digital Zoom - the digital zoom has worked very well for us in situations where we cannot get as close as we would like.3)  Good battery life (with the Canon OEM battery)4)  Good video - that has been an added bonus.  We take almost all our video with this camera and almost never carry our digital camcorder these days.5)  HUGE picture capacity.  The Kingston 16 GB SDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card is great and I have never come close to filling it (despite 1000+ pictures on the camera at certain times).  I guess I can't give the camera full credit for this one.Negatives1)  Can't turn the flash on manually - there is a flash toggle button that goes between \"flash off\" and \"auto flash\".  When I toggle to auto flash, there are still times the flash does not go off (might be user error, but this is annoying.  The SD500 had a \"flash on\" setting.  Doesn't seem like a confusing thing to provide2)  Sometimes slow in lower light - in some cases where you are trying to get that \"perfect shot\", the camera's setup time to take the shot is a bit annoying.  I find you have to press the shutter switch halfway down to get it to get in focus, and wait in that mode or you will miss a shot.  Somehow, it seems slower to me than our old SD500 now (when I initially posted, I had taken mostly daylight shots and hadn't seen this problem.)All in all, love the camera, have gotten great use out of it, and would buy another Canon.One more thing - strongly recommend the following Case Logic Semi-Hard case to protect it:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VVZ09O/ref=oss_T3_productthe case fits in a pocket easily and is very compact.", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon SD770IS", "Author": "I.

With herself not ever owning a camera or being that big into electronics, this goes above and beyond all her needs.Accompanied with an 8GB SD card, that can store 30min of video, with thousands upon thousands of images, at highest resolution--she was very excited.The camera turns on in about .5 seconds, I am not kidding.  It is extremely fast to turn on.  But the bad, it takes about 3-4 seconds from FULLY pushing down the button to:  Shine red light, focus, then finally take the picture.  3-4 seconds to do all that.  So if you want to take a picture and it's in your pocket, you've got about 4 seconds of waiting, that is, if you are quick.So a way around this, is to half-way hold down the button (which focuses the camera in 3 seconds), then pushing it another half-way takes the picture instantly, virtually just as fast as a camera with film.Its got lots of fun features...  We've had fun with the 'color accent.'  For example, at christmas, we went up to a tomato, pointed the camera at it, put the tomato inside the little rectangle on the screen, then push the left arrow (grabs the color).  After you have the color you want, take a picture!  The photo is a black & white shot, with the tomato the only thing in the picture with color!  Actually looks really cool.  That was a 'oooo' & 'ahhh'er.One gripe that high end users will see, is that low light, high ISO photos are not great.  Good at best.  Not only are the photos grainy & noisy, but the screen shows HIGH levels of noise too!  However, turn on the flash, and that fixes the problem, but the issue remains: high ISO images are highly saturated with noise.  Good thing most users will not notice this.My last camera was a LUMIX, which was a great camera, but I think I coughed up around $500 for that.

Following just 10 months of normal usage, it no longer takes still shots (but works on video) and intermittently fails to turn on.  Canon's 1-yr warranty was still in effect -- we were grateful at first -- but this proved to be a false hope.  After an initial notice of \"this will be promptly repaired for you,\" a few days later Canon's customer (dis)service CONVENIENTLY found corrosion damage from water(?!), which we dispute completely, and declined to repair it.  Either this camera is susceptible to condensation from sitting in a dry pocket or Canon is dishing out horse manure while slithering off the hook -- we suspect the latter.Couple the poor reliability of this camera with disingenuous warranty service, and suddenly Canon has lost us as a faithful customer.

It has a lot of cool options for you to take a good picture (not professional but it's still good.) Just play with this camera and I know a lot of thing comes with it like how to take a picture of an object that close to the lens but it's still clear in the picture (simply choose the flower symbol which is macro), I'm saying this because I know a lot of people might not even know like my friends on Facebook trying to take a close up pictures and they're all blurry. That is one of the trick I learned by playing with my camera or just read the manual, it helps. The picture quality is pretty good especially out in the sun (it's probably because of the light). I hate it when the flash is always auto so sometimes I have to turn it off when I don't need flash. The color is pretty accurate to what objects you're taking; it might change because of the light and angle of where you're taking a picture. I also hate it how it doesn't tell you exactly when you need to charge the battery...like this one time I turned it on and the battery symbol looks full but 5 mins later, it warned me that it's out of battery.

I have had the SD770is for almost three years now, and have no plans to \"upgrade\" any time soon. This little cam has every feature I could possibly want, the wonderful ELPH lens, and is the perfect size/shape for me. The only thing that makes the newer cameras better is the \"megapizels\", but who really needs more than 10 megapixels? To be honest, you don't really need more than 6 unless you're planning on blowing your pics up to poster size.  I love that the body is all metal, because it makes the camera sturdier (I've dropped this camera more than once, and it has not even a ding on it). I've taken the cam to three countries, and taken lots of pics with it, and I love it.If you're a professional photographer, you probably will never be satisfied with a point-and-shoot, no matter how good it is. But if you're like me, a tech-geek who wants to get great, frame-quality snapshots as easily as possible, then this is the camera for you. The image stabilization on this little beauty is priceless when you're on a tour bus trying to get a shot of something outside.Just for reference, I have a 2gb memory card in it right now, empty, and there is room for 463 pictures (on the top quality, top resolution setting) or 16 hours of video.

The video features are for standard sized videos.  Perhaps the one problem with the camera is its performance in low light. Images often appear with large amounts of grain, even at iso set at 80.  This might be more of a problem with it being a P&S; camera with a small sensor.  The 3x optical zoom works fairly well but one should avoid using the digital zoom which leaves a great deal to be desired.The camera itself is easy to carry and handle.  The camera has a fast start up and fairly quick shooting mechanism in daylight.  Some of the best shots have come from up close macro shots using the 3x zoom.  Landscapes are nice done with proper lighting or lack of. During full daylight some landscape shots would come out white washed or with too much light.Overall a great camera to use all around.

Let me start off by saying that I have a Nikon SLR but I wanted something small that I could carry in my purse just about every where but yet I didn't want to spend $200 or more.  I narrowed it down to two canons mainly becuase they still had an optical viewfinder and the nikons did not. I decided on this camera based on the price and the recharable battery. The other canon I was looking at was slightly cheaper, had 1x more optical zoom, but it used AA's and I hate AA's for camreas and it was not an Elph model.  When I bought this camera, Amazon had a much better price than the one I see now. If it had been the price I see now, I would not have bought it and would have suffered with the AA batteries on the other camera.Now that I have had a little time to play with this camera I can tell you that I love it! Its small, sleek, easy to use and takes great pictures! Since I have a toddler the setting I use the most is kids and pets and it takes great pictures of my little girl in motion! The prints have all come out nice and crisp and clear. I know I made a great choice and got quite a bit of bang for my buck! The camera fits great in my purse and I've even slipped it into my pocket a few times. I've only taken one video with it but I was very impressed by the sound quality of the video! My memory card is only a 1GB so plan on buying a larger one so I can take advantage of the video function more often!Never having owned a canon before I wasn't sure how easy it would be to figure out the settings. But just a few minutes with the instruction manual and I had most things down! I'm sure I'll go back to the manual for a few of the more advanced options but overall this camera is very user friendly.My only complaint is that I wish it did have more optical zoom. The olympus cameras seem to have a 5x and even the a series by canon that I was looking at had a 4x. The 3x on this one will do, but more would be nice.I highly recommend this camera if you can get a good price on it like I did. I would not pay over $200 for it however.

Once in a while I find myself wanting a bit more zoom.Overall I highly recommend.  Also, I'm not sure why the black camera is around $60 cheaper than the all silver one.  The black camera looks a lot cooler than the all siver one IMO.

After reading a lot of reviews, I decided on the 770 and so far have been very happy with the performance. The menus are very similar to what I was used to, with several improvements where they were needed. The color options, including \"vibrant\" produced great photos on my recent trip to Ireland.I'm a big fan of the new tool that finds and prevents faces from getting too blown out with the flash. My only complaint, however, is that when shooting (people or landscapes) the camera has a hard time balancing the lighting between the ground and sky. In Ireland, I'd either great beautiful green grass with a white, blown out sky, or dark foreground with the intense blue sky.

Our old camera was great at first but quickly became only adequate when our baby became a toddler. The Canon PowerShot really does track movement and capture great photos, especially for those of us amateur photographers trying to capture running toddler photos.The screen on the back is nicely sized, and the menus and controls are extremely intuitive. I was able to use the camera several times before picking up the super-thick manual to learn about other great features I wasn't using. The only caveat is that the charger is the kind that sticks directly to the outlet instead of having a cord, so it takes up wall space instead of fitting in my charging station.All in all, a fantastic buy.

If you are like me you want some value for your money...well this is it!  I researched several cameras on various sites, read all the reviews & even went to a few stores to see the actual cameras.  The Canon Powershot SD770IS is the one I ended up buying.  I love it!  I have no regrets buying it.  It's very easy to use & the directions are not at all hard to follow.  It's a snap to transfer pictures from the camera to the computer & it doesn't take long at all...even the first time.I ended up buying a battery charger because it didn't show as coming w/the camera, but it does.  So now I have a spare.  I would also buy a bigger memory card, because the 32 byte one that comes w/it will fill up real fast.  I bought one that came w/a free USB Reader.I can't recommend this camera enough to those that are not really sure what they want.  Again, very easy to use & learn to do some fun things w/it.4/14/11Over two years later & I still love this camera!  I carry it with me daily & use it all the time.  Even after all this time, it still takes pictures as great as it did on day one!  No complaints.  Not a one.  Definitely glad I bought it.

It takes excellent photos, it has a really fast start-up, and there is no delay between the time you press the button to when it takes a photo (unlike some other digital cameras I've had before).  The only bad thing is that when you are taking a video and you zoom in, the image gets all pixelated and there is major loss of details.  So if you take a lot of videos with your digital camera and that is a major requirement for you, I wouldn't recommend this camera.

I chose this camera because of it's price, size, and picture quality. I'm not even close to being a professional photographer, but I have been wanting to get more into it and needed at least 10MP to take the pictures I wanted to.Pros: A decent range of menu and function options, excellent resolution on pictures, lightweight & compact (fits in my pocket). When I started to browse the options in the main and function menus, I was a little overwhelmed because none of my other cameras had so many settings. I HIGHLY recommend reading the user manual, it answered all of my technical questions regarding this camera. Once you know how to change the settings to fit your environment, this little camera takes beautiful pictures, especially in digital macro mode, which I've always had trouble with on other cameras. The image stabilization is good, too. Only a few of my digital macro pictures have come out blurry, because I was not using a hard surface or tripod. The camera lets you know when it is \"shaking\" too much, which I find to be rather helpful. Another thing I particularly like (which is probably pretty common with more recent cameras I'm sure) is face detection.Cons: The little cover for the cable to connect the camera to the computer is a little annoying, it kind of gets in the way while you're plugging in the cable.. Also, the cord doesn't go in very well, I had to push a little harder than I'd like with a piece of equipment. I'm worried about this breaking before its time.It may have just been my computer, who knows, but when I loaded the software that came with the camera I chose to manually install because I didn't want the image viewer it came with (I like to use Preview on my Mac). When I tried to transfer the images to my computer though, it didn't work. I went back and installed the image viewer and voila, no problem. Seeing as how it was separate from the other two items to install, I assumed I could live without it, but apparently not and I really didn't want to add 300MB worth of something I didn't even want to my computer.Overall, this is a cool camera and I'm definitely happy with it.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Warren E.

This camera fits the bill without being relatively expensive.  I am pleased with the small size and the pictures look good as was expected. However, I received a benefit I was not anticipating in the video performance. At no zoom the video quality (in my opinion) is equal or very close to the quality of my sony digital 8 camcorders and even my canon mini dvd camcorder. The video quality deteriorates rapidly after 2x magnification and I would recommend no one using 3.5 x magnification on video. That being said, I then purchased some 8gb and 16gb sd cards and I am a very happy guy (8gb just over 1 hour video length and 16gb 2+ hours video). I used this christmas eve and the next day took out the sd card and transferred the files to harddrive and opened windows vita home premium movie maker and dropped them into it and made a quick title and added some pictures (with this camera also) to the storyline with the video clips and chose to make a dvd and 45 minutes later I took my dvd over to the inlaws and relatives to enjoy watching on christmas day. It looked very impressive playing thru their dvd player upon the 50 inch lcd tv. I am now of the opinion that I will seldom use my other camcorders unless my subject is far away and zooming becomes necessary. It was much faster dropping the sd card into the harddrive vs. hooking up the 1394 cable. Give it a try without using the zoom and I think you too will be impressed.......Just as a side note I want to let people know who video that I am extremely unhappy with my 2 sony digital 8 camcorders no longer being recognized by plug & play when using 1394 firewire to windows xp & Vista home premium. I contacted sony and told them they both worked 3 months ago but not now, so is it new drivers being updated by MSFT??? They said they could not help, check with msft. I called msft and the guy said it's up to sony. A very frustrating experience and all I know is they both worked 3 months ago with plug & play and neither digital 8 work now and my computer has had a \"ton\" of msft updates hit it. Oh well, the canon mini dvd still works with the 1394 firewire on both xp & vista. I hope I don't download an update today and have that function vanish also (I'm quickly getting as many of my old vhs/digital 8 tapes/ and mini-dvd tapes put on a hard drive ASAP.

I don't like that you have to have a memory card in to use it, but with any camera you eventually will need a memory card so that's OK.  Another thing I really don't like is that you have to hold down the button for at least three seconds then let go, before it will take the shot.  Three seconds is not a long time but it seems like forever and people usually change their facial expression so you end up not capturing the moment.  There are a lot more things that I don't like about this camera than my old Sony DSC camera so I've only used it a couple of times and find myself not even wanting to take pictures because I know the quality is not going to be what I'm used to.

This camera is just an incremental update to previous models - nothing revolutionary, however the small details they did improve confirm there is not much they had to improve.Pros:* The price is great. I picked mine up for $140 on a Black Friday special - compare that to the $250+ a few years ago AND amazon.com gave me a free 4 GB SD card with it!* My fave feature after the price: Small, light, compact. Slips really easily into my jeans or jacket pocket.* The image stabilization appears to work very well. I've definitely noticed a little more crispness in my photos.* My previous Canon never had a problem with battery life and this one doesn't either.* I prefer the buttons to change settings used on the Canon rather than dials used on some Sony's that I was looking at. I found that the settings dials on the Sony tended to rotate when the camera was in my pocket. Changing settings on the Canon takes a firm depression of the buttons and I haven't had the same issue.Neutral:* I don't believe the 10 MP is that necessary - at least I don't use that much. I use it to hedge risk *in case* I ever print by archiving the full resolution.* The face recognition/focus feature is pretty cool but I haven't detected that much value in it.Cons:* I wish the screen was a little bigger, but understand the trade-off Canon made since making the screen bigger would have meant they couldn't have put in a view finder.* The size scale is not as granular as I would like. You can set pictures to 10 MP, 6 MP, 4 MP and a few others but not, for example, 8 MP. There may be technical details I'm not aware of OR the jump from 10 to 6 is the optimal one, but I would like a little more granularity.", "Date": "December 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "We Love our Powershot!", "Author": "B.

They said that the problem was now between me and FedEx. I advised that I didn't have a relationship to FedEx, but that they did. My relationship was to Canon, and I asked that Canon give me another camera while it was waiting to be paid by FedEx for the lost camera. Three CSRs separately refused, and said that they can't fix a problem like this quickly.I told them that if I told Amazon that I'd not gotten a product from Amazon, it would ship a replacement immediately.

The camera is much bigger than the SD500 that I upgraded from--even though it's got so many bells and whistles.  One thing about Canon that's got my eyebrow raised:  Why the big font as if we can't read?The Image Stabilization is a wonderful thing, right along with the face detection.  It even focused on an enlarged print of a little girl!  The 3.7 zoom is nothing to frown at either.  ISO is easier to set now so one can play around with the settings...The camera is made for \"big hands\" and it took me about two weeks of off and on shooting to get used to it.  The 12MP quality is okay, and I didn't have to get used to too much new button placement.  One thing I didn't like is the play button.  I felt I had to really push my finger on the play button in order to view my photos.  It annoyed me enough to see what else was out there.The Canons SD770 and SD790 were next on my list.  Even though they were \"only\" 10MP, they had newer technology from Canon:  Motion Detection and Infinity and cute buttons in all new small packages.SD770IS(Silver)First the SD770.  This was a nice small camera!  Not cheap feeling at all, Canon packed everything but the kitchen sink in there.  I like the \"Infinity\" setting that the SD950 didn't have.  Also, I have the silver version and it's nice, small, sleek, and takes great pictures.  I didn't like the way the battery cover was not spring loaded.  Also, either it was this particular camera or the 770 in general, but it seemed like I had to \"dig\" for the battery and SDHC card once put in.  Yes, it's compact, hefty, and full of bells and whistles, but it was...kinda boring.  Maybe because the silver color didn't have the pizazz of the black version that I'd read reviews on.  Moving on to the SD790...SD790ISBigger camera!  Compared to the 770, it's a giant!  The same size as the 950 except in a square/cube like form.  The 950 is curvy, while the 790 is sleek and boxy (not sure if that's an oxymoron or not!).  The 790 also has a new button format that I'm not sure if I like or not.  I really enjoyed the SD500's button placement and while I can appreciate a \"play\" button...why not make it easy access instead of having to constantly press the button down?  I'm thinking that the play buttons will eventually wear out.  The big screen is nice, and even though I haven't used a viewfinder since...ever, it would be nice to \"just have\".  So the lack of a viewfinder is a potential bummer.  You never know when you gotta smear your nose on the photo screen to take pic!  lol  Also, the 790 is a fingerprint magnet.I tried to take the same pictures with all the cameras, but couldn't always (morning/evening, different zoom, etc.).  Both the 770 and 790 have high ISO settings (as did the 950), but I didn't even use anything that high previously!  All the pictures came out great.  Even my crappy pictures of my messy coffee table were clear and colorful!  One issue I had with all three cameras was the color accent setting.  It seemed as if I got better black and white/one color photos from my SD500 than either of these cameras.  I have to do a lot more tweaking.  However, it could be just because of the balances of the colors and the lighting effects in my environment.If I just had to choose based on portability, photos, looks, bells/whistles, ease of use, I would go crazy trying to decide.  Both cameras are amazingly small!  The thing that keeps me wondering about the 770 is, \"how can they fit all these specs in this TINY camera!??  But, I'm a sucker for good looks, so the scale points back to the SD790!  True it's bigger than the 770, but it's still small considering the screen.  I always take great care of my electronics, so I'm not so worried about fingerprints.  If the button issue upsets me extremely, then I'll just upgrade to Canon's latest and greatest in 6-8 months.One more thing:  I purchased the SanDisk 4 GB Extreme III SDHC Card w/ MicroMate USB Reader and it gets 900ish pictures on the 10MP versions at the highest settings.Either way, can't wait to take pics on the new SD790.  I feel that although all three are great, the 790 has that sleekness with Canon's new technology all in one package.Get out, purchase any of these cams and you'd be satisfied.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "I'm in love...again!", "Author": "Jennifer Schwartz \"Jennifer Schwartz\"", "ReviewID": "R18G9W4FVJ5G8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my previous canon snap shot camera was accidentally hit by a flying ball and broken (it's okay, accidents happen!)

I ought to have returned it, but am a terrible procrastinator, and had done much research to select this one. It's my last (and THIRD) Canon Elph.I find the quality control on Canon Elph to be dismal. The gyroscope didn't work consistently after a month, so rotating the camera to look at pics was a pain.The focus features in auto and manual modes were not as clear as my previous model, somewhere in the 400s. Contrast was fuzzy.Many silly features that didn't seem to do much for the photos.It survived one drop onto concrete from standing height (abt 37\" at waist), which pleased me  no end! However, the second fall it took, from my 8-y-0 waist height, onto carpet, was its death sentence.The extending lens is jammed, and Canon's cost to look at the thing = $45 and repairs start at $130.That's more than half the cost of a new one.I bill this as a disposable camera.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon PwerShot SD770 IS", "Author": "Djar \"proud mommy\"", "ReviewID": "RYKVD3CCP8D0B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera because a friend has a similar model by Canon.

It has been a true work horse.  Since I do a fair amount of photography for a blog, I noticed this camera had more megapixels, slimmer case for carrying in pocket, a good-sized LCD screen and a very reasonable price.  I ordered it excitedly.  Of course all I thought about were the perceived advantages.  The camera menu and options are so complex and sophisticated that it took an electrical engineer, and computer techie and a 15 year old who uses electronics all the time -- plus the manual -- to even begin to figure some things out.  Very stressful.  After I took photos and plugged it into my computer to import photos to my iPhoto library -- it was chaotic.  The software was different now, and we did use the disk that came with it.  Photos no longer showed up in a linear fashion -- they were interspersed with old photos from way back.  We could not remedy this.  Well, I could go on about the difficulties, but I imagine you get the idea as a possible customer.

All of the reviews and ratings led us to purchasing the Canon SD790IS.  HOWEVER, no product review on Amazon or even the product description page informed us that the flash card that was included with the camera was only intended as a 'test card'.  We were so excited to use our new camera and then after only three photos and a FOUR second video, our camera started to flash \"Memory Card Full\".  We called Canon's Customer Service thinking something was wrong with our camera; however, they informed us that the 32MG flash card included with the camera was only intended to 'test' the camera to make sure it worked.  We actually called Canon Customer Service again to be sure this was correct information.  Well, it was apparently correct, and we were without a doubt annoyed that this information was not more prevalent in the product description.  The bottom line is this: BE AWARE that the camera does not work by just taking it out of the box.  You will need a flash card in addition to your purchase of the camera.  We just purchased an 8 GB card that won't arrive until next week, so we are still without a camera.  If we had known this information a bit sooner, it most likely would have affected our decision as to which camera to purchase in terms of budget.  DON'T BE FOOLED LIKE WE WERE!  As an aside, for anyone who is debating purchasing the Canon accessory kit (camera case, extra battery, and strap), we were very happy with the case, and you can't beat having an extra real Canon battery.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "I dont can to see the status tracking shipping, 7 days", "Author": "R.
