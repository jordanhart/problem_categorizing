The reason that I did not rate this higher is that the charger doesn't work.  I mean it's DOA, completely inoperative.  I'm sure it's just a defective unit that I was unlucky enough to get.  I have not bothered to return it because the cost of shipping it back far exceeds the price of the part, but for the inconvenience and added cost for me to replace it, I am dropping the star rating on this package.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "good deal", "Author": "stanley g finch", "ReviewID": "RUX5V6EY67TUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got a Panasonic ts5 camera for vacation to Hawaii but assumed I could easily get extra batteries locally.  I was wrong and scrambled to order some extras online and found this nicely priced kit, especially when compared to namebrand Panasonic extras.This includes 2 batteries and the charger either plugs into a typical wall socket or 12 volt port on your car, which the name brand Panasonic charger that came with my camera did NOT feature.So everything works and the price was less total than a single replacement battery from Panasonic!Also seller delivered quick and I got the package a day ahead of estimated delivery date in Hawaii while on vacation.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "novastorm \"novastorm\"", "ReviewID": "R3F9SYGPT0XF4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These batteries seem to work the same as OEM and for the money, the batteries and charger are a great deal.
