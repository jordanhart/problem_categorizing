{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Missing items in bundle purchase", "Author": "X. Ross \"XR\"", "ReviewID": "R2MFWZFQIUY3KM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My order was received in a timely manner.  However I did not receive all of the items as described in the item description. I order the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS30 bundle. Which in the description includes the following.Panasonic Lumix ZS30 Wi-Fi Digital Camera  (Got that)Transcend 32GB SDHC 300x Card (Received two 16 GB cards) Ok....Spare DMW-BCM13 Battery (Got that.) To my surprise, it\u2019s an actual Panasonic battery! I was expecting a generic brand.Zeikos 50\" Compact Tripod (Kinda got that) The description is a 50\" tripod. I got some sorta 3 legged flexing wire thing.  Guess it\u2019s a desktop tripod?Lowepro Rezo 50 Camera Case (Sorta got that too) I got a purple purse.  Again, not as described.HDMI to Micro-HDMI Cable (Didn't get that)PD SDHC Memory Card Reader (Didn't get that)5pc Complete Cleaning Kit (Got that)PD Memory Card Storage Wallet  (Didn't get that)LCD Monitor Screen Protectors (Got that)Image Recovery Software (Didn't get that)Some of the items in the \"bundle\" I really didn\u2019t need, or want for that matter, but point is that I paid for what was in the description.  I guess it's my fault. I didn't read the seller's reviews first.  It appears that this is typical of the seller.  However, you should get what you pay for.  I plan on sending a request of the rest of the items that I paid for.  I plan on posting the result of that.  At this point I can't recommend buying this item.  At least not from this seller.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$379.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 11 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Panasonic Lumix ZS30 Wi-Fi Digital Camera (Black) + <2> Transcend 32GB SDHC 300x Card +\n<3> Spare DMW-BCM13 Battery + <4> Zeikos 50\" Compact Tripod + <5> Lowepro Rezo 50 Camera Case +\n<6> HDMI to Micro-HDMI Cable (6') + <7> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <8> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<9> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <10> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors + <11> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS30 Wi-Fi Digital Camera (Black) with 32GB Card + Battery + Case + Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JAb4rzsiL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00COMS504"}}
