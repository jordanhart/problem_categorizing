I have an Olympus E300 SLR camera but it is hard to carry it around and all the lenses on trips and such.(Weighs about 3.5 pounds) So I wanted a second portable camera that could match the quality but would not break the bank. This camera takes awesome photos! Lighting fast start up time! I love the metal orange front. It looks so much more sleek and metallic in person than the stock photos.Many settings for people that want a point and shoot.IA setting automatically picks the right setting for your photo. So cool! The HD recording looks so sharp. My only complaints are the menu system is very simple and boring,the optical zoom is kinda slow and in HD recording it is about 1MB a second. So the files can get pretty huge when you film a lot.Amazing camera at a great price! I 100% recommend it!**UPDATE** After only 20 days of super light use, this camera broke! The lens cover sensor stopped working and even when the lens cover was open, the camera thought it was closed. So I can't take any pictures! So disappointed. Sending it back to Amazon for a replacement. Hopefully this second one will work better.***UPDATE*** Replacement camera is working very well. No problems so far. I am extremely careful with the sliding lens cover though. Amazon returns was a breeze. Easiest return and I received my replacement camera in only 3 days.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "great camera-Very fast focus", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R1ZINCLYODYP6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a very compact, lens in the body camera to take backpaking / hikingWanted MP range of 10 to 12Camera works great, open the cover & it's ready to go.well made metal body & cover slides easy.Very fast focus, push the take a photo button and it takes the photo = no adjustment time.I have taken photos driving down the highway = image comes out clear and sharp.Only bad thing for me at this time (very minor) is camera is heavier then you'd think. Also has small surfaces to hold on to. I have not figured out how to hold it with one hand yet, my hand size is Medium-large golf glove.I've taken 100 shots total so far with flash or with out flash & the battery is still showing 100%.Macro focus works awesome.Plus = has a camera stand screw mount on the bottom.I have only used the camera in default mode, not done anything fancy yet. works great for me.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Mostly pleased", "Author": "Pattyd", "ReviewID": "R3BF17O9ZJAURI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After researching point and shoot cameras for quite a while, I decided to order the Panasonic Lumix. [I recently dropped my Canon Power Shot A570 and ruined the zoom lens beyond repair.I was getting pretty desperate for a replacement!]When I received my new camera, I was amazed at the new technology developed in such a short period of time. Everything about my new camera was easier, including no more expensive batteries to buy. I love everything about the Lumix with just one exception, I don't think the pictures are as clear upon processing as my old camera. They looked great in the camera playback, but when I downloaded them I found some shots were hazy in quality, very few blurry 2 of 142, and several spectacular. Maybe it's just my initial outing with the camera and as I use it I'll take better shots. Mostly, I feel I got a bargain in this purchase.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Takes pixs!", "Author": "jane123", "ReviewID": "R14EW8LRVJXAIO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Im not a big tech person.

I looked at several camera, probably the same ones you have, read the reviews trying to separate the bad from the good.I am tickled pink by this camera. It starts quickly and shuts down quickly.  No waiting around. It produces pictures of great clarity and I'm very pleased with the glass. I went with the 8GB SD class 6 memory card, which holds 1849 12MP images.The camera writes images to the card amazingly quickly and had no problem shooting as quickly as I wanted to, once I turned down the image review time in the menu.The camera also shoots HD video and I was very satisfied with the quality of the image and audio.The controls are easy and intuitive. The autofocus appears top-notch.The only cons I can think of are the that it only has a 4x zoom, which still provides plenty of pull, but it's not a telephoto or long distance zoom if that's what you're looking for. The other con is that the battery life seems to follow the stated life exactly, about 300 images.  Perhaps a little less if one plays around with the controls alot.  But a second battery is cheap, so this isn't really a problem.I may buy another I like this one so much.  One for my pocket, one for the car.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Monee", "ReviewID": "R3D2R5YJQFLMNP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave this camera to a friend for Christmas and she said it is the best she's ever owned. Picture quality is excellent, sharp and beautiful. There is no delay in pic taking like some digital cameras where you miss your shot waiting. She has a baby and baby's don't wait for a pic. The size is great for stowing in a purse or pocket. Excellent purchase so don't miss this one.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Most reliable camera takes good pictures, but buy a good SD card!!", "Author": "Mock Trial Student", "ReviewID": "R23VK9RBKKH0BB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a three year old Canon with a broken lens. I think it will last longer than the Canon, since it has a lens barrier that slides down to protect the lens. It is really thin and easy to use, although it is wider than most cameras in it's price range. The fun colors make it easy to recognize your camera out of a crowd, since there are not that many bright orange cameras around. Picture quality cannot be beat, and the movies look like they came from an HD camcorder. You do have to get a large SD card if you want to take full HD video and 12 megapixel shots, but the camera will let you lessen the resolution to fit more video and pictures if you want to use the built in memory or a smaller card. I have a 2GB card, and it stores hundreds of pictures, and around a half hour of decent quality video. I would get a bigger card if I wanted to take a lot of HD video. The menus are much easier to use than those of the Canon, but it takes a few button presses to go from photo to video mode. Overall, it really works well, and it is the best camera I ever had. I take this on school trips, and the image quality and quickness of the shutter really impresses my friends. When you have a life full of action, you want a camera that has a great shutter speed, good battery life, and excellent reliability, and this definitely is it.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "exactly as i expected.", "Author": "little mosquito", "ReviewID": "RELSVKJMGYV6X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this camera when it was on sale for $80, worth more than the price. this camera is like point and shoot, doesn't need a long time to wait for it to focus. takes great and clear pictures too. pocket size, colorful.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "good camera for the $$$", "Author": "Gilbert Gomez \"tusabes\"", "ReviewID": "RFLZASU14G0O9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very easy to use.

Orange is very cool. I have an orange case for it, making it virtually impossible to misplace. The orange jumps out. I've been a bit spoiled by using a Sony camcorder as my \"camera\" of choice for years now. The Sony camcorder does great photos, but is just too big to lug around. The LUMIX is a wonderful size, shape, and weight. My experience so far has been very good. I need to learn more about the camera, but everything so far has worked nicely. It's pretty straightforward. Instructions and usage is reasonably clear. At some point you just have to fiddle around with it to learn its real capabilities. That's where I am now. But I do like it. A couple of my pictures have been a bit fuzzier than I expected, but that was my fault for not holding as still as I should have. This is where the Sony may have spoiled me. The stabilization in the Sony camcorders seems to be better than whatever is in the LUMIX. Knowing that just means adjusting one's approach to taking pictures a bit. That's ok. The LUMIX was recommended to me by a professional and I did a ton of research, only to decide that this did look like the best bet.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just so so", "Author": "Marie Grace \"Fanny\"", "ReviewID": "RHVLH3DKF0KR3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this for my mum and it is not as good as I expected.The big problem is it is not user friendly.

Like Many others have said, the lumix FP1 shoots very blurry and glary pictures. \"Like shooting through a smoke-filled room.\" The pictures are very dark an the focusing area is extremely limited, everything around the focusing point is unclear, like cellphone pictures, there is no backlight compensation, and the white balance makes almost no difference. This gets much worse when taking night pictures with the flash. I think this is due to a low sensitivity sensor and weak flash.I'm not a camera expert but certainly I know a thing or two about cameras. I own an LX3 and ZS7 which take flawless pictures no matter the lighting condition. I do know how to operate the zoom, focus, iso, shutter, and the different scene modes of the lumix line, but it is hard to get the pictures right.Probably this is a different version of the FP1, hence the low price.I would have returned this if I could, but I live in another country nd it would cost the same to ship it back.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very lousy pictures", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "RG8WEM7GVXYHO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera shoots very blurry pictures, especially in the low light condition, I don't know why so many people rated so high on this camera.
