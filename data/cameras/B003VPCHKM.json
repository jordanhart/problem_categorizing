This camera has a very clear picture (640x480) and is better that other camera's I have used.  I use this camera with Firefox at home and from work.  I am surprised how clear and what great frame rate I see, it looks like a live video camera verses the blurry web-cams I am used to seeing.  It even works on my Android phone.I got this camera because it is wireless and supports G, it also supports wired network connection.  You have to connect it wired first to configure it for your home wireless network then you can place it anywhere in your home wireless range.  The only wire you will have is the one for power.This camera is able to pan so I can look around the room to see what the cats are up too.  The night vision IR LEDs are bright so even in a dark room you get a clear picture.  I have recently purchased another one for monitoring my front door and front yard.This camera also has audio so you can hear what is going on near the camera and it also has a speaker so you can send audio back to the camera and speak to a person near the camera.  That feature requires Internet Explorer because it has a ActiveX plug-in to perform Audio functions.  I do not use this feature so I can not comment on it.This camera blinking light on the front while it is on, and may make some audible sounds while panning so it is not designed as a \"spy-cam\"After showing some co-workers the quality of the picture and panning abilities they also purchased this camera and are also happy with it.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wireless pain to connect; but good for the money.", "Author": "Jeremy C.", "ReviewID": "R16V24WNDIFEUN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Edit: Changed from 1 to 3 stars after vender reply.Pros: cheap and better quality camera picture than some of the others in the same price range.Cons: I tried a lot of things, and the wireless just would not work work.

What I found was that the instruction manual, though there were some minor grammatical errors, was perfectly clear and adequately illustrated.  It should enable anyone at all who can follow simple directions in the order presented to have the camera functioning in short order. No special technical skills are required, just follow the directions.  The software tool supplied will give you the specific IP address of your camera, if it's not printed on the bottom tag.  Its web server is built into the camera and, after setup, it's accessed via any browser from any computer anywhere on the planet.  It's controlled from the computer's browser, but, if you want to use the built-in microphone, speaker and video recording functions, you must use Internet Explorer. Be sure to activate the Active X controls in the browser.The camera is plug and play capable for automatic port forwarding, if you need that. I had to do nothing in setup except to select my home network's name from the list and enter my encryption key.Of course, the images are in color unless at night when the infra-red lamps come on and the images are B&W.;  IR range is quite good. You can adjust resolution, frequency, brightness and contrast but not color characteristics.The system requirements listed are in excess of what's really needed to control and use the camera.  I set it up with an advanced PC and then switched to a very old laptop with half the power they said I would need and the results were more than satisfactory.I've seen what appear to be identical cameras of this type marketed by several vendors at very different prices. I would just choose the cheapest.  It cannot be used outside but does have an \"outside\" setting if you want to aim it through a window.

NOPE.This camera is much lower quality than the one they advertize. The picture is much grainier and fuzzier, the color saturation at medium light levels is absolutely horrible, and the automatic IR illumination has very few stages... it's essentially either on or off (unlike the real Apexis, which has an impressive progressive illumination). You can clearly see all of this from the two screenshots I uploaded, one from a real Apexis (bought via Amazon from another vendor), the other from this EasyN device.The sad part is, not only is it a different brand, the part number is nothing remotely close to what they list on the product page, it's FS-613A-M136, not APM-J011-WS.Edit: There was only one good thing I can say about this transaction, Amazon's (Prime) shipping was incredibly fast...

The program did not exist on the cd so after emailing the seller I received a link to be able to download the program and the download worked.2. The manual stated I would have a registration code either on the cd itself or at the end of the manual for the management software program. Wasn't in either location so another email to the seller got me a response with a registration code.3. Wireless connection would not work and I am quite familiar with getting devices connected to my wireless network. After trying many things I realized that the MAC address supplied by the camera was not the same for both the lan connection and the wireless connection. Since I have my wireless locked down to only allowing the MAC addresses that I specify this was a significant issue and the seller was unable to provide me details on how to determine the actual wireless MAC address of the camera.4. Returned the camera and am currently waiting for a refund.As far as the camera functionality (when connected to the lan) it had a decent picture and a substantial range of motion.

Granted, my network uses the 10.0.0.0/24 addressing scheme instead of the 192.168.0.0/24 or 192.168.1.0/24 scheme but that doesn't matter. So, after some thought, I hardwired my computer to my network (my 802.3 and 802.11 networks use the same addressing scheme and have all the same permissions and access) and then it found the cameras and I was able to statically set the IP addresses to what I wanted them to be.

Some of the prior reviews made me hesitant to buy this.I'm glad that I made the purchase because it does exactly what I need it to do. It's function in our home is a day/night baby monitor and it's great picture quality. It was also easy to set up - attach the antenna, plug in the power, plug in the network cable, run the software and move to the desired location. Done! Once accomplished, up to 9 devices can view, tilt, and pan the camera remotely.The camera gives a great picture and it automatically adjusts to 'night vision' in low and no light conditions. A prior review stated that there is a blinking light on the camera when active. I painted over this light with nail polish before I discovered you can disable this status light in the settings.I'm considering buying a second and third unit for the home.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera -- Awful Instructions", "Author": "John L. Gerlaugh", "ReviewID": "R3CB788SUJJW5B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought two of these cameras for the same reason as the previous reviewer did -- to monitor the activity of my cats, one or both of whom are making undesirable deposits behind the couch.  I wanted a low-light motion-detection camera that would take a video of what's happening, then store a recording of the \"activity\" to my computer's hard drive, and hopefully notify me that a recording had been made.  Interpreting the Chinese-written-in-English users manual was comical but very frustrating, and I got as far as being able to see the camera's activity in a browser window on my network, but that was it -- could not for the life of me figure out how to do anything more complicated than that, and I'm not a computer novice.  I sent an e-mail to customer support (in China) -- it was never answered.  Their website is less than useless for help.  If you just want to sit at your computer and monitor activity in another room in real time, it's easy to do with this one, but don't expect to easily go further than that to make the camera really useful when you're not around.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really good for the price.. but need to be a bit geek", "Author": "bioranieri", "ReviewID": "R218K1Q9B89SYG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really good for the price.. but need to be a bit geek to configure.
