{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy P&S; camera to use", "Author": "The WB", "ReviewID": "R2ZBXZAWKP0OP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I happened across this camera while searching for a small P&S; camera that I could take anywhere.  There are times a cell phone camera cannot do the job properly.  Having used this camera for 4 months and taken several thousand pictures, here is what I have experienced:Good:* 2 AA battery power -- if they die, obtaining suitable replacements is very easy.* Using AA NiMH batteries -- I get about 300 pictures per set of 2,300 mAh batteries.* 10.1 MP sensor - 4:3 is default resolution ratio, but it has the capability of shooting 3:2 (at 9 MP size).* 1/2.33\" CCD sensor - quite standard* 5X optical zoom - Equivalent to 35 MM to 175 MM.* Macro mode with focus down to 3\"* Live histogram, but has to be turned on each time the camera is powered up* SD and SDHC card capacity - I've used up to a 4 GB SDHC card with no problems.* Mini-USB cable (nonstandard) connection for picture transfer.* Three light meter modes -- Spot, center weighted and AiAE (a complex full frame evaluation mode).The Bad:* Close distance flash shots wash out the subject -- in camera metering of the flash is bad.* Transferring more than 50 pictures at a time via USB cable will cause the camera to crash.* A rectangular shutter button that is a bit stiff to operate at times.* Spot metering tends to wash out pictures.  The best mode is AiAE (complex metering)* The histogram cannot be programed to remain on all the time* EV setting is a bit tedious -- the effect takes once the EV choice has turned off.  It must be restarted each time you want to make an exposure adjustment* The LCD lighting on auto mode tends to show the preview exposure too dark, when, in fact, the exposure is quite good.* Awkward placement of the zoom rocker switch* Framing grid lines are a mid-gray color and are hard to see in sunny conditions.  No provision to change the color.I wrote Customer Service regarding the histogram and grid line issues.  Within 24 hours, they responded.  There is no provision to change the default programing of features on this camera.  They suggested a firmware update, but for this model, GE posted Version 1.10 on the support website.  I have Version 1.11 on my camera.My real test was on a cross-country trip this past April, where I took this camera, a Canon A590 and a Fujifilm S100FS.  The pictures taken with the GE were sharp and clear, when they were outside and in AiAE metering mode.  Taking pictures in landscape mode was a mixed bag - greens were overblown and reds were suppressed.Also, this is an economical P&S; camera.  Don't expect perfect live action shots, unless you crank up the ISO speed to the point the pictures are all grainy.  I learned to keep this camera at ISO 100 for the vast majority of my pictures.  There is an automatic scene detection mode that works, but it too is a mixed bag.  I've shot outdoor pictures of plants in bright sunlight and had the camera turn on the flash as if it was in Sunset mode and backlit subject.  Go figure.Facial recognition works good for this price camera.  Two faces are easily recognized.  When taking flash pictures of people, be careful.  If you are too close, the flash will wash out the persons face.  The metering system and the flash output appear to be separate, so there is no TTL metering of the flash to limit the flash output.  Also. red eye reduction shooting fires 4 times before the image is captured.  The subjects (especially small children) close their eyes and you get a blink picture.  Children mode completely suppresses the flash altogether.The long and the short of it, I found the best mode to shoot in was pure manual mode, where I can set everything (with the aid of the histogram) in AiAE metering mode to capture the correct exposure.  It worked just fine with good tonal reproduction in the final product.  I'm posting some sample pictures with this review.  They represent a cross section of my experiences.CS is responsive, unlike other companies out there.  Build quality is good, but don't expect it to hold up to pure torture.  Overall, for the price I paid, the features and the picture quality, I happened upon a good camera.*****11/19/2010 - UpdateI have used this camera now for just over 7 months and have taken about 3,000 pictures.  If you work with this camera in manual mode with white balance and the histogram to set the exposure, you get some really good results.Battery life is great, even when using the flash.  The NiMH \"AA\" batteries I have nets me about 300 pictures per set of two, more than enough for a decent day's shoot.The only real complaint I have is with the Auto Focus -- if you push this camera, especially when it is really bright outside, the AF will not set properly.  You have to wait for the on-screen focus indicator to turn green before you take the picture, or it will be blurred.  This camera fires as soon as the shutter is fully depressed regardless of focus.*****7/7/2011 - Update7(+) more months have passed and this camera is still going strong.  I have lost count as to how many pictures have been taken, but I can say \"a whole lot.\"  I don't take this camera with me to as many places as I use to in the past since I purchased an iPhone 4.  For a cell phone with a fixed focal length lens, it takes some real good quality pictures, in the right lighting conditions.In other reviews of this camera, people have complained about this camera being 1) a battery eater and 2) blurry images. Let me try to help clarify these two criticisms with possible solutions.1) Having two A1050 GE cameras (one for me and the other for my son's girlfriend) we have not experienced this issue.  On average, with mixed flash and non-flash pictures, we get about 300 pictures per charged set of two AA batteries.  Why do we have get so many pictures out of a set of batteries?  We exclusively use rechargeable Energizer (the old Everyready Battery Co) Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) 2,300 or 2,450 mAh \"AA\" batteries.  I have used Duracell NiMH and cheaper, no name NiMH batteries with horrible results in this and other digital camera's. Through trial and error over the years using and owning several different \"AA\" powered digital camera's, I can only recommend Energizer's with any confidence.  I sound like a crummy commercial, but this continues to be my experience.  Energizer's will perform for the long haul and recharge quickly with a good quality rapid battery charger.One more point, I use \"AA\" alkaline batteries only in a pinch when I absolutely need to keep shooting and fresh rechargeable's are not with me.  This camera and other \"AA\" cameras (like my wife's Canon Powershot A590) will eat alkaline batteries right up -- with or without the flash being used.  Using alkaline batteries exclusively will give you horrible battery performance that is unfairly reflected in this and any other \"AA\" battery powered camera.2) Blurry pictures.  Image stabilization in digital cameras is accomplished by two different methods.  The first method uses a motor/gyroscope setup that either shifts the lens or light sensor element or both to reduce shake/blur.  Whereas the second method automatically increases the ISO (film speed) of the camera to a faster shutter time and thereby reducing the chance of shake/blur.  This camera uses the second method -- Auto ISO increasing for stabilization.  While the ISO increase method sounds good, it is far from perfect.  Higher ISO settings produce an unwanted grain effect, especially when it is dark, sometimes to the point that the picture looks absolutely horrible, even when the camera is in perfect focus.  Classic case is an outdoor concert at night.  At full size on a computer, the picture is blotchy and unclear.I also do not like the GE's slow flash sync (1/30th of a second sync).  Pictures with motion using flash are often times blurry.  My Fujifilm S100FS stock flash syncs at a minimum of 1/60th and most times at 1/128th of a second.  At 1/128th of a second sync, this is truly stop motion with almost no blur.  Long flash sync time is a weakness in this camera.Also, as I commented earlier regarding the auto focus of this camera, you have to wait until this camera signals the subject is in focus.  Green brackets will appear either in the center of the picture, if face detection is turned off or around the faces of your subjects, if face detection is turned on.  It may take several half depressions of the shutter button to get the camera to properly focus and signal that the focus is correct, especially when it is really bright outside.  This GE camera will take the picture if you fully depress the shutter button regardless of focus.  You cannot push this camera to instantly focus on a subject and expect it to take a tack sharp picture each and every time.  Again, this is another limitation of this camera.*****12/21/2011 - UpdateStill going strong.  Took over 200 pictures this past November during hunting season in NW Michigan -- all came out great.  What can I say, for a small P&S; camera, you cannot beat it.Amazon now has a second supplier for this model camera found as GE A Series 10.1-Megapixel Digital Camera - Black/Silver A1050BK-CP.

But I also had some basic requirements: decent resolution and optical zoom (at least 5x), the use of AA batteries, and a price within $100. Most of the latest thin cameras use proprietary lithium-ion batteries, but these need re-charging and if you run out of power on the go, you are stuck. It is easier to simply pop into any local store in the world and buy a few AA batteries.The GE A1050 is great for me, as it fits the above bill very nicely. Granted it is not as thin as other models, but this unit still fits easily in my shirt pocket and does not weigh it down. The picture quality is great and the video mode is also handy when I do not have my more bulky camcorder with me. Photos are sharp and print very well. Nice LCD screen size too.I am yet to explore any settings beyond the typical ones accessed via the external buttons. Overall, a very good general-purpose point-and-shoot device. I was slightly skeptical about the GE brand for cameras, but I believe they have done well with this model.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not as good as it appears", "Author": "Richard Widman \"Richard\"", "ReviewID": "R3EYXKPFXKGC1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this for my daughter to take pictures of her twins, but she has given it back. The zoom is good, but there are two critical points that make it not very usable for taking pictures of young children or anything moving. Maybe ok for scenery with caution and small fingers.1st is that the little button to take the picture is small and flat, causing you to accidentally move the camera when you push it, giving a blurry image.2nd is that it takes too long to take and save the picture, to you want to take a second shot and it can't since it is apparently still saving the first one. This results in many missed shots.My daughter went back to her old Sony, My wife prefers her older Sony, and I prefer my Samsung.

You can narrate your pictures with audio clips with the internal microphone also. Takes great pictures when your still and in adequate light right out the box.

You just to give the camera time to focus itself.So, when you use it just standing still press the button in a little let the camera focus til you like the picture then mash it it and you get a great picture. Otherwise, it might be out of focus.Video is great! Better quality video then my flip and a nice upgrade over my 5 megapixel camera.While the lens cover seems flimsy, it serves it function and gets out of the way I turn on the camera and snaps shut when I am finished.

Both have 5X optical lens image stabilization, neither dropped audio while zooming, but both 'stepped' the zoom while recording- the GE 'stepped' less though- maybe the video capability of these probably won't be what a camcorder can offer, but it is there for convenience. The Fuji video specs out an HD resolution, though not at 30 FPS, the GE does well in low light and I am surprised how well it holds up even on a 32\" standard def TV-The select wheel on the GE I found faster to use than the menu system on the Fuji, at least for me.

I ordered a GE A1050 digital camera. I received a GE J1050. The difference was the J model has a square battery that charges inside the battery. The A model (which I wanted) uses regular AAA batteries that can be recharged outside the camera. The square battery for the J model cost $20! So - either you pay another $20 to get a spare battery recharged if you think you'll need additional battery power or you'll have to stop taking pictures until you recharge the one battery you do have. When I notified customer service of the mistake of sending me a J model camera instead of an A model they explained they were out of the A model and since they knew I needed a camera post haste (mine had been stolen on a trip) they sent the 'upgraded J model at no extra charge.'  I explained I didn't want the J model because of the battery. I didn't want a battery that had to be recharged inside the camera.  They tried to find me an A model through other vendors even though they weren't going to get anything out of the transaction and, in fact, lost money because they sent me a return label to send the camera back to them. I was notified by Amazon that credit had been given to my account within 7 days of sending the camera back.  Another thing customer service did for me - they told me to go ahead and use the J model camera until I got the label to send it back.  I was glad to try the camera out - only something was wrong - either the battery was defective or the camera was. I charged the battery pursuant to instructions and the camera never would come on. I tried several times to charge the battery so I don't know what was wrong - whether it was the camera or the battery but that solidified my decision not to accept the J model.  I just can't say enough about customer service though. They were GREAT. They sent me several emails concerning questions I had about the camera.  They tried to accommodate me at every turn.

Movie...well, when it uploaded to this macbook, it won't open at all.  Sometimes it opened, sometimes it won't or couldn't seem to open. But the rest is very good.  It is good for beginners to novice.Recommend this, I don't know because I'm still learning though even I haven't taken anymore pictures often.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible Pictures", "Author": "Jeanne C.
