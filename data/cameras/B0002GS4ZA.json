It can be connected to your home network through an ethernet cable or wirelessly (the initial setup has to be performed through the ethernet connection). Once you've properly configured it for wireless mode, you don't need a computer: just plug the power adapter into an outlet and place the camera wherever you want (within the range of your wireless network).Anyone can connect and view/control the camera remotely. If you have a broadband connection and know how to configure your router to open a port and assign it to the camera's IP address, you can see your webcam from anywhere in the world. Very handy to keep an eye on your office or empty apartment while you're away.The embedded web server supports access restrictions through passwords of course; and users can pan/tilt the camera lens -- the only drawback is that Internet Explorer is required to use the camera (the display and controls are handled through an ActiveX control, which basically means that only Windows PCs with IE will be able to use access it).Image quality is pretty good: you have a choice of straming video at 320x240 or 640x480 (at a reduced frame rate) and you can control brightness and video quality from remote. Users can also take 'snapshots' (i.e. save individual images).I have another wireless webcam (a Linksys WVC11B) and the Panasonic's image quality and features are definitely superior (on the other hand the Linksys is also $100 cheaper).The camera also offers additional advanced features like heat detection (which can turn the camera on automatically and send an email alert if someone, or something, warm gets within the sensor's range) and scripting. I've never used this, but I suppose it can be useful if you plan to set up the camera as part of a rudimentary security/surveillance system. Some cameras offer motion detection, but it can be triggered by changes in light -- heat detection seems to make more sense.Main caveat: configuration can be tough, especially if you're a newbie. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable and it still took me a while to get it work with my wireless network until I figured out that I had to set the WEP encryption mode to 'open key' on my wireless access point (shared key mode is not supported, though this fact is buried in the documentation).Overall, I recommend the BL-C30A but I wish Panasonic provided a way for non-IE users to access the camera (and the configuration software could also be vastly improved).", "Date": "November 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good, but not good enough for surveillance", "Author": "DS", "ReviewID": "REWWVUIJ8ASQU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me begin by offering my overall experience with this camera.  I had no difficulty at all setting it up for either wired or wireless operation.  The included software worked flawlessly allowing me to easily operate the pan and tilt operations, and allowing me to record sessions.For my purposes, my intention was to supplement a surveillance system I currently have in operation using two high resolution Toshiba network cameras.  I was hoping to be able to get half-decent quality from a camera costing about 1/2 of the cost of the Toshibas.  Unfortunately, that's what I got...about half the image quality.In general 640x480 does not provide sufficient resolution for surveillance as you cannot make out features in any detail.  For example, you may be able to see someone entering your home, but you'll never be able to identify that person.  Overall clarity was ok, better than, for example, another Linksys camera that I tried, but still I was unable to identify facial features in a person standing just 10 feet from the camera (using all of the highest image quality modes).  Comparing this to my Toshiba cameras operating at just 800x600 is like comparing night to day, as the Toshiba is able to distinguish relatively fine detail.All in all, for the price, it does what it advertises, and is better than other lower cost cameras that I've also tried (like the Linksys).  However, I've found no camera in this price range to be able to work as a true surveillance camera.

Here are step-by-step instructions for setting it up using a Mac (don't worry, the steps go by quickly!):1) Plug-in camera to AC and hold down the \"reset\" pin with a pen.  My computer would not recognize the camera until I physically reset it.2) Make sure camera switch is set to \"wired\".3) Connect the camera via Ethernet cable to you Mac.4) Temporarily give your Mac the manual IP address 192.168.0.5 and subnet 255.255.255.0 in the Network Prefs.5) Connect to the camera using Safari at address 192.168.0.253 - you should be able to see the settings page now.6) Click through the setup but say \"No\" when it asks if you want to \"go on the internet\".  This will make it try to find your router (which is not on the network) so don't do it.7) Enter 192.168.0.253 in Safari once again and it should take you to the Network Camera page.  You should have access to the camera controls after you click the \"Single\" tab at the top of the page.

Nonsense! If you have ever set up a wireless router on your network (and if you are looking at an 802.11 camera then you probably have) then you will have no problem with this device.  There are two less-than-obvious things you need to do to get working: 1) hardwire the camera via an Ethernet cable for the initial set up (camera default LAN IP is 192.168.0.253) and 2) download the 114-page PDF Operating Instructions from the Panasonic support page.  Ignore the included CD-ROM.I am using several Macs with OS X Tiger and Firefox and every single feature (there are so many!) works flawlessly. This includes  the live video, free DDNS service, FTP uploads, IR motion triggers, etc, etc.I am a little spoiled by the auto-focused quality of some Webcams like the iSight, so the Panasonic's image quality loses it a single Star rating.  But the Panasonic is a true network cam that requires no computer once it is programmed, and that makes it very, very cool.UPDATE SEPT 28 2006 : This unit keeps getting better. Panasonic updated the firmware for this netcam to Version 1.30 (look for it and the addendum to the operating manual on the product support page).  The new firmware provides several neat new features.  The most significant may be the addition of image-based motion detection.  This is far more versatile and more controllable than the IR heat sensor.  It also allows motion detection through a glass window, i.e like when watching the driveway from indoors.  The unit can be set to send an email when motion is detected.  I could not find a Mac browser that would properly display the motion detection preview image, but this is not necessary to using the motion detection feature.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best wireless camera I have tried", "Author": "F.

Li", "ReviewID": "RSL96X5R4MLKM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly, let me state that I do not own this product, but as of only a few hours ago, I almost bought it.The reason I am writing this review is because over the past few days I have been doing a lot of research, and learnt many things which I felt I should share with others.My focus originally centered upon the Sony SNC M3W, this Pananosic model, the Linksys, and the Dlink. Very soon, for reasons I won't mention, it became clear that the choice was between the Sony and the Panasonic.I really liked the Sony, as it had virtually all the features I wanted, the main purpose of which was to allow me to monitor my baby who is about to be born. The features important to me are that it should be wireless, and allow me to hear my baby (ie., has built in mic).  Of course, the picture quality is important too.In terms of these features, that is where the Sony shines and the Panasonic falls. Sony not only has a built-in mic, but also lets you hook up speakers, so that not only can I hear my baby, I can TALK to her.The Panasonic, unfortunately, can do neither. This was a big disappointment for me, because I think apart from that, the Panasonic picture quality is better (I was comparing in the shop).The key advantage of the Panasonic over the Sony, which is where Sony falls, is that Sony's wireless standard only supports 801.11b, and does not support 801.11g. If your wireless router is 'b', then it makes no difference to you. However, 'b' routers are increasingly out of date as 'g' is much faster, and if you have a 'g' router like me, then even though you can still use the Sony, your entire wireless network will have to run on the slower 'b' standard because of the Sony. I was unwilling to make that compromise, so I very reluctantly had to dismiss the Sony too.btw, another difference between the Sony and Panasonic is that the Panasonic does not have motion detect (a feature I'd like to have for surveillance purposes). instead, it relies on 'heat sensing' to determine whether there's a person present. I dunno, but that didn't appeal to me.So which camera had everything I wanted? It was actually ANOTHER Panasonic outdoor surveillance camera. That was a beautiful and wonderful product, which I don't think they sell here on amazon. The problem was, it cost almost twice as much as this Panasonic. That model series begins with a C. I couldn't fault it in any way, except for the price. It also uses a ccd lens which is much better tha the CMOS lens that both this Panasonic and the Sony uses, giving superior picture quality. Well, that's why the cost is much higher, and also cos it's designed so that you can even use it OUTDOOR.So which camera did I end up with? A very little known brand called Planex. ([...]  It was priced at the same range as the Sony and thsi Panasonic, ran on wireless 'g', uses a ccd lens, had a built-in mic, could pan-tilt at a much larger angle, but the only drawback (very sad) was that it wouldn't let me hook speakers up to it - ie., I won't be able to talk to my baby... Pity they don't sell the product here.To close, I'd like to come back to this Panasonic model. The downside (to me very big) is that it has no audio features (can't listen, and can't talk through it), and has no motion detect (only heat detect). The best thing about it is that it runs on wireless 'g', has great picture quality, and one more thing - if you have multiple Panasonic cameras, the interface is great for hooking them all up, and that's even if you have different Panasonic models. Even though this model had no audio features, I still debated getting it, so that in case in the future I splurge out money to get the C series Panasonic one I mentioned above, I could still hook them all up together seamlessly.  And Panasonic is probably the strongest brand for surveillance cameras because they have been in this field for a long time.  So, if you dont' care about the audio features, or motion detect, then this would make the perfect camera at this price point.Anyway, hope my research helps you to make your decision.", "Date": "October 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Has Great Developer Access", "Author": "Benjamin J. Sintay", "ReviewID": "RXAPKMUZLDJ03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I didn't find this camera very difficult to setup.  It's important that you understand wireless networking somewhat before getting any product like this.  Also, to get to the webcam from outside of your firewall (or router), you must forward port 80 which may be a pain if you already have a web server running.I bought this camera specifically because it has timed FTP transfer.  I needed a solution that could handle a lot of users and since live video on a home network to thousands of users is NOT feasible with a simple plug-and-play solution like this, I was hopeful of uploading an image every second or so.  This proved to be slower than I thought.  First of all, you can only select buffering (snapshot) time intervals of 1 sec, 1 min, or 1 hour.  This is not much of a choice.  Second, the 1 second mode is too slow.  It can't FTP out the images fast enough to make it even close to what I wanted.  The images come about 15 to 30 seconds delayed and the system for doing this is so-so.  I found that the system operated perfectly at 1 minute, so if this is all you need than the FTP option is right for you.I was really frustrated at this point until I discovered the CGI documentation for this line of cameras.  I haven't seen anyone else comment on this so I wanted to for all of the developers out there.  Panasonic thought ahead when developing this product and made it such that you can issue CGI commands via HTTP1.0 (or 1.1) to make the camera do things or to acquire images.  For my system this proved to be an absolutely perfect answer to my problem.  I can call the camera with HTTP1.1, HTTP authentication, and a custom CGI and acquire the image on the screen at rates of 1 image per second with great results!  There is no problem with the camera lagging at all.  Best of all, almost everything you can do in the camera's admin panel can be done via CGI calls.I also found that this camera does a decent job at night (using it to look outside), but as others have said is not good if you want to make out a ton of detail in someone's face for instance.  The camera is also doing great being exposed to temperatures of 20 degrees F (in a garage) and hasn't froze or needed to be reset since I installed it a few weeks ago.  The wireless range is really good... I am running the cam across the street to my wireless network with no problems.For awesome customization and access via CGI, I'm giving this camera 5 big stars.

I used a windows XP pc to configure all three items - the DSL, the wireless, and the webcam.You'll be ok following the directions, and the CD setup works ok for the most part but if you don't get immediate internet connection (like I didn't) you will have to call up your web-based configurations and go into your wireless and/or DSL routers and do more than just enable port forwarding.You will have to make sure the SSID (the name of your wireless router, if you have one) is the same for your webcam and all routers.You must enable port forwarding on all routers.  The wireless router should have the IP number and port of the webcam, and the DSL router should have the global network address and its port.

Both are approximately the same price $299, but can be found priced lower on the Web.  There are several issues that make the BL-C30 a superior pick over the Veo as well as other competitors.  First is the ease of installation, the BL-C30 uses an Ethernet cable connection for set up while the Veo uses a propriety Rs232 cable.  This is one to the reasons I purchased the Veo, because I could not find the cable to reset one of the Veo cameras.The other advantage of the Panasonic is the software. Both in set up and operation, the BL-C30 performed without problems, not so with the Veo which is problematic in  both set up and operation.  Bottom line the Panasonic BL-C30 is easy to set up and use and for the price, a good choice for home security.

We had a vacation/business trip to Germany, the Panasonic Wireless camera performed great. The reason I purchased wireless was because I did not have network to our barn, about 150 feet, unfortunately the camera did not pick up the wireless signal at that distance. With little time left before we had to go I ran a network cable and plugged it into the camera. We mounted the camera above the stall, the image is very usable, although not great. My wife put a laptop next to the bed and ran the connection all night long, never a problem. Panning the camera is a great plus, digital zoom just made the blockyness bigger, not very usesful. The camera as been working for over 4 weeks and still going without any problems. I wished we had sound, I did not find any cameras without spending at least double the cost of this camera, for us sound was a wish not a need. As a plan B for the watching a foal I hooked up a usb webcam a PC and used skype with auto answer and always send video settings on, the skype solution worked with some sound but you need a PC running and the webcam did not pan or tilt.Overall no bad experiences, I'd put the range as under 100 feet, I'd recommend under 75, having the wired connection is a good fallback option.

Image Quality - Better than I expected for a camera at this price point.  Very good in good lighting, so-so in low light.3.  Features - I like the ability to pan and tilt.  It responds quickly.I also like being able to re-center the image by clicking in the frame.  The [...]address is very nice, and was easy to configure.  Setup of users and passwords was a snap.  I also like the presets for quick navigation to different points in the room.4.  Styling - Not bad.  It's small and light.  Easy to move around if you don't want to mount it.  It looks kinda col.5.  Email and FTP - Nice to have.Cons:1.  No audio -  Not that important to me, but would be nice.2.  No zoom -  Wouldn't expect this at this price point.3.  No motion detection - I haven't tried the heat detection, but would guess that motion detection would work better. But then again, I should test it out.Overall, I am very pleased.

I have mine set to standard (Favor Clarity - Standard - Favor Motion).  My driveway is fifteen to thirty yards from the camera.  I can easily tell what car is driving up.  And the way I have it aimed I can pick up someone on the sidewalk.  It's clear enough that I could easily pick them out of a mugbook.  ;-)  This is not a full-motion camera...15 fps is it's max.  I automatically record thirty seconds before and after the camera detects motion.  That's very handy.  A bright day that has clouds passing by and blocking the sun off and on will set off the motion sensor.

Total time from opening the box to having the wireless completely up and running was less than 20 minutes.The reason I took away half a star was because the images at night are very grainy.  There is a very bright streetlight outside that does illuminate a small area, but the rest of the picture is just too grainy to really see anything clearly (like faces).

It is supposed to work without a static IP address, but doesn't in my case.  We have wireless internet access in this area (not cabled or DSL).  When trying to view the camera, the router for the wireless tower stops you from getting in to see the camera images.  As an alternative, I was told I could create a website and have the camera flip photos via FTP on a regular basis to my website until a static IP address could become available to me.  I went to all the trouble and expense to do so and 5 days later got it all working with a lot of help from my ISP.  Left the state to go back home feeling confident that I could monitor the temps in the house every day.  Only 3 days after I leave, the camera freezes and stops working all together.  I contacted someone at my ISP who uses the same camera regularly for his own website and was told that the camera freezes often and they have to regularly unplug it (at least weekly) to get it to reset and start working again.  Wish they had mentioned that in the first place and I would have not bothered!  Since I am in another state, I am not available to unplug it all the time, so the best I can hope for is a power outage to reset the camera.  Panasonic Support was NOT helpful at all since they were completely shut down for the entire week of New Years for the \"Holiday\".  Well I've got news for them...the Holiday is ONE day not SEVEN.
