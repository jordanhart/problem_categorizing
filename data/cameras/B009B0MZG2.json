{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A small, capable, conservative full-frame DSLR", "Author": "D. Alexander", "ReviewID": "RK1QX7TJ0499O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has top-tier image quality in a polished, compact package well-suited to travel. Those upgrading from a 5D II or 7D may prefer the sharp response and focusing performance of the 5D III. Buyers without an investment in the Canon system may find Nikon's D600 a better value.I've finally had enough of a hands-on with this camera to draw some conclusions about it. My main body is a 5D II and I've owned or used almost all of Canon's crop bodies.HANDLING AND NEW FEATURES:Build quality on first impression is similar to the 60D and 5D II. Solid enough, with a slightly narrower grip than most previous Canon bodies, those two inclusive, but still comfortable to my large hands. This body is petite for full-frame, about 10% smaller by volume than the 5D II and 15% under the 5D III. Weight is similarly svelte, below every 5D and the 7D, and about even with the 60D. The larger cameras will balance a bit better with heavy lenses; this 6D will be the preferable travel body by a small margin.New relative to the 5D II are improved weather sealing and a much-appreciated mode dial lock. It's not clear how comprehensive the sealing is; I still wouldn't take it in the rain, and very few non-L Canon lenses are weatherproof. The LCD screen has a fatter aspect ratio and somewhat better contrast. As seems to be the new Canon norm, the 6D has mushy buttons that activate at some indeterminate point.Novel, however, is the button layout. The top panel retains the 60D's configuration of four buttons, each with one function. The 5D series, 7D, and prior XXD models have three buttons with two functions per. You lose direct adjustment of flash exposure compensation and white balance, but frankly, most people will find this simplified layout preferable. I still forget which dial controls which function on my 5D II. The rear panel looks superficially like the 60D with the same right-hand bias, though the functionality has been shifted around. A mitigating factor is that, as on the 7D, 60D, and subsequent bodies, you can bind custom functions to many buttons. I didn't find it a major trial to adapt from the 5D II, but you'll definitely want to spend a few days with it before you have to work under pressure. Rebel owners will find the adjustment more significant.This 6D has a single SD card slot. The 5D II uses CF, which is rapidly becoming the purview of only high-end bodies. CF is faster, harder to lose, and costs more. SD is fast enough for a body in this speed class. This is nonfactor unless you have a sizeable collection of the opposing format. The 5D III has a dual slot that can speed some workflows and provide media redundancy.Like all Canon full-frame DSLRs, this body doesn't have a popup flash. I'm not lamenting the absence, it was a bone to casual shooters more than a serious tool. Max sync speed for most Canon bodies is around 1/200, so integrated flash only works for outdoor fill with narrow apertures. Indoors as a main light source, the tiny size and close proximity to the lens lead to red eyes and a flat, unflattering high-contrast look. A much preferable setup for any Canon DSLR pairs a 430EX or 580EX, ideally diffused or aimed to bounce off a nearby surface.Shutter lag now rivals the 5D III and 40D-7D, a few ticks quicker than the 5D II and any of the Rebels. This responsiveness bodes well for the first shot. Later shots come at 4.5 fps, a rate ideal for candids, but not for sports. The 5D II and III are respectively worse (3.9 fps) and better (6 fps). Of greater interest: like the 5D III, the 6D now has a 'silent' shooting mode that lowers the volume and pitch of the mirror clunk by half. Every wedding I've ever shot would have benefited from that.The screen interface follows the mold of every Canon body since the 40D. It has a series of horizontal tabs with options. The major UI change is that instead of 9 tabs that also scroll vertically, you get 15 that don't. The advantage is that you can rapidly wheel through tabs and see everything there is to see without scrolling; the disadvantage is that it looks intimidating and there are multiple tab groups of the same icon. The 'Creative' modes show every tab. Some are hidden in Program and Auto modes. We've come full-circle since the original 5D, which had a handful of tabs and piles of scrolling.A major new feature also common to the 5D III is a better implementation of Auto-ISO. It's often the case in changing light where you want to shoot a lens wide open for subject isolation, but with a fixed or minimum shutter speed so you won't risk motion or hand blur. On the 5D II, that was a no-go; Auto-ISO didn't work in Manual mode, and the minimum shutter chosen in the other modes was too low. This camera will do Auto-ISO in M between any lower and upper bound you choose. Or you can set a minimum shutter for Av or P mode. Wonderful and overdue, this.Some other new features are worthy of note. They've added a single-axis level that's useful for landscapes and architecture. The GPS feature will tag images with a location and can also keep a constant breadcrumb position log (at significant cost to battery life) that you can layer on a map later. And they've added wireless networking, so you can control the camera by smartphone or laptop with a live video feed. I can do that with my 5D II, but it requires a cable or USB-wireless converter dongle. In theory, you can also upload to Facebook by way of a Canon bridge website, but I didn't test this.AUTOFOCUS:AF is a marginal improvement over the 5D II. Performance and customizability are somewhat better, but usability suffers.First, context: unlike a phone, point-and-shoot, or mirrorless body, DSLRs don't use the image sensor (\"contrast detect\") to focus for still photography through the viewfinder. That means you don't get face detection or any sort of scene recognition at all. Instead, you've got a handful of 'AF points' in a diamond configuration. Each point covers a tiny area of the frame. If you let the camera choose the point, it'll pick whichever is sitting on a contrasting edge (i.e., a clear dark/light edge; anything that isn't a flat color). Maybe that'll be an eye. It could just as easily be a button. The first major habit to acquire with a DSLR is picking your own focus points. The easier that is, the faster you can accurately shoot.On the 5D II, there's a joystick on the back to individually select any of the 9 AF points with a single click. The phase sensor has 6 invisible AF-assist points to help track motion. Minimum light to focus with the center cross-point is -0.5 EV; in my case, that translated to an exposure of 1/50, f/2, ISO 25600 with a 100/2. Very dim, but not impossible to see and not out of the ISO capacity of this body or certainly the 6D.  Shooting by moonlight or dim exterior lighting could benefit from greater AF sensitivity.The 6D excels in this area. The center point is rated to -3 EV, a full 2.5 stops below the 5D II and is, in theory, at least a stop under any other Canon DSLR. There's essentially no handheld exposure, even with an f/1.4 or f/1.2 lens, for which this camera won't catch focus. But it's missing the 5D II's joystick; you have to awkwardly shift your thumb further down to use a less precise 8-way rocker panel. If you choose not to bind AF to the shutter button, you'll wear out that digit in a hurry. Also, the system now has 11 AF points (with no additional coverage), so you can't directly select the two outer points anymore.As to motion tracking, the 6D's AF diagram suggests it may also have 6 or 8 AF-assist points. The manual doesn't say, and if they exist, they're not selectable. Either way, the same rules from the 5D II apply: if you're tracking a high-contrast object centered in the viewfinder in decent light, it works well enough. All bets are off if you need to rely on the outer points. Likewise for using the outer points with wide-aperture lenses; they don't always hit. You'll want to take a lot of safety shots if focus is critical.There are a few new custom functions to fine-tune AI Servo. As with the 5D II, the 6D supports AF microadjustment, though now with separate settings for the wide and long ends of zoom lenses. Also interesting is the ability to link the AF point with camera orientation; helpful if you're switching from portrait to landscape repeatedly.To the extent it's possible to narrow a wide array of AF characteristics to a 10-point scale, here's how I'd subjectively rate Canon's various bodies:Center point / Outer points / Motion tracking | Body9 / 9 / 9 | 5D III6 / 6 / 7 | 7D6 / 5 / 5 | 40D/50D/60D/T4i/T5i8 / 3 / 4 | 6D6 / 3 / 4 | 5D II6 / 3 / 3 | T2i/T3i/SL1Some scenarios will show greater disparities than these numbers suggest. A 6D in very dim light may well catch focus where every other body on this list fails. Likewise, very fast or erratic objects may flummox every camera here but the 5D III. I've ranked the 5D III's center point higher because, while it can't match the 6D in moonlight, it has significantly higher accuracy and consistency with recent Canon lenses.STILLS IMAGE QUALITY:Excellent. Per-pixel sharpness is very high and superior to crop bodies-- par for the course for a full-frame sensor near this pixel density. Dynamic range is similar to the 5D II and 5D III. Noise performance in raw is a third-stop better than the 5D III, one stop ahead of the 5D II, and a little over 2 stops past the T2i/T3i/60D/7D. I'd run this body to ISO 12,800 without much thought. Colors at low ISO are indistinguishable from any other Canon DSLR.Shadow noise has improved over earlier bodies. A common shooting technique is to meter for highlights and raise the shadows in post to make darker details visible, the manual equivalent of Canon's 'Auto Lighting Optimizer'. Boosting the shadows with a 5D II eventually reveals banding patterns and a blue cast. The 5D III fixes the banding, but retains the color cast. The 6D doesn't have either. While Nikon still holds a narrow lead on this point, 6D files are cleaner than every other Canon body save the 1D X.To get the most out of this DSLR, you'll want to shoot raw. Raw lets you defer decisions (e.g., white balance, sharpening, noise reduction, color, distortion, tone curves, exposure, and so on) that distract from catching whatever moment you're after. Adjustments to raw files in post are vastly more flexible than the Picture Styles that control the 6D's JPEG engine. Those provide only rudimentary adjustments to tone, sharpening, and color.With challenging lighting (mixed white balance, high or low dynamic range, or changing light), Picture Styles can give a suboptimal result, complicated in part by metering. In low-dynamic-range scenarios (e.g., a cloudy day), 'evaluative metering' tends to give a dull, low-contrast picture. With a high DR scene (e.g., a sunny day with deep shadows), blown highlights and clipped shadows will be exacerbated by a high-contrast Picture Style set for the earlier scene.If you're careful configuring the body and the stars align, you can get decent JPEG output and forego work in post, but I consider a fast computer and a photo management system like Adobe Lightroom to be less complements than necessities.LENSES:I want to segue into this section because it's entwined with image quality. Comparing full-frame and crop isn't quite apples to apples. It's much easier to find crop lenses with good edge performance. Canon's current full-frame DSLRs make hash of almost all the mid-range variable-aperture zooms they've released over the years. I was pleased with my 28-135/3.5-5.6 IS on my 40D. Very consistent sharpness across the frame, even wide open. On full-frame, the same lens falls down. Poor edge performance, lots of aberrations.Expect to pay 30-100% more on glass to feed this camera relative to EF-S lenses. Full-frame L glass costs a mint, but most of the third-party wide to mid-focal lenses don't emphasize edge performance. I've used a 14/2.8, 17-40/4, 16-35/2.8 II, 24-105/4, 100/2, and 200/2.8 among others. The latter two are stellar across the frame, as is the Samyang ultrawide. The 24-105/4L, 17-40/4L, and 16-35/2.8L II are merely good. None perform that well in the corners at wide apertures. Older wide-angles like the 17-35/2.8 fare even worse.What should your kit be? Some considerations:* Primes are lighter, smaller, cheaper, often available in wider apertures, often optically better, and have less manufacturing variation. They're less convenient, less versatile, updated with new technologies (e.g., stabilization, better lens coatings, weight reductions, faster or more accurate AF) less often, and can cause you to miss shots in fast-paced shooting environments.* There are different requirements for movie lenses and still lenses. No Canon full-frame zooms are optimal for movies. Some are more optimal than others (e.g., less focus breathing, more parfocal, less distortion, smoother operation, distance scale). Primes often fare better.* An f/2.8 lens on this body is just fast enough for most indoor use without flash. You'll want a flash for anything slower. A flash can provide more even, pleasing pictures, at the expense of a bulkier, attention-attracting rig.* Kits with more than three primary lenses can become unwieldy in use. Two are preferable. My walkaround kit is a 16-35/2.8 and a 100/2, or a 24-105/4 alone if I expect to shoot movies. Professional event shooters tend to rely on the 16-35/2.8, 24-70/2.8, 70-200/2.8, and faster primes like the 85/1.2 as necessary.* Third-party lenses tend to have less upfront cost, better warranties, and more aggressive designs. AF and optical performance is often (but not always) inferior to OEM lenses, quality control is less consistent, and resale values are lower. Value varies by lens model. Some are better than the OEM equivalents (e.g., Tamron 70-300 VC, Sigma 35/1.4). Some fill holes in the OEM lineup (e.g., Sigma 120-300/2.8 OS). And some are lesser substitutes, but still competitive (e.g., Sigma 70-200/2.8 OS, Tamron 70-200/2.8 VC). Third-party lenses that duplicate the OEM with similar performance may not always be preferable to used copies of the OEM model.VIDEO:Out of the box, 6D video has five characteristics: lovely depth-of-field-control with the right lenses, clipped colors, high contrast, about 720p worth of actual detail at the 1080p setting, and issues with aliasing and moir\u00e9 common to most Canon DSLRs. Moir\u00e9 (false coloring and an interference pattern on subjects with repeating fine detail) in particular is more noticeable than with the 5D II and well behind the 5D III.There are a few improvements over the 5D II. Canon has added time code support for better synchronization of events in post and superior on-camera editing controls. We now have 720p/50 and 720p/60 to complement the 1080p/25 and 1080p/30 modes. The compression algorithm is better, as is noise performance, and there's a slightly superior (though still quite slow) contrast-detect focusing algorithm.Unbelievably, Canon still hasn't included focusing aids for manual focus. It's very difficult to judge focus from the LCD screen without overshooting and undershooting. Professionals that have to focus on the fly use a magnifier that sits on top of the LCD or rely on focusing aids in Magic Lantern, a third-party piggyback firmware available for the 5D II (but not yet for the 6D). For that reason alone, video here remains very much a professional feature.In terms of post-processing flexibility, Canon EOS video is like shooting JPEG, but worse because the H.264 video codec throws away even more unseen data. You have none of the lossless adjustability of raw, so it's pivotal to lower contrast to preserve detail in the highlights and shadows, dial back the colors to prevent clipping, and lower sharpening so you can add it back in post without causing nasty artifacts. You do that by setting the correct white balance in advance and by creating or downloading a custom tone curve with low contrast, color, and sharpening. The latter won't affect your stills if you shoot in raw, so you can cater it solely to video.Camera shake is another issue. If you're going to shoot without a tripod or Steadicam rig, get a stabilized lens. In fact, just buy the 24-105/4L IS. No other lens has the combination of size, weight, edge performance, range, stabilization, consistent aperture, speed, and partial parfocal (holding focus through the zoom range) ability.The next best choice might be something like the Tamron 24-70/2.8 VC or Canon's upcoming 24-70/4L IS. Anything over 50mm that isn't stabilized will challenge your ability to record smooth footage. You can fix that later by transcoding to an editable format and using the anti-shake facilities of Adobe Premiere, Sony Vegas, or Virtual Dub with Deshaker, but that's a pain and they all crop the frame. Start with stabilization from the outset and save yourself the bother.Stabilized lenses cause a new problem: the IS system is audible on the audio track. It's obvious with the 70-200/4L IS, noticeable with the 24-105/4L IS, and a background hum with the 70-200/2.8L IS I/II. That's in addition to dial clicks, finger movement, and wind noise, which obscure what would be fairly mediocre sound quality in the best case. The 6D records CD-quality 48 KHz 16-bit stereo tracks; the fault is with the internal monaural mic and amplifier. The simplest, most portable solution is to attach an external battery-powered mic to the flash hotshoe. The two most popular are around $250 from Rode. Zoom's H1 stereo recorder is a cheaper, more versatile alternative that can also be camera-mounted.ACCESSORIES:For video, buy SD cards 32 GB or larger. My pair of 16 GB cards have been inadequate for even a one-day event. Choose SanDisk. I've never had a SanDisk card of any size fail, they maintain higher resale value than other brands, and they tend to write somewhat faster than competitors with the same speed rating.Interface responsiveness isn't much affected by card speed. Faster cards have three advantages: they can shoot longer bursts at 4.5 FPS, clear the picture buffer more quickly, and fulfill Canon's write speed requirement of 20 MB/s to record video at the highest quality. Buffer depth is 17 raw files with a UHS-1 ('Ultra High Speed') SD and 14 with a conventional card. Buffer cycling times are much lower with UHS-1. In one-shot mode, this difference is invisible; very fast cards would only make sense if you were time-limited on card-to-computer transfers with a USB 3.0, SATA, or Firewire card reader.If you buy protection filters for your lenses, try Hoya's \"DMC PRO1 Clear Protector Digital\" line. They have very high light transmission and don't cause visible flare. Digital sensors filter UV natively, there's no reason to pay more for that feature. I've written reviews on the relevant Hoya product pages with more details and why you might (or might not) want a filter.Third-party batteries are hit or miss. The 6D won't read the charge capacity of many LP-E6 copies that worked fine with earlier bodies. STK has a battery chipped specifically for this camera that's worth considering. Compatibility aside, Canon OEM batteries tend to retain more charge capacity for a longer period. Your call whether that's worth five times the price.NIKON D600 VS 6D:(+) Focus tracking(+) Focuses with f/8 lenses vs. f/5.6 (e.g., f/5.6 lens + 1.4X TC)(+) 24 vs 20 MP(+) Shadow noise at low-ISO(+) 5.5 vs 4.5 fps(+) Dual-SD slots(+) DX crop mode(+) Headphone monitoring port(+) Pop-up flash(+) More physical controls(+) Auto-ISO even better(-) No GPS(-) No Wifi(-) Center-point focus in very low light(-) Noise at high-ISO(-) Live View mode more limited(-) Larger, heavier(-) Early copies were prone to accumulating sensor cruftOn balance, while the 6D is a fine evolution of two older bodies (the 5D II and the 60D), the D600 is a simply a tier above in specification. The two brands give and take on the system level; Canon has a better service department and an edge with telephoto zooms and tilt-shift. Nikon has the best wide-angle zoom available on any mount. Consider the cost of your likely kit before judging by body prices.SHOULD YOU BUY A 6D?* If you're new to DSLRs:Yes, with caveats. DSLRs give you lens flexibility, subject isolation, better low-light performance, and potentially superior motion tracking. They're also bulky, expensive, a suboptimal design for video, and inconsistent in the point-and-shoot modes. Mirrorless designs are more compact, easier to use, and better for video, but not as capable for stills or movement. Prosumer single-lens cameras are smaller, much cheaper, and with jack-of-all-trades functionality that less demanding users may find preferable.Relative to crop DSLRs, full-frame bodies like the 6D give you better low-light performance. They cost more, require larger and more expensive lenses, and tend to be somewhat less responsive to fast action outside of the top product tiers.If you've settled on full-frame, the two chief competitors are Canon and Nikon. Canon is a bigger company with a wider, more modern, and more readily available lens line, but it also tends to have more rigid product segmentation that can leave lower camera bodies wanting for some features. If you can swing the cost, both companies produce products capable of almost any photographic endeavor.Among Canon's full-frame line, the choice is between an old new-stock 5D II, 6D, and 5D III. The 5D III is a faster body with extras like dual card slots that professionals appreciate. It also has a dramatically superior AF system for motion tracking and automatic AF point selection. Given that f/2.8 full-frame zoom lenses start at over $1000, the 6D's $800 price advantage over the 5D III on sale isn't enormous in the larger scheme. Something to consider if your subjects move a lot. The 5D II is fine if discounted 20% relative to the 6D; at the same price, I'd take the 6D for the new sensor, silent shutter, and Auto-ISO.* If you have a Canon Rebel DSLR before the T4i:Yes, if you're willing to trade comparatively cheap and small EF-S lenses for stellar noise performance, a bright viewfinder, superior low-light focusing, and a rear control dial, among the 6D's other enhancements.* If you have a Rebel T4i, 60D, or 7D:Same as above, but you're also trading speed and motion tracking, and the 6D doesn't gain as much in usability. A 60D isn't far removed from this 6D in feel. The 7D is a league apart: a league of amphetamines. If you want speed, low noise, and even better AF tracking, the 5D III is your body.* If you have a 5D II:No, if you're shooting predominately raw. There's little functionality in the 6D that can't be added to the 5D II and the bodies are very similar in capability. The exception is very low-light shooting. Moonlight, street-shooting at night, or star trails that benefit from locking onto a faint point source to set infinity will all be easier on a 6D, and the extra noise performance doesn't hurt. You're likely to miss the 5D II's AF joystick.IN SUM:I like this camera body. Stills image quality is extraordinary, and for that purpose, there's little to fault. Taken in isolation, the 6D is an enormously capable and polished photographic instrument, and $600 less than the 5D II was in 2008.The quibbles appear when you consider it in the context of the larger market. It's an expensive camera with many of the same faults and limitations that were laboriously documented in the 5D II four years ago. The competition hasn't been resting on laurels; quality control aside, Nikon's D600 is more capable in many ways and similarly priced. I'd still choose Canon on the strength of the Canon system, but others may find greater value elsewhere.If you intend to downvote, please leave a comment so I can correct the issue.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "6D vs 5D Mark III and Nikon D600", "Author": "E. K. Wlin", "ReviewID": "R2HK3XXFZH8KD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received a 6D as a backup to my 5D Mark III. I am not going to bore you with the specifications that you can Google to find. I know most of you are reading this because you are getting into an entry level full frame camera or go straight to pro. Among your choices are Canon 6D, 5D Mark III and Nikon D800/D600. Since I do not have a D800 around I won't be able to cover it here but you can find lots of other reviews. This review will be done with a side by side comparison of the actual photos.ISO noise comparisonAfter spending the night taking several comparison photos at ISO 3200 F4 1/125, 6400 F4 1/500, 12800 F4 1/250 and 25600 F4 1/1000, here is my conclusion. Photoshop enlarged at 350% shows the 6D has about one stop advantage over the 5D Mark III and 1-1/2 stop over the Nikon D600. That did not come as a surprise since the 6D has the lowest resolution among the 3 DSLR.Update 12/7/2012: When these photos were reviewed in raw, I discovered the 6D filter setting is different, making it looked like it had lower noise. The 6D is in fact only about half stop better in ISO performance than 5D when compared in raw and one stop better than the Nikon D600.Auto Focus5D Mark III is the fastest, then D600 then 6D. They are all very close and hard to tell even in low light condition. All 3 shows remarkable focus speed. 6D occasionally will hunt for split seconds. D600 and 5D both have no hesitation locking in especially the 5D. To compare how fast each focuses, I listened to the motor sound of the lens.Update 11/26/2013: The center focus cross type sensor on the 6D is more accurate and faster than the 5D and the D600. I use this point focus mode almost exclusively in sports photography.Auto White Balance5D Mark III and 6D both have excellent auto white balance under different lighting condition. Nikon D600 however has a greenish or yellowish tone, turning a red rose into orange under fluorescent light. Kelvin level can be corrected of course under Lightroom but it is very difficult to tune it in the camera.View Finder5D Mark III has similar view finder as the 6D and both are brighter than the D600. This makes it a lot easier to focus especially in poor light. This is a big deal for my aging eyes and the brighter view finder is truly helpful on the Canon. I believe this is due to larger mirrors used in the Canons. The 6D does not have the 100% view but since I am not a pro, it really does not bother me.WeightThe 6D is the lightest of the 3 cameras but the 6D does not feel cheap in the hands. There is lots of advantage of being light especially I am going to use it on an Octocopter for aerial videos and photos.Edge sharpness6D clearly leads here. May be Canon has improved the image processing firmware. 5D is not too far from the 6D but beats the D600.ResolutionThere is not much of a difference in the mega pixel of these cameras, at least not enough to tell the difference even on a 24 inch monitor.VideoUpdates 2/24/2013I have compared all 3 cameras extensively in video mode. Most of my videos were aerial filmed from a Turbo Ace hexacopter and octocopter in light wind. So this will be a good test how they performance. First, I found there is no difference on the rolling shutter between the 3 cameras. All DSLR still suffer this problem and this is where some of the cinema cameras such as the Red Scarlet/Epic shine. As for the moire and aliasing the Mark III is the clear winner. I barely notice any moire and aliasing on the roof tops and power lines. If you are going to do video on a more professional level, you should stick with the Mark III unless you invest on a Red or something quite affordable like the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema. I was told by a friend that the Pocket Cinema after color grading, can top the 5D video due to its 13 dynamic range. As for the dynamic range, the D600 excels among the 3 cameras but by a narrow margin. The D600 has about 11.5 stops and the Mark III/6D are at 11 stops. The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema and Red scarlet/Black Magic have 13-14 stops. Red shoots in 4K/2K which makes it more ideal than any DSLR for video. My only problem shooting video with the Red is flight time as it weights about 10 pounds with all gears. If my Octocopter struggles to keep it in the air, imaging what it is going to do to your arms. I can't wait to see the new Turbo Ace CineWing 6 Hexacopter which will carries the 6D with 15 minutes flight time. It is exciting how these multi rotor copters advanced, allowing me to view the world from a different perspective. I will keep you updated on the aerial photo/cinematography technology with some breath taking aerial photos/video.Updates 11/24/2013: The 6D gave me about 2 minutes flight time on the Turbo Ace CineWing 6 Hexacopter. That is a total of 14 minutes in the air to get the shots I need. I could shoot photos with a remote trigger from a mile away. Technology has advanced exponentially from last year. The Hexacopter practically flew itself and the aerial photos were jaw dropping.Updates 12/12/2012:To see the latest video review, go to Youtube and search for \"Canon 6D vs Nikon D600 vs 5D Mark III Hands-On\"Go to[...]To be honest I am quite impressed by the 6D and so far it's a keeper.I have kept a record of the 12 photos with 4 different ISO settings for each of the 3 cameras which I will include in my comprehensive upcoming Youtube review.Updates 12/4/2012: Moire is still best on the Mark III. No DSLR so far comes even close and that includes the 6D. The D600 suffers the same moire syndrome as the other DSLRs. That is disappointing as I was going to shoot lots of video with my Hexacopter Octocopter since it is so light and easy to handle in the air. Now I have to avoid the roof tops.Between the Canons and Nikons, I've got say I am quite fond of the Nikon D600. It has better dynamic range and I missed the built-in flash on both Canons. The D600 truly shines here as it is inconvenient to lug around a full size flash with my Canons. Canon's perspective is the build-in flash is not for a pro level camera but they are so wrong. I use the D600 flash mostly for fill-ins or trigger.My humble view of the dual SD card slots is that it is over hipped. I only use SD in my Mark III and when I absolutely have to have backup in critical shoots I would rather have 2 cameras. The dual cards are confusing unless you are totally organized. It is hard to remember which card and which photos were already loaded to the computer and I have to remember to delete the photos in each card. There is also a bug in the Mark III firmware. If you set the SD as primary and remove it later, shoot some photos with the CF, the camera will no longer recognize your SD as primary when you reinsert it. You will have to manually set it each time otherwise you will be searching for photos in the wrong card. When using dual cards, if your habit is to leave everything in the card for days and not download them to the computer frequently, you will not remember which photos are in which card and which ones are duplicate backups. Also remember, the dual slot does not work under video mode. Many of you here may be more organized and more diligent downloading your photos and will prefer this feature so that is just my personal preference.Updates 11/21/2013: The dual slot is actually comes in very handy but in a very different way. I am using my CF slot to store 2 backup SD inside a small plastic bag to prevent them shorting the circuit. It saved me serveral times when I forgot to put the SD card back or ran out of memory.Infrared sensor. On the 6D and Mark III, the infrared sensor is on the grip and it works quite well taking photos of yourself or using a remote trigger directly in front of the camera. The sensor on the D600 on the other hand is located behind the camera. It is almost impossible to sense remote in front of the camera but it is very convenient if you are behind. The D600 is a great camera for shooting candid photos of animals/people or if you are using a remote shutter trigger behind the camera. IMHO, the camera design should have 2 sensors, one in the back and one in the front. You have to do a lot of remote shutter shots to appreciate this.Dynamic range. The D600 is better in dynamic range than the Mark III and 6D. This is another area the D600 shines. The 6D is sharper but the D600 has more detail in bright and dark area. I believe the 6D sharpness has something to do with the way the images are processed.Grip size. The two Canons fit larger hands than the Nikon D600. I have a medium size hand and the Canon grip fits just right, the D600 grip is too small for the average hands. With a caliper I measured where you clamp the grip between your fingers and your palm and the Mark III is 33.2mm, 6D 31.5mm and D600 28.3mm.The review is based on photos and videos taken with the same manual settings and similar lenses. I tried hard to cover the important points but there are always going to be things that should be added.

First, let me tell you that I upgraded from a Rebel T2i, which I absolutely loved.  I'm by no means a pro, and I don't typically get paid for my work; but I would classify myself as a photo enthusiast.  I travel a lot and size and weight were factors in my decision to go with the 6d.  I also like to shoot with available light, which is why I wanted to go full frame for the high ISO performance.  For some reason it says I purchased the body only, but I actually bought the kit.Let me address some of the \"cons\" that people are complaining about right out of the gate.  I'm going to assume that most people considering the 6d are like me - looking to upgrade from a nice point and shoot style camera or a Rebel series or other APS-C style DSLR.  Nearly everything that people are stating are \"cons\" I never had on my Rebel in the first place, so I don't miss these features.  The AF system has gotten a lot of attention, but on my Rebel, I used the center point 90% of the time for focusing.  The center point on the 6d is just amazing.  It focuses in an almost completely dark room.  Certainly it will be able to focus for any situation when you are going to shoot hand held.  I will take the simplified control of 11 AF points and an absolutely fantastic center focus point over 61 points (caveat: I don't shoot sports or other fast moving objects so I wouldn't really benefit from the addition points for tracking a moving subject).I rarely, if ever, shoot video so not having a headphone jack doesn't bother me in the slightest.  Also, not having a built in flash is no big deal to me either.  I'm going to assume that people looking at this price range for a camera have an external flash and understand the limitations of a built in flash.  I never used the one on my Rebel anyway.  Finally, not having two SD card slots doesn't seem like a big loss to me.  While I think the redundancy of two slots might be nice, I've never had an SD card fail on me and perpetually back up my images anyway.24-105mm f/4 Kit Lens:Honestly this was probably what was holding me back the most about going full frame.  I previously have been using the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS and I have to say that better than 90% of my pictures taken with my T2i were shot using this lens.  While the 17-55 doesn't have a red ring or L in its name, it defiantly can run with the L glass.  I worried that going from a relatively fast 2.8 (EF-S lenses do not fit on the 6d) to an f/4 would be limiting, but I also didn't want to give up IS and the 24-70mm was out of my price range anyway.  Let me say that given the higher ISO performance, I don't really miss the stop I lost going to an f/4 lens.  I actually like having a bit more reach with the 24-105.  I would defiantly have kept my 17-55 f/2.8 if I could have, but I also don't feel limited by the 24-105 f/4.  In the future I plan to get the 16-35 f/2.8 for use alongside the 25-105 f/4.  So in summary, if you are like me and hesitating about giving up your 17-55mm f/2.8 for the 24-105 f/4, don't worry - the kit lens is fantastic and you won't regret going full frame for a second.ISO Performance:Let me sum it up in one word: amazing.  I hate noisy pictures and I'd hesitate to shoot much above ISO 400 with my T2i.  I have no problem shooting at 3200-6400 with the 6d.  I took some shots basically in the dark at 25,600 and they were defiantly usable.  Low light performance is just amazing.  I can't comment on how it compares to other full frame cameras, but I do know there is just no comparison between APS-C sensors and this one.Auto ISO on this camera is awesome.  I never used Auto ISO on my T2i (as I said above I hate noisy images and didn't like the camera constantly trying to push up the ISO).  The Auto ISO on this camera lets you set a minimum shutter speed (great for people, like myself, who rarely use a tripod).  It brings the shutter down to (near) the minimum, and then starts to the boost the ISO.  Additionally (like most SLR's) you can set the maximum and minimum Auto ISO speeds.Autofocus:I touched on this above, but for its limitations, I actually like the AF system.  I shoot mostly still subjects in available light and absolutely love the center AF point and its ability to focus in near dark conditions.  AF is fast and of the few hundred pictures I've taken so far, hasn't missed yet.  I like the simplicity of the 11-point AF system.  I find the 61-point system hard to navigate.  Coming from a Rebel, the AF system is very similar so there was really no learning curve when going to the 6d.Design & Button Layout:The 6d is surprisingly small and light.  It's honestly not much bigger than my T2i, and only slightly heavier.  It defiantly doesn't feel cheap though.  It feels rugged, well built, and substantial in your hand.  It doesn't have the plastic feel that the Rebels do.  It feels like a pro-level camera.  Coming from a Rebel, I felt pretty at home with the button layout.  A few things are in different places (e.g. the mode dial is on the other side to make room for the top LCD screen) but I was adjusted within a day or so.  The mode dial lock is a cool little feature, but I can't say I ever had an issue with the mode dial moving itself on my Rebel.The 8-way rocker is a bit annoying, but still a step above the four way buttons on the Rebel series.  It's also nice to have the wheel on the back to adjust aperture (or shutter speed) in Manual mode, instead of having to press and hold a button and use the main dial on the T2i.  The menu system feels well laid out and everything is pretty easy to find.  Also having two custom spots on the mode dial is a nice addition (people seems to be complaining there are only 2 instead of 3, but let me say that 2 is much better than the zero I had before!).  You can use the custom spots for pretty much anything (I have my set up for exposure bracketing and portraits).  The ISO button location also takes a bit of getting used to when moving from a Rebel to the 6d, but the reassessed button and raised dot make it relatively easy to adjust quickly.  Also you can customize a lot of the button assignments in the custom functions menu.Battery life seems to be pretty good so far.  As expected, using GPS and WiFi considerably shorten the life, but it's certainly still acceptable.  A note about aftermarket batteries: they work, but the camera doesn't play nice with them.  If you put in an aftermarket battery the camera warns you that it isn't a Canon battery and asks if you want to continue.  It also doesn't know how much battery life is remaining.  I'm hoping the aftermarket battery manufacturers will update their batteries soon (Wassabi indicated within a month or two they would be releasing an update).WiFi & GPS:I bought this camera not really thinking I would use either of these features very often, but let me say they are welcome additions.  The WiFi is pretty simple to set up (if you've ever set up a router or even configured your smart phone to connect to WiFi then you shouldn't have any issues).  In less than 20 minutes I tried out connecting to an iPad, Android phone, laptop, and even a uploading directly to Facebook without any issues at all (note that you have to connect to your laptop first to set up Facebook and you have to register with Canon).  Transferring images wirelessly from the 6d to a laptop is surprisingly fast and easy.  Also, viewing images on an iPad wirelessly is easy (**01/07/2013: Canon confirmed to me that no dedicated iPad app is being developed and you must use the iPhone app).  I don't have much to say about GPS, other than it works.  I stepped outside and it acquired a satellite signal pretty fast.  You can view the geotagged information either in the provided Canon Maps application or in Adobe Lightroom.  I think this will be really great when I am traveling. Note that the GPS stays on even when the camera is off (WiFi does not, however).  You can turn off (or at least turn down the frequency) of the \"bread crumb\" feature (which tracks your location at set intervals to plot your path) to save some battery life.**01/06/2013: The 6d only supports 2.4 GHz wireless bands, so if you are running a 5 GHz band router you won't be able to connect.  Note most routers operating in the 5 GHz band also support 2.4 GHz so it may just be a matter of changing some setting on your router.Advanced Shooting Modes:HDR, white balance and exposure bracketing, and multiple exposure modes are all really great features.  I love to shoot HDR and the camera does a pretty decent job of aligning and merging the images when shooting hand held.  I do feel limited in that you can only take three exposures in HDR mode.  I also find it a pain to have to turn off RAW mode in order to turn on HDR.  I actually prefer the exposure bracketing.  You can bracket up to seven shots in 1/3 EV steps (note that if you want to bracket more than the default three shots you have to change a setting in the custom functions menu).The camera contains a lot of features for JPEG shooters (since I shoot mostly RAW I don't use these features often, but they seem nice to have for people who don't use post processing software).  The camera will now do lens profile corrections (fixing distortion, brightness, vignette, etc.) for the lens that is attached.  I always apply this to my photos using Lightroom and it's nice to have in-camera.Summary:In sum, the 6d is a fantastic camera.  I don't at all feel hampered by the so called \"limitations\" pointed out in some of the reviews (lack of pop of flash, only 11 AF points, a single SD card slot, etc.).  If you are upgrading from a Rebel you will love the improved center AF point, high ISO performance, speed, build quality, advanced shooting modes, and WiFi and GPS built in.  I don't feel the need to compare this camera to Nikon's or Canon's other offering, because honestly this is a fantastic camera in its own right.  I was already invested with several lenses in the Canon system, so Nikon was never really a consideration for me.  The choice was really between the 6d and the 5d M3 and given the relatively large cost difference the 6d was the clear choice.  Also if your considering the 5d M2, I think the benefit of five plus years of development has greatly benefited the 6d, and therefore would highly recommend the 6d over the 5d M2 for the sensor and new Digic 5+ processor.Pros:+Awesome low light / high ISO performance+Great center AF point for very low light focusing+WiFi and GPS built in provide awesome flexibility in shooting, especially for travelers+Relatively light and small (for a full frame) without sacrificing solid construction+Very bright and clear viewfinder (especially when compared to the Rebels)+Digic 5+ processor provides great JPEG improvements and fast enough shooting speedCons:-Kit lens is only f/4, and the 24-70 f/2.8 is pricey!-HDR mode is slightly cumbersome to use and disappointing with its three shot exposure limitation-Button layout takes a bit to adjust toPlease feel free to sound off in the comments with questions!", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's a great camera", "Author": "Nathan L. Mccreery Photography", "ReviewID": "R2HIFYAHMEECCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I guess my requirements in a camera are different than anyone else's but here goes.  I have been a working pro for over 30 years and have always used the most basic cameras you could imagine,  Hasselblad and 4x5 Toyo.  Frankly, I don't give a rats rosy red rear end about WiFi, GPS, in camera video etc.  They are beside the point as far as I'm concerned and usually are just things that keep the old Canon vs Nikon thing going.  The only thing I care about is the quality of image coming out of the camera, and I thoroughly object to paying for a camera body that will be out of date in four years that cost more than I paid for my Hasselblad with three lenses.  That said this camera body fits in very nicely with my needs.  Who says it's a consumer or prosumer body?  Are you kidding me?  It's a camera and having the six thousand dollar body or the five hundred dollar body doesn't make you a pro; you do!  Now that I have vented here's what I see.  Image quality is as good as you will get from a digital camera at this time.  The grain and crispness of the image on my 27\" MAC monitor are excellent.  The first time I used the camera it was amazing how quiet it is; very quiet.  There are some things I don't like about the focusing system but that has been the case on every autofocus camera I've ever used.  The camera will not get it right everytime, however it is very fast and quiet in focusing.  I also have a 60D and use it a lot.  The single feature that I see on the 60D that is absent on this body is the articulating screen, but not for the reason most people think.  I do a lot of studio work and one thing I hate is for the client to ask is they can see the raw image, or they try to sneak around the back of the camera to see what's on the monitor.  With the articulating screen I just turn it over and no image appears on the back of the camera.  They just assume it's the way \"professional\" cameras work since their camera has a picture that pops up immediately after it's taken and the question never comes up.  I like this camera a lot; really more than the inevitable comparison camera body; the 5DMkii.  I rented a body for a week to see if I liked it.  After doing nearly 1,000 images with it, this will be the camera body I get.  Very good camera and unless you're going to abuse it I have a very hard time understanding why it is that there is such a kerfuffle about it having a polycarbonate body and not an all metal body.  I don't know about you but if I have to use the camera in the middle of a rain storm or eastern New Mexico dust storm I put a rain coat on it.  If I drop it I expect it not to work so to me the ruggedness, or lack of ruggedness is a silly argument.  This body is definitely the most \"bang for the buck\" if you're in a Canon system.  If you're in a Nikon system you have my deepest sympathies.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from 5Di - best decision ever!", "Author": "T. Masters", "ReviewID": "R2BFLPII8HLP8Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a small studio and shoot mostly families.  I just finished my third shoot with this camera.  I debated over upgrading from the 5D to the comparably priced 5Dii or jumping to the 5Diii.  For costs the 5dII is closer to the 6D but image wise, the 5Diii is closer.  I decided the cost was the biggest factor and I thought the WiFi function would be fun - it turned out to be the best decision.Build wise, the 6D is much lighter, which is great.  Coming from the original 5D model, the image improvements and high ISO is stunning.  For the majority of my business my clients probably won't be able to tell a difference up to 11x14's but for the occasional 20x30 prints, I can tell a difference.  Plus I can crop like crazy the resolution is so amazing.  No need for longer lenses anymore.  I am a semi-pro, locally published photog and always get a kick out of the \"prosumer\", \"enthusiast\" and \"pro\" debates.  The fact is that the images are only as good as the composition and lighting allows and the camera is just a tool.  Don't let folks make you feel bad for choosing this camera over more expensive bodies, the images this produces are amazing.  Worry about your light and your glass.  Some complain about not having dual card slots.  I haven't ever had a body with two card slots except when I briefly shot with a 1Dsii, but it was pretty heavy to lug around for the kind of shoots I do.  When I shoot weddings, I use two bodies and capture all scenes with both bodies and after over 30 weddings haven't ever had an issue, and If and when I do, I should have it covered by shooting with two bodies anyway.I am a center point focus kind of shooter and although this doesn't have the phenomenal focusing capabilities as some of the bigger bodies, it is still incredibly good.  I shoot with almost exclusively \"L\" glass and the focus so far has been near immediate and spot on.  Luckily all my lens tests have been dead accurate and I haven't had to make any adjustments, which you can do with this camera.The auto ISO and white balance is a huge improvement for me.  I shoot in a lot of mixed lighting situations and so far the 6D has performed like a champ.  I have already printed off images at 6400 ISO and they are comparable to what I was doing at 400 on the old 5D.  My f4 24-105 just became my all purpose lens, finally.  I am excited to see how far I can push the ISO and still have marketable images.The WiFi is awesome.  I thought it might be a fun gimmick, but now after three shoots, it is transforming my workflow.  I am having issues with the remote feature working with Windows8, but am pretty sure it is an issue on my end.  However, the WiFi remote on my iPhone and android tablet is a feature that I am thrilled about.  The greatest feature is after my shoot, I connect my camera to the tablet and my clients can scroll through the images and rate them on the spot, even while I am still shooting.  They love it and I love it.  Mommy is over there watching the images as they are taken and by the time I finish shooting, she is ready to order.So far the ONLY thing I wish this camera had was the pc port on the side to connect my camera to my studio lights in the event my wireless trigger fails.  I ordered the Vello hotshoe pc port adapter just in case that happens.There are so many upgrades I am discovering, every day I find something new that thrills me.  There are probably more features that I won't use than I actually will use.  I basically need a good body that takes great images.  So far, I couldn't be happier.Oh yeah, I hear this thing also takes great videos.  Someday I may have to try that out too.In summary, this is a major upgrade for me.  The resolution I get from this body allows me to crop so much, I may not need my f2.8 70-200 IS anymore.  The high ISO performance is going to allow me to use my f4 lenses more and take shots I wasn't able to in the past.  The WiFi is a great tool that I didn't think I would use professionally, but I can already see it improving my sales.  I have nothing bad to say about this camera.  And to think I was about to start checking into Nikon...well played Canon, looks like I will still be around as a customer for a great deal longer.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from a T2i crop to the 6D", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R1MS7DPY7AXP3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a Rebel T2i w/ 18-135.  Here's are my thoughts after taking the camera out on a shoot last night with the 24-105mm L.Ergonomics:Coming from a T2i, one thing that was incredibly difficult to get used to was where the ISO button is located at. It's no longer an isolated button but now a part of a group of 5 other buttons. The buttons are laid out as AF -> Drive -> ISO -> Metering -> LCD light.  On the 5D MK3, the buttons are Metering/White balance -> AF/Drive -> ISO/Exposure -> LCD Light.  The reason this is important is because from an ergonomic perspective, it's normal to just shift your right index finger from the jog wheel straight down to the ISO button and it's the first button right there. On the Canon 6D, I have to move my finger down and shift it over.  I'm getting used to it, but I can't count how many times I've tried to change my ISO and I kept hitting the Metering button and kept taking my eye out of the viewfinder to make sure I didn't change any metering values. Luckily, even if you hit the metering button, settings don't change until you move the jog wheel. So if you're looking through the viewfinder and you hit a button and ISO doesn't show up, then shift your finger left one button. I'm sure this will just take time getting used to.The viewfinder is significantly brighter which was something I never appreciated until using the 6D.In regards to the focal points, the number of focal points seems to make a larger impact on this full frame camera than it did on my crop body (which only had 9 AF points which seemed plenty on the T2i)  That is, all 11 of the focal points are towards the center of the frame and on the full frame it seems like there's a lot of places left \"open\" with no focal points.  In other words, it seems like the focal points only cover about 50% of the viewfinder coverage whereas on my crop body (with only 9) it felt like the focal points covered 75% of the viewfinder.  Does this matter in the real world? I've not yet to run into any problems, and I suppose one could always use live view focus if for whatever reason one needed a much more precise focus than the 11 AF points.The quality of the center AF point however is superb, and I was surprised I was able to get focus in some situations where my crop body failed in low light situations.In regards to low light image quality, I hated using anything ISO 3200 or higher on my crop body. Pictures were usable but often image quality suffered in graininess and I wouldn't use them for anything professional and even ISO 1600 was borderline but acceptable on my T2i. On the 6D however, I am impressed with the images at ISO 6400, and so far pretty good results at ISO 12800 as well. This was actually one of the biggest driving factors in me upgrading from a crop to a full frame, and I can say that the 6D does not disappoint in this regard.The in-camera HDR is pretty effective. I was surprised at how easy it was to take HDR images without a tripod and have them automatically stitch together and still come out looking good.  I am of the mentality that there are certain photos that HDR absolutely adds to a picture, but other times it can distract. The fact that it's so easy to get an HDR picture without a tripod in the field is definitely a plus for me.  Keep in mind though that the HDR function will only be available if you are shooting in JPEG mode, so if you're currently set in RAW you'll have to change that setting before setting up the in camera HDR. Once you're finished with any HDR shots, you'll also have to remember to put your camera back in RAW mode.Another nice feature is that there are different raw sizes. RAW - 20MP @ 5472x3648, RAW(M) - 11MP @ 4104x2736) and RAW(S)- 5MP @ 2736x1824. Exactly what it sounds like, but something I wasn't used to seeing on my T2i which always shot in full-size RAW.  So if I'm just going out not doing anything serious, it's nice to have the option of a smaller file size while still retaining the benefits of a RAW image. Then again, if I'm not doing anything serious, I would probably just use a cell phone camera. Therefore, neither a pro or a con.In regards to the Wifi features, I will say that the remote EOS app (Android and iPhone) is a far better solution than an articulating screen.  When doing self-portraits, it is nice to be able to frame the picture with your phone remotely (remote shooting feature).  After my shoot last night, I connected my phone and stuck the camera in the bag as I walked to my car. It felt a lot nicer reviewing my pictures through my phone (and deleting the ones I didn't like) using a touch interface. This is not necessarily a pro or a con, but it was refreshing and I found it to be a better solution as I could zoom with two fingers, pan, etc. I can also see that having a tablet with a larger screen would be useful in reviewing photos in the field. One other thing to mention is that transferring RAW files is pretty slow wirelessly, and it's probably quicker to just pop out the card and stick it in than it is to turn on the wifi settings in camera and then connect through the app.Overall, I'm very satisfied in the upgrade from a T2i to this 6D and I feel it was the correct choice over the 5D MK3 for the following reasons (in order from greatest to least benefit:Slightly better ISO performance (1/2 stop from what I read) over the MK3 -- This may simply be due to the lower resolution / MP count.Slightly improved (-3EV) center focus (as opposed to the -2.5EV on the MK3)~$900-$1000 dollar price differenceWireless / Remote EOS app. (The MK3 supports this but at the cost of a $500 dollar add-on)The MK3 would be a better choice because:More focal pointsSlightly higher resolutionLocation of the ISO button (just my opinion)Dual Card slots (although for me this has zero purpose.)Faster FPS (also has zero purpose cause if I ever need to 'machine gun' my camera 4.5 FPS a second is still plenty fast on the 6D)Update: Canon has released a statement saying that they will allow the center point of the 5Dmk3 to autofocus at F/8 with a firmware update in April of 2013.  That opens up a lot of cheaper lens solutions (100-400L 4-5.6) to be used with a 1.4TC to have a max reach of 580mm while retaining autofocus at f/8.  This may have been a bigger decision point had I had known about this before purchasing the 6D. However, to the 6D's support, you can swap out the standard focusing screen with an EF-S focusing screen for manual focus.  There's also live view focusing, so it's not really a dealbreaker.Update: 1/1/2013Couple of additional thoughts as I've had this camera. The EOS Remote shooting app for Android and iOS is really a great thing to have on a camera.  I just got back from vacation with family and friends and as soon as I took a family photo (some were of people who I didn't know) I was able to ask them for their phone or email address and immediately send it to them.  Almost like a modern day Polaroid. I also was able to get impromptu shots of me with my friends by setting the camera on my camera bag and doing the framing with the three of us sitting in front of a fireplace.I've also thought about the lack of dual card slots a bit more, and I think that if you're going to earn money off your camera it might be better to get the 5D MK3 just in case you happen to have a card failure while shooting a wedding or other one time events that you can't reshoot. It's nice to have the extra insurance, but that's about all it gives you.  Granted, I doubt a card failure would happen during an important shoot, but it's possible and could prevent you from delivering a product.  I think if you're team photographing that this camera supplements a 5dmk3 well, but I like the extra insurance of having backups *just* in case a card failure were to happen as a single shooter. Certainly not a deal breaker by any means, but just food for thought.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quiet Simple, Efficent Tool...", "Author": "thomas", "ReviewID": "R2ZO04YKTBQ6QO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have waited for this camera since September 2012 and it has met and exceeded my expectations.I bought it directly from an Amazon vendor because they gave a free Lowepro bag and 32GB SDHC card with the purchase.  I have used (rented for weeks) the 5D Mk2 and own a 5D Mk3 and the 6D is a better camera than the 5D Mk2.  The 5D Mk3 is a $900 better camera than the 6D.  If I had the 5D Mk2 I would keep it as a secondary and get the 6D as my primary.  For now I leave my 5D Mk3 in the bag and pull out the 6D every time for the last 30 days because it's so simple and fun to work with.The 6D is very light, simple to use and the photo quality is exceptional for this price point.  It makes my slow lenses faster and my fast lenses very fast.  This cameras ISO 2,000-4,000 to the eye is nearly the equivalent of ISO 600-1,200 on older digital cameras which will make it much easier to stop down and work well in low light with depth.  If you pixel peep, higher ISO's (+8,000) are mildly noisy (to my eye) but the Digic 5+ does a decent job managing things.  I actually carry less equipment because the 6D is so versatile and flexible.  It could be considered (in some circles) an entry level camera because it's design is simple but camera function and quality of properly exposed images are impressive.  I find this to be a very easy digital camera to pick up and use, even in the dark.  Menu access and adjustments are simple and most can be done with 1 hand.  Something else of note with this camera is that in RAW, even if you over or under expose a shot, when you go to edit the photo the details are still there to correct unlike many older digital cameras when you over expose and attempt to fix the photo file the details are gone or when you underexpose and try to lighten the noise increases....the files from the 6D are so heavy with info you will more easily save poorly exposed images.  My 1Ds was terrible with overexposure.After considerable use im not as happy with the Auto Picture Style and Scene Intelligent Auto (A+) jpg limitations as I was initially.  My workaround has been to convert to tif before any editing.  In silent mode this camera is so quiet, people posing don't know when I have snapped the photo and often, I have already taken the shot or 3 or 4 shots unheard from 15 feet away.  It is definitely stealthy.  If there is conversation going on in the room the camera will not be heard in silent mode.Wi-Fi is functional and easy to use if you understand basic Wi-Fi principles but my primary concern is image quality and it comes close to the 5D Mk3 and for nearly $900 less I feel that got my money's worth.I think the professional and the novice will enjoy using this camera.  It's an excellent tool to learn and grow with or to jump right in and make money for the professional.Im a freelance photographer and I most often shoot events, concerts (low light) and single subject portrait work.  I don't miss the on board flash.  The SD card versus the CF card or dual cards is a non issue for me.  My primary concern is image quality.  Ease of use is a bonus.  I don't shoot video very often as of yet but it seems adequate.I have 2,981 shutter actuations (at least 2,950 actual photo taken) on this camera as of January 9, 2013If you want a 5D Mk3 this is not an alternative though it comes close in many ways.  If your primary concern is to save money and you are a good shooter get the 5D Mk2 but you will get what you pay for.  If you are moving up from a cropped sensor camera, experienced or new to photography you will be impressed with this camera and satisfied with your purchase.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera", "Author": "SEN", "ReviewID": "RT9JMUZ0268DE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The image quality and high ISO performance from this camera will blow you away. My first impression was that it is a full 2 stops better than my 7D; to be conservative, I will say a stop and a half. Other reviewers have put this sensor at roughly equal to the 5DMK3. I am not sure how it compares to the 1DX, but the fact that we can even ask that question tell you how good this camera is. (The 1DX costs 3 times as much.)At the highest ISO settings, the 6D will take images of things I can barely see. They will not be \"fine art\" quality, but if you think that Bigfoot is throwing rocks at your cabin in the middle of the night, this camera could make you famous. In slightly brighter conditions, this allows you to use a faster shutter and/or smaller aperture to get the same exposure. Most of the best shots, indoor or out, happen in less than \"daylight\" conditions.The controls on this camera are simpler and easier to use than the 7D, without giving anything up. (Who really needs a dedicated picture style button?) I also like the locking mode dial, having ruined a number of pictures over the years by brushing this dial on my coat, gloves, camera bag, etc.The built-in GPS is a cool feature, but you should know that it uses power even when the camera is off. My battery went from 97% to 70% overnight, with the switch turned off.I was a little disappointed with the autofocus screen, not so much because of the number of focus points, but their arrangement. I would like to see them extend closer to the edges and corners of the frame, rather than clustering in the center. To be fair, this arrangement is pretty much standard. The 6D is  very similar to the 5Dmk2, but with greater low-light sensitivity.This camera is offered with the 24-105L as the kit lens.  This is one of the most popular and highly-rated lenses of all time, and in the kit it is real bargain.For me, the 6D is a good complement to the 7D. The 7D has a terrific AF system and gives greater reach to a telephoto lens, while the 6D provides more wide-angle options and superb low-light capability. The 6D is marketed as an \"entry level\" full frame camera, but I know that many pros are MORE concerned than some enthusiasts about getting a return on their camera dollar. I predict that you will see a lot of pros (who aren't shooting sports) look very closely at this camera.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Game changer...", "Author": "Wendy & Jeff S", "ReviewID": "RW0JIKS2UUDS9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I remember the first time I used the original Canon Rebel. That glorious feeling of going from a digital point-and-shoot to a real SLR... the feel of the body, the satisfying ka-click of a real shutter, the depth of field, the control... I was hooked immediately.After later evolving to a 40D and then to a 60D, I never thought I would have that \"oh wow\" feeling again until I took a wild chance and spoiled myself. The 6D arrived, and from the moment I looked through that big, bright (and wide!) optical viewfinder, and experienced the amazing flick of the new \"silent\" shutter, as good as the 60D was, I felt I had jumped to a whole new level. I was not anticipating the new shutter - it's amazing - soft and quiet and very professional with very low volume and vibration. The feel of this thing is like the first time you throw a perfect shifter in a high-end sports car, or slip your arm around a beautiful woman. Okay, maybe that's a bit too poetic... but trust me, you'll find yourself wanting to pull out this baby and flick off a new photo every chance you get.And that was just the start...I turned on the GPS (indoors) and took a few photos a minute later - downloaded them into Lightroom - and LR showed me a satellite view of my house, right down to the corner of the house in which I took the photos! I could not believe how accurate, and how quickly it acquired its location.I haven't used it extensively, but the built-in wi-fi capabilities are pretty amazing too. View images and control your camera remotely from a smartphone or tablet. It transmits a live picture to your device (in my case, a Galaxy Android tablet) and let's you make a few adjustments remotely. It would be nice if it gave you a little more control though. You can also put it into DLNA mode to share with other devices on your network. Once I turned it on, my Playstation3 instantly saw the camera and allowed me to surf through the photos that were still on the camera on my lap. Pretty neat. I wish the UI guys had spent a little more time on the wifi profile menus - they are a lot less intuitive than the other settings. But it works well.I am amazed at the high-ISO performance and it's noise reducing DIGIC 5 processor!You can push it to ridiculous heights before it becomes obvious at anything but pixel-peeking levels. Even the 50,000 and 100,000 ISO range, while obviously noisy, are an acceptable \"better than not getting the shot at all\", and anything up to 3200 is barely noticeable unless you pixel peek. EVen images shot at 12,500 look pretty good once passed through the noise and color filter in Lightroom. In normal ISO ranges, colors are exceptionally vibrant and solid.The HDR feature is nice, but gives a bit more muted, low-contrast look than I usually achieve doing it manually with Photomatix. I'm not sure I would depend on it for taking realistic photos, but I look forward to really putting it through its paces soon. [UPDATE: I was too kind. The HDR feature is pretty much worthless in my opinion. It just doesn't do very good job. I've quit using it.]I went to a large local photography club the day after I bought it and they were showing off how you could buy a GPS accessory for their 7D for \"only\" a few hundred dollars, or a wifi/tablet app for a couple of hundred dollars more, and they had all these doo-hickeys hanging off their camera, and there I was, holding this little marvel with all of this built right in, and for a price that, while certainly not inexpensive, is a bargain within the category of full-frame cameras.Naturally, if you're not aware, as a full-frame camera, the field of view is much wider. That nice, inexpensive f2.8 Canon 40mm pancake lens now becomes a real joy to use with this camera. I splurged and got the kit with the 24-105L lens, which seems to be a wonderful lens, but I will withhold my full review of the lens until I get more time in the field with it*.There is no built-in flash, which does not bother me as I hate the harsh on-board flash, and with the low-light capabilities of this camera, it becomes even less necessary. Of course you can still use a Speedlite.If you have anything prior to the 60D, you will love this upgrade. And if you can spare the cash, it's even a big step up from the 60D as well.This thing is a game changer.Don't skip paying the rent or buying food for your children to buy one, but it's well worth skipping a few luxury items and pampering yourself with this exceptional piece of technology.* Update: still adore this camera, but I've got good news/bad news regarding the lens. I spent hours doing side-by-side pixel-peeking comparisons between this expensive (24-105L) kit lens, and the much cheaper 28-135 kit lens that came with my 40D - a lens I always considered an \"average\" quality lens. You can easily spend 3 times more for the L series 24-105, yet when I compared identical images side by side I found very little to justify the fancy new lens. The build quality and styling is definitely better, and the lens zoom doesn't creep on you when you angle the camera downwards, and if focused perfectly, the L has a little better edge sharpness, but this full-frame sensor on the 6D really brought the old 28-135 to life - the majority of the frame was even sharper, and with better contrast than the L! I would have thought that a full-frame camera would magnify the deficiencies of the cheaper lens, but it really took fantastically detailed images. I have no explanation. I have no real complaints about the 24-105L, other than I was utterly disappointed that it did not stomp on its much cheaper little brother. So... nice lens, but this camera made the old lens pretty nice too. It would be tough to justify buying this lens again.

I received the Canon 6D today and am absolutely in love with it.  I'll spare the superlatives on the obvious, e.g., low light capabilities, image quality. I expected that. The written about shortcomings - AF, lack of a spare card, lack of a swivel screen, no built-in flash to me were all brilliantly designed to keep the camera small, light and relatively low cost.AF - I much prefer that the single cross type AF point works well than have a bunch that are mediocre and the one in the 6D is super fast at extremely low light.  (I shot with the Nikon D300s, known for its AF for a couple years and stopped using tracking with continuous shooting after a month because only a 2 out 6 shots were in focus.)Single memory card - yeah, two is better than one but the space/weight saved makes sense for the overall goal of keeping the camera small and light. Wonder if wifi could be used to backup almost real-time somewhere?No swivel screen - are you serious? a smartphone or tablet connected to the camera via wifi is 1000 times better than a swivel screen. This design is sturdier, cleaner looking, easier to weather proof and way more of an enabler for creative ideas, e.g., limitless vantage points!  The counter from D600 users is that you can buy a wifi adapter for however much but that is a bulkier and less elegant of a design.No buit-in flash - my guess is if you're the type that appreciates the image quality of a FF camera, you'd appreciate the benefits of an external flash. I appreciate the weight and size of the camera every single time I use it, while I am disappointed 1% of the time for not having a built-in flash. I'll take that trade off.Couple things I haven't seen written about too much, 1) the layout and design of the quick menu was extremely well implemented (been using the fuji x100 for awhile and was worried a DSLR would seem clumsy without the dials but the Q menu mitigated that), 2) the silent shutter is a pleasure to use (can't describe it but it gives you a feeling that every aspect of the shooting experience was well thought out.).A bunch of other positive things written about by other reviewers I find to be true as well.

In part because of the absolute ruggedness of the 7D, but also for some of the photographic features it has (8 fps, 19 cross-type autofocus points, etc.). I felt like I would lose a lot of features just for the full frame sensor.Things I don't like about the 6D:1. Very basic autofocus (I don't understand canon on this, this is a rebel AF in my opinion except for the center point)2. Lack of joystick to move autofocus point3. Button layout. I liked some of the buttons on the left like the 7d or 5DIII.4. Plastic camera top5. Plastic LCD screen cover6. 1/4000 sec max shutter speed7. SD card instead of CFMy style of photography is mostly people and some wide-angle as well. It is obvious that the 7D was designed for sports/wildlife photographers. My only major complain about the 7D is the poor ISO performance typical of APS-C sensor cameras, so I went for it and got the 6D.After a few weeks of using the 6D I think I made the best decision I ever made.Although the 7D focusing system seems superior, in practice I've seen that in my work this makes little to no difference.I can say that the IQ and ISO performance of the 6D is FAR superior to the 7D. Plus the depth of field and reclaiming my wide-angle is something that not a lot of us think it's important until you see it in a full frame camera.The 6D is slightly smaller and lighter than the 7D, but I see this as a good thing.The Wi-Fi is very useful and fun to use.I don't think I'm going to use the HDR and GPS functions, but it's good to know they are there.Fortunately I do have some Canon L glass and I've always regarded these lenses because they produce great pictures, but the combination of L glass and FF sensor is something entirely different and superb.My recommendation is ... if you have a 7D, and are thinking about a 6D and your style of photography fits a full frame camera, go for it!

I contemplated this purchase for awhile before actually pulling the trigger.  I went by a local camera shop, played with the 6D and then started doing some research.  From my perspective here is what I thought, keeping in mind I do not make any income from my photography - I do it strictly as a hobby - but I want to take quality pics since I'm a techie.  Also to note, with the 7D II (guessing at the name at this point) around the corner I figured now would be a good time to sell the 7D before values dropped.Pluses:Image quality is absolutely incredible - drop dead gorgeous. In comparison to the 7D (I was using the Tamron 28-75 2.8 & Canon 50mm 1.8) I can honestly say the kit 6D 24-105L is a winner.  Now putting the same 50mm 1.8 on the 6D it improves on the image quality and I also get a deeper DoF.  The full frame sensor here is a winner.Low-light ability- not much more to say other than WOW!  I was hesitant anytime I thought of going over ISO 1600 in the 7D, where the 6D is pretty much wide open - I have no worries using 6400 or higher.  This allows me to get great low-light shots of the kids without busting out the flash.  Combining this with a fast lens, and I'm thrilled!  this leads to the next point sort of...Autofocus ability - a lot of people are going to complain Canon took a step backwards with the 6D's af system and just by glancing at the stats you would think so (ie 7D's19 cross type points vs 11 on 6D and only the center being cross type). HOWEVER - that one cross point is one of the most sensitive Canon has designed, even better than the 5d3 in low light.  So for my use - mainly focusing w/ center point and recomposing - this is perfect and it also ties in to the above point - the low-light ability of this camera.Quiet - the shutter in silent mode is VERY quiet...excellent for sleeping babies!Size - Honestly I thought this was going to be a con - not as ruggedly build as the 7D, not as hefty etc etc - but after having this camera for a month or so now, its a definite plus!  Its a lot easier to carry around for long periods of time since its lighter and a tad smaller.Wifi / GPS / in camera HDR - So these were features that tied into my techie-ness and while not necessarily a purchasing decision, made the decision easier because the 6D had them.  Using the wifi to my phone to trigger pics is cool, and transfering photos instantly to email or social networks is neat too.  We went to a local theme park, I was able to upload a family pic to facebook within minutes of taking it and not having to leave the park! In camera HDR is limited to JPG, so not ideal but again not a selling point - just cool feature to play with.  GPS does eat the battery up, but its easy enough to turn off, even easier when added to the custom \"my menu\"Cons:FPS - yep lost some speed here, 8fps to 4.5fps.  However, I was rarely using the full speed abilities of the 7D so for my use its not a big loss.Loss of reach - the FOV of the 1.6x crop makes a 200mm appear as a 320mm...So now my 200mm is 200mm FOV - I lost some reach.  However on the flipside, I gained some wide angle, which is more along what I shoot anyways.Lack of other cross-type A/F points - covered above, but worth considering - you have to evaluate what you shoot, but for me again not a big deal.Overall I'm very happy with my decision to purchase the 6D over the 7D for what I shoot.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "6D great camera with minor downsides", "Author": "Julius Caesar \"Jules\"", "ReviewID": "R2IVQDKOHJ9IL4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera around 6 months now so I decided to write the review. In my mind you can't really write a review after owning the camera for a day or even a week. I have thoroughly tested this camera as a semi-pro photographer. I have taken just over 10,000 pictures with it. I have used it for many professional gigs included food photography, studio portraits, fashion and interior/architectural. I have used it for leisure on family trips and urban hiking.If you want technical stuff there are a million websites that go over the specs of this camera with a fine tooth comb. This is a great camera! It takes great photos that can compete with any of the pro level cameras on image quality (IQ). This camera is light too which is a plus. When purchasing this camera I could have cared less about the wifi and gps. Upon owning the camera I can say that I actually like and use both features more often that I thought I would. The wifi is great for self portraits and setting up the camera and walking away from it. You can also change aperture, shutter speed and ISO right from the app which is nice. Another great feature is handing my iPad to a really picky client so we can discuss the photos as they are shot. I usually would never offer this or let anyone see the photos before I put my own touches to them, but sometimes, with some clients, it is easier to just give them the iPad and let them have some input. I'm in the business of making my clients happy and this is one\u2014albeit rare\u2014option that I have and can use with the very picky and demanding clients.I use the gps sometimes. It's certainly a feature I could live without, but I do use it and like it. If they put this option in at the expense of something else I would say take it out. I'm not sure what, if any, sacrifices they had to make to put gps in the camera, but it isn't a feature that I find useful enough to actually want. With that being said, it is really cool to take on a walk-a-bout on vacation or on a hike and see the path that you took and exactly where the pictures were taken. The gps isn't pinpoint accurate indoors, but it is mostly accurate when outside. It does seem to take a while to get a signal locked on. I think you can use your phones gps too if you want. I haven't used that feature, I do think I remember reading that you can do it though.The video quality on this camera is good. I know a lot of people tsk, tsk the moire patterns, but all of the DSLRs have these, the 5d Mrk iii to a lesser extent, but this camera is made for stills not video, as is the 5d mrk iii. All of the DSLRs have the rolling shutter effect too. The 6D performs admirably with video. If you want this for professional video you should buy a camera made for professional video, if you want a still camera that will take great video this camera is rock solid. The video is mildly worse than the 5d, but c'mon the 5d also costs a lot more.I love this camera! The autofocus is great, the low light (high ISO) performance is great, and the IQ is great! I give it 4 stars mainly for the max shutter sync only being 180, which isn't bad, but I would have really like the standard 200 at least. Also a joystick would have been nice. I don't mind the 11 AF points, but I wish they were more spread out across the frame. All of the AF points work very well, but in really low contrast, low light situations you have to rely on the center point, otherwise the outer points are very good in normal use. I don't have many complaints about this camera. For the price that they are offering this camera they chose to make some sacrifices and I don't mind the ones that they made. I purchased the 6D because I really need a FF camera and the lowlight capabilities. I was getting hired more often for photography and I needed a camera that could perform... and this camera does! I took that extra money I saved from buying the 5d and purchased a decent lighting system and the 70-200 f2.8 non-IS. The 6ds photos are indistinguishable from the 5ds as far as IQ. Maybe even a little better at high ISO.I'm not sure how this compares (hands on) with any of Nikons cameras and I truly don't care. I did a lot of research before buying the 6D and I almost went with the D600. I had a couple of canon lenses that I liked and that really was the tie-breaker along with the 6Ds lowlight performance. Now that I have the 6D I'm focused on making the most out of the camera I have and for my purposes this camera is everything that I need it to be and more. No camera is perfect and photography doesn't rely on any specific camera. I could jump to a Nikon system right now if I were given the opportunity and I would try and get the most out of that camera. In the end I want the camera out of the the way. I just want great photographs. The 6d is aiding me on that mission. I have real world experience with this camera and it definitely has some minor drawbacks that may even be deal breakers to some. Overall this camera should make most people very happy.

I've previously used the original 5D, 5DmkII, 5DmkIII, 60D, 7D, 1DmkIIN, 1DmkIII and the EOS M, while working part-time for a Canon dealer in Wyoming as a side job to my position on the staff of the Casper Star-Tribune, where I worked full time.I've also used Nikon gear when I work for a paper in Indiana. There I was outfitted with two Nikon D3s's.The Canon 6D features fantastic video, I'd say comparable to the 60D or even the 5DmkII, depending on the lighting conditions. It also boasts a faster frame rate than the 5DmkII, which makes it much easier to use when shooting sports. The ISO range is superb. Images shot at 10,000 ISO, in relatively low light conditions at many of the high school gyms I've shot at recently, look crisp. Much better than anything I've seen from bodies older than the 5DmkIII. And of course, the full frame sensor is a great plus for this body's price point.If you're a journalist or photojournalist, you understand that getting images in as quickly as possible at the highest quality possible can make or a break a story at times. Routinely at spot or breaking news scenes we've had to rely on our iPhones to get any sort of photo transmitted quickly. Hands down the best feature of this camera is the built in wifi connectivity with the Canon iPhone app. I can take a photo at a scene, view images on my card on my phone (or even remotely control the camera with my phone, great for mounted shots in basketball) and pull the image off and transmit something of infinitely higher quality than my iPhone can produce in a matter of a minute.The only drawbacks this body has is the lacking number of autofocus points compared to other bodies in it's capability range, and it's limited shutter speed of 1/4000. That hasn't effected me yet, as usually I can just drop the ISO lower and compensate, but it is a curious limit.  I've also noticed, when trying to shoot basketball in poorly lit gyms (i.e. at a high ISO and under fluorescent lighting) the video the 6D produces has a purple banding to it. I sent my body to Canon thinking it was an issue and they said they simply \"adjusted the imagining array\" and that would alleviate the issue. I'm still noticing it, but again, only at very high ISO and under fluorescent light.For the cost, this is definitely a body I would recommend to any photographer looking for high quality stills, and strong video.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from 7D", "Author": "Tom Raftery", "ReviewID": "R2A0FUHK81L8L6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my 7D shortly after it came out, and I loved it.

I'm a professional digital matte painter in the movie industry.  I spend a lot of time shooting reference images of landscapes and architecture from unique locations throughout the US and the world.After trying each camera at a local shop, I decided to narrow down my options to the Canon 6D and Nikon D600.  I'm not loyal to either brand.  My main priorities for a full frame is image quality and handling.  I even downloaded RAW samples and compared them in Photoshop.Here's some key factors that went into my decision:=====================================================================Canon 6DPROS:*Dynamic Range is greatThe whole DXO mark of the Nikon D600 having 2 more stops is over-hyped!  If you shoot RAW, you have plenty of room to bring back details in the shadows and highlights. If you know how to use Photoshop and camera RAW, this is not a big factor.*Great High ISO performanceImages hold up great in low light situations.  Handheld Night Scene works great!  It shoots 4 bracketed exposures and combines them in-camera.  The result is a very well exposed jpeg image. Main limitation of this that it saves a jpeg image only.  I shoot mainly RAW.  A workaround I end up doing is shooting my usual RAW images and then switch to Handheld Night Scene to get a nice jpeg.  Then I have the best of both worlds.*Very accurate color rendition.What you see in real life is what you get from the photos.*Ergonomics are great I have fairly small hands and the camera fits like a glove. It feels solid and well balanced.*The GPS and Wi-fi are amazing!Here's where Canon really stepped up their game. The directions aren't the clearest on how to set it up, but I figured it out through some trial and error. GPS:  It takes about 1-2 minutes to locate and lock on a satellite signal.  Every time you shoot, the global coordinates of the camera are embedded into the RAW or jpeg file. So after a days work, I can see where each image was taken.  The Canon 6D comes with a map utility software to view this.  Better yet, if you have Adobe Lightroom(highly recommended),  the program has a dedicated \"Map\" tab.  It uses Google maps, so you can navigate and zoom to each location you shot. Now I never have to name my files with long descriptions like \"DTLA_CornerOfSpringSt&6thSt_Noon_3-14-2013.jpeg\" just so I can remember where I was. Wi-Fi: Works great!  Essentially, the Canon 6D acts like a wireless router.  Once you activate it, you can search for the camera on your smart phone. Make sure you install the free EOS Utility app for your phone. Once you connect, your smart phone acts like a live viewfinder and remote control, with the ability to adjust basic settings.  ie, shutter speed, iso, focusing points.*Nice viewfinderVery sharp and bright in reference to what I'm actually seeing.  The whole 97% vs 100% viewfinder coverage is not a factor at all. So what if i don't see 3% of the image through the viewfinder. In the end, that just means you get an extra 3% of the image you didn't see after you view it on your computer. I end up cropping a lot in Photoshop anyhow.*Very convenient and smart button layouts.I can easily change my iso speed and aperture settings without any thinking.  Nice integration of the rear dial to change apertures and make quick adjustments on the fly.*Weather sealedCanon finally decided to address their fogging issue that plagued the previous 5D ii.  Now I have some assurance that  the camera can handle some adverse weather conditions.*Very silent shutter soundA nice addition when shooting with a tour or in a cathedral/sacred place.CONS*No flash pop up.  The high ISO performance makes up for this though.*20 megapixels vs the 24 megapixels on the D600.  Not a big difference, but a small detail nonetheless*1 card slotOriginally this bothered me.  But then I thought, why can't I just carry a tiny SD card in my pocket as a backup.*11 auto focus pointsCanon dropped the ball on this one.  But I do not shoot sports and weddings, so it does not affect my shooting experience.  I've been content with the 11 it provides, plenty for me to adjust my focus areas.*12 stops dynamic range vs 14 stops on the D600. If you shoot RAW, this is not a deal breaker*Some special modes, ie Scene Handheld and HDR, can only be saved as jpeg.=====================================================================Nikon D600PROS:*Slightly better Dynamic Range than the Canon 6DI spent a long time testing out the RAW images but did not see a significant advantage.  If you know how to bracket exposures, then both cameras are on par.*Great ergonomics.I really enjoyed holding the D600, much better than the Nikon D800 in my opinion.  The thumb rest was more pronounced on the D600.  So it felt more secure in my hands.*Nice color rendition*39 focus pointsIf I was shooting sports and weddings, this would be a better addition than the Canon 6D.  Then again if I was shooting these types of subjects, I would upgrade to the Nikon D800 or Canon 5D iii.*Dual card slots*Weather sealedCONS*Viewfinder is a bit small and 1-2 stops dark.I rarely use the live view when shooting.  So I rely on the viewfinder to compose my subject matter.  I'm not sure why Nikon decided to darken it, it really makes shooting in low light situations harder to see.  The Canon 6D, 5D iii and the Nikon D800 does not have this problem.*The dreaded dust/oil problem is not gonna go away for a while. Google it and feel the frustration of Niko That's what you get for trying to save production costs by manufacturing it in Thailand.  It should be made in Japan or the USA !!  To make matters worse, Nikon denied the dust issue for months.*Button layout needs to be simplified and  thought out betterThe dual ring knob at the top is a bit of pain to use.  The iso button is a tiny button located in a the bottom left, not the best location since you have to fiddle around to look for it.  The better Nikon models made sure the iso button is easily accessible using your shooting hand.*Based off of user reviews on Amazon, the extra wi-fi attachment you can purchase seems buggy.*HDR mode only saves jpegs.Like the Canon 6D, you cannot save out RAW image using special modes.*Shutter is significantly louder than the Canon 6D=====================================================================In the end, I stuck with my instincts and went with the Canon 6D.  Despite some features that it lacked, ie dual card slots, I felt this was the best camera for my profession.  Especially with the GPS and high ISO noise performance.I think it's really up to you to decide what you mainly use this camera for and then draw up a list of Pros and Cons. Make sure you visit your local camera shop to test it out for yourself.

I am charging the battery right now, but I had to pop it in for a few test shots just to see how it works in low light situations.  I am in a room with only one tiny lamp on and I have been able to catch focus with all 11 focus points and the images are sharp.  I will note that the center point does find focus the fastest and in very LITTLE light!I will write more as I explore it, but right now its already better in low light than the 5dmkii!  I was debating between a 7D, 5dmkii or another 6D for a backup..... after tonight I am leaning very much towards a 2nd 6D as a backup!  But i do like the extra reach that the 7D would provide and the insane ruggedness of it.The only issue is that I have 3 CF cards that wouldn't be used.  But i do have 2x 32GB SD cards and 1x 16GB SD card that will work for the time being.  I liked the fast focusing of the 7D but in all honesty I wasn't all that impressed with its low lighting quality....which was better on the 5dmkii.  The fact that the 6D can go to even higher ISO's with little noise is going to come in very handy.The kit lens is great as well... with the IS, i can hand hold in almost no light with no flash.My main items are portraits, walk around and landscape.in my bag I have a 6D, (6D, 7D or 5Dmkii as a backup), 17-40L F4, 24-105L F4 IS, 50 F1.4, 85 F1.8, and 70-200L F4 IS, 2x 430exii speedlights::EDIT 1/6/2013::I have played around with the wifi and the EOS ap on my iPhone...

Take it from someone who has lost hundreds of dollars buying a 5DIII, then selling it for a 6D, and then selling the 6D for a 5DIII again after realizing that I actually need the superior AF system of the 5DIII.Basically, if you are trying decide between the 5DIII or 6D and you don't mind using the center AF point for the majority of your photography, go with the 6D and use the hundreds of dollars saved to purchase good glass if you don't already have some, such as the 24-70 or 70-200 f/2.8L II. If you plan on using the outer AF points instead of just the center one (especially for fast glass, like the 85 f/1.2L II), then don't make the same mistake I did...just buy the 5DIII and you shouldn't have any regrets. However, the image quality differences between the two are negligible at best, so it really comes down to the static features (or lack thereof) that they offer and your particular needs:5DIII - more robust body, superior AF system, faster X-sync speed, dual card slots, RAW video w/ Magic Lantern, etc.6D - smaller and lighter body, center cross-type AF point sensitive to -3 EV (but only the center point), allows interchangeable focusing screens for improved manual focusing, etc.What I miss most about my 6D is that all of the essential buttons are located on the right side for quick and easy access with one hand, whereas some of the 5DIII's are spread out on both sides and therefore require two hands. Also, although the 6D lacks as many AF points as the 5DIII and only has a single center cross-type AF point, that one center point is sensitive to -3 EV (more sensitive than any other Canon DSLR), which is equivalent to focusing under moonlight!In conclusion, pick the body that suits YOUR needs, not somebody else's. Why pay twice as much for something you don't need or will rarely use? Although the 5DIII is an overall \"better\" camera (and is priced accordingly), sometimes the better camera isn't better [or necessary] for everyone.I hope this helps.

Taking constant photos I lasted a wedding without the battery losing a bar except I had the wifi and GPS function off. Also learned if you leave on the GPS it works with the camera off so there is that too. The silent shutter and silent burst shutter are actually quiet. I use it at a wedding with another photographer who was using a camera without a feature like this and that camera was 10x louder than mine.

Lee", "ReviewID": "R192WBDT6OY6J3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to jump to FF from crop. Researched, researched, debated and debated over and over between the Nikon D610 vs. Canon 6D for weeks! I'm coming from shooting a Nikon and have been a Nikon fan for many years from the F3. This is for those in similar situations where they just need one simple review to help them decide between the D610 or 6D before they go slightly crazy as I did.On magazines and online reviews, the D610 specs just looked so much better than 6D, esp. the AF system 11 vs. 39 pts. But, if you are looking to buy a camera at this level, you probably have done your own research and there are numerous reviews as to specs out there, so let's leave the specs out of this review.SHORT REVIEW:Feel: the feel of the camera is fantastic! It is solid and well built. I held the D610, which is also solid, but I really liked the feel and grip of the 6D. Solid. Plus, all the function buttons are located on the right side which makes it easier to shoot with only one hand. Made in Japan reassures that its a quality product (not that Nikon isn't).Looks: I always thought and still believe that Nikon has that sexy look to it even from the F3 vs. F1 standpoint. Canon on the other hand, less sexy IMHO. But, I'm actually liking the simplistic design of the Canon in my hand esp. so because of the pro-level feel. Nice.Day Pics: On my 1st run with the 6D, I compared the photos vs. my son's D90 on the camera's LCD screen. It was a very sunny day at the Getty Center. Anything you shoot there on a sunny day produces great images. I thought to myself, \"well I guess it looks a little better\" than the D90. But at home, the 6D's pictures are sharper and more defined (try zooming to test). The color was also excellent! If you are ready to move up to FF, this is a great camera that produces excellent images.Night Pics: Ok, so one of the main reasons I chose the 6D is its low-light capability. This is where the camera really shines. The same day my son and I shot at Santa Monica at night. We snapped away and compared the photos. Even on the LCD screen, the 6D images were so much better at the same ISO. Colors were bright and natural. D90 less so. Caveat, the D90 is not a D610 and is unable to compete with a newer pro-level FF camera and I am not here to compare a D90 to the 6D, but was compared only to share my experiences with the 6D. At home, OMG - the nights were so awesome on the 6D! All the reviewers are right in that 6D rocks for night shooting. I am sold.WIFI/GPS: Ok, at first I thought why?? I rather have a mag-alloy top or a flash in the same spot. But, the WIFI is pretty cool and convenient. I downloaded an app on my phone and instantly messaged a photo to my wife's phone in a few short minutes. This will be awesome to instantly transfer to my Flickr page. As to the GPS, I turned it off to save battery - I don't need it.Why I chose 6D over D610: Ok, I was sitting around comparing reviews after reviews, images after images and debating camera vs. value, etc etc. Basically, I realized that I was wasting time by not being out and about taking pictures. I also was getting a headache. So, I decide to pull the trigger on the 6D based on my own Ultimate Decision Maker for Buying below:MY ULTIMATE DECISION MAKER FOR BUYING:1) Am I a pro? YES -> buy/rent what you need - I would go for 1DX2) Can I spend $3500 on a camera body without flinching? YES -> 5D mk3 / NO -> goto #53) Can I spend $3500 on a camera body without flinching but prefer studio shooting? YES -> D800 / NO -> 5D mk34) (optional) Should I consider mirror-less? IMHO \"image\" of a profession still matters (lawyers should wear suits at court with his/her client; and photographers should bring bigger cameras at the shoot than his/her clients). Smaller the camera, less pro you look. Of course, this is up to the buyer - you pick. I prefer bigger cameras and lens.For anyone who really wants a FF camera but will flinch uncomfortably at the though of spending $3500 on a camera body:5) Do I shoot a lot at night or low-light conditions? YES -> 6D / No -> D6106) Do I shoot a lot of sports? YES -> D610 / No -> 6D7) Do I plan to buy more specialized lens in the future (ultra wide or ultra zoom), but I'm on a budget? YES -> 6D / No -> D610 (Nikon lens tend to be more expensive for those types of lens). Again, if you're rich or a pro, buy whatever suits your fancy.8) Do I have a lot of money invested in one brand of lens (more than 3)? YES -> stick with that brand / NO -> 6D9) I found an extra $1500 or so lying around the house. Then go buy yourself a 5D mk3.All the other specs and stuff: well that's really up to the individual buyer. I really think that you can't go wrong with either a 6D or a D610; it really comes down to sports vs. low-light shooting preferences. Don't spend too much time debating which to buy, rather go take more photos instead.I did and I am really happy with the 6D.Good luck that was fun!", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easy on the shoulder and amazing image quality!", "Author": "P.K. Frary \"Gochugogi\"", "ReviewID": "R2OVU80A5LR7ND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I also own a 5D MK II and 60D and the 6D is a near marriage of the two older cameras: full frame innards of the 5D MKII coupled with the petite form factor and controls of the 60D. Toss in Wi-Fi, GPS, AF tweaks, enhanced high ISO, and that's the 6D in a nutshell.CONSTRUCTION: The 6D is a handsome camera with top notch fit and finish: tough magnesium body shell, engineering grade plastic top panel and matte black paint. I suspect the plastic panel was used to enhance Wi-Fi/GPS reception. Canon claims the 6D is weather resistant to the same level as the 7D and 1N and, indeed, mist and light rain don't faze it but I'd protect it in a downpour. The textured rubber grip is comfortable for my medium sized hands and feels secure. It's noticeably smaller and lighter than a 5D MKII and the same size and weight as the 60D.The 6D is very quiet. My 5D MKII and 70D thunder next to it. However, if quiet isn't enough, silent drive mode can fade operation to pianissimo, making it idea for stage and intimate ceremonies.The 3.0\" 1,040,000 dot LCD is vivid and clear and spanks my 5D MKII in terms of clarity. It appears to the same LCD as the 60D but without the articulating ability.CONTROLS: The Spartan control interface was inherited from the 60D but buttons and wheels feel a little more solid and precise. Like the 60D, there's no joystick, and dedicated flash exposure compensation (FEC) and white balance buttons are MIA. FEC is set on the LCD. I prefer a dedicated FEC button so flash compensation may be applied while looking through the viewfinder. One control was inherited from the 7D: a button/switch on the upper right for toggling between LiveView and video.AUTOFOCUS: The 6D AF array has the same diamond shaped coverage as the 5D MKII, a single cross point (center) but two additional outer points. The center AF point has been significantly enhanced and is amazingly sensitive and sure-footed in low light. It can snag focus in closets and caves! The 10 single axis outer points are not nearly as senstive but are better than those of the 5D MKII. All in all, a big step up from 5D MKII AF.Contrast AF used in LiveView/Video is pokey compared to an Olympus Pen or S90, but a level faster and more sure-footed than contrast AF on the 60D or 7D, and a couple levels better than the 5D MKII. If you're not in a hurry, it's very accurate and fine for macro and product shots.IMAGE QUALITY: RAW image output very similar t the 5D MKII from ISO 100 to 1600, i.e., great! The 6D comes into its own at high ISO, and coupled with ultra sensitive AF, is an amazing low light camera. By ISO 3200 the 6D pulls away from the 5D MKII and is shockingly good at ISO 12800 with only moderate noise reduction. Beyond ISO 12800 is emergency use for me, but if I need to shoot at ISO 102400 the center AF point is up to the task. I'm not an avid \"shadow lifter\" but the 6D is amazingly clean--less patterned artifacts--and you can easily bump up shadows another stop over the 5D MKII when needed.WI-FI: WI-FI via the EOS Remote app can be used to set exposure, select AF points, fire the shutter., etc. Like the wired EOS remote, you can use LiveView or save images on your iPhone, iPad or Droid. Wi-Fi drains the battery fast, so have spares ready. My only complaint is Wi-Fi is needlessly complicated to set up.GPS setup is easy: two or three menu selections, point the pentaprism at the sky and you're done. However, acquiring a GPS signal in downtown Honolulu was impossible due to tall buildings and nearby mountains. I was able to catch the signal here and there on Oahu but found GPS spotty. I had hoped GPS would bring clarity to my befuddling vacation images but I'll reserve final judgement until I get travel time in North America during the summer. For now, I disabled GPS since it shortens battery life.VIEWFINDER: The quality of the optical viewfinder is astounding. On paper the specs of 97% coverage and .71x magnification are less impressive than the 5D MKII/III. However, viewfinder clarity is a level above my 5D MK II, 60D or 7D. Even with a slowish F4 zoom the focusing screen is bright, grainless, smooth and vivid. It's a real pleasure to shoot with.FLASH: Although the 6D is a prosumer camera aimed at serious hobbyists, it lacks a popup flash. My 430EX II Speedlite works great but I miss having a popup for fill flash and E-TTL trigger use. If you're looking for a small Speedlite, consider the Canon 270EX II  Speedlite Flash for Canon SLR Cameras (Black): it fits in a pocket, can bounce and is about twice as powerful as a popup.LAST BLURB: Canon's blend of features from multiple cameras make the 6D the a highly evolved and refined camera. Tried and true works for me: menus, features and controls were very familiar. I barely needed to crack the manual. I also love the small form factor combined with full frame format. It's easy on the shoulder, able to capture clean and vivid images in almost any light and, for me, the ideal travel DSLR.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "P. Vo", "ReviewID": "R32WFK6MPT7HGZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "24 January 2013 - Update.I downloaded the Wi-Fi app into my IOS devices. It works great. I can put my 6D near ground level and pointing up, preview the composition and take the shot. My wife can review pictures taken before I load them up into my laptop. The only downside to this app is that it drains the battery of my IOS devices quicker than I wish.Original review:Photography is my hobby.  I take pictures on weekends, vacation, or business travels for my company.  Also, I like to geo-tag my pictures as a way to remind me where the photos were taken. So for me, this camera is great.People's complaints about its 20 MP (vs. 24 MP of some other brand) sound misplaced to me.  The consequence of this low pixel count is the low pixel density, which resulted in excellent noise performance in low light / high ISO of the 6D.  Since many pictures I took and will take are during business travel for my employer, they are taken mostly at or after sunset, or indoors.  This very low-noise at high ISO performance of the 6D is a very big positive for me.The 6D has 11 AF points (vs. some very high count of some other brand).  More than enough for hobbyist like me.The lack of a built-in flash is at worst -1/2 star, in my view.  I rarely used the pop-up flash since this kind of flash is typically weak.  Canon's decision to forgo the built-in flash to make room for the Wi-Fi and GPS circuitry is commendable.  Since the performance of the 6D in low-light / high ISO is so good, my need for a pop flash is greatly reduced; I like pictures with a more natural look.  Besides, I carry an external flash anyway.  As for the sync speed of the flash (1/180 vs 1/200), I struggle to imagine a case that this small difference would affect me.Talking about Wi-Fi.  The feature is another big plus, in my opinion.  my smartphone or my tablet will act as a cable release.  And I can review my pictures on my tablet soon afterward, a much better proposition than viewing them on the display on the back of the camera, without having to wait for a laptop or desktop.The lack of 2nd card slot may be a deficiency of the 6D vs. its competitors.  But so far, all my cameras have only one card slot; So I don't find this \"deficiency\" a big deal.The 97% viewfinder of the 6D (vs. ~100% of other full-frame cameras) is a more significant issue.  On rare occasions, I do end up with additional elements at the fringes / edges of my pictures than I anticipated since they didn't show up in my viewfinder.  Again, these occurrences are few and far in between.A very nice surprise is the very low noise the mirror of the 6D makes as it flips up.  And I didn't even put it in silent mode.  Will try this mode (and others) as soon as I can.  After all, I only have this camera for 3 days.I took a few pictures of my wife inside our home, under incandescent lights, with ISO set to 25600, and with GPS on.  The results were great.  The GPS was surprisingly accurate.  Sorry guys, I won't post these pictures up.In conclusion, I find the pluses of the 6D far outweigh the perceived deficiencies.

Unfortunately, due to the sensor dust issues, I returned and stayed away.-Canon 6D - I held on to buying, until more reviews came in.I was still hopeful to go to Nikon, thinking maybe it will be fixed in future release (like what i heard with D800), because I keep on hearing that Canon 6d is \"under-spec\" or \"crippled\" compared to d600.  In the meantime, I made a \"real-life\" comparison (at least for me) between the \"under-spec\" Canon 6d compared to Nikon D600:Advantages of d600 vs 6d--------------------------24 vs 20  - no bearing to me, I was so happy with 18mp APS-C already.-FPS of 5.5 vs 4.5 - well if you look at my shooting situations above, this is not a big deal to me, and the focusing of 6D is actually faster than Canon 60d, both in low light and outside.-Built in flash - for me this is only nice to have, even my wife does not want me to use a flash that cannot be bounced because it washes out the colors, if you really want flash, get an external one that you can bounce and diffuse the intensity of the flash.  Also with 6D, I don't find a need to use flash anymore on my indoor shoots, specially when I use my prime lens that I bought with the camera (28mm 1.8).-Dynamic range - what I keep on reading is d600 has the edge, but from what I heard is the difference is not that much and only matters if you do \"pixel peeping\".-2 card slots for saving pictures - Maybe for pros yes, not for me.-More focus points - I always hated moving that focus point, because it is not as quick as I want them to be. I only use them in controlled settings, for hand-held shooting, I just do point and refocus or use auto, this ensures capture of the moment by \"focusing on what to capture, not where to focus\". Both cameras have all their focus points centered in the middle anyway, so I don't really get having many focus points if you are all just going to concentrate them on the center.Advantages of 6d vs d600-------------------------JPEG picture quality is very excellent.  I think Canon has the best JPEG engine, I can definitely reduce the need to work with RAW files.-Great camera for Indoors due to excellent high ISO performance, which covers 90% of my needs.  And focus is very fast in low light.-GPS built-in, Works really well, this will cover my vacations.-WiFi built in - I've used it for self portrait and controlled shooting setups with the Christmas Tree in the foyer!  I used the Canon EOS remote app on my iPhone to do this, it is very cool and easy to use. I was able to control the camera and view the shots in my iPhone, download the pictures to the phone and emailed it to myself!  This is another breakthrough for Canon, just like the excellent implementation of touch screen interface in Canon t4i swivel screen.-It is actually cheaper than d600 if you compare the 2 kits they offer.  d600 $2499 with 24-85, 6d $2699 with 24-105.  For $200 difference, you get an extra 20mm in lens reach and the lens itself is an 'L', meaning it is Canon's luxury line of lenses known for excellent optical quality and weather sealing.  The Canon 24-105L lens itself if bought separately retails for $ 1,149, while Nikon's 24-85 is only $599.95.-Live View is actually usable compared to d600, but still not as great as Sony's implementation-Focusing outside with trees and running dogs is great, It is not a 5d Mark III or 7d - so it is just what I expected.-No annoying green tint on the LCD display-Although d600 viewfinder is 3% bigger than 6d, 6d is actually cleaner and brighter.  I'm actually surprised by this, d600 looks dim and less detailed specially indoors with not so ideal lighting.-More videos are even coming out regarding the dust/oil sensor issues.  I even saw a video showing after doing a blower and wet cleaning, the dust/oil still returns(see link below).  This might be the reason why they are selling them way below the original MSRP of the d600 kit price.  Also, cleaning the sensor yourself is a delicate and complicated process that most people would rather not do, if you're cleaning cause damage, your warranty might be void.[...]I'm sure there are other differences that tech geeks will point out but none of them matters to my needs.  One thing I noticed going through the \"review\" blogs is that there are more tech geek bloggers rather than real photographers. It became a specs war rather than real life usability comparison. It is the same thing I noticed when I bought my first tablet, there are other higher spec tablets compared to Apple's iPad, but I ended up with iPad because of usability and features that matter to me more than anything else so I can use it, not to feel good because somebody thinks the other brand is a \"better buy\".I also don't have any full frame lenses or gear investment, so I'm not saving money with any brand.So that's how I ended up with Canon 6d.What will make 6d perfect for me?-Swivel LCD screen-Touch screen interface-Improve the Live View shooting performance.And for the usual final word of most review sites : \"Choose one that works for you, both take excellent pictures and you won't go wrong in any one of them\".....Cheers !*** Update on FPS ***Tested the FPS/Max burst with my new SanDisk Extreme Pro 32 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 95MB/s.

I loved both those cameras and wasn't really in the market for a new body until my 5d1 took a nasty spill and the AF light indicator stopped working. I thought about picking up a 2nd 5d2 or another 5d1 on the used market but in the end I decided it would be a good time to upgrade.The 1dx was out of my price range, the 70d is a crop camera (no offense to crop shooters it just doesn't fit my style or lens lineup) so it came down to the 5d3 or 6d. Luckily I had access to both cameras so I was able to play around with both as well as get other photographer's opinions before deciding. I concluded that while the 5d3 was clearly the \"better\" camera, it wasn't really the better camera for ME.The main gripe people seemed to have against the 6d (at least based on specs) is the lack luster AF system. Not enough points, only one cross type, etc. This worried me a bit because the only complaint I had about the 5d2 was the AF could be a little frustrating at times. It wasn't a major complaint however, I never totally missed a big moment or amazing picture because of the 5d2 AF, it just made me work a little harder in low light sometimes and so I was hoping for at least an upgrade in that department.So when I used the 6d for the first time I pleasantly surprised to find that, despite the complaints I had read about from spec watchers, the 6d AF actually was a decent improvement from the 5d2. Yes, it would have been nice to have a gazillion cross-type AF points like the 5d3, but again my frustrations with the 5d2 AF were never that dramatic. The 6d added a couple more points and is both quicker and more accurate so I was satisfied. I really only use 3 focus points anyway, center and the the two outer most points.Another aspect where the 6d pleasantly surprised me was ISO performance. ISO on the 5d2 was quite good, I shot to 3200 regularly and would occasionally go to 6400 if it was a shot I really needed but I found/find that with the 6d I can get good, usable shots at 12800. I could maybe push it further but I've never had to try. The 5d3 I used was fantastic on ISO as well but not quite as good as the 6d. While focus points aren't a huge deal with me, ISO performance is so this was a major bonus for the 6d.A couple more things that I thought might bother me about the 6d but haven't been an issue for me: (1)SD cards... I prefer CF cards but SDs are more affordable and don't require a reader. It wasn't hard to sell myself on that (2) 1/180 sync speed. I shoot some OCF and I was worried about that but 1/180 vs 1/200 hasn't been much different... (3)the joy stick. I sometimes find myself searching with my thumb for that joystick but I don't mind the d-pad at all, I just have to get used to using it. (4) 1/4000 second shutter speed. I have a 50/1.2 and I might have to stop it down a little in bright, bright conditions but it hasn't come up yet. I can drop the ISO to 50 and that usually takes care of the issue.The only really significant factor that appealed to me about the 5d3 over the 6d was the dual memory slots... that would be a nice luxury to have but frankly, I lived without it before on the prior 5d's so I can live without it now. I'd rather have the wifi of the 6d anyway.With all those function and performance based issues out of the way, I can move on to the more practical matter of cost. Like I said, I shoot weddings, portraits, and events. Its a business for me and consequently every purchase I make has to make financial sense for my business. The 6d will deliver the exact same results as the 5d3 will for the type of work I do and it costs half as much. That was not a difficult decision for me to make.Again, I'm not saying that 6d is a better camera than the 5d3, clearly its not, I'm just saying that it's the better camera for ME. In the end I retired my 5d1, sold my 5d2 and then picked up two 6d's for a little less than the price of one 5d3... It's nice having two identical bodies with the same batteries, same memory cards, and same amazing ISO performance. As much as I loved my 5d1, it's tragic demise may have been a good thing for me in the end!", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best affordable full frame camera you can own", "Author": "Andris", "ReviewID": "R2DFD4SS06GBC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera lacks those few features that make other cameras so much more expensive. But guess what - not everyone needs those features when you can have so much more for the same price. To put it short I will list the best features of this camera and the \"unnecessary\" missing features:+ lightweight - this is currently the lightest full frame DSLR camera and for those who travel a lot this is important. It is even lighter than many crop sensor cameras, e.g., Canon 7D+ it has the same full frame sensor as Canon 5D Mark III so you will get the same quality photos as with 5DmkIII, but for the fraction of price+ it has GPS and WiFi integrated - again, this is very useful if you are passionate traveler as I amNow the cons:- it's relatively slow - this camera is not intended for sports photography with just 4.5 frames per second, if you need to shoot sports go for the quickest of the line which is 7D (8 fps)- it has relatively few focus points of which only the center point is cross-type - I don't see this as a drawback since I use only center point for focusing 99% of the time anyway. And in addition to that the center point performance is spectacular and you can easily focus even in the candle light- it doesn't have tilt LCD screen however it feels more robust this way- it doesn't have flash - but built-in flashes are poor performers anyway, so I think it's wise to save on the weight of the camera and put there GPS and WiFi insteadTo summarize I think this is the best Canon line camera you can buy today and considering it's weight and the fact that it is full frame I think it's a great value. If you are into sports photography or need those extra tiny things which you won't use most of the time anyway, then go one line up or choose Canon 7D. If you don't care about full frame sensor, choose Canon SL1 instead and you will not miss a thing.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "One more feature worth mentioning...", "Author": "Paul D.

Got the battery charged and off I went.  I owned a 5D for three years then sold it in anticipation of getting a 5DII as I had been happy with the images but not with the focusing on the 5D.  Unfortunately the focusing on the 5DII wasn't much better so I sent it back, puttered around with Sony Nex5 and 7's waiting for this camera to arrive (the 5DIII was too $$$).  So, how is it?  It feels really solid.  It's not like the bullet proof top end cameras, but it does feel more solid than the original 5D did.  I haven't used a 60D or any of the Canon smaller sensor cameras so I cannot compare to those.The shutter sounds great, quieter than the 5D.  The menu system is more streamlined, though they've moved everything around so that will take a few days to sort out.  The focusing is much, much improved over the 5D and 5DII.  The JPGs look great, much better than shots from a NEX7, better in low light than the 5D.  Very happily, skin tones are fabulous, as they were with the 5D.  I don't have a Nikon 600D or Sony A99 to compare to.  That said, I am extremely happy with the camera.  The 5D was a great landscape and portrait camera and the 6D improves on the things I hated about it.  Plus a modest gain in detail to boot!  As I shoot more over the next couple of weeks I'll update this.  I can't comment on the cost, for some folks it's too much, and for others it's \"affordable.\"  It seems to have a great sensor, it focuses well in dimly lit interior spaces (my home study is lit by two 60 watt bulbs and it focuses quickly), feels great in my hands, and doesn't have a lot of extra stuff I won't use (other than GPS).  The wifi is not quite ready for prime time (feels like V 0.9), though the potential is obvious and is going to be crazy cool for all sorts of remote uses.  If you have canon lenses and the 5DIII seems to much, and the 7D not quite there, I don't think you can go wrong.  If you have someone else's lenses, who knows?12/9.  Some other initial impressions.  There is no noise, none, at ISO<1600.  Dark/shadow areas at ISO 800 require no noise reduction at all.  Skin tones are accurate, smooth and seem flattering (albeit accurately).  On the down side, the canon software for converting the raw files is brutally bad.  Hopefully Adobe will release an update for Lightroom sooner rather than later that will address this.  Last, I suspect the reviews that claim the camera is super light may not have held the camera.  It's very solid.  On paper it's 4 oz less than the original 5D, and it is way lighter than the 1dX sized cameras, but in no way does it feel light a la the rebel models.  The buttons on the back are *not* solid feeling, rather cheesy actually.  The menu system is easy to get sorted out.  Used focus-tune to adjust the micro focus for my 50mm and 24-105mm zoom and found that after repeated calibrations the camera lens combinations I used are all reliable (in the sense that they don't vary sig from test to test).

I am amazed every time I download the pictures to my computer.  Even after close examination of the full size files compared to the 1Dx and the 5D mark III, the images are absolutely every bit as good.  High ISO noise handling is superb.  I've found it to be slightly better than the 5D, but just barely under the 1Dx.I have no problem with the focusing system at all.  The center point in particular will focus in extremely low light.  The other sensors are perfectly usable in anything but very dim lighting and are accurate enough for me to shoot close up headshots and portraits at f/2 and still get very sharp focusing on the eye.  I love the smaller size of the body.  It's a little lighter and more convenient to carry.  I have really big hands, but the way the grip is designed makes it comfortable for me to hold.  I generally don't use any preprogrammed modes, but a couple settings are really useful:  Hand held night scene and hand held HDR.  They work really well!  The camera takes a series of shots and lines everything up perfectly.  Its not as good as using a tripod, but if you don't have one on you or have time to set it up, its fantastic!I have no opinion of movie mode.  I don't ever shoot video, but it does full HD, so that's cool too.The controls are well thought out and I actually like the placement better than my 7D.  The only surprises I've found so far are that the shutter only goes up to 1/4000th instead of 1/8000th and the maximum strobe sync speed is 1/180th instead of 1/250th. I still give it 5 stars because those speeds are just fine.  The only time I would ever need 1/8000th is if I were shooting in the brightest daylight possible at f/2.

The refurbished replacement so far is *****. Average of the two ***).Focusing: ***Service:***I bought this camera on December 4th, 2012. I really enjoyed it until May 2013 when I used it at Magee Marsh OH to shoot a great horned owl. The camera went dead completely just before I could get a good shot of the bird. The battery was almost full before it went dead. I tried re-inserting the battery and restarting the camera. It didn't work. After 2hours driving home, it suddenly worked again. I hoped it was just a random glitch and would not happen again. So I didn't sent it back for repair. However, the same problem happened a few more times in June. I didn't return it because I really need a good camera to shoot various events. Starting in July, it basically died on me every time when I went outside for more than 2 hours (maybe 2 or 3 hundreds shots). I made sure it's not a battery problem by inserting fully charged canon batteries after the problem happened. It usually came back to life after 2 or 3 hours rest. It became so unreliable so that I had to send it to NJ canon service center for repair on July 5th. One week later, I got it back. The first time I used it, it became dead after 3 hours. So I had to send it back to NJ service center the 2nd time for the same problem. They replaced \"power assembly\" this time. I thought the problem should be gone. To my disappointment/surprise, when I used it for 3 hours/297shots, the camera was dead again! I had to send it back the 3rd time last Friday(8/2) for the same problem. I had to call basically everyday to get status of the problem/resolution. Just one hour ago, I was told by Canon PR person on the phone that they found the problem it was a faulty CMOS. They replaced it and will mail me back the 6D.Three \"repairs\" in one month for the same problem!  Countless lost opportunities/wasted time on the phone/wasted gas to/from photo destinations! I am not even sure this third \"repair\" will fix the problem! I now totally lost confidence in my 6D.I suspect that the problem is NOT an isolated case. I saw at least two people had the same 6d problem as mine on canonrumor forum. One of guys had 6d repaired three times including replacing \"base plate\" (I don't know what that is). He still had the problem after 3 repairs. So Canon gave him a new retail box. I asked Canon to give me a replacement 6D. They refused. I thought that they at least should treat customer equally and do the same thing for me.In short, 6D's quality is not reliable. It may die after 3-4 hours heavy use (maybe 300+ pics) in 80F degree temperature. I suspect that more 6D having the same problem. It is just not discovered by most users because it is only exposed after heavy use in relatively high temperature. (I used it + canon 100-400mm lens/Al Servo AF mode for birding).If you do have a 6D, test it heavily before your 1 year warranty expires. It may expose this problem you may otherwise won't be able to discover.I will get my camera back after 3rd repair in the next few days. I'll report back the outcome again.9/6/2013: I received a replacement 6d after sending it back 4th time for a SD card slot problem. I change the 6d rating from * to **. I will test out the replacement 6d and adjust rating based on my experience with the replacement and the original one. Please don't criticize me for giving 6d such a low rate. I can only rate things based on the cameras I used. I don't have canon 6d statistics. I am pretty sure the overall 6d rating should be higher than mine. I hope that everything will be fine and I will enjoy 6d again.10/8/2013: Just came back from a 3 1/2 week photo trip. The replacement refurbished 6d was fully tested under tough weather conditions.

Overall, it is but not in all ways.  The body is a bit smaller and lighter, which is good, and the top of the body that is plastic instead of magnesium alloy in the 5D3 is not noticeable at all, nor is the plastic instead of the glass LCD screen cover.  I can't really tell the difference.  The LCD is slightly smaller (0.2\" or so) but not a big deal to me.  The viewfinder shows 97% instead of 100% but that doesn't make a big difference to me either (since the pics include everything that I can see plus a bit more).  I welcome the simpler autofocus system of the 6D (never fully learned how to use the complex AF system on the 5D3).  The low light performance seems to be really good, and I've read that it's slightly superior on the 6D anyway.  The wifi is nice addition on the 6D since it lets you have better control over wifi uploads than when using an eye-fi card (since you can pick what to upload from your computer and not your camera).The only thing I don't like is that the 6D is slightly but significantly slower at focusing and shooting.  With my 5D3, I could pick up my camera and start shooting away shot after shot in rapid succession (each shot separately) without almost any delay.  With the 6D, there is that split second (probably less than half a second) delay between shots that is much more noticeable and annoying than I anticipated.  Not sure if it's just slower AF or also a slower shutter mechanism (probably just AF) but it's noticeable and a hindrance, especially since I need to shoot fast when taking pics of my fast-moving kid.Anyway, the 6D is a nice full frame DSLR overall for the casual photographer but the slower AF/shooting is something that you should check out for yourself before plunking down the money to buy one (I got mine at that popular auction site and so I can't readily return it).

I have had this camera for approx 2 months.Much has been written editorially and by end-users about the Canon 6D, so I will highlight only items which are most relevant to my experience thus far.Canon 6D lay-out - As a creature of habit, initially I was a bit dismayed with the feature lay-out of the Canon 6D. This is in comparison to my Canon 50D which I have owned for several years. After a couple of sessions, I have come to really enjoy the well thought out lay-out  of this camera. First, the \"Off/On\" switch is located top left below the Mode Dial. Second, the Mode Dial has a lock button to prevent inadvertent changes. Third, I really like how the Quick Control & Multi-controller dials have evolved into a single dial. Fourth, the Back Focus button (AF-ON) is located in a very accessible spot - on the 50D, I constantly fumble to locate it without looking. Finally, I also like the location of the Live View access button - much more intuitive than the 50D.Full Frame - As I previously mentioned, my other DSLR is a Canon 50D. This camera uses what is commonly referred to as a \"crop sensor\". When I first got the 50D, I was thrown off by the change in perspective compared to my Canon SLR film camera. That said, I am so happy to be shooting Full Frame again! I won't get into all of the technical reasons why Full Frame over APS-C/Crop Sensor except to say, I am thrilled with the light gathering capability of the 6D. I can shoot at lower iso's thus reducing any image noise potential. 6D - 20.2mp/50D - 15.1mp. Fyi, my primary lens are: 24-70mm f/2.8L USM & 70-200mm f/4.0L IS USM.Shutter - I don't know if it's my imagination, the Canon 6D seems to have a relatively quiet shutter. Editorials and end-users have commented on continuous shooting speed. I'll just say 4.5fps will not set the world on fire by today's standards. It is plenty fast so long as I am not shooting action sports/scenes. My 50D shoots @ 6.3fps which will be well suited for action shots.AF Points - I generally use center auto focus point. Having a gazillion auto focus points is not a priority nor a requirement for my needs.Media card - The 6D uses an SD card. And there is only one slot. Some cameras now have multiple slots and can use both Compact Flash & SD. As above, not a priority nor a requirement for my shooting needs.Manual focus - In combination of the location of the Live View & the Magnify buttons, manual focusing has now become an integral part of shooting technique/routine. Fyi, AF works as expected.Battery life - In general, battery life is as expected and acceptable. Now that I am shooting more in Live View, battery life has decreased (as expected). I will be buying at least one more battery for a back-up.New technology | WiFi & GPS - Presently, I do not use the WiFi feature. Since I usually shoot on the fly and like to pack light, I do not carry a laptop/iPad. At some point, I will explore integrating WiFi into my routine. GPS is a real cool feature for geo-tagging. Call me old fashion/old school... I have no compelling reason to geo-tag at this time. Like WiFi, I will explore later and perhaps use. That said, these two features are battery power guzzlers. So the upside for me is my battery(s) will last longer in the field.Build - I am liking the build and feel of the 6D. It fits my hand very well. Feels solid. The body is textured in all the right places.Flash - No built in flash. No biggie here as I prefer using external light sources.Conclusion - Overall, I am thrilled to have this camera in my bag. It has performed (thus far) to expectations. When my skills grow and expand, I will consider a 5D. In the meantime, I look fwd to viewing my new photos after a shoot and determine if any are worthy of those slick photo gifts (canvas prints, glass prints, metal sublimation prints) for family & friends! Ps: still using the 50D for action stuff and where a little more reach is needed.---Product Review Update - Jun 10th, 2013When I wrote the above Canon 6D product review, I had used the 6D for about two months. Since the original review, I have had the opportunity to use this camera in the field extensively. That said, I would like to add additional comments referencing the Canon 6D.Canon 6D lay-out - I have completely bought into the intuitive lay-out of the 6D. Besides to usual AF/Drive/ISO/Metering buttons on the top right of the camera, the consolidation of the Quick Control dial, the Multi-controller & Set button is well thought out, easy-to-access and intuitive. I like this set-up much better than the separate joy-stick/multi-controller found on my 50D. To access the shooting functions, all I have to do is push the \"Q\" button and navigate with the Quick Control/Multi-controller/Set button. Easy peazy.Shutter - Even in standard mode, the shutter on the Canon 6D is noticeably quiet. Nice feature.Continuous shooting mode - I have started to shoot in continuous mode especially when bracketing my shots. Note: I also shoot in RAW. I haven't really noticed any significant buffer lag while shooting in continuous mode. Generally, I will shoot in bursts of three shots, pause, and shoot in another burst. 4.5 fps seems to meet my needs well.Ai Servo - When I am not using manual focus, I am using Ai Servo. Works very well as expected especially with continuous shooting mode.Image noise - Although, I haven't really pushed the camera to high ISO range, shots in standard ISO range from 100 to 800 have exhibited no noise to speak of.Picture Styles - I really like this Canon feature. In a nutshell, you can select a Picture Style like Standard, Neutral, Faithful, Landscape, Portrait & Monochrome. The camera processor will render the image based on the style selected. In addition, when you use Canon's Digital Photo Professional (DPP) software, you can additional styles to DPP's library.Remote - On tripod shots, I use a Canon RS-80N3 wired shutter remote. You may ask why I wouldn't use the wireless remote feature... well, the wireless remote sensor is located on the front of the camera on the camera grip. This means the wireless remote needs to be in line of sight with sensor to operate reliably. This is fine if you are taking a picture of yourself or yourself in a group.Battery - Since I am not using the GPS & WiFi technology features, I find battery discharge rates to be acceptable. I shoot in \"Live Mode\", use continuous shooting mode, review images when shot, review histograms - all the features which can drain a battery. I haven't run into any issues even on longer shoots. I am purchasing at least one additional battery for back-up(s).Final comments - As before, I am pleased as punch with the Canon 6D. It has performed as published and I look forward to growing my photography skills to the next level with this camera. And btw, I am still using (and will continue to use) my 50D. It's a great action camera and does well on \"moon\" shots.

The app lets me save the images (.jpg only) and I can email, or share them across social media.For the price, it would be hard to find a better lens that works in nearly all situations.Cons:Despite these strengths, there are some things I was disappointing with.- Having only a single cross-type auto-focus point means having to focus and recompose shots. Bodies that are a lot cheaper have more cross focus points, so I don't understand why they didn't include that with the 6D. That being said, the auto-focus does work well enough that this is seldom an issue.- You cannot enter video mode when Wi-Fi is enabled. This really sucks. I was hoping to be able to use Wi-Fi as a video monitor when filming but I can't. Instead I have to use a PC through the USB connection. What's really annoying is that if you forget Wi-Fi is on, and want to shoot a video, you have to go into the settings and disable it before you can film. They should have at least automatically disabled Wi-Fi when you switch the camera to movie mode.Neutral:- GPS is useful in some applications, but I find myself never turning it on.- It would have been nice to have auto-focus in video. This feature has been showing up in APS-C bodies recently, but hasn't made it to any FF bodies yet.Overall:This is a really great camera, and perfect for someone looking to step into the Full Frame world. Unless you can get a great deal on a 5D (Mk. 2 or 3) I'd recommend this camera. If you're fine with APS-C, you might be able to save some money and stick with a 60D, or perhaps a 7D.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "How to send 6D photos directly to email or Facebook via iPhone", "Author": "FlyingPolarBear", "ReviewID": "R1F6V1HM94YBS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow - having upgraded from the Canon Rebel XTi crop sensor camera, I am blown away by this EOS 6D, especially the high ISO capability for low light, WiFi, and GPS.

Bravo Canon!", "Author": "MT1", "ReviewID": "R25CAIL26X49CQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So as a loyal nikon fan for 15+ years, I have seen nikon cameras come and go. My last experience was with the D600. I had the pleasure of owning two of the d600's that had the lubricant/debris issue. I finally had enough of nikon after the way that they just made the D610 and left the rest of us behind. Nikon has had a lot of quality control problems as of late but the issue is not that things went wrong with the product because that can happen with anything but it is how they abandoned the users and never admitted a problem.My opinion is that when you buy a camera and start to add on lenses, flashes and accessories,  you are starting a system and the longterm plan needs to include knowing that the company that made the product, is going to stand behind it. I am now of the opinion that Canon has a completely different way of handling such issues. Looking at the canon website, it includes actual service advisories and clear disclosure of known issues. No such luck with nikon. One check of the website and no mention of any problems. Along with the poor QC and customer service, nikon has now started to use impact damage as another excuse to cash in.Now if you are on the fence about which camera D600/D610 vs 6D, I can honestly tell you that the 6D is the system to invest in unless you have an absolute need of the dynamic range of the d610.The 6D is well made, the design and fit to me is better, the AF system has been great in my testing so far, the wifi system is a time/lifesaver in studio shoots, no lubricant/debris splatter, sharp sharp images out of the camera and just an overall great package. The D600/D610 offers dual slot cards and better dynamic range. I amIn total disagreement about the D600 af system. between my two D600's, I had shot over 20,000 photos (weddings) and I can tell you that the canon has less cross type points on paper but the hit rate on the canon is far more. I would also get random backfocus on the d600 under tungsten lighting which I have not seen with the 6D. The 6D center af sensor point is good to -3 EV and I can confirm that It works in almost complete darkness. It is just amazing. No random hunting on the 6D focus system compared to the D600.At the end of the day, I feel that canon is one step behind nikon on dynamic range but miles ahead on quality control and customer service. I feel if you are starting from the ground up, you would be very happy with canons offerings. I switched to canon and sold all my nikon gear at a huge loss because I could no longer deal with nikons careless way of dealing with issues.You have to ask yourself what matters to you more? Dynamic range/dual card slots or a system that actually works (the way it should) and much better customer service/QC?I will be also getting a 5D mark III which will make the 6D a great companion for wedding work.

I believe if you're doing anything other than studio portrait work, this amount of focus points (especially with only one cross-type) simply isn't enough. Otherwise you have to be a blazing fast recomposer!! At the risk of losing shots or soft images.Don't get me wrong, the IQ out of this camera can be outstanding.

I could get some great pictures out of that camera but clearly was ready to invest in something nicer, particularly for indoors -- while the speed light and getting a custom white balance setting helped, I still didn't love any indoor shots...with 4-6 mos of winter, that's important to me. I researched and hemmed and hawed, and actually decided to buy the Nikon D7100. To my great surprise, I could hardly get a shot from this popular camera that was better than my T2i. In fact, it had way worse noise at higher ISOs, the controls were much more cumbersome and the revolutionary focusing system, well, didn't give me sharp pictures no matter what I did. So, I sent it back and went with my original plan, the 6D. The very first thing I did was shoot indoors with no light and I was shocked at how this camera performed! It will grab the absolute tiniest bit of light available and illuminate beautifully and SHARP! I have pictures with 8000-12600 ISOs that are gorgeous with no editing. The auto white balance is almost dead on: I always had to take a custom white balance shot with the T2i, and haven't had to yet with the 6D. The wireless function is very handy: I shot a picture in RAW, edited it on the camera, connected to my iPhone and emailed it and shared to FB. The recipient replied, \"Wow, this looks like it came out of a magazine.\" Completely bypassing hooking up my external drive, downloading, etc etc was great. The HDR setting for heavily backlit subjects is really fun (but don't move!). I could go on and on, the real reason to get this camera is the image quality, it's just amazing. You can't take a bad picture with it. I've loved the time spent really learning photography with the T2i, and now with my toolbox of go-to techniques, I look forward to getting \"wow\" from picture after picture! The 24-105 is great, and I'll probably add the 70-200 f4L (no IS, since I have a monopod) to take pictures of kid's soccer and my husband's RC airplanes. So far playing around with the 6D, I get exactly what I need for action shots. Don't miss the pop-up flash at all. The handful of times I fill-flashed I didn't really like it anyway. There are several ways to overcome shadows/backlit subjects in this camera and I have absolutely not needed flash indoors at all yet and if so will just use the speed light.

The 7D did feel a bit more secure in my hand and I have fairly average sized hands.  The resell value of a 7D is pathetic.  My 17-40 f4 L lens is nearly a fisheye on the 6D with the full frame.

This camera is an upgrade from my 50D and my first FF digital.  The reviews I scoured prior to purchase identified autofocus as an area of concern, or perhaps just difference between the 6D and the Nikon D600 or 5Diii.  I shoot exclusively with the the centre AF point selected and didn't use the servo function at all.  Not that I was avoiding other settings, it's just my preference.  Everything focused quickly and accurately.  If you're my kind of photographer, don't think twice about the autofocus.The continuous shooting speed also gets a mention in the reviews.  I used this all the time with exposure bracketing as I was curious how the new camera handled exposure.  4.5 fps was absolutely fine.  I didn't shoot weddings or sport.I almost always left the camera on auto ISO but adjusted the ISO speed setting for my likely subjects.  The camera chose rather conservative ISO settings which is excellent.  I must say that despite superior ISO performance, 1600 is still a good maximum for my tastes.I took a 24-105 but rediscovered the 85 f/1.8 which really shines on this camera, probably because of the increased resolution over my old 50D.  It was so sharp that I came home and ordered the 135 f/2, expecting wonderful things.  Still waiting for delivery.  The 24-105 is good, particularly at shorter distances, but I think the 6D loves good glass.Finally, I think this camera handles highlight clipping very, very well.  My 50D clips, my G1X clips (I almost always underexpose this brilliant camera by 1/3) but the 6D just cruised right through those highlights.  I'm thinking of, say, brilliant white yachts or plant leaves that always generate exposure issues for me.  I used to have highlight tone priority turned on all the time with the 50D but the couple of times I used it with the 6D didn't persuade me of its necessity.  There were one or two times when I knew I'd have an issue with highlights andI turned it on. It's effective, but maybe these full frame cameras just handle highlights better.  I guess that's what we're paying for.My only brickbat is the way this camera renders tropical greenery.  Plant's colouring is different in Australia.  Tropical greenery is a bit yellower and the 6D brought out that yellow.  Found myself desaturating the yellows more often thn with my other cameras.  Shooting greenery here in Sydney doesn't create that effect.So I'm really happy to take this camera travelling again.  Low light performance is superior to my crop sensors and resolution is brilliant.  I'm happily cropping to an unheard of degree.

I looked online at bestbuy and found one in stock yesterday 11/30/2012 and picked it up. This is just a quick first impression and i have only spent a couple of hours with the camera. I upgraded from a Canon 60D so the buttons layout is pretty similar.  I will have to say that I am not a fan of the super soft and squishy buttons on this camera.  There just is no confident threshold to tell that you have positively click on a button.They image quality is superb, and low light is what you would expect from a full frame camera. The Af is disappointing if you are coming from a 7d and is similar to the Af on the old  5d mark II.  Canon could have just put the same AF system as the 7D in here and this camera would be a must buy.Menu system is larger but easy to navigate.

I have probably taken 20-30 thousand shots with it and it still is going strong.However - I wanted a full frame sensor camera body and wanted wireless (more to preview pics taken immediately on my nexus 7 tablet than to control my camera)Anyway - after un-boxing - I couldn't believe it. It makes my T2i appear as if it were a toy (as far as build quality + weight + bigger size).There are features that I discovered that will instantly make my photos better. One example - there were times that I would struggle getting my horizon straight while on a side of a hill using a tripod.  This camera has a built in level that is view-able on your LCD screen (during live view), and it turns green when you have it level and its red when it isn't.  I know that's a small thing - but - that's one less thing to do in post processing.There are many other features that come standard on the 6D that I only had available on my T2i after installing Magic-Lantern.Also I love that they give you Photo size options in RAW. With the T2i shooting RAW - you can only shoot LARGE. Although that's how I will shoot a majority of still shots - doing time lapse stuff when you only require HD (1920x1080) that extra size and quality comes with an expense (lots of disk space / memory and processor needs for your PC to process)The GPS is a nice feature - but when you use that and the wireless (or really just the GPS on its own)- it will suck the life right out of the Battery.  So even with these options turned off - I doubt seriously that I'll get half the life from this battery as the T2i gets from its battery.  It was nothing for me to shoot 2000 shots in a single time lapse session (during a 2-3 hour window) on 1 charge.To defend the 6D there is more hardware to drive.  Make sure you get a spare battery.So I have only had this for three weeks now - have taken about 200 test photos and I absolutely like it. Cant wait for better weather and to know that the Sun really does exist.Having said all of this - its the image quality that counts. I haven't taken a photo yet that's made me say wow! And I'm comparing the t2i with the EF-S 18-50mm kit lens to the 6D with the 24-105mm F/4L USM IS lens.  I'm sure I will though. Weather in Ohio in January has been windy cold and dark so far.  I will update this review after more time and better conditions. But still - I am taken back a little because the lens alone cost more than my T2i kit!", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compared with Canon T4i - Really no comparisons", "Author": "Ashish Jain", "ReviewID": "R15XGPQVCW32LC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already own a Canon T4i and T1i, wished to go full frame for some time. I am a amateur with decent skill level and own some of the Canon prime lenses and 430EXii speedlite.Options considered:1) Canon 5D Mark iii - Too costly and big for me but a dream.2) Nikon D800 - Again big and costly. 36 mp...not for me. For some category of people, this could be best of bunch.3) Canon 5D Mii - Already aged and doesn't match the ISO performance of 6D. Again bigger.4) Nikon D600 - Toughest competitor but not convincing enough for me to sell my Canon primes and speedlite. Also, i don't like the colors of Nikon specially for portraits. It offers some advantages over canon - specially higher dynamic range and better color depth. DXO seems to favor it but looks biased. DXO rates it over 6D in ISO, however, everyone else who has tested this and 6D seems to favor 6D for lower noise at same ISO.I will definitely update this review and rating after using it for decent time. My observations so far:Pros:1) Low light and ISO performance - Yes, this is the biggest factor to go full frame and 6D is better than old generation full frames and neck-to-neck with none other than 5DMiii. As per reports, also beating rival Nikon D600 by a small margin. With a canon T4i, i can see considerable noise at ISO 800, this is very clean at 6400. I no longer need to worry about ISO and use faster shutter when required in low light conditions which is must for me as a father of 2 year old.2) Center AF focus point is really great, it can focus in conditions i never imagined with Canon T4i. As per reports, this can focus in some conditions where Nikon D600 fails.3) Kit lens (24-105 F/4) is reasonably good and costly as compared to kit lens that comes with Nikon D600. I would recommend everyone to purchase 6D with kit lens even if you already have one. You can easily sell it for at least $750 (new is over 1K).4) WiFi - Haven't used it yet, will configure this weekend. It is useful in many ways. For me, it would help in framing self-portraits and make-up for lack of vari-angle LCD.5) Light weight - Honestly, this is bigger than what i expected (feel so due to bigger kit lens) but I am still happy because i can't imagine going even bigger with 5DMiii.6) AF micro adjust7) SDHC memory cards instead of CF - I already have 4 SDHC cards (16GB each) which i use across my all cameras. CF cards are costly. I am happy that 6D use SDHC.What i miss:1) Touch-screen - Canon T4i is having a very nice touch screen. If canon had decided to put touch-screen on 6D, prices could have been higher, so no issue here but i really miss it.2) My 18-135mm STM IS lens which i used on T4i: Kit lens with 6D is 24-105mm L F/4 while my 18-135 lens was practically 28.8-216mm (due to 1.6 crop factor) which is very good range on the telephoto side as compared to 105mm. Anyway, this lens can not be compared to image quality of L lens on same focal lengths.Also, STM lens are good for auto-focusing in video on compatible cameras (Read: T4i and new T5i) without recording auto focus sound. On 6D, i must focus manually in order to have decent video.3) Auto white balance on T4i is very good, i never had to use other presets or custom WB. Auto white balance on 6D is little on the warm side (only used so far in average tungsten lit indoor environment), i must play around with WB more often to get colors of my liking and it allows to save just 1 custom WB setting. Even, my P&S; Panasonic gives me option to save 2 custom WB settings. I could be wrong here, its just a few days with me yet. Also, there is no dedicated button for WB :(What i don't care about:1) 97% viewfinder coverage - I can imagine that 3% less can possibly effect 4-5% of my pictures (for my kind of use). With 20 mega-pixels, i don't mind cropping some of my pictures (for my use, there won't be many).2) Built-in flash: Although, I never used popup flash on T4i alone, it has ability to trigger speedlite remotely and i used it frequently to trigger my 430EXii remotely. Now with 6D, i must purchase RF triggers (could be Yongnuo 622C). Although, not having a built-in flash doesn't matter to me, its a deal breaker for many. This is nice-to-have. Anyway, no regrets here, i will be fine with remote triggers which anyway are better than using IR on T4i.3) Only 1 card slot - Good enough for me but could hurt professional/event photographers who use second slot to backup everything as a security against memory card failure.Cons:1) Just 1 cross type AF point - Although, the cross type AF point in center is one of the best ever and it can focus in conditions where many rivals will fail, i am still not happy with Canon's decision not to put more cross type points. I shoot mostly with center point but need better AF system for at least 20% of my need. Being a father of 2 year old who is always in action, i do miss some of the shots. I don't expect an AF system of 7D or 5Dmiii at this price but this could have been better with at least 9 or 11 cross types. Canon's competitor is offering it, why not canon? Now, that is a different story that people are complaining Nikon D600's AF system even when it has so many AF points with many of them being cross-type.Personally, i wouldn't mind paying 100-150 bucks more if Canon had gone ahead with slightly better AF system (more AF points and at least 11 cross types).2) Flash sync speed of 1/180 - Why? My T4i has 1/200... this might not make much difference to many people but when you should be thinking of going ahead of competition (Nikon) by taking it to 1/250, you are going down so that you have reasons to sell 6D Mii in the future?I do a lot of flash photography and know what it means by being limited by lower flash sync speed.3) Video Moire - This is a real issue for videography. Why? Cost is not the reason for it.... Canon, are are protecting 5Dmiii? 5D doesn't need protection, it will always have many takers in professional world. Better you save you a## from Nikon which is already kicking it. And why no stereo microphone? My T4i records a better sound, no.. i don't want to purchase an external microphone at the moment.Conclusion: Despite some of the cons listed above, i am very happy with amazing picture quality and would strongly recommend it but cutting 1 star from review  due to the fact that canon made some compromises for which cost was not really the factor but Canon's greed to sell future upgrades.If you already own a full frame camera and thinking of upgrading to 6D, i would recommend to wait(if you can)for Mark ii version which i believe will come with better AF system and improved video capability.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 05-Aug-13-----------------------------------------------------------------------As promised, i am revising my review after using it 6 months and upgrading 4 stars to 5 stars.I will not repeat what i mentioned earlier, so just the new additions:1) Micro focus adjustment: I have learn to use it and i don't see buying any camera in future without this feature. With proper MFA, some of my lenses have come alive. In my experience, most lens need MFA... may be just a little to achieve maximum sharpness... if you like counting the hair in eye-lashes in portraits.2) I sold the kit lens 24-105 F/4 L for good money and replaced it with Tamron SP 28-75 F/2.8 and couldn't be happier. Don't get me wrong but i didn't like 24-105L for my use and the way i configured my kit. I use 17-40 for wide angles, 50mm & 85mm primes and a telephoto zoom. Needed something to fill the gap for casual outing which could be indoor as well (like a shopping mall) where i didn't like 24-105, else it is good. Recently ordered a 135mm F/2.0 L, waiting for delivery.3) WiFi: Used it for remote triggering. In sunlight, works better than IR remote and greater distance. Really helps in framing self portraits well and reviewing on your smartphone.4) GPS: Seriously, its a nice feature, if you travel a lot and like to Geo tag your pictures, this could be a handy feature. When i purchased the camera, i thought that this is a  useless feature but now i differ. It saves my time in lightroom since i don't need to manually geo tag my pictures (i have a spare battery ;)5) I purchased Yougnuo 622C RF triggers to remotely trigger my speedlites (highly recommend them to everyone). I am not a fan of on camera pop-up flash and never miss its exclusion on 6D. Before 6D, i used crop cameras where my motive of using speedlite was to compensate the noise handling capability of my camera... today with 6D, i use speedlites only for creativity, else its good without speedlite provided that you have good glass for low light.The other benefit i achieve with these triggers is that it compensates for a mere 1/180 flash sync speed of 6D. I can go upto max shutter speed with 1/4000 in HSS mode with my Canon 430 EXII (i have 2 of them).6) Finally, i still feel that AF system could have been better (faster with more cross-type AF points) for action/kids shooting, i find it sometimes lacking when my 2.5 year old is in-action :), although the center AF pint is very sensitive and works wonder in low light.

Would like to add the following:I wish that 6D had a popup flash. Even after having 2 speedlites, i find it inconvenient to carry one so many times. So, i carry 6D with 50mm 1.4 mounted on it but still end up in low light situations where i could have used a popup flash as a fill light, although i am not a fan of popup flash.Current lenses:1) Canon 17-40L F/4.02) Tamron 28-75 F/2.83) Canon 50mm F/1.4  -> I might be replacing it with 35mm 1.4 in future4) Canon 85mm F/1.85) Canon 135mm L F/2.0Sold my 70-300 IS USM non-L, will be adding 70-200L F/2.8 IS ii or 100-400L, not decided yet and don't have will to spend so much at this point of time, waiting for Canon to release Version 2 for 100-400.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply Amazing - Just Amazing", "Author": "Deepak Singh \"Rishi wannabe\"", "ReviewID": "R3256B5KT1A9Q9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am new to this level of camera though I have been a Canon person for more than 30 years, starting with the superb Canon A-1.The one regret I have of this camera is that I cannot blame the camera if my pics come out funny.Mind you, I am using the Canon 24-70 f2.8 L lens as well as the 70-200 f 2.8 lens, so the results obviously need to credit these lenses also, but the ease, functionality, \"feel\" of the camera is fantastic.

The 6D came out at the perfect time as a full frame option. I looked at the 7D, which has an awesome autofocus system and is incredibly fast, but uses the same sensor at the T2i. I do a few paid photography gigs a year, none of which are sports related, so the speed of the 7D just wasn't necessary. I didn't really look at the 5D Mark II very much because of the age of the technology, and the Mark III was just out of my price range.I waited a few months until the hands on reviews came in before making my final decision. I've pretty much come to the same conclusion as everybody else. Great sensor, nice build, nice size, wifi is a nice option, but the autofocus isn't great. It's a slight step up from my T2i, although the center point focusing is much better in low light. ISO performance is pretty amazing, that's where this camera really shines for me.Overall I think this camera is a nice semi-professional step up for photo enthusiasts. Controls are fairly simple and make sense. Coming from a Rebel-series or even the 60D series makes sense. The image quality gets a huge boost with quality glass compared to the crop sensors. But anybody coming from the 7D series will be greatly disappointed by the speed and autofocus. If you can afford the Mark III, get the Mark III.

I understand that stuck pixels are inherent to such sensors and can be dealt with during PP, but the two samples I tried had just too many (and partially visible during short exposures).  On one sample one really large area \"fixed\" itself through - at least I assume - the camera's internal remap, but still too many remained.  My main use for this camera was for low-light and night-time photos (utilizing it's excellent low-noise characteristics), but having that many stuck pixels out of the gate is a deal breaker (especially as they tend to accumulate with age - at least from my experience with other cameras).So a really good camera based on features and build-quality.  But even putting the pixel issue I experienced aside, while it definitely offers better noise control than the APS-C Canon I wanted to replace, for me it did not yield a large enough improvement in image quality (maybe this is more a testament to the quality of the 18MP APS-C sensor).UPDATED 4/23/13: Upgraded to 4 stars.  I tried another sample as my old camera is showing signs of age.  While the issue with hot pixels persists, I decided that the amazing performance at higher ISO is too much of a game changer to be ignored (especially for action shots).  And for longer exposures (> 1/4 sec) that will suffer from hot pixels, the long exposure noise reduction (basically takes a dark frame and subtracts from the first image) does a decent job (but at the cost of doubling your wait time until the next shot...).", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "From 5d mark ii to 6d", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R2SFYAT16PMLDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my update did not post*********I realize now that there is no FEC button on the 6d which is going to be an issue for me because I almost always use a spot metering preflash (star button) over people's face to nail correct exposures using bounce flash, and use the FEC button with the rear wheel to adjust according to skin tones (+1 for white people, -1 for dark skin, etc). While I've been able to make the \"set\" button on the 6d a FEC button, the FEC amount still shows up on the LCD screen instead of in the viewfinder, so you'll have to take your face away from the camera for a second. I'm sure I can work with this annoyance, but I'm pretty disappointed that canon took this button away from a camera that costs almost $2,000 (while the 7d has it and costs less). I guess they have to make you wish it was a 5d mark iii. Luckily, I still have my 5d ii so I'll probably end up using that more often when I'm using flash. Or maybe it won't be as bad as it seems it's going to be, and everything will be alright. I just wanted to make it apparent that this button is missing, and no matter what you do, you have to change the FEC on the LCD screen, not in the viewfinder. I'm leaving a 5 star rating because I'm still happy with the camera; the image quality is superb.********************I will be updating this review over time. I shoot mostly weddings and I have been using two canon 5d mark ii bodies, and just sold one to get this 6d. I have kept the other one, however. I will start by stating the obvious:The canon 5d mark ii is a great camera, even 4 years after it became available. In fact, it was so good when it came out that it still holds up to many of the brand new camera bodies that are out now, in terms of its sensor.I decided to buy this 6d to replace one of the 5d ii's I have after a friend sent me an ISO 6400 raw. At first it didn't seem any better, but it is, a little bit. In fact, it's just  enough better than 6400 on the 5d mark ii for me to consider using it without hesitation. I've shot at 6400 with the 5d ii many times at weddings in situations where I didn't have a choice, and while it worked, the photos had to be heavily noise reduced and I only provided them at 2 megapixels to my clients. At 6400 on the 5d ii, there is noticeable color loss and dynamic range loss. You must get the exposure right because you cannot manipulate the file much without getting some intense noise and banding. The 6d file at 6400, however, gives you some room to play. You can correct exposures much more without ruining the photo, it retains better colors, and the noise is just a hair better- that is, in a scene with mostly black. In a brightly lit scene, the 6d's noise is substantially better, about one stop, maybe a little less.In video mode, it's a different story. Iso 12800 on the 6d in video looks like 3200 on the 5d ii, no kidding. I don't know how they did this but it's pretty amazing. I don't do much video work though.The 5d mark ii has a preferable button layout, which has been retained in the 5d iii. The 6d's layout are more rebel like and obnoxious, but I'll get used to it. I miss the joystick, as the directional pad on the 6d requires you to shift your hand, and it's pretty mushy.The 1/4000 shutter speed on the 6d would have been a deal breaker to me if I did not own a 5d ii as well, because using wide aperture primes during the day at 1/4000, is just not going to happen. At f1.4, I am often in 1/8000 territory, and some times I have to drop to iso 50 on top of that if using f1.2. the 1/200 strobe sync on the 5d ii is better than the 1/180 on the 6d, as well, and yes it matters.Build quality wise, there is no comparison. The 5d ii wins hands down. The 6d feels identical to a 60d, in my opinion. I'm careful with my gear so this is not a problem.Now to the AF system: I thought there would be no real improvement here, as it's the same crappy focus diamond canon loves to give to us unless we spend over 3k. Well, I was wrong, it's better, much better. I'm used to having to use the center point all the time and the center point on the 6d (rated tofocus at -3 EV vs -0.5 EV on the mark ii) is amazing. A few test shots outside in the city at night revealed perfect focus every time in almost total darkness. This will definitely be helpful in shooting weddings, since most of them are in caves.some other things to note; the 6d has silent shooting modes while the 5d mark ii can only do them in live view mode. Unfortunately the 5dii sounds like a gunshot during a quiet wedding ceremony, so the 6d will for sure be my main body during ceremonies. It's whisper quiet with silent shooting enabled.Last, the overall sharpness is better on the 6d, but it's not bad on the 5d ii at all. This is to be expected from a sensor that's in a brand new body vs one that's 4 years old. The 6d also does in camera lens correction which is very, very nice.So is it worth the extra price for the 6d over the 5d ii if you're looking for a first time full frame? Or is it worth switching from a 5d ii like I did?Maybe. It depends on what you shoot. If you shoot video, and do so in the dark often, absolutely. The 6d video noise is superior, by about two full stops, but only in the higher ISO range. Lower ISO is identical.If you do mostly studio work and outdoor portraiture: No. Save yourself 500 dollars or so and buy a used 5d mark ii. That money is best used elsewhere. 5d ii has better shutter durability and build quality, which will be more important to you. Lower ISO's look exactly the same as well.If you shoot weddings: Yes. The 6d does a better job in low light, and medium light shooting without flash. ISO 3200 is usable on the 5d ii, and 6400 if you really have to. But I'd go to 6400 and not even worry about it wiht the 6d. The -3 EV center point will be very helpful as well, though not as much as the 5d mark iii's autofocus system that frees you from ever having to focus and recompose again.In summary: if most of your shooting is ISO 3200 and below - save some money and pick up a used 5d mark ii. Canon just had refurbs on sale for $1400. I sold mine, with a canon battery grip, for $1400. You get more for your money. If you really need the slightly better low light performance, get the 6d.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Cinematographer's take: Epic Low Light Performance", "Author": "Drew", "ReviewID": "R2UKDBEMZDSY6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using Canon 60d's for a couple years to shoot commercials, weddings, short films and educational films and have found the 60d more than up to the task. I have always been interested in \"moving up\" to full frame cameras, specifically the Canon 5d Mark III. However, I simply couldn't justify the price of the upgrade for the difference in image quality - the 60d's were good enough.After watching at least 10 reviews of the Canon 6d online, I realized that if the ISO tests were accurate, this camera would make every one of my lenses (except my 17-55mm 2.8 IS EF-S lens, which doesn't fit on a full frame sensor) that much brighter. Not only that, but the DXOmark tests revealed that the Canon 6d was the strongest sensor in Canon's stable, even better than the 5d Mark III. I know that the moire in video tests has proved less than stellar, but honestly, its so rarely an issue in what I film.Having been disappointed in upgrades to products over the years, I was hesitant to by the 6d, thinking it was only incrementally better than a 60d. I was wrong.After ISO 1600 the 60d is basically unusable, and even at ISO 1600 you're getting noisy. My tests today with the 6d reveal that at ISO 12800 you have about the same image quality IF NOT SLIGHTLY BETTER than a 60d at ISO 1600.That means that in a dark room, footage on your 6d is usable. What more can I say? This camera is worth every penny.

I come from two prior canon bodies, the XS for 4 years and the T4i for one year.It took me a long time to decide between the Nikon D610, the sony A7 and this one. I finally when with this camera mostly because of my prior lenses and flash I had for my other canons, and I don't claim to compare this one to the two others. I read plenty of reviews comparing all three and for those who are looking for a comparison here you might as well google more professional reviews than mine.The bottom line for me after reading all the reviews was that these were great cameras producing great images, therefore, since I had already accessories, I went with Canon.Concerning my needs and why the need to upgrade from the T4i to this one was low light shooting indoors of my one year old. I was very unsatisfied with the low light capabilities of the T4i and the iso at 1600 looked too noisy for me. Otherwise, it was a great camera that served me well.Now, to the camera.Since I said low light was an issue for me, I took the camera and immediately snapped picture of my living room with no flash. It was dark enough and the auto iso went to 12800. I thought, Ok, it will probably be terrible but let's try. When I looked on my 27\" screen at the result I was surprised. The picture was noisy sure but it was comparable to the results I got from my T4i at 1600 iso.So from there I started expecting great things from this camera and therefore I was disappointed rather quickly.I started using the kit lens which is an L lens and theoretically should be very good, but I found my 50 mm 1.4 produced way nicer images indoors. Outdoors, the 24-105 mm produced great images and proves obviously more versatile, I guess it's unfair to compare both these lenses since the 50 mm 1.4 is such a great lens anyways. But, in my mind, I thought an L lens should be way better than a cheap 50 mm that I got on amazon for $290.Now, the wifi and GPS.I have tried using the GPS, and I'm sure it can be helpful, but after I saw it draining my battery in one day while on standby, I just turned it off and decided to turn it on only when needed (like when traveling). The problem with this is that I went to DC took nearly a thousand pictures and forgot that it was off. Therefore, no geotagging for the whole trip (Granted, I can add that info later since I know where the pics were taken, but you get catch my drift). So I don't like how the GPS stays on when your turn off the camera, this really limits battery life. When turned off, my battery lasts for days.The Wifi is arguable more useful, and the iPhone app is quite easy to use. However, I have had problems connecting to it using the camera as a router. It proved a little bit finicky where I would find it in the wireless networks but then it would disappear just when I connected to it. Weird, I'm probably doing something wrong here. Otherwise, when I connect the camera to my home network, My iPhone finds it and takes pictures and everything, no problems.I have not used it much though and I still need to find a smoother way to use it to automatically import my pictures into iPhoto. Currently, when it imports them it puts each picture in a new event, creating mayhem in my library. I have tried the eyefi card before on my T4i and it imported automatically with very little effort on my part and it kept my library well organized. Again, this is software issue but after tinkering with it for a while I couldn't solve that problem so for now I just pop my SD into my IMac, it's faster anyways.HandlingThe camera is quite large compared to my two previous bodies, so for me I felt this is the heaviest camera I have ever used. So I know how this is advertised as the smallest full frame DSLR in the world, but to me, and many people like me, we won't get to feel this way because we are coming from the opposite direction, from cropped sensors and point and shoot. However, despite it being large (again all is relative in this world) it didn't bother me much even when I have my Speedlite 430 EX II, as long as I don't carry it around my neck for a while. It's heavy enough that I actually carry it on my hand and in my bag most of the time as opposed to the XS or T4i where I could keep them for an hour or two with no problems around my neck. So for people looking at buying a small therefore light to travel camera, you need to realize that it is still a heavy camera, especially with the 24-105 mm attached to it! When I put the 50 mm on, it actually is way lighter and more friendly to my neck, but then you lose on versatility.The buttons, dials, wheel are easy to use and self explanatory. Since I am not a pro photographer, I can't really comment on what's missing and how it affects workflow, for me, it works quite well and is ergonomic enough.Picture qualityThat's why you get a large sensor right? I was disappointed initially because I didn't get the mind blowing images right off the bat. This is when I realized that this camera needs more knowledge to make a good picture than before. I admit I used the auto modes on my other cameras, and on this one I decided to use it mostly manual and aperture priority. So getting all the settings, exposure, aperture, shutter speed, iso etc, right is very important. When I get them right, I get outstanding pictures. However, I feel that there is a learning curve and obviously this camera can deliver great quality, I just need to work harder to get them from it.Also interesting, when talking about learning how to use it, is when I give it to my friends and ask them to take pictures for me. I just want to delete all their pictures since I find them terrible. My friends obviously have not a lot of photographic backgrounds and just use their cell phones. But again, to re emphasize the point that if you don't know how to take pictures, this camera will just make your terrible pictures larger and expose your incompetence. So you need to work hard and read about photography to really get the images this camera can produce.Now, the best part about this camera is the low light performance. I now routinely push the ISO to 1600, and I know my images will still be sharp and well exposed. The images are very good up till 10 000 iso, and some say usable at 12800. I have not tried 25600, but I bet they won't be that great. So I am very happy with that part, especially that most of the time I am taking pictures of my kid running around the house where lighting is not that great. Paired with my speedlite 430, I produce great images. (remember to bounce the flash of a wall to avoid the harsh shadows)Autofocus.Lot's of talk about the lack of points. But I came from the T4i, so it was still an upgrade for me. Since I use the camera in aperture priority most of the time, I also use the center point for focus 99% of the time. This works very well for still subjects. However, a one year old is rarely still and this is where my 24-105 mm with a max aperture of 4 fails sometimes miserably. When I pair it with my 50 mm, I get more consistent results of my running kid, but it still takes some effort to do so. I was expecting a little bit more forgiveness from the camera. Apparently I need to work more on getting a faster shutter rate, which means pushing my ISO higher which I don't really like to do even if the results are still outstanding.I have not tried the 5D mark III but now I'm curious.I will probably update this review at a later time when I figured out more of how to get more consistent results from this camera.Since I still feel that I didn't get everything that I wanted (maybe because of my own ignorance of how to use it) I gave it a 4 star review. This might change in the future.The bottom line is this is a great camera than can produce great images, but it needs some serious effort on the photographer's part (which I guess is normal)", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "There is nothing more annoying when...", "Author": "Discerning Buyer", "ReviewID": "R3HZIPEH6UQAC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...reviews are filtered through the lens of the prices paid by the writers. More money means better camera right? In my opinion, not always. I am writing this from the perspective of a 5D Mark ii owner. An owner who when they first made the move to full frame was blown away with the shots I made. But alas, here we are in 2013 and times have changed and I need to upgrade because it is just time. I think back to the excitement of reading information pre-launch of the 5D Mark iii and 6D and was immediately having tech upgrade envy. I can't tell you how many times I said to myself. Yeah I have problems with that in the Mark ii. I need those 61 focusing points, I need the additional pixels too, etc etc! Then I realized some things. I do not take pictures of speed boats or sporting events. In fact, I don't take pictures of flying birds or jets either. In addition, I frame my photos the way I want them and rarely if ever crop. That being said, I will reduce this down to a simple question that I asked myself and one that I am sure others will say is too simplistic. What camera fits your photographic niche... your needs? For me, that is the 6D. For me this is not an \"entry level\" full-frame camera, this is a choice that I made from a set of options. BTW I could easily have afforded the 5D Mark iii if you needed to know that. To term the 6D an entry level full frame camera is a marketing trick which puts the technology on a linear scale which it is not. Let me further break what my needs and wants were down for you. I am a low light photographer and no I don't do weddings or sporting events. I take most of my images at night. I generally use available light and only when absolutely necessary use a flash. I am responsible and switch cards frequently. I travel extensively. I don't want to have to always whip out a cable and my laptop when I am already carrying tons of gear. I need better focusing especially in low light. I make photos with long exposures.For me the 6D is my camera of choice and the best camera because of these reasons and for my reasons. The 6D surpasses the 5D Mark iii on my high priority needs. This makes it the better camera for me. And let me tell you something else, in comparison to the 5D Mark ii in one word... amazing. Is it an upgrade to the 5D Mark ii? Absolutely on many levels. Is there anything I wish I could pull out of the 5D Mark iii and make a part of the feature list of the 6D? You mean like raw HDR in camera instead of just JPG? Yes. Is that the only thing? Yep, pretty much sums it up! How to make the right decision between the 5D Mark iii and the 6D?

The reason I say that is up until I went full frame, I always felt like I wasn't experiencing the full benefits of my lenses, mainly my 35mm 1.4L.  The additional wide angle look that you get gives a much more cinematic look at times and it really is a noticeable difference, even when looking through the viewfinder.Second, the low light capabilities on this bad boy are amazing.  I do a lot of indoor videography, and at times, mostly in low light situations.  At times with the 60D when I used to stress about the lighting situation, now with the 6D, I just jack up the ISO without much thought and get amazingly usable footage.  I've done a ton of research prior to my purchase and the low light capabilities of this camera actually beat the MarkIII.  I cannot stress how much easier it is to manage low light situations with this camera.Lastly, Canon introduced new shooting modes called ALL-I and IPB.  ALL-I is a higher quality format that creates a separate individual frame for each frame footage as opposed to IPB which only records the changes in between frames.  ALL-I also takes up about 3x more space than IPB does.  I've done some tests and while I can't notice a huge difference, it's great to have the option to either save space, or have better quality footage.This doesn't mean that this camera doesn't have it's imperfections.The lack of a swivel screen almost was a deal breaker for me.  The freedom the 60D gave me with that one technical feature was appreciated, and ever more so now without one on the 6D.  I don't know why they would leave that out.The lack of audio monitoring is also another one.  It almost seems as though they aimed this camera at budget conscious full frame videographers but left out this one small but crucial feature.I've learned to work around these two issues and have accepted that I saved over $1400 by not going with the MarkIII which even stil doesn't have the swivel screen but does have audio monitoring.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "David J Perez", "ReviewID": "R1J0DOPU3QOYY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously owned a 10D, purchased in 2004.

I would say, yes, depending on where you are upgrading from. If you are coming from a Rebel series Canon camera like the T3i/T4i and looking to make the next jump up, the price for a full frame sensor just fell dramatically and you will be in love with this camera. If you currently are using a 5D Mark II, it's a tough sell as you are in another category of camera, and the 6D is only a marginal improvement over an existing 5D Mark II - unlike a 5D Mark III which is a pretty big improvement over the Mark II in a few key areas for wedding photographers (AF, Dual Slots, ISO, etc). For a wedding photographer, this camera would be a great choice for a second body at a great price compared to getting a 2nd 5D Mark III. With both cameras having the new DiGiC 5+ processor, the files come out very similar to one another and are easier to match colors while editing which is a huge bonus when you have thousands of wedding photos to go through (and a giant relief for video where color matching is a bit trickier). As a video camera I feel like it's a solid choice, and wedding videographers in particular will love this camera. The full frame sensor and ISO sensitivity mean you can still get a very usable image in dark settings, and unless you shoot a lot of outdoor wedding videos (Indian weddings for us are typically in hotels or banquet halls), you will appreciate this feature a lot! That said, the much cheaper Canon 60D (that's six-zero) which the 6D is based on does have these similar features (30 minute movies) for a much cheaper price just with a crop sensor inside and a bit less ISO performance, and would still make an excellent video camera. Overall, I would say this camera definitely gets a big thumbs up from me, getting a full frame camera with amazing ISO sensitivity for under 2 grand is a big deal and for our specific needs of dimly lit indoor weddings that is worth the premium over Canon's other recent crop-sensor cameras.

It is such a huge upgrade over the 7D.  When I process my pictures and look closely at them the difference is staggering.  On my old 7D I would have to mess with white balancing all the time, the 6D is spot on every time left on auto white balancing.

I think it is really important to rent such a piece of equipment before investing $1700 - $2000 on it. So far, it has not disappointed. I come from a family of crop bodies. I started off in my early days with the XSI. I later upgraded to the T1i, T3i, and 7D. All were improvements of their older siblings. Here are my first impressions of the 6D.PROS:1.) Feel - I read countless reviews saying this was a lightweight camera. In terms of the size, yes it is. Only my XSI is about the same size. My 7D dwarfs it after the battery grip is attached. However, this thing feels solid! The dials are amazing and smooth. The shutter release button is very smooth. I don't think I ever get tired of hearing that shutter sound.2.) Button layout - They hit the nail on the head with this one. Less is more in this case. I never use the LCD screen on top of the body. I always use the menu on the screen to change options. It is just a force of habit. I am not a fan of the ISO button. It is in the center of the LCD panel. I am used to having that button stand out. The added button to lock the mode dial is a great welcome.3.) Viewfinder - It is bright and awesome. Enough said....4.) ISO Performance - Immediately upon getting the camera, I cranked the ISO to 6400. I would NEVER dream of shooting at that ISO with my crop bodies. When I opened up the file in PhotoShop to remove noise, I was blown away. The noise at 100%, on a 5,000 pixel wide image was equivalent to what I see at ISO 400 on a CROP camera. That is nothing! I was finally able to shoot my son in our living room without using the Speedlite. It was a welcome change.5.) Auto ISO - I shot a sunset with it at auto ISO. It never got higher than 5,000 ISO. I didn't need a tripod. If you are savvy in PhotoShop, you can eliminate what little noise there is. I will be using the auto feature a lot.6.) GPS/WiFi - enough has been mentioned. Great features, but battery hogs. I do like the option to send RAW preview to iPad. I will use that this weekend when I shoot some family photos.7.) Built in level - I haven't heard this one mentioned too much. On the back of the LCD screen, there is a level for when you're tripod shooting. This saves up to 10 minutes in post processing having to straighten out horizons that sometimes are at angles. I was using that all morning on the tripod. Just level the head and just adjust the leg height.CONS:1.) RAW file compatibility: Do not be mislead. Only the NEWEST PhotoShop CS6, Lighroom4, PhotoShop Elements 11, and the newest Aperture will read the 6D's raw files. I use CS5. So, does that mean I have to go buy a new version of PhotoShop? No, you have two options here. The first is to use Canon's Digital Photo Professional to open your RAW files and export them to PhotoShop. This process is long and it drains resources. The second option is download the newest version of Adobe DNG Converter. It is a quick process that will take your .CR2 files and make them a .DNG. It compresses the file a tiny bit, but there is NO IMAGE QUALITY LOSS. Now I can use my version of PhotoShop to edit my shots.2.) Battery life - it isn't 700 shots as advertised. I got maybe 500 without using any of the GPS/WiFi functions and not using the LCD screen for previewing. I will get a battery grip.3.) Weight - This a heavy camera. Do not be fooled by the lightweight comments. Compared to beasts such as the 7D and 5DIII, yes, it is light. But after carrying it all day with my 100-400 telescope attached, my shoulders and hands were fatigued.4.) Ergonomics - The small size is also a bad thing. My hands are strained a bit when I grip to press the button. I will have to use the battery grip just so I can have a better feel when shooting with it.You cannot go wrong with this camera. I have only been shooting with it for 24 hours as of now, but I feel like I have been shooting with it for years.

I don't think the 5D is necessarily \"better\" than the 6D.For my purposes, the 6D is simply a more suitable choice. Comparing the two, the 6D is smaller and lighter. The center AF point is more sensitive. I'm able to change the focus screen on the 6D to help me manually focus more easily. I love that the 6D is so similar to my previous camera the 60D so that I didn't have to adjust to a new layout.Needless to say, the image quality is far more superior than my 60D. The low light capability allows me to use ISO 3200 or 6400 without hesitation. I even used 12800 and the result was still decent enough to be useable. For my taste my 60D could only go as high as 1600, 3200 if there's absolutely no choice. That's two stops of improvement already. Combined with my sigma 35 art at 1.4, I could easily take pictures of my two-year-old son in indoor setting. One time I was in a dark church I had to use ISO 12800 with my 135L set at F2 in order to capture a man praying. There's absolutely no way I could capture anything close with a cropped sensor.Some people complain about the AF system of the 6D. It's true that it's not state-of-the-art. A lot of times I use the center point. Even my friend who has a 5Dmk3 consistently uses center point to focus. It's simply easier and faster. The only time it won't work well is when you have to take a portrait of someone with a large aperture at a relatively close distance. For example if I use my 135L at f2 and I'm 10 ft away from my subject, my depth of field is only about 2.3 inches. So center focusing and recomposing won't work because as you recompose the focal plan is probably behind your subject already. I find that the other points of the 6D are not as terrible as many people claim. It seems that the other points are useable if I use large aperture f1.4, f2 lenses.Do I wish I had mk3's AF system? Absolutely! i drool over it. Do I need it? Probably not. For landscape I'm fine using manual focus or center point because the depth of field is so forgiving. For portrait I'm fine using outer points. Or I use the center point but leave plenty of room such that I can crop the picture to a better composition in post.The 5Dmk3 is probably a more suitable camera for someone who shoots wedding and action, or someone who's able to afford. For everybody else the 6D is good enough. I based my decision purely on value, and return on investment. Camera price, unlike lenses, depreciates extremely fast. I wanted to get the most affordable full frame and use it to its fullest extent to make my investment worthwhile. AF is one area the 5D wins. For me personally that kind of AF is useful probably only 5% of the time. For the extra money I'd very much rather buy a lens instead of being tied up to an expensive camera that I know will depreciate fast in a matter of 2-3 years.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent image quality for a reasonable price.", "Author": "El polizonte", "ReviewID": "R1TPGCHWYNO305", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great image quality for a very reasonable price - this is my light weight, general photography/vacation camera, that paired with a Canon lens  EF 50mmm f1.4 USM, covers family events, landscape, and is small in size and lightweight for a good price.

I was looking for a full frame camera to replace a 50D, and I was considering this against the 5D Mark III.  For me, the differences that mattered were the WiFi and GPS, along with the substantial savings against the 5D.  I use the camera for family pictures and hobby photography.  The 5D is an incredible camera, but this one blended features and price in a way that provided the most value.  I was worried that not having a flash would be a problem, but the low-light capabilities of this camera are incredible.  I tend to prefer primes, so I'm normally using fast lenses, and this has already captured some nice photos.Moving from a 1.6x censor to full frame has thrown me for a bit of a loop - my previous lens of choice was the 50mm 1.4.  In full frame, the 50mm is a bit too loose, so I'm looking at 85mm options.  I also use the 135mm, and it's very good.  My next lens will be the 100mm 2.8L, and based on some tests, I'm expecting that to be the sweet spot for me.While I scratch the surface of this camera's capability, the controls are consistent from one Canon to another, and I didn't have much of a learning curve from the 50D to this.I highly recommend this camera; so far it has been fantastic.Update - 06/21/13I wanted to post a quick amendment to my earlier post relative to battery life. While I continue to be thrilled with the camera, I ran into a substantial problem on battery life. I prefer to use a battery pack / grip, so I run two rechargeable batteries simultaneously. I turned on the GPS and WiFi functions, and even with the camera off, the batteries were completely drained in three days. Apparently one or both of those functions continue to pull from the battery even while the camera is off. To me, this is a pretty big liability. I'll try to isolate whether its the GPS or WiFi that drains the batteries so fast, but if I have to continually cycle through turning these functions on, then off, I think that would be a pretty big problem. I don't know why the GPS would continue to function while the camera is off; maybe it provides value to someone more technical than me, but I don't see the value.

I would have gotten a 5d mark iii, but I couldn't justify the price difference for my needs.Stills wise, this camera is awesome. ISO performance is the really big plus on this camera and coming from a crop frame it's changed the way I shoot. It also has a small form factor for a full-frame.Auto focus isn't blazing fast, but it should prove fine for anything besides sports or other fast-moving objects.The auto focus points are highly concentrated in center of the frame. I often find myself wanting them closer to rule of thirds points.The one huge downside for video users is the moire issue. I find that some moire comes in for clothes with tight patterns, but in most instances the footage is still usable and only a trained eye will notice it.Things with very tight patterns (metallic outside grill of a window A/C) produce really wonky moire issues. Odd magenta colors come in and the moving pattern is rapid and noticeable even to the untrained eye.There is a solution to the moire issue. Mosaic Engineering makes an anti-aliasing filter that sits between the lens and the sensor. I haven't used it myself, but there are videos online that show its effectiveness. Filter goes for $365, still much less for body and filter than 5d Mark III. Filter should be removed when shooting stills, which is a downside if you are switching between the two.On the upside for video, auto focusing during liveview has definitely improved over the years on Canon DSLRs. Not as fast as mirrorless, but much better than previous SLRs.Also, no headphone jack. Don't know why Canon wouldn't include one, but I'm guessing it's to protect the 5d mark iii.WiFi and GPS are fun. First WiFi set-up takes a few minutes, but it pairs quickly for subsequent uses. Shooting from a phone can be a lot of fun and it will draw some surprised reactions from friends. Transfer also works quickly and files can be JPEGs or RAW, but it will only transfer a JPEG copy to your phone.DLNA also works fine. Haven' tested other modes yet.GPS is nice, but it does drain the battery pretty quickly. Unless you have a reason to track where you took pics, it's probably best to leave it off.Bottom line: Great for stills, unless you shoot a lot of sports. Video is good, but you have to be mindful of avoiding objects that produce moire (or just buy the filter).", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera at a very resonable price.", "Author": "Kevin Danjou \"360o`phile\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z3EQ3ZCQH71S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Great Canon build qualityVery extensive menus and featuresGreat handling and ease of useWonderful low light sensitivity for center auto focus pointGreat ISO sensitivity with usable prints at 12800Cons:Only one cross type AF sensor (center), would have preferred more (minor quibble)Buffer for RAW + JPG is limited to 10 imagesBatteries from 3rd parties dont seem workShutter Speed tops out at 1/4000th of a secondDoesn't slice bread....Background:I have multiple Canon DSLR bodies including EOS-1D, EOS-1Ds and 40D with multiple L lenses.  Used to shoot professionally (medium format - film), now just shooting for myself.I decided on this camera to take to WDW in Orlando in January of 2014.  The decision was based on wanting a smaller and more powerful camera to take than my 1Ds with higher ISO sensitivity.  This camera certainly impressed with the allowed options.  It fits well in the hand, is reasonably light and even with a BG-13 attached for extended battery life and portrait controls.  For the price of 1499 from Amazon, it was too good to pass up.Camera was shipped promptly and without issue.The camera is FAST to start up and be ready to take pictures.  Focusing with any Canon lens I used was snappy and accurate.  All controls worked as expected and while I miss the joystick that is on the 40D, the 8 position pad on the back was accurate and I found no issues using it like those I had read in other amateur and professional reviews.  I do like all the buttons on the right side, accessible from the thumb, its a good control layout.  The Q button is taking a little bit to get used to, but it's a decent learning curve.Image quality:This is a full frame sensor that's 20+ MP.  That's a lot of digital real estate.  The images are sharp, balanced, and provide great color rendition before using any post processing.  Colors using the auto WB seems the most true and were never glaringly wrong.  ISO Noise is something to behold.  I was able to shoot up to 12800 and get VERY usable images from them.  While you will see grain in your images if you are doing a very tight crop, for most monitors you will get very good rendition and grain is easily controlled with post processing in Lightroom or Canon DPP.Auto focus in low light:Simply superb!  I shot on anything from a 50mm f1.4, thru a 24-105mm F4 and 70-200mm F4 lens with very little issue with getting good focus in low light.Features:Little things like a locking mode button are very nice to have.  The menu's are very snappy and having wi-fi capability at your fingertips is wonderful when your wife wants to post pictures of her and Winnie the Pooh to Facebook from her iPhone.  The custom menu option to turn WiFi on and off allows essential functions you want to be handy instead of hunting.  Wifi relatively easy to setup once you understood the process.  Bringing pictures over and controlling the camera is also snap from the free Canon App.Silent shooting modes are a snap to get to and do provide a very very quite shutter experience.  I'm under know illusion that it will be a quiet as a leaf shutter, but compared to an 1D, 1Ds, and 40D it is VERY quiet.The cons:These are minor things that I noticed after putting 3000 cycles on the camera after a weeks shooting.  These apart or as a whole would not keep me from buying another 6D if something happened to my current one.  Having read extensively about the camera these are my take on them:There is only one cross type sensor on the camera (my 40D has 11!), however the center sensor is VERY sensitive (a definitely plus) and as I prefer to shoot of the center sensor for verifying my focus point, and then recompose the image, this wasn't a huge issue.  I did shoot some automatic using all AF points and focusing was accurate.The buffer for images seems a bit small for such a large sensor and the acceptance that many many people will capture RAW and JPGs at the same time.  When doing bracketed exposures with 5 images in each set, you run out of buffer pretty quickly. (For non-HDR purposes, but to get a varied number of exposures in difficult lighting situations)  I would have preferred a larger one as it seems it's gotten only large enough to keep a similar buffer size to my EOS-1Ds even though the file sizes are much larger.I did find in the high sun of the day the need to close my f stop down a bit just to keep from topping out my shutter speed when shooting my 135mm F2L at ISO100.  Granted 1/8000 get's only one more stop, but in some cases it would be nice.  I feel ultimately that the slower shutter speed is a requirement of the extra extra quiet shutter of the 6D.Overall:  This camera works VERY well with 24-105 F4L IS USM lens. (You can get them as a kit)  The camera is lacking a few features of it's bigger brother the 5D, such as HDR RAW processing.  However the sensitivity of the sensor and processor are on par with it's sibling.  You are losing 2 MP of information, but getting higher ISO sensitivity and clarity in low light images.  I was able to buy the 6D from Amazon for LESS than half the price of the 5D Mark III today.

The fact that this camera can be had for $1600-$1800 range, shoots ALL-I, is a full-frame camera and is $1500 less than the 5DMKIII--this is a no-brainer. The 5DMKIII is a beautiful camera--but it also has issues. The process used to \"reduce\" moire in camera gives you a slighting less sharp picture in our testing. Once again, no camera is perfect. Love the 6D so much--the only thing Canon needs to do is start adding articulated lcds on their pro cameras--thats what is so great about cameras like the 60D.

I personally don't mind that the 6D doesn't have the fold out screen since I rarely used it on the T4i anyway. I do miss the touch screen however.The full frame advantage of the 6D at this price is awesome. I still use the T4i for most of my telephoto work since a crop camera provides a much longer work area. I also sometimes use the T4i for my macro work when I want a tighter shot. BUT the low light shooting ability of the 6D and the much brighter viewfinder will knock your socks off! The 6D is a low light king! The 6D's ability to shoot with lowlight and it's noise level at a minimum is simply outstanding... it outperforms all present competitors! The ISO performance is far beyond the T4i also.One reason I don't think the 6D even needs a foldout screen is because the ability to use iPhone or iPad as a control is really nice. Also the software that comes with the kit makes it possible to control the camera from a wifi connected laptop also. The GPS stamping is also top notch... and the mapping software is really nice.The feel of the 6D is also quite similar to the T4i being only a bit heavier but the weather seal on the 6D is an advantage also.So, all in all ....

Throwback bodies are cool a la the new Sony A7 and similar Fujis and Nikons. Hold them, though, and you'll miss the 6Ds familiar yet compacted approach to body/interface as well as its EF lens selection.Only newbies measure a camera's worth in megapixels, and I find that the 6D's smaller 20mp contributes to features of superior performance as well as more efficient RAW data storage. It's full frame, too, so image quality is truly outstanding.The image and video quality is outstanding. On par if not better than a 5DIII. Moire is not bad like people say and in fact I have never noticed it.The body is really comfortable and the dials are exactly where they should be.The 24-105 is a beast. It's built like a tank and sharp as heck. Definitely spend the $500 and get it with the camera.I like the camera best with primes such as the 40 2.8 pancake or the 50 1.8 nifty fifty, especially the pancake for its compactness and diminished intimidation to subjects. It's very light and portable with any prime.I like the menus at the Q button. You can map everything just how you want.I'm just now discovering P mode and it is actually incredible if not revolutionary.Low light is ridiculously good. I shot a dance party and went flashless for a while at 20k ISO. Noise was barely detectable and color reproduction from the light show was very interesting. The noise reduction does more harm than good though. It blurs things and the 6D is so good that you don't even need it.The autofocus is indeed less fancy than almost any camera I've used in recent years. But, the way I shoot was learned on older cameras anyway, so I don't require a zillion AF points. I prefer the classic crosshair/diamond with a strong AF point in the center. Often times I lock onto the subject and hold focus with the AF OFF button while I compose the shot. Said center cross-type is actually better than anything one on the 5DIII and can focus in near darkness. If you get confused or annoyed with the growingly impersonal and hyper technological modern AF in cameras, the 6D is for you.Philosophy of the 6D (the reason why its always misunderstood by tech oriented geeks).The Canon 6D brings modern tech to classic shooting technique in a way that keeps the photographer involved. This contrasts it to the growing use of automatic functions and button layouts that disengaged the photographer, thus letting the art take a backseat to the camera's techno-intelligence. The 6D wants you to use it like a camera instead of a smart phone with a big lens attached like so many other cameras do (See: Nikon d5300). It's a real camera in form and encourages it to be used as such. You could take the 6D back in time and a photographer would find semblance to the original SLRs.There are a lot of 6D haters and people that don't consider it and I believe that is because they don't understand the philosophy stated above. Thosewho just love to shoot photos with their own skills rather than letting tech do their job always love it.  It's 100% the best value full frame you can get.

Right now, I'm shooting a lot of high school football and I've been using the dedicated sports mode (and it's very odd for me to shoot in any fully auto mode).

I\u2019m an advanced amateur and use the following Canon lenses: 70-200mm f/4L, 50mm f/1.4, 24-105mm f/4L and 17-40 f/4. I don\u2019t use the camera for video and can offer no comments on that function so there is no need to read further if video is your main interest.OVERALLI guess the bottom line question is if I had it to do all over would I still buy the 6D? The answer is In a heartbeat! I'd be surprised if there is a camera on the market capable of producing better quality images. The 6D is well built, very customizable and the controls are user friendly. I'm sure a very granular analysis will find faults and there are good reasons other cameras cost more but if I can't produce eye popping images with this camera the problem isn't the equipment.BUYING THE CAMERAI purchased the 6D with kit lens from Amazon using my Amazon Visa Signature Card. This credit card (1) doubles the Canon warranty on both the camera and lens at no cost (2) gives you 90 days to return the equipment to VISA provided it works and isn\u2019t damaged. Most people don\u2019t know about these benefits. Call VISA for full details but I can tell you from experience they are very easy to deal with if you have problem.MISC INFOAdobe Lightroom has not been updated for the 6D as of this writing (Dec 12, 2012) so it can\u2019t read the RAW files. Hard to say when they will update but it\u2019s likely for be a few months.THINGS I REALLY LIKELow light AF is absolutely amazing! (Canon says it\u2019s the best they have ever offered.)Image quality is superb\u2026. even low light images.The automatic and semi-automatic modes produce excellent images even in complex lighting situations.GPS and WiFi are nice to have features and work well.I like the controls on the 6D better than the 40D. The camera is very customizable and the controls make using the features the camera offers easy.The Camera recognizes the lens and corrects for aberrations.THINGS I DON\u2019T LIKE SO MUCHI\u2019m not a big popup flash guy but without it the 6D can\u2019t serve as a wireless master controller for slaved flashes like the 7D which uses the popup for that purpose. That would have been a very nice feature for strobists like me.  Also having a little fill flash that is always on the camera comes in handy on occasion.Shutter (4000) and flash sync (180) speeds have been reduced from the 40D.

I cannot afford the 5D Mark III (someday), so the Canon EOS 6D was my pick. If you're not in a similar situation, you may find this review moot.If you've researched the 6D, you already know it has a 97% coverage viewfinder, a wimpy autofocus system and no headphone jack. It also lacks a double card slot and a pop-up flash.If you're a sports shooter, don't buy this camera. The autofocus system is too slow. But the center point AF works great in low light. I shoot in nightclubs a lot and have never had a problem. The high ISO setting produces very nice results in RAW (JPEGs are very noisy) and post-production in Lightroom 5 can fix any issues (again, only when shooting in RAW).Still picture and video quality is superb and very close (some say better) than the 5D Mark III.The 6D shares a lot of the 5D Mark III's DNA. Both use Canon's DIGIC 5+ processor. Both have the same high-resolution screens (the 6D's is 0.2 inches smaller).If you're moving up from a cropped sensor, consumer model Canon camera, you will be impressed. If you're coming off the recently discontinued 5D Mark II, you may find the button layout confusing and inferior. But the 6D has the latest specs and outshines the Mark II in my opinion.Most people looking at the 6D are either moving up from a consumer, cropped model, looking for a more affordable alternative from the 5D Mark III or looking for a second camera to supplement the Mark III. In all scenarios, you should be happy with your purchase.The kit lens (an L lens) is great and a big improvement if you've only used Canon's EF-S kit lenses.Since there's no pop-up flash, you'll need to buy a Speedlite and if you like to shoot with off-camera flash, you'll need to buy wireless triggers. I like the PIXEL KING E-TTL II Wireless Flash Trigger for CANON.

Also, and IMHO (others of course may differ), the clear advantages provided by the A7R's nice sensor and excellent Zeiss lenses are completely undone by the A7R's poor, super-fiddly, difficult-to-navigate, and easy to inadvertently trigger menu-driven user interface.

If you're looking at the 6D then I'm going to assume you have above average experience with photography and know the differences but CANNOT decide and pulling your hair out by now (I've been there and finally bought one).For many years I shot with a crop sensor.  Wonderful thing about photography technology is that for the price it just gets better.  I shot with the 20D for eight years (and the body was still going strong) and last year purchased the 60D.  I still have the 60D and very happy with majority of the results.  Having the extra reach with the crop is great for day time shoot.  It's one thing I missed suddenly with the 6D is having that extra reach.  Of course there were so many beauty packed in the 6D I was very much stunned.Few things I noticed right away with the 6D compared to the 60D:- Quiet shutter- A very sturdy feel even with it's compact design- Low light ISO performance is AMAZING- Bokeh is more beautiful with the full frameFew things I fell in love with the 6D:- Full frame = wider (My Tamron 17-35 became an ultra wide monster)- Very fast center focus speed- Noticeable smoother bokeh with every lensMinor things I miss from the 60D:- Losing reach (if you're coming from a cropped sensor that is)- Swivel screen for creative shots including astrophotography use- Tad bit slow on action shotsWhat I don't like:- Slow for action; 4.5fps is slower than the 60D and even slower than older xxD series.- The buffer isn't all that big compared to the 7D; again it's not a body geared towards dedicated to fast action- Max 1/4000 shutter speed; wide open during the day I have to set the ISO to 100 (or 50 sometimes) to avoid overexposureWhy I Went with the 6D instead of the 5DMKIII:One of many reasons why I didn't go with the 5DMKIII is the price and what I generally shot.  If I was a professional making a living with photography then the 5DMKIII would've been a no-brainer with its fast shutter speeds that can be use for sports, more AF focus points that are faster and dual memory card slot.  But I also don't shoot sports or wildlife currently.  At the same time I enjoy both natural & artificial lighting which meant for low-light situations, the 6D would outshine the 60D and most camera's out there (many tests show it outscores the 5DMKIII by few points).Low Light Sensitivity:I've only had this camera for a week so I haven't had the chance to get out there and shoot stars at night but quick initial test showed so much less noise than the 60D (even though 60D was by FAR better than my old 20D).  With the 60D I was shooting night sky at ISO3200 and up to 22 seconds or so to avoid star trails.  With the 6D I was able to shoot that with half the ISO (and probably more if I had the time and right sky) and same time (using the Rule of 500 instead of 600).I've shot many indoor portraits of my kids with the auto-ISO and I'm just completely blown at how this body can handle high ISO and have very usable photos anywhere.  Sure, shooting at ISO12800 doesn't mean I'll shoot it at that ISO and make prints all day but for everyday shots and what would've been difficult with other bodies is possible with the 6D.Body Design:Many people complain about the design of the body but I haven't noticed too much difference other than the button positions that's completely different from the 60D.  But I'll get used to it with time.  To compare my hand is about large to x-large in case you're wondering.  I did notice a slight awkwardness in changing the focus points on the fly.  I may have to custom assign the buttons.Bokeh:Everybody loves bokeh like fine chocolates.  With full frame sensor the bokeh is smoother and you'll notice a difference right away with similar focal lengths.  It's like looking at bokeh between the 50mm f1.8 & 50mm f1.4 with the same aperture.  But you'll notice the bokeh being a bit more creamier that really makes the subject pop.Wifi:I love this feature.  I have Galaxy S3 and downloaded Canon's app and I can shoot remotely with a click of a button.  I haven't had much time to play around with it but since it's Wifi I can remotely trigger the OCF.  Being able to see what's happening away from the camera & triggering it is a neat feature.  Of course for simplicity sake & save on battery (assuming Wifi function does eat up battery faster), then you can always get the wireless trigger for $12 on Amazon.Who It's Really For:I definitely feel this is one of the best camera's for portraits/weddings/still's without fast moving objects but also astrophotography and low-light shooting that demand great ISO performance without breaking bank.  It's like a stripped version of 5D MKIII but the image quality is the same if not hair better when it comes to high ISO shooting.If you're into sports/wildlife and want some of the best features then the 5D MKIII (or 1D-series for serious pro's) may be the ticket.  Of course if 5D is out of your budget and also want more frame rate I recently bought a mint condition 7D that shoots at 8fps.  Much faster (including the 5D) & great sports/wildlife body.  70D is also to be considered for serious photographers that also shoot videos with its \"continuous\" auto focusing (which is not on 6D or the 7D).  Personally I wouldn't mind having a combo of 6D & 70D but right now keeping the 60D when I need the extra reach and of course as a second body.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Budget Full Frame Camera That Doesn't Make You Feel Like You're On a Budget", "Author": "Josh Golden", "ReviewID": "RI7I1ZOE0D4RS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a photographer and a cinematographer, so image quality and clarity are incredibly important to me.

It's a great camera with a great lens. I upgraded from a Canon 20D and a Canon D30 prior. This was truly the first camera that Canon has released that tempted me to replace my 20D. My 20D served me some 8 years with 10s of thousands of images. I was determined to not upgrade again until a full frame camera became in the price range of the 20D. Finally, Canon brought the 6D out. I spent days comparing the 6D to the 5D Mark III which I borrowed from a co-worker. For my specific use, I did not find any situations where the 5D Mk III commanded the price difference. Obviously for certain photography, the 5D Mk III would be better... I just don't shoot a lot of fast action, nor any kind of birds. What I like about it is the amazing images generated by the auto ISO feature. Although I'm cautious with using high ISO settings, I've never had anything too noisy that I couldn't fix in Photoshop or Lightroom. The wifi connectivity is also great. I've used this camera my Android phone to capture spectacular long shutter images with ease. This camera after testing it for focus problems was put in a trial by fire situation where it captured 3000+ images of the course of 9 days.CONS: Battery life without additional battery grip is poor when using WiFi and / or GPS. This was very noticeable when compared to my 20D. My 20D could literally go 3 days+ shooting throughout the day without draining the battery. With GPS and WiFi, you will not make it through a long day... so keep the GPS / WiFi unless truly using the features. Lack of pop-up flash, I know this is hotly debated, but I think this should have been a feature on this camera. IMO, this camera is likely an upgrade for people coming from the x0D cameras where a pop-flash works in a bind. Fortunately, I do have a Speedlite 580 and the high ISO settings allow for great pics in relatively low light at manageable shutter speeds especially with IS lenses. Cost of lenses, this may / may not be an issue. This camera really pushes lenses hard. Personally, I have a collection of L lenses, but I would be concerned using lower quality lenses with this camera.Possible Con: The Canon 24-105 L like any lens can be a victim of quality control. I was very fortunate to receive a tack sharp 24-105 with no focus issues, but I know this can luck of the draw. If you buy the kit, test your lens for focusing issues before using it in situations you know you want keepers.If you are upgrading from older Canon D SLRs, I think this is a worthy upgrade especially if you like landscape / wide angle photography. I know I hated trying to compose sweeping images with the 20D and D30 due to the crop factor. In fact, I would use my old Canon film camera in certain situations.

It focuses well in low light using center point. I'm cool with the 1/4000, since i know how to compensate for it shooting wide open on a fast lens. I still would have preferred to buy a 7d type focusing body first (since I cant afford both). But I couldn't wait on a newer 7d with a new digic processor for better iso performance. So in short. I really love this camera. And I'm giving it 4 stars.The ONLY reason I'm taking off a star. Is because according to Canon, I'm not allowed to access the EOS remote app. And their not trying to help me. My guess is I'll have to get some kinda app to hide my ip or wait till i travel to the USA again. To install the app on my phone.

After reading around on internet I chose Canon 6D. I have this camera for 4 months (and I took about 2000 photos) and I am very happy with it. Together with the 24-105 lens it delivers an excellent performance. Very sharp images, great colors!I find its extra functions compared to Canon 5D Mark III, such as WiFi and GPS are very useful. Definitely good choice for which I do not regret at all.I have been reading reviews on internet comparing both 6D and 5D Mark III. All reviews have a common highlight that 5D Mark III has better auto focus system than 6D. Unfortunately, I did not have hands on experience with 5D Mark III to compare its AF with 6D. What I can tell as a prosumer is that 6D has quite good AF system. Even if 5D Mark III has better AF system than 6D, I doubt that it is worth 1000+ bucks unless your job constraints you.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent full frame camera", "Author": "Mark Anthony L. Serrano", "ReviewID": "R2VWEENWZOAFYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent full frame camera.  Overall grip handling is superb. Weight is acceptable, and it can be held by one hand. Of course, if you're using those massive L lenses then even with two hands won't be enough to hold those lenses comfortably. The 6D is a solid performer in daylight and lowlight. It can handle high ISOs without any issues. We're talking about 25000+ ISOs here. Of course this will also vary in your lens. Those wide aperture L lenses will provide you enough light in lowlight. The 6D also takes great video movies, though I haven't tested that feature fully because I'm more into photography.The 6D menu is easy to navigate. It's intuitive. Honestly, I have read the manual from cover to cover, but I haven't tinkered all the features in the camera (Make sure to set the copyright information right away and register your battery in the system menu). I focus more on practical usage. The WIFI feature is a nice addition along with the iPhone app. It's like having a viewable remote, though I don't use it often. I bought a separate remote switch controller since it's simpler to use than enabling WIFI and running the iPhone app (it's not that really complicated but the separate remote switch has the better tactile feel). I haven't used GPS much for fear of draining my battery (now that I have extra two more Canon batteries, also ordered in NewEgg), I think I can now safely enable it.In the final analysis, the reason why you would get this camera over other models are the following:* Canon-brand. It's a reliable name.* It's a full frame camera and not an APSC. This alone will make a difference.* Your existing lens set. If you've heavily invested in Canon lenses already, then you definitely need to get a Canon body* The cheapest of all Canon full frame* You value video but you don't care much about Moire patterns in video (5D Mark III handles Moire patterns far better)* Weight is lightweight compare to the more expensive full frame camers* New sensor and better ISO handling than higher Canon full frame models* (Edit) Cheaper than higher-end full frame cameras. 6D body $1899 vs 5D Mark III body $3499. The difference is about $1600. With $1600 you can buy a nice L lens.* Image quality is on-par or better than 5D Mark III and Mark IIAll other reasons are secondary. By the way the included kit lens, 24-105 L, is a superb well-rounded lens. It won't disappoint you. That's another reason to get this package.The negatives:* Video is susceptible to Moire patterns* No mic jack out* No integrated flash for controlling external speedlites (Yes, that's right. You want an integrated flash for controlling external speedlites and not because of the light. Integrated flash are weak)* (Edit) The 6D has far fewer AF points than most (or all) full frame cameras and some APSCs.

I moved up from the Rebel T1i.  I also had the XTi.  The difference is night and day.  Things to note when changing from a cropped sensor to a Full Frame: - Your fish eye may not work.  (I had the Rikonon 8mm with the hood you can't remove) - you can see the hood because of how wide a Full Frame is. - Your Wide Angle may look like a Fish Eye (my Tamron 10-24mm has a full circle at 10mm and the edges don't disappear until 15mm (without circular polarizing filter) or 16mm (with circular polarizing filter).  Doesn't bother me since the Canon wide angle goes from 16-35mm. - 24-105mm works better on the full frame than the cropped sensor.  It just looks brighter in general and there's better background blur. - 70-300mm - doesn't look like it's zooming as far. - 50mm 1.8f - still great even if the build isn't great - The cable release port is different than the Rebels.  I didn't know that so I found out the hard way.The lack of onboard flash kind of made me skeptical about getting it, but since it has really high ISO and it is a professional grade camera, that fear is silly.  I chose this over the Canon 5D mkIII because of the price difference and the options that came on the camera like WIFI and GPS.  I like those features more than having a secondary memory slot for a compact flash card.The body build is nice and solid.

I just got the camera on Friday and spent the weekend shooting 24/7, so here are my impressions.- Feel and handling are great.  This camera is built like a tank.- The controls, dials, and menus are pretty intuitive, especially considering how technologically advanced this camera is.  There were only a couple of functions for which I had to consult the manual.  Everything else was easy to figure out if you are used to Canon's menus on other cameras.- Picture quality is top notch.  Colors are vibrant.  Images are sharp.  I am thrilled with the picture quality.  I shot 90% RAW files and they look outstanding after processing.  I experimented with a few jpegs and they looked great as well.  On a number of shots I had to crop significantly, and I noticed no appreciable loss in quality or resolution.  20.1 megapixels gives you the ability to do almost anything you want and enlarge prints or crop down and maintain a quality image.- Focusing is very fast.  Although this only has 11 focus points, it is able to focus easily in very low light.  I was able to auto focus for a good hour and a half after sunrise.  One night was especially starry, and this camera was able to autofocus on the night sky.  Amazing!- ISO is the best thing about this camera.  It's ISO capability is as good as anything that I could imagine.  I was able to shoot up to 3200 with little noise, and even got some usable shots at higher ISOs.  I still prefer to shoot at 100 all the time, but it is great having the ability to go up a few ISO notches in early morning or late evening to avoid bulb speeds and enable a wide depth of field.- Battery life -- this was an unexpected plus.  I assumed that with all of the bells and whistles that the battery power would decrease quickly, but I was able to go out and shoot for about three hours doing multiple exposure HDR shots continuously and the battery stayed strong, losing only one bar.- Level.  The in screen level is an awesome feature.- Bracketing -- Contrary to many reports, this camera is not limited to three bracketed shots when shooting multiple exposures for HDR.  You can set it all the way up to 7 shots on the custom functions menu, just like a Nikon.- Speed.  4.5 fps is plenty fast for me.  I imagine that this might not be the perfect camera for action shots, but 4.5 is just right for doing landscape work.- Lens.  Fantastic image quality on this lens and it is great having the extra focal length above and beyond the 24-70.  I considered getting a 24-70 but I am glad to have this lens.  It's a great walkabout lens.  The only complaint -- I get some very noticeable vignetting at wide angle, but this comes out easily in photoshop.  All in all, its not enough to seriously complain about.- Wireless Function -- It takes a minute or so for my EOS iphone app to locate the wireless that the camera emits.  Once it is connected, the Wi-Fi features operate flawlessly.  Some consumer models had an articulating screen, which came in very handy for odd angle landscape shots.  Although I miss the articulating screen, the wireless function more than makes up for it with the ability to live view through the phone and control exposure from the phone.- Overall -- You will love this camera/lens combo!UPDATE - I HAVE USED THIS CAMERA NOW FOR OVER 6 MONTHS AND WOULD RETRACT MY INITIAL REVIEW ABOUT THE WIRELESS FUNCTION.  THIS IS A GREAT CAMERA BUT IF YOU ARE BUYING IT FOR THE WIRELESS FEATURES, LOOK ELSEWHERE.  THE WIRELESS INITIALLY WORKED BUT OVER TIME HAS PROVEN VERY VERY VERY UNRELIABLE.

The two custom setting modes allow you to set up profiles that match your exact needs ahead of time for the conditions you expect to encounter if they're not already covered by the other modes, which I find especially handy for filming. What I find most handy is the Wi-Fi function, which can by synced up to a smart phone for remote viewing and firing.

It has a large enough buffer to take bursts of RAW+JPG without slowing down like cheaper cameras, and build quality is fantastic.  This camera feels great in the hand!In terms of weaknesses, the autofocus system on this camera is dated with 11 autofocus points only 1 of which is cross-type.  This means it has far less cross-type sensors than a Canon Rebel T5i which costs less than half the price.  That being said, the autofocus does work fine for weddings, regular people shots, and landscapes.  In a scenario with sports or one that requires constant tracking, you will likely be disappointed, though.  So if you want a sports camera, this is not it!  For other general events it is great.Another weakness is the lack of joystick or touchscreen.  This is an issue as previewing pictures is a bit of a chore using the directional arrows to zoom around images.  If the camera had a touchscreen or joystick, moving the zoomed area around would be much easier.  The lack of joystick also makes changing the autofocus point more of a hassle, though you probably want to be using center point only most of the time.Finally, contributing to the loss of a star was the EOS Remote Utility. The PC version was a bit of a hassle to install (you need to turn off your firewall to link it up) and there is no app for Lumia Windows Phone & Surface 2 which is disappointing.In summary, the output of this camera is incredible as is the build quality.

I don't know all the technical aspects of cameras and lenses, but I do know how to take a good photo. That being said, I did a lot of research on different camera models when I was deciding on an upgrade. I was initially set on a 7D for its price and ability to be used with EF-S glass (I have a 350D from back in 2005). However, I love shooting indoors and in low light, so with more digging, full-frame became the ideal choice.The deal on Amazon was AMAZING for this camera at the time I purchased ($1575 for the body only); I bought it, along with an EF 50mm f/1.4 to start. WELL, I am absolutely IN LOVE with this camera. The low-light functioning is superb, and the image quality (especially at high ISO) is simply astounding. I have not had any issues with the AF, as many reviewers find it to be a down-side to the 6D, but I also do not need many AF points since I don't often shoot action photography. One thing that I am not thrilled about is how the shutter speed only goes up to 1/4000. That is a bummer for me, but certainly not a deal breaker. I have yet to set-up the WiFi/GPS functioning so I can't speak on its performance, but it's pretty sweet that it has this option.All in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase and I feel I made the right decision. Granted, I have not had the camera THAT long yet but I am content with the results I have gotten so far--see some example images below.

I also picked up a Nikon D600 at work at a similar time frame.  Bottom line is I love this camera and prefer it over the D600 even though on paper the D600 is superior.  It shoots great in low light, the 24-105 is a great general purpose lens, even it has a bit of distortion.  A common complaint is the unsophisticated autofocus system has not been an issue for me, 99% of the time I always use the center focus point and reframe after focusing on what I want to be the sharpest, and in this fashion the 6D out performs all other cameras I've used due to the hypersensitive center focus point.  If you shoot a lot of moving targets, this could be an issue for you, but for the rest of us, it is not.The only complaint I have about the camera has to do with HDR mode.  The nikon will not rotate the mirror for each exposure whereas the 6D does, this seems so unnecessary and seems to prolong the amount of time required to obtain the image.  Also Canon intentionally crippled the HDR mode to only save in JPEG to provide differentiation to the 5D Mk III.  What is most annoying about only allowing HDR in JPEG mode is the interface doesn't make it at all clear why HDR cannot be enabled if your output format includes RAW.  Although the interface on Canon SLRs is not very good, Nikon is arguably worse, and certainly no better.  No one buys these cameras for their interface, so there's not a lot of emphasis.

It has been probably the best 1700 dollars I have ever spent!I am mostly a enthusiast, but hope to become a professional someday soon, and I was shocked at the improvement of my images. This camera does not disappoint at all.When I was researching this camera, I had two major concerns about it. The AF and the lack of a second card slot. I got it anyway, because the majority of my pictures are portraits or nature, and I use the center AF point to one shot focus and recompose 99% of the time so I figured the lack of extra cross type AF points wouldn't bother me... and it doesn't. The center point is wonderful in its own right, and unless you want to shoot action or need to use other AF points this camera will more than suffice for you. The lone SD card slot also made me worry, but then I was used to only having one in my Rebel anyway, so it doesn't seem like a loss of anything for me personally. Since you can have 200+ GB cards now, I dont see why you would need two for space. I would, of course, like to have the backup function in case of corruption, but I haven't ever experienced that, and *knock on wood* hopefully I wont have to. SD cards are pretty inexpensive so I can afford to have some extras as backup.I was surprised at how big and sturdy it felt. I had only really used my Rebel before this, and all the reviews talk about how the 6D was so much smaller than the other Full Frames.. and I guess it is, but then the Mark III would be huge! It isn't something that bothers me though, I like how much nicer it feels in my hand, and now my Rebel feels like a little toy.The bottom line is that this camera can disappoint on paper but does NOT disappoint in practice. If you want to shoot action, you probably should get the Mark III, but for your money the 6D cant really be beat... I mean what do people expect? You get what you pay for in the end, and if what you want is amazing portraits and stills the 6D would be great for you.

I got back into photography in early 2013, and chose the Canon EOS Rebel T3i as my entry vehicle.  I used it constantly, and even bought a couple of extra lenses for it (Sigma 18-250mm, Canon EF 50mm f/1.4).  I really enjoyed using that camera, but eventually found its major limitation: low light photography.  I've become a fan of low light and long exposure night photography, and decided I needed a full frame camera to give me an edge in this branch of photography.  After doing my homework, comparing the major contenders, I settled on the EOS 6D.  I managed to get my 6D in early January 2014, while Amazon still had the sale running.  I paid under $2,100 for the 6D kit, including the EF 24-105mm f/4.0 lens.After un-boxing and assembling the 6D (and charging up the battery), I started exploring its features.  I shot several photos in auto mode, inside of the house, just to see what the camera would do.  It was night, and fairly dark in the house (only two lights on).  The camera chose to drop the ISO down to 6400, and then to 12800 while in auto mode.  I thought for sure they would be full of noise, but was very pleased with the outcome.  The photos shot at ISO 6400 had virtually no noise, and the ones shot at ISO 12800 had very little.  Embolden by this, I stepped outside into the night.  Our street was lit only by two street lights, each one a block away in different directions, and by some stray light from a neighbor's outside lights.  I switched the 6D to manual mode and started taking pictures.  I was totally amazed that the autofocus would be able to focus on dark objects with so little contrast in them, and that I was able to get really good photos, hand-holding the camera, with a usable shutter speed.That weekend my wife and I went to the 46th Florida Rail Fair at the Volusia County Fair Grounds.  I took the 6D and shot somewhere over 350 photos and one fairly short video.  No flash was used for this, just the lighting inside of the buildings.  I was really amazed at the quality of the photos.  Since then, I've used the 6D to take some long exposure star trail photos, and to also get some shorter low light star point photos.  The 6D has performed flawlessly in these endeavors, and is very much deserving of the reviews it has received for its ability to focus in low light and take very usable photos in low light situations.I read the reviews about the 6D's more primitive autofocus, and while it does lag behind the 70D and 5D Mark III, its ability to autofocus in very low light/low contrast conditions more than outweighs it's lack of focus points and somewhat slower autofocus.  By the way, I've used this camera during the day as well, and have had no problems with the autofocus taking too long to acquire focus.If you can get this camera/lens kit during a sale, grab it.

It is an excellent camera.My previous/ current DSLR is a 10D from about a decade ago.  The 10D is a magnesium bodied camera like this, but the 6D is much, much lighter and smaller.  The mag body on the 10D saved it from a lot of hard knocks, it traveled all over the world with me and took a lot of abuse.  Covered in dents, dings and dangs and still works perfectly.  I hope/ believe the 6D will give the same durability.The big question that most ask regards the differences between this and the 5D Mk3.  Do your research and learn for yourself, it will be a valuable process and will teach you a lot about this camera and it's capabilities.  I took the PDF of each camera's users manual on a trip to NYC before Christmas and read each on my tablet on the plane to familiarize myself with those differences.  Due diligence for a multi-$thousand purchase.  I have the finances to afford a 5D Mk3, but chose the 6D instead.  All accounts from most all reputable review sites and pros that have used both are that the images are the same.  Image quality is most important to me.  The 6D has the WiFi which enables very very cool features, and also GPS.  The 5D has features that a pro might need (faster focus, faster auto-drive and a headphone out jack to monitor audio recorded when shooting video to name a few) but none of that was important to me and I saved a bunch of cash getting this camera that produces the same images which is what is important to me.  If you really want to shoot video professionally with the 6D, get a Zoom H4n (etc) digital audio recorder, sync the audio and video in post and monitor the audio in real time from the Zoom as you shoot.  6D plus Zoom is still much cheaper than 5D Mk3 with a built-in headphone jack (well under $2k).Canon seems to have removed/ disabled some features available with the Digic 5 processor just so that a pro considering the 5D won't be dissuaded from buying it (when comparing the two), and there is the \"more money than common sense\" pro-sumer crowd who will simply buy the more/ most expensive model because it brings them prestige, bragging rights and feeds their ego.  If you are neither a sports shooting pro nor an egotistical pro-sumer, give this camera a serious look.My hope is that as time passes and new models are introduced, canon will add new features and performance to this camera via firmware updates that bring it's focusing, shutter speed and other attributes closer to the 5D.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent professional grade Digital SLR Camera.", "Author": "Bruce Hood", "ReviewID": "R29RVCE4RTJOW9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned a number of Canon Cameras over many years, and this is an excellent example of Canon design.

Fantastic camera, glad I bought it!The details: I'm going to start with what I don't like first. Keep in mind that none of these are significant and do not affect my enjoyment of the camera a bit. They are small things that I've noticed, though. First, the build quality is slightly below what I would expect. I have no doubt that the camera is rugged, but I'm used to feeling the sturdiness of a camera in my hands.

Obviously this last comparison is debatable and can actually be ignored entirely; both produce stunning images that are only slightly different upon unusual inspection. If you're used to a point-and-shoot or worse, your cell phone camera, you'll probably cry a little once you see the images this thing takes. They're sharp naturally, without post-processing. The exposure is sometimes a tad off, but it's still better than most bodies I've used.Low-light: I found out by accident how capable this camera was of taking low-light images. After opening the camera the night I received it, clicked the shutter by accident and was blown away by the image it produced. The ISO was not cranked to the max and the lens was not particularly open. I've added the image to show what I mean. On my previous cameras, those shadows in such low light would have been indecipherable. This is my go-to when out for an evening shoot.UI: As mentioned, there is a slight learning curve. Canon moved some things around, I think to keep up with modern conventions, so if you're coming from a previous Canon body you might have to take some time to learn where all the important settings are. But once you find them, they're easy to remember. Buttons, dials, etc., are all self-explanatory.Specs: On paper the camera is impressive. All of its features add up to a wonderful photography experience. Low-light noise handling, the autofocus, dynamic range, ISO, shutter speed, and general speed are all superb thanks to the powerful processor. The viewfinder is clear and encompassing. You can crop in-camera and the battery lasts plenty.Bells and Whistles: This thing has them. They were not a primary concern for me, but after a month of heavy use I can say I'm glad they're there. The Wi-fi and GPS enablement is a time-saver and appreciated nicety. The latter is becoming increasingly popular with online photo sites, so it's just something cool to have built-in.The magic: The processor and focus mechanisms in this thing are unparalleled. There are times where I would normally switch into manual focus to get the right feel to the picture, but this camera predicts with 90% accuracy what I intended. When shooting complex subjects with multiple textures, the camera accurately selects what I would have focused on. And beyond just focusing on faces of human subjects, it targets specifically their eyes. It's wonderful.This camera is amazing. If you've been contemplating this for a while and have had trouble justifying the cost or have been switching between this and other bodies but have yet to make a decision, but it. If you stumbled across this and are considering it for an expensive impulse buy, buy it. If you have a significant other still using an earlier body and want to help them step up their game, buy it.

It was my first L lens.  I was astonished by the images and the sharpness and contrast.  Then I picked up the 100mm f/2.8L macro lens and it has become my favorite.  A few comments about pros and cons.  I have several Canon APS C cameras and this is my first full frame.  For sports photos I still prefer my D50 with at least 6fps continuous.  I do not consider the 6D 4fps a con.  Sports  continuous shooting does not require 20MP.  News papers do not publish high resolution images.  I am still experimenting with customizing my buttons.  This camera is just so much fun to play with.OK, pros:The AF system works in the dimmest light.The SDHC is as good as the older CF memory and much less expensive.I do not miss pop-up flash at all.  Flash should be taken off camera anyway.The fit and finish of the 6D is excellent.The less noisy shutter does not frighten small animals and insects for Macro work.The white balance is a pleasure to work with.The larger pixels on the sensor are less noisy than APS C sensors.Now cons:The WiFi and GPS are just gimmicks.  I have only used the WiFi with a laptop for time-lapse but that was always possible with a USB cable.The D6 is a little too light for L lenses and I worry about the camera/lens mount.I am irritated with warnings when using non-Canon batteries.  After all, canon sometimes ships Panasonic or Polaroid batteries with their cameras.Overall, I love this camera and I would recommend it to others.

CHARLOT", "ReviewID": "RGQ9HRG1J98JG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are many reviews by professionals on this camera, so I won't go into the hard technical details. For that, see DPReview.com, or read the reviews by Ken Rockwell and Bryan Carnathan. What I want to discuss here are my reasons for buying this 6D instead of the 5D-Mk.II or 5D-Mk.III.  First off, I already have a 60D and four \"L\" series lenses, plus a Rokinon 85mm f1.4.  The 60D is a wonderful camera, but the APS-C sensor, with it's 1.6 crop factor, was preventing me from getting the most out of my lenses. I knew I wanted a full-frame body, but the 5D was priced too high for me.  When the 6D recently became available for $1499, I knew it was time to upgrade. At that price, it was only $500 more than the 60D's original list price, and with the on-board GPS, full frame sensor, and all of the other features, it is an amazing value. Comparing the 6D to the 5D Mk. III side by side, the 6D offers about 95% of the functionality of the 5D-III for $1,000 less. The only major differences appear to be that the 5D-III has two additional megapixels, a faster burst rate, larger buffer memory, a fancier autofocus system with more focus points, and a slightly better pentaprism that gives a100% viewfinder frame.  The CMOS sensor in the 6D has almost identical performance in terms of signal to noise ratio, high ISO capability, and color rendition; i.e. it captures images every bit as beautiful as the 5D Mk.III.  The 5D Mk. III probably has better weather sealing. In the hand, the 6D and 60D feel virtually identical, and the 6D feels almost exactly like the 5D-III except a little lighter in weight. This ergonomic similarity is especially true if comparing the three cameras with battery grips installed on them.  Ergonomics is extremely important to me: if the camera is too small (like the Canon Rebel series), or somehow just doesn't feel good in the hand, the photography \"experience\" won't be as enjoyable.  The 60D and 6D both feel wonderful in your hand.  If you buy a 6D, I highly recommend getting a BG-13 battery grip for it, especially if you will be using the heavier \"L\" series lenses like the 70-200. The NEEWER and Meike battery grips are both solid pieces of kit for around $40 (or you could pay the $200 for Canon's \"official\" BG-13 if you are a Canon purist).Now for some specifics Pros and Cons:Pros:1. Full frame 35mm x 24mm, 20 megapixel CMOS sensor. Takes beautiful, noise free images up to to ISO 3200, and very good (slightly noisy) images to ISO 6400. Much higher ISO speeds are available, but the signal-to-noise ratio falls off fast above ISO 6400.  There are cameras from Nikon, Pentax and Sony that have sensors up to 36 megapixels, but realistically, very few people will ever print an image larger than 20\" x 30\", and the 20 megapixels that the 6D delivers are more than enough resolution for 20\"x30\" prints.2. On Board GPS and WiFi.  The GPS allows for automatically geotagging your photos with latitude, longitude, and elevation data in the EXIF header; a very nice feature for landscape photography. The GPS can be set to just geotag images, or store a continuous GPS tracklog.  The tracklog feature increases battery drain, and I don't recommend using it if you have an actual GPS (like a Garmin handheld unit) for hiking trips.  WARNING: Power to the GPS chipset on the 6D is not controlled by the main power switch on the camera!  Even when that switch is \"off\", the GPS is still running if it has been enabled in the camera's menu.  This will drain your battery flat in a few hours. So don't forget to either remove the battery or disable GPS in the menu when putting the camera away at the end of a shooting session.  This is not a malfunction: Canon designed the GPS chipset to function this way so that the camera would always be ready to shoot instantly (assuming you are outdoors with a clear view of the sky). A GPS chipset can take as long as 7 minutes to lock on to satellites and initialize it's location if the device has been powered down for several weeks and/or moved a long distance since it's last use. Even a \"warm re-start\" of a GPS unit can require 20 to 40 seconds to initialize, and that's far too long for a photographer to capture a shot of a moving subject. So the 6D has been designed to keep the GPS \"hot\" and ready for instant use, even when the main power switch is \"off\".  The WiFi capability has several uses: transfer of images to a WiFi printer or another WiFi enabled camera, Connection to an Android or Apple IOS smart phone running Canon's EOS Remote App, and maybe other uses I haven't heard about. I have used the WiFi remote capability on my Samsung Galaxy MP3 player and it does work, although setup and configuration seems to be more difficult and complicated than it ought to be. EOS Remote puts the camera into LiveView mode and lets you see what the sensor is seeing. You can control ISO, aperture and shutter speed, and trip the shutter, from much farther away than with the Canon infrared remote, and in any direction from the camera. I haven't tested the maximum range, but WiFi is supposed to be good out to at least 100'.  Don't forget that WiFi is also a heavy drain on the camera's battery, so don't forget to turn it off when not in use.  You can download EOS Remote for free from Canon's website.3. Excellent User interface for the Menu system. Most of the configuration and control stuff is right at the top level of the menu: there are only a few, less-often needed commands that are on the second level of the menu.  The camera's control buttons and dials are easy to use. The only one I don't like is that the Menu button is on the left side of the LCD screen, where it is out of reach of my right hand fingers. I suppose I'll get used to it.CONS: There are not many things to complain about with this camera. I don't like the placement of the Menu button on the left side of the body. The LCD screen is fixed instead of articulated like the 60D's screen, and there is no built-in flash. This last is because of the larger pentaprism required on a full-frame DSLR. The 60D can have a flash because the reflex mirror and pentaprism for it's APS-C format sensor are much smaller.Overall, the 6D's ergonomics are a lot like the 60D, and it's performance is similar, except for the larger sensor and the added features like the GPS.  If you already have a 60D, and have been thinking of moving up to a full-frame body to get the most out of your lenses, the 6D is certainly worth your consideration. Do a very careful comparison to the 5D Mk-III, and you are likely to find that the 6D offers more than enough functionality for general purpose and landscape photography, while saving you enough money to buy another \"L\" series lens (maybe that 70-200 f2.8 USM!).  If you are a professional Sports photographer, the 5D Mk-III is clearly a better choice, with a substantially better burst rate, a more sophisticated auto-focus system, and more buffer memory.A last word about batteries, accessories and lenses. The 6D has a new battery-communication algorithm in the firmware. If you have aftermarket LP-E6 batteries that were made before September 2013, they might not be fully functional in the 6D - even those that work perfectly in the 5D and 60D. These will power the 6D, but will not communicate the Shutter cycle and charge state data to the camera. If you are looking on Amazon for batteries, make sure the ad specifically states that the batteries have the 6D chip.I highly recommend purchasing a battery grip for the 6D as soon as you buy the camera, especially if you use \"L\" series lenses. These lenses are heavy, and the extra weight of the battery grip will help counterbalance the lens, not to mention giving you more surface area to grab with your hands while shooting handheld.Lenses: There are a multitude of lenses out there for the Canon EF mount, both Canon brand and aftermarket. I am primarily a landscape photographer, and after a lot of deliberation, I settled on the following 5 lenses. These cover 99% of all the photographic situations I am ever likely to be in:1. Canon EF 14-40 f4.0 \"L\" USM. [http://www.amazon.com/Canon-17-40mm-Ultra-Angle-Cameras/dp/B00009R6WO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1389739399&sr;=8-2&keywords;=14-40mm+canon]This lens covers your wide-angle needs. It's your go-to lens for shooting indoors or close up to large objects. Be forewarned that there is a significant amount of barrel distortion at the wide end, but this can be partially corrected in Photoshop. This lens is not image stabilized, but since it's a wide angle, you don't really need IS.2. Canon EF 24-105 f4.0 \"L\" IS USM. [http://www.amazon.com/Canon-24-105mm-USM-Lens-Cameras/dp/B000AZ57M6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1389741846&sr;=8-1&keywords;=24-105mm+canon]This is my bread-and-butter lens that is on the camera for at least 75% of my photography. If you buy the 6D bundled with this lens, you will save $400 over buying it separately.  A really nice lens overall, some minor barrel distortion at the wide end.3. Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6L IS USM UD [http://www.amazon.com/Canon-70-300mm-USM-Telephoto-Cameras/dp/B0040X4PQI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1389741907&sr;=8-2&keywords;=70-300mm+canon]This is my second-most-used lens next to the 24-105. It is not parfocal and not constant-aperture like most of the other \"L\" lenses, but it offers the crystal sharpness one expects from a \"L\" lens, and more \"reach\" than the 70-200 lenses. The only downside to this lens is that it can not be used with Canon's 1.4x or 2.0x teleconverters.4. Canon EF 70-200 f2.8 USM [http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-70-200mm-2-8L-USM/dp/B00006I53W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1389744078&sr;=8-2&keywords;=70-200mm+canon]This lens is arguably the best medium telezoom Canon makes for use by landscape photographers. It doesn't have image stabilization, which means two fewer pieces of glass in the light path, and therefore fewer potential distortions. All of the images I have captured with this lens have been tack-sharp, with faithful color rendition, and smooth bokeh in those shots where I wanted a blurred background. It is also my best telephoto lens for twilight photography, having a constant f2.8 aperture throughout the zoom range. Not having image stabilization, and the fact that it's VERY heavy, means this lens is best mounted on a tripod, but it retails for $900 less than the image stabilized version, which is enough savings to buy you that 17-40.5. Rokinon 85mm f1.4 Prime.  This was bought specifically for low light and night shots, and \"portrait\" style images where I want a very shallow depth of field. Since I don't do that kind of shooting very often, I thought this $285 lens was a more sensible choice than the $1700 Canon equivalent (the Canon is f1.2, which is why the price is so high).  This Rokinon is made by Samyang in South Korea, and is totally a manual lens, so best used in Live View mode, where you can zoom in and fine tune the focus.  The focus is slightly soft at apertures below f5.6, but tack-sharp above that. Samyang makes good quality lenses: both of the Rokinon 85mm Primes I've owned had smooth acting control rings, and the bodies were made of metal, not plastic.Summary: The Canon 6D is an excellent value overall, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for either new owners purchasing their first DSLR, or those moving up from an older Canon DSLR who already own one or more \"L\" series lenses and want to get the most from their lens investment.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simply superb", "Author": "Markus Manninen", "ReviewID": "R2YZIWITHE9K9H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting a long time to get a full frame sensor DSLR.

It is an amazing camera.It may not have the 5 billion focus points of the 5DmkIII, or 75 frames per second of the 1D X, but for what this camera is, it is fantastic.  Pictures are amazing, and video is pretty much excellent.  The auto focus is fast and reliable. And having GPS and WiFi is a nice perk.Is the camera perfect?  No.  Some people will want more focus points... or a second card slot... but for most people these just aren't going to be real issues.  If you've got your camera setup right you only need one good focus point, and if you are buying reliable memory cards of sufficient there is no need for multiple slots.  Sports photographers may want more frames per second, but for everyone else this camera is more than fast enough.Having a few features migrate up from the 70D would be nice too.  Its ability to auto-focus while shooting video and the touch-to-focus feature of that camera would definitely be nice to have.  Having used both, I can see where those features are nice to have.The only other things that would make this better would be if Canon were to figure out how to get rid of the moire pattern in video (not an issue if you are in control of what your subject is wearing, and you don't shoot video against brick walls) and if the GPS didn't continue to drain the battery when the camera is powered off.  It would also be nice to be able to use WiFi while shooting video too, but that is far from being a deal-breaker.But most people looking at the 6D are doing so because they want the benefits of full-frame... higher image quality, lower noise, the ability to shoot good quality pictures in low light, and a shallower depth of field.  In all of these areas the 6D definitely delivers the goods.For what it's worth, DXOMark.com found that the 6D has very slightly better image quality than the 5DmkIII.  So if you're hesitating on a 6D because you fear that the mkIII produces better images, don't... its extra two megapixels are completely meaningless.If you're on the fence, just get it.

I just want to point out some overlooked features from an enthusiast's viewpoint. I have waited two years and read countless reviews before I got the 6D. My previous camera was a 10-year-old, $600 G3 (still working & in excellent condition). When I saw the 5DII, I knew then I wanted the Full Frame picture quality. But the price was too high for an \"8-year-old\" camera with an \"old\" chip. The 5DIII was a disappointment, just on the MSRP alone; since I am not looking to make money off my pictures. The price point was too high just for a hobby. After all, my first two cars combined, didn't cost this much!I was happy to see when Canon released the 6D. From the specs, it looked like a true successor to the 5DII. I think it is unfair for people to compare it directly to the 5DIII. For starters, its $1k off the 7-month-old 5DIII, with some AF & few features missing, and added WiFi and GPS; same great picture quality with no cropping.Here is a list from an ENTHUSIAST point of view:*Actually Two AF systems, 11-point and sensor detect (like point and shoot). Since I am not a sports shooter, this is more than enough for me.*Powerful in camera processing system - shoot in RAW, and then change (lots of) setting, save to JPEG. No PC needed. Great feature, just pack a large memory card >32GB, it's cheap.*In camera HDR and multiple shots, (like $100 software built into the camera)*WiFi is awesome!!! It opens up so many possibilities. The 6D connected to my Android, iPad, TV and PC with ease. WiFi file transfer / remote control shooting with PC, iPad and phone.*Weight, lightest FF, good when traveling, but it is still heavy with loaded with L lens.*Many \"Auto\" settings to fall back on, when I just want to take a simple picture.*GPS picks up fast under 3 min, but I haven't had time (or interest) to play with it yet.There are some disturbing cons with the 6D:*My first new 6D was creaking on the right of the viewfinder. The replacement, another NEW 6D is okay, but...*It STILL creaks! Lower left corner of the top small LCD indicator.  Since the fist return end up costing me $60 in shipping and that it is much less obvious than before, I will keep this one.*Rubber peeling in the corner, reveling white epoxy underneath.*the gaps around the two LCD screens unnecessarily large, and may trap dirt.*8-way controller is mushy. A poor design in an iPhone age.*While many buttons and even the two scroll wheels are programmable, oddly, Canon restricts two unique functions to one button. Like, I cannot get Depth of Field Preview and another button for the Level. I have to pick one because both functions are restricted to that one button.Accessories:PNY Polaroid 64GB SDXC - inexpensive, large storage, fast card. 6D formats it into 59.6 GB exFat (manual says Fat) and shows max 1999 (do show the correct pic/size in 3\" LCD). Won't read in older readers. 6D WiFi xfer solves this problem.*Canon 40mm STM - I really like its small and light factor. Good image and built quality. I kept this on the 6D the most.*Canon 24mm-105mm L - if I can have only one lens, this is it. Good all around range + IS. No lens creep so far*Canon 70mm-300mm IS USM - good zoom for a good price. No lens creep so far*Canon 430EX flash, works great the 6D; lots of functions, able to adjust the flash from the 6D.*AGFA UV lenses, good quality, cheap price for lens protection; AGFA CPL iffy built quality, but it works fine as CPL.*extra batteries - one is not enough...Even to me, a Canon fan, this poor body quality is worrisome. I wouldn't expect this in a $200 camera, let alone a $2k one! For example, the G3  with its mostly metal body doesn't make any creaking noise. The 6D's noisy plastic top makes me feel that Canon cut some corners on built quality with this \"cheap-est\" Canon FF DSLR.Overall, the 6D is still the right camera for me, as an enthusiast. It has the features I care about and more than enough adjustments to grow my skills. Currently, even if the 5DIII was the same price, I'd pick the 6D; for its size, weight & wi-fi and give up a few AF points, extra card slot, and some \"pro\" features I don't use/need.

(Funny I have 2 slots on my D300s and never use the SD), LOL.No pop up flash but I have it with my Nikon D300s and don't use it a lot.Wish we can record Colors and B&W; @ the same time, I know we can convert with softwares but it's not the same on the final print in my opinion.I have to tested now on events and them will post a review, for now i'm very impressed with image quality and the solid construction that Canon give us with this amazing camera for a great price with the 24-105mm.will bring the camera price to 1450.00 since the lens it's selling for over 1000.00.Overal very Happy with CANON and probably will have another D6 or any other model from Canon since i'm start to sell all my NIKON gear on Ebay, One flash is gone for a friend with Nikon camera 1 lens start to have bids so it's sold for the price i asked,d200 sold already 2 months ago and probably will sell the D300s and all lens DX to.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I was deciding between the mark iii and this 6D", "Author": "alongtheivy", "ReviewID": "R1FP55DK81RREM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I debated a long time between the canon mark iii and this 6D.

The camera can focus at very low light levels making it perfect for performing arts photography or Family photos in low light conditions without a flash. The 6D simply outperforms other cameras I have compared it to in low light settings including the 5D Mk 3.

You can literally sit in a candle-lit room and take a well-exposed, relatively noise-free photo that looks just like what your eyes are seeing. Needless to say, in less challenging, more mundane situations, the resulting photos are also gorgeous. I'm sure that a 5D-III or Leica is might be better in some regards, but I can't imagine any reason ever really needing anything more than this body.

I am a professional, simply meaning I get hired to take photos of people, landscapes, and events and I expect to be paid for that work. :)- surpasses the Mark II and the 7D in image quality, for what I shoot and the way I shoot it. The reduction of noise in low light is fantastic. I also found that my 7D just wasn't reliable when it came to metering. It's so nice to know that what I'm seeing in the live preview is what I'll actually have to work with in editing. I really missed the full frame when I moved from a 5DII to a 7D for video purposes.- highlight alert, when enabled, is helpful to me. I have a tendency to overexpose and that is a big blinking reminder to adjust my settings.- you have to press Q before the keypad function will work (for copyrighting images, naming wi-fi, etc.). I don't remember that from the 7D or the 5DII.- the wi-fi functionality is really cool. It's more difficult to make it work when there is another wi-fi network present, and I really wish I could use it with video. This isn't really functional with anything that moves too quickly, so I don't know why they tout it as a benefit for wildlife photography. It is more useful in situations where you need the camera to be really high or really low, self-portraits and DIY family portraits, or perhaps photographs of your kids playing where you don't want to be in the room distracting them.- it appears that they've tried to make it so the camera only communicates fully with Canon brand batteries. Other batteries work, but you can't view the power level, and if you're using a third party battery it will tell you 'can not communicate with battery' whenever you turn the camera on, which is super annoying. Sometimes I turn the camera on and try to start shooting right away and the shutter won't go because that screen is still up.- video with STM lenses doesn't automatically continuously autofocus (I believe the EOS M is the only body that does that right now). You can still focus with it by hitting the back button but it's not really functional for moving subjects or low-light situations - exposure goes all over the place and it's hella loud. There might be a setting I'm missing for the exposure problem.- joystick missing from the 7D is replaced by a directional pad inside the big wheel around the 'set' button. I prefer it to the joystick.- video modes are expanded to include ALL-I and IPB. I had never heard of these modes before, but as far as I can understand it, ALL-I compression is done in each frame, and it's restricted to that one frame, making it ideal for situations where you'd need to be grabbing stills from your video. With IPB, the frames are more reliant on each other and you might get enhanced detail. I can't see any difference in image quality.- I shoot with a few vintage lenses and it works fantastically. When I used vintage lenses on my 5DII, the mirror would get stuck every once in a while, prompting me to switch to the 7D. The mirror works fine with my vintage lenses despite a shallower body?- no buttons on the left side, takes a bit of getting used to coming from the 7D.- you can change the aspect ratio of what you're shooting. Default is 3:2, but 1:1, 4:3, and 16:9 are also included. 16:9 is great for time-lapses.- autofocus is similar to MKII. I like it simple, but there does seem to be a little problem with hunting for focus in extremely low light conditions. I like to take photos completely in the dark with a flash sometimes, and it's kind of difficult - could be partly a lens choice, too.- there doesn't seem to be a way to turn off live view exposure simulation... not sure if I'm missing something there.Overall, this camera is fantastic and very much worth the money for what I use it for.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dream Come True", "Author": "Family Man \"Image Man\"", "ReviewID": "RN69CTMME0THD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You have to see the images to believe it.

In the year that I've had my 60D, I've taken over 50,000 photos, varying from hiking the Cascades in Washington to snapping pictures of my friends at parties. I really liked my 60D. But I wanted a full-frame camera. I have a 24-105 f/4 L, a 14mm Rokinon, and a Canon 50mm f/1.8. I snap lots of landscapes and night shots of the stars and wanted to take full advantage of the wide angled lenses I have.It's been about 12 hours since I unboxed my 6D and here are my initial impressions, mostly compared to a Canon 60D, which I really liked: - the body feels about the same as the 60D - the button layout takes getting used to, esp. for a 60D user. They've moved the delete button to where the play/review button used to be. Bad move, IMO - the shutter is buttery smooth, especially on 'silent mode' - the high ISO performance kicks ass; much less noise than the 60D - built-in lens aberration correction means one less step in Lightroom - HDR looks promising, but I have not had a chance to test. Wish it had more manual control, e.g. take more than 3 snaps. I expect I'll use bracketing and then post-process my HDR - GPS seems to work just fine, but it's a bit of a battery drain - WiFi options look good -- I can take photos remotely from my Android phone and also upload pix directly to my 'puter, too. - Build quality looks good. I have abused my 60D in all kinds of wet and frozen environs, and it has prevailed. I expect the same if not more from the 6D - I miss the articulated screen - I wish the Menu button was on the right hand; they've moved it to the left side, requiring the left hand to push it - I like the menu options to choose the ISO range AND the minimum shutter speed against the ISO. Nice. Wish it went faster than 1/250, as I shoot a lot of action shotsSo from the above, you might think I'd give the 6D a mixed review. On the contrary, I am *very* happy to make this investment. The upgrade to the full-frame is amazing, the crispness and low-noise improvements in the Digic 5 are great, and the GPS and Wifi features are a nice touch.Definitely move to the 6D if you have a 60D or a Rebel and want something better.

She is, objectively speaking, an excellent amateur photographer. We have been considering upgrading from our 4 year old Canon T1i for about a year to a full-frame camera. The thoughts of buying the 5D Mark ii were not appealing because of its age and the 5D Mark iii was just too out of reach for an amateur photographer. The 6D does everything we need it to do and then some and was significantly less expensive than the 5D Mark iii. The ISO range is just so much better from what she was used to and was able to almost completely move away from flash photography indoors, eliminating the shadows that were almost always cast by the flash. Plus, the weight difference for someone that is small in stature is very appealing to my wife as well. Overall, the 6D has been the perfect purchase for us.

When the original Digital Rebel came out I bought it, took a lot of photos, but felt I wasn't getting what I got with film.  I couldn't blow up the shots to the same size.  I wasn't able to get quite the low-light performance I could get from ISO1600 film.  And it wasn't full-frame.Then I met my wife, started a family and never had time to get back to photography.  So my 28-105 IS zoom and 100-300 IS zoom and my Digital Rebel and film cameras sat in the closet.  Then I got an iPhone and started shooting pictures of the kids from the iPhone and mailing them directly to friends and family or posting them straight to facebook.None of the non-digital-SLRs offered much beyond what the iPhone offered.  The only full-frame digital SLR that fit my lenses was the 5D costing ~$3,500.  I just couldn't justify the cost because with my iPhone in my pocket I just wasn't going to shoot that often.The 6D changed all that.  For $2000 I get a camera that matches what I used to do with film and lets me pull my photos up over Wifi and email them or post them to FB instantly.  That and I'm getting better low-light performance than I could have ever gotten with film, my previous Digital Rebel, or my iPhone even with its flash.I was initially disappointed the 6D didn't have a flash, but once I started shooting in auto-ISO mode under standard house lighting, my disappointment went away.  The low-light performance is night and day better than what you can get with an iPhone even with the iPhone flash.Wifi took a minute to set up and figure out, but once I did I am now able to see all my photos on my iPhone anytime the 6D is turned on.  I tried the remote shooting feature, but the defaults make it pretty unusable because it auto-focuses after you snap the photo... useless.  But I believe that is configurable.I can't really compare the speed or autofocus to anything other than the original Digital Rebel or my earlier film bodies.  It obviously beats those.The beauty of this camera is because I can quickly share the photos, I actually pull it out from time to time rather than it gathering dust in the drawer and always pulling out my iPhone.  For that reason alone, I'm thrilled with my purchase.  My passion for photography has been revived.

I knew a full frame wasn't going to make my work better...so I had no desire to go full frame. That said, when I needed a new backup camera the price and ISO abilities of the 6D was a no brainer.

You can take a couple of test shots and then view them to see if you got the exposure just the way you wanted it.  I highly recommend the 6D.

I had tried one of the older rebels when they first came out and after 1.5 years of inconsistent images and not loving the feel of the camera I sold it. I thought maybe dslrs were not for me and got a canon powershot s95. I did love this camera and still use it, but since I am traveling so much I wanted to once again research and buy a dslr.I ended up getting a nikon d500 kit in December 2012. I chose it based on the great reviews I had read about it. I really tried working with it but found the majority of the shots I took were blurry. The shots that did come out were fabulous, maybe a tad soft but still very nice. The problem was it did not get these good shots consistently. I took it on a couple of trips and found that I got better results with the powershot s95. I got a better lense for the Nikon, worked with it a bit more and still didn't have any better luck with clear images. I sold it May 2013.Since I had been getting more into photography, I thought I would research dslrs once again. My main need was consistent quality images. I decided to stick with canon since I am familiar with the system and prefer the more saturated colors this brand produces. I also wanted a camera that could geotag my images because I like to use that feature in instagram. I went to my local camera shop and the guy who helped me strongly recommended a Nikon, which was not a dslr but a good point and shoot. Sorry I don't recall the model. I tried it. i also looked at the Canon SL1. I really did not like the Nikon at all but was very intrigued with the Canon SL1 because it was such a small and light dslr. I did take some shots and the images looked pretty good. I then looked at the Canon 6d. The size almost put me off because I do travel a lot and thought it might be too heavy to haul around. I picked it up and took a couple of shots and it was pretty much over after that. I loved the feel of it immediately. The images I took there at the camera store made up my mind. I am not a pro but the depth of field I got without really trying was amazing. The geotag feature was definitely a factor in my decision. I also like the wifi feature. I was able to set the camera up and take group pictures from my iPhone. The ability to email photos from camera via the cell is another great feature.The image quality is fabulous and consistent. The ability to take quality images in low light situations is a definite bonus. I do not miss the flash at all. The size and weight are not a problem and worth the images I get with it.

I've been mainly shooting on the 7D for most of my career, and have shot a good bit on the Nikon D800. The 6D is a camera that I feel has the feature set I most care about. I love the GPS and WIFI features, those are really important for me, not for my professional work at this point, but more for my personal work. (Although I could see it being very useful for scouting new locations, etc.)The camera seems to have a nice build quality, and I like the fact that it is full frame. I wish Canon full frame DSLRs had the ability to auto detect and auto crop if an ASP-C lens was put on. As of now, Canon full frame DSLRs can't use ASP-C sized lenses. I think this is a shame and a waste. The Nikon D800 has the ability to use and leverage ASP-C sized lenses. (Canon, fix this please.)Another bad mark for the camera compared to the Nikon D800/600 is that it does not have the dynamic range, or the ability to pull and push highlights and shadows. Nor does it have the resolution. I didn't think this mattered until actually shooting on the Nikon D800, there is so much information in the shadows and highlights that I never had to shoot HDR. Never. I would shoot brackets, but never actually had to use more than one still to get the exposure I wanted.Besides those two ticks when compared to Nikon, its a solid camera. The WIFI function works great, although could be a bit better. Auto focus could be better.Other features I would want. The ability to shoot 3.5K video. An additional SD card slot. Audio monitoring.

Shields", "ReviewID": "R2NZ58FDJB0B6I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Normally selling on Amazon for $1899, I purchased this when it recently dropped to $1575. I've done extensive research back and forth between this and the 5D MkIII. The 5D is an incredible rig but I wasn't looking to spend over $3000 for full frame for my needs.  I own a Canon 7D and I'm extremely happy with it, however I was missing the inherent advantages in full frame sensors I really wanted.A few \"drawbacks\" to consider. I put that in quotes because I don't see them as drawbacks so much since you need only recognize what purposes this 6D rig is intended for.1) It only shoots 4.5 frames per second. The 5D fires 6 fps.  Whoopie doo. If you're using this to shoot portraits and landscapes and stills, shot speed is really irrelevant. If I'm going to shoot sports or fast action, I have my 7D ripping at 8 frames per second anyway, which is faster than even the 5D. With my 70-200mm f2.8 IS2 in broad daylight, it's unstoppable. So I don't need a full frame to cover that situation.2) It only has 11 Auto focus points. Yeah, the 5D has 61. Let's celebrate. Again, if you're shooting portraits and not trying to autofocus track a cheetah or a Drew Brees touchdown pass, 61 autofocus points doesn't add anything to your repertoire. I'm NOT saying it can't handle action, you'll just have to work more to crack the shots off since the camera cant track it as well itself the way the 5D can. With portraits, just use the center cross point to target your subject, press the shutter release half way, lock target, recompose the frame how you want it and fire. It's not a big deal. Congrats, you just saved $2000.3) It only has 20MP and the 5D has 24MP. Frankly, who cares. At this resolution, and extra 4MP in 99% real world terms makes jack squat difference. If you're blowing your shots up to 20 feet by 30 feet, go buy a medium format camera ;-)With it's built in WiFi, the 6D has an advantage over the 5D. If you want WiFi on the 5D, you'll have to spend an  extra $600 to buy Canon's WiFi accessory on top of the $3500 you shell out for the camera itself. The EOS app for your iPhone is pretty cool too on this 6D with full remote camera operation available.So here's the summary. The 5D and 6D both perform on par with each other in terms of resolution and image quality. They both have equally excellent low light and high ISO performance. If you're looking at Nikon too, you need to google the independent tests done between canon full frame and nikon full frame low light/high ISO comparisons. Canon wins the noise and sharpness battle handily. Shooting at 6400 ISO and having virtually no noise in the image is amazing. Can't do that on my 7D or any other crop sensor rig for that matter.If you shoot weddings, indoors, or less than ideal lighting situations and don't like using a flash (like I dont) then you need to go full frame and the 6D is spot on for this typical use.I would HIGHLY recommend the Canon 6D. Just make sure you're buying it for the right applications and I promise you will not be disappointed in the least.My lenses used on both rigs are: Tokina 11-16mm f2.8, Sigma 35mm f1.4 ART, Canon 85mm f1.8, Canon 70-200mm f2.8 IS2, Tamron SP 90mm Macro f2.8", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera!", "Author": "Steph", "ReviewID": "R2BDF1159GF7EU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this camera!

It's the most expensive single piece of photography hardware I own...so far. All my bodies before this were APS-C size processors so I knew at some point I would have to jump into a full-frame camera. I recently got the chance to shoot a safety poster project for a large utility company and the posters were going to be printed 36\"x48\". The T3i was the best I had at the time so I finally knew I needed a pro camera to do more than portraits and weddings.I spent several sleepless nights trying to decide on what to do but kept coming back to the 6D. The $1,900 price tag was a real problem but I worked it out, took a deep breath and placed the order. Then came the battery grip, extra batteries, and chargers but I am as happy as a pig in poop with this camera. As soon as I shot my first 50 test images I knew I had made the right decision.Compare the feature set of the EOS 6D compared to the Rebel series and you'll see there's no frill on this workhorse. I have large hands and I have no problem using any button or knob on the camera during a shoot. The camera is a little heavier but I personally like a camera that has a solid feel to it so I can't call the weight a negative.The shutter sound is different and there's even an option to lower the shutter sound to near silence. The mode setting knob is like my old film cameras in that it has to be pulled up to change the settings. I had trouble once in a while with my T3i when I would accidentally bump it out of Manual to some auto setting I didn't want. Not a problem with this camera.All my Canon, Sigma, and Tamron lenses worked except my Sigma 18-250mm zoom. I didn't realize it when I originally bought the lens but it was only for the APS-C cameras. I love that lens. It was as heavy as a brick but razor sharp so I'll probably save my pennies up and buy another one for the 6D. I carry the T3i as a backup with that lens on it.I could go on and on about this camera so I'll leave you with this: believe all the positive hype about this camera and when the time comes for you to move to the full-frame cameras, take a serious look at this one.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great pictures", "Author": "Ricardo", "ReviewID": "R1ON450MA5P8ZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You don't need to be a pro to use this camera.

Most Lenses produce 'Vintage\" color or say \"cinematic\" colors. In other way the look of old color photo. apparently It's is also lens dependent. while it created the mood of the light in the images it may not be ideal for everyone. This effect is extreme with 24-105L lens. all photos will have a dark brownish tint. Its again lens dependent or a White Balance dependent. This is with Auto WB. Its an interesting result overall.The best way to check will be to evaluate photos posted in flickr or other sites. Check pictures taken with the same lens example 5DMk3 and this.  Also pixel-peeper.com is a good site to evaluate. select various combinations for lens and camera . most photos of 6D will have this \"vintage' feel to it. Images simply looks it is a very old color photo taken with a film camera. no vivid or vibrant colors like 5DMay be its a \"trick\" from Canon to give a \"Film Simulation\" feel to the pics as \"film simulation\" is the new trend in digital world to make feel like a film image. may be an \"old film look\"...:) its interesting though.Other interesting factor is \"slight under exposure\" in many outdoor shots. comparing pics on a another boy with same lens and settings results slightly dark pics.. not a big deal..Another thing to consider is that while higher ISO is good to 'brighten' the dark scene it may not be ideal for all times. To get the \"actual\" light of the scene with good DR but without grain as proved any ISO above 1000 or so will degrade the pic color and quality and tonality. That is where the help of a flash helps even a weaker one to fill the scene and combine the ambient light without looking as a  flash shot. Lack of flash is disappointment when everything else is ideal.Overall its a  great Camera.

I immediately returned it.This has since happened to me twice in the last six weeks from Amazon (I need a back-up camera, but keep getting used ones that are advertised as new, so I return them).When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card. It just shows how many \"clicks\" are on your shutter, in your camera. If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!Because this has happened to me so often, I am sure it is happening to thousands of people, without them knowing it. It would probably be very tough to tell if an item is used (unless it arrived dirty or damaged), but with cameras it is very easy to tell. Do not pay full price for a used camera!

So instead of a 70-200 2.8 lens, you can get the F4 for half the price. You can use the 24-70 F4 IS rather than the F2.8 IS II for half the price.

The plastic top plate fades in to the magnesium alloy so smoothly that you can hardly tell they are different materials.+ Rubber grip stays on the camera tightly much better than some other canons have in the past, doesn't peel away.+ Wifi is more than just a gimmick.. The phone connectivity is very useful (especially since there is no swivel screen), and the uploading features are well done.+ Mode Dial now rotates 360 degrees indefinitely+ Delete - Playback - Navigation buttons can all be used with one hand. Much more convenient button layout overall.+ Zooming in your pictures is a much different task than it used to be, but more fluid overall.+ Top scroll wheel is extremely accurate and fluid+ Very lightweight compared to other full frames", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 6D- Good first tries", "Author": "Coquille", "ReviewID": "R1APZ01P514CD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After first tries it feels as expected: Light body, easy to take, very good resolution on medium ISO, pretty accurate \"AF quick\" mode while live view.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but not great camera", "Author": "Doctor C", "ReviewID": "R16FG667GAUNTH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As I am \"in between\" cameras right now, I thought I'd give the other side a try.  I am in fact a long time Nikon user.  I recently parted ways with my Nikon D600 (due to some sensor spot issues), a camera that along with its updated form, the D610 (no sensor issues) is the direct competitor to the Canon 6D.  If you're on here, you probably already know this, but the 6D and the D610 are Canon and Nikon's offerings to \"affordable\" full frame cameras.  Each does things their own way and of course, being a Nikon guy, I'm much more familiar with and desire the layout on the Nikon more than the Canon, but for the sake of this review, I did not hold that against the Canon.My goal in using a 6D for an afternoon was to see whether it offered enough to jump ship.  I readily admit I'm biased, but I'm sure I'm not the only Nikon person wondering whether the grass is greener (or whiter) on the other side so fanboys from both sides may not like what I have to say.  Like many D600 users, I was frustrated by a problem that Nikon didn't address correctly (at least at first), but there is no denying the sensor on the D600/D610 is brilliant.  My choice at the moment is between Canon 6D, D610, and possibly Nikon D800.At first glance, the 6D is a nice hefty camera.  I can't say I'm a fan of the wheel behind it and prefer the front/rear selection wheel on the D600/D610 much better, but I'm sure Canon people might say the same about Nikon.  Back in the Rebel XTi vs. Nikon D80 days, I felt the same way and that's why I chose Nikon.The 20MP sensor on the 6D is easier to work with than the 24MP files of Nikon, but I actually started liking more MP's for cropping and also I felt more dynamic range on the D600/D610 images at least in the lower ISOs.  I give the edge to Nikon here on purely image quality.Wifi/GPS - clearly Canon wins here.  Nikon has neither except for an addon.  I have no need for Wifi, but the GPS would be nice.Flash system:  Nikon all day.  The pop-up flash is missing on the 6D which at first might be laughed at, but there have been many times when my D600 and I were just out and about with a 50mm lens and needed just a touch of -2 EV fill flash when shooting at ISO 3200 and the mighty popup flash worked like a charm.  Not to mention using the popup flash as a trigger for remote flashes.Video - I got some nice video with the D600; however, on the D600, you can't change the aperture while shooting video.  This is because (don't quote me on this) the aperture mechanism and the mirror mechanism on the Nikon can only be used one at a time in order to make the lenses backwards compatible).  I also found the 6D autofocusing in video mode to be much smoother.  It is what it is.SD Cards-  I was horrified to find only one in the 6D.  The D600/D610 have 2 slots.  For general shooting this may not be a big deal but SD cards do become corrupted in time.  I for one wouldn't dare to shoot a wedding without having dual card slots.  Much like the Nikon Df, that is a deal breaker for me.AF system:  I used to think the D600 spots were too few and clustered in the center and the 6D is about the same except they have less points.  For still pictures, I prefer Nikon's.So in conclusion, if you're in the Canon sandbox (have your Canon glass and such) and want to go full frame, I think this is a very nice upgrade from the 60D /7D world.  Full frame is the sweet spot for affordability and the best image quality in my opinion.  If you're an angry Nikon D600 owner, I don't think the grass is greener on the other side though the features on the 6D are nice.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing!

It was an upgrade from a canon rebel camera. It is in many ways the exact same camera as the 5D mark iii camera main difference being the cost.Pros: High ISO capabilities, Auto mode that sets just about everything for you to get the needed lighting (do watch out for this if you are going to leave you ISO on auto cause it will get grainy around 1200 ISO area.) When choosing your Raw formate or jpeg size it gives you a pixel x pixel size. There is also an app you can get for you phone and sync it to your camera and use it as a remote trigger which is a little confusing to learn how to set up so I recommend watching a youtube video on how to do it for the first time than its easy to use whenever you want to use it.Cons: Shooting video with AF is complicated as you have to push the AF-ON button and hold it while it focuses during shooting and you will hear the sound of your camera focusing during the video playback. No on camera flash, little difficult to transition to from a rebel since there are more buttons and features available to use.Overall: I would recommend the camera who has the money to spend on it but not enough to get the higher end cameras.

The 5-star reviews are just so much cheerleading and the 1-star reviewers are just venting about something that does not pertain to the product (shipping, returns, & etc.). I love this camera, so consider this a troll.I want to make two points.First, ignore reviews that say this is a bad camera. There are only bad photographers using inappropriate equipment. This is NOT a sports camera. But it is an OUTSTANDING low-light camera. Blows the doors off Nikon. And, still, it has acceptable high-speed performance.Second, a warning! This is a full-sensor camera. I almost ruined this camera because I mounted a crop-sensor lens on it. The crop lenses intrude further into the body and interfere with the mirror. A lens with a red dot is a full-sensor lens. A lens with a white square is made for crop-sensor bodies. Some cameras have both. Just make sure to use an appropriate lens or you could trash your camera. Do not under any circumstances mount a lens with a white square on a body with only a red dot. You've been warned.As for controls, I love it. Way more simple than my 7D, fewer buttons and whatnot. It doesn't have a joy stick. I always hated the joy stick. And on some cameras the thumb wheel can be depressed as you would a joy stick. Which means you mean to turn it, but you press it. This camera has a thumb wheel AND a directional control. No fiddling with a joy stick and no chance to accidentally press the wrong thing.Picture quality is excellent. I can take pictures of my critters, in the house, at night, with just a table lamp, and still they can come out too bright and a bit too warm. Still, this is a great low-light camera.I thought I'd miss a flash just for filling in, but I don't miss it at all.Overall I'd give it 6 stars because it fits with how I shoot. Your results may vary.Update: This truly is an awesome camera. I've taken pictures indoors, at night with just a glow from a fireplace, no flash, and they came out fantastic! As far a flash goes, okay, I kind of miss the built-in on my 7D for fill-in, but not much.Bottom line, this is a great, all-around, pro/enthusiast camera.Now a word about focus points. The 7D has 19 cross-type focus points. The 6D has 1. What does this mean? Old SLR cameras had a sliding focus system. The image was split in the middle horizontally and the bottom and top slid from side to side. You needed a vertical object (flag pole) to achieve proper focus. When the pole was no longer split, you had focus. Likewise, you could have a vertical split. Canon uses both in their cross-type focus points, kind of. So, you'd think you'd want the 7D's 19 cross-type focus points vs the 6D's 1. Well, not so fast. Some cameras have dozens of focus points, which is great if you're a button fiddler. For all practical purposes most of us focus and recompose. Align the 1 main point (You don't have to do this. It focuses pretty well regardless.) and then recompose the shot. This is the way photographers have shot since day 1.But you can still choose any of the 9 focus points and get excellent results if, say, you don't want to recompose. Compose the shot so one of the focus points is on the subject's eye, say, and you'll get a shot that is in perfect focus. Better than the cross-type? Unless you have a scientific lab, you can't tell.So don't get hung up on specs and whatnot. If you want blinding multi-shot speed. Get the 7D. If you want a good, all around camera, with incredible low-light capabilities; i.e. you can use it indoors and out without extra flash, this is the clear winner.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great quality, especially in low light, but missing some features", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R3G8W27BPO6YJ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First things first, the camera takes great pictures and is one of the best around in low light performance.

These reviews are for individuals which have NOT purchased the product and are weighing on the pros & cons..not for people which have already purchased the product and want to FEEL GOOD by talking up their purchase/give unhelpful reviews because it does not confirm their beliefs....That said, I can't say enough about the capabilities of this camera in low light, however if you use flash to set the exposure and/or shoot in situations where ISO is 100-800 you would be wasting your money on this camera. Especially between 100-400 ISO no differences in photo quality even up to large prints.. Contrary to popular opinion there is no Bokeh advantage for full frame sensor cameras. To make up the difference you just use a shorter focal length on your APS-C camera to get the same results. For example, using a 50-150mm zoom for an aps-c body comes within a whisker of replicating focal length an bokeh effect of the 70-200mm on a full frame camera body. If you dont believe me then check out the DOF at: [...]But I must say it amazes me that ISO 25800 is usable... 25800 on the 6d compares to between ISO 3200-6400 on my 50d/APS-c sensors.

Is the image quality really that much better than T3i? Yes. So why 3 stars?The exposure meter is wrong. At least in my copy of 6d. In the bottom center of the viewfinder, is the exposure indicator (meter), The way I shoot the picture, is using manual, I set the desired ISO, f stop, then I adjust the shutter speed based on the exposure meter in the viewfinder, to keep the metor indicator to point at the \"0\". This way worked perfectly for T3i, I would get perfect exposure and normal histogram. However, on my copy of 6d, when the exposure meter pointing at the zero, the histogram of the picture taken shows significant left shift(meaning significant loss of white-->underexposure). After taking close to 1000 shots, the results showed that I needed to adjust the shutter speed to make the exposure meter +2EV in order to have a balance histogram. Yes, you could fix underexposure in photoshop or any photo editing software, but I just didn't expect a $2000 camera would have this kind problem, even my T3i had better metering system.I'm not sure if I'm the only one has this problem. If other 6d owners have similar problems, please feel free to post here. I'm not sure if I want to send it back to Amazon for another copy or try to send it to Canon. I'm very disappointed.I bought the camera with the lens kit. I wonder if the body-only 6d would be any different.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon what are you up to?", "Author": "A. Sun", "ReviewID": "RI6Q1NYF4AS3F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Updated on 12/30/12**Original post**I got this camera last week, I do like 6D itself, if you don't compare to D600, not to mention D600 kit below 2k.Canon really try to take away as many functions and performance as possible and test our limit.The only reason I am still using Canon is because I had a Canon APSC and I don't want to sell all my lenses, also I like the colors Canon produces too.6D itself is nice nevertheless. The construction is more than enough for a amateur. My 40D can handle Alaska trip and snowboarding photography no problem, so I expect 6D will be better.Some people worry about the top being plastic, it doesnot feel like plastic at all, you won't notice it if you didn't know ahead.AF at night is slightly better than 40D, but I won't describe as fast. In the morning they perform equally.Pros: compare to 40DSmall, light, with Wifi and GPS.Silent mode.Able to shoot Movie.Screen size and colors.Cons: compare to D60011 AF pointsNo build in Flash light !!!!1 slot SD CardNo headphone jack.1 axis electronic level (d600 has 2)lower frame rateNo hot shoe coverNo LCD Screen coverNo light sensitive LCD (No auto-brightness)Live view setup time longer than D600Silent mode cannot control when to release mirror.D600 has more info display in viewfinder ex: AF, remain pictures available, light meter mode (center, bracket ...), & flashlight!!Pros vs D600:WiFi GPSNo Oil/Dust-issue risk yet. (Better quality control?)-3 EV AFCompare to D600 minus the lens which is only ~1500, there is almost NO reason to buy 6D if you are new to photography. You might say you don't need function xxx or this or that, but its like you are willing to pay a toyota for a price of BMW and claiming you dont need the horse power and navigation.Overall, 6D gets the job done and actually decently, but it is not an exciting camera when competitors are able to offer more.Don't tell me you don't compare cost and performance when you buy a car or electronics.If it was ~$100 to $200 lower than D600 I would recommend this and gave it 5 star.***I have to address here, Canon also lock your none-factory battery. You can still use it, but it won't show on the battery meter.Also the charger will not show you if it is fully charged or not. I left two of my generic batteries on my Canon charger for whole night and it still showed 75% (indicator flashing) charged.anyone has this problem?***UPDATES***Handling: size is smaller than 40D and 5D3, I don't have big hands, 40D fit perfectly in my hand, 6D is still pretty good, but 5D3 is too heavy and bulky.Construction/interface: 40D is more solid, I don't really like the 2 dials designs in 6D, the inner dial is very plastic and not responsive. The \"Play\" and \"Magnify\" buttons are a bit confusing there. 40D/5D3 joystick is more favorable.But, 6D is still 100x better than those rebel series for sure.6D Screen is better than 40D.**UPDATE #2 **WIFI function is useful but not user friendly, it is NOT simple as like setting up Network connection on a Windows 7, or setup a internet connection through a router. In fact, you need to setup a new account in 6D for every smartphone you want to connect, and in every setup you use different password and name for that single smartphone. This is NOT where you give a name and password so all your friends with the name and password can view your image.However this is a software issue so hopefully Canon will improve this a later on** UPDATE #3 12/30 **After few thousand shots Canon 6D is handling the job quite well, it has high dynamic range, good ISO performance and OK battery life if you don't have WIFI or GPS on all the time. The colors are not over saturated and skin tone is pleasant with the kit lens or sigma 35 1.4. File sizes are around 22mb each and I am using SanDisk 64G 45mb/s no problem on writing speed at all. However I also had a chance to play with D600. I have to say D600 almost outperform 6D in every little things and that does add up. D600 comes with hot shoe cover, LCD cover, auot-brightness LCD that turns the LCD info background into white in the morning and black at night. Live view setup time is also shorter than 6D which means shorter waiting, LCD size looks bigger too. 6D weight is slightly lighter, but D600 is not heavy at all compare to 40D or 5D3, its still within my range.When I compared the viewfinder, 6D comes short too. 6D only displays battery, ISO, F-stop, shutter speed and available continuous frames. Where else D600 has everything PLUS AF setting, total remaining pictures available, light meter mode (center, bracket ...), & flashlight. That means when I want to change my AF setting (One Shot, Al Focus, Al Servo) or Light meter setting (center, bracket, wieght..) on my 6D I need to move my eye away from viewfinder and look at the top screen instead of checking the setting through viewfinder. Canon can't you do better than this?Back to what I've said, unless you are already using Canon and like Canon's colors, D600 is overall a better choice in terms of performance(if the dust/oil issue is not present in D600).**Please feel free to ask questions if you think it is not helpful so I can address more on the 6D to help you make your decision.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "The high ISO", "Author": "Sumanta Banerjee", "ReviewID": "R2QLBXEZKEU3GV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The high ISO is too good.It enables me to take low light photography even the lens is having not enough f (f number higher than 3).I just got the lens.

Meriwether", "ReviewID": "R3PUN8TFZ7MQL5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "On the plus side, it's lighter and much quieter than my previous 5D. It can focus in much dimmer conditions.Auto ISO is lens length aware; it pushes the ISO up or massively up to achieve somewhere around 1/40 sec with a 17mm lens and 1/125 sec with 105 mm lens. I would like to alter the bias, though. Shooting sharp images with a 17mm lens can have shutters of 1/20 to 1/15 sec, while I prefer 1/180 to 1/250 for 105 and up. Auto ISO is not aware of whether image stabilization is turned on or off.Here's where things started going down hill. WiFi problems:The camera can join an existing WiFi network, which Canon calls, \"Infrastructure Mode.\" It can create it's own WiFi hotspot, which Canon calls, \"Camera Access Point Mode.\" Finally, it can participate in a peer-to-peer WiFi network which Canon calls, \"Ad hoc Mode.\" Here's a chart of what devices can use which network systems:Smart Phone:__ In-camera Hotspot \u221a, WiFi Access Point \u221a, Ad hoc XComputer:_____ In-camera Hotspot X, WiFi Access Point \u221a, Ad hoc \u221a*Printer:________ In-camera Hotspot \u221a, WiFi Access Point \u221a, Ad hoc XTV Screen:_____ In-camera Hotspot X, WiFi Access Point \u221a, Ad hoc XOther camera:_ In-camera Hotspot ?, WiFi Access Point ?, Ad hoc ? - didn't have a second 6D to testWhen it comes to wireless networking, the camera is a control freak. Rather than joining a WiFi network and peering and presenting a service, the camera requires you to create a \"connection.\"  You have to manually define the network and device parameters of the connection for each type; be it \"EOS Utility\" on one or more of your computers, \"EOS Remote\" app on a smart phone, etc.  That means that if you want three devices to be able to access the camera, all on the same WiFi network, you'll need to enter the same WiFi password three times, once for each device \"connection.\"The \"Connection\" is specific to both the network and the device. You can only have a total of three \"connections\" for any given device type (computer, phone, etc.) Every time you encounter a new wireless network, say a change of hotels, you'll need to over-write one of your connections to re-establish it with this new network; even if it's the same laptop.  Or create an ad hoc (peer-to-peer, computer-to-computer) network each time you want to wirelessly transfer files. Why the camera can act as a hotspot for the mobile device, but not the laptop is a mystery; but it sure is annoying.Frequently when accessing \"Wi-Fi function\" if you've previously set up a \"connection\", even if that connection is not active, the default question on screen is, \"Exit.\" It is not immediately clear to me by the context what is being asked. It means, \"Exit your current connection.\" I'm typically trying to determine the state of the network when I make it to that screen. Kill the network isn't the button I want to be default.I had hoped that the camera could use a VPN to access workstations while shooting remotely. It could have opened up a world of real-time creative collaboration. No, Canon hasn't figured out normal WiFi networking, let alone anything remotely advanced. The best Canon could do was a Canon-branded image bucket and gateway that allows you to upload down-rezzed JPEGs and invite people to view them with email.Using the WFTParing.app, which is the bit of software that allows you to initialize a \"connection\" with a computer, requires knowing this one trick: A Growl-like notification appears in the upper-right hand corner of the screen once the WFTPairing app finds an EOS camera. That looks for all the world to be just a notification; being flat, not 3D and zero interaction affordances, but it's actually a button that you must click in order to proceed to pair the devices. The \"notification\" button disappears (like a typical notification) after a few seconds and in order to get it back on screen, you'll need to restart the pairing process on the camera. Without clicking on the \"notification that's actually a button\" you're left having no way to proceed and no feedback on what to do next or if anything went wrong.On Mac OS X, you cannot have the system firewall turned on while initially trying to set up the WiFi connection for EOS Utility (using WFTParing.app.) However, once the camera and computer have registered a pairing, you can turn the firewall back on and still be able to pair.It takes seventeen separate actions to enable or disable either the WiFi or the GPS functionality. This is an annoyance as I plan to use the camera primarily in an underwater housing and transfer the files over WiFi rather than crack open the housing after each dive. But this means I really need to conserve battery, so turning on and off WiFi is something I'll be doing often. I put GPS and WiFi screens on the \"My Menu\" screen which significantly speeds up access.Since it's not explained in the WiFi manual, here's some terms I needed to look up:WPS: WiFi Protected Setup, I guess it's a proprietary Canon WiFi configuration protocol.WPS  (PBC): Push Button Connection, A button, like on a printer, that you can press to pair devices.WPS (PIN): Personal Identification Number, an 8-digit number, rather than just pressing a button, you use to facilitate WPS.Once EOS Utility has control of the camera, you do not.The WiFi graphic on the LCD blinks, which typically indicates a problem, whenever WiFi is working properly. It's right next to the GPS indicator, which blinks when it isn't working properly.Canon Software (shovel-ware):The installer wants to install nearly a gigabyte of exceedingly low-quality shovel-ware onto your computer (including the moribund Microsoft's Silverlight.)  It piles on useless things like PhotoStich, which Canon marketing thinks is necessary to maintain parity with their competitors, but not strongly enough to actually budget quality development towards.The EOS Utility and Digital Photo Professional (which, as of this writing, is the ONLY way to process Canon's new CR2 Raw files... correction, Apple Camera RAW now processes CR2.1, but still not Adobe Pre-CS6 or Dx0) can only be installed with a CD-ROM. This means if you've got a computer without a CD/DVD drive, like a MacBook Air, you've got problems. The software cannot be installed over \"Remote Disk.\" You cannot copy the installer over to the MacBook Air and run it locally either. You cannot download the software from Canon. I was able to get EOS Utility to somewhat work by copying the files over from a previous install, but I couldn't get the copied-over version of Digital Photo Professional to read the new CR2 files.New RAW format:The new Canon CR2 RAW files used in the 6D (and maybe 5D MIII) are different from the old CR2 files used for the last half dozen years. When I heard they where different, I assumed Canon had improved the format; like made the color depth 16 bits or some such. Well, sadly, the difference between the old CR2 and the new one is that Canon put encrypted data into the file so they can wrestle back a little more control over the Raw codecs. Rude.Camera functionality:The HDR feature is a major disappointment. As is the multi-shot noise reduction. Both live only in amateur-land and only create JPEGs.Focusing is glacially slow when using the screen rather than viewfinder (LiveView) if the camera is set to the default \"FlexiZoneAF\" and \"Live Mode\". However, although not perfect, you can switch the camera's LiveView configuration so that the parameter, \"AF Control\" is set to \"Quick mode\" which for a brief moment swings the mirror back into place so that the camera can use the much faster focusing method. This causes the screen to black out for a fraction of a second, but the difference in focusing speed more than makes up for it in my tests. (Thanks D. Alexander)Didn't come with a card. Seriously, a $2000 camera and they couldn't throw in a $5 card?* Creating an Ad hoc network on Mac OS X: In the AirPort status menu item, click, \"Create Network\" for a \"Computer to Computer\" network.  For some reason, I could only get WEP 128-bit encryption, and that's pretty insecure; so make sure the network is only live while an actual transfer or camera control session is going on.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Novice user, but still easy to figure out the basics", "Author": "Tina Russell \"sheltiepup\"", "ReviewID": "R1IQWR4ERPE18S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Im new at photography and am using this for casual use, I'm upgrading from a rebel, and I love that this has a lot of the basic , descript controls that can help me learn the camera.

In limited testing, the camera performed well at high ISO settings--one of the 6D's selling points.What's Not So Good?I took away one star for the following reasons: (1) Canon didn't even provide an SD card. For $1899, I would have expected an SD card. I realize that people who would buy this camera probably upgrade from a camera with an SD card, but many of Canon's older cameras use CF cards. Yes, an SD card is inexpensive; therefore, the lack of an SD card is worth 0.1 star. (2) Canon should have provided an on-camera flash as does Nikon. Yes, an external flash is superior, but this is a prosumer camera and prosumers sometimes need a flash for a candid picture.Don't let the loss of one star dissuade you.

I shoot almost exclusively raw. I use a flash infrequently with this camera. The low-light picture quality is very good. There is some noise in low light, but I expected that. Pictures taken with bounce flash look fine.The camera focuses quickly, and it captures a lot of detail even with less-than-ideal lighting.I shot some JPEGs. They look somewhat soft, but the JPEGs would be fine for web pages that do not require a lot of detail. I prefer to create my own JPEGs from raw images.The automatic white balance works well outdoors. Sometimes, I have to perform white balance correction in Aperture or Photoshop to account for indoor lighting.I've used the Wi-Fi capability in both peer-to-peer mode and in infrastructure? mode to transfer pictures to an iPad. It works as indicated in the manual. If you understand how to set up a Wi-Fi network, you will not experience any problems using these features.The camera works well in burst mode with raw images. I haven't measured the limits, but it's fine for my needs. I am using a Delkin 633x 16GB card. This card is made in Japan.The video doesn't continuously focus, and the manual confirms this fact. I don't shoot much video, so this was not a factor in my decision to purchase this camera.Overall, I am glad that I saved $1,000+ by purchasing the 6D as opposed to the 5D Mark III.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Downgrade from EOS 7d", "Author": "WilliWu", "ReviewID": "R20BACR0F761P9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I use my cameras mostly for wildlife photography and do quite a bit of telephoto shooting with 70-200, 300 and 600mm L lenses.

The Wi-Fi capability that allows remote shooting with my iPhone is so awkward to set up that I do not use it.

We also bought a Zoom H4n to get pro mic audio into this thing, and we bought a couple 64GB cards to use with it. To be honest, we haven't had time to really put it through the paces. But we will! I'm giving it a good rating just based on Canon's name and the research we did on this unit, which shows that it should perform well for shooting video.

On the 6D the buttons are less \"clicky\" and have a reassuring firm rubber press. The shutter also has less of the thump of the 5D.Unfortunately there are two things I really do not like about this camera:1. While you can program the DOF preview button to bring up the electronic level, another way the camera could be improved is by showing the electronic level at the top of the viewfinder so it could be displayed all the time. This would work much better for people who handhold their cameras. Currently the level disappears as soon as you press the shutter half way down. You also cannot program more easy to reach buttons like the AE lock button (which I don't usually use), only the DOF preview button.2. The buttons you use to zoom in when reviewing images on the LCD have been changed. Instead of the AE lock and AF point selection buttons, you now use the Main Dial button. I hate this and would like the option to toggle this back to the behaviour on the xxxD, x0D and 5D. The zoom button also seems pointless as it only zooms in by a single fixed amount.3. The GPS stays on and drains the camera battery even when the camera is off. I agree this is the desired behaviour if the GPS logging (sub option) is on. If this option is off then the GPS should switch off when the camera is switched off.The 150g weight reduction from the 5DMKII is great, as is the reduction in size. I can now carry the camera around all day without it hurting my neck or back.Also, the in-camera HDR is a great feature, I used it a lot on my last trip.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "I was thrilled to have this camera but I have to buy new lens because my EFS lens does not fit and ...", "Author": "Lin", "ReviewID": "R1SDKKLU0N6RJN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "just a little bit of inconvenience is that it does not come with a built in flash... and how I wish it is a drop lighter...", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Probably the Best Thing Ever", "Author": "The Spaghetti King", "ReviewID": "R2U1NIGOQZBU0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I have been using my Canon Rebel for the last 20 years to pick up on chicks at the club.

Right?  Anyway, let me start off by telling you that this is Kendall and Not Michelle, My beautiful wife / photogenic model.  She also runs the Business side of things and to me being on Amazon is like being a kid in a candy shop, so the account stays in her name.  Enough of that let's begin the review. My last new camera purchase was the canon 50D in the spring of 2009, Love that thing!  The mirror has seen almost 10G of action. Before that I had, or I should say have a Canon XSI (Canon 450D to yous is outside of the USA) purchased from Kits Camera in 2008, before they were bought out by Ritz Camera.  Ok, Ok enough of this history stuff.  But wait, there's more! I've owned several dozen 35mm cameras, And a 2 \u00bc Mamiya. Ok enough!!! What to say about this Canon 6D,  Well,,  I'd have to say is it is the best Camera that I've ever owned!  What's that You Say?  Nikon D600, D800, Canon 5D Mark III? What about them?I know, all the nerds say the Nikon is Better!  And I did almost go to the point of Changing loyalty.  And I also looked at what was available for non mirrored Cameras.  I looked at everything before spending $1,800.00 on a camera.  Like you, I don't have money falling out of my, um backside.  So I spent pretty much 1 \u00bd, 2 hours a night for  a couple of weeks looking for what would be best for me! As for Nikon, I was almost to the point of purchasing the D600 because of the VS 6D reviews. But, I have many nice Canon Lenses and a review by Ken Rockwell and other pro's changed my mind.  Check Ken out at [...] The Mirror less race is upon us.  This, I believe will be the next big thing in Photography.  In the next two to three years Mirror less cameras will be the only choice in the upper end of Videography/Photography.  Sony looks to be the leader with the NEX series, Panasonic for video.  But, if I wound up buying a mirrorless it would have been the Fujifilm X Pro 1.  Why? Because I really like the feel, the look, and how retro this camera is.  I did like the Olympus OM-D E-M5 too.Final Conclusion.I LOVE MY NEW 6D! Why did I give it 4 stars?  Because there is always something better! (5D mark III).Why did I choose this camera? Because pretty much all the crap I read and I have Canon Lenses and because I don't have money pouring out of my wazoo . The other and the main reason, Because of the Images I had found online and the test Images I have seen.  They say a picture says a thousand Bla. Bla. Bla.

The developers of Android and iOS (iPad/iPhone) implemented a feature that trickles up photos (and videos, in the case of Android/Google+) to a Web site where they can be sorted and shared. What would you do if you were adding a WiFi feature to a camera four years after the release of Android? Apparently, \"use an Android phone and copy the best features\" were not something that Canon's engineers did.It takes about an hour to configure the WiFi feature on this camera to do anything at all. Multiple manuals are involved, both on paper and in PDFs distributed on CD-ROMs(!). You need to connect the camera to a conventional personal computer (Mac or Windows) via a USB cable before you can even think about using WiFi. The USB connector is not the ubiquitous micro-USB of smartphones, Android tablets, Sony NEX and RX100 cameras, etc. It is an old-school mini-USB. So don't lose the cable that Canon supplies. Even if you're a happy user of Facebook, Flickr, Google+, Picasa, iCloud, and every other photo-sharing service on the planet you will need to create an account at Canon's photo-sharing service.Once you've got everything configured you can send photos up to Canon's proprietary service... one at a time. So instead of streaming them all to a hard drive on your computer or a Web site from which you can then look at them on a big screen you're supposed to pick the winners looking at the small screen on the back of the camera and then, one at a time, pick photos to be transmitted wirelessly.If you have WiFi turned on it is impossible to capture video. If you have WiFi turned on, it is impossible to plug the camera in via USB (it just silently fails).WiFi offers some peculiar features, e.g., the ability to send a photo to another camera, but not the features that you'd want, e.g., \"send everything to my desktop computer\" or \"send everything at 2000 pixels wide to Google+\".[On a lower level of bad design, the camera is heavily dependent on an up/down/left/right arrow control, as is the Canon 5D Mark III. On the 6D, however, the control is embedded inside the rear control dial and it is rather difficult to press the arrows. The software seems to be quite different from the software on the 5D Mark III and it will take some getting used to.]How does it work as a camera?
