Well I couldn't figure out how anyway.Using IE just adds to the memory load and reduces the reliability of the system.

The worst thing for me is that sound in the ActiveX control doesn't work properly with IE9 on Windows 7 (64). So for me, the camera has no audio in either direction. I ended up using third-party software rather than stick with the buggy built-in web interface, but as far as I can see, Foscam only supports sound through their own proprietary ActiveX control and none of the third-party tools support their custom sound interface.Bottom line: If all your PCs are old, or if you don't care about audio, then you'll love this camera.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good value but not as reliable as Foscam FI8918W", "Author": "RL", "ReviewID": "R2206MDLMKZR0C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have 4 FI8918W and 2 of these FI8909W units.  The 4 FI8918W all work well for over a year and I never had issues with transmission distance or reliability.Of the 2 FI8909W cams, one of them works reliably but the other developed transmission issues and locks-up after a period of a week.  I think I traced the lock-up to motion detection.  Initially within the first 6 months of use I never had any issues using the same setting/location and motion detection activity; however recently, I've either had to unplug the unit or turn off motion detection to have it work \"reliably\".  Unplugging the unit essentially rebooting the camera fixes the issue but if motion detection is left on, it will stop working after 3-4 days (photos/motion are being triggered and emails sent during this timeframe)and then I'll have to reboot by unplugging the unit.  So I've finally decided to turn off motion detection and after 1 week of use it hasn't locked up yet.If I didn't have a need for a thinner profile camera, I'd only purchase the FI8918W cameras.

None have worked very well for very long for various reasons. USB cameras typically require either a lengthy USB cable or a small and portable machine in the area you are going to be recording. This of course also means a power outlet is taken up and the space to house the machine. This is my last purchase in the hodge podge area. I had high hopes for this cam after reading the reviews but it just hasn't worked the way I had hoped.I purchased this camera in an attempt to find something that would perform better than the Logitech WiLife system I got in closeout, this gave constant connection drops via the ethernet over home wiring setup. The Foscam I8909W camera has good night vision but no way to turn off the LEDS. The power indicator and all the LEds are positioned on the front of the camera so if you want to point it outside the thing will blind itself. That is to be expected, though, since it IS a night camera. However, the power indicator and data transmit lights should be able to be turned off. Electrical tape does take care of this issue.Maybe this is just the camera I received but I can't get it to maintain a connection for anything. I have it pointed out a front window and constantly the connection drops. If I try to connect directly to the camera via IP I get extremely sluggish response times. Changing the resolution or FPS does not seem to help. It seems to have less issue when connected directly to my router but one would think the wifi would be able to handle the data being transmitted. The camera and router are no more than 25 feet apart with out any actual obstacles or walls in between the two. I have very few WAP's near me and the channel I'm on is only used by me so I don't think it has anything to do with interference.The cam does connect very easily to blueiris which I use for my recording system so it has that going for it.The focus for the camera is decent for it's price point. You aren't going to get super clear pictures or read license plates 30 feet away but if you just want to know if someone/thing has been into your yard or keep an eye on the family pet then this is fine for that.I'd say if you are thinking about this one then spend a bit more and get the newer PTZ camera with 720p output on it. Or simply take the plunge and get a Dahua IP Cam and go for POE (power over ethernet) Sadly, I got this one in the hopes of it working for my needed application of a thin camera in a tight space but it just doesn't seem to work for that.

I primarily use my iPad and avoided installation disk by using free iPad/iphone apps.  If you are interested in doing the same, do the following: 1) Connect the antenna, power adapter and network cable to the device.  2) Plug the power adapter in the wall and connect the network cable to your router and wait for the green light to come on and blink.  3) Run a free network analyzer app like \"Fing\" and note the new device ip address on the map.  It will probably say something like \"EchoStar Global\".  4) Use your web browser and type in the local ip address found with Fing.  It will be something like 192.168.10.104.  5) The camera menu should appear and you should log in using the Server Push option (non-windows). Most of these devices are default to \"admin\" with no password. If successful, you should see live video using the Live Video option.  6) Set up user info (user name and password) and your wireless info (SSID, etc.) through the device management menu options.  7) Disconnect the network cable from the router. The ip camera should pick up your network in a minute.  8) Use Fing again to find the wireless ip address.  It will be listed with a new name like \"B-Link Electronic\" and may have an address with a new three digit extension (like 192.168.10.105).  9) Enter that address in your web browser or set up a webcam viewer using a free app like \"Netcamviewer\".  Now, you're ready to view your camera on your internal network for monitoring pets, kids, etc.The camera is fairly straight forward.  The focus is manually controlled via a lens focusing ring. The firmware supports WEP, WPA and WPA2.  You can turn off the network light and control the resolution (320 vice 640 image size). It's got a fixed mounting holder and comes with wall screws.

So I've been adding more cams to our system, and decided I wanted one in our garage, so it has to pick up a solid signal through a couple plaster walls, and a thick garage door.  Given the environment, I knew I'd be pushing the limits of any WiFi cam, and on top of that, the cam needed to be compact. So I decided to try out the Tenvis Mini319w and the Foscam FI8909W.  Here's how they stacked up:> WiFi RangeTenvis - When I tested the cam in the house, all was fine.  But once it got into the garage and had to push through all the geographic obstacles, Tenvis had spotty reception at best. The video was stop-motion, and lost signal every few seconds.  Clearly, the issue is the barely 1\" tall antenna; it's just too small to break through and hold a signal.Foscam - The Foscam yielded similar results; pitch perfect in the house, and spotty in the garage.  At this point, one might think this particular setup just isn't possible; the conditions are just too difficult.Just for kicks - I put both my Tenvis JPT3815W and Foscam FI8910W) pan & tilt cams into the garage, and they also had a hard time staying connected at that range, and under those conditions.  Which leads me to the one area where Foscam Mini is truly superior to Tenvis Mini...> Replaceable AntennaTenvis - has a stationary, non-replaceable antenna.  To make matters worse, it only extends about 1\" above the camera housing; fine if your cam isn't far from your router, but downright terrible if the signal has to reach through any walls or obstructions.Foscam - some genius over at Foscam realized that, just because you want a compact cam, doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to replace the antenna. So I got myself a couple WIFI 10 dBi 2.4GHz Antennas, and voila -- my Foscam mini is now mounted in the garage and works flawlessly.  One antenna went on my router, the other went on my Foscam mini.**Note** - Foscam uses male antenna connectors.  I didn't realize this until after I bought 2 antennas with female connectors.  So I grabbed some old cable TV wire, clipped off a 3/8\" sliver of copper, filed it down to fit, and gently inserted it into the antenna's female connector.  Then I just connected the newly modified antenna to my Foscam mini -- presto -- instant Foscam compatible antenna for less than 5 bucks.> Image QualitySetting WiFi range aside, both cams have equally nice video; crisp, clean, good focus.> LensFoscam = 67\u00b0Tenvis = 57\u00b0That 10\u00b0 advantage for Foscam means it has a slightly wider viewable area than Tenvis.  The focal lengths appear to be the same on both; about 2cm - infinity.> IR LEDsTenvis = 21Foscam = 5Clearly the Tenvis has better night vision as a result.  But neither cam has the ability to turn OFF the LEDs manually.  Given how my cam is mounted, I really needed to be able to turn off those LEDs manually.  Since there's no way to do that under each cam's current firmware version, I just taped off all the LEDs on both cams with electrical tape.  I also taped off all visible markings and power indicators so the cams were just little black boxes with a lens.  It just makes them more stealth, plus, where I mounted the cams was causing the IRs to just blow out the video to white, since the IRs were bouncing back into the lens.  This is not a design flaw, it's just how things worked out with the way I needed the cams mounted.  Under normal conditions, the night vision works fine on both cams.  I have plenty of external lighting outside the garage, so the IR LEDs just weren't necessary in my setup.  The video from both cams look good at night, with or without the IRs functioning.  But keep in mind, you will need a minimal source of light elsewhere, if you blackout the LEDs like I did.> Software & InterfaceFoscam has it all over Tenvis in this department.  I have 2 different Tenvis cams, and the software on both is very crude and rudimentary.  It works fine, it just looks like it was programmed back in the 90's.  Foscam's interface, however, is pleasing to the eye, well laid out, straightforward, and very easy to use.  There's just no comparison; Foscam wins, hands-down.> SizeTenvis is basically 3.5\" square.  Foscam is about 2.5\" x 3.5\"  For my purposes, the shape and housing of Foscam fit better where I was mounting it.> Camera MountBoth Tenvis and Foscam suck in this department.  Foscam actually has great quality mounts for all their standard PTZ cams, but the one for this mini version just wouldn't stay in place; the ball joint kept sliding one way or another and wouldn't stay put, no matter how hard I tightened it. Just the weight of the cam alone was enough to make the mount drift out of alignment.  Garbage.Tenvis' mount is also crap. The one for this mini cracked with the first turn of the camera screw, rendering it useless.  And this seems to be a running theme with Tenvis, because their mount for my standard PTZ cam is equally crap.> Customer ServiceTenvis' customer service is iffy.  They seemed friendly enough, but there's definitely a language barrier, coupled with the time difference to China, and the fact that all communication is happening via email, and it all adds up to a tedious experience.I haven't had the need to call Foscam or use their customer service, in part because their User Interface is so good, that I don't feel the need for additional guidance. But I can say that, Foscam appears to have offices in Texas, and when I submitted my Best Offers to them on a popular auction site, both were accepted, and all email communique was highly professional and friendly. So if I ever run into problems, I feel more confident working with Foscam than Tenvis.> ConfigThese cams are not for beginners or the tech-phobic.  You need some knowledge of routing, WiFi, port forwarding and IP addresses to make these cams work.  It's nothing hard.  In fact, I never really read the instructions for any of them; I just jumped in and got the cams going on my system within 15 minutes.  The fine tuning and tweaking, naturally, took much longer.  But the initial setup is pretty easy.> A Word About Blue IrisI recently upgraded to Foscam Blue Iris Professional and it's a fantastic security cam suite.  Very easy to use, and you can control and tweak pretty much anything.  Works with most every IP cam, webcam, and even camcorders out there.  Very nice upgrade, particularly coming from Logitech WiLife, which was just crap.Bottom Line -- Tenvis mini is ok, if you don't mind the wonky interface, and your environment is pretty clean.  The video quality is good, provided you can maintain a reliable signal.  But the short antenna on the Tenvis mini ensures you're not getting very far from your router with it.  Foscam, with its replaceable antenna, is the way to go if your environment is more challenging.  Plus the user interface and customer service is just better than Tenvis.  I'd still buy another Tenvis if I needed a budget cam.  But if there's a deal to be had on a Foscam, I'll grab that one over Tenvis every time. IMO, Foscam is just better, no matter what style cam you're getting.  I sent back the Tenvis mini and kept the Foscam.  It's going strong as we speak, mounted in my garage with that long-range antenna.

It does not have great resolution or dynamic range, but does the job.  I placed mine at my front door under my covered porch.  We will see how it holds up outdoors, but it recieved no sun or rain where it is so it should be fine.  The exposure on this camera seems a bit quirky at first but you get used to it.  In my location I find that during the day the image is exposed correctly but when the night comes the image overall is dim until something moves in front of the IR lights then it is properly exposed.  It is just something you have to get used to, but it does have an autoexposure unlike other foscam reviews I read.  Once you find a happy compromise for the brightness and contrast settings you can leave them alone and do not have to change them twice a day as someone wrote.

I am not sure but I believe there is an older firmware that is not upgradable and does not support secure email servers.  I cannot comment on the wireless stability since I ran a cable to my location, but I would expect it to drop from time to time since it is wireless which is why I ran a cable.Probably my biggest disappointment about this camera is I wanted to recieve instant notification when motion was detected since they advertise that function, but when I set it up I realized that it records motion for 60 seconds then sends 6 snapshots in the email.  It still is useful but I wanted a notification before someone even hit the door bell.  Oh well I guess I was asking a lot.

I have two of the FI8910 pan/tilt models and one FI8909W.  They all use the same software, so getting to understand the basic setup is easily applied to the other cameras including the NON P/T FI8909W.  For the most part, these cameras work very well, even in MINIMAL LIGHT at night with the built in IR LED's.  There is a fair amount of barrel distortion from the inexpensive wide angle lens, but that is to be expected for a camera that sells for $100 or less. This is after all a security camera.I use the MOTION Detector and email options, and they work very well, once you figure out how to set it up.  The TEST email button is great to check settings prior to putting it ONLINE.  The only feature I wish these cameras had is a adjustable/selective motion alarm window rather than relying on the whole frame.....light changes in the morning and evening cause the camera to send erroneous ALARMS due to the light change.  I've tried lowering the sensitivity, but the problem is that it detects the whole frame, rather than selectively isolating a small area, like just an entry door.  Maybe an upcoming firmware revision will include this feature.The FTP feature works as advertised and was easy to setup, once you know the coordinates of your FTP server.If you are NOT a techie kind of person, you might enlist the help of someone who is....as the alarm, FTP settings and IP addresses can be confusing to someone not immersed in this on a daily basis.  Also, if you are on an ISP that changes your IP address often, you MUST subscribe to a Dynamic IP service....there apparently are no more FREE services, so figure a few $$ a month so you can get logged into your camera from outside your home/office, through the Internet - if that is what you want it for.  If you only use these cameras within the network of your home/office, NO DYNAMIC IP service is needed.  I do suggest once you setup the wireless IP address you go into your router and convert THAT dynamic IP address to a static IP, so it won't change if you unplug or loose power to your camera.  BTW, if you only want to send email alarm notification and snapshots during the alarm (settable) you do NOT need an dynamic IP service, the camera will send the email regardless of what IP address your WAN address is. These cameras require a DHCP IP address FIRST to setup and configure the camera via a wired LAN connection.  You can then assign the camera to a static IP and or PORT setting and use wireless if desired.  Again, if this is all confusing, you really need a techie person....maybe a 15 year old kid down the block could help.... LOL.BTW, I see Foscam now has a new series of camera with HD resolution (720P) rather than SD resolution (480i).  Not sure if this is really a great advantage for a security camera.  The pictures with the SD resolution are very good and easy to identify an object or persons within the frame of interest.

It even has a warranty!Reliable: I have two running 24/7/365, they have never dropped their connection and maintain a high frame rate (20FPS).Easy to set-up: Follow the instructions in the guide they give you. First you turn it on and plug it in, then you use the software they give you to find its IP Address. Then your browser takes over. It supports activeX (IE) AND it has sever push mode for FireFox! Server push mode is much better then activeX. It also has a mobile viewer for your phone. Using the settings on the camera's webpage you can toggle how it connects (via LAN or WIFI) and what network it uses. It takes about 5mins from start to finish to set-up this camera. They also send you a video tutorial CD. You don't need to watch it but if you want a comical Japanese to English translation then I suggest you watch it. Its got bad lip syncing and everything. Like a bad Japanese movie.Durable: Its very sturdy and has a metal base complete with mounting equipment. The camera can also withstand falls, as I found that out first hand when I mounted it improperly. The base is also extremely balanced, and the camera can fully stand up on its own with out any mounting or screwing down (which is perfect for tables and temporary positions).I love this camera. I bought three of them to complete my home security system. Of course its native software sucks! Your not paying for the software, your paying for the camera! You obviously have to use it with good third party software to really take advantage of it. I use my camera with ISPY CONNECT. Its a wonderful FREE program complete with motion tracking, email alerts, it runs programs and plays sounds on alerts, it has facial recognition, image recognition, everything. You can connect as many cameras as you want to it and it even has a handy wizard to help you set everything up. You can even connect to their severs (for a small monthly fee)so you can stream the cameras to any device in the world!

The update process was flawless (make sure to do it from a wired connection). The configuration process was relatively easy as well. The \"IP Camera Tool\" software (included with the camera) used to locate the camera(s) on the network works very well and web browser interaction (SeaMonkey, Firefox, and Internet Explorer) worked equally as well (both wired and wireless).The Foscam forums have a wealth of helpful information. I especially appreciated the topic(s) discussing how to disable the embedded My.Foscam.org DDNS setting in the firmware configuration. This is otherwise not configurable through the normal user interface (UI). Really, must this be a default with the inability to simply disable it? The not-so-savvy users could open the cam for full viewing by the general public if they are not careful. Read more about this in the post at: [...]Update: Amazon will not post the link, so just go to the Foscam forum and search for \"Security Concern with MyFoscam.org\".As for the image quality, the clearest can be acquired at 320x240 (rather small). The only other option is 640x480 which is a bit grainy. Static images are easily recognizable, even at night with the infra-red LEDs lighting the scene. However, motion video at either of these resolutions leaves a lot to be desired. Motion is very blurry and infrequently identifiable. In my experience with these cameras and other multiple Foscam's I bought here (FI8910W and FI8905W), I found this to be the case with video and snapshot stills when motion is in the scene. Basically, if you know who/what it is, then you can probably identify it, but good luck with an unexpected/uninvited guest. I believe this to be an inherent weakness in the camera design and a detriment when using these for home surveillance.Another note on the infra-red LEDs: they emit a red glow in the dark or low-light environments. Therefore, they are not really suited for concealment and can easily be spotted.  They also have other bright power and network activity LEDs on them as well.  While the network LED can be shut off in the software, the power LED cannot. With these on the front they happily announce their presence to any would-be intruder (day or night - which I realize is moot given the aforementioned red-glow).As for the other CMS (Central Management Software) software included with the camera(s), it does work but it is not without its own quirks. -- For one thing, CMS *MUST* be run with *Administrator* privileges in Windows (I use Win7 Pro). Otherwise, it cannot be properly configured for use with the cameras. So, right-mouse-click the icon and select \"Run as administrator\". This is a software design flaw which could have been overcome by incorporating other methods. -- Once configured, I found CMS to be clunky and sluggish when controlling cameras. I had eight of them setup and it was painful to remotely operate them. With two or three configured it was more manageable.

I had ordered some Wanscam Cameras that Pan and Tilt and are also wireless and they are more readily adaptable to the changing environment. I can move them around if the sun causes a glare problem.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "damn good ip cam!", "Author": "Chris Swiontek", "ReviewID": "R1JYIFHOD8NJ2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT! for adding to an existing i.p. cam system {shows up in ip camera tools clean}great rez and frame rate,and the wireless range is pretty impressive {if you actually have a decent router/not belkin or other cheap crap from walmart=)night vision is OK, not the best ive seen {05w foscams have the best}, but good for a 15x15 foot room or office}pretty small {good thing} and the BEST mounting bracket i have EVER seen come with a foscam {i have installed 1000s over the years}perfect \"fixed position\" ip cam, and have good angle view {3.6mm is actually what comes with it/pretty good/and is a 1/2\" lense,witch you can get other mm just about anywhere. {i recomend a 2.1mm for very small rooms /less than 15'x15'}  if youre getting poor frame rates on wireless, you have a \"ghetto router\", spend a few buks and buy a \"real one\".  p.s.

In addition, there are a number of merchants selling genuine Foscam cameras who do not provide adequate support or after-sales service to their customers, or require their customers to ship their genuine Foscam cameras back to China in order to receive a replacement or refund.
