Well, you could, provided you had a tripod and were prepared to fuss around with the settings for each shot. I bought this remote thinking I would be able to bracket more easily without having to even touch the camera. Not so. It only works if you turn your camera's shooting mode dial to \"remote\" .... duh .... but I wanted to use it to trigger \"Continuous Low and High Speed Shutter release.\" You can't have it both ways, according to Nikon. I think you can get a wired remote that will do just about anything, including changing your shutter, aperture and other settings, but they aren't cheap.So basically, it was a waste of money because any $9.00 third party remote would do the exact same thing. Amazon even has their own remote for Nikon DSLR cameras that look and behave the same for half the price.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003U4H8IU"}}
