The viewing window, on a camera this small is almost useless, but even funnier, it was delivered foggy! It is an internal lenses that is dirty so I can't clean it either.  As I don't plan on using it anyway, I didn't return it.  The internal battery doesn't last very long. In video mode, it will last maybe ten minutes.  The external battery would cure this, but it makes the the set up a lot more cumbersome.  Oh, and recently, that external battery unit has failed.  Photos taken with it are grainy, but for it's size, it's ok, I wasn't expecting a 8 megapixel photo.  It's a tiny camera and as a novelty, it's ok.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "the real", "Author": "anas almanee", "ReviewID": "R1BLGH3OQPA4PO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hi,It's really nice CAM  but they said it's about 8 mega pixels.
