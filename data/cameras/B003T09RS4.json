Requires a fair amount of time to learn how to use. At full zoom with the teleconverter attached it requires long arms to focus. Also, you may have to take into account the tripod you use. With my tripod, I have to account for the drop of the camera body. I still like the lens.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great vision", "Author": "malu", "ReviewID": "R3003S16T4OX7U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this lens because I want to become a professional and this just was beyond my expectations. The pic I took from the moon is fantastic. I strongly recommend either the seller as the lens.
