I purchasedthis camera six months ago and it's excellent.  I purchased the black ...not the pink one.  Everything works and the stabilization and Panoramicfeatures are excellent. No problems so far.  Update: 03/08 I started using the video feature and was disappointed, hardly any sound.  My Canon cameras are better for photos and video but cost more $., Power Shot 800 is excellent in every dept.  But, this is an excellent camera...for the price...just not the video sound.  When played back on the camera, I canhardly hear the sound.  When played back on the computer...the sound is fine.", "Date": "February 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Owned this for more than a year", "Author": "D.

I am now looking to purchase another for my sister for a gift because she is so impressed by the quality of pictures it takes.  i am writting a review because i saw the goof ball who gave the camera a1 or 2 stars because of the size and states they returned it within and hour of receiving it. well had they read the specs they would of known the size BEFORE the order. it is not big and bulky.  and they never used it and devleoped any pics so how would they be knowledgable enough to rate it on use.  i love it, it is clear and precise. i get action shots and up close photos are amazing. i am addicted to taking pictures of my dog and up close you can even see each individual whiskers with clarity it is well worth every penny.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great pictures!", "Author": "Ralph H.

Lightweight, easy to use and very pratical, it balances power and versatility with portability and practicality. The price range for this camera was also outstanding. It is so easy to use, a novice can pick it up and take great pictures, yet the controls allow flexability and creativity with little trouble.I never been more pleased with a camera, and this is my 7th camera in 30 years.", "Date": "September 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "very disappointing purchase", "Author": "vanessa", "ReviewID": "R150UY2UG5SJ23", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought this camera and was under the false impression that it was a thin sleek camera and light as well which it is not. Its big and bulky and not worth what i paid for it. I returned it not even an hour after it was delivered, its not practical at all i decided to go with the olympus fe-280 a much better camera and its half its size and half its weight. This camera has good functions and stuff but maybe GE should develop a much smaller camera.", "Date": "December 23, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000TTM82A"}}
