I was only able to take 12 pictures before realizing that I needed a memory card to take more.  Not sure why it didn't come with one.  I also own a Canon camera very much like this one and it takes hundreds of pictures without an additional memory card.  I also wasn't very impressed with the quality of the photos.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0013RT3F2"}}
