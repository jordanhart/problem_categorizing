I got it around the 4th of July, so I've only had this for a few days, but it is amazing! My only two things so far are #1, the little booklet does not really help, except to get you barely started. The manual on the DVD is 120 pages long, so get a chunk of time where you can read it, it takes quite a long time, but it is totally worth it. #2, it doesn't take to good indoor nighttime photos. When I tried out, I thought it would be better at at least that from my previous camera, the Kodak EasyShare C190, but is doesn't. However,it surpasses the C190 in everything else, it's just the nighttime indoor pictures. Outdoor is great. Another thing, I must of overlooked it when researching, the T350 has no internal memory. So if you don't have a memory card when you first by this camera, you will be out of luck. Otherwise it's amazing!  It has a awesome firework mode, I had on on the C190, but it was crappy. This one is awesome! It gets great shots of the fireworks. Another cool thing is you don't have to get a regular black or silver colored camera, there are other cool color options. I love all of the different shooting modes, and the fact you can like make your own video, edit it, and join it to others up to 2 GB is totally amazing. This is a great camera, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants some good photos.UPDATEI've had this for a bit longer now, and one other \"problem\" I had was the position of the flash, not a huge deal, I will be able to adapt to it. It's just in the place where my pointer finger usually is on the camera, so sometimes I'll have a tinted skin-colored photo. That's really my only other problem, but as I said before, it's easily fixed. My old Kodak had it in a different position, so after having it for more than a year,  got used to the position, but that will now change! Still an amazing Camera!UPDATE #2Still amazing camera,I had a problem that when sometimes I'd get a face that looked like it was sunburned... when it really wasn't. The surprise part of that was when I downloaded that photo, the face went back to its natural color. So even though it looked like it was sunburned, I guess it's just the camera LCD or something like that.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "the first  one was defective, the replacement is awesome!", "Author": "John Lindsey", "ReviewID": "RLNNT2PLWLDGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to send this one back. I kept getting a message \"turn camera off and turn camera on again\". This was frustrating since both times were when I was bike riding and the shots I missed were once in a life time ones. I bought the camera because of he good luck I have always had with Fuji products.The replacement arrived in three days and so far I am more that happy with it.It takes superlative videos, the still shots are unbelievable, the camera itself is blue and a work of art.I would recommend this camera to everyone.July 31, 2012We just got back from a Florida vacation and I am very happy with this camera and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.I took some very nice beach videos at Little Talbot Island State Park and all I can say is that it is a beautiful product.I love this camera and I am very glad I bought it.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "O.K. camera,  but can't handle indoor shots", "Author": "spitfireforbas", "ReviewID": "R29KSBJQ97VE3L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this as a gift for my wife who wanted a simple point and click camera.  Outdoor pictures quality is OK, but indoor is another story.  Using the auto mode, I can take 3 pictures of the same object with the same conditions at the same time and get three completly different results.1. A very dark photo.2. a photo with an amber hue3. A slightly lighter picture.Camera can not make the correct decision on the best flash.  Also, I'm constatly getting a message of it much movement when taking a picture.  Even if its on a tripod.  Not as simple as we were hoping", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good quality, some usability issues, poor battery performane", "Author": "Itai", "ReviewID": "R3NURR3Y7YVCLC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this product about a month a go and already took about 600 photos with it. Here are my conclusions so far:1. Photo quality it very good2. Camera modes are helping to improve quality but switching modes is cumbersome3. Battery performance is bad. It runs empty after about 150 photos (with mixture use of flash) and won't hold a full day long if you take a lot of photos. Consider purchase additional battery (That is what I'm planning to do)4. Point for your consideration: I didn't even try taking videos with this battery though I don't believe it is going to hold it. Looks more like a gimmick and not a 'real' featureoverall, good photo quality with some usability draw backs and one big disadvantagehave fun,Itai", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the camera", "Author": "Lea", "ReviewID": "R2CN9SUZFKHT1C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera works wonderfully.

It's not a very good camera. The quality of the photos in similar settings to photos taken with the previous FinePix are significantly poorer. It has difficulty focusing and many of the photos are blurry. It doesn't seem to know what to do in indoor settings when it's on Auto or SR. It doesn't seem possible to have quick access to the flash settings unless you have the sound on. The colors are washed out and the photos that somehow end up in focus need a lot of work in photoshop.The photos remind me a lot of the photos my 110 camera took, back in the 70s. I have an iphone 3 that takes better photos.I strongly recommend that no one buy this camera.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix T350 Digital Camera (Black)", "Author": "B.

Our old camera came out perfect like always. We purchased the T350 because of the wide vewer and longer telaphoto lens which was to update our old one.  After printing pictures from both cameras our old camera is much clearer and not distorted in any way.  The old camera has two double AA batteries which last for weeks.The new T350 diden't even last the evening.  So I am wondering because the battery was loosing power if that was the reason my pictures came out so poorly or because it was inside a building or both.  Now I plugged in the charger so I could print out my pictures and it did not even stay charged long enough to print out the pictures and had no problem with the old one.  I went over the manual very good to make sure the camera was fully charged before using it.  Now am I doing something wrong or is it the camera?  This was a gift for my wife to replace the A350 a she was thrilled about receiving it.  Not so much now.  Is there a longer life battery or do we have to carry an extra around with us?", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Susan", "ReviewID": "R3K0ELBT9ZBV48", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to take to Disney World with me because my old camera wasn't working.  I only had a day to become familiar with the camera and am still learning, but it was easy to learn the basics using the menu.  I had a few mishaps with focus all due to my inexperiece with the camera but most of my shots were great.  I especially enjoyed the panoramic feature.  Sunset on the beach was fun.  Also played with the panoramic having one person run into each shot so they appear 3 times.  I due miss my view finder, but the screen was bright and large enough.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "KENNY R JENKINS", "ReviewID": "R18DMO7Z0NDVKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "working very fine!  good pic's and the video is good.

Actually bought it after I got tickets to the Lady Gaga concert in Atlanta, due to the high ratings for night shots at concerts. A real bummer that Lady Gaga hurt her back and the concert in March 2013 was canceled. So didn't get to try it out for what I specifically bought it for, however have been using it to take photos on my motorcycle rides in North Georgia and various hikes in the mountains. It takes perfectly clear pictures, many settings, good autofocus and has a nice zoom.

Mine wouldn't take a charge, though I tried several times. The camera would indicate that it was fully charged--but when I turned it on, would either fail immediately and turn itself off or give me a low-battery warning. I could not determine if it was the charger, the battery, or the camera itself, so was forced to return it for refund. Replacement batteries of this type are very pricey, so it wasn't worth trying a different battery.Unfortunately there is no option here for rating a product that you weren't able to use, so I had to give it one star.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!", "Author": "RYAN FOTI", "ReviewID": "R222FYJ4WLOUW7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Wow, how anyone could have anything good to say about this thing is amazing to me! Pictures were dark and grainy no matter what setting we had it on. Toyed with it in every kind of lighting and scene scenario and it is easily the worst camera I've ever owned.
