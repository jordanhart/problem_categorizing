Uses 3 AAA batteries for power and its a miser on the energy so the rechargeable batteries last longer.  Takes great pictures as long as you have ample light.  Small and slim fits easily into the pockets.  If you buy this camera I suggest a piece of packing tape across the display screen to prevent scratches on the glass.  One drawback is the flash sensor, it seems to be inadequate in the dark, works well if there is some light, however the picture looks dark.  With practice that can be overcome.", "Date": "July 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Absolutely hideous & useless", "Author": "M. Dalrymple", "ReviewID": "R1ZALUGIA8PRXC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is literally the worst camera I've ever encountered.  My friend bought a super-cheap keychain camera for her young daughter, and THAT took better pictures.  The color is horrible -- no depth whatsoever.  The flash is extremely eager -- I took pictures of a green blanket on a black background under a light ( a situation that worked wonderfully with my FujiFilm), and it looked as if the camera just cut out the object entirely and left a pure white shape where the blanket was.  Pictures without the flash are completely dark.  But the kicker is that when you push the button to take the picture, a screen comes up to say \"Photo taking.  Hold camera still\" and then it's a good 6-8 seconds before it actually TAKES the picture.  And the buttons are plastic painted to look like metal.Frankly, I can't believe any company could produce something so bad.", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Terrible flash, poor images, errors in manual, poor tech support", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Lead author of Conquering In...", "ReviewID": "R3OO9SGW6W1X5L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very poor interface, very limited control over images. When you take a picture, you have to hold the camera still for over 2 seconds as the screen goes black and tells you to wait - but you don't know when the photo gets taken or what exactly you're photographing. Very hard to capture a moment, very likely to result in blurring and low quality.Worst of all is the flash. The camera overexposes terribly when flash is used. I don't think the flash is too bright, but the camera seems to not adjust its exposure time to compensate for the presence of flash. I called tech support a couple times to address this issue. First they said they were too busy and would call me back within 24 hours. Almost 36 hours later, no one had called back. Then I tried again and finally reached someone. They told me that the camera just needed to be reset to the factory default. To do this, just take the batteries out and wait 30 minutes (i.e., go away and try calling us again later).  He assured me that \"everything will be alright\" if I do that. I didn't believe it because we had that problem right out of the box with factory settings - and there are so few settings that it's hard to imagine what could be incorrectly set. So I asked to speak to a supervisor. When I reached the supervisor, he asked what kind of memory card I had in the camera. When I said it was a 1 GB card, he said that was the problem. The camera can only take SD cards up to 512 MB. Again, I was incredulous. First, how could that cause the problem? He said the bigger card put too much stress on the camera and made it unable to process the image properly. That sounds crazy. And second, I pointed out that their own printed materials state that it can take a 1 GB card, and pointed specifically to page 3 in the user manual, for example. Oh yes, they are aware of that typo and are working to fix it. Really?? So he said that all I needed to was run off to the store and buy another card with 512 mB or less and all would be rosy. I also asked why the first tech support guy gave me a different story. \"Oh, he didn't know you had a 1 GB card.\" Right. Well, I borrowed a 256 MB SD card and found out, as I expected, that it made no difference. The camera grotesquely overexposes with flash regardless with 256 mB cards as well as 1 GB cards. And now that it has been over 30 minutes with the batteries out, I've also tested the initial \"cure\" and found, naturally, that resetting the camera doesn't solve its overexposure problem.Even without flash, image quality is poor. Stick with your cheap cell phone camera or buy a real camera. This one doesn't even provide the basic functionality that you expect in a cheapy like this. And their tech support, if you can reach them, won't be of any help. Stay away.Cheap doesn't have to mean ridiculously poor.On the plus side, it is small enough to fit into a pocket. For best results, keep it there.", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "It's adequate.", "Author": "Kimberly A.

James", "ReviewID": "R3RT0YH183D0UN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a Christmas gift and I was very grateful. I have a toddler and want to take tons of pictures of her constantly! Well, I have about 2 \"clear\" pictures out of about 2 million I've taken. This camera turns black and says to hold the camera still while it takes the picture... for like 30 seconds! My daughter always moves WAY before the picture is taken. Even when I do get some sort of picture of her when she is standing completely still (however, not in the pose I wanted by then, or even smiling, etc) it is extremely blurry!The flash is pointless and this camera doesn't work in low light, so you have to be in complete sun light or an extremely bright room to get any kind of a picture at all. If you try to use the flash, in pitch black, low light or ANY light room, the picture is completely white. No images. No glimpse of what you wanted to take a picture of. Just completely white.Battery life isn't THAT bad, but there's no point in using this camera at all. Unless maybe you give it to a child who's just taking pictures of random things for fun but even then the camera isn't durable enough for rough play.My camera won't even work anymore now. I turn it on and the screen is all blurry static lines and it says \"sensor error.\" I am going to buy a better camera now. A \"REAL\" one, like samsung or canon or something. It may cost twice as much as this one, but I don't care!!! The frustration with this camera, let alone the awful pictures, just isn't worth it!!!!", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Is there a rating less than 1 star?", "Author": "Corey Scott", "ReviewID": "R182KE1YXF9V76", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was the worst investment I ever made in my life, even at the $50 price I paid for it.  You're better off drawing a picture on a piece of paper every time you want to record a memory.I bought it as a last minute purchase for a trip to Hawaii with my girlfriend, because my old Sony camera was just too bulky to keep in my pocket while traveling.  I made the huge mistake of leaving my Sony camera at home, because that was the point of buying this new camera.  Thank God my girlfriend brought her Kodak EasyShare with her, or else we'd have nothing but disposable camera prints of our memories.Pros: It weighs just enough to keep a stack of papers weighed down in mild breezes.  It may also be a suitable weapon to throw at someone's head.Cons: It takes at least 5 seconds to record a picture, and you never have any clue at which point during those 5 seconds it is actually recording the image, so you have to keep the camera absolutely still for all 5 seconds or you end up with a smeared photo.  The crazy thing is, even if you set it to a really fast exposure setting to eliminate blur, the camera still smears the image as if it was printed on a sheet of rubber and stretched apart in weird directions.  It can't take a photo if the sun is in in the view, because apparently the sun is too bright and shows up as a black circle on the photo.  The resolution is TERRIBLE.  I think it uses like a 0.5MP sensor, and then uses software to stretch the image to 5.1MP.  For example, I saw a funny street sign that I wanted to take a picture of, and standing 10 feet from it and shooting at least 10 tries, I couldn't take a single picture of it that was legible, and I finally just gave up.  When I got home, I put the camera in a drawer, figuring I'd never use it again even though I couldn't return it.  About a month later, our dog was doing something funny, so I grabbed the camera to take a picture, and wouldn't you know it, it had stopped working.  Even new batteries couldn't revive it.I would feel ripped off if I paid $5 for this camera.  It doesn't even deserve the energy it takes to place it in a garbage can.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "horrible camera", "Author": "Terra A.

My husband and I have both tried to make it work better figuring user error on the part of our 15 yr old.... but alas no... the camera is just worthless. The lighting is never right. It is too bright so the pic is faded out or too dark so you can hardly see what you took a picture of. I often end up getting out my cell phone camera and taking a better pic and sending to an online place for printing with better results. It takes forever to take the pic so you sit there trying to hold the camera still enough with the pic often being blurry.

I got them for way less than this and was expecting the worst. I was, instead, pleasantly surprised. The silver looking buttons are all metal and not plastic. The plastic that people may be referring to is the dial to switch camera settings. The camera takes really decent if not, nice pictures. I tried one out in the sun and the photos came out great. Almost as nice as my Kodak camera. Since they looked so great, I decided to keep the other 2 and give them to my daughters to use on our vacations and when they go on fieldtrips to school. Honestly, the camera takes nice photos. My daughter used it to talk photos at the Aerosmith concert and her's came out, mine did not using my Kodak camera. You can add flash, timer, whatever. It even allows you to choose between megapixel settings. It also shoots movies. The fact that you can put in your own SD card makes it even better. It is not much larger than a cell phone and fits in my purse to use for everyday surprise moments I want to capture. I even take this one to the beach!
