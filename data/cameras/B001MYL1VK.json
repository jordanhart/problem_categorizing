They fail frequently and are brutally expensive to buy OEM replacement parts for. I was able to follow some awesome step by step instructions on the chevymalibuforum website to install two of these in the rear doors of a 2008 Saturn Aura. I was able to install both of them in about 3 hours and they seem to be working great. Fixed both doors for less than $25. OEM parts are over $200 each!", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "93 del sol with crappy aftermarket actuators.", "Author": "Jaspreet S Mushiana", "ReviewID": "R2QCHRB2FBCDSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "having a car that never came with power door locks(93 sols didnt.) the previous owners installed some very cheap ones that began to fail and cause non stop issues with the locking ang unlocking of my vehicle. after installing these in place of the horrid ones they had installed, all my issues where solved. yeah they are a little loud, but if thats honestly a concern to you while looking at AFTERMARKET actuators, you might want to look into paying 4x as much for \"OEM\" ones.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Strong", "Author": "V.

I purchased it to replace a replacement door lock that went bad. The original actuator crapped out, I installed a new (crap) one which died less than a year later. I got this Install Essentials actuator, (at a cheaper price than the one it replaced) and it's even quieter than the one that went bad. I would buy another one to hold onto in case the driver door actuator goes out.

In order to make the keyless entry work I needed one of these installed in the driver's door. The installation was super easy thanks to the included accessories.

This kit includes a bit of wire tubing, wiring and connectors, adjustable rod, mounting bracket, and additional hardware. Since I am trying to add a trunk-unlock actuator to a car that doesn't have one, this setup is perfect because it will allow me to improvise a bit around how to hook it up. I quickly hooked the actuator up to a 12v battery and it looks like it will do the job just fine.

If you are doing a new install, you want this one.  It came in a box with all the mounting screws, rod, bar, rubber boots & wire that you will not get with the cheaper knock offs.  If you're just doing a replacement like me I would still recommend this one.  The reason is this actuator weighs more than the knock offs & better made.  Yes the others may be cheaper, but I question the reliability.  Also, the savings are not worth my time if I am replacing it sooner than later.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Powerful Actuator", "Author": "R. Leon \"Mr. Engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R8FV25XN0QI6S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing some research this model was chosen due to its reputation of providing more power to the latches than other available models. Also, this model comes with everything shown in the picture.The 524T was installed as a replacement actuator for a previously installed but different model. This model and the other model had almost the exact same body and dimensionally they were the same. Therefore the existing holes worked perfectly. After installing the new unit I was thrilled at how well it performed. Honestly, the old actuator was never as powerful as this one.This actuator is a little more expensive than other models out there, but if you are going to tear your vehicle apart to add power door locks spend the extra money and do it right the first time.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to install and works great", "Author": "Rich Holm", "ReviewID": "R1TN8Z5L4H1Y9R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Added this to my 1999 honda Civic when I installed my Viper alarm.
