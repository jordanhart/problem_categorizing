It comes with a battery, camera case and a roll of film. The camera is very small and compact which is great for traveling. The picture quality is excellent as we just took it on a trip to the ocean and the pictures turned out excellent. I was a little worried after reading reviews of other cameras that claim to 'blur' the pictures taken with the zoom fully extended. That is not the case with this camera, all pictures were crystal clear and no blur present in any fully extended pictures. There is another review on this camera on this site, that is not the 'kit' version as this one is. The reviewer claims there is a problem with the view finder blocking the view, I found that there is a tiny portion of the view finder that you can see a fraction of the lens when it is fully retracted. After you move the lens out at all it is totally gone. Also, when it is all the way in, it is barely noticable and I wouldn't have even noticed if it wasn't in his review. I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "September 13, 2004"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00022F588"}}
