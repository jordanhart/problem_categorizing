It is an excellent little camera and very user friendly! The included software is very useful and not just a pile of crap that usually comes with stuff like this. If you have XP, the software is not necessary because it does everything for you, the software just has a bunch of fun extras. The display screen is not very large but this doesn't seem to be a big problem for me since I just wanted a point and shoot camera. It does take some time in between pictures using flash, however, outdoors i never use the flash and it works great! One photo after the other. Doesn't take forever to load the photos onto your PC either! very simple! Would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a compact camera and not a lot of bells and whistles! wonderful product! PS... don't be intimidated if you don't recognize the brand name, I was worried myself, but you have no reason to worry!----i would like to retract this statement. This camera has proven to be AWFUL. After just 3 weeks with this camera, i've decided it's terrible. Poor photo quality, time between photos increases as the camera ages and there are so many better ones out there. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. it's awful!", "Date": "October 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "Okay for the price if you read the manual first", "Author": "V. Lee", "ReviewID": "R2QHFI95M3LVZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Considering the dirt-cheap price, this is an okay vacation or backup camera, especially considering that the whole thing is a lot less than an underwater housing alone for any other camera.At first, I was pretty disturbed by the fuzzy shots I was taking, until I played around with the camera and its settings a bit and READ THE MANUAL.The first thing to realize is that the camera appears to be fixed-focus.  Anything you take in normal mode has to be at least 4 feet away or it will be fuzzy.  If the thing you're pointing at appears fuzzy but the background is not, it's not because the camera is focusing on the wrong thing; it's because you're pointing at something too close.  If you back off a bit and use a little digital zoom instead, the final picture will be better.As mentioned by some others, this camera also has a pretty slow exposure time, especially indoors.  The problem is that it has a sensitivity of only IS0 100, but its automatic flash does not come on except in very low light and there is no way to force the flash on.  It puts up a \"hand\" icon if it is too dark to take a freehand shot and you need to steady the camera on a tripod or by leaning against something.  Pay attention to the icon, because if you ignore this, you will get a fuzzy shot every time.It's a shame the makers of the camera didn't design the flash to properly come on whenever it's too dark for a handheld shot.  If they had that, it would take much better indoor pictures and I'd give this camera a 4-star rating.  As now, I'm still glad I bought it, as now I have a camera I can take to beach, camping, etc without having to worry about it.", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best Camera for the price!", "Author": "JLH", "ReviewID": "R1IWF40Y39JAHZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's light, it's inexpensive, it's small - AND takes GREAT pics!

Picture quality is good, the resolution is great, and it's extremely easy to transfer the pictures to your computer -- just plug in the USB connector and it'll show up as a removeable hard drive that you can copy the pictures from.  It only holds about 20 pictures at full resolution, but about twice as many at the medium resolution (which is still pretty descent).  If I had bought a Polaroid instead, I would have spent $80 so far just on the film he would have taken.  Plus, with the video cable, you can plug it right into your TV, which my son did at the end of his birthday party, so everybody could enjoy seeing all the pictures he took all day long.

Donaldson \"Cal-diver\"", "ReviewID": "RQ17RZUM1DP7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My expectations were a bit low after reading reviews on this little camera. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived yesterday and I got a chance to check it out. You have to realize you get a nice underwater housing AND a 3MP camera for $106 shipped in 3-5 days. This camera actually takes pretty good photos for its price. I was looking for something to replace the throw-away underwater cameras we've used so often... that always produce disappointing photos. The quality of the photos off the 308U are much better and I'm happy with them.This camera has an amazing set of features for the price. A nice LCD display, continuous digital zoom out to 4x, date stamp on the picture if you want it, auto or selected light balance, choices of resolution (don't use the highest interpolated 6.6MP level), 12fps video with playback. How did they cram so much into this little thing for such a small price?The case is good quality. Although I haven't tested it underwater yet but I expect it will perform to 15' as advertized.On the down side the shutter lag is very long, perhaps 2 seconds or longer. Taking photos of moving subjects, like fish, is going to be a challenge. Its easy to get blurred photos due to the shutter lag. It is easy to push the shutter button and not keep the camera steady until the photo is actually captured 2-3 seconds later. If you just hold still until the photo is captured it works fine. The flash has only one brightness level so if you take a flash photo of something less than about 4' away the whole picture will be mostly white. However if you flash a subject 10' feet away it works well.I stuck a 128M SD card into it and was able to fit 206 photos on the card using the second highest (3MP) level. I took all those photos, about 20 more with flash, and a couple of 10 second videos, all on the included AA batteries and only used about 1/3 of the battery power. A couple of high power NiMh rechargables should get 300 or more photos on a set of batteries.Mind you these photos are not going to win you any photo contests but as a point and shoot, with an underwater housing, LCD screen, flash, and video (no sound), this camera more than meets my needs for the intended purpose. This would not be my only camera if I only could have one. But for boating, and snorkeling it will allow me to leave my much more expensive camera at home.UPDATE: Sadly I just couldn't get this camera to produce reasonable photos. After a great start it let me down. I have returned it to Amazon and now use disposable cameras which aren't too great either but better than this little disappointment.", "Date": "October 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "save your time and money", "Author": "M.

Sutherland", "ReviewID": "R2RYR9RY8M0NJJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera with the \"U\" designation is really the only thing that makes this camera worth it.  Otherwise it would be a substandard 3 megapixel camera with fair optics, slow startup and picture-taking response time, hard to handle, battery-eating import.  With the 'U' it comes with a waterproof enclosure that works down to around 15 feet (i've had mine in a foot and seemed ok).If you're looking for daytime outdoor watersport photos, it'll do, and for around $100 and some change, it's worth it.  Don't use the flash with the underwater housing or you'll get a glare in the same spot in every picture.  I bought this for times when i couldn't take my good camera out (rain, kayaking etc).  And for this, it's a decent camera.  It doesn't deliver 3MP, more like a 1.2, even though the literature says it's software delivers 6MP interpolated.  Yah, right.  But if you're after internet shots or 4x6 final prints, you should be happy, with one caveat:  It requires a steady hand in anything but day-bright light.  It seems to take the picture about the time you release (not depress) the button, so be aware that it's so slow that you may have moved on to the next shot, but the camera's still working.  To take a shot, depress the button halfway, tell everyone to say cheese, depress the button fully and then slowly remove your finger.  By the time you hear the 2nd beep, you should've gotten a good shot.  After this it still takes 6 - 7 seconds processing time so don't expect to snag the action shots!Also, buy an SD card as it only has a little bit of memory internally and you're gonna go thru batteries (but only uses 2 AA), so get a charger too.", "Date": "September 18, 2004"}, {"Title": "Not worth the trouble", "Author": "Carrie", "ReviewID": "R2QFQEITCFB58D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Nice little camera, but it does not take quality pictures.

I have a specific purpose in mind for this camera, and I think it going to be just fine for that purpose. For the money I think it is a fine sports, waterfront camera. I did find that it was dificult to get the focus right in macro mode. You have a very short depth of field,(about two inches), so keep within that range. I did get some nice pictures of a bee though, (and most cameras in this price range don't have a macro at all).

The 308 honestly is acting like it has an ISO of 25 and is something from the 1980's.I rate this camera two only because the underwater housing actually works, but I can't see what use it would be expect in a shallow pool in Arizona on a tripod.

If any of your subjects move, you see a big blur7. There just is not much functionality - basic things like timed shots don't exist on this camera, so forget about being self photographs8.
