I also thought it was a pretty good deal because of some of the extra goodies, like the mini tripod and cleaning kit that I didn't receive.I know that the holiday rush is on, but you guys really screwed up on this one!  I'm sending the wrong size lenses back, hopefully for a full refund.  I thought I was buying a complete kit but what I got was a couple of lenses that are the wrong size and an adapter.  There's a new Amazon distribution center that was just built in Schertz, TX, not far from where I live so I think that I'll try to return what I did receive to them in person!", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EA69XQ2"}}
