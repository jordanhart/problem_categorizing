{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Move over, Leica", "Author": "Sky Blue", "ReviewID": "R1U7H3UI5RDDNH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a fan of Leica M7 with 50 mm Summilux for a decade.  I have used a few digital cameras but nothing could replace my M7.  My biggest discontent with digital cameras have been white balance and contrast -- no matter which camera I tried, I could never quite get the same perfect white balance and the natural and yet strong and beautiful contrast of film camera photography, especially those of M7 with Summilux.  Digital photos almost always had the washed-out colors and weired color bias. I hesitated to invest in M9 because I did not believe, for right or wrong, it could quite deliver what M7 had delivered.  Leica had never been known to be a pioneer in digital photography.  I also tried the first digital Leica called Digilux some 9 years ago, which was a joke. Convenience means little if the quality is lacking; I would rather have 10 photos that I like than 100 photos that I do not like. So despite the efforts and costs of processing needed for a film camera, I kept on using my Leica M7.Enter Fuji X-e1.  After taking some photos, I blew them on my 60-inch PDP.  Perfect.  Perfect at ISO 4000.  And what a contrast.  Wow.  As far as I know, this is as close to a film photo feel as a digital photo could get: white balance is impeccable, skin tones perfect, strong contrast, colors that sing, and no grains at ISO 4000!  Hallelujah.Another thing about this camera: JPG files are excellent.  I hate keeping RAW files.  They are big files taking up so much space and post processing is such a pain to me.  With this camera, you can simply forget about shooting in RAW.  JPGs are just as nice.  Even after reducing the file size to a mere 40 KB for emailing purposes, your photo retains the color and beauty.The EVF is awesome.  OLED screen is so bright and beautiful that you may never want to go back to the LCD on the back to focus, although there is some lag in dark because of low refresh rate.  The lag would matter more in manual focus but also in auto focus, because you cannot capture the moment properly. Auto sensor option will turn off the LCD if the EVF senses your eye is nearby, and vice versa saving the battery.  This camera is also packed with nice features that you actually use such as horizontal line indicator on the EVF -- it tells you whether your composition is perfectly horizontal.  Another useful feature is something called \"color-mode bracketing\" along with the usual other bracketing options.  First, you can use a few very nice color modes with this camera, and, second, with a single click, you can produce multiple photos captured in different color modes.  My favorite is the Velvia mode -- for those who remember the ISO 50 film with thick colors to be used with a projector, yes, this resembles its colors quite a bit.  Mind you, they are not for some special effects -- they are still passable as \"regular\" photos because the difference is well within the boundaries of mainstream photos and the skin tones do not appear weird even in this mode; they are just a bit more vibrant and strong, that's all.There is much to like about digital photography in general but also much to dislike.  I like its compact size, convenience, ability to transfer files and view across different media, immediacy in viewing the result and ease of use.  But I dislike the lens barrel that comes out with noise each time you turn it on.  I dislike the menu buttons with labyrinthine structures.  I dislike the touch buttons.  Most of all, I don't like the color renditions and tricky white balance.  This Fuji X-e1 has cured all or at least most such woes, while retaining the traditional forte of digital cameras and keeping its size well below that of a DSLR.  Bravo.  Now I am afraid my M7 may end up being a thing of the past, finally, although I will never part with it.  A Leica is a Leica after all, but perhaps I will never buy a M9 as I feel I have found a worthy substitute at a fraction of the price.As for me, I considered this one among the following contenders: Sony RX1 and RX100. I crossed out Lumix lines because somehow I could never be satisfied with its white balance.  RX100 is very nice for its price and I consider it an ultimate P&S;, but I do not like the lens barrel that comes out each time I turn it on. Also its sensor size is a bit too small for my liking. However, it is a great little camera to get and I may well get it someday for its extreme portability and HD video capability alone.  As for RX1,  although I love its full-frame sensor, having a fixed, not-that-fast (2.0), non-changeable 35 mm lens is the deal killer for me, along with having no internal EVF or OVF. For that kind of price, Sony should really have done better.  If you are considering RX100, RX1 or even NEX 7, do yourself a favor and make sure you test X-e1 before making up your mind. Just demoing it through the LCD at the back of the camera is not enough. If your dealer allows it, bring your own SD card, take shots on it with all the aforementioned cameras, blow the pictures on your own computer at home while paying particular attention to the color qualities.[UPDATE] As for the lens, so far I have only used the kit lens (18-55mm). I have not used manual focusing yet, so I cannot comment on it. This lens is quite light-weight and simply superb. Auto-focus is not the fastest but fast enough and accurate. You can make a shallow depth of field at 2.8 and the resulting bokeh is quite nice.  This may not be the fastest lens (ie lowest F stop is 2.8) but certainly fast enough and since you can make perfect photos at ISO 4000, I think this lens is a lot more useful than the well-rated 35 mm 1.4, which I have never used but may buy some day.[UPDATE 2] The flash did not work. Since it was the first time I tried, I guess it did not work from the beginning.  I was thinking of returning the unit, but when I called Fuji service center, the person suggested me to \"RESET\" the unit from the menu button. I did, and it worked. I asked him if this was a well-known issue, and the person told that it was and Fuji was working on it.  I asked again if this was something I have to do from time to time (ie resetting), and the person told me that so far it seemed to work fine with the first reset but they were not sure.  So if you buy a unit, make sure you test the flash.  If it does not work, reset the unit.  Fuji is working on the fix.  I was thinking of reducing a star from my rating, but since it is working fine for now after reset, I am leaving as is.  But if Fuji does not come with a permanent fix or if this happens again, I will reduce a star.[UPDATE 3] I found out why the flash did not work.  It had nothing to do with bugs or defects.  Manner mode was on and that was why.  When the manner mode is on, not only all sounds are muted but also flash and focus light are all disabled.  Perfect for taking photos at classical concerts.  (If you just want the sound off without disabling the flash or light, there is a sound option menu as well including complete off.) That explains why it worked when I reset the camera -- the manner mode is turned off at reset.  Funny, even the experienced Fuji service man did not know this -- he told me they were \"working on it.\"  It shows this is such a new model -- so new that even the front field folks have not figured out all about it, I guess.[UPDATE 4] Manual focusing a moving object through EVF in low light even when magnified is tricky.  It does not give you a focus confirmation.  I comparison-tested manual and auto, and there was always a discrepancy which makes me not to trust my eyes. Also the kit-lens' manual focusing feel is not superb, although certainly much better than that of X100.  So I think this should be mostly used as an auto-focus camera when you use the kit lens.  Make sure you push the \"enlarge\" button to help focus manually -- a big difference.  By the way, you can always push AE-L/AF-L button to bring the object into immediate auto focus even when the camera is in manual focus mode, which I find very useful. You can also set this button's function AE fix only or AF fix only or both AE fix and AF fix in the menu settings.[UPDATE 5] I think one firmware upgrade feature this camera desperately needs is Minimum Shutter Speed setting. Without this, Auto ISO is only half effective, along with aperture priority mode.  Currently when set at auto-ISO and in the aperture priority mode, this camera is giving me a shutter speed close to the focal length, which, in the case of the kit lens, is 30 mm and hence 1/30th.  This is obviously no good when shooting a moving object, which makes me adjust the ISO value up manually, rendering the auto-ISO not that useful.  Fuji, please update and implement this firmware feature in a near future.  Otherwise, people would simply have to shoot in speed priority mode mostly.[UPDATE 6] I ordered Fuji M-mount adapter to use the body with my 50 mm Summilux. Now there are a few cheaper choices you have such as Kipon but the reason I ordered an official Fuji was because I read that it is the only one that shows all the information as Fuji lenses do.  There are three things you need to be aware of. First, certain Leica lenses do not work with this adapter so you need to read about which ones work and which ones do not.  Second, it does not show the F-stop information anywhere on the viewfinder (even though it takes photos with the F-stop you set on the lens) -- it shows \"F0 (zero)\" all the time. Less of a problem in the aperture priority mode since you know it anyway (since you are setting the aperture), but in the speed priority mode, there is no way of knowing the aperture. Third, the results are OK but certainly not any better than the kit lens. There is no Leica magic -- well-focused pictures look almost identical to those produced by the kit lens.  So two conclusions: (i) I am not so sure about the advantage of buying a much more expensive official Fuji adapter; and (ii) your chief reason for buying the adapter must be to expand your photographic options and not to improve IQ.  IQ will be largely the same even with the supposedly superior and certainly more expensive Leica glass.[Update 7] I ordered Kipon adapter for Contax G2 lenses.  For those who are not familiar, Contax long ago sold a film rangefinder called G2 with three Carl Zeiss lenses in the bundle: Biogon 2.8/28mm, Planar 2/45mm, Sonnar 2.8/90mm.  Those lenses were beautifully crafted, sharp as a tack, and represented supreme value then (you may still find them at eBay).  I once used and loved this Contax G2 extensively along with my Leica M7, but it has been sleeping in my closet in recent years. To get to the point, those Carl Zeiss lenses worked like charm on the X-e1 body.  Sharp, sharp all they way.  Particularly amazing was 90mm Sonnar's portrait performance under low light (with the crop factor of this body, it becomes a 135mm mild zoom).  Wow!  I could see my son's peach fuzz on face in a shot taken from quite some distance.  On the X-e1 body (I cannot stress this qualification enough), I actually prefer Carl Zeiss glasses to the Leica glass.  It is a match made in heaven, and you owe it to yourself to get an adapter to try those lenses if you happen to have them like me. I never thought I would be resurrecting those almost antique lenses from the film era in this digital age, not out of curiosity but for real field usage! One caveat:  the Biogon 2.8/28mm could not be attached to this camera with the Kipon adapter -- it could not be locked and would not focus.  I am not sure if there is any adapter you could use for Biogon 2.8/28mm available in the market.[Update 8] I tried a \"duel\" among the three lenses again: Summilux 50/1.4, Sonnar 90/2.8, and the Fujinon Kit. I shot my bookshelf full of books on a tripod position (around 50 shots each) and tried to see differences. Because of the differences in magnification, Sonnar actually shot from a further distance. Again, the differences were minor but there was a clear winner to my eyes: Sonnar. Color renditions were very similar. But the Summilux 50/1.4 ASPH, although sharp in the center at every aperture, was softer and blurrier on the sides at the same F stop with Sonnar. Sonnar was tack sharp around all edges. I did not notice this when I mounted Summilux on my M7 body. That is why I said I do not particularly prefer Summilux at least on X-e1 body. Fujinon was not as sharp as Sonnar, but entirely acceptable and consistently good.But since the results were so similar, I urge people to buy different lenses only to obtain different F stops or angles and not to obtain better IQ. I see it this way: if you already have a Summilux, you may want to buy a cheap adapter ring, but if you do not have one, forget it. At over $4,000, it is not worth the price at least on this body.It is great to hear Zeiss is coming out with auto-focus for X-mount (see the comment by Midnight Coyote below), but I fear the price! Manual focusing with Sonnar is actually quite fun, and there is one great advantage with manual focusing: once focused, you can shoot subsequent shots actually faster than an auto-focus and this is a great advantage in extreme low-light conditions in which the auto-focus hesitates and struggles for each shot.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!!! So why 3 stars?", "Author": "Chris R. Field \"christoph281\"", "ReviewID": "R3T56VMYWBXZHM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off, I LOVE this camera!!!!!!!!!So why 3 stars? because I cannot recommend it to most people. I HIGHLY recommend this to experienced photographers. However the look, the feel, the incredible high ISO performance, all top notch. The focus is just sad compared to other cameras. If you want to buy this for sports, weddings, wildlife or chasing kids around(which is a bad decision due to the lack of telephoto lenses) you will be very disappointed. If you take a slow and deliberate approach to your photography you will be greatly rewarded.  This is a camera you work with, not a camera you use, and I really like that aspect personally.  But the slow AF, weak AF in low light, and lack of features other cameras have in spades keep it from being a 5 or even a 4. If I were to rate it off the sensor and feel only it would be a 10 out of 5. Optically it is as close to perfect as you will get for less than $3000, and the kit lens is no slouch.If anyone is looking at this they are also probably looking at the Olympus OMD. I own both of these cameras and want to put up a side by side comparison from my own experience.Why compare this against the OMD? Because it has set a new benchmark of performance in the world of mirrorless cameras, and even with a smaller sensor it competes well against larger mid range DSLR's. Other options include the NEX 7 and maybe the NEX-6. I have owned and used both the NEX c3 and NEX 5N quite a bit and they are awesome fast high performance compact point and shoot cameras, you sort of have to just trust them, and they do an excellent job but i am a bit of a control freak with my cameras. I found the manual controls lacking, especially compared to the Olympus OMD and Fuji XE-1. That is not meant to be a knock against the NEX line, i would have included the NEX-7 in this had i any experience with it, nor do i have any experience with the GH3.my experience with DSLR's includes the Nikon D40, D70, D90, D7000, and the Canon 60D and 7D all of which I have used extensively with pro grade lenses such as the Nikon 24-70f/2.8, 70-200f/2.8, and equivalents on the Canons. I am not a pro, just a hard core enthusiast/amateur and timelapse photographer with horrible spelling, and a decent job to fund the hobby.I hope this helps.1) AutofocusOMD's AF blazingly fast for single AF. It focuses in low light areas without the need of the focus lamp, very little hunting. The Continuous AF is not on par with the D7000. It is loaded with various features such as facial tracking, left and right eye priority, touch to focus and shoot, etc. I use the facial tracking when doing things like instructional videos on timelapse.XE-1's AF system is best not tested after using the OMD, because compared to the OMD it is laughable. It hunts in low light even with the AF lamp. It seems to work well enough with some decent light around. The options on Fuji's AF system is Single, Continuous, and Manual. There is no tracking, no facial recognition, you can set the size of the AF point, that is about it. For photographers with a bit of experience this AF system is not going to be much of a hindrance. There is also the Manual focus bar on the display which is AWESOME. See more on that later.2) CustomizationThe OMD is highly customizable, everything from the viewfinder, display, lens function, f1, f2, the list goes on. It is the most customizable camera I have ever had. Almost to the point of making things a bit confusing. It took a while but I now have it set to how I like it, and it is pretty easy to use. You can have the OLED and EFV display different things as well, in fact, borrowing somebody elses OMD for a shoot will probably leave you annoyed and frustrated because they probably set it up a lot differently and it wont even feel like the same camera.The Fuji XE1 is nowhere near as customizable. It has ONE function button, but you cannot even use the scroll wheel on the back to control it, you still have to use the thumb pad which means you have to pull it from your eye, seems kind of pointless. I would say this camera is not very customizable, if it were not for the Q button where you can scroll through pre-sets, but I would argue this is not customization, this just enables fast configuration changes. The screen and EFV will show the same info3) EFVThe OMD has a decent viewfinder. It is not very sharp even when adjusted with the diopter, I know it is not my eyes because I read at 20/15 since my Lasik.  Very little lag, even in low light.  The eye sensor works ok but could stand to be a bit faster. It throws up a nice large image about the same size as the OFV on the D7000.  Not sure why but you cannot have the EFV on non-stop, even when shutting off the rear display the EFV is off until the eye sensor is triggered.The XE1 has the same size viewfinder, but higher resolution and you can see the difference. Things look sharper and crisper, no doubt about it. However it is much laggier. The eye sensor is better though, and flips from screen to EFV faster.  You can leave the EFV on non-stop with the back off if you like.Build qualityThe OMD nice solid construction. Not a fan of the dials, the dials do feel a bit cheap. Weather sealed which is awesome! Some users of the OMD have had the dial pop off.The XE-1 also has a nice feel to it, but not as nice as the OMD. However the dials feel much better and more secure. It is NOT weather sealed at all. The compartment door on the side feels extremely cheap compared to the refined feel of the rest of the body.ErgonomicsOMD is not bad, it is a small camera, with small buttons a bit mushy because of the weather sealing but that does not bother me much. Without the grip it is ok for lighter lenses. I have the Panasonic 12-35 on mine and it really needs the grip.  Let's talk about the grip too, it really helps, but the bottom corner of it sort of digs into my palm on the large area at the base of the thumb. The battery grip helps, but I have been considering machining out a plate to attach to the bottom with a curved surface to help remove the bottom corner. The memory card is on the side which I prefer so you don't have to detach it from a tripod plate to swap out the memory card. Dials and buttons are well laid out in a nice intuitive manorXE-1 Better IMO ergonomically. It just feels awesome. However they focus light is on the grip? WTF? The 18-55 kit lens has some heft to it, but it still seems to balance without the need of a grip. The buttons are larger, fairly flush but stick out just enough. It is pretty darn comfortable to hold. I like how the viewfinder is not in the middle like the OMD, this means I don't have to bump my nose in the screen. The dials and buttons are very well laid out.  The memory card sits in the battery compartment like the NEX, I don't like this, I prefer to see it on the side..Image qualityThis horse has been beaten to death. You can find TONS of sample images and pixel peeping online. Basically 95% of the time the OMD will be more than good enough for what you need. The XE-1 in my opinion IS better, but not by a substantial amount in most scenarios. However one area the XE-1 shines is HIGH ISO. 6400 is perfectly usable on the XE1, but not the OMD. In fact, ISO 12,800 looks pretty darn good on the XE-1. Keep in mind there is not a lot of RAW support, Adobe LR, Photoshop, etc,. due to the non traditional bayer filter. However that may change. In the meantime if you do not mind shooting Jpeg the XE-1 has a killer jpeg engine in it and they look fantastic!VideoThe OMD is pretty decent for video, it is not up to par with many other cameras but the 5 way IBIS makes it seem like the camera is floating on a steady cam unit. No complaints on the video, not a lot of options, but it gets the job done.The XE-1 video is very very basic. This seems like it was added in because they felt it needed to be there for advertizing. It works, i would not expect this to become a new DSLR Video cult classic in any way.Image Stabilization.The OMD's 5 way IBIS is just awesome. This is by far the best image stabilization system available period. It really makes shooting in low light very, you can shoot 300mm at 1/15th of a second and keep it sharp. AWESOME!The Fuji XE-1 has stabilization in the lenses, so this may or may not get better and depends on the lens being used. My experience with the kit lens is that it does a good job, on par with Canon and Nikons IS/VR systems in thier lenses.Cool stuff specific to each camera.OMD -  Highlights and Shadows. How cool is this? it shows you live where you are clipping. I always have it ON with the OMD. I really like that featureOMD- Articulating screen. I was not a fan of the idea when this became popular, gotta admit, I have started to like it.XE-1 - DOF and manual focus bar. This is AWESOME. There Is a bar at the bottom of the screen/efv that indicates distance, there is a red line surrounded by a white bar that indicates the focus point. The red line is the exact center of the focus, the white bar shows you the depth of field. So when adjusting the aperture up the white bar expands and contracts to show the area that will be in focus. Using this you can manually focus in very low light with only knowing the approximate distance to the subject.XE-1 film simulation modes. I know I know, the OMD has Art modes. However to be honest, my personal opinion is most of the art modes are just stupid and I will never use them, they are too over the top, the only one I kind of like is the Dramatic Tone. The film simulation modes are just more subtle and does not look like it was heavily processed, it still looks like a natural photograph.XE-1 Pop up flash. I dig it, it is low powered, probably just enough to kick up shadows a bit in harsh sunlight conditions or to nudge up the shadows a bit on a backlit situation.  It goes INTO the camera and gets out of the way. you can also use it for bounce in smaller rooms. The OMD just has that goofy/stupid attachment flash that requires you to remove 3 separate plastic covers which can get lost.XE-1 Aperture ring! yes! I love the way this camera is setup. The shutter dial, aperture ring, give it a very nice feel.XE-1 High end kit lens? Yes! This kit lens is awesome! it has a wonderful feel, metal construction, very very smooth and competent feel to the focus and zoom rings.  Due to it being a variable aperture lens there is no hard stops on the aperture ring, but it does feel very good.In the end these are two very different cameras and do not make for a good comparison.The OMD is a Ninja, it is a Jack of all Trades and master of many, it is fast, efficient with excellent image quality. It is a finely engineered marvel of photographic joy.The Fuji XE-1 was clearly designed as a fun camera geared towards photographers. It takes more care and thought, and seems to have been intended with more of an artistic purpose. It has a lot of personality to it.The differences between the two really balance each other out, and I recommend them as a set. They are so different they almost feel natural together.As for which is better that depends on what you are into. If you need high speed system for fast changing environments the OMD is probably the better choice. The Fuji seems to be more of an artist's tool intended for deliberate shooting. Even though I will probably use the Fuji more than the OMD, I will probably take far more pictures with the OMD than the XE-1. I feel the OMD us something I will \"use\", the Fuji will be something I \"work with\". I suspect Leica is keeping a very sharp eye on the Fuji Xpro-1/XE-1 cameras, as they are the first ones to really start competing with Leica in the area that Leica dominates, and at a fraction of the price. I know that the Leica has a full frame sensor, keep in mind that Fuji's X-trans sensor is routinely (and rightfully so) compared to the Canon 5DmkII and the Nikon D700 full frame cameras. It IS that good.If I were only allowed to keep one, it would certainly be the XE-1. It really seems to hit what I want to do with my photography which is very slow and deliberate. If you are into wildlife, sports, etc., the OMD would be a better choice. In fact, for many people I think the OMD will be a better choice.[UPDATE DEC 31 2012]I have had a little bit more time with this camera, and have really been enjoying it. I still stand by my 3 star review even though i really enjoy this camera. I was hoping as i got to know the camera a little better i would find out that i was doing something wrong. The fact is the AF is still very slow, it has some shutter lag, and is in general a pretty unforgiving camera.This is a camera that rewards effort, that is not to say it fights you. It is an excellent choice for experience photographers or those keen on learning photography, Whereas the OMD seems to have Cleo the psychic crammed into it because it seems to read my mind and has lightning fast response like bruce lee.If you can just ante up and get both, you will have a really awesome combination for any situation.[Update 1/15/2013]I just got back from a week of hiking around Sedona Arizona, I took both the OMD and the Fuji XE-1 and my plan was to start out with the XE-1, then halfway through the hike switch to the OMD.  After a few days the OMD was just left at home. I love shooting with the XE-1 and just find it more enjoyable. The rest of my review still stands, the XE-1 is a camera you work with, the OMD is a camera you use.  The OMD has pretty much fallen as a backup for bad weather, and as my primary camera for time lapse photography while the XE-1 is my primary photography camera.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "My favorite camera of all time!", "Author": "Augsburg57", "ReviewID": "R36W6WMXU0MGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned a variety of cameras over the past 40 years and digital cameras in particular going back 15 years.  When I purchased the Fuji X-E1 in black with the 18-55 F2.8-4.0 zoom kit lens, a couple of weeks ago, I held on to my Nikon D700 and Olympus E-P2.  The D700 is a great camera and a wonderful friend over the past several years, and the E-P2 was pretty good - but had some issues.  However, within a few days after purchase of the X-E1, the D700 and E-P2 had been sold.  I don't think I will be looking back.A couple of days ago, I spent an afternoon with the X-E1 and took about 300 photos.  Wow, what a pleasure!  The size and layout are really good.  Not too small and fiddly like the Oly, and not too big and heavy like the D700.The X-E1 is a photographer's camera.  Controls are easy to use and well laid out.  But that's only half the story.  The image quality, low light performance and dynamic range are all fantastic - definitely surpassing the D700 in low light performance.  I could reliably shoot the D700 up to 1600 ISO, but the X-E1 does better at 6400 ISO than the full frame Nikon did at 1600!I have made all firmware updates (as of late December 2012), including both the body and lens.  Focusing is a non-issue for my camera.  I NEVER had the camera hunt or mis-focus with my 300 shots a couple days ago - and most shots were indoors!  My old D700 would not have done that well with autofocus.  The D700 would occasionally hunt and mis-focus.  And compared to the Oly E-P2, the Fuji's focus is night and day better.  During my afternoon of shooting - much with low light, I confirmed I can shoot reliably down to 1/15th second shutter speed with the image stabilized 18-55 lens.I love the Quick menu giving easy access for adjusting the X-E1.  The 18-55 lens is a great zoom, with fast glass (for a zoom) and ring adjustment of zoom, focus and aperture.  The small built in flash comes in handy. The Oly had no flash and it was always an inconvenience to pull out the external flash and mount it when needed.  Plus, the Oly had an external electronic view finder, which could not be mounted with the flash installed.The Electronic View Finder (EVF) is an excellent tool and I'd say I take 75% of my photos using the EVF.  When I purchased the X-E1, I considered the Sony RX1, but decided against it because: 1) no built in view finder, 2) lens could not be interchanged, and 3) user interface was too menu driven.  The Olympus OM-D E-M5 was considered, but the four thirds format does not match the Fuji X-E1 in low light performance.  I also considered the Fuji X-Pro 1 and would have gone for it, had it a built in flash.  I actually like the slightly larger size of the X-Pro 1.One of my favorite features of the Fuji X-E1, is the film simulation bracketing.  Fuji made several iconic films over the years and you can select three types from a list and bracket your shots with them.  I found in post production I would pick one film type or the other - depending on the shot.  So it really gives the photographer more choice.  And with the low cost of high capacity SD cards, space for bracketing shots is not a problem.My only issues with the camera are: 1) can't set a minimum shutter speed for full auto or in aperture priority; 2) Lightroom 4 does not yet process the raw files to their full potential.  Lightroom 3 (my preferred platform) does not handle the Fuji's raw files at all.  The camera shoots unbelievably good jpegs that require very little adjustment, however, so this is not a major problem.

Useability; not so much.", "Author": "Doctor.Generosity", "ReviewID": "REPAVLQ2P4PAH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I arranged to get these three top cameras at the same time and tested them on the same indoor shot (bookcase of colorful books) with room light at ISO 3200 and 800 and flash at ISO 200. Had to use different lenses of course (18-55mm zoom on Sony, 24-85mm zoom on Nikon, 18-55mm zoom on Fuji), and all shots were JPEGs, so this comparison does not make it possible to distinguish the relative contributions of sensors, lenses, jpeg processors. All the noise reduction settings were on defaults. Just for fun I threw in my Canon S95 pocket camera and my iPhone5. All pix were blown up to the screen equivalent of about 24\" wide.A word about JPEGs vs. RAW: It is important to understand that modern lenses including these three are no longer just hunks of glass; they are designed to be used with the in-camera JPEG processing firmware, which undoes the inherent distortions on the wide angle side. Vignetting is also corrected, and chromatic aberration. It is no longer necessary to design lenses depending so much on the difficult correction of glass elements with additional glass elements, aspherics, etc. Lenses are now part software, which results in better optics at lower cost. In principle a poor single element lens could give near perfect results, limited only by the processing power of the little computer in your camera. You can see this for yourself; watch the LCD image and then fire the shot - you'll see the replay image come up with the whole field visibly altered by software distortion correction. For this reason it would require a lot of skill and Photoshop time to do the same thing manually starting from the RAW images. JPEG's are the way these lenses are designed to be used, so that's how they should be evaluated, as part of the whole camera.Results at ISO 3200:- Nikon D600 (full frame) gave the nicest image, as we should certainly expect for the sensor size, camera size and weight, and cost. Image was creamy, clean and contrasty.- Fuji XE1 was second. Image was just a bit noisier and rougher than Nikon full frame.- Sony NEX6 was third. Although it had more contrast than the Fuji, this varied by colors; in some areas, such as red type on a blue book cover, the image actually washed out completely. Noisier than Fuji and evident compression artifacts.- Canon S95 quality is not in the same ballpark at high ISO and magnification; very rough.- iPhone5; like a juvenile delinquent in a class full of straight A students!Results at ISO 800:ISO 800 is my basic setting in daily photography. All three images were beautiful.- XE1 was the cleanest, but the Sony NEX had more punch and contrast.- Nikon D600 was a bit rougher and noisier than the other two, but of course had the highest pixel density when blown way up.Results at ISO 200:- Nikon D600, Fuji XE1 and Sony NEX 6 are quite comparable, with the choice being almost a matter of taste. Here the D600 is a bit noisier than XE1 in some areas and many people would say the Fuji XE1 half frame actually looks better overall than the Nikon full frame, which is remarkable. Sony NEX is right up there with them; the three images have different qualities, but there is no obvious winner. Canon S95, although still raggedy compared to this company, is not bad at all at low magnification and low ISO.What is amazing about comparing XE1 and D600 is not that the Nikon DSLR is superior but that it is only SLIGHTLY superior and then only under extremely low light and high magnification. Fuji really seems to have some special sauce on their half-frame sensor which allows it to capture photos almost as good as a full-frame DSLR. At ISO800, they are all very good but XE1 is best. If your goal is best image with least bulk to lug around, XE1 is the winner. The XE1 is an improvement over XPro-1, simpler, smaller, but still a bit quirky and the interface odd. Sony NEX was just a bit muddy at high ISO, but superb at ISO800 and below. Also, there are so many other good things about Sony NEX (focus peaking, in-camera HDR, articulated LCD, wireless, ability to use legacy lenses easily in MF mode, picture effects) that I use mine all the time.Let's talk about viewfinders. I have a soft spot for my Nikon, and greatly prefer the optical through-the-lens viewfinder to EVF or LCD, but objectively speaking, purely in terms of image quality per unit weight/size, there is no longer any real justification for DSLR. Fuji is a unique instrument for the photographic artist. Sony NEX is also so good as to make the need for full frame DSLR questionable, and is the most flexible, ergonomic and cleverly fabricated of the three. You may have various reasons to choose one of these three, but image quality is no longer the deciding factor. Finally, all three of these are cameras for photographic fanatics; for ordinary folks looking to capture uncropped snapshots in good light at a viewed size about 4x5, the tiny Canon S95 and iPhone5 results don't look that much worse to the naked eye.So that's the good news; now for the other news. If image quality were the ONLY consideration, we would all still be using 8X10 view cameras. There is also useability in day to day picture taking, and here the XE1 is going to make many photographers unhappy. Besides the EVF, which many folks will not like, the autofocus is slow and in some cases (60 mm lens) borderline unacceptable. Also the latency (time from button press to shutter release) is lacking. Although the XE1 looks like a Leica and has wonderful precision materials, it does not equal the Leica's lghtning fast street photography. The XE1 is quirky and idiosyncratic in its menus and has a significant learning curve. Five stars because the IQ is so outstanding, but an overall assessment would be lower.Update in June 2013: My predictions about customers not necessarily liking the XE1 even though the images it makes are stunning is proving to be correct. Fuji is reducing prices subtantially, which can only be because sales are not meeting projections. I suspect there are significant levels of returned product as well. In addition, the main reason for mirrorless was size and weight over DSLR, but Canon has recently put out the SL1 which is smaller and lighter than the XE1!Bottom line is that the XE1 is a lovely instrument but not for everyone; you really should try it out before buying.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Something about the picture quality..is AMAZING!", "Author": "Radio Man \"yarns13\"", "ReviewID": "R3K3GVCPECFO2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had my X-E1 a couple days so I won't write a book here, well maybe I will :). I also own the Olympus E-M5 and had the NEX-7 so I can compare this Fuji to it's competition a bit here. To the point, this X-E1 takes BEAUTIFUL pictures.. They are so nice even just browsing the thumbnails on my computer, this X-E1 is standing out as something special vs my NEX-7 and E-M5 to a degree. I find getting around on the X-E1 is super quick MUCH better than the Nex7,and the X-E1 is quite intuitive to use. The EVF is excellent, as good or better than the Nex7's and I have not noticed any lag despite a few people saying the X-E1 EVF refresh rate is slower than the NEX's EVF. I just haven't noticed any problem at all about it. The lcd screen looks just fine...great color, yes less pixel density than say a Nex or E-M5 but more accurate color..so which is better? Accurate color or more pixels..I prefer accurate color!  I currently have the 1.4 / 35mm lens so that's what I am using for my review by the way.Focus speed is pretty quick..also owning an X100 I'd say this is a bit quicker to a lot quicker to focus overall. I'd also say YES, it can hunt a bit in lower light. Manual focus actually works WELL this is a Fuji?..though if it had the Sony PEAKING type feature, that would be helpful. Unlike the x100 you don't need turn the focus ring forever. You can see a magnified view of your target, and it's clear enough thru the wonderful EVF that just slightly turning the focus ring will get you superb focus..even in VERY low light, if auto is hunting too much. I may rarely use this feature but the built in stitch panorama feature works INCREDIBLY well, BETTER than the Sony Nex7 I am surprised!. One other nice feature on the X-E1 is after you take the shot, in playback mode you can push the command dial in..this will bring up a zoomed in view of WHERE your focus was. This is useful so say you wanted to focus on the eyes..and it shows you really focused on an ear you can re shoot..well done Fuji! Those who may own an E-M5 it has a similar feature where on playback a little green box auto shows you WHERE the focus point was...sort of a tie here on that useful feature.The Q menu (QUICK MENU,) is wonderful and you can get to things usually buried in the menu rocket fast. As to this special sensor and no Moire pattern? Well it's very good, BUT I have seen some moire pattern on a jacket and jeans a couple of times, though less than my E-M5. Most of the pics I have taken with the X-E1 HAVE been Moire pattern free however!As many sample pictures may seem, if you leave in camera sharpening set to zero, and Noise reduction to zero the jpegs tend to be a tad soft. I bumped the sharpness up one notch, and NR down 1 notch, and the pictures have tons of detail now yet have virtually no noise even up to 1600 or 2000 iso in GOOD light.For raw files for now, for best results you need to use the included Silkypix software. It knows how to work with this special Fuji sensor. But unlike many people crying about it, Silkypix is not THAT bad..it does have a learning curve, it's rather clunky, YET powerful. I mostly use raw to correct white balance and or exposure compensation. For such small stuff like that, Silkypix is just fine..you can save the output as an uncompressed tiff file if you like, then finish up in LR or Photoshop or whatever graphic software you are more comfortable with..no worries!Two features I miss from the E-M5 vs the X-E1 are IN camera Pixel mapping, and the E-M5's GREAT 5 axis image stabilization. Fact is, you are going to have to raise the ISO up a bit higher on the X-E1 for a faster shutter speed in low light vs the Olympus if you don't want a blurry picture. Hence? The E-M5 will give you indoor pictures with lower noise as the iso can be set lower than the X-E1. If you buy the Fuji zoom lens however, it IS an optically stabilized lens so in that case the E-M5 may not be much better as to image stabilization. You can then lower the iso on the X-E1 in low light depending upon the aperture you choose of course. The zoom is a VERY fast lens for a Zoom fast as in 2.8 aperture vs the norm at 3.5, But the E-M5 has IN body stabilization so ANY lens you pop on it will be stabilized...a plus for the E-M5.If you want a camera that is made REALLY well, is very quick to operate has amazing accurate color ESPECIALLY skin tones (Best I have ever seen) don't like that Sony color?? and Olympus just doesn't sing to you..this X-E1 can take breath taking photos! I should have said this earlier, to me what sets this X-E1 apart from it's competition MOSTLY is it's film like picture quality and VERY accurate pleasing color. As much as I love my E-M5 it does not show color as accurately as the FUJI, and the Sony Nex(s) tend to have that cool Sony Color..yellowish skin tones always. Fuji X-E1 you no need spend so much time post processing it just has accurate color almost always, without tweaking anything. :) I have to say I still love my E-M5 too, and it's focus speed is way faster than the Fuji BUT to my eyes OOC pics from the E-M5 are just no match for the Fuji ESPECIALLY color accuracy(Repeating) and a hard to put my finger on, film like silky quality that this X-E1 has. Great little camera overall!! Didn't give it 5 stars cause the auto focus could be quicker and it has a tad too much iso noise above 1600 in low light..BUT OVERALL a GREAT camera!(Adding this about a week later) I was wrong..low light iso is definitely better than my E-M5 much tighter grain and less grain..compared many same pictures iso side by side. Maybe about a tie with the NEX7 or a bit lower noise. Raising my prior 4 star review to 5!! Biggest downside is you can find faster auto focus in a Nex or EM5..but this XE1 is pretty fast to focus..it's just not EM5 quick. GREAT camera!!Added Dec 30..if you may want the smallest possible case for the XE1 WITH Kit Lens? I searched high and low and the Lowepro Munich 100 case has a perfect snug fit, it seems well made too. For me as this camera is small, certainly vs a DSLR, I don't want a huge case. This case is for the camera with attached kit lens only. No room for an extra lens etc. I don't use the strap..so that may or may not fit here.  Thought this may help somebody IF you want a good small case for this great camera.http://www.amazon.com/Lowepro-Munich-100-Camera-Bag/dp/B003X1M3FS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1356892704&sr;=1-1&keywords;=lowepro+munich+100", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "back to the future...", "Author": "2bkalm..", "ReviewID": "R3GS5TKI197Z74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I stepped away from photography some time ago ,but now I'm back...

I need my camera to fit under a shell for winter hiking, where every half-pound counts. And I want to bring it to a variety of events without it feeling like a millstone. My priorities are: (1) beautiful lens options; (2) beautiful sensor; (3) \"mirrorless\"/small form factor if possible. I also wanted to get a decent prime and a zoom up front. Luckily for me, the X-E1 was released right before I was ready to upgrade. This holiday with extended family clinched it: when it was portrait time, all the fancy huge Nikons came out, but no one even tried to bring them along on any outings or activities (and I don't blame them), leaving me to document everything with only a point-and-shoot camera.So we went with the Fuji (kit plus a beautiful 35 mm prime) and have been thrilled with its performance. I've carried it on long runs through the fog. I've brought it with me on several winter hiking expeditions. I've used it for winter family activities with lots of fast kid action. I've used it in low-light museums and zoos. The Fuji's sensor and lens qualities speak for themselves. In addition to ego gratifying praise from friends and family, I've had requests to use my photos for promotional purposes. My hiking friends and I also actively debate the best third generation camera to carry along, and we've been doing direct comparisons between the Fuji and the (half-pound lighter) Sony. No question that the Sony is a really nice camera, but the images out of the Fuji are really stunning and the Fuji wins hands down.The X-E1 satisfies all my camera priorities, and is fun and stylish to boot with convenient exposure and speed dials. Beyond the sale kit that comes with a 18-55 mm f2.8-4 zoom and the great 35 mm f1.4 prime, Fuji is expected to release a 55-200 mm f3.5-4.8 telephoto, as well as a superwide 10-24 mm zoom. I'm already thinking about these as well as a 56 mm f1.4 prime for portraits. There's also adapters for just about every lens out there if you're okay to give up AF and OIS through the adapter. Buying the X-E1 really means buying into Fuji's XF System lens options, and these are a beautiful set of lenses.The Bayer versus Fuji X-Trans sensor array is academically interesting to me, but I honestly haven't seen or read anything yet that proves the superiority of the X-Trans over a lpf Bayer output. In practice nevertheless, I swear by the Fuji's image quality, which speaks for itself. Most image quality is determined by non-ideal exposure issues anyway, and you're lucky if you get to worry about the theoretical performance limits of sparse array sampling on your (X-Trans) sensor. As for X-Trans RAW conversion, the current options are in-camera processing, Photoshop CS6, Lightroom, iOS PhotoRAW, SilkyPix, and maybe a few others. SilkyPix has the rep for the best performance so far -- even over in-camera processing, but yuk on its UI and workflow. There's fair internet grumbling about lack of decent support from Apple and Adobe for X-Trans RAW conversion and chroma smearing in ARC, but I'm shooting all raw and use ARC now and will reprocess in a year or so if I think Adobe has improved their demosaicing algorithm.The standard camera accessories have all worked great with the X-E1. My favorites are: a B+W Kaesemann CPL especially for outdoors shooting, a one dollar Bower Pro Lens Cap Keeper -- you're guaranteed to lose the 35 mm f1.4's lens hood cover without one of these, a Eye-Fi wifi SD card to compensate for the X-E1's lack of wifi and gps, and an Apple Mac AC power adapter duck head to replace the unwieldy cord that comes with the battery charger. I also really like Rico Pfirstinger's book \"Mastering the Fujifilm X-Pro 1\" even for the X-E1. I'd also recommend following the good advice to be found on the X forums and the internets: update your body and lens firmware right away, and this dpreview thread (\"Thanks, DPR. These X-E1 AF tips actually work\") recommends improving close-range AF speeds by, counterintuitively, turning off the AF Assist Lamp and using a LARGE AF square, advice I've found to work.The X-E1 is really a great camera that I've waited a long time to enjoy.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm X-E1 is the camera I have been waiting for.", "Author": "Kent", "ReviewID": "R2PFGH08K7DDGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long time professional photographer and have yearned for a small, light weight interchangeable lens camera for many years.

I've never minded it. Sure it's not as fast as a SLR. But I'm always pre-focusing or manually setting the focus by distance etc. Even in SLRs I do this. I prefocus and wait for the moment. Or as an example of another trick, for my kids, I might set the focus to 5 feet manually, make sure my aperture gives me enough depth of field, and follow them around the playground composing and shooting at arm's length. Works great for action shots.The image quality is second to only full frame cameras. Detail and ISO performance are amazing. ISO 6400 is other cameras' 800. So you're getting faster, cleaner, sharper shots. And lastly, but maybe best of all, is the dynamic range. It's huge. And somehow Fuji can translate that dynamic range to jpeg files in camera!

That's wrong.  You want a 58mm clear lens protective filter.Fuji has nothing to do with this mistake: it's all Amazon's fault.Now, about the camera: as you can see if you look at earlier reviews by me, I bought an X100 a couple of years ago and my wife simply adores that camera.  Her only complaint: no zoom.  And by only, I mean Only.  In all other ways the X100 is amazing.The X-E1, however, is better.  A lot better, actually.  OK, so it doesn't have a composite viewfinder... actually, that's fine.  We were never sold on it, anyway.  The eyepiece now shows you precisely what the sensor is seeing - how is that anything but great?  If your eye sees it, the sensor sees it.  Perfect - particularly given all of the information available in the viewfinder, if you want it.Automatic mode is incredible.  Take a photo of a black dog - routinely impossible for most cameras - and see what happens.  The fur comes alive.  The subtleties of the dog's eyes and black nose leap off the screen.  Instead of a black shadow, you see a dog - even in pretty low light conditions.  The picture depth is amazing.  Bokeh is awesome.Many years ago the SLR makers were finally getting \"auto\" right.  I owned a Pentax that would truly take an awesome picture if I bought 400 (or faster) film, and ran it on Auto.  From then until now I've never owned a digital camera that could do the same.  Auto always resulted in great outdoor (full light) shots, but indoor shots were murky or - worse - washed out by a flash that was way too strong.Not this camera.  This is the camera that will take interior shots of that cathedral you are visiting.  This is the camera you take into the caves during a winery tour.  This is the camera that you macro-set and take a shot of a flower, even in low-ish light.  It has a built in panoramic function.  Go to the beach or the mountains and take your panoramic shot.  Let that huge-sensor absorb every detail, while Fuji's brilliant electronics stitch the image together flawlessly.Most people are using their smart phones to take photo's, and I do too.  Those are analogous to what Kodak was doing in the 1970's.  Cheap cameras taking absolutely OK photo's, easily.  There's a time and a place for that.When you take a photo with this camera you remember: there was a reason that people turned to 35mm SLR's.  A photograph *can* be art.  There are subtleties that your camera-phone will never see, because the aperture is simply too small on a phone.  Not with the X-E1.  Big lens, big aperture, uber-dense sensor, and magnificent electronics - all in a camera that fits in your hand.  Remember that: this camera is significantly smaller than the DSLRs out there.  It's bigger than the small point-and-shoot's that you buy at the Big Box, but not by much.The build quality is superb.  The camera is light without being flimsy.  There's a heft to it that says \"well built.\"  What appears to be aluminum is used in a lot of places - where others would use a cheaper, and less durable, plastic.

Nothing like 11-16 F2.8 Tokina / 70-20mm F2.8 Sigma options for Nikon system, although Fujinon 56mm F1.4, 55-200MM F3.5-4.8 OIS and 10-24mm F4 OIS options are forthcoming in 2013.4. No min shutter speed setting while in AutoISO feature5. No focus peaking feature (while focusing manually)Is it perfect? No. Is it as versatile as my Nikon D90? No.Is it good enough for my needs?

He was very  excited about it.  I found many other reviews for x100s all over the internet, and all of them said how fantastic the camera was.  Comments like 'best camera in the world', 'wow', 'fantastic colors', 'what a camera' appeared in practically every review. The number of superlatives used were unprecendented and I could find only a few negative but tolerant remarks mainly on the AF speed.  Many reviews were from well established photographers.  I got very curious. What is this camera, which is igniting such a following?  Could Fuji be 'salting' the reviews and paying famous photographers to give a positive review?  But then, can they influence so many of them?  Seemed unlikely.  I went to Amazon, my favourite place for trusted and unbiased reviews and again found raving reviews.  I was hooked.But the price $1,299 intimated me.  Was a fixed lens camera, how ever good, worth that kind of money?  My budget is scarce and I have a T3i/24-105 L for my work.  If I sell my Canon gear will it fetch me enough to buy the x100s?  And most importantly, can the x100s do everthing my current gear can do?  All the talk about 'zoom with your feet and you will become a better photographer' is fine, but in reality when you are shooting for clients, there is little time to waste.  I decided to reserch the Fuji X product line and see if there are other alternatives.I found the X-E2.  This seemed to be God sent because it was similar to the x100s but with interchangable lenses.  But at that time it cost $1,400, $100 more than the x100s.  It put me off and I decided to wait. Then Fuji announced the X-T1 and after a week, the price of X-E2 dropped to $1,300 and it became the same as x100s (whose price refused to drop even after a year).  Now X-E2 looked more attractive and I resumed my research.  Again found many glowing reviews about the X-E2 (but not as glowing as those of x100s) and made up my mind to get it as soon as possible.While I was deciding from which store to buy it, the price of X-E1 dropped to $799.  This was getting more interesting and I compared the X-E2 with X-E1.  Generally everyone agreed that X-E2 was a better camera in terms of AF speed and some other less critical fixes, but it was not a major upgrade from X-E1 (which is in my estimate is around 95% the same as X-E2 after the firmware upgrades).  In that case, why not go for a X-E1 and save $500?  Honestly, I was tempted also by the X-M1 which is much cheaper but gave it up because it did not have a view finder.  Digging deeper I found that many people found the IQ of X-E1 more 'natural' than the IQ of X-E2.  The noise reduction in X-E2 seemed to be very aggressive which made skin tones look like one of Madame Tussad's creations.  I pored over the comparisons in dpreview.com and found that the reivews were correct. There was a tendency for X-E2 and X-T1 to smooth skin a little too aggressively for higher ISOs.  I ordered the X-E1.  I know I am maybe two geneations behind the latest Fuji cameras but I trust my instincts and don't think I will disappointed.  Also, now perhaps I may not have to sell of my Canon gear (which I dearly love) to pay for the X-E1.Reached home from work at about 6 pm and found the package waiting for me at the front door.  Excited, I took it in and opened it.After removing the packing, Adorama documents and their gifts, I found the black box containing the camera and the lens.  I had built up so much anticipation over a period of time for this camera that I found my breath quickening when I opened the box.  My first impression was one of disappointment.  The camera looked a little worn out, dull and lifeless.  The matt black covering of the body reminded me of my father's Rollie. My wife saw me looking at it and asked me if I had ordered a used camera.  As I stared at it, I realized that it was not dull but understated.  There was a quiet shine to the silver and the black and it looked dignified.  This camera was built for someone who was mellow, cultured and sophisticated.  The lens was all black and had a luxurious finish to it.  I removed the covers and fixed the lens to the camera. Later when I left it on the dining table, it blended into the background and I realized that this effect was deliberate (I read somewhere that Fuji spent a lot of time deciding the colors and the finish) and this camera was not for the flashy photographer who liked to show off his equipment but for a sedate one who wanted to unobtrusively take good pictures without being obvious.I switched on the camera and looked through the view finder.  The view was very contrasty and bright.  I did not like it too much but I dont think there is an option to tone it down, other than reduce the brightness.  But then I realized it was in keeping with the general philosophy of the camera.  Nondescript on the outside and bright and efficient on the inside.  There is some WYSIWYG in the screen and it does approximately reflect the exposure of the scene.  The screens dims and brightens when you place the focus frame on different parts of the scene.  This is one of my primary reasons for buying a camera belonging to this genre.  In my T3i, I have to guess how the final scene will turn out and frequently have to adjust after taking the picture and examining it on the screen.  In the X-E1 (and similar cameras) you can actually see how the scene will look like before releasing the shutter.  This is a great aid to composition.I pointed it at things around the house and took some pictures.  AF was slow and there was a distict shutter lag.The EVF could not keep up with the scene when I panned.  But no surprises.  The shutter seemed to make a grating noise and I was a little worried.  I researched it later and found that my camera was not different.  I was used to the crisp Canon shutter sound and found this one a little different.  I attached the camera to my laptop and viewed the pictures.  I was shocked.  All were blurry and out of focus.  Where was the much touted Fuji sharpness?  I examined the camera settings and found that the ISO was 200 and shutter speed was 1/15.  Relieved I realized that the blur was due to camera shake and not the camera's fault.  I set it to Auto ISO of 6400 and shot some more.  This time pictures were much better and sharp.  But AF was slow and shaky.  When I set the Auto ISO, I noticed that the options for setting the Minimum Shutter speed and Default were missing, and and realized that the firmware was not the latest.  I went online and updated the body and lens firmware.  Updating was pretty simple.  Just copy the file to your memory card, insert the card into the camera and run update.  Takes about a minute.Again shot some photos and now it was much much better.  Quicker response, better AF performance and seems altogether a different camera.  I decided to test the skin tone rendition.  I asked my wife to pose for a few photos.  Since I started photography 4 years back, I have never been able to render my wife's and daughter's complexions exactly (or more importantly as they liked it).  Hours in Photoshop, adjusting CMYK and white balance did help a little but I could never match the tone and complextion exactly.  The skin looked either yellow or blue or too red.  This has been a constant source of complaint from my wife, so much that she nowadays refuses to let me photograph her.  I downloaded the photos from Fuji and showed it to her.  'What did you do this time?' she asked, 'this is exactly what I look like'.  I could have told her that I had done nothing and these are the OOC jpegs from the camera, but why waste a good opportunity?  I gave her a discourse on white balance and how I had used Photoshop to fine tune the photos.  It seemed to impress her and she said 'At least you have got it correctly now'.  What ever this camera cannot do, I am keeping it for this one great feature.  Perfect white balance and skin tones, approved by my wife.The color accuracy is remarkable.  I have not used any other digital camera whose color rendering is so close to the actual.  Almost felt like a film camera. The noise reduction is set to 0 but I hardly see any noise even at ISO 6400 unless I enlarge to 100%.  The low light performance is so good that the camera can practically see in the dark.  I no longer need be afraid of high ISOs.Overall I am not used to the handling as yet.  My T3I was much bigger and I had put on the Snug It case over the camera which gave it a soft feel and was very comfortable in the hand.  Compared to that I felt a lot of sharp edges on the X-E1.  The thing is small.  Unless you have handled a SLR for 4 years and suddenly handle one of these, you dont realize how small.  It felt like a toy and the in the beginning I was unconciously handling it gingerly, perhaps in the fear of breaking it.  But then I had opted for the Fuji because I had wanted a smaller and lighter camera, so cannot fault its size.  The camera is not delicate but the size makes you feel it is, and it take some getting used to. The shutter button is not comfortable and lacks a nice feel and tactile feedback when you half press and then shoot.  I decided to buy a third party soft release button.  The On/Off switch is thin and sharp.  Should be bigger and more comfortable to use.  The dials are excellent and smooth.  The flash is well concealed and adequate.  The connector cover inadvertently flips open if you brush you hand against it.The button placement is very convenient.  I really liked the AF and AE button on the left side.  With the AE button I can quickly change the metering mode to suit the scene and the look I want.I dont know if I will use the AF button much to change the focus point because I am primarily a lock focus-recompose-shoot kind of photographer.  But it will be interesting to use.The lens is very well made and solid.  Beautiful lens, as good as my Canon 24-105.  Smooth zoom and manual focus.  The aperture ring clicks satisfactorily.  The lens cap is atrociously bad and seems cheap.  So does the lens hood.  I wonder why Fuji compromised on these two items when they had built the camera and lens so well.  The camera strap is inadequate and thin.  Another compromise.  When handling the camera, I found that there was no comfortable position to place the thumb without accidently changing the Command dial or the Selector switches.  Due to this the grip on the camera is precarious at best and my recommendation is to wear it around the neck or hand to avoid dropping it accidently.  I think I will buy one of those Thumb Grips.  The screen is a print magnet and needs a screen protector.Another disappointment is the Exposure brackting.  I shoot HDR sometimes and +1 and -1 is not sufficient. I need at least +2 and - 2.  I guess I will have use the Exposure compensation and adjust according to the scene or shoot 2 sets of images after setting different exposure compensation values.Used it for a few days now.  The battery life is very bad.  Yesterday when I had taken it out for a street photography run, half way through it ran out of juice.  I did not have a spare on me and I had to return home unfulfilled.  I later found out that you can increase the battery life by1. Shutting off the LCD and using only EVF.  In this mode, I wish the camera has a feature where by the EVF comes on only when you lift the camera to your eye.  This would further save some power.2. Switch off the Quick Start mode.3. Reduce the auto switch off time.4. Reduce EVF brighness to minimum.5. Diasable the image review option after every photo.  You can always press the review button to review your shot if needed.Also, the Lithium batteries would take 4 ot 5 full re-cycles to acheive full power.But it is perfect for street photography.  When I try to use my Canon for shooting on the street, more than once I have been stopped by stares and even a few angry comments.  But, when I used the Fuji, the camera is so small and looks so harmless, that nobody pays any attention and one person with dogs even invited me to take his photograph.I tried the camera in various conditions indoors and outdoors1. Color are very accurate.  It depends on the film simulation you choose but very accurate.2. The auto exposure is perfect.  In very contrastly scenes too, it somehow is able to reduce highlights blow out and also bring out some details in dark shadows.  Of course, it does have 3 levels of DR settings which would further help in reducing contrast.  But, higher DRs increase the noise.  The highlight mode and shadow mode settings further help in bringing out details in shadow and highlights.3. The number of customization possibilities are incredible.  T3i does not have the facility to save custom settings and I found this feature very useful to quickly change the setting depending on the scene.  Combined with the film simulations, the flexibility of the settings lets you set it exactly as you need.I have not used Silkypix as yet but I downloaded an opensource RAW convertor called Lightzone.  Works well.Altogether, as many people have said earlier and which I had then swallowed with a grain of salt, the camera is a joy to use.  It's like driving a sports car or using a precision instrument.  The satisfaction from using it comes from its predictability.  You can predict how the final picture will come out.  This, I think, is the X-E1s greatest strength.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice camera-great IQ", "Author": "James C. Cassatt", "ReviewID": "RY833L2LC1073", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like many owners of Canon SLR systems (in my case a 5D MKIII with a variety of L lenses) I wanted something that I could carry around and not break my back.  The Fujifilm X-E1 fits that role beautifully.I purchased the camera, \"kit\" zoom (18-55 f2.8-4) and the 35 mm f1.4 from Amazon.  Delivery was prompt.The camera and lenses are solidly build.  The user interface is as good as I ever encountered.  I was up and running immediately without even looking at the manual.  I love the combo of the X-E1 and 35 mm f1.4.  Reminds me of my old days when all I could afford was the 50 mm lens that came with the camera.  The lens is first rate, sharp wide open and below.  Comparing the same picture taken with my 5D MKIII and 85 mm f1.8 (distance adjusted for FOV), the results are nearly identical.The \"kit\" lens is solid and a good performer.  However, in pixel peeping mode it is not quite as sharp as the 5D MKIII with its kit lens (24-105 f4L) lens attached.  However, when printed in any sort of reasonable size, I doubt you will be able to see the difference.A lot has been written about the high ISO performance of the X-E1.  It is remarkable for a cropped frame camera.  I shoot routinely at ISO 3200 without noise reduction.  8x10 inch prints at ISO 6400 show no noise.The camera has an electronic viewfinder.  It takes a bit of getting used to, but it works quite well.  In a sense what you see is what you get.  That is, the picture that comes right after it is taken looks like what you saw in the viewfinder, just before you took it.  I rather like the idea of being able to see the picture right after taking it without taking the camera away from the eye.  The refresh rate is quite good, but it is an EVF not an optical viewfinder.So much for the good.  Now for the not so good.  We have become spoiled by dSLRs with rapid follow focus.  Since I have a 5D MKIII, I would not use this camera to photograph my grandsons' soccer games.  Were I to shoot action, I go back to basics and anticipate the action and prefocus.The focusing is slow compared to my 5D MKIII and other dSLRs I have used.  In general this is not a problem, and the latest firmware upgrades have gone a long way to correct the issue.  However, I tried the camera out in a studio situation with a live model and found the autofocus painfully slow.  Nonetheless, it was usable.More serious for me is the lack of high speed sync on any flash made by Fujifilm for this camera.  I am eagerly awaiting the release of the 60 mm f1.4 lens.  This should be perfect for portraits.  However, I like to use fill flash when taking outdoor portraits.  Taking advantage of the very wide aperture offered by that lens will make it impossible to use fill flash (max sync speed = 1/180 sec) without resorting to neutral density filters.Much has been made of the \"Water Color\" effects and color running in the RAW images.  I have not fussed over this so far, and I hope will get this sorted out.With the caveats above, I would recommend this camera.  It is a lot more discreet that my 5D MKIII with an L lens attached.  IQ, especially with the 35 mm f1.4 is outstanding up to ISO 3200, and I find it really easy to use.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Bigkidneys", "ReviewID": "R1UKEDL2FS2ZS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First review I have done on here and giving it five stars.  Had the Xpro1 but felt it was too big, expensive, and I never used the OVF so it made no sense for me to keep it.  Been going back and forth between the Fuji and OM-D.  The Oly is a great camera and the system has some wonderful lenses.  The image quality I get from the Oly is just slightly under what the Fuji gives me.  The Fuji jpegs are great as I only shot raw prior to getting the Xpro1.  Overall, verry happy with this kit.  The 18-55 is prettyfast to AF but of course not a DSLR.  For those people shooting static objects or even kids you shouldn't have an issue.  If you want to shoot sports daily and have tones of keepers, yoyu may want to look at something else.

FOr the past 8 years, every time I traveled, I carried along my DSLR with me. I have been using Rebels, D80, D90, and all the way to 5d MK II. I spent quite a lot on lenses. I am not a pro photographer. I just love travelling and taking pictures. I've traveled to many places around the world carrying a DSLR with a huge lens on it, plus few more in the backpack. Last time I went out was few months ago during a trip to southern France. I remember the pain on my shoulders at the end of the day, caused by carrying the camera and lenses. My wife kept on saying to me that she won't help me taking a picture because she always have trouble steadying the camera due to its weight.Now she wont have any excuses since I bought the little gem. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much. Coming from full frame sensors and L lenses, I am used to sharp pictures, high ISO performance, great OOC image quality, buttery bokeh, bright view finders....etc. But lugging them around, the weight, the attention I get, are stopping me from taking the camera out on more often or on a casual base. The little X-E1 has changed everything. All that DSLR offers, X-E1 got them all, except the optical viewfinder of course. But I don't find myself missing it. After purchasing it, I've taken it to the restaurant, the beach, the golf courses, pool, dog walk, walmart, even a trip to the dumpster. It's a camera that you would love to take it out shooting.You can take it anywhere, and the image quality just never disappoints. Oh, I stopped shooting raw since I got this camera, RAW files took up too much disk space and PP has been a huge time sink. The JPEG out of this camera is stunning. You need to familiarize with it first though. Tweak its settings to your liking. Well thats what I did at least. Dont slack off on studying it but it really doesn't take much effort or time. Make use of it's film simulations, it's surprisingly good. The menu is very clear and purposeful. Functions are listed very logically. The controls are very intuitive, a bit small but very sturdy feeling, unlike the nex I had before which felt flimsy and plastic. Everything seems to be well thought off, nothing more, nothing less. I also like the retro silver top, more than the black one. I will be purchasing the leather half case to compliment its retro appearance.Regarding everyone's doubt on its focusing speed, it's a non-issue. Turn off the focus assisting light, you are golden. Make sure you update your firmware too. It's not hard at all. The battery life is better than I expected. But I still ordered 2 more from Amazon. I am not big into shooting videos but this camera's video capability is more than what I ever needed. Comparing to Nex 6, its direct competitor, the only thing I MIGHT miss is the wifi function. It's fun to load the image straight from the camera to my ipad. But it's a gimmick I can live without. It's much much faster just pull out the SD card and let the card reader do the job.Future improvements? A little thicker grip would definitely help, a tilt screen perhaps, oh yes, the Wi-Fi.With the price reduction, which made the whole package even a closer price match to the nex, stop (re)searching, buy it, go out and start taking pictures!P.S. I have to give props to Amazon, 10 days after I bought the camera with the kit 18-55, the price dropped. I called them in the middle of the night, they agreed to refund the difference right away.

The X-E1 loses 0.3 points for some quirks, which still rounds up to five stars...The quirks:1)autofocus - it is not lightning fast, and can be fooled in low light close-ups2)EVF appears magnified - when you look into it, it feels like you're using a magnifying glass at very slight magnification.  The screen is clear and detailed though.3)Slow refresh rate - it's true what others have mentioned.  If you pan left to right, you will see the screen image is not keeping up.4)Memory card is hard to reach - To remove the memory card, you have to pinch it on its sides.  The compartment cover's placement is causing clearance problems.5)No lens cap strap - The lens cap is hard enough to use, it is also easy to lose because it has no strapHaving said all that, I still think this is one awesome camera.  I bought the silver unit with the 18-55mm kit lens.  When you order, I recommend you buy at least one extra battery.  I personally wish I bought two extra batteries.  I get eye strain from using EVFs in general, so I use the main screen more.  But since it uses more energy, the battery life is just as short as any prosumer camera.  Speaking of main screens, as someone else mentioned, it's a pretty good screen.  I don't think it could have used more pixels.  Personally, I would trade not having an EVF for a bigger main screen or the X-Pro1's better screen.Burst speed is very good.  I paired this with my SanDisk Extreme Pro Class 10 UHS-1 95MB/s SDHC card.  On the specs, it says the buffer is only good for 6 shots but I actually don't notice it slow down until 11 shots of raw and high quality jpg.  The 6fps is very nice.  If you shoot in Fine jpg only, once the buffer fills up, it flushes the backlog to the card in not so much time.Like on many other reviews, it praises the film modes.  I now understand why.  I set mine to Velvia all the time now, and I don't see any need to run the pics through Lightroom at all.  The pictures are great out of the box.Low light performance is excellent.  A few years ago, using ISO 800 and not having noise was quite an achievement.  With the X-E1, you can go up to ISO 25,600 with not much worry.Lastly, the simplicity of the controls is excellent.  No other Compact System Camera is this simple.  Yes, the dial on the right is for shutter speed.  Mainly, I just set the shutter to A (Auto), the ISO limit to 6400, so the camera will adjust those for me.  What I do control is the aperture using the aperture ring like any regular DSLR.  This has worked well for me.  I've had several slr and prosumer cameras, which you just click click your way hoping a few will turn out well.  With my settings, I now get to think about framing and controlling depth of field.  Those two have the most impact on the final product.  Think of it this way.  For a long time, most cars have automatic transmissions.  The newer performance cars have dual-clutch transmissions that shift lightning fast and give you significant control.  Using the X-E1 is like driving a performance car with a dual-clutch transmission.Anyway, if you can put up with the cons, you'll have one extremely good camera that takes excellent pictures.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Delightful camera", "Author": "Richard Ballina", "ReviewID": "RXVDVWZOTMX61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I suppose I'm a photography enthusiast having been playing with cameras since a child.

Fuji has put back manual controls, such as aperture rings on lenses, exposure compensation dials, etc.  Fuji has produced and extraordinary sensor, and shrunk the whole thing in a way that makes my heavy Nikon D7000 seem like a relic from another era, which it is.Added to that comes a choice of superb lenses and the best after sales support from any camera manufacturer I've ever encountered.  Fuji has practically reinvented its X100 and XPro-1 since being first released with significant firmware upgrades.  The same too, to a slightly lesser extent, with my XE-1.  Fuji is updating cameras in the same way Apple updates its iPhone, bringing new benefits to its customers and building loyalty.  I feel you can invest safely in the Fuji system.I'm not inclined to write reviews, but Fuji has produced such superb cameras with its X series, followed up with great firmware improvements, kept it all light, small and price competitive.

The size is just right, allowing you to grab images without looking \"professional\".  The colors are really nice on the portrait side of things.  The jpegs are really second to none, I shoot raw still but find the jpegs can be hard to match.  The noise performance is really up there compared to even some FX sensors cameras.  The only down side is the auto focus, which is actually not horrible but not up to DSLR caliber stuff.  It's not a deal breaker but something you learn to over come as every camera has something that makes you adjust to. The fuji updates have made the camera work well, which just doesn't happen with other camera manufacturers.  I have used this in low light without issue and managed to grab many sports photos.  I wouldn't buy this as a primary sports camera but it will do the job if you understand the camera and how it works.  The only other concern I have is flash use, fuji is no where near canon or nikon when it comes to this area.  There isn't a lot of TTL off camera functionality and this has been a steep learning curve. Manual flash is not too difficult to learn but something I'm not all that comfortable with.

It's not a camera that you can just point and shoot and pray, but all your efforts will be rewarded at the end.People have written much better and professional reviews that I will ever be able to, I am just going to jog down a few points that I can think of.Color: 10/10No complaints. Comes with the \"Fuji\" color that a lot of people love. Compare it with a Sony NEX or Nikon DSLR, you will love Fuji's color. It doesn't have a lot of fancy filter presets like Olympus and Sony, but I think all those \"artistic\" and \"HDR\" effects are just gimicks, people serious in learning photograpy will find Fuji's color effects, e.g. Velvia, Astria, etc good enough. Also worth mentioning that the Auto WB is very decent and always seems to be able to pick a good color profile.\"Bokeh\": 10/10Love love love the creamy Bokeh. If you like out-of-focus shots with creamy bokeh, you will be in love.Focus: 7/10You have to know what you are getting into, this is a mirrorless camera (so will be much slower than DSLR), and this is not the best mirrorless in terms of focus speed. You will likely not able to focus in time for shooting any kind of moving objects like airshow or sports event, this camera is for street photography, portrait shots and still shots, and its focus is definitely good enough for above scenarios.ISO: 4/10This is the area I feel cheated a bit. I think Fuji is overstating their ISO, by a lot. I think X-E1's ISO3200 is roughly comparable to Sony NEX's ISO1600, hence the supposedly superior ISO performance. But if you put both camera at ISO3200 with same aperture, Fuji's shutter speed will be almost twice at Sony's. Noise at ISO3200 is definitely usable, but it's not amazing as the numbers suggest.Lens: 10/10I have the 18-55mm \"kit\" lens and there is nothing kit about that lens. It's a good solid good lens with very bright high-quality glass, I would recommend everyone to start with that lens. Just to think it's twice bright than the garbage kit lens Canon and Sony give us! It also focuses faster than the prime lens. And in 2013 they will have fantastic wide angle and a 200mm zoom lens. It's surprising that Fuji already has a better lens line-up than the whole NEX series... are you listening Sony?Ergonomics: 6/10Not very good actually... the camera is large, the kit lens is almost same weight as the body so it's a bit front-heavy. Paired with a rather flat hand grip, it's a bit hard to get comfortable with it. On the other hand, I love the location of the aperture ring and exposure dial.Build quality: 8/10I have read some famous, but rather unprofessional reviews online saying that this camera is all metal and build quality rivals Leica. Errr... no. This camera feels exactly like a $1000 camera. Solid, good quality, but not Leica in anyway. In fact I think the lens is much higher quality than the body itself. The black portion of the body is plastic, and the body feels less solidly linked together than NEX.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Camera I've Owned", "Author": "Ronald F.

However, over the years I've been moving towards smaller, lighter, high-image-quality cameras and simplifying my kit.  I found that I very seldom used the Optical Mode of the Viewfinder in the X-Pro1.  That finder design adds size and weight to the Pro1.  So, when this came to market I bought one.  It is 22 percent lighter than the Pro1, smaller, has exactly the same capabilities (menus, controls, IQ) in a smaller, lighter, lower cost package.  Also, the Electronic Viewfinder is much improved over the Pro1 and Fuji added a Pop-Up flash.  Now I can use the Pop-Up in Commander Mode to fire my off-camera flash.  I'm using this camera with Fuji's 35mm f1.4 which is a superb lens.  Soon I'll order the 18-55mm and expect that will complete my kit, meeting all my needs.

My next Fuji was the X100 which I found quite frustrating, what with slow start-up times, poor focus, non-functioning manual focus; I traded it for a Nex 7.While the Nex 7 is a pretty good camera the lens are less than great (with the exception of the Zeiss 24mm) and the color rendition, and general look of the images,  never impressed me.  There are other little things that bugged me quite a bit, like the non-standard hot shoe, the menus system and control layout I kept forgetting.  In general too much like a walkman and not enough like a real camera.Enter the X-E1.  I looked at the reviews of Mike Kobal and others for weeks wondering if I should really trade my Nex in for what on paper appears to be rather similar cameras. I finally took the plunge, keeping for now my Nex 7 should I wish to go back.Well, after a week I am quite happy and can't imagine returning this little gem.  The auto focus is not bad at all, although I wish the focus spot was tighter. The start-up time and shutter leg are quite short. While the camera body seemed rather light, taking it out of the box, once with the lens attached it felt just right.  The view finder is as nice as the Sony (yes maybe a bit of lag in dark scenes but it doesn't bug me).The things I really like over the Nex 7: The shutter sounds much nicer.  This may seem unimportant or superficial but the shutter has such a sweet precision sound it just makes photo taking a pleasure. I think its shutter sound is closer to my Leica MP than the Leica M9 is. The controls also feel much nicer, especially the off-on switch; the Sony feels very cheap and always worries me about its longevity. I'm also finding that my Leica lenses work much better than they did on my Nex 7. My Voightlander 21mm f4 appears to have no chromatic aberration like it did on the Nex 7. Can't forget the Fuji lenses, I only have the so called kit zoom, which is very solid and way better than the sony e kit zoom,  I'm really looking forward to getting more Fuji lenses: 14mm, maybe the 23mm or 27mm.All in all I am very impressed with the progress Fuji has made from the original X100.  This camera is very close to perfect.  Things that need improvement, sure: better video (manual) controls, a few firmware improvements everyone is talking but otherwise it just feels right and I'm really enjoying taking photos.Update: Well, after two weeks I can tell you I'm ready to sell my Nex 7.  This camera is a keeper.  I've figured out how to reduce the size of the focus square, and learned one can keep the camera in manual focus mode and use the AF button to quickly auto focus; this is great for shooting multiple compositions from the same spot. I wish there was a way to quickly adjust the flash but otherwise I find the controls pretty much ideal.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Stills", "Author": "Kenneth J.

I purchased a Fuji X100 last year, and intrigued by the fantastic picture quality of the X100, I started to look at the XE-1.  Almost hit the button on the XE-1, but I really didn't need another camera, and the price at the time was high. I came across a steal for a Nikon V1 with the 10-30 for $250 refurbed. I liked the camera, fast auto focus etc., but the pics didn't hold a candle to the Fuji X100. Last week Fuji announced the XE-2, I immediately saw the price drop on used ones.  Picked up an XE-1 with the 18-55 zoom, and have been blown away by the pics.  A head to head comparison at full resolution with my D600 and 16-35 this week showed the pictures shot with the XE-1 to be sharper and slightly more detailed.  Granted it was only an afternoon of fall foliage shooting, but in several different locations, it showed the Fuji files (jpeg)better.

Aperture noise when switching from playback to shooting.  Noticeable click click click click. Meaning every time you switch back from playback the aperture will adjust from f16 to f1.4, quickly but loudly.2. Oled 2.4M Evf suppose to be same (they purchased the evfs from Sony) as Sony's Nex-7, A77, A65 or Nex external. Compared with my A77, Nex external, and nex-7 the X-e1 has a flickering issue when holding down the shutter release. Only noticeable when pointing the camera at bright human lighting at night, 1.4 aperture. My Sony cameras does not have such issue.3. When you lock exposure value through AEL button you are also locked out of making f-stop or shutter speed changes. I never had a single camera that does that.These are minor issues, no deal breakers for me. 4 stars because I have a soft spot for Fuji and everything else about the X-e1 is just what I wanted. Mainly the manual dials, built quality, jpeg colors, and size.update: The first issue I mentioned can be fixed by updating the lens and body to a new firmware available through Fuji website.update: Went shooting today and got a chance to play with my friend's all black X-e1.

The build, manual controls, the quality of the optics, reminds you of the craft of \"making\" photos and not simply shooting them. All of your creative controls are open to you in the form of dials and switches and not hidden away. This camera helps you translate what you see into images that capture how you feel.Features -The EVF is wonderful to frame up your composition much like they way you learned to shoot photographs.  You see the entire frame at 100% and have the ability to quickly dial in exposure compensation and see all of the relevant information like shutter speed, aperture, and ISO at a glance.The quick menu system is accessible right at the moment need with the \"Q\" button.  The drive, AF, and AE buttons make adjustments and locking quick and does not disrupt your creative flow.  The aperture dial on the lens, and the shutter speed dial on the body is exactly where they should be, the way cameras were made years ago.The film simulation from Fuji simulates the Fujifilm grades from years past.  This is something I only discovered with the camera on hand.  It is every accurate and the images have a Fuji film quality unlike anything I've seen from other digital cameras.  Even at ISOs up to 3600, the images are outstanding.  Their use of a sensor technology that forgoes artificial smoothing keeps images naturally sharp. Modern technology meets old world imagery.Comparisons -This is not the fastest focusing camera as others have pointed out, but I wouldn't say it is the slowest.  It's not built for sports photography or even children.  It`s accurate for more deliberate shooting.I've tried and returned three cameras prior to finding this gem.The Samsung NX1000 takes beautiful pictures and high quality detail at half the price.  It is a great camera, but does not have an EVF.  The focusing is no better than the Fuji.  It lacks craftsmanship and build.  It connects you to the social networks and your tablet instead of connecting you with your subjects.  If cost is a considerable factor, this camera does not disappoint.The Sony NEX 5r is a fast focusing camera with an articulating screen.  Image quality on the kit lens is subpar.  I've heard good things about the available Zeiss lens (24mm) but factoring in the cost, you might was well spend a bit more for the Fuji for the better selection of Fujinon lenses.  The menu system was more like an operating system on a computer.  Having to jump through a complex set of menus and sub-menus distracts from your creative flow.  It lacks the purity of what a camera should be.Samsung NX20 has the articulating screen, but also the handling of a regular DSLR.  Focusing is slow and my copy locked up on me several times writing and therefore loosing my images.  Aside from the defect, the camera is large and missed the point of the compactness of a mirrorless camera.

All good photogs know that great shots do not wait for you to run home and get your camera, so you need to carry one all the time.  Not exactly practical with my big, heavy Canon SLR, so I thought I would give this Fuji a try after reading so many positive reviews.Bottom line is that I am very pleased overall.  The image quality is superb, the colors out of the camera are great, and exposures are surprisingly good even in difficult lighting situations.  The two areas that I am a bit disappointed in is the speed and, especially, focusing.  Shot to shot when shooting raw is pretty slow, which is really surprising because it has a burst mode that will fire off at 6 fps, so do not understand why single shots take about a second each.  Focus speed has improved with the latest firmware, but it seems to be pretty finicky and I get more out of focus shots than I would expect.Having said all that, there are tons of things to like about this camera, including the size, the super build quality, the manual controls, and the value for the money.  Highly recommended for serious photographers!Update on the shot-to-shot issue: turns out that if you turn off auto preview it will shoot as fast as you can press the shutter button.

I purchased the Olympus EP-3 and later the OM-D.  The pictures were very good and the size was perfect, but I could never connect with them due to their user interface which required too time in the menus and too often the cameras were in odd modes that took time to back out of. So I moved to the Fuji.  This one's a keeper.  If you are a photographer who wants to move to something smaller than a DSLR and understands/enjoys the camera controls than I doubt you can do much better short of going to a full-frame Leica M.- The User Interface is very good.  I'm not referring to the styling, but that there are labeled manual controls for commonly used functions.  F-Stop, Aperture, Exposure etc.- The images are excellent- It's much smaller than a DSLR.  It's not noticeable when carried all day, and I love that my entire kit with 4 lenses and accessories takes a very small but.  Note it's not a pocket camera.This camera is not for:- action. IMHO that requires a DSLR- a very compact / pocket camera- complex flash photography.My issue with most cameras is that for me, the camera operation should be very intuitive.  I shouldn't have to think about how to use the camera.  My Sony A700 was perfect in this regards, but the Olympus EP-3 and OM-D were far from it.  I always had to stop and think about how to do something, or finding the camera in some odd mode accidentally.After a month with the Fuji X it's been a joy for still photography of primarily portraits.----------------I find the high points of the Fuji:- The settings that I use multiple times per day couldn't be more intuitive are accessible. A dedicated aperture ring on the lens, dedicated shutter dial, dedicated exposure compensation dial, focus and zoom on the lens, dedicated AEL/AFL.  I don't think there's a camera with better controls for these functions.- The EVF is excellent.- The sensor and image quality are all excellent in all regards.  The dynamic range, noise, resolution are all very good.  I'm very impressed by the dynamic range and how much headroom there is in the RAW files to pull shadows and highlights while preserving colors and image quality.  The noise profiles are very nice.  There's isn't much noise, and it's easily managed in Light Room.  It's the first time that I'd consider ISO 3200 to be acceptable.- The exposure is very good.  Spot, average and matrix are available.  I only use matrix.  I would appreciate center weighted.- The white balance is very good.  Artificial light can be an issue.  I've yet to find a camera that did this well.- Focus peaking was added with the latest firmware.  It works, but the highlight color is white and the edges don't stand out very well.  Consequently I don't find that I use it- I have the 23/2.0, 35/1.4 and 18-55 zoo.  They are all excellent.- it's nice to have the built in flash which can be tilted up for a slight bounce, or more important for remote triggering when Fuji releases appropriate flashes.- There's a great Q button that provides access to a quick menu of photo settings such as ISO and such.- Side Note: I bought the Metal Quick Release Plate, [...] and it's excellent.  It improves handling, and I can use my quick release ball-head.  Battery is also accessible.- Side Note: I purchased an Fotodiox Lens Mount Adapter, [...] for Minolta A-Mount lenses, primarily to use with Peleng 8mm.  Fun----------------Items that I'm neutral on:- Focus speed is fine.  Really.  It's not fine for moving subjects, but I've yet to find a contrast detection camera that can handle moving subjects well.  It's not an action camera though--if you want that look to the higher end DSLRs.  Focus doesn't face detection, but I've never found this reliable in the Olympus line and never used it.  Focus options are spot and general.----------------Items that I don't use or use very rarely:- Movies- Camera film style modes, Panoramas, HDR, etc.  I only shoot RAW so none of these are relevant to me.----------------Items that could be improved, but generally are minor points:- The focus point selection has improved with the newest release.  It's still a two step process.  First select the down arrow on the 4 way controller and than change the focus spot.  Alternatively, the F1 function button can be assigned to set focus mode and than allow setting the focus point with the 4 way controller.I use the F1 button.  When the enable focus point function is set to the down arrow on the controller than the up arrow on the controller is set to macro mode -- a mode that slows focusing considerably.IMHO, a better design is not to have a focus mode, but instead a dedicated the four way controller and center button to only focus point selection during shooting. The four way arrow moves the focus point, and the center button re-centers the focus point. The Menu/OK button should be else where--perhaps the current AF button location.  Better still, is a small joystick instead of the four way controller.  The Sony a700 was perfect in this regard.- It would be nice if there was a center focus.  This is handy if someone else is using the camera who isn't familiar with the controls.  However for this to be useful, the Saved Presets function needs expansion (see item below)- The flash support is lacking overall with the fuji line.  There's only one under powered flash that can support remote wireless off camera.  There is no support for RF based wireless.  There is no support for high speed flash. Perhaps over time this will improve. But if you need flash this isn't it.- Saved Presets is very accessible via the Q button to but only saves photo settings and not camera settings.  So for example, it doesn't save the setting for the AEL button which can be toggle or momentary.  I'd prefer a memory setting that was very comprehensive.  It would also be nice to be able to name the preset.- In the Q menu, the current Saved Preset that is in use should be displayed. Once set (to \"C1\" for example), the Q menu will still display \"Basic\".- Taking photographs in continuous mode is odd.  The camera stores the pictures in the series in a special folder and require special navigation.  I simply don't use continuous mode.  If that's important to you than reviewing the photos in the camera will be odd.  In Light Room you will never notice anything.  Due to this, I only use Still Image and almost never use the Drive button.- I wish there was a dedicated DOF button.  It can be assigned to the F1 button, but due to the issues noted above, I have the F1 button assigned to focus point.- There is no way to set a minimum shutter speed.  This limits the usefulness of the Auto ISO feature.  The newer Fuji cameras have this so perhaps it will be added in a future firmware release.- I wish there was a mode that let me leave the EVF on with eye detection, but the back screen generally off.  The back panel would only turn on for reviewing photos or when setting functions.  This would help considerably with battery life.  The X-E2 is improved over the X-E1 in this regard, in that the EVF only turns on with eye detection, but the back panel doesn't seem to turn on when back buttons are used- the live histogram disappears when the shutter is half way depressed, right when I'm most interested.- The RAW support from Lightroom is acceptable, but other raw processors sometimes have an edge.  It's a small enough issue that I still use LR.- The body and lens' aren't weather sealed.- I found the articulated screen on the OMD to be useful when taking very low shots.----------------Items that are issues for me:- The exposure compensation dial is frequently moved accidentally. It needs to be checked prior to every shot.- in manual mode the live histogram does not reflect the camera settings its not terribly useful. I view this as a bug- in manual mode, the exposure compensation dial has no function it should.  There are two cases where this is important.  (1) with auto ISO in manual mode, the exposure compensation would impact the auto selected ISO (2) in manual mode, the exposure compensation would impact the live histogram.- Image Stabilization is in a the zoom lens' and not the primes.  I've long since grown to love in-body stabilization and this is the first camera that I've had since 2004 that didn't have in-body stabilization.  I miss it.- Battery life is a common complain and I have to agree.  It runs out very quickly.  An hour or two of use and a new battery is needed. Also of an issue is that once it's down to 2 bars (out of 3) it's time to change the battery.  It's not 66% full---more like 10%.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "A photographer's Camera !

Having done lots of research I wanted to get into the Fujifilm mirrorless system but I didn't want to spend lots of money until I felt I could learn to use it. The X-E1 was great due to its price at the moment, allowing me to learn the system. Sure it's AF speed isn't like a DSLR, and for me it's got different usage since I won't be using it for sports, but as a kit it's a fantastic walkabout camera. It's light, fun, it even looks nice! The manual controls and dials are great to use. It feels solid. Fujifilm have great customer service, they continually update the cameras with firmware updates. This is by far a different camera since it was launched. The RAW files are great and the JPEGS are so good you may not even want to or need to post-process. Fuji's film simulations are built in, so if you want those classic film looks, it's great. Sure it doesn't have all features of the recent Fuji's like the X-E2 and the amazing X-T1, but if you don't need all those features or don't want to spend the money this baby is it. Later if you really like the system you can upgrade since you already have the amazing \"kit\" lens although. (It's way better than any other kit lens you get with other brands).

Life and kids has regulated me to digital cameras of the point and shoot variety until now. I did tons of research online, consulted with several Photography types, and came up with the FujiFilm X series. I settled on the X-E1 over the X-M1 for the viewfinder and not the X-Pro1 due to size and cost. This camera is the most pleasant to operate of any camera I have seen since cameras went digital. You want to set Aperture? Roll the ring on the lens, just like you did with a film camera. Shutter speed? Dial on top again like a film camera. There are no 'Mode' dials anywhere to be found, on 'Sports, Mountain, Birthday cake settings' . just plain simple controls. If you want the shutter speed to be automatic, set it to A, same with Aperture. If you want more, there are tons of options in the menu system, but most photo enthusiasts will just ignore these. The image sensor is fantastic, providing image quality on par with the very best DSLR's out there, even full frame. Within 30 minutes of owning the X-E1, I took the best pictures I ever have, and even more important my wife was able to reproduce the same results. A lot of this was also due to the 35mm f1.4 lens, but the simplicity of the camera and it's high quality sensor round out the picture. The build quality is top notch, with all the dials and buttons having great feel and positive feedback. The owners manual is a bit small so I downloaded the .pdf from Fuji's web site and loaded it into iBooks, now I just read it on the iPad, so size problem solved.

With a inexpensive (17 usd) adaptor I use all my vintage Minolta lenses from the 60s & 70s. Prior to owning this camera I was adapting my lenses to a Sony nex 5n. Both sensors are 1.5 crop factor, both at 16mp. In comparing the 2 the image quality from fuji's x trans sensor is much sharper, has more accurate color & wider dynamic range.  In post processing is where you really see the difference. For example, in light room you can push the clarity or shadows slider all the way with very little noise introduced. Even at iso 3200. In fact any noise from high iso appears random like subtle film grain. The nex is a great camera but has a very un natural bit mapped noise when pushed to this extreme.  In comparison to the image quality I got from my Minoltas on the Nex the Fuji X E1 is MUCH sharper, it really does look like it came out of my SRT 101 film camera. I also love that this is a camera that respects the tradition of photography. I admire the simplicity of its design & how straight ahead it is. The shutter speed dial is so much more useful than those ridiculous mode dials. The menu system is also very well designed & can be used quite well in the evf without the need of using the back lcd. In comparison Sony had so many \"features\" (do we really need smile recognition?) I would get lost searching for simple functions such as card formatting. The Nex handbook actually calls Depth of Field \"Blurry Background\", call me old fashioned, but why the need to dumb it down? The X E1 feels looks like a film camera & shoots like a film camera. The EVF has superb image quality, it does lag a bit with motion & camera shake but it makes up for it with its brightness & clarity.  Unlike other viewfinders that are %100 live view & reflect changes in exposure the XE1 EVF is always brightly at optimum exposure regardless of light meter reading. (It does reflect depth of field live view) This is wonderful for shooting in low light & it helps one to concentrate on getting the best exposure from the camera & leaving the development for post production.

The colors, the richness -- well, you won't be disappointed.  Back in 2001 I started shooting with a Fuji dSLR - the Finepix S1Pro, and then I graduated tot he Finepix S2Pro.  The colors from those cameras were incredible!  This little gem exceeds that.  I would like to add that I am near-sighted and wear glasses.

It's a bit bigger than Micro 4/3 cameras although it's pretty light. It's not \"weather sealed\" but it seems rugged enough for me. I really enjoy taking pictures with it, and although such things are unimportant in the grand scheme of things the fact that it makes a satisfying but relatively quiet shutter sound doesn't hurt.Why not five stars?First of all, the EVF, although it provides a super-clear image that makes manual focusing possible without any kind of focus peaking, is pretty slow. When other reviewers say you won't be using it to shoot sports, they mean it.Second, the auto-focus is slow. It's fast enough for me most of the time, but my old Panasonic GF1 seems snappier and the OM-D blows this camera away.

It's fun to use.  A great deal has been said about those attributes and I don't need to amplify.  I've had some problems, however.First, I have returned two cameras to the local camera store where I made my purchase.  I returned the first one because its LCD screen and/or electronic viewfinder would randomly shut down.  I just returned the second one after artifacts began showing up in some of my images.  I had to wait about two weeks for the first replacement, and I've been told it could be three weeks before I receive the next one.  I will give up on the camera if I have trouble with the third one.Finally, much has been said about the autofocus.  I don't take action photography, or even much that moves, so the slow autofocus wasn't an issue for me.  Nevertheless, I've lost a surprisingly large number of shots of static subjects because they were out of focus, despite having received the green box and beep telling me focus was good.  I've updated the firmware for both the camera and my 18-55 mm kit lens.  I take a lot of shots of high-contrast subjects, and I think this is the problem; in my experience thus far the autofocus has a hard time with high contrast situations.  Having said that, however, manual focus through the EVF is wonderfully easy with the feature that greatly magnifies a portion of the subject.Focus peaking and an articulated LCD would be really nice, but I'm not complaining about  the lack of features I knew the camera didn't have when I decided to buy it.So I'm hoping third time's a charm, because this is a camera I really want to keep.Update, 1/27/13:  I've had my third camera for a few weeks.  I still love it and am going to keep it, but it appears that there's a sensor problem under specific lighting conditions.  I've just discovered artifacts, i.e., smudges, with this third camera in photos taken into fog or mist with partial sun shining through.  I had the exact same problem with my second camera under the exact same conditions, and it was the reason I returned that camera.  It's happened consistently under these conditions, in probably 100 shots.  My guess is that the lighting somehow confuses the sensor without the anti-aliasing filter.  The good news is that the artifacts are pretty easy to remove with software in the way one would remove dust smudges.So the camera isn't perfect, but I sure have grown attached to it.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "A might midget !", "Author": "Byron Law Yone MD", "ReviewID": "R1C110Q0EP60H7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "An amazing little camera.Image quality and the color rendition is outstanding and so much more easy to travel with.

My 3 stars is the result of a very subjective review but still wanted to note it as there may be some others like me here. I have been using different Canon DSLRs over the last 9 years. I have upgraded to Canon 5D Mark II couple years ago and I could not be happier. I however strongly needed a back-up camera as I am traveling quite a lot and my Canon has almost died on me while in Southern China. That is when I made up my mind about a second camera that I would use as a back-up and I knew it could not be a camera coming from a low price range after being used to 5D. I picked the X-E1 as a result of the great reviews, compact size, stylish design and the quality of the photos that it produces in addition to the lens selection that Fuji already had available. I however missed one thing - after all those years with DSLR - I could no longer use the EVF. I was not aware how important the optical view finder was for me until I got the X-E1. It is like watching a movie while trying to shoot. On top of that, the LCD is not always a side option as it gets extremely effected by the light and there had been circumstances when I was shooting blind because of how bright the LCD got. I had to sell this camera in about two months after I bought it and I may now go for the more expensive version - Pro 1 as it has an optical viewfinder, a feature that I now know is crucial for me.

But for me, the EVF is subpar for its price, and problematic enough for me to return this camera.Panning the camera while watching the EVF reveals how poorly it refreshes.  This is really problematic for me old eyes.  I was not able to focus manually (Voigtlander 50mm f/1.1 mounted via Metabones M-X adapter) while magnifying because the subject appears to be madly hopping around.  The subject does not remain still due to EVF flickering.  This problem does not occur with NEX7.Update:  I've decided to keep the camera because IQ is that much better than NEX7 and even Nikon D700 at ISO 6400, despite the overall slow operation.  I've upgraded to 4 stars from three because of the great IQ offsetting other subpar performances.Update2: After taking photos in real situations, namely indoors with normal to dim lighting, I've given up on this camera.  The AF is just horrible.  More than 50% of pictures were out of focus (not even close).  It just can't seem to focus on the subjects, namely people. What a shame.  My Sony RX100 focuses much faster and spot on.  This camera reminds of Sigma DP2 (not Merrill) in the auto focusing department.  This camera is not practical for indoor use.

Shaffer", "ReviewID": "R3IHW57AUIA88N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been playing with both these cameras for the past few weeks with the intent of choosing one as an alternate to my DSLR rigs and main travel camera. I've never been happy with the compromise in image quality you would have to make with compact cameras, so up to this point I've been 'that guy' toting around my 5DmkIII on family outings. I even bought the (amazingly sharp) 40mm pancake lens to make my rig more compact but it's still far from being as small as either of these two cameras.Build QualityWhile both these cameras have a very high end build quality rarely seen these days, the Sony is clearly a step above the with Fuji with its metal lens cap and overall solid construction that makes it feel as if it was machined from a single piece of metal.DesignHere's where I give the Fuji the edge as it most closely captures the feel of my beloved Contax G2. I prefer Fuji's choice of  separate aperture and shutter speed selection dials with the 'A' setting verses Sony's PASM. Call me old school but I really like looking down and seeing the shutter speed with a glance of a dial instead looking at the LCD screen. But one of the biggest nods in the Fuji's favor is the inclusion of a viewfinder - while I'm still not thrilled with the performance of the EVF, it's worlds better than no EVF at all. I really think Sony should have put a viewfinder on the RX-1, I understand they were pushing the envelope on just how small you can make a full frame camera - but I think the slight increase in size to put a viewfinder on the camera would have still resulted in compact design but  it would have made such a big improvement in the way you interact with the camera. I also think it would have resulted in a body size that would be much more proportionally balanced with the lens. I personally don't like thePerformanceMuch has been said on the web on how slow these cameras are in AF in low light, I found neither one unacceptable and much better than I could have done manually. I found AF tracking of moving subjects poor on both cameras that may be disappointing to those who enjoy shooting active subjects.With well lit subjects, I found both cameras equally snappy in their ability lock focus. General menu navigation and image review and zooming did appear to be slightly better with the Sony but overall, I'd call this one a tie. Image QualityIt all comes down to this right? What good is all the handling, ergonomics and compact size advantages if you don't end up with images that make you happy. Neither camera disappoints in this area, both produce beautiful and have low light capabilities that until now was unseen in the compact segment. But the adv pantage goes to Sony with it's extra Megapixels and that beautiful Zeiss lens that can really resolve some amazing detail and can go along way in making up for its fixed 35mm lens with some post processing cropping.My comparisons may be a bit unfair since the Fuji had a zoom lens vs. a prime but the Sony was giving my 5DmkIII a run for its money so I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb to say that swapping out the zoom would have reversed my opinion.ConclusionWhile Steve Huff(stevehuffphoto.com) did the same comparison and chose the RX-1 as his personal choice. I came to the opposite conclusion, for me, the Fuji's controls, design of operation and VIEWFINDER won me over. It may be totally superficial but I felt as though I was more 'in touch' with the photographic process with the Fuji. It felt more like a tool in my hand for me to craft my art instead of the latest wiz-bang  gadget and that was significant enough for me to overlook the IQ advantage of the Sony. Some may find the price difference alone enough reason to choose the Fuji but I find that the hurt in the wallet is only temporary, but the sting of dealing with a camera you don't enjoy is much longer lasting. In fact, if Sony would have released the RX-1 with a viewfinder and better controls, I would have no hesitation in paying the asking price.

In the very beginning, I would always get Nikon point and shoots, and when I got serious about photography, got into their DSLRs. One day, I decided it was time for an upgrade, so I took a risk and went with Fujifilm. (The risk being switching from a brand I am familiar with to a new and different brand).Coming straight of the box this is a beautiful camera. It has the feel of the older film cameras, combined with the modern touch of a present day DSLR. If you are like me, coming from a more common mirror system DSLR you may have some trouble getting around it at first. The camera sits comfortably in my hands, but it isn't as thick or heavy as the D3200. Once you take it outside and play a bit though that passes quickly. The controls are a bit different as well. For shutter speed, the dial at top is set to a number, then the directional buttons are pressed left or right to go up one to two levels or down one or two levels. More then that you have to twist the dial to the next speed. Aperture is controlled on the lens itself, which was new to me, but highly welcomed. It made handling the camera a lot easier.Instead of holding down buttons or finding switches like I was use to, I could now just twist the aperture ring and adjust it must faster and smoother.The different modes are easy to get to and understand, panoramas are fluid and simple to take and come together most times flawlessly. If you move or shake the camera too much there may be some distortions, but even these are minimal. The three photo sets used mainly for HDR photography are effective if you have a tripod.One feature that is very useful, and has made my work increasingly easier, is the responsive screen and viewfinder. Both of which eliminate the guess work from changing your settings. The image in the viewfinder or LCD screen is just as bright and in focus as the image you are about to capture. If the view in the LCD has perfect lighting, when you press the shutter the photo that comes out of it will be exactly the same. I do commercial photography of vehicles, and with changing sunlight, going from inside and outside, near the window and away from it, this feature saves me a lot of work. No more being two clicks too dark or bright.The only feature that needs to be improved, as song have said before is the autofocus. On the basic level it works well, but there are some points when it is lacking. Inside a vehicle, well shooting the console or steering wheel features, it will have issues with focusing just right, even with macro mode engaged, where as my D3200 didn't. But it is not enough to deter me from using it full time, nor should it deter you from buying this camera.There are other features it has that are useful, but small and not really enough to make or break a deal. Such as the level tool, that places a straight line across the screen, and another showing you how off level the camera is. Useful but not something required. Overall I would recommend the X-E1.

This camera fits my hands nicely.  I recently updated the firmware to 2.1, and the auto iso is much improved.  The lenses I have for it are the XC 16-50, the XF 27mm, and two Russian Industar lenses mounted with adapters.  I think the X-E1 strikes a nice balance of modern and traditional elements of photography.  I think that unless you absolutely have to have the fastest, the latest and the greatest, you might save your money and buy the X-E1 instead of the new X-E2.  Keep the money in your pocket, or buy a new lens.Criticisms- Fuji's fit and finish, while very nice in general, occasionally is lacking...for instance the seam that runs along the bottom of the X-E1, separating front from back; a very poor fit, making the camera look flimsy and cheap when it really isn't. Also, the metal on the top does not feel as solid as it does on the X10 or XPRO1 but it is still very nice.  These things really don't bother me at all after owning the camera for some time, just something that you might notice at first. (apparently this is a quality control issue, as I purchased a second X-E1 and it does not have the seam problem.)And the black rubber around the EVF does not do a very good job of excluding extraneous light, and there is no means of attaching a more effective eye cup.I found out quickly that the finish rubs off quite easily.

However, I was surprised at just how slow it really is, even after installing the latest firmware updates for both the body and the lens. I also had a number of focus misses, even though the camera appeared to lock on. In lower lighting levels, the lens would often hunt back and forth before achieving focus.Nearly every time I picked up the camera, I found that the power switch was on despite shutting off the camera beforehand. Very minimal pressure is required to move it from the off to on state, and just the act of putting the camera into a bag is enough to turn it back on. I've never had a digital camera that was so difficult to turn off, and keep off.The final straw occurred earlier today when I took a photo of an old red brick mill building. There were odd wide wavy bands of yellowish color running throughout the brick. I have not seen these wavy bands in any other photos shot with the camera, so I'm wondering if there was something about the brick pattern may have triggered the false colors.I really loved the weight, size, and feel of the camera body, but with the poor performance and other quirks it was easy for me to decide to return this camera and lens.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera, perfect size, excellent image quality, SLOW focus which makes it useless for me...", "Author": "Jay Tunkel \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R16AU00I4JI6WU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great landscape camera.

I really wanted to like it and use it, but it didn't make sense for what I do. It may be good for you.I compared it to a D800... the XE1 performs remarkably well in comparison.. especially at high ISO settings its amazing that such a small camera can deliver such great images. So from a pure image quality standpoint, it's a huge win for Fuji to be able to deliver top notch image quality from a much smaller package. The pros and cons are always weighted differently for any user..Pros:1. Image quality, perfect2. White balance and exposure, excellent.3. JPG quality terrific.4. Lightweight5. Allows you to blend in to the crowd... though these days everyone seems to have a DSLR.Cons:1. Not at all pocketable unless you've got some huge pockets. (Wouldn't fit in my coat pocket either).2. Slow autofocus.. I thought this was people just being picky... but basically, indoors it is not possible to focus on moving objects/kids. The camera needs certain contrasts in order to lock focus and for some reason it has a difficult time with faces... stupid.3. Reviewing photos is too slow. If you're shooting jpg+raw, fire off a few shots, it can be literally 20-30 seconds before you can review.4. Continuous shooting is poorly implemented... when on 3 frames per second, I dare you to shoot 1 frame only. It's almost impossible. On my D800 its very natural.5. Workflow.. the RAW files are still poorly read by Lightroom and for some reason, they show a LOT more noise than the jpeg even though I had noise reduction turned off. Anyway, the problem with jpg is that they are not always perfect.. but in general they are better than the raws... but the only reliable way to convert the raw is some other editor or in camera. Basically this camera throws my whole workflow off.. I could develop a new workflow, but the problem is that this camera cannot replace my D800 because of how slow it is. Even if I kept the XE1 for special uses, I'd still need to shoot my D800.. having 2 different workflows is a pain.6. Laggy viewfinder... I assume this is because the viewfinder needs to gather more light in low light and it does this by adjusting shutter speed of live view capture.. but it goes down to like probably 8 fps, just way too laggy in dimmer indoor lighting. Doesn't even have to be that dark. It's no good having great ISO potential if you can't see through the viewfinder easily.I could go on but ultimately, it just didn't live up to what I want. However, I can tell that in 1 or 2 more generations, this breed of camera may very well change the entire market. If the viewfinder was real time even in the dark and if autofocus was much faster, I might totally switch.. but for now, I can't justify keeping this camera only to use when I am ok with carrying a camera (instead of pocketing my RX100) in bright light or only for relatively still objects in low light.

Very little to no noise at ISOs as high as 6400!+Integrated flash, I really like this little flash, it is powerful enough to provide decent light in a room, and it can be bounced off the ceiling for a more natural look+Camera options/ergonomics, I found the menu options intuitive and ergonomics nice on the X-E1, once you play with the camera for a few days it is really easy to get to the option you want and do what you want to do with the camera, I really like the button-ology of this camera.There are other really great things about this camera that I'm sure you have already read about in other reviews, the items above are the ones that really stood out for me. Now for the bad part, and really, the reasons that made me send this camera back and realize that I just could not justify keeping this Fujifim toy...-Auto-focus is horrendous. For this reason alone I will send the camera packing. I know that there are many who complain about the AF, but I figured that it could not be that bad. Well, it is! I even made sure that I had the latest firmware that was supposed to improve the AF, but it did not do much of anything to it. Even in good light the focus kept on hunting to find its spot and give me the green box, which seemed like it was forever. This cannot be normal in a camera of at this price range in this day and age. Fujifilm needs to take a serious look at this.-Build-quality is not as I expected. The camera is a good looking camera, it does have that Leica-sort-of-feel, but not really. To me it felt a bit too flimsy. It is light, but perhaps (too light?) the top of the camera is made from magnesium alloy, but the rest is plastic, or feels very plastic-y and cheap. Also, I think it is a bit too big for a mirrorless option. With the kit lens this camera is almost as big/bulky as a small DSLR.-No weather sealing. Would be nice for this camera to have at least SOME weather sealing.-Lack of good lenses selection. This is a relatively new system, and though you can get an adapter to put many different kinds of lenses (including some awesome Leica ones) there is a very limited amount of native lenses available for the X mount/system. I found the kit lens to be excellent though!Why do I think that the OM-D is better?-the OM-D's focus system is light years ahead of this Fujifilm camera, fast and accurate, even in low light.-images from the the OM-D look more contrasty, sharper, and with more detail. Image quality from the X-E1 seems a bit soft and washed out when compared to images from the OM-D. The X-E1 does have better IQ in low light, but with the horrible focus system it is irrelevant unless you are only taking pictures of static subjects for which you have plenty of time to focus.-OM-D feels more solid, though the Fujifilm camera has better ergonomics, still the OM-D feels like a more durable camera with great built and awesome weather-sealing. The OMD is smaller and a better looking piece of hardware!-Lens selection for the 4 micro 3rds is outstanding, much better than what is available for Fuji's X-mount-Many say that the IQ from the Fujifilm is much better, but I did side-by-side comparisons and did not find the images from the Fujifilm to be better than the OMD, other than in controlled low light situations, and even then, the difference is not major.-the EVF on the OMD is more responsive and feels better cupped up to the eye.-The touch screen on the OMD is great for selective focus, and it can be flipped up or down for perspective shots-The OMD is much more customizable-Overall the OMD is a more responsive and agile camera, capable of producing shots just as good if not better than any camera with an APS-C sensor.I was curious about this camera, really curious, and now that I got to scratch the itch, I am not very impressed and glad to keep my OM-D.

So far i have only shot jpeg, but the image quality is very impressive coming out from such a \"small\" camera.  The color output is very very nice for portrait photos, and the images have VERY little noise.  Now i completely understand why Fuji doesn't bother with all that 24MP marketing gimmick going on.  Although i know Fuji will eventually put 24MP sensors in their future cameras, this 16MP is already AMAZING plus it will save my PC's hard drive space.When i saw some of the jpeg images on my monitor i thought i was shooting with a 24MP camera or something, then i realized how good this camera is.  I have no desire for a 24MP camera whatsoever and what this camera outputs is PLENTY for me.  Fuji's cameras are so much FUN to use, that's why i sold all my Nikon stuff and jumped to Fuji all the way.What i know is that i am going to be BLOWNED away when i start shooting RAW with this camera.I only give it 4 stars because it does have AF limitations, even after the firmware update, as everyone already know.  This cameras are not for TRACKING fast moving things, but i have taken photos of my kids running around with the XE1 without problem.  People confuse focusing with tracking and many folks always say \"you can't shoot FAST action, you CAN'T shoot fast action!\".  Focusing and tracking are two completely different things.  It is NOT impossible to take photos of fast moving kids, you just have to know where to stand and when to shoot.  I know because i have done it myself.In (very) dimmed light the focusing will hunt just a bit in Single Focus point, but there are many tips on how to work around this situations, one is shoot in Continues AF and the camera works pretty darn good.  Also some have said to enlarge the AF point just a bit to improve AF lock.I bought this camera at the $719 sale price with the 18-55 lens and i am EXTREMELY happy with this gorgeous piece of machine.

Please don't thumbs down because you disagree.  This is a valid review with many accurate points.  A number of these issues have been addressed in the X-E2 including moving the Q button.  I'm beginning to think that Fuji X users just can't take any criticism of their beloved gear.  Fuji has made repeated missteps in the X-series bodies and is learning from their mistakes over time.  The X-T1 is a solid camera, AFTER having ironed out the light leak issues.  New Fuji bodies always have problems.)My background is as former camera salesperson and semi-pro/freelance back in 35mm days with Nikon F2/FM/FE.  I've been a hobbyist through low-end digital Nikons such as D50/D40/D60/D5200, etc.  Been through various Panasonic FZ cameras.  I currently own a Panasonic DMC-G5 M4/3 and Fuji X-E1.As everyone knows, the IQ out of the Xtrans sensor is incredible.  That is, if you can get the camera to perform on automatic, or even shutter priority.  Here is what I have noticed after a few outings:- Panning with this camera, even on shutter priority (for long or slow speeds) results in horribly overexposed (~+5 stops) images.  What you saw in the viewfinder was fine. But when you start shooting with panning things go crazy.  It's like the AE gets confused.  AE-Lock button or full manual is the only hope of getting good images.- Strong sidelighting or backlighting (even at 45 degrees) on this camera results in very underexposed images.  The image looks fine in the viewfinder even with the shutter pressed half way.  But again, similar to the panning example above, the AE gets confused when it actually records the image.  +2 EV dailed up, the most this camera offers, is no help.  In this case full manual is your best hope.The handling of this camera requires alot of menu play.  There are no custom buttons and only a single Fn button up top (fixed in X-E2/X-T1).  If you are not in the right mode and need to switch, you better hope you have 10-30 seconds to dig through menus to find what you want.  The Q(uick) menu is a little cryptic.  The icons are not very intuitive and are scrunched together (not helped by having 2.8\" LCD).  It is also somewhat unnatural to have to press the Q button, then use the rocker toggle, and then reach again over to the mode spinner to change a particular setting.  That's three mode changes/touches that could/should be two at most with good tactile design.I'm also experiencing issues with the power button being too easy to get switched to the opposite position from what you want it at.  The power button should NOT be sticking out from the front of the body, flush or recessed would have been much better  (fixed in X-T1).Because this is a flat/retro body, with a [relatively] over-sized kit lens, you end up having to use your right thumb/palm to try and counter-balance the lens.  This leads to all sorts of bad side effects over encounters with buttons on the back right side of the camera.  These buttons are easily [inadvertently] pressed while just handling the camera.  You end up either being prompted about macro mode if you hit the top rocker accidently, or may find your self in Q mode from pressing that button (fixed in X-E2) with your thumb palm or may find yourself changing the display properties from that button at the bottom.  This is even with a thumb grip in the hotshoe and the overpriced Fuji hand grip that screws into the bottom of the camera.  There are few safe places to hold this body.On a weekend trip into Asheville and the surrounding area I had an interesting 4 minute panic that I'm sure many new X-series owner will experience.  I had just used my camera shooting some street scenes and then had dinner.  When I got up from dinner I noticed the camera was not focusing.  It was stuck on manual focus.  I spent a few minutes going through the Quick menu, looking at the camera, and I just could not remember where the focus mode was set though I had seen it before on the camera.  I then looked around the front of the camera again and realized the rotating switch for focus mode had accidently been switched to M for manual.  This is an example of splitting-off a control that is not apparent or visible to the photographer from looking at it from the two most common directions, from the back or from the top of the camera.  It's another example of a design that perhaps has it's charm, but has annoying aspects that are not immediately intuitive and/or that well thought out.  The camera would benefit greatly from a help button or EVF hints such as the Panasonic DMC-G5 gives you when you have overridden the EV. It depicts the type of tactile motion that you do to switch it back (push in on the rotary dial.)If you have any thoughts of doing street shooting, journalism, parades, let alone sports, you will find yourself running into these issues.  It does make a great IQ, at times, a real frustration.I feel Fuji needs to do yet another firmware update to address these panning and backlighting issues where what you see in the viewfinder (with shutter half pressed down and AE supposedly locked) going way over [panning] or way under [backlight] exposed.For the poor design of menus, there may be no hope.  For the buttons that are too easily pressed, well, there is always the X-T1.(If only Fuji would release their bodies at more reasonable prices.  A great sensor is not worth housing with quirky firmware in a quirky body.)", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Yes, but..", "Author": "John Johnson", "ReviewID": "R38HMITQZQC4PS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fine outdoor performer., not so much  for indoors.

I've upgraded my rating and like the camera very much.  Of course, it's not going to perform like a pro-level DSLR, but it's also much easier to carry and takes excellent images.--------- previous review ------------I am a long time photographer.  As a teenager, I worked at Ehrenreich Photo-Optical Industries (EPOI) and owned numerous film and digital cameras.  My last film cameras were a Mamiya 645, Zenza Bronica and Canon EOS850, and after switching to digital, I've owned a Nikon D70S, Nikon D2XS, Nikon D3S and Nikon D800.I read the write-ups on the Fujifilm X-E1 and was very excited to buy one.  The camera is a good size and feels nice in the hand.  I especially like access to key controls, a feature not available on most point-and-shoot cameras.  I like the \"retro\" look that reminds me of the range finder cameras I used to own.  The Fujifilm does not have an optical viewfinder.  The electronic viewfinder is bright but a little slow when recomposing a shot.  You can also shoot in live view mode, but I prefer the viewfinder.  I would have preferred an optical viewfinder.  A nice X-E1 feature is the automatic switching when you hold the viewfinder up to your eye and the camera senses it.I now keep the Fujifilm with me for unplanned shoots or emergencies.  I have the 18-55mm lens that has a 35mm film equivalent crop-factor similar to a 27-82.5mm lens due to the APS-C sensor size.  That lens offers a fairly good range for most of my shots.I use Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop for processing.  Lightroom doesn't seem to handle the X-E1 files very well yet, and images seem to be slightly distorted.  I'm sure that will be fixed by Adobe very soon (if not already).Overall, I find the X-E1 to be noticeably slower than the high-end Nikons (D3S and D800) that I use most of the time.  Focus is slower and there is some shutter lag.  It's probably unfair to compare the X-E1 to two top-of-the-line DSLRs, but it is a factor to consider since the X-E1 is not a cheep camera.  The X-E1 is faster than my wife's point-and-shoot though.I see more noise at mid to high ISO in the X-E1 than I see in my D800 (the pro-level D3S is known for it's high ISO performance, so it's unfair to compare them).  The X-E1 has an APS-C sensor that is larger than sensors in point-and-shoot cameras, so it is an improvement in image quality, resolution and nose levels over point-and-shoots.  I suspect it's hard to keep noise low with 16.3MP crammed on the APS-C sensor.  Point-and-shoot cameras are also putting a lot of megapixels on even smaller sensors, so they must do in camera processing to reduce noise.  The image quality of the X-E1 is much better than point-and-shoot cameras I've seen.  The Nikon D3S and D800 are full-frame sensors and the X-E1 can't match images from those cameras.The X-E1 just can't compete with high-end or pro level DSLRs, but it's a good camera that takes excellent shots.  The retro-look is cool and I added a leather case that looks like the range finders I had many years ago.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stunning Results - But not a camera for me", "Author": "T.

That speaks to how great the customer service is with amazon.The camera.. love it so far.Quality of the images is quite good, not as great as my D700 but higher that i expected and awesome for a camera this size and weight.JPGs are great too, if you adjust your settings accordingly i find that Velvia when the sun is up is simply stunning).Currently i shoot both raw and jpgs. I hope that Lightroom gets an update with proper support for the Fuji RAW files, cause currently the support sucks and processing the files takes ages. Gets my CPU at 100% and although my Computer has no problems processing files from a 5D mark II or D700, processing the fuji files is super slow.Now that the new X100s is out with the new sensor that has the nifty split-image and focus peaking i do feel kind of cheated by Fuji as both of the cameras where realised almost at the same time and there wont be a firmware update to add the support which is lame. I understand that those features need the new sensor, but releasing/aanouncing a camera 2 months after the release of the XE-1 that has those features is just bad of them. The XE-1  should have had the same features.Either way i guess what i am trying to get to is that if you can wait for the next version you should. Especially if you are planning on shooting with manual focus lenses or just use the manual focus.The lens 18-55 is very nice and sharp i have no complains. It's a great 'kit' lens, much better than the kit lenses you normally get with other cameras. Actually the quality i get of the lens is not of a 'kit' lens, but rather of a more expensive lens.So why a 4 and not a 5? Well the quality control. I had to go through 3 cameras. One had a lot of dust inside the lens, and the second had scratches inside the lens. 3rd time is a charm i guess. Still the new camera had some dust particles but nothing you wont get after a few weeks of everyday use. Still though... it new and should have anything.In general, i think Fuji needs to add some kind of weather sealing on their lenses. So may people talk about how sturdy their lenses feel and that they are of high quality, but when dust creeps in out of nowhere then it's a bit unacceptable given their price. So to give you a comparison, even my cheap 'kit' lenses from cameras that are 3 years old dont have as much dust inside and they are not new and used a lot.Autofocus is kind of sucky too. When it fails, you try and try again, and sometimes it just doesnt focus. That didnt happen very often i managed to get focus most of the time. But there are sometimes that in noooo way its going to focus. Even in simple scenes with plenty of light. Dark scenes, well its like playing roulette :).Some points: - Fuji please add better sealing to your lenses. - Adobe Photoshop/Lightroom support please. - Better autofocus pleaseeeeeeeAnd now for the summary------Buy the camera :).Much better than any MFT i tried so far. The high iso is great. Very portable. Fine quality images. Lightweight. Really fun to use.The back lcd is great even if its not as 'high-res' as other cameras. The viewfinder is great.Although i mention some 'issues' i do not regret my decision. It's a great camera and its worth the investment.I mentioned all the 'gripes' and 'issues' i could find, but it's still an awesome camera. Didn't really like MFT but this is a keeper. Just remember your FF camera is FF (that's what i keep telling myself).I now have a camera i can take everywhere without sacrificing so much of quality. So much fun to use. Tune the jpgs and you'll love the output. :)", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Reality Check", "Author": "RealityCheck", "ReviewID": "RRDW24SANUINY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just a few months after release, Fuji themselves discover problem after problem with the basic AF and low light AF, especially when using the lagging EVF. Fuji had postponed the latest firmware flash 3 times after discovering problem after problem.

Very, VERY few of you will use the X-E1 for still life, bright light, outdoor portrait shots vs everyday normal outdoor and indoor action shots.The X-E1 was released waaay too early in it's technological infancy by Fuji, and even when the firmware updates are released it will not fix the AF and indoor normal action AF problems with the 1.5x sensor.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "it's okay", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R3Q5BZ1LVJ4U3V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just got the camera, played with it for half hour, and realized it's not for me.

I sent them my X Pro1 because the switch to toggle the OVF/EVF occasionally fails. They claim that there was impact damage because there is a scratch/crack on the front of the view finder. This apparently voids the entire warranty of the camera. They gave me this estimate:Estimate Charge ($)  860.26Shipping Charge ($)  18Tax ($)  77.95Total Charges ($)  956.21For a switch issue. Even if the the front glass was damaged due to a \"impact\" (which I do not remember, which is not to say that it didn't happen somewhere), it is in a different part of the camera.The X series take beautiful photos, but you may all want to buy a camera from a vendor that honors their own warranties.Edit: The camera was never dropped, it turns out that the viewfinder cover was pushed out of place, probably due to pressure against it in the camera bag. Also, the viewfinder works perfectly, and I was not asking for it to be fixed. It's the toggle switch that fails, and only in extreme temperatures. Even when the switch fails, the viewfinder works in either OVF or EVF mode.

It really did handle like a point and shoot with a lens on it.
