Man what a fantastic package this camera is. It has a larger touch screen that is super simple to use! I have already taken MANY shots in various conditions and it has NOT dissapointed. And the VIDEO is great. Such a small package but a LARGE value! I am using a 16g SD card and it is perfect for a combination of tons of HQ pics and HD video. Also the microphone does a superb job picking up crisp sounds for playback and a wind-noise-canceler.Buy this camera!!!", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC-FX75S", "Author": "Patricia Mitchell \"Patricia\"", "ReviewID": "R1I42V3UFKV5ME", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am disappointed with this camera. It does not zoom in enough for me. I have to fix EVERY pic I take with it. I love nature pics but cannot see in detail the effects I want. I bought this to replace a different Panasonic Lumix which was much better than this. This cost a lot more, but not worth it to meI just recently noticed it has what looks like dirt spots in the pics. I looked at the lens and do not see it, but it is there when I download the pics to my computer. I am looking into replacing this already", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "What a waste of money.", "Author": "DWH", "ReviewID": "R2J5SWCIWIE47R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera does not have a view finder.
