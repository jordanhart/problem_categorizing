I was drawn to the camera because of the plum color.  The slim size makes it easy to carry and the simplicity of the camera was a must.  The uploading to my computer was easy too. A good choice for a simple no fuss digital camera.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value for our buck", "Author": "APerson", "ReviewID": "R3J6VRX9Y4DFVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera rocks. Not only is it in my favorite color but the picture quality is phenomenal and the options available are perfect for any occasion.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good pictures, cheap camera", "Author": "cedarlili", "ReviewID": "R3840XS1J335IT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The pictures this camera takes are great. Not so good, the plastic housing of the camera is already broken. It's not durable at all, so plan to baby it if you want it to last.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for the money", "Author": "TLL111", "ReviewID": "R2CNICN4VZE13S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the money, this is a basic camera that you can easily lug around. It is nice to have as an option instead of bringing my SLR. It is small and compact but it still produces some good pictures.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for Outdoor Photos", "Author": "sedona1132", "ReviewID": "RVTPXF0KEYEY3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is fair for the price.  I have had this camera for 3 years and taken many photos. It's easy to use. The plastic battery cover broke within the first year, but the camera still works.  Not great for indoor or distance shots, grainy and dark pictures.  When using the flash, it washes out faces.  Videos over 1 minute and 30 seconds tend to get jerky and static with the picture and sound.  Also, the camera doesn't have a speaker so when you play back the video on the camera there is no sound.  You can hear the sound when you down load the video onto your computer and replay it.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "GOOD CAMERA, but-", "Author": "Harleyschoolboy", "ReviewID": "R3J0A6L6M0IDHS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great Camera, easy to operate. Has many features for taking pictures, video, close-ups, action shots, varying light, stich together panoramas. BUT: Too bad that Kodak no longer supports the software.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Kodak EasyShare C182 12 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Purple)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31pXkObMi8L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0049CUFZ0"}}
