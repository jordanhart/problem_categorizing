I started with Panasonics, then moved to Logitech's WiLife system and now I've had the Schlagelink up & running for 2 months.I abandoned the Panasonic because it was way too finicky to keep the weblink going. Constant tinkering & calls to tech support were required (tho their tech support people are tops). Their cams were pretty good with better resolution than the Schlagelink; they also feature pan & tilt, absent on the Schlage.The WiLife looked promising, was simple to set-up & had very good resolution with both indoor & outdoor cams; these added a minimal degree of zoom to the mix. Unfortunately, they are electrically really skittish and any kind of interference knocked them out, sometimes fatally. I had bought 8 cams before I gave up.Now the wireless Schlagelink is a bit coarser image and is essentially fixed, but it has never gone off line and looks stupendous on the iPhone app. Interestingly, while all my other Schlagelink modules (3 door locks, 3 thermostats, 3 light controllers) rely on the wireless bridge included in the starter kit, the camera runs independently of the bridge. Even better, if your wireless goes down for a bit, it will reconnect when the wireless is up again & in a pinch it can even \"borrow\" a neighbor's wireless if available.I'd like to give it 4.5 stars because of the limited resolution & lack of features, but as it fully delivers what it promises, I'm going to go all the way.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "kamiraa", "ReviewID": "R15MXUU6EB2GN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This will be a quick review. A lot of people had complaints with the resolution of this camera. What happened was Schlage was limiting the resolution and really compressing the data link through the bridge in 2009-2010 for whatever reason.In 2011 they announced at CES they will allow high resolution down-link (its now an option) @ full 640 x 480 resolution at 30 frames. The feature is now enabled and works great. The camera's resolution has greatly improved and looks much better.Now they need to add IR, motorized, and outdoor cameras to their line up!", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "ok camera with no practical / function with other zwave devices", "Author": "Gary Hall \"GHall\"", "ReviewID": "RXDZ0KU1WDWFG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have 3 of these but there is no practical use for them. easy setup. At times they become \"disconnected\" and must be powered down and brought back up (great when I'm not home - I'll have to get the pets trained to do that).When I log on I usually see an empty room or a door. Two minutes is the max you can view at a time.If you are engaged with something - unless you can run to a pc / phone and login, you will miss whatever it was that occurred (such as an attempt to guess the codes of their locks).  Currently there is no way to record what it sees -  it cannot even take a picture and email it. The company's response when asked if they will add this - \"we are researching it (for over a year now)\".  The locks are great, cameras may be ok for observing people family members (creepy - I'd suggest a web cam where they KNOW you are watching) or pets in a room (that is fully lit and a very narrow view), but do not depend on any form of recording or pictures for any event with other devices.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Easy setup and it works fine for surveillance", "Author": "Pamela", "ReviewID": "R21HDJX8J1I5ZA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is a great addition to the Schlage Z-Wave system. The camera is an on-demand camera that can ge engaged from your smartphone. When I view it on my smartphone it looks fine. It is meant as a surveillance camera and not an HD camera. I agree that with technology today, the quality should be better. However, the downside of that is you will pay for that in speed and data charges on your phone. I primarly use the camera from my smartphone as I bought the Schlage system to keep an eye on my dogs and the comings and goings of the dog nanny while I am away on business trips and vacations.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Stay Away", "Author": "Henry L.

That's about the only good part of this camera. This is a low quality camera that does not allow you to record, notify on motion events, or email you an image of motion detection.

To make matters worse, they don't allow you to login into the camera any other way than to pay Schlage $12 / month and use their website.The Schlage Link system works on iPhone but they haven't updated the app in over a year, and it doesn't work natively on iPads, or utilize iOS 4's backgrounding or display.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not what I thought", "Author": "Michael Evans", "ReviewID": "R1Z5JGUKPYEFEV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I have a thermostat on the same network and I was going to use this camera for remote viewing of my new house. What I do not like about it is that after viewing it for 2 minutes, it times out and disconnects and I have to start the viewing over again. Also, it does not have any sound. It would be great if it could alert a smartphone that there was movement from the camera. On a good note, the camera was fairly easy to setup and it is portable and it does work from remote locations. I was in another country and was able to view my camera in my house. The signal was a little delayed and jumpy but was able to see something.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for price....easy to use", "Author": "B.

Even worse, it requires that you pay Nexia a monthly service fee for a service that doesn't work the majority of the time.  I have wasted many hours on the phone trying to get a Nexia/Schlage representative to just help me get this product working, and all I get is the run around.  Each time they state that nobody is available to help, and that someone will eventually call you back.... then days/weeks pass, and nobody from Nexia/Schlage will ever return your call.  And if you don't continue to pay their ridiculous monthly service fee all the Nexia/Schlage equipment you purchased immediately stops working (can't be used at all.... just a paper weight).  So in the end you have a bunch of overpriced equipment that doesn't work.  Nexia/Schlage is a NIGHTMARE!

It only took me about 10 minutes to setup the camera and add it to my Link system. The camera shows up right away with an easy to use interface. It was also very easy to add to my iPhone Link app. This would be a five star camera if it wasn't for the horrid image quality. The resolution is nowhere near the claimed 640x480, it is about half that. The image is tremendously over-compressed! At a distance of more than a few feet everything becomes a pixelated mess. See my Customer Image above. The low light performance is also quite bad. There is no motion detection feature or a way to capture and save video or stills. I emailed Schlage and asked if there was a way to improve the image quality but their response was \"no, sorry.\" Stay FAR away from this product. MUCH better cameras can be had for less money.
