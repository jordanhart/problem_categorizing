{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Basic security camera, easy to set up", "Author": "P. Parenteau", "ReviewID": "R1589GW983J3K6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I needed a basic camera for my attic to see what type of critter has been visiting in the wee hours of the morning.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I heard that Swann was better than the other brands.  The camera setup is really easy and I was able to get the system running in 30 minutes.  (Most of the time was spent screwing the base of the camera to the rafter.Video quality with room-level lighting is fine.  Near darkness, the image switches to B&W; and is pretty grainy.  I may buy an additional IR light source if my critter friend decides to show up at night only.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "ON SALE IT'S A GREAT CAM .... BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT \"NIGHT VISION\"", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R26XZHO8V632ST", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "GOT A GREAT DEAL.  WORKS GREAT WITH DECENT QUALITY IMAGE FOR COMPARABLE CAMERAS.  PRO - NICE VERY LONG CORD WHICH MAKES IT VERY EASY TO PLACE.THE 'NIGHT VISION' .... DOES NOT WORK THROUGH GLASS!  It emits IR light which reflects off the window if the camera is placed inside and is recording what is outside through a window and makes it totally unable to capture any image at all ... at night through glass.Otherwise it's great.  I think the IR light reflecting is typical for 'night vision' that is not 'TRUE NIGHT VISION' but is based on Infrared Light.note: I saw a lot of negative reviews of the \"SWANN\" brand around on various sites.  I think it is a great product and have even purchased a totally different type of product, but made my decision based on the SWANN brand and am very pleased.Good PDF downloads on their site with detailed specs on their products.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "GS Wholesale Rating Manipulation", "Author": "A. Dhaliwal", "ReviewID": "R1VORFU5DG56ZP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is a very disingenuous practice to write a 5 star \"customer review\" of a product that you are a seller of. Even if it is under the guise of \"Additional Product Info!\", it is still manipulating the rating system at Amazon, since customers sort searches with average customer rating and your products come out on top. Because of your lack of integrity as a seller, I will never buy a GS Wholesale product. I am also going to complain to Amazon about your rating manipulation.", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "380 TV Lines for clear image resolution\n16ft (5m) infra-red night vision\n60ft (18m) RCA video cable\nSleek, compact & stylish design\nPerfect for home & office use", "Name": "Swann SW211-STY StyleCam Security Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418DMK1HLRL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00137FF8Q"}}
