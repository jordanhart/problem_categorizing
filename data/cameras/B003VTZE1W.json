It takes nice, high quality pictures and videos. It's easy to use, with a nice large screen, and plenty of memory. The face recognition feature is something I have never encountered before, and I really like it - it makes it really easy to find pictures.The only con to this camera is the use of AA batteries. It does go through them relatively quickly, so if you are going to be shooting all day, you really must carry a supply of them with you.

I had a Kodak C633 before that I loved but wanted to upgrade. This takes such sharp pictures and has even more features then my last one. It also has more zoom on it then my old one did and more mega pixels. Love the face finder and it seemed to take great pictures indoors. I also love the color of this camera it is a nice shade of purple. For the people who complain about the batteries going dead quickly the way to solve that is use rechargable batteries!!

And for cranking out little jpeg images to the web, it is just fine...however, it would be nice to have the option of taking higher quality photos, since they also advertise this camera as 14 megapixel. That's a joke, because while I'm sure the equipment is capable of shooting a very clear photo, it automatically compresses every image so that if you view it at actual size (or feel like making a large print) it's extremely fuzzy. This is probably in the interest of allowing you to cram more photos onto a card, but at least give us a choice to sacrifice some space for a crisper picture.That aside, it's also not great at regulating the blur that occurs from the slightest subject or hand movement. It's not the most expensive camera in the world, but you could go even cheaper for the quality Kodak is providing here. And if you want good quality photos, you might just have to spend a tad more money to get something decent.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Full of Features, But Fuzzy Photos", "Author": "D. Phillips", "ReviewID": "RE81XM8NY2Q03", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been using a Kodak Z1275 for a couple of years and I loved it!  It was 14MP and full of features, most of which I eventually learned how to use.  I regularly had photos blown up to poster size or printed on pillow cases and blankets.  They were always crisp and clear when I used the automatic setting.  Unfortunately, Kodak does not make that camera any longer.  (My beloved camera fell off the back of a chair when taking photos two weekends ago so it is no longer working.)I looked for a Kodak camera with the same features.  What I found was the C195.  It is not exactly the same (e.g. 5x optical zoom vs. the Z1275 have 3X optical and another 5x digital), but most of the settings were exactly like the camera I loved.  It even uses 2 AA batteries and is the same size (pocket-worthy).  Despite noticing some dust under the display on the rear, I was thrilled with the first four test photos so I registered the camera the same day it arrived from Amazon.I did not really take \"normal\" photos until this past weekend.  I took 647 photos and videos while on a trip to Disney.  As my 4GB memory card filled up I decided to look for bad photos and delete them to make extra space.  That is when I noticed that some of the pictures looked blurry.  I wear glasses so I asked several other people for their opinions and they agreed.  I thought it might be related to the dust under 1/8 of the screen on the back, but when I downloaded the photos to my computer I found that every 4th, 5th, or 6th photo was horribly blurry.  That was very frustrating, but also very sad as many of those photos were once-in-a-lifetime shots (e.g. my wife making very close eye contact with one of the Boys II Men singers).  I am sending this camera back to Amazon tomorrow.  I am not going to buy another C-series camera from Kodak.  Those moments cannot be replaced.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "TXMommy", "ReviewID": "R16MAI8OB2LBMB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After buying a Nikon Cool Pics to replace my broken Kodak EasyShare, I was very disappointed.

Twarog", "ReviewID": "R2MS0GCZUNRY3I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Two years ago, I bought a Kodak Easy Share, 7 megapixels, for $99.00.  I love the camera but decided to buy another Kodak only this time with 14 megapixels because everyone told me that with more megapixels, the photos would be even clearer.  Well, that was a waste of money for me.  For one thing, my old camera is sturdier and the features easier to access, the buttons are stronger and are easier to use --  even the telescopic/wide lens work better and are not clumsy, like on the the C195 model.  Sometimes, my camera will take the picture (by itself) while I'm focusing and other times, the \"clicker\" seems to stick.  In fairness, the photos turn out looking pretty good but not any better than on my older model and, in some cases, not as good.  I used this camera often so I could really test it out and be able to present a thoroughly researched review.In summary, I did not notice any real difference between the 7 megapixels camera versus the 14.  Both cameras take good pictures.  However, the quality of the C195 is definitely much cheaper and it frequently does \"its own thing\"I was going to use my old camera as a backup and use the new one as my primary camera.  However, I am now going to reverse that order and go back to my reliable, older Kodak.  It has never disappointed me and the photos are beautiful.I guess it's true what they say about change.  In many cases, change doesn't mean better especially if it doesn't produce positive results. Come to think of it, I guess that is true of anything in life. :)", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak EasyShare C195", "Author": "gopowershome", "ReviewID": "R3GPEPE0HO5T5R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little camera fits easily in a back pocket or purse, which is why I got it. It doesn't come with a manual but is pretty easy to figure out. Getting to know the adjustments, light for example, takes a little practice but the learning curve is pretty fast. A wonderful, compact camera that takes great pictures. The easy share feature is fantastic.  Just tag the photo and when uploading, the photos will automatically be sent to social media apps while also being uploaded to the computer photo program. This camera is perfect for young people just starting out with photography, as well as experienced photographers who like to have a camera with them but not schlep around the equipment.

I assumed you could \"Share\" anyplace there was wifi.  No.  You STILL have to connect the phone via USB, which in essence makes the \"Share\" button pointless...even it if DID work...Apparently, Windows upgraded their security and it blocks this from connecting as a camera automatically.

I use it for small things, taking pictures to send back home and such, and it works perfectly. There isn't much I can say that is bad about this camera, and the bad things are pretty minuscule too. First, I am a big man and I have huge hands and fingers and the buttons are so tiny, well, not really, but they are not big enough for my hands. I can manage with that though, so no biggie. Another gripe I had was there wasn't a memory card included, but again, it wasn't important really, they aren't expensive. My biggest complaint, and the only one that was important to me was the microphone built in the camera. It is very difficult to hear unless you talk quite loudly. But, it is something I can deal with because I don't take that many videos, I just wish it was louder. Some will complain about the battery, but my battery lasts for three days, even if I use it for 6 hours a day, I don't know why anyone is really complaining, just buy rechargeable batteries and your problem is solved. Oh, and the software you download is a big problem for me. It is slow and it takes a very long time to upload the photos, I have a fast computer, I can download 100 songs in seconds, but this software just takes about an hour to upload 20 pictures. That is my biggest complaint. I have sidestepped that though, now I just take my memory card and put it in my laptop SD slot and shazaam!

After only a week's use, the new camera started alerting me that battery power was low and shutting off automatically every time I went to take a picture. I tried new batteries, but they didn't make a difference, so I returned it, thinking it must be defective; but the replacement (another C195) is doing the same thing. It seems to be an issue either with the door to the battery area not closing properly, or the battery power just not getting through to the system -- but I am highly dissatisfied. I can't even get one picture off before the camera shuts back off again. It should be noted that it worked fine for the first few weeks, and then this issue came about. I did not drop this camera and was extremely careful with it, since I had dropped and broken the first one, so I can only imagine this is a manufacturing defect.

Here's my explanation why:Pros:Beautiful camera, wonderful large screen, easy to operate, uses 2 AA batteries, no special batteries needed, nice adjustable setting on the picture size format from 1mp 4:3, 2mp 16:9, 3mp 4:3, 6mp 4:3, 10mp 16:9, 12mp 3:2, 14mp 4:3 video out options NTSC/PAL, upgradable memory to 32mp. Has automatic focus, I found it quite easy to setup and program the camera. I do have to admit it does take some really good pictures though!! I'm overall quite pleased with the camera, even with it's little cons to it, mainly because of the quality of pictures it takes and ease of setting up the program on the camera itself.  Yes, I would certainly recommend this camera.Cons:Looking at the back of the camera in the sun/daylight is sometimes very hard to see, way too bright no matter how far down you take the light setting on the camera. The download link from Kodak is not supported anymore, you have to hunt down the link yourself, after installing the drive and program on the camera, then I found out that it does not support sending to email, FaceBook or social media.  On the 14mp that comes with the camera, you can only take an 8 second video and the sound is very hard to hear on there. The buttons on the top and back of the camera are a little hard to get to, luckily I have finger nails and use the tip of them to turn the camera on or the button selections on the back right of the view finder. Also the highest memory card you can go is a 32mp.

Good lens bad sensor", "Author": "Pikkidok", "ReviewID": "R1CVC4VZP1ABFB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because it was cheap,  it is a Kodak and simply for the fun of having an inexpensive AA powered camera.It cost me less than USD50 as I believe retailers of clearing stocks and quite possibly there will not be manufacturer warranty anymore.I will not review the video or movie aspect as I have not used it for recording any video.The camera is well built although it is plasticky.It is well designed and comfortable to hold.It looks really nice and no one will believe it cost less than USD50.The plastic however is an oil magnet and it can get dirty easily but you can wipe the dirt off just as easily.The screen is large and bright. One of its strongest points.On top of the camera are 3 tiny buttons. On/Off switch, Mode button and the Flash button.Not suitable if you have very fat fingers. You need to use your nails to push them.If you are used to most mainstream Japanese brand cameras, the user interface is a bit different but you will get used to it.I must say users of these camera is either a novice or someone who are not much into photography.It can function without much adjustment. Switch on and shoot away.It obviously lacks input into some settings unlike other more expensive cameras. I guess most users will not be bothered with these.Default mode is the Smart capture mode where the camera does everything for you. You only decide whether you want flash auto, on or off. Everything else is done for you. You can decide how many mega pixels you want your pictures to be captured.You have the P mode or program mode where you can input ISO settings, focusing and metering options.Then you have the scene mode where you can select from a few scenes to optimize the settings for your picture.The lens is actually quite good. Sharp. Minimal distortion and few flares.However I think the CCD sensor is not on par with the lens.The CCD sensor is very likely old tech and is not very sensitive and the processors is probably not top notch.Canon and Nikon have very good sensors which are more sensitive despite the same size as this.The photos show color smearing  and noise even at low ISO of 200.The colors are dull except when shot at the lowest ISO. Pictures are sharp though.Essentially a set of good lens in front of a bad sensor.The camera compensates for its weak sensor by automatically setting a low ISO for most non-flash shotsWith low ISO, the shutter speed will be slow. This will cause blurry shots unless you have rock steady hands.In summary,There is a good reason to buy this camera. It is cheap and it uses AA batteries.But remember to use flash indoors even if you think it is relatively bright. The camera sensor cannot handle poor light condition too well. Much worse compared to other compacts but then, other compacts are more expensive and may have a more advanced CMOS sensor.Remember to use a tripod if you do not want to use the flash.Outdoors, if bright, keep a steady hand and you will be rewarded with sharp photographs.Despite this camera's critical weaknesses.I still like it. I like cheap AA powered compacts and it is a soon to be rare Kodak camera", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Miguel Angel Gonzalez \"Soymuyprospero\"", "ReviewID": "R1TEIY38SFOB5D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

So when we did the safari ride my camera was ready to go, we get to the giraffe area and they were in reaching distance of us. Go to take a photo and...Batteries died. Even though a moment prior the battery life showed half life. Mind you the camera was less than a week old with brand new batteries. So we missed the opportunities with the Giraffe's. As for the rest of the safari we used our cell phones.I had read other reviews on this product saying it took blurry photos, and the battery life was bad. I associated it to the user rather than the camera (could not have been more wrong). Anyways we purchased new batteries, again and continued using it for the duration of our vacation. Once we got home and went to show our family the photos on the computer, that's when we realized over 70% of them were blurry!!! We even had it set on either the sports mode or blur reduction mode the entire time! Our cell phones took better photos as far as clarity. Very dissapointed with this camera.

While the Kodak suggests that it is simple to use I (1)find it difficult to get the flash option I want - in some instances I have to reset it manually - loosing the shot I wanted/needed, (2) feel it changes scene settings by itself - I can't imagine I'm doing it because the button to change the scenes is also difficult to navigate, and (3) find that when photograping animals or people, pictures are blurry if they move just a slight bit. I guess you get what you pay for and if you only need to take very simple pictures in well lite rooms you'll be fine.

Wanted to replace my 5 yr old Kodak Easyshare that didn't have an LCD display and was 4MP.  This camera at 14MP takes the same quality pictures, no difference.  Another issue is that the batteries were dead in 2 days, sent by Kodak with the camera, with very little use, less than 20 photos taken.  My older Kodak could use the same batteries for 3 wks!  Also, the controls are difficult to navigate without using a fingernail and low light situations take poor photos, there's some type of delay for the flash and then you loose your shot.  Another issue is that it states takes SDHC cards but these cards have to be formatted, unlike regular SD cards and if you take the SDHC card out you have to go to the trouble of reformatting again.  SDHC card was not recognized when I tried to upload photos, whereas any SD card that I used in the camera was no problem uploading.  Also, didn't like the fact that there's no viewfinder for outside photos, in addition to LCD screen and you have to date stamp each photo that you take instead of just setting the date once and the date appearing on all photos you take unless you remove that option.

It does not come with software, but directs you to Kodak's website, which says \"KODAK EASYSHARE Software is no longer available as a download. We regret any inconvenience to you.\"  They stopped supporting the software in March 2013, so why it was still sold as an \"easyshare\" camera with all the sharing features (email, facebook, etc) for the Christmas 2013 season and beyond is inexcusable.  So, the little red button on the camera for easyshare does nothing because the required software can no longer be downloaded!  (I'm not sure upon more reading that it really did anything besides upload for you...it might not have been that useful anyway.  I don't think it had any intended wireless capability, just uploading to your preferred location when you upload to your computer.)As for ease of use, I got it for my four year old as it is no doubt much higher quality than toy cameras after reading those reviews.  I occasionally even snap a picture with it for myself if I don't have my \"real\" camera handy.  The picture quality is not exceptional but probably quite good for the level camera it is.  There are very few buttons and options and a nice large screen, which is what I wanted for my four year old.  She really enjoys it and figured out how to use it and see her pictures right away. One thing I like is that the flash is easy to turn off when you need to (button dedicated to flash - not buried in a menu).If it weren't for the misleading marketing and I was taking price into account, I would give it a pretty high rating because it is an easy to use camera and it was very inexpensive.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "takes good pictures.", "Author": "Richard A.

I almost didn't get it because so many reviewers said the software wasn't available but then realized that for my purposes it didn't really matter. I still haven't checked to see if It is or isn't available. Be aware though that this camera blows through batteries and comes with an internal storage capacity of only five photos so i added an SD card and some rechargeable batteries.

She loves taking pictures but very few were usable with this crappy camera so she was losing some memorable moments.She is older and not tech-savvy at all! She has a flip cell phone and an @aol email address (hopefully that paints the picture I am trying to show you) so I knew I had to be careful with the next camera she would own.This really was the perfect option for her to be honest:1. It is inexpensive, good to give as a gift for someone that doesn't care about the latest technology or the hottest brand.2. It is nice and simple, she wanted a camera to simple do \"camera things\" and doesn't need to extras. The buttons are basic and it is easy to see what each of them do. Also, the screen is nice and big so she can see the pictures clearly.3. So easy to use, I gave her a tutorial on the camera when she opened it. I told her how to use the flash, how to focus when taking a picture, zoom, and how to view the pictures. This only took a few minutes and she totally understood.4. Small and light weight, good for traveling. She went on a cruise with the camera and there was not a bunch of equipment to carry around.I looked at the pictures after the cruise and it seems like she remembered the tutorial I gave her. The pictures were clear and she had snapped pics of everything!!! She was so exited about the clarity of the pictures that she did not want to miss out on anything.This camera does however use AA batteries. You can buy a rechargeable one if you want but I just got her a pack of batteries to go with it.

You can read about them in other reviews.  Once one gains familiarity with its use, it becomes easy to operate.My one serious complaint is the clarity of the pictures.  For a 14 megapixel camera I would expect to see more and more detail as I blow the picture up.  With the C195, I do, but as I reach the point where I should start seeing clear individual pixels, I instead see a fuzzy, blurry unclear image. Individual pixels are not clearly visible.  (I experimented with a tripod and delayed image capture to prevent any possibility of inadvertent motion or shaking.)  I don't know the exact reason for this problem.  It could be compromised lens, CDD card or even the compression formula for the JPEG images, but whatever the cause, it is wasting its high stated megapixel capability.  It may as well be a 5 megapixel camera.It's really a shame as I like so many other things about this little camera.4/4/2014 - Apparently even Kodak won't support this loser with its download EasyShare software any longer.

It will put a big red dot on your face if it's too close.There are no options in regards to video format.  I'd like to take a video at 10 frames per second.  Maybe w/ 8-bit color.  I'd like to choose the resolution of the audio-storage as well.  I'd like to be able to make this video-recorder make a 3 hour video, if the batteries could last that long.  The batteries die out quick.  I open the battery case, when not in use, so they don't drain.  I use 1.2 volt NiMh batteries and they work OK.  I could probably take 20 pictures before they need to be recharged.Now the screen cover did crack.  another user reported the same problem & gave it a 1 rating.  The front eye-lid is supposed to auto-open & close.  Mine is stuck sometimes.  I have to open it w/ my finger... But I can still use it.  Again, another user had the same problem.  My equipment takes a beating.  I guess I'm luck it works at all.It's user-friendly & intuitive enough.  No complaints there at all.  I don't mind having to use my fingernail to turn it on or off.  No big problem.  But I don't like having to enter in the date or click serveral buttons to get out of that menu, every time I turn the camera on (as I said, I open the battery door when not in use, so this effects that), still.  It's redundant and takes up time.So, overall, it's a good camera, but, I sincerely wish they had the features I want, that I named above, that they don't have.  I dont mind the crack...  I can work around it.  It's a good work horse, but it has major issues, and if it had a flexible audio/picture compression... settings, it would be much better, but few cameras have that as an option.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "DIGITAL CAMERA FOR NOVICES", "Author": "Mary J.

The screenwas white w/ a black hole and the lens was completely ripped off. My husband sent back a complaint and said that is not how it was shipped.

One other annoying (for me) factor is it won't save your last setting once you power off.

(I have tried to find a way to clear out the first shot so I can set up the next one, but have not been able to do it.)  I have an eight month old child and to get nice shots you need to shoot repeatedly while she is moving and hope to catch a good one here and there. This camera is not at all suited for that.  Also, there is a marked delay between depressing the button and the photo taking.  Most times, what I see on the screen when I take the shot (which then goes black) is nothing close to what is actually photographed when the screen lights up again.

Speaking of the memory card, when you attempt to get it out of the camera, the batteries fall out and by the way, the camera eats batteries, BIG time. The on/off switch is difficult to use (it's sort of recessed) and you can only date your pic AFTER you've taken it! There is NO user manual.

On 90% of my interior shots I have to lighten the photos in a computer software program. There is no way I have found to adjust the Fstop as there is in the Olympus so you are at the mercy of it's auto adjust to everything and it's not too picky about getting things lit or focused. The viewfinder has an adjustment so you can lighten what you see there, but then you aren't getting what you see on the viewfinder!

For anything much beyond that, its not very good. It may actually be one of Kodak's worse. The buttons are tiny, in a crevice and not easy to use unless you can look at the camera in the light. You will never be able to turn the camera on quickly for a spontaneous photo. Not really all that big of a deal since it won't capture a quick picture anyway. The delay from the time you press the button to take the picture and the camera records it is so long that many subjects will not even be in the picture. Tried to take pics of the Air Force Thunderbirds, the only way possible is to 'snap' the picture before the planes are even within the camera's viewfinder.  Then many times, it will blur a picture anyway. Turning the flash on and off, too difficult. Cannot turn flash on by the push of a button (it will only go to auto) you have to go to the programs. The program menu takes a while to navigate so you may lose a picture while trying to find a workable setting. And if the camera goes into auto shut off, you have to go through the whole programing thing again because it will come back on in auto only. All in all, the worse I have ever had and I have always been a huge Kodak fan. Don't have any idea what they were thinking of but this is a huge disappointment. Again, for a planned family event or some thing similar, probably good enough.

It takes forever for picture to get stored to memory card once you snap your picture. My memory card has speed of 4, which is standard memory card speed and my other cameras store it in 1 second. Next thing that sucks is that you have to hold you hand still when you take pictures or they will come out blurry. If you use flashlight your pictures will most of the time come out blurry. Video quality sucks really bad, it's all grainy like ancient old tv picture quality with snow in it. The sound in the video is really bad as well. Can't even compare with my 10 year old digital camera by sony. I tried to connect it to computer to upload pictures but it would never turn on. It was always like this since I purchased it. I had to put in memory card in my other camera to be able to upload pictures on pc.
