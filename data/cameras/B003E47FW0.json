It is cute and lightweight, but this camera is junk. Even at the highest settings the photos were grainy and blurry. I can't imagine who would be satisfied with the terrible photos. Don't waste your time or money on this one.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "I've never hated a camera before...", "Author": "Sally Mullaney \"Catinmylap\"", "ReviewID": "R2VRCX1DY7UD5V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Polaroid should be embarrassed. These 500 series cameras are garbage. \"Lightweight\" means \"made like crap\".  \"Easy to use\" means it's only good for \"point and shoot\" at one setting.  I unload the images, erase the card and guess what? When I unload the next batch, they unload WITH THE SAME NUMBERS, so off they go to be with the first photo. Where?  Who knows? I tried creating a folder to load them into and renaming them. Nope. Help? Try to find a manual on Polaroid's website.  Redirect, redirect.  Menu in the camera is a joke. Macro/Landscape switch is on the side of the camera and gets flipped all the time.Yep, I may be a little more angry than a camera deserves, but I just uploaded photos from two important events - all blurry and grainy.  Yes, it was inexpensive but still overpriced for garbage. Like I said - Polaroid should be embarrassed.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not worth it", "Author": "Lyndsley", "ReviewID": "R7GB2PUMDCW5N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a very poor quality camera. It takes bad pictures and is not at all user friendly. I bought it for my 14 year old daughter, and she used it a few times, but now keeps asking to borrow my Kodak camera because she dislikes the pictures the Polaroid takes. I definitely would not recommend this camera to anyone. It's junk.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worthless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1Q44MIOWZOZPX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a silver one of these cameras as a stocking stuffer. I thought that at less than $40, it was a steal. Well it was a steal alright .......but by Polaroid! picture quality is poor, and the flash only appears to work with brand new batteries. After a couple of pictures, the flash stops working regardless of setting. In addition, the camera uses AAA batteries, which are not available as lithium. This means that it will need new batteries after only a few shots. What a rip off, my cell phone does better than this! Shame on you Polaroid, I will never buy anything with your name on it again!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst purchase I ever made...", "Author": "Alice Henry \"luv 2 read\"", "ReviewID": "R2L1ODA7Q2SOMK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I do not like this camera.

To be fair I wasn't really looking for anything amazing considering that she is still young, but I am absolutely amazed at just how crappy this camera is. I can only assume Polaroid went out of their way to make this as a joke, because there is zero need for this product to exist in its current state. It doesn't even like to turn on correctly. Sadly, I seem to have lost the receipt so now I am stuck with it and left wishing I had just ponied up the extra cash to get a real digital.

It's lower-than-entry level category, but what do you expect for the price?However, there are annoying details where the product details are misleading:- no digital zoom- no internal memory (when you turn on without SD card inserted, it won't let you shoot)- AAA batteries are depleted within 1 day of usage - this is the most annoying. I wonder if other users had the same experience.
