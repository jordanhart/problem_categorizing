I thought I had wasted my $79 when I decided to test all the settings before rushing to the store to return it. I found out, you have to be selective and never leave it on AUTO for all the instances you are going to use it.I was replacing the old J20 that I dropped a few weeks ago, braking the screen. It still turns on and takes pictures, but you can't see them. OK, so what is up with this camera? They put way too many features like in an expensier camera and you have to decidewhen to use them;  unlike with previous ones that were truly point and shoots. So, it is not really a point and shoot.SPECIAL SETTINGS OVERVIEWSR (AUTO), short for Scene Recognition is great. It can detect if you are taking a macro shot, a night shot, wide angle, etc...That's where I set it at normally and what I recommend you buyers do, otherwise you are bound to get lots of blurry and faded photos.The other feature I like is the \"NATURAL\" with Flash(icon): It takes two pictures; with & without flash and combines them for a perfect photo. The results differ drastically from the simple flash mode, or addition of flash to AUTO mode.Finally but not least, I love the feature of Night (TRIPOD) since it allows the camera to use the low exposure maximum minimum shutter speed of 8 secs. Perfect for long exposures on really low light conditions and zero movement. I tried it on my tripod and used a shutter delay of 2 seconds pointing it to the sky. There were two tiny stars that did not come up on the picture (did not expect them to), but the sky was pitch dark with no noise and the roof of my house came up perfectly in focus. The exposure was recorded at 4 secs, though specs say the maximum is 8 seconds.Then the NIGHT mode alone is fine. And there are a few more specific settings, the former been the most important for my usage and mode of photograph. Try them all and find your niche.THE CONS-- Position of on/off button is weird and difficult to reach. it would be difficult for anyone with fat fingers to turn it on.-- Same with battery release, weirdly positioned. In the J20 it was better located.-- Sluggish trigger button, you can loose some moments if you have to quickly grab the camera and shoot. Worst than in J20.-- No charger, you have to charge the battery in-camera with a USB cable. I prefer to remove the battery and use a charger, which it doesn't have. So I use the J20's battery and charger. Who wants to have the camera hanging from a USB cable to charge the BATTERY?SUMMARY:Overall, if you can master its quirks, it is a camera that will withstand some sort of rough treatment without feeling you are loosing BIG MONEY if you drop it or scratch it. It is at a good price in some upcoming Black Friday offers (look it up, $49.00, WOW!) .MY GAIN:I can use the J20 charger and battery, bypassing the quirky USB-in-camera charging.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfectly Camera", "Author": "Brenda Pierson", "ReviewID": "R4T8LYG0MS5OV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes beautiful pictures and is so easy to use.

This fuji takes some of the worst pictures I have seen from a newer digital camera. It has an extreamly hard time focusing, the lighting has to be perfect and still the pictures it takes are very fuzzy and blurry. I am so mad and frustrated that I but this piece of junk. It is crazy how companies are advertising these high meagpixel cameras but old cameras with half the M.P. shoot far better pictures.

Lin", "ReviewID": "R3HX2IDW7OXQXM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The specs point to it being a great point and shoot, even on the budget end, but I didn't like the pictures it takes.  On the onboard LCD (granted, 3\" is big), on the closest \"zoom\" of a taken picture, you can see the noise and fuzzyness.  I didn't try it in bright light and daylight, but I need an all purpose camera.  The flash can be really bright.  Down side is that the automatic white balance overcompensates and then everything looks yellow in the end. It almost would have been better without the flash.Face detection only works so-so; it picked up a bag in the upper right corner instead of my son's face in the center, and it has a tendancy to misjudge the lighting.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "I wrongly associated Fujifilm with quality.", "Author": "Asiedydd", "ReviewID": "R1YUVVM331LIBJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Many images are blurry, particularly when using the optical zoom or flash in dark indoors.At 7 months old, it now freezes up after one or two pictures and shows a snowy screen.
