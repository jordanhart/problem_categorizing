{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An amazing camera for the price", "Author": "Nate Train \"Nate Train\"", "ReviewID": "R1LW9TPXJEQBCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already purchased and have a VideoSecu 1/3'' Sony Effio CCD dome camera with 700 tv lines which I have been using for a year now. I bought this camera mainly for the inside of my house to keep an eye on my dogs while away. I can honestly say for a 420 line 1/4\" camera this actually is better then the dome camera that I have that costs more. Colors and lines seem more crisp. Hard to believe, but its true. I'm still wondering if maybe the dome camera I have just isn't as good or if something was wrong with it out of the box. It works and looks great, but the quality is less when video is compared side by side with both cameras.The camera itself is small which is perfect in my opinion. It's solid casing is great and it's easy to hook up. The audio cable that comes in the package works pretty good too.Since I have a 4 channel DVR I am already planning on buying 2 more of these. Very happy I chose this camera after looking at so many others.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$129.99", "Features": "Affordable day night vision video CMOS security camera.
