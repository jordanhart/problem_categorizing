{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Like a user-friendly version of the J38 with new features!!!", "Author": "1Dub79", "ReviewID": "R34Z8SNIIAQYES", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This version of the Finepix has many similarities to the Fujifilm Finepix J38 12MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD, which I reviewed in November. There are a few differences. One new feature of this camera is the HD Movie Mode, which shows in 720p and 1920 x 1080 stills. The camera also has compatibility with HDTVs, which means the pictures will show in HD, if they are reviewed on an HDTV. The camera also has a new Smile and Blink Detection system. Once the shooter holds the camera up to a subject, who smiles, the camera will automatically take the photo. The Blink Detection feature is nice because the camera will alert the shooter that subject is blinking. Therefore, the shooter will have the option to take a better photo.I also noticed after reviewing a taken photo, a message will say \"face detected.\" The user now has the option to do a close-up review of the person's face, whom they have taken a picture of. Another difference is this camera is a little more user-friendly. The camera now has a shooting mode dial. This means the person can just turn the dial to the shooting mode, which they want to go to. In addition, the modes tell you what they do. Still, a user will have to go to the menus to do modify the camera, such as change the movie mode and shooting image quality and repeated shooting options. Compared to the Fujifilm Finepix J38 12MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD, I must say that the JV100's photos are a little more vivid. I took pictures with both and saw the difference. I must admit, the HD movie mode is very underrated. In fact, it shows almost as good as many HD camcorders. Collectively, that makes this camera a steal.The biggest flaw with this camera is the HD Movie Mode just sucks the life out of the camera. I would suggest staying using that mode wisely. With that in mind, users are not obligated to use the HD movie mode. It can be changed to the 640 x 480 shooting resolution. Another flaw is this camera cannot be charged, while the battery is in the camera. The battery must be taken out, and placed in the charger. Also, the camera was poorly designed for recording a movie. For example, the female part, which the tripod screws in, is on the bottom right side of the camera. Most cameras have it directly at the bottom of the camera. Not to mention, the built-in microphone is right next to it. Some tri-pods will cover a portion of the built-in microphone. This can lead to altered play-back on the movies. These issues make me give this camera a rating of four.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Many Feautures", "Author": "Christi <3", "ReviewID": "R3170ISC1U2BPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a present for my 15th birthday. I loved it at once because of the sleek appearance and handy mode dial. Another nifty part about it is that there are 10+ ''positions\"  and on  the screen it has a discription of each one. They are: Snow, Fireworks, Baby, Portrait, Night Scenery (tripod and no tripod), Sport, Landscape, Panorama, Text, Flower (macro), Party, Beach, Sunset, and Smile& Shoot. Each one actually makes a big difference, and it's nice to have so many options. Most other Point&Shoots; do not have so many.Something I love about the JV100 is that it has SRAuto, which automatically selects the best mode according to the situation. It is actually really accurate and perfect if you're in a hurry.The picture quality is also impressive. Both indoors and outdoors the images come out nicely and with a lot of detail and depth. The colors are beautiful and vivid. The movie mode is pretty good, and a plus is that you can zoom while taping.The only problems I have with this FinePix are that the Smile&Shoot; doesn't always work, but that's not a major deal. My last complaint is the battery life. I have to charge it at least once a day.Pros:-many position options-great price for value-good image quality-you can zoom while recording a video-easy to use and figure out-compact and good looking-huge LCD screenCons:-only comes in blue and black-ok battery lifeP.S. The camera comes with a CD that is great for organizing and editing your uploaded pictures. Cool!Overall, this is a great camera that I'd recommend for anyone that wants a Point and Shoot. FugiFilm has really done a great job.Thanks for reading!_________________________________________Update, July 13My little brother dropped this camera from about 5 ft in the air and it started to have issues with turning on. I was reluctant to return it, but the thing would rarely turn on so I had no choice. I pruchased the FinePix Z70 as a replacement, and heres my experiance: This one is better than the newer, more expensive model. I would like to get the JV100 again, but my mom won't let me because she doesn't want to deal with Best Buy's costumer service again :(", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera, super price!", "Author": "Gary", "ReviewID": "R3289P7HY38HKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife to replace an Olympus that had been lost. I was looking for a simple to use little digital camera that would take excellent pictures and that is what she got with this camera.

There has been no abuse, water submersion, or any other events to cause a malfunction not even humidity, I live in a temperate desert. All of a sudden an error message of \"TURN CAMERA OFF AND TURN IT ON AGAIN\" appeared stopping the camera from functioning. I contacted Fujifilm's technical support to trouble shoot the problem. Their answer was to reset the camera to its default settling. When this didn't work they referred me to the return and repair department where they informed me that I would have to pay to ship the camera to one of there repair facility and it would take 15 business days after receiving the device before they would begin to diagnose the camera and email me quote for the repairs. I think this is unacceptable I'll cut my losses now before I have to repeat this process again in another 3 months.

I took some pictures with it. The details were totally washed out, it was unresponsive in its auto-smile feature, and the video quality was garbage. Look up some of the videos on youtube.

There have been several occasions where I've charged this camera the a day or two before I've needed it only to find that the battery was dead by the time I've gone to use it.My second complaint is the difficulty I have had trying to import photos to my computer (Mac). The files are corrupt and I've lost a lot of pictures I needed. I'm also having trouble viewing the files on the camera itself, it keeps giving me a \"read error.\"This camera broke after only a couple of uses and even if it was only $20 it would be a rip-off.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good, Quality Camera for the Price", "Author": "Carson True \"Carson\"", "ReviewID": "R1OCTPBW9VDEEG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had several PAC cameras in the past and after my last one broke, I needed to definitely purchase a new one. I was looking for something with good, sharp pictures, but something that didn't beat me over the head with features designed to hold the photographer's hand. This is about right.First, let me say what it doesn't have. I'd like some more control over basic functions, ISO, etc, but it does a good job of figuring out the best attributes for the shot -- I've yet to have a traditional \"bad\" shot on automatic. Panorama and macro modes are very solid, although the former I wouldn't recommend for anything beyond a basic landscape without a tripod.The only other issues I would have deal with the gearing of the lens, which sounds a little noisey. I don't have any issues with it, but I feel like a few years down the line there might be some issues with it sticking -- but by then I'll probably have a new camera, so it's not a big deal.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great purchase for the price.", "Author": "T.

Bell \"Rick\"", "ReviewID": "R2SW4C6LLI4JIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have two of these and overall I am quite satisfied with them.For the price I paid for these little cameras, they are not bad units.  The picture quality is pretty good.  Not as good as I would have expected from a 12MP camera, but quite acceptable.  In low light situations, the picture tends to become grainy looking.I have been able to capture some stunning sunset and cloud pictures with the camera mounted to a tripod.  Could use a little more bit-depth, but then this is not a 100-500+dollar camera.The videos are actually pretty good, seeing as this camera isn't necessarily designed as a video camera per-se.  The only thing I have found is that the audio can be a bit quirky sometimes.  It will be silent until a sound breaks a certain threshold.  Once that threshold is opened up, it will record audio.  It's kind of like a gate or something along that line.  Those into audio recording will understand the \"gate\" reference.  BTW, this audio anomaly is present on both of these cameras.Overall, I can recommend this camera for good general and everyday use.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Picture perfect", "Author": "charlie", "ReviewID": "RD365GDIX6FN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have bought 2 of this cameras before and i like it alot and it was really cheap on the price cant beat that i liked it a lot", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad flash delay and too slow to download pictures", "Author": "Jen D", "ReviewID": "RJ63ZKFMXGC17", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really dislike this camera, in fact it is the worst camera I have ever owned. These are the biggest reasons:1. When you take a flash picture there is such a long delay its almost like the ones that run off AA batteries.2. To set the mode (video, panorama, auto, etc.) you have to revolve this little dial around to the correct setting. However the dial doesn't work and even when its on video most of the time it just takes a picture. So you have to fiddle with this little dial trying to get it to think its on video, but by the time it \"gets it\" your video shot is over!3. It has seized up on me while filming several times. As in the video just freezes and you have to manually remove the battery to reset the camera, and your video file is lost as complete junk and unplayable.4. When transferring your pics to your computer it is soooooooooooo slow, in fact if there are more than about 100 pics on the memory card it refuses to budge at all, so I have to put the memory card in my other camera to transfer them. This happens even if the battery has just been charged completely.Anyway, do not buy this! The Nikon Coolpix I bought to replace it solved all of these problems.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for the price.", "Author": "Charmerci", "ReviewID": "R3VDR2XLD4N5WL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I guess excepting some of the quality control problems that some OTHER people have had giving this camera 1 star, I think it's a great camera for the price - especially since Amazon just dropped the price. (Though I haven't done any HD movie shots yet.) I've had zero problems with mine.Admittedly, I haven't tried out too many of the features on the camera. I just set the camera setting to N (natural ambiance) or N with the flash if needed and take photos. Works great and easily. I love its light weight. I've recently blown up some photos that I've changed quite a bit on the computer to 8x10 prints. I am very surprised by the high quality. (I used to take photos with old Nikon lenses in the 35mm format.) So much so, I'm not afraid of doing exhibitions with them.I guess I'm not too worried if the thing is perfect - if the photos' exposure isn't perfect, I don't really care because I just fine tune the good ones on the computer anyway. The great photographer Ansel Adams once said that 90% of the work that a photographer does is in the darkroom.The one tiny thing that bothers me the most is the miniature On/Off button.
