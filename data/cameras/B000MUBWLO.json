It is tiny and sleek - a perfect pocket camera. It is durable built and has a solid construction, I am sure it is gonna last for years. I would recommend this camera to anyone who is in market for a small sized camera.", "Date": "February 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "cute,works,screen is NOT dark", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1AZB6BWOT2610", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this digital camera is the best!well,ok,I guess it's not an 8 megapixel luxery model.but I can take it anywhere and it's durable (I know this because I've already dropped it once lol)(but I'm not saying that you can drop it whenever you like either)Anyway, all these other reveiws that say that the screen is too dark probably just got defective cameras or they are too picky!If the picture turns out dark its probably because they didn't have the flash on (you turn the flash on by pushing the up arrow)and if it's too bright when they do have the flash on it's because they are too close.Whenever you have the flash on the picture is always clear.Even if you keep moving the camera around!It also does videos with sound but when you watch the video on the camera you won't be able to here it even though it has a speaker on the side. but you can still watch it on the computer WITH sound.Sometimes when you take a picture without the flash it will end up blurry but not all the time.For example if I let my mom take the picture without flash (she doesn't really know how to work it that well) she will move the camera away too fast (you have to hold the camera still for a few seconds).Or if you are in the car and it's really bumpy the picture will turn out blurry.But when I take a picture of my hamster (she moves around alot)the picture will sometimes turn out blurry but I've taken alot of pictures of her that turn out great.Oh and when you watch a video on the computer the sound is good quality.I love this camera so much!I've even put little stick-on rhine stones on the front!This little camera is so cute!you just should keep it in a case since it doesn't have a lense cover.GREAT CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE SCREEN IS NOT THAT DARK!AND THE MONEY IS GOING TO A GOOD CAUSE!BUY IT!sorry if I misspelled anything. not a very good speller. :-)", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "E.

In fact, a mere two months later, I've had to buy a nicer camera. I guess one gets what they pay for.The display is so dark, it's nearly impossible to see what you're shooting at.

The LCD is very dark and its almost impossible to see what you are taking a photo of when you are inside the house.  I compared it to others at the store before returning it. It had about the darkest LCD in the there...I do think it takes good pictures for the most part.

Stephen", "ReviewID": "R21DWTI7U831OE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When you are deciding upon a digital camera, you have to take into consideration the subjects you want to capture.  What is this camera going to be used for?I have owned this camera for three years now.  I keep going back to it, thinking maybe those past incidents were just flukes.  Maybe the camera doesn't oversaturate every shot.  Maybe the flash doesn't completely wash out everything within 5 feet.  Maybe the sky really was cloudy that day, and the camera didn't just wash it out.  Maybe it was just too dark to take a picture without the hideously bright flash.But no.Every time I pick up the camera, I'm reminded of the mistake I made: buying a camera that looked fancy and benefited a good cause without doing any research.It takes okay shots outside in bright daylight, as long as you don't have any moving targets or contrasting subjects.  I never got a true color for the sky; even on days where there wasn't a cloud in sight, half the sky in the shot was white.With this camera, you can never take a close-up shot.  You can't take pictures inside.  You can't take pictures of things that move, since the shutter speed is very slow and the camera can't take any shake whatsoever.Buy yourself a better camera and donate $5.", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Horrible waste of money", "Author": "C. Jeffery", "ReviewID": "R1F7R7WV5920AO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my first digital camera that I bought without doing any research.  The first thing I noticed is that is was hard to review the pictures.  I had a hard time manipulating the menu.  I had to keep reviewing the manual.  The battery life is short even with auto turn off set to 2 minutes.  The LCD screen became increasingly dark to the point where it was impossible to see.  I took a few pictures anyway and they were very dark.  This is an awful camera.  As I do research for my next camera, I see other people have had lemons as well and were able to send them back.  Definitely buy a camera with a warranty and save the receipt until you've had the camera awhile and tested it in all lighting situations.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Cheap! the price says it all....", "Author": "Jill Paterson \"Jill\"", "ReviewID": "RP5XTHZBWDQH2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera for christmas and 4 months later it was already broken! I barely would use it too. The pictures looked horrible, you can never the lighting to look right.
