{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best outdoor camera for the bucks. Pretty easy to setup too!", "Author": "D. Leonardo", "ReviewID": "R2IR94H4OSM2IK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually don't write review on Amazon but I specifically want to spend some time to review this product. So, I was looking into an outdoor camera for my house, after much research, I decided to get Foscam for their quality and value. I saw in this review, there are a lot of people having problem setting up their camera which includes an IT guy. I'm myself an IT guy so I was kinda worry when I saw that kind of feedback from other IT guy.So after I order and received this camera, I got it working right away and set wireless, virtual server (port forwarding), giving dynamic DNS, etc. in about 30 mins. I don't even install the included software. Seems pretty straight forward to me. So here's the step I did.1. Plug the camera using the power supply to an outlet and the CAT5 cable to the back of your router.2. Go to your router backend (usually 192.168.0.1), login and see from status if there's a new device attached to it (the camera name itself as \"UNKNOWN\" or simply no name), you should see some IP like 192.168.0.101, etc.3. To test it, go to the IP you see on the browser ex. [...] - if it loads up then you are good!4. Then you login to the camera backend interface as \"admin\" with no password, from there I setup my WiFi5. You need to click scan twice in order to saw the access point list, once it show up, choose your connection and put in your WEP or WPA key if you have your WiFi secured then hit submit6. To test your WiFi, just disconnect the CAT5 cable and then the power supply then reconnect it again. Wait for a little while and go back to your router management website and see if there's any new Wireless device connected.7. Once you see the new wireless device, write down the IP and try to connect using your browser.8. After that you can use DHCP reservation to make sure your camera have static private IP. Remember: Wireless and Wired connection have different MAC address so make sure you reserve the correct one (you should be able to see the MAC address for wireless and wired at the back of your camera, top right is for wireless)9. Setup a virtual server / port forwarding so anytime you want to access the camera from the Internet anywhere in the world, you could do that. For example, forward any port 7000 to your camera IP ex. 192.168.0.101 and port 80. Then setup a dynamic DNS from your router so it will be easier to remember (most router should support it, I know my DIR-601 does). If not, then you can setup up the dynamic DNS within that camera itself.10. Setup your mail settings / FTP settings from the camera backend, remember you have to hit submit first after you enter the information BEFORE you can hit the test button.11. I have tried using motion detection and it send out to my email just fine.I guess that's it. I think it took me longer to write this review than setting up the camera but I hope you guys can learn more from this.Some people may deduct 1 start because the manual is almost useless and written with poor English. But any IT guy should be able to do it without even reading the manual. The product itself is great and the night vision is awesome (I just wish there's a switch to turn off the night vision so it doesn't show glowing red at night when I don't want to use it).", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Avoid this Camera", "Author": "AVSJ \"FlyingBlind\"", "ReviewID": "RPAUI86109S8B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I must say I've read all of the other reviews before purchasing this, so I was warned.  Unfortunately, I still had questions after reading the reviews and the only way to answer them was to have a camera in hand.THe FOSCAM camera brand is not all bad; the indoor cameras are quite worth the money and function superbly.  This OUTDOOR camera, however, is one to avoid.It wasn't particularly difficult to install.  All the other reviewers focus on the network setup.  I'll say only you have to know your way around your router to be able to make this work wirelessly.  No step-by-step procedures from me: they're avialable elsewhere.My complaint is twofold:  the design of the camera and the quality.As the camera is supposed to be an outdoor camera, I give it an \"F\" for design.  It has a huge tri-purpose cable leaving the back of the camera that cannot be disconnected from the camera.  On top of that, it has a massive ethernet jack at the end to plug in to the computer, a jack to connect the decidely INDOOR power supply and a reset button (all connected to the cable).  The idea is that you run this all-weather cable INTO your house and if you need to connect to it later you can do it.  My question is, How?I would rather have an easy way to DISCONNECT the cable from the camera and BRING IT INSIDE than have to haul a computer up to my attic to plug it in.  Also, I had to drill a 1.25 inch HOLE in the facia to get this monster connector through. Poor poor poor design.The second complaint is quality.  The camera is only 30 feet from the router yet it updates maybe every 3-5 seconds.  Not really video as much as a lot of stills.  It also has a very narrow field of view that, when mounted under the eaves of my two story house (all the way to the side of the house) it barely allows visibility to the front door stoop centered on the front of the house.  To cover my front door and the approach, I actually need 2 or 3 cameras.  Very disappointing.After having it only 2 weeks it also appears to be failing now - not connecting on the network despite many trip up to the attic to press the conveniently located \"reset\" button.The fact is, I ordered the two-pack of the camera and one is working like a champ (but 50% is still an 'F' in my book) - although it has inaccessible cable connection because of the difficulty in running the wire into the house (I actually have it connected to a LONG extension cord that hangs down the side of the house into a backyard socket - but I had to DUCT TAPE the indoor power supply to make it all weather.)I don't know the answer to your question of \"What kind of outdoor security camera should I buy\", because I'm still looking.  The FOSCAM Outdoor Camera didn't meet my expectations and unless you have VERY unique and convenient mounting requirements, you'll be disappointed too.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice cameras for the price", "Author": "G. Jeronowitz", "ReviewID": "RCHZ6P9DKUR4L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Setup requires you to connect via ethernet, and find the IP address of the camera (If you run windows, they provide a utility for this step). I had to access my router to get the IP address of the camera.The UI is fairly straightforward for setup, and is very responsive. It would be nice if the documentation described the APIs that are used on the camera to make settings changes so one could script them, but this isn't difficult to figure out if you know what you're doing (I needed to change the brightness settings from daytime to nighttime automatically).The mounts supplied with the cameras get the job done, but are a little flimsy, relying on friction from drawing two opposing plates together against a ball joint to prevent movement. I had to use a small pliers to get the mount to a point where it was not moving.While the housing itself seems quite weatherproof, there are several connectors that hang off the unit, ethernet, reset, sound, power, and I am unclear as to the suitability of those connectors to weather exposure.  In my application, however, I can get those connectors to a dry place.The antennas on these units are fixed at a right angle. They can only be adjusted by rotating the mounting nut. There are other brands of this type of camera that allow the mounting nut to be fully tightened but still allow the antenna to rotate on two axis for best signal strength.The IR emitters are quite bright, but are narrowly focused.  With the 6mm lens that shipped with my cameras (I was expecting the 3.6mm lenses) the field of view would be completely illuminated by the emitters.  With the 2.8mm lenses I have since installed in the units, there is a very distinct illuminated circle in the center  of my image at night. This is no fault of the camera, as the 2.8mm lens is well outside the design parameters of the camera.For me, the cameras shipped with outdated firmware. Foscam's website has an update available but to get it you must enter your email address and sign up for their newsletter via email; they then email you the links to the firmware update.  Seems kind of scummy to me, firmware updates should be freely downloadable from the website without having to agree to get newsletter spam.Cameras that do what these do, from brand name sources, cost upwards of $300 and don't have much better image quality from what I've seen.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "this camera is good", "Author": "E.

Actually this outdoor model decent resolution and accurate colors, the picture on the package does reflect what to expect, assuming adequate ambient light.  Every now and then, the camera will flicker and the colors will go crazy for 1-5 minutes, it happens once or twice a week, not sure whyBottom light: Buy WIFI  I have experimented with several different brands and models of security cameras in the past few years, most of them are now in my junk drawer, WIFI this is by far the best design ..within my +/- $100 budget. The best as far as picture quality and ease of setupPros: reliable, looks sturdy, meets my basic needs, the first camera I configured over a year ago, and it has been pretty reliable. Another pro: phone APPS: IPHONE, IPAD and drone apps, tried several, they do work wellCons:  this fat pig tail with reset button, internet and power connection is awkward, I will use a junction box to hide it and to protect it from the elements.

I am a scientist.  I have never set up a wireless IP camera before...and just got a smartphone last month.  So, you could say a am truly a newb in the wifi world.That said... each of those models have been great.  I struggled with getting the cameras to go wireless, and did contact customer service at foscam (several were purchased through foscam, several through amazon).  They were helpful, but couldn't get them to work either.  I finally found the silly error we were making (my fault) and now they are working perfectly.  Now I can get a new camera to go wireless and recording out of the box within 5min.  It takes longer to find a spot to mount than it does to set up.  The Blue Iris software is a great additional purchase from foscam and helps with all the quirks in recording, etc... and think that is a must with these cameras.In order to set these up, you will need to know your router's username/password...your SSID, your shared key, and your security settings.  You will need to port forward (and/or set up as a virtual server).  Foscam will help if you purchase directly from them, but the instructions are outlined very clearly in the manuals.The 905 has a much longer range of sensitivity (than the 904)...which is longer than even the mega bright IR lights will reach at night.  But as a result it has a much narrower angle of coverage...even when I pull back the protective rain shield.  I would definitely recommend this camera for long range purposes.See also my other reviews for the other models I mentioned.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review", "Author": "Stephen Campbell \"Author\"", "ReviewID": "R2EDQ6BJ7VQFZ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The good:It is well made for the price.

The software that it ships with is easy to use and you can get the wired version working quickly.The daytime picture is *** good. Within 15 feet you could easily do a facial recognition.  At 400 feet you can tell its a person and a dog walking by.The Bad:You must have an older router or one that can be rolled back to 801g/h. I have an N series and it can't be rolled back so now I need to figure how I want to do wireless.  Check your router first!  You'll need to assign static IP's too.Also the power cord is too short as are the network cables.  Maybe 5 ft. on the cable and 3 ft for the power.

You have to make sure you keep up on the firmware updates to fix issues though. They are constructed of generic components that I am pretty sure used by many other camera manufacturers, so the only thing that differentiates them is their price and firmware. There have been firmware issues since the beginning, and in many instances I had to troubleshoot my own issues, and then posted the solution on their forums for others to read. At this point, I am on firmware revision .53 and the only remaining issue is an issue of how it detects light changes. There is a setting that is supposed to compensate for differences in light (clouds going overhead, etc) so that it doesn't detect light changes as motion, but it doesn't work. Apparently though, there is a component update available that requires some DIY electronic work that will fix it (also, supposedly the ones being sold now already have the fix in place). You can also use some window tint as a make shift shade on the lens to help. I use these in a remote location and have utilized both the email and ftp alerting options. Both work equally well.

(simply cutting a exact sized donut shape ring from wax paper and taping it will do.) one problem i came a cross is a wiring issue the size of the ethernet plug on the cord is 1/2in diagonal meaning you will probably need to drill/cut a decent size hole just to wirer it through a wall or ceiling. i didn't cut the zip tie that came around the cord and i bundled it in a plastic bag then secured it under the eave so the only hole i needed was just big enough for the power cord. which it is substantially smaller. another problem i came across is the adapter went out on that camera. i ordered a cheaper after-market adapter (cos the foscam one is too expensive) and am back up and running. overall, i like foscam cameras they are reasonably priced and thus-far worth every penny.as for the HD models i would wait... i've seen where some apps don't support them. (too much bandwidth needed)oh, and update the firmware first then the user interface before you install cam. both are easy to do and free of charge once you get emailed the download links.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tech Help - A+++", "Author": "LeAnn", "ReviewID": "R2I1NCBWA41L61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Could not of done it with Andrew and his technical help ~ MANY thanks!!!

I called foscam and although I waited on hold for quite a long time (prepare to be on hold for atleast 30 min), I received wonderful help from a tech named Leo.  He remote entered into my computer and fixed the issue at hand (both cams had the same IP address).  I am no tech wizard, but their helpful computer gurus can help you through any problem.I bought these cameras for my father for christmas.  I did a ton of research about wireless security cameras before purchasing and decided that these seemed like the best quality for the money.  I was apprehensive about the installation of these units because of the reviews.  I am relatively computer savvy, but I don't know much about port forwarding and static IP addresses.  The directions are not the best.  They are super universal, and if you don't have a linksys router, you may find yourself lost very easily.  I set up these two cameras on a ATT Uverse router.  I got about 3/4 of the way through the installation on my own, following the directions included in the package and various googled forum posts on the topic.  I went to set up the second foscam cam on my system and it caused the first camera to go black.  I couldn't figure out what I did wrong, so I admitted defeat and called FOSCAM US tech support.I waited on hold for about 20 minutes, but I was eventually connected with a nice guy by the name of Felix.  I told Felix what I had done (and hadn't done), and he told me he would help me.  Rather than simply answer my questions about what I had done wrong and needed to change, he remotely connected into my computer and fixed the issues and finished the entire setup for me while I watched on the screen.  He was extremely helpful and professional.  Felix could have simply answered my question and sent me on my way since I did not buy any installation help from FOSCAM, but he went above and beyond to help me understand how to connect these up so I can now confidently add on more cameras to this system in the future.I did not realize the level of technical knowledge needed to set these up, but foscam tech support was very thorough and helped me complete the setup.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to be able to watch their business or home from away. It is a well built camera and my experience with their tech is nothing like some of the problematic reviews I've seen below.A few words of advice for those having issues remotely connecting into their cameras:  I initially tried to use port 80 and 85 for my two cameras, but Foscam tech ended up using ports 8088 and 8089, which allowed me to easily set up the foscam pro app on my cell phone as well.Please do not be afraid of these cameras if you have any sense of IP addresses, port forwarding, and firewalls.

I guess my only complaint would be they don't have the PAN option, but I knew that before I purchased them. I am an IT Professional and I realize that non-IT oriented folks may not be very familiar with the setup at first as it seems confusing. Foscam includes a video tutorial on each step of configuring any of their camera's. If you use this video, anyone can install and configure these camera's in 10-20 minutes. Follow the video and don't skip steps!! The mounting was easy and the picture is acceptable for my needs. The units were a little larger than I expected... maybe they make smaller versions of this item?? Anyway, the IP viewing from a browser or IPAD/IPHONE works great, no complaints there. Since I have routing experience and work with remote security at my job, it was a little easier for me to setup this feature, but again, watch the video and these features will be explained in detail.The APP is $6, but well worth it as it has many options/features available.

I've got 2 Foscam indoor cameras and have been happy with the image quality (although the build quality has been so-so).When I received these cameras, I was really surprised by how large they are. They are big. Much too big to mount under an eave on a house and have them go unnoticed.Another complaint is the field of view. In order to use these to keep an eye on my front/back foors, I'd have to mount them very high and/or quite a long ways distance from both doors since the field of view is quite narrow. While testing, I had the camera set up 20 feet away from my desk pointed at my desk. The image was quite clear (even in low-light) but I barely fit my desk and myself into the field of view.I liked the image quality but not really much else about these cameras. They are large and bulky. The mounts that were shipped with the cameras were a joke and wouldn't even hold the weight of the cameras.  The field of view might be OK if you are using it to watch a specific area a good distance from mount point but they aren't useful for close-up monitoring of a wide area.Overall, 2 stars out of 5.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "The two cameras I bought from Amazon are great camera.
