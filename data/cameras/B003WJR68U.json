Also any new links are posted in the first comment following this review.I have posted a PDF file with all the tips and tricks and important information about this camera on page 68 and comment 672 (2nd one down on page 68) of the comments section following this review.  There is a Table of Contents to easily find pages for a variety of topics.  The Custom settings are in the PDF on pages 34-36.  It makes all the difference in this camera.  It will shoot well in low light areas using the CUSTOMIZED settings.  Get it and print it out for future reference!The comments about this camera not working well in low light in video and in photos is over.  It is just a matter of changing the settings in the camera.  It does much better in lower light now.  See comments 627 on page 63 of the comments following this review!  The comments area in general is packed with good information about tips for better shooting and products to buy to make the process better.  Check them out!First, let me tell you I have read every single review about this camera on the Amazon website.  I was torn between this camera and the Canon SX30IS 14.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 Inch Wide LCD and the new Fujifilm FinePix HS20 16 MP Digital Camera with EXR BSI CMOS High Speed Sensor and Fujinon 30x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens.  I also looked at the Fujifilm FinePix HS10 10 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 30x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD, but didn't like it because after the picture was taken it takes 3-4 seconds to process before another picture can be taken.  I currently own the Panasonic DMC-FZ35 as well, and used it as a comparison camera with the DMC-FZ100.  I am still in the process of comparing photos of both cameras with the settings exactly the same, and so far the FZ100 wins.This camera has a an excellent 25mm Ultra Wide-Angle Lexica DC Vario-Elmarit lens w 24X optical zoom, high speed Venus Engine 3 core processor, full HD movie recording at 1920 X 1080 resolution at 60 frames per second, High Speed Video recording at 220 frames per second, the fastest level of burst shooting of any bridge camera at 2,5,11 (2, 5,and 11 fps at full 14mp resolution),40, and 60 fps,  shutter release lag of 0.008 seconds (WOW!), 14 mp resolution, and the camera's quick response makes it easier to capture sudden, spur-of-the-moment photo opportunities together with the Sonic Speed AF (auto focus). Thanks to newly incorporated Intelligent Resolution technology, with the Intelligent Zoom turned on, the DMC-FZ100 has a camera zoom range of 1 - 32X, or a 35mm camera equivalent of 25-780mm at maximum 14mp picture size!  No one makes a camera like this one!  No one even comes close!I have been in photography for many years.  I've done wedding photography and sold some of my photos on line and to some local shops.  I had a photography studio in my basement.  I currently use a Nikon D90 as a DSLR camera.  I enjoy the ease of taking a bridge camera with me instead of hauling the huge camera and bag full of lenses.  I use the Panasonic cameras strictly for taking photos for myself as the quality is not the same as with the Nikon D90. Don't get me wrong.  It takes a great picture!  But you just can't compare a bridge camera to a DSLR.  You can't compare the price either.  MY D90 cost me almost $1000 and the lenses are just as expensive.  Some cost way more than the camera body.  Have you bought a 25-780mm lens for a DSLR camera lately?  If they were available they would cost thousands of dollars!  That's the lens equivalent of the Panasonic DMC-FZ100 with I-Zoom ON!The Panasonic DMC-FZ100 is getting a lot of negative reviews about picture quality.  I decided to buy the camera anyway and see if it could be useful to me.  I liked the 35X zoom of the Canon SX30IS, but there are lots of negative reviews concerning its picture quality as well.  The Panasonic DMC-FZ100 has many qualities and features that puts it above the Canon, but the 35X really pulled on me.  I will explain the qualities of the FZ100 in a minute.  The new Fujifilm Finepix HS20 really caught my eye!  The main reason I decided against that camera is the zoom is manual and the price tag is much higher than the FZ100.  The zoom being manual makes any video jerky while it is being zoomed.  I looked at some of the videos taken with it on YouTube.  Just do a search on that site.The PDF manual for this camera can be downloaded from the Panasonic web site. Just do a search for it in Google.  I put the link for the PDF in the comments section in case you want to download it.I gave the camera an in depth checkout and came away totally pleased with it.  Let me tell you all the benefits and features of this great camera:What I like:It has threads for filters.  It takes a 52mm filter and they are readily available. Zeikos makes a 52mm polarizing filter Zeikos ZE-CPL52 52mm Multi-Coated Circular Polarizer Filter.  I bought one for my FZ35 a while back.  I also bought a more expensive Hoya polarizing filter and cannot see any difference between the Zeikos filter and the Hoya filter.  Save your money and get the Zeikos.The lens hood is included and uses a slot instead of screwing on.  It is much faster to install or remove.Some of the above cameras charge extra for the lens hood.The camera takes JPG or Raw pictures or Both.In the Video Mode, single still pictures or burst pictures can be taken just by pressing down on the shutter release button while taking the video.  It takes a 3.5mp picture or pictures, up to 40 per video. To set up the burst mode just select it on top of the camera next to the main dial and set it up before taking the video.  Page 110 in the manual.In the Video Mode you can normally zoom to 24X. However if you select and turn on I-Zoom the camera will zoom to 32X.  I-Zoom gives you 1.3X the normal zoom.  The setting also gives you 32X in the Picture Mode (at 14mp picture size).  It makes the camera in both picture mode and video mode equivalent to a 35mm camera 25-780mm lens! The picture quality in video or photo is not diminished in this mode. It says it on page 58 and 145 in the manual.To turn I-Zoom on, just go to Menu, REC MENU, Page 3 (Change pages up by moving the zoom switch right, and down by moving the zoom switch left) , select I.R I.Resolution, then select I Zoom.  After that, when using the Video Mode, instead of zooming to 24X, the camera will zoom to 32X.  In the picture mode, the zoom goes from 24X in the 14mp Mode to 32X.  If you set the camera in the 10mp picture size, the zoom goes from 24X to 37.9X.  Now the camera is actually zooming in more than the Canon SX30IS!  The best part!  Using the I Zoom and Extended Optical Zoom does not degrade picture quality at all!  Go to the manual on page 58 and 145.  It tells you that right in the manual!I-Zoom = Multiplier of 1.3XExtended Optical Zoom with I-Zoom ON14mp = 32X10mp = 37.9X7mp = 45X5mp = 54X3mp = 67.4XI used the camera at 3mp (67.4X) with the Olympus 1.7 teleconverter to get a total zoom of 118X, and took a picture of the moon with just a monopod.  It filled the whole screen without cropping.  It can be seen at the web site listed in comments.  The picture looks great!  I will be taking another with a tripod when the moon is full, and will post it as well.The camera has a live Histogram which the FZ35 has as well.  To turn it on, go to MENU, SETUP, Page 3, HISTOGRAM, and turn it ON.The camera will take 5 quick flash shots!  To do that, just put the top main dial to SCN Mode, and select FLASH BURST, which is on the second row!  The FZ35 does that too.  While we are in the SCN Mode, in a dim setting like inside at night, select the CANDLE LIGHT Mode,  It really brightens up the picture!  Better yet, at night in tough lighting, select iA Mode (Intelligent Auto) with the camera main dial.  It does a great job in dim light, but you will sacrifice some noise!  Also note in SCN mode, go to the second page of the menu and select HS Mode for High Speed Video to take those fast action videos that you want to get great slow motion detail in.  The speed is 220 frames per second!460,000 pixel 3 inch LCD, which extends and swivels.  You can even take a picture of yourself and see what it is going to look like before you take the shot.  Just extend the screen and rotate it 180 degrees.DIFFERENT COLOR MODES = Page 132 of manualThe camera has several different color modes.STANDARD:  The standard settingDYNAMIC: The saturation and contrast are increased.NATURE: Brighter red, green and blue.  Enhanced beauty of nature.SMOOTH: The contrast is lowered for smoother and clearer color.VIBRANT :  Higher saturation and contrast than DYNAMIC.  Makes the colors snap out at you!There are a couple of others.To Set the COLOR MODE go to P or A or S or M mode on the main dial, press MENU, then FILM MODE, then push the right button on the MENU SET switch to cycle through the various color modes. Once in a mode, scroll down and set the CONTRAST, SHARPNESS, SATURATION, and NOISE REDUCTION.  Once set, press the MENU button again to save it.By going to the FILM MODE (MENU, REC MODE, Page 1, FILM MODE)  you are able to customize your setting of CONTRAST, SHARPNESS, SATURATION, and NOISE REDUCTION and set it on a custom menu.  Just select your settings and continue scrolling down to Memory and set your custom menu there.It has a flash shoe, and uses Panasonic Flashes.  There are three to choose from but they can get real expensive! Panasonic DMW-FL360 External Flash (GN36) for Panasonic L1 DSLR and FZ50 Digital Camera, Panasonic DMW-FL500 TTL External Flash for Panasonic L1 DSLR and FZ50 Digital CameraAVCHD Video, either 1080i, or 720p, 60 frames per second, or Motion JPEG. The video in 1080 or 720 AVCHD can be processed and played in Windows 7 Media Player and does not skip or flicker.  The video is very clear and looks outstanding.  Also there is no time limit in these AVCHD modes in the camera.  It will take the video till the memory card is full.I have read on some reviews that the video is jumpy and simply not good.  This is because they are probably using older computers.  I had this problem with my old computer as well. It would not play HD at all and some of the higher settings of regular video would be jumpy and not good.  This is because your computer is just not fast enough to play HD video.  First of all, you need a HD video monitor.  You need a good fast graphics card and a fast computer.  If it doesn't play on your computer it is not the camera's fault. This camera has outstanding HD video.  It simply looks awesome!  Windows 7 Media Player works great with AVCHD movie files.Can use teleconverter lenses with adapter Lens Adapter, which allows use of 55mm lenses. Olympus TCON-1.7x Telephoto Converter LensCan use External Mike if neededBURST MODEThe selector is on top of the camera, next to the Main Dial.It allows selection of 2 fps (frames per second), 5 fps, 11 fps, 40 fps, or 60 fps.  In 40 and 60 fps the camera uses an electronic shutter, not a mechanical one.  It uses a mechanical shutter on all speeds 11 fps and under.  At 40 fps, the picture size is 5M and at 60 fps the picture size is 3.5m.  The camera will take 5 fps pictures with continuous Auto Focus!I was able to take 15 pictures straight in just over a second at the picture size of 14mp in the 11 fps mode.  In the 40 and 60 fps mode the camera sounds like a high tech machine gun!  WOW!Picture QualityThere has been a lot written about the poor picture quality of this camera and I checked it out thoroughly.  First of all, I usually set the ISO to manual and set it to 100.  That is where you will always get the best picture.  I did the same for my FZ35.  If used in ISO Auto, I would set the limit to ISO 400.  These cameras are noisy if you let the ISO get up too high.  This camera is not any worse or better than the FZ35.  I took some pictures inside at night with available lighting.  The first pictures I took in the iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode.  The pictures looked all right, but were noisy.  The second set of pictures I took was in Aperture Priority with the aperture set to maximum (f/2.8) and they look a lot cleaner with much less noise.  The ISO was set to 100. If you want the best possible pictures set the ISO low and use either P (Program) or A (Aperture) or S (Shutter)  or M (Manual) Modes.  It is the same with the FZ35.  No different there.I did a test.  I took one picture in the iA mode and the second in the A (Aperture) Mode, with the Aperture set to maximum , which was f/3.4 at zoom 3X.  The picture in Aperture Mode had a lot less noise.  I posted the pictures on line and the link to see them is in the comments section.The bottom line:  The FZ100 takes a great picture!  Just use one of the priority modes and keep your ISO low.  The pictures are in some ways better than the pictures I took with the FZ35.  The colors of the FZ100 look more accurate than the FZ35.  I compared these pictures pixel peeping like mad, blowing up the pictures a lot to see the difference.  I like the FZ100 pictures better.  Just look at the writing on top of the drill or the SKIL logo on the screwdriver.  Next to the SKIL logo is a trademark R.  Can't read it in the FZ35 picture.  Look at the drill bits.  They look way sharper in the FZ100 picture.  Check it out for yourself.  Don't believe what I say.  Make your own determination.  Go to the link in the comments section, which takes you to flickr, blow up the pictures to original size and judge for yourself.  The only way I could judge one camera's pictures over the other is to blow them way up.  At normal picture size there is no way you could pick one over the other .  There just isn't that much difference.  Some people are saying they can see the difference in quality.  I don't see it and fail to see how they could see any difference in quality between these two cameras at a normal picture display size with both cameras set up exactly the same way. The pictures are definitely more noisy in the iA mode even with the ISO set to 100.Check out other FZ100 pictures on the flickr website.  Just go there and do a search for the PANASONIC DMC-FZ100.  There are bunches of great photos.  Some of them are simply stunning! Some of the insect pictures are amazing!The camera has excellent stabilization.  I was able to take great clear (not blurry) hand held pictures of a sign, at about 100 yards away in my yard.  The camera set to 10mp and the zoom set at 37.9, and it was a late afternoon on a sunny day.If you use this camera to print 8X10 photos, there is really no need to set the picture size for any higher than 10mp.  As a matter of fact the camera says if you print 8 X 10, the recommended setting is 5mp.  I used to print excellent quality 8 X 10 and larger pictures with a 6mp DSLR camera.  In the camera at 14mp mode, it says that size is for prints 16 X 20 inches.  For 10mp the size is 11 X 14 inches.FLASHSet the flash to come on any time the flash is opened.  That way when you need or want a flash just press the flash button to open the flash .  A lot of times it is proper to use the flash even during the day to fill in shadows.  Go to MENU, REC MODE, MENU 4, FLASH, and select the one with only the flash icon.  (by the way, to change from one page to the next in MENU, just pull the zoom lever to the right.  Each time you pull it right it will advance one page.  To go down,  pull the zoom lever to the left).Turn on the Continuous AF Mode in the Motion Picture (video) Mode.  To do this, go to MENU, MOTION PICTURE, CONTINUOUS AF, and select ON.  That way it will focus as you zoom.I noticed the pictures reviewed on the LCD with flash look dim when viewed, but they look fine with my picture software.  I don't know why this happens.The Olympus TCON 1.7X converter works best when the camera is zoomed to 7X to the max of 37.9X in the 10mp mode.  You have to be zoomed to about 7X or more to stop the vignetting.WHAT I DON\"T LIKE:I don't like having to buy Panasonic Batteries at $60 a pop.  It ticks me off that they don't allow aftermarket batteries to be used.  I had that problem with my FZ35 as well till I downloaded and installed a earlier firmware version.  I did order one battery from Ebay from a Hong Kong dealer for cheap.  I will post if it works.I also don't like the REAR DIAL on the camera.  It seems cheap and doesn't work all that well.  It seems to turn hard and if you push on it a little bit it changes the mode on you.I like the camera bag, Case Logic SLCC-2 Deluxe Camcorder Case, Color: Black and Silver.  It is big enough to hold the camera, the lenses, the batteries, the charger and still room to spare.  The price is reasonable.Well, that's it.  Check out my pictures.  I will leave the link in the comments section.  I am overjoyed at this camera!  It is awesome!Update:  1-19-11 I took pictures with the FZ35 and the FZ100 today and posted them on flickr.  Its hard to pick a winner.  The color in the FZ100 photos looks better.  The higher zoomed pictures with the FZ100 really stand out.  Be advised I took those pictures hand held.  I probably should have used a tripod or monopod.  Check them out for yourself.  I left the link in the first comments section.  It is on the bottom of the first comment. I took a moon shot of the full moon and it is posted in the same place with the comparison pictures.Update 1-22-11.  Someone sent me an email and asked my why I chose the Panasonic over the Canon.  Here's why: I considered both cameras, but here is why I chose the Panasonic. The Canon zooms to 35X and that was important to me. The Panasonic zoomed to 24X, which was a downer. I use video a lot and didn't like that at all. In doing the research on the Panasonic camera I read about I-Zoom, which when turned on makes the zoom in video and 14mp picture mode go to 32X. That leveled the playing field for me for the Panasonic. The Canon does not take video in true HD mode. It only takes video in 1920 X 720 at 30 frames per second. The Panasonic takes true HD video in 1920 X 1080 at 60 frames per second.  Plus it has a high speed video mode in which it takes 220 frames per second.  Both cameras use the 14mp sensor, which degrades picture quality somewhat, so a draw there. The Panasonic uses a 460,000 pixel LCD and the Canon uses a 230,000 pixel LCD screen. The flash recycle time on the Canon is 10 seconds. On the Panasonic it is almost instant.  In fact you can put the camera in the flash burst mode and take 5 really quick flash shots.  The killer for me is the Panasonic takes up to 11 pictures per second in the 14mp picture mode and 5 pictures per second in full auto focus mode. The Canon is a deadbeat here. It takes 1.3 shots per second in the normal mode and 0.6 frames per second with auto focus on. Soooooo Slooooowwww! Another reason I didn't take the Canon is the picture mode goes from 14mp to the next size down, which is 7mp. What happened to 10mp?  The next picture size after that is 2mp.  So disappointing. Another thing, the Panasonic Aperture goes from f/2.8 to f/11 and the Canon is f/2.7 to f/8. All those reasons is why I chose the Panasonic over the Canon, and don't regret it one bit. The Panasonic is simply the better camera!Update 1-23-11.  I posted a full HD 1920 X 1080 video on YouTube showing the full 32X zoom with I-Zoom turned on.  The link is at the bottom of the first comment.Update 1-24-11.  I discovered something very important about the camera this morning.  I tried to take HD video inside and it seems the picture is always dark in the video mode.  I had the camera in Aperture Priority and had the f/ stop set at f/2.8.  I don't know if it makes any difference in video recording.  I tried setting the ISO to 1600 to make the video lighter, but it did not help.  Finally I got an idea.  I put the camera in iA (Intelligent Auto) mode and pushed the video record.  What a difference!!!!  WOW!!!!  Now the video is light and looks great inside in low light conditions!  So, if you plan on taking a video inside, put the main dial in iA first.  It makes a world of difference!  That is not in the manual by the way.  iA does introduce noise when the lighing is low, but I would rather have some noise in my video and be able to see the action than to have a clean picture that's too dark to watch.One note:  AVCHD HD Video (the video this camera uses) is downloadable directly to YouTube without any conversion.  That's nice to know.  Many other tips and comments are in the comments section of this review.You want to know why your pictures look crappy?  You are probably in iA Mode (Intelligent Auto).  Check the settings in iA mode on page 51 and 52 of the manual.  The ISO is preset (and not adjustable) to Intelligent ISO (The ISO sensitivity is adjusted according to the movement of the subject and the brightness), and the MAX ISO SENSITIVITY is preset (and not adjustable) to ISO 1600 (ISO 6400 if MOTION DEBLUR is set to ON!). It's no wonder your pictures are so crappy!  Red Eye removal is ON.  Zoom Mike is ON.  The High ISO Limit is why you are getting crappy pictures.  Get out of the iA mode and go to one of the priority (P, A, S, M) modes of the camera.  If you are new to photography or just don't want to mess with the camera, just set it in P (Program) mode.  The camera will select shutter speed and ISO for you.  Push the MENU button and set the ISO to AUTO if you wish, and set the ISO LIMIT to 400.  To get the best pictures set the ISO to 100 and not to AUTO.  Your pictures will look great and will not be noisy.  The best part is you will find yourself really liking this camera!  Use the iA mode when you need to take a shot and it was dark and nothing else that you tried worked or you didn't have time to experiment.  If you need the to take the shot quick set the camera to iA mode, especially in bad lighting.  The camera will take the shot.  It will be noisy but it will take the shot.Update 1-27-11  Posted 6 new comparison shots of the FZ35 and FZ100 camera.  The link is posted at the bottom of the first comment.Update 1-30-11  You can save a still picture while in the video playback mode.  To do that, play the video back and view it on the LCD.  Pause the video at the point that you want the picture (to pause, hit the top button on the MENU Set toggle switch).  Press the MENU button.  It asks you \"Save this image?\"  Press YES and you are there.  SO easy!  It saves the picture in the 2mp picture size on a HD or WVGA video. Page 159 in the manual.I just ordered a macro lens Raynox DCR 150 - Converter for this camera.  When it comes in I will let you know how well it works.  Some of the photos taken in flickr with this lens are SIMPLY STUNNING!Update 1-31-11  I got the Raynox DCR-150 macro lens in today and all I can say is WOW!  It attaches directly to the camera lens.  The macro is way way way better and stronger than the macro that comes with the camera.  I have posted the link to some pictures I took with it at the bottom of the first comment.  HAPPY HAPPY!  This lens just knocks it out of the park!Update 2-1-11  Oh, one thing I forgot to tell you.  If you copy all the picture files on your SDHC card to your computer and want to get rid of them, never format the card in your computer. Formatting the card in your computer can corrupt the card and it will not work in your camera anymore.  Your computer uses NTFS format and your camera uses FAT32.  I have several articles that explain such and will post the links in the first comment area if anyone wants to see them.  Always format the SDHC card in the camera.  The quickest way to format the card is to go to MENU, scroll down to SETUP, go to PAGE 6 (just turn the zoom lever left two times to go to PAGE 6), scroll down to FORMAT, and push the right button on your MENU toggle switch and select YES to \"Delete All Data From the Memory Card\". I also recommend you back up your pictures to a different hard drive for safe keeping.  I use a USB hard drive that holds 1.5 Tera bites (1500 Mega Bites).  They are fairly inexpensive and can save your butt if your hard drive ever fails.  I know.  I lost 3000 pictures one time because the computer power supply crashed and took out both my computer hard drives. I had my pictures backed up on both drives.  It really hurt! If you go on a long extended trip it is worth it to back up your cards to a card drive.  A really good one is a Nexto DI NEXTO eXtreme3 500GB Digital Hi-Speed OTG Backup Storage.  Mine holds 500 mega bites.  I used it while on vacation in Vietnam for about 3 weeks.  I took over 7000 pictures and over 500 videos.  This brand of card reader is not cheap, but it is worth every penny.  It's really fast too.Update 2-3-11 I just got a new flash for the camera. It is a Vivitar DF-383. It works great with the FZ100 camera. It works in the TTL mode and shows camera aperture, ISO setting, F/stop, and zoom in mm. It can be used as a slave and has a power saving function. It is a powerful flash (Guide number (ISO 100) 45 meters/148 feet at 85mm position). It also shuts off when the camera is powered down. I posted some photos on Flickr from the flash.  The item was 25 feet away and was shot in Aperture Priority, ISO 100 at different zoom settings.  The link is at the bottom of the first comment.Update 2-9-11  A friend of mine just told me about a remote shutter release cable that you can hook up to the camera to take macro or telephoto shots without camera shake. It is so much easier than setting the timer to take the picture every time. He bought his on Ebay. Amazon has the Panasonic cord, but it is really expensive.  Panasonic DMW-RSL1 Remote Shutter Release. Here is a much cheaper alternative from Amazon. I will post the link to the product in the first comment.Update 2-13-11  This is a big time update!  I have found that taking HD video inside at night to be pretty disappointing with the FZ100.  I took some video in HD with my FZ35 and it looks good.  It is plenty bright enough.  The FZ100 if set in HD 1080 or 720 the video is really dark.  I tried setting the ISO higher. No help.  I tried just about everything without any success.  The only solution is to set the camera in iA mode.  The picture is much brighter, but full of noise.Well, I found a solution!  This makes it much better!  Set the camera RECORD MODE to MOTION JPG and REC QUALITY to HD and set the ISO to 400.  Wow what a difference!  It is soooooooo much better and brighter.  It is about the same as my FZ35.  The only problem with MOTION JPG is it will only record 8 minutes in this mode.  If you choose the WVGA mode instead of HD it will record for 20 minutes. It may not be the best solution but it will allow good videos in low light at night.Update 2-22-11.  I just read an article that says the NOISE REDUCTION is one reason the picture quality on the FZ100 is not as good.  It says to shut the Noise Reduction down.  Here is how you do that:Go to one of the shooting modes other than iA. Go to A priority for example. Push the Menu Set button. Select FILM MODE (top one on page 1).  Change your mode by pushing the button on the right of the menu set switch. I have mine on VIBRANT. Select whatever mode you want. Then move the highlighter down to Contrast (I use +1), SHARPNESS (I use +1), VIBRANT (I use +1) and NOISE REDUCTION (I use -2). Then push the menu set again and that's it. Turn the NOISE REDUCTION as low as it will go as it will screw up your picture quality.Update 2-24-11  This comment is going to be about the Vivitar Flash (external flash) on the FZ100. The FZ40 will never get pictures like the ones I am posting because it has no hot shoe and no external flash can be used. The pictures with the camera flash are the only pictures the FZ40 will ever get. Those who have the FZ100, get ready for a pleasant surprise. I took 6 photos. 3 with the camera flash and 3 with the Vivitar DF-383. The first set was at a zoom of 1X. The second set used a zoom of 24X at 30 feet, and the last set was zoomed at 37.9X, and about 38 feet away from the object. The camera was set to Aperture Priority and ISO 100. Feast your eyes on this:  Go to the bottom of the first comment for the link.Update 3-15-11.  I know this camera has gobs of zoom, but can you ever get enough?  I have the Olympus TCON 1.7X teleconverter.  Today I got the Raynox 2.2X teleconverter and did a comparison between the two.  If you are a birder or do long range photography you might want to check out this comparison.  The explanation and the link to Flickr is in the bottom of my first comment.Update 3-27-11.  I tried using the lens hood a couple of times and didn't like the way it fit.  It seemed the fit was loose.  After just reading another comment from another review, I tried the lens hood again.  This time I turned it a little harder and it clicked.  When it clicks it is going to stay put and will not come off.  The best part is you can mount the lens hood backwards on the camera.  Once again, make sure it clicks.  It will not come off by itself.  The lens hood in this way will always be with the camera, ready to use, but not in the way of adding filters or close up lenses or polarizing filters.Noise reduction.  This camera needs noise reduction software when taking shots with high ISO.  See my bottom of the 1st comment about that to see how great these programs work.Photo FlashIn taking a flash with the built in flash, the camera tends to go up in ISO instead of increasing the flash power which gives very bad picture full of noise. It is therefore important to lock the ISO sensitivity.  I would set the ISO to no more than 400, and preferably to 100 and increase the flash power, you see the pictures will be 100 times better. To increase the flash power, set the camera in Aperture Priority (any of the 4 main priorities), push the button above the MENU SET button. If you push it one time it goes to EXPOSURE, push it again and it goes to AUTO BRACKET, push it again and it goes to FLASH. Set the flash to anything from 0.1 to +2 for more power. It makes a big difference! Set it up that way and take a couple of shots and see for yourself. Go ahead, try it out on your camera right now. Take a shot at +1 and another at +2. Don't forget to set it back to its original position when done. Back to exposure. If the pictures look too dark, also increase the EXPOSURE.Update 4-21-11  A feature that I find invaluable about this camera is the ability to save a picture from a video shot with the camera.  What a great feature to have!  You shoot a video and find yourself wanting a snapshot of something in the video.  You can get that picture!  Just play the video back in the camera, and at the point or near the point where you want the snapshot, hit the pause button (the button on top of the MENU SET button).  Once paused, you can move forward or backwards by pushing the button to the right and to the left of the MENU SET button.  Once you are at the point where you want the picture, push the MENU SET button.  It will ask SAVE THIS IMAGE?  Highlight YES, and it is done.  I will save the picture at a small picture size of 2.0mp.Update 5-8-11.  Don't connect the camera to the computer and risk damaging it.  Pull your SDHC card out of the camera (it takes a whole 1/10 second to pull your card out of the camera, just open the door and push on it) and put it into the computer if your computer has a SDHC card reader. The software supplied with the camera will know you put the card into a reader and it will prompt you to download the files, both video and photo.  If your computer doesn't have a SDHC card reader, buy a good inexpensive USB card reader.  They are only around $15 or so.  It is much faster and safer and less hassle to pull your card out of the camera to download the files.  Just do it.Update 7/27/11.  This update is a game changer for this camera.

I have a trip to Belize coming up where I will be kayaking and river rafting and definitely did not want to take my clunky DSLR but I wanted a camera that could take decent pictures with a powerful zoom so I could photograph wildlife and also have good video capability so I wouldn't have to bring a separate video camera. I have the FZ18 and was very happy with it.  I read everything I could on the web about the FZ100 before I pre-ordered it from Amazon and it had all the features I needed.  I was kind of apprehensive about getting the camera when I read the negative reviews about image quality, however, there were some positve reviews to counter the negative. Some especially helpful threads were on Steve's Digicams (there are some nice pictures from the FZ100 posted there) and Dpreview.I chose the FZ100 because of its 11 fps burst mode (beats my D90 5 FPS burst mode), articulating LCD, electronic viewfinder, HD AVCHD video and 24X zoom.  I did not choose the Canon Powershot SX20 IS because I felt it was too heavy and it only has 20X zoom plus the LCD is smaller than the FZ100's LCD. I ruled out the Olympus SP 800-UZ because it did not have an electronic viewfinder, and the Fuji Finepix HS10 was even heavier than the Canon.  I tried out the camera when my parents came for a visit and got to compare the FZ100 with my Dad's Canon SX20 IS.  I used it in all sorts of conditions to take pictures at our local dahlia festival and got some really great indoor and outdoor shots of the dahlias and great close up shots of bumblebees (macro mode is outstanding).  The next day was overcast and despite the conditions, the camera took nice scenery shots.  I couldn't see much difference between my dad's pictures and mine (we viewed them on my laptop). I took my pictures using the P mode and automatic mode.The video was excellent.  I really liked being able to use the zoom function while taking video (I think I won't be needing my video camera anymore!).  I got some fantastic action shots of my dog catching a frisbee using both the 11 FPS burst mode and 5 FPS autofocus burst mode (a fabulous feature!). The camera is small and light enough to take almost anywhere and though the picture quality is not as good as a DSLR (especially in low light conditions), I am quite pleased with my decision to purchase the FZ100 and plan on keeping it.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good 'Super-Zoom'.", "Author": "D. Hentze", "ReviewID": "R3V2XMF6UUZXQR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had a few days to play with the new DMC-FZ100, and for the most part, the results are good. Let me first say before anything, if you're expecting DSLR quality photographs with this or any other 'Super Zoom', it isn't going to happen. Since I already own the FZ35, most of the FZ100's features are familiar to me. The FZ100's best feature is its 25-600mm LEICA Lens. I also prefer its wider angle compared to the FZ35's 27mm. Panasonic's POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) does a great job up to about 18X zoom. When you're zooming at full length, don't expect miracles. It helps, but you'll still need a fairly steady hand and fairly high shutter speeds to get the best pics. Panasonic's iA mode does a very good job as usual, but still tends to sometimes use a higher ISO than necessary. I prefer \"P\" mode with a little manual tweaking of various settings. Most people will consider the FZ100's 3\" free-angle LCD a big improvement over the FZ35's fixed 2.7\" screen. I haven't played around much with the FZ100's video yet, but from what I've taken, it seems to be at least equal to the FZ35. All this leads to me to my biggest disappointment I have with the FZ100. Image quality just isn't as good as the FZ35 under any circumstances. It doesn't mean that the FZ100 isn't capable of taking 'good' pictures, just that my older FZ35 takes better pictures. I've tried just about every setting combination possible and the FZ35 still wins. I'm not overly surprised though, since they're cramming 14.1 MP into a small sensor. Too bad marketing dictates increasing MP count with every new camera. If the FZ100 was 10 MP, it would probably produce excellent images instead of just good.  With that being said, the FZ100's results still are good, and from what I've seen from the other 20+X Zoom cameras, it still beats them. If you're not expecting DSLR results, and aren't obsessed with \"pixel peeping\", than I recommend the DMC-FZ100. If you're thinking of upgrading from the FZ35 like I did, you'll have to ask yourself if the 24x wider zoom and other improvements are worth sacrificing some image quality.Pros:24X 25-600mm LEICA Lens3\" free-angle LCDPOWER O.I.S.

Miller", "ReviewID": "R2BQF1OXTP8SC0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "**********Yellowstone update: Last week, I took over 7000 photos of bears, bison, wolves, elk, moose, geysers, mud pots, etc., and I'm thrilled with the FZ100's performance. It was comfortable in my hand and on the strap around my neck. It could burst shoot and then shoot a slightly shorter burst while the first burst was still processing. The only real wait I had was when switching to video; it wouldn't start until all photos were processed. Learned that one while filming the grizzly bear directly across the river.One recommendation: get as large an SD card as you can afford, or buy several smaller cards.A few more thoughts:* The burst mode, is in my opinion, the key feature of this camera. It's why I was able to take 7000 pictures in 7 days. I'm deleting photos left and right, but 75% of them came out clearly and in focus, and an amazing 20% are keeper shots (I was expecting 5%). And catching the bear while he was shaking water out of his fur . . . priceless.* The battery kept going, and going, and going. Burst shots do not appear to be included in the estimated 450 shots per battery recharge--one day I shot nearly 2300 pictures, along with some video.* After experimenting with the zoom, I think it may be better to reduce the resolution to, say, 7mp, or even 5mp, and increase the optical zoom at its extreme range rather than keeping resolution at 14mp and then cropping the result to the same size. The camera appears to keep more fine detail, and the exposure is often more appropriate.* Pictures taken with the digital zoom look more like paintings by Monet than realistic photographs, but they're pictures that I couldn't have gotten otherwise, and it was fun to pick out animals waaayyy across the valley.* The video mode is great, with fine detail, and I could convert frames into 2mp photos in two clicks. The video button on top of the camera made it easy to switch from stills to video.* Nearly all of my photos were shot during the day at ISO 400 or less, usually ISO 100. They were stunning. Night shots weren't so great. For that I recommend a tripod, a remote shutter control, and a long shutter speed combined with as low an ISO as you can manage.I am definitely keeping this camera!**********I'm upgrading from a Kodak EasyShare P712 and chose to buy the Panasonic FZ100 mainly because it had a 24x zoom and a 5 frame-per-second autofocus burst mode. The initial reviews weren't promising when it came to image quality, but, hey, hope springs eternal. I've been experimenting with the FZ100 for a week now, and last night was a great night for a sunset/low light test.The results? It's better than the Kodak. First, it successfully took shots within the Kodak's range that the Kodak couldn't properly focus on (clouds, stars). Second, its burst mode rocks! Ten pics in 2 seconds--one of 'em is bound to look good. Third, its image quality (IQ) was better--and I've been generally happy with the Kodak's IQ.That doesn't mean the FZ100's IQ is great. As a recovering perfectionist, I don't dare \"pixel peep,\" but I still can tell that the image quality of the FZ100 is only decent. None of the superzooms have great quality, but I had hoped for good. This is my biggest disappointment, and the reason I almost sent the camera back. ISO 100 is the way to go on this camera, and even it has some noise. Unless the setting absolutely requires it, I won't set the ISO above 400, and that's pushing it.The other thing I'll do is set the \"Quality\" to RAW+fine jpg. That way, if a jpg looks good enough to print in something larger than 4\"x6\", I can work with the RAW file. RAW produces better photos with a little post processing. The only down side is that you can't take nearly as many pictures on the same SD card, but I can live with that. There are some other tweaks that help, like turning down the noise reduction, but I'm still playing with that.As a video camera, the FZ100 is very good. The zoom is slower for videos than for stills, but wow, it works well! For those family and pet shots that I never intend to print, I may even turn on the video instead and then pull out the best frame.Biggest pros:* 24x superzoom* 11 fps burst mode or 5 fps burst mode with autofocus* 1080i HD video (with smooth zoom)* Easy to manually tweak shotsBiggest con:* noise above ISO 200If you want better image quality and don't care about a camera's video capabilities, then you may want to look at the older Panasonic FZ35, or wait for more reviews on the new FZ40. And if you don't mind changing lenses, then go DSLR. They far outshine superzoom cameras in image quality. But if you're looking for a good all-around camera and camcorder, the FZ100 may be just the ticket.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Seeing is believing, FZ35-FZ100 Comparison: REVISITED", "Author": "Simon Sharpe", "ReviewID": "RGJDRUJUUBZ2D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I enjoyed this camera for the 36 hours I have used it.

I started out with using just the iA mode. Venturing out from there mostly in the \"P\" mode, I have explored:1. The optical zoom vs. extend optical zoom - amazing range/clarity2. Using with my neck mounted mini tripod - adds steadying effect for long zooms3. The macro mode - outstanding sharpness4. The multi-angle LCD and the viewfinder - adds flexibility5.

I realize that this camera does not have the absolute best image, but it does take very good pictures! In low light the MOS sensor is not quite as good as the CCD sensor, but limiting the ISO and the use of the viewfinder or tripod does help to handle the noise.I have tried out four other cameras before buying the FZ100. The closest to my preferences was the Canon SX20, but to me it lacked many of the FZ100's useful features, it was slower and menu access was more difficult. The Lumix FZ-35 was also a fine camera, but was much slower and lacked features that I wanted.  Both the Nikon P100 and the Fuji HS10 seem to be fine cameras, but lacked refinement as compared to either the Panasonic or the Canon models.After working with a number of the available features in the FZ100, I have become very impressed with the seamless nature of this camera. To incorporate so many advanced features with convenient controls into the camera and still maintain its ease of use seems truly amazing to me.

I have owned several point and shoot cameras (Canon and Olympus) and neither would take a decent photo of action shots under high school stadium or gym lighting. I thought I had no choice but buy a full blown DSLR but my budget would not allow it. After reading many reviews I decided to take a chance and try this camera. I also considered the Fuji Finepix HS10 and the Canon SX20 but what sold me on the FX100 is the 5 and 11FPS Burst Modes. For this burst mode to work well does require a fast SD card. Panasonic recommends at least a Class 6 card. I bought a 16GB Class 10 card and it works well with this camera. When I shoot in the 11FPS mode the camera will burst 32 pictures at full speed then the rate will start to drop as the card buffer fills slowing to around 4 FPS and will maintain 4 FPS as long as I hold the button down. In the 5 FPS mode it just seems to keep shooting only slowing slightly. The first time I used it I shot 840 14 mega pixel pictures in 9 minutes! It did not even put a dent in the battery charge! Another reviewer said they shot over 2000 pics on a single charge. I believe it! The 24X optical zoom means I can sit in the stands and zoom all the way in so my kid fills the frame and the picture does not grain out like my other camera. I can finally capture the shots I have been missing! Daytime action shots turn out great! And I can speed up the shutter speed even more.There is a lot of debate about image quality with this camera. Under normal use conditions this camera takes a better picture than any point and shoot camera I have used. As with all point and shoot cameras the built in flash is usually over bearing but this camera has a hot shoe so an external flash can be used with much more control. The action pictures I take under stadium lighting are taken in P mode with the shutter speed set to a minimum of 1/125 sec with the Intelligent ISO turned on. The pictures taken are generally at 800 ISO. The pictures are grainy but very usable. Printed on 4X6 paper it is barely noticeable. On a 22\" monitor you can see it. This is the trade off I had to make. To get a crystal clear photo at ISO's above 400 with fast shutter speeds you will have to buy a DSLR. And to get a DSLR with a high burst rate capability will cost you a bundle. And I have not even mentioned the 1080 P high definition video.

I became tired of lugging around DSLR equipment and missing some great shots. However, one must not compare this camera's IQ with the IQ of a good DSLR.....but then what is great IQ if you do not have an image to begin with. In this respect, the FZ100 in overall performance is as fast as or faster than a DSLR.I am an experienced amateur photographer, having won many awards in thirty-five mm photography many moons ago. Those days are over forever. This is not my first digital camera. However, it is now necessary for us old timers and serious beginners alike to learn how advanced digital cameras work and how the interaction of various settings on them will effect and affect the images produced. The complexities for a beginner, who has relied on point and shoot, will be daunting. Those who are not computer literate will also be at a disadvantage. These caveats apply to the FZ100.Right out of the box, the FZ100 in IA (Intelligent Automatic - nice for just \"Automatic\") mode  will produce decent, but not great, results...In fact, in many cases this camera will produce images inferior to inexpensive point and shoots until one not just reads, but also understands and implements what is contained in the advanced manual (and refers to suggestions to settings published on the Net)....and understands the camera itself and becomes comfortable with it. This takes patience and time. If you cannot muster up patience and time, do not buy a bridge camera and expect miracles. A good camera does not make a good photographer. Some of the professional reviews of the FZ100, downgrading its IQ, reflect an out-of-the-box experience. (The same goes for the Canon SX30is et al, for which my review might also apply; but I liked some of the features of the FZ100 better, such as its burst mode up to 60 frames/sec, 1080p video, and better stabilization.....by the way, most reviews do not mention this, but the actual OPTICAL zoom range is actually 32X not 24X, thus beating out the Cannon and with supposedly somewhat better results, depending upon the review and the reviewer. As far as my experience, if the shutter speed is high enough, the results are very good.All I am going to say is that once one gets used to the FZ100, and makes the correct adjustments, the results are absolutely superb both for still photos and video. Check out YouTube. As a bridge camera, the FZ100 gets FOUR and ONE HALF STARS.---------------------------------------------------UPDATE 12/27/2010I was asked in a comment what settings I used to improve IQ. The following is my answer:I trust that you are conversant with the basics of photography; but I wrote the following for someone who might not be as knowledgeable as you.The following are some of the settings that I have my camera set to. Much depends upon your taste and the shooting situation. Pretend that the FZ100 is a 35mm SLR from the 1970's. No one setting will satisfy every situation or everybody. Refer to pages 209 and 210 of the advanced manual and make sure you know what the jargon means and what each setting does so you can set the camera accordingly. Also, make sure you download the latest firmware update. As of this writing, it is Version 1.2.Start with \"P\"or Program mode on the dial. In use, \"P\" automatically sets the camera to a combination of what it considers to be the best f-stop and shutter speed. This does work well for quick point-and-shoots and long telephoto shots. However, good luck at trying to control depth of field, etc. I hardly use this setting, but the menu can be initially set up this way. After the camera is set up this way, then go back and tweak it for the \"A, S, and M\" modes. I almost always shoot on Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, or Manual, the last being one of the reasons I purchased this camera over the Canon. Manual settings are easier with the FZ100.RECSet the FILM MODE to \"Dynamic\" or \"Vibrant\"Contrast: +1 or +2Sharpness: +1Color Saturation: +1Noise Reduction -1 (or even -2) , but you may need a little post processing noise reduction for -2 (The reason you can reduce the noise reduction setting is because of the following PICTURE SIZE and the ISO settings.PICTURE SIZE: 10.5 mega-pixels. (Panasonic, as well as others, should never have tried to cram 14 mega-pixels into a small sensor. You will be surprised at the reduction in noise and artifacts just by this setting alone....)If shooting in jpeg, use the best setting, i.e. the six rectangular boxesISO sensitivity set to 100 or 200; OR set the next option on page 2 of the menu (\"ISO LIMIT SET\") an upper limit of no more than 400. Remember that the most popular professional 35mm slide and color films were all less than 400 ASA/ISO way back when. Use 400 and higher only when you must. At 1600, the pics are still very usable and superior to many ISO 400 films of the past.White Balance leave at automatic; but I have programmed the Fn button for white balance. Setting the white balance to \"cloudy\" on a fairly sunny day can give you some really vibrant results. If you have incandescent lighting at home, set it for \"incandescent\" if you wish to shoot without a flash. The results are very good.Try these settings, and see what you think.There are about 10,000 other permutations for adjusting the FZ100, but I turn most of them off , especially the C-F (Continuous Focus) for still photos. It just wastes the battery.However, you may want to turn on the I.R. (I.Resolution) to \"i.zoom.\" This effectively gives you an OPTICAL 32X zoom lens (something like a macro setting, but in the long direction instead. My camera claims that the zoom is actually 37X.) It works seamlessly and quite well...well enough to read sharply a license plate at about 200 yards if you support the camera and have a high enough shutter speed...so much for the reviews of IQ.If you do wish to shoot in Manual, turn on the MF ASSIST. (It only works when you shoot in manual and is a great help)I set the flash to forced-on. That way, the flash will always be ready when the flash is raised regardless of conditions and especially when I want fill-in light outdoors, e.g., to eliminate the shadows on faces or to compensate manually for back-lighting without changing the f-stop (EV).Always, Always, Always make sure that the shutter speed is high enough, especially at the longer end of the zoom... that is, of course, unless you wish to blur the action.Oh yes...and do get a good 52mm UV filter. (This is another reason I chose the Panasonic over the Canon. The Canon lens is not threaded for accessories. You must buy an expensive extension tube. With the Panasonic, all you have to do is screw on any 52mm accessory...and the lens cap still works.)There's much more.

A couple of years ago I bought an FZ28 and was quite impressed by the image quality, for a point and shoot. Of course, it did not even come close to the quality I get from my big camera, but there was nothing really to complain about other than comparatively slow focusing which is not unusual for point and shoot cameras. I recently purchased the FZ100 from Amazon. Believe me, the 14 megapixels made me very cautious - that is an awful lot for a tiny sensor and in the past that kind of pixel density has resulted in disaster. Panasonic is definitely doing something different because the image quality of the FZ100 is definitely better than the FZ28 PROVIDED you make a few changes to the settings. It is also much better than you would expect from a 14 Mp tiny sensor - this does not have a CCD sensor. I have found setting the noise reduction to -1 or -2 improves the image detail considerably even though it has a bit more digital noise in the image. For photos, I prefer to turn the sharpness down to -1 and also set saturation and contrast at -1 or -2. You need to experiment a little to find what you like best. For base images for paintings I often go the other way with the settings.  On the whole the image quality is quite good for a superzoom, even at maximum zoom. At the widest angle there is a bit of distortion in the corners, but that is not unusual for a superzoom point and shoot wide angle. But it is perfectly usable in regular size prints. Of course, with big prints, well, the images might not be so great. The focus is very fast, unlike the FZ28 - I can even photograph birds and not have them vanish before the camera focuses. There are gobs of wonderful little settings that are really useful - such as being able to change the area the camera uses to judge focus and then move the focus point around; how I wish my DSLR did that. Exposure accuracy is very good with a nice but not great dynamic range.  If you are thinking that 14 megapixels alone is going to give you DSLR quality you will be terribly disappointed. Judge it for what it is and you will be quite pleased. The lens on this camera, as is often the case with Panasonic, is excellent and to get that quality from such a wide range zoom is a credit to the Panasonic-Leica relationship. I did not give it a 5 star rating because I don't think any point and shoot deserves 5 stars and most don't deserve more than about a 3 and some can't break above 2. But for point and shoot cameras 4 is as high as I will go and this camera is a solid 4 star camera.  As for my uses, I don't suspect I will use it that much for photography as I have a big, expensive camera with wonderful lenses for that purpose. That is not to say it will not produce fine photographs, because it does. Where it will be particularly useful is photographing scenes that I want to turn into my digital paintings. The problem with using a high quality DSLR for digital painting is there is way too much detail to deal with and your paintings tend to come out looking more like really bad photographs. With the FZ100 that deep detail is not there and if one turns up the noise reduction to the maximum the detail really vanishes leaving the essentials which is what is needed for digital painting. By tweaking the noise reduction one can get as much or as little detail as is desirable for a base image for digital painting. High noise reduction with a DSLR still leaves at least 100 times more detail than is desirable. With the good wide angle to super telephoto and excellent color the FZ100 is an excellent tool for the digital artist. But if you are only interested in photos and don't make huge prints the FZ100 will be good and very versatile. It also has very good video capabilities that might replace the need for a dedicated video camera.  I highly recommend this camera, but keep your expectations sensible and don't go pixel peeping. Believe me, this isn't a Hasselblad digital camera; nor does it cost $40,000 - for the body only.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "it's ok,  but.....", "Author": "K.

The FZ100 was no improvement over the other 2. Besides that, the camera was heavy and clumsy to handle. I did not test the video since that is not a major concern for me, I am happy with the MPEG short videos that I occasionally take. I am about stills of wildlife, nature and my cats.

Nikon did have a time lapse feature winch was cool and was slightly easier to navigate on the menus, but the Lumix is far better in every aspect, and is easier to change settings in manual mode + gives some nice control over focusing. The lumix auto-focus is great, it is quick and stays on target... the nikon was terrible and took a long time.Pro:Awesome zoom & Full 1080p HD video recordingImage quality is better than others in class (Nikon P100 or Cannon equivalent)I did some night shots the other night... landscape and moon...and it automatically selected some HDR feature and took 5 photos and combined them so you could see everything clearly!Cons:software it comes with is junk...like usual...i never use them anywaysImage quality isn't quite there in low light, but for anything in low light up to an 8x10' it looks great.

First, read Rolla \"Ken\" Gravett's extensive review here on the FZ100.  His review is way more detailed than mine will be. However I'll cover a few items that I really love about this camera as well as a couple with which I'm less thrilled.IMAGE FORMAT - I love that I can take photos in 16:9 format to match my HDTV and wide screen PC monitor sizes.  That's very cool.IMAGE QUALITY - I've compared shots taken from the same spot with my Nikon D40 and the FZ100, and frankly I don't see much difference.  I generally shoot outdoors on the FZ100 with a maximum ISO setting of 400, typically at ISO 100, and usually with a \"Moose's warm Polarizing filter\" left over from my Nikon days.  I also generally limit my pixel setting to 7.5 since I NEVER print anything larger than 11\" x 14\" and rightly or wrongly I feel 7.5 megapixels is plenty to give me a quality image.  So in short, I've been quite pleased by the image quality from this camera.  To each his/her own.  I see very little difference between the images from my several past Nikon's and Nikon lenses and the images from this camera.ZOOM LENS - The zoom capability with this lens is simply astonishing. I shot a photo of a friend's 37 foot Tayana yacht from a dock further down river.  In the widest angle setting I could barely pick out the distinctive cream color of the hull on his boat.  As I zoomed closer, more of the vessel came into view.  At maximum zoom I COULD NOT ONLY READ HIS Sea Gypsy NAME, I COULD ALSO CLEARLY READ \"San Francisco\" in small print beneath the name Sea Gypsy!  I read somewhere that the total zoom capability on this camera is the 35mm camera equivalent of from 25mm to over 1200mm!!!  Used on a tripod, or even a monopod at a sporting event, or for nature photography, wow!  Imagine the possibilities.  Using two heavy lenses on my Nikons my range was from 28mm to 200mm!HD VIDEO - I shot videos at a concert recently featuring the remarkably talented and beautiful Nicki Parrott.  These are available on YouTube.  They were shot handheld using available light only, and the on-camera built-in stereo microphone.  See what you think.  Look for the CACSJ series (here's one:  [...] I'm pretty happy with them.  By the way, shooting in the Motion JPEG mode while restricted to 720p and requiring a LOT more space on your SD card provides a MUCH brighter picture so I ALWAYS use MJPEG mode for available light indoor shots.  AVCHD may be okay outdoors, but forget using it in low light conditions.I bought an external Alzden stereo mic for the camera, and have yet to really test it in a crowded environment, but it works fine AS LONG AS you buy a 3.5mm to 2.5mm converter!!!  This is a MUST in order to use anyone's external mic other than Panasonic's very expensive offering.MAJOR GRIPES - There are three:1. Panasonic provides a camera that records video in High Definition, and then only provides a crappy COMPOSITE (\"RCA\" style red-white-yellow) cable to connect the FZ100 camera to a TV set.  Hello, Panasonic!  It's the 21st Century, not 1950.  This means you have to buy an extra cost HDMI cable if you want to view your HD videos on an HDTV set in High Definition!  AND for older HD sets that don't have HDMI input slots, there is NO HD COMPONENT cable available anywhere, including from Panasonic, that will fit the FZ100!  The Panasonic Component Cable available for prior model cameras and camcorders WILL NOT FIT THE FZ100!  Thanks a lot, Panasonic, for CHANGING the slot size on the FZ100.  Duh!  Since our 50\" Samsung HD DLP set will only accept COMPONENT cable for producing a signal in High Definition, that means I can't view my FZ100 HD videos in High Def on the Samsung because it doesn't accept HDMI cables.  VERY frustrating to record videos in HD and have to view them on my large screen DLP HD TV in \"LOW\" Definition only!2. Aftermarket batteries do not as of this writing let you know how much charge they have left in them, and some don't even work at all.  Therefore, stick to the EXPENSIVE Panasonic brand batteries for backup.  I paid $60 for mine, but they have come down in price a little by now, and they do run for a longgggg time before dying.3. The little red \"record video\" button is difficult to engage.  At a rehearsal of our little jazz trio last night I lost two videos because I thought I was recording after having pressed the red record button, but instead AFTER the set when I thought I was turning OFF the recording button I actually was only then turning it ON so I got some great shots of the ceiling, etc., but no music.  Be sure you see the little icon of a movie projector on the display screen before you assume you are recording videos!OVERALL - I LOVE this camera, in spite of the few accessories gripes.  The image quality is fine, the zoom range is incredible, it's small, but seems sturdily built, and once one starts becoming familiar with it's 240 page owner's manual, it is a powerful tool for any photographer.  And it shoots in RAW as well as JPG or RAW AND JPG for those who like to fool around working with RAW processing.

I believe FZ100 has newer and improved Sensor, and i love it.Conclusion, i love all FZ, FZ100 is a better and more improved than its 1 year old FZ35 brother, for those who said negative things about FZ100 only because they have not play with it long enough, or too rush to judge.Now my FZ35 will back up my FZ100 on the field.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Enthusiast Camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2705RIUFGWUJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent close to a year looking at upgrade camera options and finally settled on the FZ-100.  I have been very impressed with my previous compact Lumix but was looking for something with a longer reach and some greater exposure control.  I considered all of the micro 4/3 cameras with interchangeable lenses.  I could not justify the cost and the need to lug a bag with different lenses.  My original review of the FZ-100 reviews caused me to dismiss this option but as I continued my search I found myself returning to the features that this camera and few others offer.  I especially like the fold out LCD screen.  It really gives you more creativity in composition.  The HD video is also an excellent option, my compact Lumix has this feature which totally amazes me and the FZ-100 full HD really is great to capture spontaneous video moments.  When I searched for this camera on the Amazon site and read the reviews, especially the very comprehensive one by Rolla Gravett it was apparent that this camera would meet my needs.  I have used the new camera for two weeks and find that it has exceeded my expectations.  If you want to carry a bag full of prestige, Canon, Nikon and the rest have lots of cameras that will lighten your wallet.

The IQ of the MOS sensor has suffered a little over the CCD quality of the FZ35/40's. This is a tradeoff of having to allow for the faster needed processing of the MOS sensor for the 1920x1080 HD video. But if your not pixel peeping you probably won't see a difference.The overall colors of the FZ100 just jump out there compared to my FZ35. Sure you can PP to whatever but having those native colors in RAW is impressive.Also being able to shoot 2-10 fps burst singles with a full AF on each shot up to 5 fps, WHILE SHOOTING HD VIDEO is impressive.  The processing power in this little camera is blazing fast. I would say the FZ100 is at least 3 times faster at processing/write times versus my FZ35. I can shoot 10 shots with the FZ100 while the FZ35 is still writing the 3rd shot.  The AF is faster as well.  The whole camera is just way faster than the FZ35.  I don't own the new FZ40 so I can't say about it.When people are comparing the FZ35/40 versus the FZ100, I don't see too many mention the speed of the amazing FZ100.  Until you have owned both you really can't quantify the speed difference.  But once you actually physically compare, the FZ100 just leaps out with superior performance. IMHO, this extra processing/AF speed is a much overlooked attribute of the FZ100.For outright IQ of the singles there probably are a few cameras in this range which can top the FZ100, but for overall features and speed I don't think there is a better value than the FZ100.My FZ35 can slightly out resolve the FZ100, but the difference is much smaller than I had originally thought. The FZ100 is one camera that does reward the user for getting to know her. Even if you're totally a manual type, try the differene scene/function modes.  You might be suprised at how close they come to what you had intended with full manual adjustments.BTW, don't forget to check the firmware as Panasonic has issued version 1.2 for download.  Also be sure and try the included PhotoStudio software especially for the HD video.

Lots of noise even at ISO 400 and under.  But I took hope in a quick comment Josh Goldman of CNET made about the camera in his video four star review of this camera.  He said, \"if you are willing to shoot in RAW and do some post processing, the photos are much better\" or words to that effect.  The good news is that he is RIGHT, at least from my quick tests last night. I used Apple's Aperture 3 photo processing program with plug-ins from NIK and I was able to fairly quickly and dramaticly improve the quality on the indoor, low-light photos I was taking with this camera (and using no flash!).  Are they as good as the ones I can get with my Nikon d700 and using great glass?  No, but I am pretty fussy about picture quality and they are as good or better than I would have expected from any fixed lens camera in this price range. The caveat is that one must shoot in RAW and do the post processing.  You cannot shoot in RAW with the \"Intelligent Auto\" setting--the camera simply won't let you, so if your are looking for a 'camera does it all for you' situation, and are concerned about picture quality in indoor, low-light situations, then this camera is not for you.

I can echo the other reviews and agree that if you stay in good light and use an ISO of 100 the camera takes good pictures. The 24x zoom is good if you stay within those boundaries. However, going to 200 ISO is gets rough with noise. Going to 400 and above it gets abysmal.

I'm sure it has some strong points in the burst mode and hi def 1080i video but those are secondary to my needs. I used it indoors with flash in the iA mode, P mode - again  - the images were just full of noise. So I plan to send the camera back for a refund.

One camera case, no other accessories required.Video is over the top and audio is as good as any HD video cameraIQ for stills is still excellent for everyday shootingConvenient point and shoot or customize your shotseasy to use, intuitive controls and placementsMuch more versatile than just a point and shootOptical zoom is very good (again, this is not a DSLR)slo mo videofast startup time, fast cycling between shotsrapid fire action shots are extremely fast and you can shoot 5fps with auto focus.Intelligent Auto is accurate, it's got it for all around shooting conditionsIt will take you longer to think about what you want to do than to take the pictures.Finally, if you are really picky about picture quality and have to have only the best, get a DSLR, and if you are really, really picky, get the best of the best DSLR and all of the specialty lenses and accessories that go with it and drag that heavy bag on vacation, but by the time you dig into your bag to choose the right lens to set up your shot, I'll be long gone on to the next museum.I gave it 5 stars not because it's the best camera ever made but because it's the best camera in it's class to carry with you wherever you go.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great, Versatile Camera", "Author": "J. Green", "ReviewID": "R1JRMA2NOMM1SC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE AT BOTTOM!I've only had this camera for a few days, but I'll go ahead and give my initial impressions. I'm headed to the Grand Canyon next week, so I'll update the review when I get back with more detail as needed.I had been contemplating this purchase for a while. Then, I decided to wait for the Nikon P500. Upon seeing some mixed reviews and learning that that camera didn't have a \"night mode\" shutter of more than 8secs, I decided to revert back to plan A and go with the Lumix. So, far... I'm really happy I did.First, let me state that I'm an avid backpacker. I used to take a 35mm camera, an HDV video camera and pocket digital camera. This was more weight than my food for a week-long outing! I eventually changed to just the video camera and a better digital camera. Still too much. The hope was that with this purchase I could get down just to one camera -- without the expense and weight of a DSLR kit.  Priorities for me were lens versatility, manual controls, rugged but not heavy build, battery life, outdoor results and video quality. From what I've seen so far of the pictures/video -- I think I'm going to be pleased.My first impression was -- WOW this zoom is great. It got me up close and I was thrilled that it was fairly stead with the stabilizer at full 600mm.  I can't imagine trying to hand-hold anything beyond that though. The wide end of 25mm was great too. Made it easy to do self portraits -- especially with the reversible LCD monitor.  So... lens versatility was a definite CHECK.Manual controls/options seem to be really good so far. I like the arrangement of the dedicated buttons and the menus. It's not all 100% intuitive, but the manual is good and I expect to have full control once I learn it all. Downside is that there is NOT a full printed manual included (just a 'basic' manual). For all the good stuff you have to read via your computer. So... manual controls I will say CHECK.Rugged, but not heavy. We will see if it survives the Grand Canyon, but so far it feels really good in my hand and the buttons feel solid and it's still lighter than my 35mm or my previous bridge camera. My only small complaint re: construction is that if you have the lens hood (included!) attached backwards for storage, and turn off the camera while still having a firm grip -- the lens hood will pinch your finger (at least it happens with my big fingers!)  This is really not a big deal, so.. CHECK.Battery life: I really haven't given it a full run yet. But -- I've shot a bunch of photos and video already and have yet to put a dent in the meter. The ratings via other sites have been good here too, so I will go ahead and say CHECK.For Outdoor Results, so far I have been pleased -- but not blown away. Again -- I'm evaluating this as a bridge camera not a DSLR. As mentioned above, images relying on the zoom were great. But, in terms of pure quality I had some mixed results. Noise wasn't too much of an issue, but I was mostly shooting outside in bright sunlight. Close-ups of flowers were great. However, when I did landscape shots they were a little washed out. This is nothing that can't be easily fixed and I expect to learn to compensate in-camera.  I love that the camera does bracketing as well -- including the ability to customize the offset up to 3 stops! So... all-in-all a CHECK* here. *We will see how the quality is after more shots.Finally video quality.  My initial tests were pretty good. It's hard to evaluate this because video quality is really important to me -- maybe more important than should be required for a \"non-video\" camera.  My initial tests had really great color and exposure. The fact I can customize the mode settings in video is awesome. I was also very happy with the on-board mic, but that fact there's a hot-shoe is bonus. I will say it's the best video I've seen from any PnS camera. However, it wasn't quite as strong as a dedicated video camera in some ways. The focus would drift slightly, the zoom is slow and its control is not as video friendly and in very quiet spots you could here the zoom. BUT... I think if one is aware of these limitations it can produce great results. I plan on ditching my dedicated video camera for now. So... a tentative CHECK.Other GOOD stuff:- Threaded for filters. Yay!- Fast response time- Night shots up to 60 seconds long- Self-timer DOES include a 10 sec. X3 option!- LCD screen is reversible to protect it on the trail.Some BAD stuff:- Manual focus is VERY difficult using the scroll wheel- lens hood can be difficult to remove- turning histogram on/off requires menusSo all-in-all I'm pretty happy. I'll post some sample pics and update this review when I have more detail. Thx.UPDATE:I'm back from the Grand Canyon and have mixed feeling about the shots I got. Whereas originally I was torn between 4 or 5 stars, now I'm torn between 3 and 4. My \"Starry Night\" shots weren't nearly as good as I hoped (worse than other point and shoot) and bright outdoor shots are still washed out slightly. The video controls and stabilizer were noticebly inferior to my stand-alone video camera -- but the locked off shots were better in color. After doing more post work than I'd like, I have some pretty great shots of the canyon, so I'm still pretty happy -- and definitely enjoyed the lighter package and great battery life. So... I'm still fairly happy and I'll leave it at 4 Stars.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "fully satisfied", "Author": "Eva Schulz", "ReviewID": "R2KDC4HZG60JE3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is the first time i use a panasonic camera and i am quite pleased with the quality of the images. on the positive side; the cam is light weight, has user friendly interface, responds fast, amazing high definition imaging and fantastic zoom. the type of consulting work i do, most times require photography and although this is not classified as a professional cam, it acts like one. i think there is room for improvement in color management and macro shooting... but all in all, very good cam!", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for long-zoom point-and-shoot", "Author": "dwf \"computer guy\"", "ReviewID": "R1O8J4L8E2IJ82", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading many reviews, I decided to order this camera.

I bought it off amazon at about 8am yesterday and had it delivered to my house at 3pm same day using their same day service for 20 bucks and could not be happier.  My last point and shoot was a canon sd600 and I currently us a Panasonic 3ccd camcorder.  don't remember its model#.  anyway pics and zoom are mind blowing.  the video is truly stunning.  I read reviews until I had to force my self to stop  and just make the dang purchase.  Despite some mixed reviews in places about IQ and comparisons to it earlier models  I could not walk away from the specs and the video and zoom examples on you-tube.  I can say they are accurate but only much better in real life. Now granted I have only had camera for one day but I can tell you there will be no need for the camcorder anymore. Balance and fit in hand is terrific and lcd is same.  I find the complaints about the price a bit odd.  after using the camera and hd video I can say for certain thatthis is an unbeatable value for anyone who wants a great combo.  I see no need for the 14mp but understand the marketingpressure regardless of how stupid that level of MP is?  I also like the fact that it has the single battery versus the AA option that the competing canon and fuji use.  I have had some of the higher end canons that use the AA system and all I can say is it is a huge pain in the butt, very expensive and very heavy.  Stick with lithium batteries and don't buy into the\"well you can pick up AAs anywhere bull.  It sucks believe me.  Very happy with the service from amazon on this one andabsolutely could not be happier with camera.

Many reviewers state how great it is, many write on how their expectations were high and the camera did not live up to them.  I actually purchased one, received it and immediately returned it because of those negative reviews.  After doing more research I thought that I made a mistake and I again purchased the camera and have since received this second camera.  After using the second FZ100, I decided that the negative reviews were probably written by professional wanna be's whose expectations were set very high.  What they wanted was a professional camera priced at only a fraction of what it costs to achieve their desired results.  What Panasonic and Canon have done is to package a non-professional camera packed with features that either basic camera or amateur photographers will enjoy using and owning.  It is a great high end consumer camera and if in the future their owners want a professional style camera, a DSLR for example, they can invest their hard earned money knowing that their interest is serious and their new professional camera with all it's lenses and other accessories, will not set on a shelf collecting dust for years to come.  Just my opinion and take it for what you think it is worth.6/13/11 UpdateI have had this camera since October 2010.  Results of using this camera have exceeded my expectations.  Went to Hawaii in April 2011 and shot a little over 1000 shots.  In reviewing and editing these pictures of 4 islands have had issues in reducing the number of pictures down to a manageable number but I still have 400 shots in my Hawaii file.  Way too many to work with but most are very good pictures or represent memories that we sill cherish.  The ability to shoot rapid shots allowed for some very good action shots of waterfalls, dances etc.  Did a lot of playing with different camera settings but as most of the pictures were of scenery used aperture and shutter priority quite a bit.  Have blown up a few shots to my maximum print capabilities of 13\"x19\" with my Canon Pixma 9000 with very good results.  Again I am not using pictures for professional purposes but for personal use.  All that have seen them have commented on how good they are.Still give the camera a 5 star rating.  Next trip to Alaska and see how it performs with a lot of whites.

Sold my GH1's a couple months ago, and bought the zs3 Lumix. The 25mm wide really spoiled me on the zs3 compared to the 28mm (35mm equiv) on the GH1's. So seeing the FZ100 had a 25mm (35mm equiv) I thought I could buy it and sell my Lumix zs3. But comparing the two cams (both on and recording, shooting the same scene, one above the other) the FZ100 looks like about 31 or 32 at the wide end! I even compared it to my Sony FX1000 which is a 29.5 mm (35mm equiv) and the FZ100 is not as wide as the Sony. (also have a Sony HX1 which also is a little wider, 2-4mm, than the FZ100!)Anyone know how to get the full 25mm (35mm equiv) activated on this unit? Again, I am only using it for video, typically.This camera is very close to being a GH1 with a dedicated lens. It has a Mic input, like the GH1. It will record up to the length of the card. (No 29 minute limit like on other brands of cams) Same connections/connectors in the Body, but this one has power zoom all the way out to 24x and a momentary auto focus button, that can be activated after you finish zooming. The low light capability is not as good as the GH1, but I really like the smooth look of the 1920 x 1080, it looks great on a good HDTV. I never did like having to change lens' on the GH1 to get closer than 280mm (35mm equiv.) The FZ100 goes way past that, without having to lug around a second lens!The pricing is a plus also.The built in mics work great too. I was at an extremely loud News Boys concert, and the sound did not distort at all. One song had an over-driving bass beat, really loud bass drum thumping, which lowers the mic levels within milli seconds, so this caused a less than professional sound recording on this one song, but for the most part, I am still really pleased with the picture, and sound. (same reverse volume pumping happens when people clap along to a song)These digital cameras reproduce purples really well also. My old VX 1000 Sonys would turn almost any shade of purple to blue.I made a 45 minute Blu Ray disc of the concert footage, so I'm able to study the footage, over and over. The compression looks very good, especially with the subject matter, super intense spotlights pulsing on and off, shooting thru fog, and sometimes the high intensity led spotlights shooting directly into my lens.Panasonic made a tremendous camera for under $500.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "It`s PERFECT", "Author": "Claudia B.

Tons of features, unbelievable zoom range. I am also a die-hard Lumix P&S; user and Nikon pro gear shooter. I own the Lumix FX01, TZ3, ZS7, two TS2's and a TS3. The FZ100 is the only of my Lumixes that I have turned around and sold, and I sold it a week after I bought it.The Leica lenses embarrass all but the very highest-end Canon and Nikon P&S; cameras and bury lesser brands like Olympus and Pentax. I have owned a Canon G12 but sold it quickly because its handling was just too sluggish despite having very nice image quality. For DSLR money, I expect reasonable usability speed and the G12 was just frustratingly slow and the menu system was really inefficient. The FZ100 menu is familiar to most P&S; cameras and is a SUPER-easy transition for existing Lumix users.The zoom lens is, frankly, amazing! That range is just spectacular!Handling is quick. Much faster than the Canon G12.So why my really low rating??? Very simple: the sensor is AWFUL! Panasonic opted for this particular sensor because they aimed it at the video market. Well, it takes terrible photos. I'm sorry to say, but it's true. EVERY other Lumix I've owned takes better photos. Megapixels mean NOTHING when the sensor sucks. Colors lacked saturation and depth and images never seemed sharp. Some of this could possibly be because of the lens, but I find it hard to fault a Leica lens when these characteristics are typical of bad sensors, particularly tiny high-megapixel ones and this sensor was not designed for still images.That brings me to the reason I bought this camera; the high-speed video for super-slow-motion. Well, it's ridiculous. If you're not shooting in bright sunlight, and I mean this literally, BRIGHT sunlight, it won't work. To get the really high shutter speed you need for super-slo-mo, you need LOTS of light and/or really high ISO. And speaking of high ISO, the FZ100 has THE worst high ISO performance I've experienced in ANY camera. This is no exaggeration. Anything above ISO 400 is very unappealing and forget ISO 1600, it's downright ugly and wouldn't serve any purpose other than surveillance but ISO 1600 isn't enough for surveillance... Plus, the resolution for super-slow-mo is ridiculously low. Anything beyond crappy YouTube caliber is beyond reach. Even regular HD video is unimpressive. Poor color, saturation and clarity.This camera is chock full of features but it's all for nothing as no matter what you do, you will never get tight colorful saturated images or appealing video and you'll never get that super-slo-mo that made me buy this camera.Though I haven't used it, I'm willing to bet that the FZ40 is a MUCH better choice. It is essentially the SAME camera as the FZ100 but with different sensors and the FZ40 can't do super-slo-mo. But the FZ100, in real life, can't do it either anyway. And the FZ40 doesn't have a swivel screen. Also look into the newer FZ47 and FZ150 offerings. If you can live with a \"sane,\" and still impressive, zoom range, look into the Lumix ZS7. Very nice images for a P&S;, quite reasonably priced and MUCH smaller.The FZ100 is a huge disappointment from such a great camera company.

So please forgive my non-technical review :)I read several of the reviews before deciding on this camera, and while there were several negative reviews there were far more positive ones so I decided to give it a shot.  When I first took the camera out of the box, I almost cried; it took super fast shots and had pretty incredible zoom capability, but when I loaded the pics on my computer they were terrible-- grainy, out of focus, and generally ugly.  I had it back in the box ready to be returned when I remembered something I had read in the other reviews about messing with the ISO settings in the A or P modes.  I read a bunch more reviews (on Amazon and other sites as well) as well as REALLY read through the user manual (as opposed to just skimming it like I usually do), messed with some of the settings, and now I couln't be happier.  The burst mode is fanstastic, especially since I have little kids- I love taking a bunch in a row and then slowly going through them to pick the best shot.  I took some closeups of flowers and bugs, and to my eye (and those of many of my also non-professional friends), the images look like magazine-quality photos.  Even without the burst on, the speed is incredibly fast; there is basically no shutter lag at all.  The zoom is more than adequate for my needs; I took a picture of a STOP sign at an intersection that is probably 1/5-1/4 of a mile away from my backyard, and I took a picture of the moon in which I could actually see surface detail.  I want to get a tripod, because I am sure if the camera was stable it would take even better shots.  There are a TON of presets for shooting in different conditions (so many that I haven't even tried them all yet); some of them work wonderfully, some are just OK.  I hope that as time goes by I will have more time to mess with individual settings and get better image quality from those that are just OK.  Indoors, the camera takes pretty good shots as long as there is good light; when the flash is on (especially in the flash-burst mode) the pictures still get a little grainy (although one of my friends commented that she actually liked it, because the graininess gave the image a more \"artsy\" feel-- so I guess it's all in what you like).  Some of the negative reviews said the battery-life is very short; I have had no problems with this.  I fully charged the battery and I have taken pictures every day for more than a week and it still says that it's fully charged.  I haven't used the editing software at all, but the dowloading wizard makes it very fast and easy to load pics to my PC.  There are a few little design things that bug me-- the delete button is in weird place, and the screen is off to the side when it's open, so it took me a few tries to figure out where I was actually pointing my lens.  But those are just little personal preferences, and I'm already getting used to them. Over all, I am more than happy with this camera; basically I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is not wonderful straight out of the box-- it does take some effort and reading time to get it where it needs to be.

I'm able to edit the Panasonic RAW photos in photoshop with excellent results. The only thing I miss in the Panasonic is the time lapse function which the Olympus has.I love this digital age.

I was looking for a still/hd video camera that could be carried on a belt pouch and not be more than say twice the weight of an A710IS, and small enough to fit when wearing a rain jacket on top. Decent image quality and camera ergonomics was important too.With a CO179EP belt pouch (2oz) the weight for everything incl lenshoodis 22.65oz (using my eat smart scale) which doesn't include a spare battery, if I carry one it's usually in a jacket pocket. The FZ100 fits sideways with the handle on top, and the Lumix neck strap filling the spaces. For use in carry on luggage I purchased a DCB-304 belt pouch which is larger and has more padding, cheaper too. In both cases the lens hood fits in the reversed position on the camera, but you can't just leave it there-it blocks the AF light and tends to move ones fingers going tele to wide angle, does cover the shiny stuff around the lens though which I prefer not to see.As for FZ100 settings, I used these recommended by others (thank you) for both still and 1080i video:P modeIntelligent ISO, max 400Sharpness +2Sat +1Contrast +1NR -2I was pleased with the results and can see printing 10 X 8 's and the next size up occasionally. Viewing on a hd monitor, pictures look great at appx screen image size 12 X 16 and normal viewing distance of 12-16 inches. The pictures tend to fall apart when some magnification is applied though.  If you want to make very large prints don't get this camera.It's obvious that camera support is needed when using video at 600mm, nothing new there. I'm going to look at monopods that are small enough to fit in carry on luggage.Overall I can see why it's a recommended camera for general use/travel/safari, it's small, lightweight, flexible, and fast to get into action, and can be carried all the time.dpreview has a good tool for comparing cameras. Look at the GH2 review as a reference point, you can then plug inthree other cameras for a comparison of jpeg, jpeg high ISO, or raw i.e. FZ100, FZ35, G12. I also like luminous landscapereviews and tutorials. My assessment of the dpreview results is that the FZ100 is OK at the lowest ISO settings only, and that the FZ35 was indeed better at higher ISO values.  Also the GH2 can operate at much higher ISO values and still look OK(also heavier and 3X the price).", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent overall camera", "Author": "Peter Dorfman", "ReviewID": "R2S6VUYFSECZXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been very pleased with this camera.  Both still photos and videos are good quality and the wide range of controls are very useful in taking pictures under different conditions.  For example, it is easy to adjust the exposure to take a picture of an object that is back lit and for which the camera's automatic exposure setting would have underexposed the image.  Aperture and shutter priority modes allow you to set the exposure for as needed although I have found that under most conditions using the program mode is quite sufficient.  In a few cases I have found the manual focus option useful when the auto focus feature was confused by window glass or other objects in the view.The zoom is quite powerful and worked well for me on a recent African safari in which I got some excellent images of animals at distances up to a couple of 100 yards.  At maximum magnification objects are still quite clear and most detail is preserved.The one area in which this camera is very weak is taking pictures in low light.  Even interior pictures taken using ambient light during the evening are so grainy and require such a long exposure time that they are almost useless.  This has the unfortunate consequence that you must use the flash in order to take pictures of most indoor activities except in the brightest lighting conditions.

I am also a great believer in 90% solutions. In other words, 90% of the time I don't need a heavy camera bag and I don't feel like switching heavy lenses. It also turns out that since I tend NOT to have the heavy camera bag with me 90% of the time, I miss many, many great camera opportunities. Therefore, it is with a great dose of realism that I accept the FZ-100 as one of the greatest cameras EVER! It is small and light enough to take along when I would never even consider heavy, cumbersome alternatives. Not only do I give myself the opportunity to capture precious moments, this camera has built-in flexibility and zooming powers that are almost incomparable. All this power in such a small package - what a pleasure. Again, my 90% principle applies also in the need for sophistication when I snap my pictures. I learned, and also observed by reading the specs behind some winning pictures in the magazines, that it is the subject and the photographer's talents that makes pictures unique and such a pleasure to look at. A boring subject and an unskilled can never be improved on by any combination of camera and lenses regardless of price. If my pictures miss 10% of sharpness or color fidelity, the loss is insignificant when compared to their other much more important ingredients. I dare most professionals to tell me how many of their best, most memorable shots could be attributed to over or under exposure, or to a slightly out-of-focus, soft quality of a portrait, etc. The FZ-100 is so comfortable to hold, has such incredible zooming powers and is so user friendly, that I will be quite happy to settle for the 90% solution in this case too. Finally, it may be a great insult to many photographers' ego, but setting the camera to its IA mode will result in such reliable, automated and intelligent exposure decisions that they will feel they are using a point-and-shoot instead of a sophisticated instrument. Imagine, all of this and for well under $400.00!

First of all I want to say that I absolutely love this camera. My husband and I spent several weeks doing research on the best camera for us. Becasue we did so much research we knew what wanted it to have In our new camera...must haves were a  good zoom (more than 20x and not shaky), wanted it to be easy to use but with all the bells and whistles..ie  fast shutter speed..hd movie capability etc and great picture quality. We also wanted to spend under 400. So after several hours on the Internet  cnet.com was a great source of info), at best buy, frys, and wal mart,  and few stops at local camera stores  we narrowed our search. Although we initally considered getting a dslr...we quickly changed our minds because of the price and the need for additional lense (I for one did not want to carry around extra lenses just to take pics..also they can be very heavy and expensive) We were just not  ready to move in that direction. So  we narrowed our search down to three front runners...The Panasonic FZ 150..Nikon Cool Pix P100...and the Nikon cool pix s 9100. As noted the FZ 100 was not one the finalists. But after reading all the reviews about it on amazon and testing the Panasonic FZ 150 out at the store we took a shot and ordered it. We were not disapointed.We eliminated the Nikon P100 after trying it out at the store. The speed of the P100 was much slower and when zoomed all the way it seemed to shake quite a bit....not for us. I was in love with the cool pix S9100. Came in fun colors (like red) and everything I wanted...except it only had a 18 x zoom and when holding the camera it felt well like plastic..cheap a deal breaker in the end for my husband. The Panasonic FZ 150 was great..easy to hold, had many options and did not seam to shake due to a great stabilizing feature. It looked awesome..similar to a dslr..which my husband really liked.So we decided to get the FZ 150 ...but after even more research we found that the FZ 100 had a faster shutter speed..which allows for thoes action shots. So we ordered it instead.  When it arrived I instantly fell in love. So easy to use just like a point and shoot. And the zoom..well amazing. The camera does 1080ip hd movies and has A really cool 15 shot burst mode. It does take a bit to learn all the features..especially if you have never had a camera like this before.

Tran", "ReviewID": "RXCN7D647CTRS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm fairly new to being a beginner photo enthusiast and so have needs that are in the middle of a casual user and someone that is willing to use only a DSLR instead of an advanced point and shoot.  My previous cameras were pocketable point-and-shoots with the most recent one being Lumix ZR-1.  As an upgrade, I had planned on buying a Lumix FZ-35 based on the strength of the reviews on Amazon, but really wanted to find one in a national electronics store so that I could hold it in my hands before buying online.  Unfortunately, I did not have any luck in finding it in any brick and mortar store and so delayed buying it while continuing to compare to other competing models online.  By coincidence, a friend of a friend bought one and that gave me the opportunity to handle the FZ-35.  My first impression was that the FZ-35 looked and felt unexpectedly a little too plasticky and I was a little disappointed, enough so that I did not buy it.  I then read about the FZ-100, which had been released in Asia but was not yet available in the US.  Based on the incredible specs for the FZ-100 over an already excellent FZ-35, I decided to wait for the FZ-100 and ordered it as soon as it became available on Amazon.  My initial impression of the FZ-100 was that the build, fit and finish was excellent, a big difference over my first impression for the FZ-35.  I did not have the opportunity to handle them side by side but this was my distinct impression when I handled them each the first time.I received the camera less than a week before departing for a 10 day trip to Europe and so my first real opportunity to use it was ideal.  My travel companion used a Nikon D40 DSLR during the trip.  Throughout the trip, I was elated with the FZ-100!  Especially useful was the fold out, flip screen which I used constantly.  The incredibly fast burst mode was used frequently as well.  Start up time was very fast, and shutter lag was not an issue.  Compared to the size and noticeably heavier weight of my friend's Nikon, I was thrilled that the FZ-100.  It was so much easier to travel with especially since we were exploring the cities mostly on foot from 10am till 10pm every day.  The Nikon was probably twice as heavy.  I was able to get about 500 shots, mostly without flash, before the battery died.  It felt great to see the FZ-100 in the window of several camera shops in Europe (where it is sold as FZ-45) for approximately $150 more than the U.S. price.  The only slight annoyance was that the removable lense cover did not feel secure.  Several times, I was not sure if it was properly attached and even when properly attached, it felt like it might pop off.At the end of the trip, my friend and I shared our photos.  While I thought that my images were great on the 3\" LCD, and they still looked pretty darn good when viewed on my laptop, they overall did not look as excellent as they did on the 3\" LCD.  This is a testament to the great quality of the 460k dot resolution screen.  Then, in comparison to my friend's images captured on the Nikon, I was dismayed to notice that a good portion of his photos were noticeably sharper than mine, even when we were capturing the same subject.  Part of this may be because I used high zoom frequently, did not use ideal settings (mostly used Intelligent Auto), and of course, the Nikon is a true DSLR, but I was still disappointed.  I was still much happier with the FZ-100 compared to the ZR-1 BUT the major kicker is that at the end of the trip, I noticed that the flip out LCD felt slightly loose when closed.  I am positive that it felt sturdy and tight when new.  To be honest, I think I was so thrilled with the novelty of the swing out LCD, that I used it constantly and fairly carelessly, instead of being more gentle with it.  With just a few days before the 30 day return window ended, I decided to return it, figuring that the looseness would only get worse.  Another annoyance was that the price on Amazon had dropped from $440 to $400 in that 30 day window.  I still give it 4 stars because I was very happy with the versatility, image quality over pocket point-and-shoots, 24x zoom, and burst mode.  However the image quality compared to a DSLR that is only $200 more, and the slightly loose screen were the deal breakers.  I don't think the screen would have been loose if I hadn't frequently carelessly swung it open and shut, and rotating up and down.  But, at the same time, I didn't drop it or bang it around.  If not for the loose screen showing initial signs of wear and tear, I would have kept it.I'm now wavering between a micro four-thirds DSLR, or a beefier Lumix ZS-7, or perhaps leaping to an entry level Nikon DSLR (but can't bear the thought of travelling with it).  I also am convinced that I do not want a model that has a full flip out screen but do want an articulating screen that can angle up and down.  The flip out screen too easily lends itself to unintentionally being careless with it.  I'm also slightly concerned that both Panasonics dropped in price so quickly.  There will always a better model every 3 months so the lesson is to buy it after it's been on the market for at least 3 months and then STOP comparing it to the brand new models so that you can be happy with what you have!", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Shaer", "ReviewID": "R14LTNXVDDSHGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been reading many bad reviews about this camera...But was impressed by the number of people who does not know anything about photography and bought this camera and as a cosequence gave it bad reviews,with all my respect to the other negative fair reviews.This is a great camera if you are aware of it's (fair)limitations...For example this is a zoom camera with small sensor,so if you will use high ISO you will not get a clean image...Don't buy this camera if you don't know the basics of photography or not planning to learn them.I will not go into the pros since you will find them in so many other reviews...Highly recommended and love it.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent bridge camera", "Author": "Costa", "ReviewID": "RG65ZFT226FPP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have Lumix ZS3 and I got this camera as a gift from my Brazilians daughter's mostly for outdoors photos.

Why not check out the competition?  The HD video camera-like features, the many choices of still and video formats, and the 24X zoom were what sold me on this camera.  The pictures I've taken in full zoom, even with digital zoom added, are amazingly crisp and clear.  Birds that could not be identified with quality binoculars, could be identified on my viewfinder screen.  If you want telephoto, but don't want to carry or buy a bunch of lenses, this is the way to go.  For indoor shooting, I was disappointed.  In the dimly lit atmosphere of my son's wedding reception, I missed many good shots because it took so long for it to find the subject it was focusing on.  Flash was ready as I took a picture of my wife dancing with my son.  When it finally took the picture, I got their backs!  This happened often.  I decided to buy a CANON PowerShot SX230HS for my indoor photography, remembering the low light ability of my S3IS.  (see my review of the SX230HS)  On the plus side, when it did focus, the picture quality was excelent.  This camera is definitely a keeper, and I like it, but if I'm going out on the town, I might leave it home and put the smaller CANON in my pocket instead.  Oh yea, a camera of this sophistication won't fit in your pocket.  There's not much you can do about that.

B. Oconnor \"JBOConnor\"", "ReviewID": "R2GW1DAOEG4WQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There's a lot of complaints about the IQ of the photos from this camera and it's all pretty much accurate. It's basically about as good as a cheaper point and shoot.. but it has an awesome lens as opposed to a little 4 or 5 times magnification. For regular 4*6 or 5*8 snapshots though it's fine. It really tries to overcompensate for the noisy images.. even at ISO 100 with judicial noise reduction that can make the jpegs look more like watercolor paintings than photographs. When you print at those mentioned smaller sizes, though, the noise isn't anywhere near as apparent as the smudgy edges created by the internal noise reduction.The video is wonderful, I've been recording at 720p and using the supplied software to convert. My PC is pretty good but there is some jitteriness in playback on the PC I don't see when playing from the camera. I haven't burned a DVD yet, so don't know if.. and assume it won't, transfer to that media.Basically I bought this camera as a backup to my DSLRs and lenses which can be a pain to drag around on day trips and hikes. That and the family was in desperate need of a camcorder since my old SD model is.. well, really old. It does exactly what I wanted it to do and I can't really expect more out of it than what it does. Yes, compared to the photos I can get with my K20D paired up with a $200 or $300 dollar lens the images are wretched, but then again that's why I have that expensive DSLR and lenses. But in the time it takes to swap out the 50mm for the 70-200mm when something pops up unexpected the little FZ100 can capture a couple few dozen shots of the subject. Better a ton of so-so photos than none at all.The RAW format (RW2)of the Panasonic isn't recognized by Photoshop CS4 or earlier (so I've heard, I use CS3).. unless you want to play with the Silkypix program that comes with the camera and save them as tiff files for post processing you'll need to download the Adobe DNG Converter from their website (free) and convert them to DNG files. The raw images are still very noisy but you'll have more to work with in your image programs to pretty them up.You'll never have a photo from your FZ100 adorn the cover of National Graphic Magazine, it's not that kind of a camera. But by dialing back the noise reduction it can give you decent pictures for the family scrap book. Thus far it seems to over expose by a half stop or so in bright conditions, but that's something you can program, too. Despite it's shortcomings it has a wealth of settings similar to what you'd expect in a DSLR to compensate for it's weaknesses.Where it shines is the Zoom, which is officially 24 times magnification but can actually extend to 32 times without any apparent loss to the (ah-hem) quality of the images. The digital magnification goes up to 127x which is always visually challenging but if you need to get a photo of something... it works.Video is another awesome feature. It works great and with a 16GB card in mine it can capture over 2 hours of 720p video. The sound has been very good in the few longer videos I've shot.. all indoors. There are a lot of other bells and whistles regarding the video.. as well as all types of image settings.. but I rarely mess with those types of things. For stills I toss my cameras in Aperture Priority and use the internal meter to make decisions, for video I just point and shoot and hope the camera knows what to do. It comes with a proprietary battery and a charger. I played with the camera for 3 days taking videos, photos, and flash photos and the bars on the power meter only dropped by one (of three).If high quality photography is your primary need for this camera then you might want to look to something with better image reviews, even a lower end DSLR from Pentax, Nikon, etc with a kit lens. The images from the FZ100 aren't going to look very nice if you use them for a 16 by 20 art print on your wall unless you're looking to process it as a digital painting or some such thing. But if you're looking for a fantastic jack of all trades tool that can do an ok job replacing a camera and a bag full of lenses AND your video recorder that fits in a nice, neat little lightweight package then the FZ100 very well may fit the bill.

The video produced was terrible.  First in the HD video you get \"jello jiggles\" anytime you are panning or trying to follow action.  Second, the only speed offered in the high speed was 240 frames per second and at QVGA resolution.  I tried to use the camera to analyze a tennis serve. The pixalization was so extreme that you couldn't see the tennis ball hit the strings.  Terrible quality.I also checked the quality of the still shots.  I was amazed at how bad it was.  I took a picture of my daughter and when I cropped it I found that her hair was just a muddled mass of brown.  Found a reviewer online that pointed out the same problem with any fine detail.  It may offer 14 MP, but you can beat the IQ with 10 MP cameras from all the other vendors.  Oh, and the claimed 11 frames per second was just a claim.  Measured closer to 8 or 9.  Noted in one review that if you only used the RAW pictures you could get better quality.  Of course you have to then convert the RAW to JPG or TIFF if you want to post them or use them. Definitely not a feature, just a work around that takes a lot of work.  This also doesn't help with the poor video quality.The physical camera was great.  Wonderful handling, could take a filter, came with a hood, easy to use.  Too bad they didn't spend a little money on the Image Quality.I had bought a Casio Exlim EX-FH25 Casio EX-FH25 10.1MP High Speed Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Zoom with CMOS Shift Image Stabilization and 3.0 inch LCD first, but it was defective and had to go back.  I thought I would just upgrade to the Panasonic instead trying another Casio.  The Casio had a range of high speed video options and it's resolution and IQ at 240 fps were very usable.  It also offered 120 fps and 60 fps as options (as well as a totally unusable 1,000 fps).  It only offered 720p HD video, but the quality was very good.Comparing pictures and videos taken with the two cameras, the Casio had superior IQ in all of my person samples.  The Casio didn't have some of the handling features of the Panasonic, but it is $100 cheaper. Much better choice if you want a camera to take action pictures.Amazon was great about taking the camera back.  No wonder I buy everything directly from Amazon.

While the battery life, ease of use, and features on the new FZ-100 are well thought out and function well, the images are not consistent and more often than not, poor quality.  We got grainy, out of focus, and erratic exposures more often than not.  I downloaded the latest firmware update and that helped marginally.  Movie mode was exceptional with the camera.  It was almost worth keeping just for that ability alone.  My opinion would be that if you are considering the Panasonic FZ series of camera that you opt for the FZ-40 with the tried and true CCD sensor rather than the unrefined MOS sensor of the FZ-100.

By Amazon and Panasonic. I spent over a month trying to get good shots, thinking that I must of been doing something wrong, when the reality was that the FZ100 is a piece of crap. Actually, for me, It's a $400 paperweight.I've been buying stuff on Amazon for years and in my head I thought that Amazon had a 90 day return policy. when I finally had enough and wanted to return it, I sadly discovered that Amazon's return policy was 30 days and I also realized that the reason it was cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else is because they must have a bunch of them they couldn't sell at $500 and thought that there were still some rubes left in this world like me. Haha!The good thing about me buying this camera on Amazon is that I learned a great lesson and will not buy anymore things like this here. I'll keep buying books and songs, but no more spending over $100 on something here.One more gripe and I'm done.Panasonic seems to have lost their way when it comes to these cameras, they keep trying to turn their cameras into fancy, but cheap HD video cameras, while at the same time they are forgetting that this is a still camera first. If I wanted an HD video camera I would buy one. One that takes much better HD video than their line of FZ's.Forgetting for a moment how bad the pictures were with the FZ100, Panasonic also removed some of my favorite selections in the scene mode. Pinhole, Hi-Speed and Film Grain B&W; are nowhere to be found. I'm not counting that stupid Burst button. They also jerked around with the overall design, moving and adding/subtracting buttons for no real purpose other than to piss you off.I wanted a much improved FZ35 with even more bells and whistles and all I got was an expensive paperweight.In the search for a replacement camera company I've tried 3 different SuperZooms and finally found what I was looking for at my local club store (with a 90 day return policy) and bought a Canon SX40 HS.The SX40 HS is an amazing camera and takes much better pics than any of the cameras I had bought from Panasonic (6) It also has great zoom and a much better image stabilization system.

Some reason two cents worth of electricity could not have been spent charging the battery at the factory? Plus FYI, it did not come with a flash memory card, so add $$ for that.I got a class 6 card for it.  Not sure if that is the reason but this camera takes a picture without all the lag my 2 year old Nikon had.  Another good point is the manual that came with it has a good balance of \"not too much detail but still enough to operate almost everything in about an hour.\"  Also the buttons are very intuitive.

I don't know if this problem due to lens, processor,or the sensor but the pictures are simply not sharp. Let me repeat the FZ100 Lumix doesnot make sharp pictures. If you decide to buy this camera, make sure that you try it outas fast as possible, within the 15 or 30 days return period, because that's exactly what happened to me. I purchase the camera, and start to make pictures, but after a while Istart to realized that what ever setting I make, the camera just wont make/not able to makesharp pictures. It is too late for cash refund after 60 days pass, because my friends thatsexactly what I feel like to do. I guess I'll have to list it on E-bay and buy a regular anycamera that will make sharp pictures.

Costello", "ReviewID": "RNRD4X4Z85RWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For law enforcement purposes, I need to take clear photos of suspects from over 500-yards away. And since I hand-off my photos to others in the field, I need to print my photos on a portable printer with no opportunity for computer software enhancements. For budgetary and practical purposes, the camera also needs to be light in weight, inexpensive and simple to use.While hunting for the best camera meeting my above criteria, I compared the Canon SX10IS, Fujifilm HS10, Nikon P100, Panasonic FZ100 and Canon SX30IS compact zoom lens cameras. I compared these cameras by taking photos of a car license plate from 512-yards (the same car is parked in the same spot all the time). I measured the 512-yard distance with a Bushnell Yardage Pro. At 512-yards, I received the best IQ of the license plate numbers from my SX10IS set at 20x zoom + 4x digital zoom and mounted with a 1.7x TCON teleconversion lens. I mounted the TCON-17 to the SX10's and SX30's 52mm lens filter threads using a 52mm to 55mm step up ring.Although I found that the SX30IS gives me better IQ than the HS10, P100 and FZ100 at distances over 500-yards, the IQ of the SX10IS at these extreme ranges still reigns supreme. I also learned if the Canon SX10IS packs a 20x zoom lens configuration, then the SX30IS seems to be packing no more than 25x at best and not 35x as advertised.Why does the 2-year old SX10IS take better pictures than the new SX30IS from 512-yards away? Don't ask me, it just does.With today's technology, we can't expect any one camera to be everything to everyone, so if you need a camera to take a closeup photo of a war painted tribal chief eating roasted grasshoppers off a banana leaf under triple canopy in low light for a national magazine, then you probably should be packing a Nikon D3X or Canon Mark IV together with your new Canon SX30IS or older SX10IS.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Compare FZ100 with FZ40", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RHADALHD0SKLC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It seems that all comparisons are with the FZ35 while the relevant question is how does this camera compare with the FZ40. I see the 1080i and the articulating viewer are features of the FZ100, but it just does not make sense to come out at the same time with otherwise identical models. I know that the FZ100 is the Leica Lux 2; is that the reason they came out with this model since it was already being produced?  It just seems that for a $40 price differential the FZ40 could be brought out with these two features so why produce what appears to be otherwise identical models in different bodies (if the bodies are different).  I guess one question calls for speculation but the other is a burning question - a comparison between the two current models rather than the discontinued FZ35. Is the 14mp sensor in the FZ40 also going to produce inferior photos then the lower pixel FZ35?", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "You Play the Game to Win and Buy a Camera for Great Photos", "Author": "Michael L Dow", "ReviewID": "R1DCW1CNIY3HRJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "You Play the Game to Win and Buy a Camera for Great PhotosThis Camera has alot of features but it does not matter if the pictures suck.
