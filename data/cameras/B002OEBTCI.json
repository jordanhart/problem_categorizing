{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Pentax K-x is a giant killer!", "Author": "Edgar_in_Indy", "ReviewID": "R3HVS5E9FL417F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from my beloved Olympus e-510 DSLR with the 14-42mm and 40-150mm kits lenses in order to get a DSLR with better low-light performance and HD video capabilities. I loved my Olympus, but image quality took a nose-dive at ISO 800, and I liked the idea of having an HD camcorder built into my camera to capture high quality family photos and home videos in one device. I eventually settled on the Pentax K-x after first buying, and then returning, a Canon T2i.I know that the T2i costs almost twice as much as the K-x, and they're not direct competitors, but I think my experience illustrates what a great camera and bargain the K-x is and how, for me at least, it was a giant killer.I initially pre-ordered a T2i for the $900 MSRP after reading the glowing reviews in the press about the 18MP sensor, the high-ISO performance and the killer 1080p video. When I received the T2i, I was surprised by how cheap and plasticky it felt. It's not that the T2i was likely to fall apart, but my Olympus felt and looked like a higher quality camera, even though it was about $200 less than the T2i when I bought it. I realize that the T2i is a Rebel, but for almost $1000, I expected something more solid.Even worse was the Canon 18-55mm kit lens, which felt like a toy compared to my Olympus kit lenses. It looked cheap, and the zoom action felt very cheap, and you could hear plastic-on-plastic as you zoomed in and out. There was no lens hood included, and the optional lens hood was only about an inch deep and looked ridiculous. The front element rotated when auto-focusing, which makes using some filters problematic, and you had to switch off AF to manually make focus adjustments. My Olympus lenses did not rotate the front element, and allowed full time focus override without turning off AF. And build-wise, they looked and felt like a higher end lens. But worst of all, Canon kits lens's optical performance was lacking, rendering the 18MP sensor moot.I could live with the cheap feel of the T2i body and the ugly jelly-bean design, but I came to realize that in order to get a lens that would match the performance of the body, I would need to shell out another $500 or more, and as a hobbyist I just didn't have the budget.The real deal-breaker with the T2i though, was the use of Quicktime format for the HD video. Quicktime is a proprietary Apple video format, and while I must assume it works well on a new Mac, the QT videos often gave PCs problems. I'd read about this from other users, but I figured that with my high-end PCs and my computer knowledge, I would be okay. But both my new Sony Vaio laptop with Windows 7, ATI 4650 graphics and 4GB of RAM and my desktop computer with Windows XP, dual-core processor, 4GB of RAM, Raptor 10K HDD and nVidia 8800GT graphics would stutter on playback of the 1080p files. And finding affordable programs to edit Quicktime HD video files is another headache. I wasn't about to buy a new Mac just to be able to work with the video from my new camera.So back went the T2i, and my quest for a new camera continued. I was just about to pull the trigger on a Nikon D5000, when I came across the Pentax K-x.The first thing that grabbed my attention was the styling. I thought the red was killer, but I wasn't that brave. And the camera looked dead-sexy in navy blue, but when I saw the white version, I was in love. One thing I liked about my Olympus was that it was something DIFFERENT than all the Nikons and Canon Rebels you see every other parent carrying to school or sports functions. I would often get questions about it from people who didn't realize that Olympus even MADE DSLRs. With this Pentax, I would again have something out of the ordinary.Then I started reading reviews of the K-x. One of the great things about the T2i is the high ISO image quality, and according to the reviews and the sample images I was looking at, the K-x was right there with it.And the K-x also did HD video. There were some limitations, such as 720p and lack of full control over exposure while shooting video, but I didn't really mind since the samples I downloaded looked great, even on my 110\" 1080P home theater projector. And 720p files take less space than 1080p and require less processing power to playback and edit. And best of all, the K-x uses Motion JPEG video format, which plays back great on PCs and is compatible with almost any Windows video editing program. The MJPEG format does use more disk space than the equivalent QT file, but hard drives and SD cards are cheap these days, so it's not a big deal.Another great thing about the K-x is that it has sensor-based image stabilization in the body, so any lens you stick on the camera is stabilized. My Olympus used a similar system, and I was very happy with it. The big advantage is that you can be non-stabilized lenses so they'll be smaller, lighter, and less expensive.I ended up buying the K-x in white with the 18-55mm lens. The K-x looks and feels like a higher quality camera than the T2i, and matches my Olympus in this department. The kit lens is also a very worthy piece of hardware.With the money I saved on the Pentax, I was able to buy the legendary Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 lens, a Pentax 55-300mm zoom lens, and a Sigma speedlight. The flash was new, but I got great deals on the slighty-used lenses on eBay and Craigslist.I've been using the Pentax for a couple months now, and have taken hundreds of pictures. I am absolutely thrilled with the camera and couldn't be happier with the photos and videos I'm getting. The T2i did have just slightly more detail, but other than that I would say the K-x has equal image quality. And the 12MP RAW image files of the K-x are faster to work with than the 18MP files of the T2i and take up much less space on SD cards, so you don't have to worry about filling up nearly as fast.That's not too much negative I can say about the camera. I would like it to have a mini-HDMI port and a standard mini-USB port, and continuous auto-focus would be nice in video mode, but no other DSLR has that yet. Stereo mics would also be nice.I suspect that the image stabilization system may not be as good as the one in my Olympus, but I can't say for sure since my 300mm is longer than the telephoto I had with the Olympus and will therefore be more prone to shake.I get compliments on the Pentax everywhere I go, and it's been a joy to use and own. I could not be happier with my purchase.In the future I'll probably add a Sigma 30mm F1.4 prime and a Sigma 10-20mm ultra-wide zoom to my lens kit.Just for the record, I'm not trying to bash on the T2i. It is an amazing camera that is currently without peer in its price range. But if you're like me and you only have about $1000 to spend, I think you will get much more value by going with a less-expensive but almost-as-capable camera like the K-x, and using the extra money on high quality lenses. My F2.8 constant-aperture lens has been a revolution for me, and I recommend every budding photographer make room in their budget for something similar.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great DSLR, I couldn't be happier.", "Author": "James M.

I will occasionally still get a blurry or under/overexposed photo which I assume is somehow my fault but overall the auto setting just seems to work.  I do get alot more pictures of my 3 year old's smiling face because it focuses so much faster than my old camera.  I am just starting to use some of the more advanced features but I used some of the filters only a day or two after first trying it.  They were very easy to use, actually, the whole camera is very intuitive.I am not a professional photographer. I imagine there are things the camera can't do but I don't know what.  The shake reduction seems to work really well and battery life is really good as long as you don't do a lot of movies or live view.  The battery indicator was a bit wacky but I updated the firmware and it is fixed.In a nutshell, worth every penny.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera with a Few Flaws", "Author": "Bradford \"oneiros11\"", "ReviewID": "R191DUOJWVF1PM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded to the K-X from a Panasonic FZ50.  I wanted a lightweight camera that could shoot in low light.  (I purchased the 50-200mm kit, since this telephoto is significantly lighter than the 55-300mm.)  I was drawn to the K-X's low noise profile at high ISOs.  The first thing I noticed upon using the camera is that the K-X is very responsive and fast.  The controls and menus are intuitive and very easy to navigate.Image Quality:  I was pleased with the first images out of the camera, letting the K-X choose the exposure values.  Good clarity, exposure, white balance, and color value. No discernible chromatic aberration.  I have also used shutter mode when I want a narrow depth of field.  The camera seems to create a pleasing bokeh.  In scenes with flowers and fruit stalls, the colors are rich and vivid.  The in camera digital filters were an unexpected treat.  You can get creative with this camera w/o resorting to Photoshop.  I shoot a lot of landscapes, and K-X produced decent results.  Compared with my earlier camera, the K-X seems to have a much wider dynamic range.  The relatively brighter sky does not cause the camera to underexpose the land.  I have some questions about the white balance and color space in landscape work.  However, with some tweaking via the accompanying Pentax Digital Camera Utility software, I have been satisfied with the results.  While exploring this, I noticed that I actually prefer the default color space to Adobe RGB, which suggests that Pentax has worked hard to produce a pleasing image right out of the camera.  The supplied software seems very flexible compared to an earlier version of Silky Pix.  I love the fact that I can modify the white balance and exposure value of JPEGs, in addition to the other processing options.  The software would be enhanced if one could use it to apply the camera's digital filters.  Then you wouldn't have to drain the battery to let the camera do the processing.  Another enhancement would be to include a digital grad filter.  But perhaps this is too much to expect.One of the features of this camera is that it can combine multiple images to create an HDR.  I use HDR a great deal in my work.  However, the HDR images from this camera seemed lifeless and washed out - especially the stronger HDR2.  I will continue to experiment with this, but probably will stick with combining images in the HDR software I use.One flaw that may point to less than optimal factory conditions that K-X seems to suffer from dust issues.  The first camera I received showed multiple spots on the images after I changed the lens in very clean, indoor conditions.  I returned this camera, and the second camera immediately showed  dust inside the viewfinder, which thus far I have been unable to remove.  The dust removal system did remove some other dust that appeared on the sensor.  While the viewfinder dust does not affect the image, it was annoying to see it there on the first day of use.  After reading about DSLRs and dust, I have picked up a Giotto Rocket Blaster, which is a tool that can be used to blow dust off the sensor.  Since the Panasonic had a fixed lens, dust was never a problem.Pros:Low noise at high ISOLight weight - even with 50-200mm lensIn camera digital filters can unleash your creativityExcellent quality imagesWide Dynamic RangeGood valueCons:Battery LifeHDR washed outDust issuesBottom Line:  So far I am happy with my K-X.

I won't go into all the specs or usage there are plenty of reviews out there to read. I will just say that from my experience as a 1st time DSLR user this has been a great camera, easy to use and the pictures look great (even my photographer friends have mentioned how good the images look). It's worth it to get the 2 lens kit if it is close in price to the 1 lens kit which it usually is.  Another great thing about this camera is a lot of the features like antishake and some of the autofocusing features are built into the camera body as opposed to the lens like some other DSLRS, this combined with the universal K-mount means that it is really easy to find great old lens on ebay that will work perfectly with this camera. I got a very nice older 50mm Pentax prime lens for $20 on ebay, just popped it on and it worked seamlessly. Nice.", "Date": "January 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good camera for the price", "Author": "Rayaz", "ReviewID": "R2D7BMKJ93QOSB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After many years of point of shoot i had slowly started to get interested in the topic.  With the arrival of our first child I suddenly realized my standard point and shoot cameras were rather unsuited for taking photos of the small fellow on the move, and also the picture quality was rather grainy under low light.  I was very keen on the Canon G11 but the lack of a decent video recording capability was putting me off, plus the rather high price.I then managed to get my hands on an Olympus E420 DSLR and then found how much faster it was in focusing and shooting, and the fact that even with its smaller than other APS-C DSLR sensors the picture quality was much better, and the need to use the flash was reduced. However the lack of any form of image stabilization bothered me, as i could not get the shutter to anything less than 1/60, and it also had some major low light focusing issues.However the brief exposure to the DSLR meant i was definitely set on a DSLR and the choice was between the Nikon D5000 (one lens) and the Pentax K-x (2 lens kit) as these were the one's close to my budget.  However during that period the D5000 was having a known hardware issue with its on-off, and i decided i will go with the K-x as the reviews stated it was a good match, and the fact that the prices were so much lower even with two lenses was also an advantage.  I sadly had to opt fo rthe 50-200mm, as the prices of the 300mm spiked up during the time i purchased making it beyond my budget, but i think that was one big mistake i made!!The wider kit lens 18-55mm performs very nicely, and the picture quality is quite sharp and clear.  However the 50-200mm is a rather pathetic lens, and i see why a lot of reviews recommend people to avoid this and go for the 300mm, which i had done so!!!The K-x camera per say is super, with loads of features.  Initially i experienced the problems with the rechargeable batteries, which was rectified after i upgraded the firmware.  The next issue was that built-in image stabilization seemed very poor, so much so that i could not even get blur free photos at shutter times i had been able to with the Olympus E420. Considering that my day use camera was then the Panasonic ZS3 which could do even 1/4 sec handheld this was very disappointing.  However the firmware fix also seemed to have an impact, along with the fact that i had also to learn to grip the camera properly, and combined i now can even get blur free photos at 1/8sec using the wide angle lens.The nicest thing about the camera is its low light ability, where pictures even with ISO1600 comes out pretty well, and for landscape photos you can even go further, and all this with kit lenses.  I also managed to get hold of an old Pentax K55 manual 55mm lens over 15+ years old and it works perfectly with the body.  The advantage of the in-body image stabilization meaning that it works even for old lenses!!! This lens is much faster (f 2.0) and this means i can now take photos with no flash even under poor light, the only problem being the lack of a wide angle.  This also means i definitely will be getting myself a faster lens possibly with a macro capability.The focusing of the camera is pretty good, but under low light you will have to switch to manual mode as the auto mode tends to struggle a wee bit (compared to a D90 i tried out recently).  The lack of the AF points on the viewfinder is a bit of a bummer, though you can get away using center AF in most cases, but it does mean that if you want to take very precise control this is problem (you can use live view mode to do this, but live view as in the case of most new DSLR is rather slow).The HD video is very good, as the low light capabilities of the camera sensor definitely becoming an asset.  The Panasonic ZS3 i have is considered one of the best point and shoot for video, and comparing the video from the K-x is a bit grainy but a lot sharper and detailed.  However the audio quality is very poor compared to the ZS3.  One thing i would have loved pentax to do better is to use a different codec for the video, as the current codec is very inefficient and you have MASSIVE video files even for short recordings.I must also not forget that the camera has loads of features for effects, and the HDR capability (which i have not used much to date).  While some may not be happy with the AA batteries, the fact that AA batteries can be purchased easily is a boon if you forget your spare batteries or loose them.  However the AA batteries definitely add a substantial weight to the camera, though using lithium AA batteries reduces the bulk (however these batteries are costly so i use the trust sanyo enelopes).  Would be great if pentax can make the battery door a bit more sturdy, as it tends to jiggle around a bit.In case you want to check out some photos i have taken using this camera, check our [...] where i have uploaded some of my takes.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "So happy!", "Author": "Angy \"angyeliz\"", "ReviewID": "R1LI6TOE51HNV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR so I didn't want to spend a fortune but at the same time I didn't want something that would be a waste of money.

Wong", "ReviewID": "R2SXI1LSB7M1F1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok, I am going to balance this a little. I had a Nikon D40, loved it, but got stolen. I saw this deal on deals2buy.com to get this pentax (plus the 50mm-200mm lens) at $560+ through the Dell website. Due to all the rave positive reviews of the k-x, I bought it! In fact, I think a reviewer actually said say that he \"upgraded\" from his D40 to this, so I thought wow, great price! $560 for a DSLR bundle with 50-200mm lens! The Nikon 50mm-200mm costed me $200 alone!After I received this this Pentax, I understood why people say this is a big bang for the buck. It has so many features that the D40 doesn't have, live view, video mode, all the fancy editing stuff, even HDR! BUT! The picture quality just can't match my previous D40! Yes, the Pentax has iso all the way to 6400, it goes down to iso 100 where the D40 stops at 200. But I think you will be pretty frustated with the Pentax because the focusing is really slow... I swap over to the 55-200mm pentax lens, tried to snap pictures of some birds. I can't! The focus is too slow! The birds either flew away by the time the focus is set, or when I snap it, they have moved and I ended up with a blurred picture. Even with the 18-55mm lens, the focusing is way longer than my D40! Next test, I took the Pentax out for a night shoot with my tripod at some of my favorite locations in the city. Took out my note book and set the K-x to all the previous settings I used with my D40, took the same set of pictures using my previous D40 settings. I placed the photos on my PC, and compared side by side with those pictures I took with my D40. Nope, the D40 won hands down.Final final test, I bought the Nikon D3000 with 18-55mm + 50-200mm bundle (both are VR lens). It costed me $660 from RitzCamera (through Amazon), Yes, I paid additional $100 for a camera that has less features than the Pentax just to convince myself it is not my imagination that an entry level Nikon is better than this entry level Pentax... Now, I let my wife use both cameras and start shooting stuff in her kitchen in automatic mode. She is the type who prefers point and shoot cameras, and thinks that the DSLRs are too complicated for her. After she is done shooting her microwave, iron, etc... I placed both sets of photos on the PC screen, without telling which set of photos were taken by which camera, I asked her to pick the better pictures taken by her. 8 out of 10 times, she picked the photos taken by the D3000. So, if a housewife who knows nothing about using DSLR can tell the differences between pictures taken by a D3000 vs. the K-x, I think I am convinced that I should be selling my K-x on Craglists. Since it was listed at $700 here, I sold my \"used K-x\" for $600, not bad considered that I bought it only $560... :)Yes, yes, I know, some of you probably grumbling right now that I haven't push the K-x to the limit, haven't picked the extreme conditions when I will appreciate the functions of the K-x. But what I am trying to say is this, if you want fancy stuff, you really get a lot of it from the K-x. If this is what you are looking for, go get the K-x. But if you want good quality pictures without having to kill yourself over the slow focusing, or IF you have used the D40 before, the K-x ain't an upgrade!Lastly, even if you are going to get the Pentax, and you are intending to get it with teh 50-200mm bundle for $699? You have been ripped off! Go deals2buy.com and wait for the promotion, I got it for only $560 for the whole bundle!And if you want to get the D3000 + 200mm lens, go Ritzcamera's website and get the bundle for $650!

About 3 years old now, the PowerShot S5 IS is starting to malfunction:  the dreaded \"lens error\" message appears when using the zoom (started about a year ago), and now a stuck pixel appears in pictures.  So, I knew it was time to find a replacement.My original plan was to get another prosumer point and shoot, such as the Canon SX30 IS.  But at the ~$400 price point, it was edging pretty close to some entry-level dSLRs.  Sure, having that 35x zoom would be nice, but I realized that with the Canon SX30 IS, I'd almost certainly be getting the same sorts of 'drawbacks' I had been experiencing since my first Canon digicam:  poor low-light performance, slow focus, and slow charging of the flash.  By the way, over the years I've learned that \"low-light\" really means \"indoors,\" even under conditions that look fairly well-lit to the human eye.  That lesson translated into one of the key determinants for making my final decision:  almost any camera can take nice photos outside in daylight, it's taking photos indoors that don't look washed out by a flash or so dark you can't see anything that is the real test--that is, if you take lots of photos indoors.After reading many reviews for entry-level dSLRs on popular digital photography sites, I found the Pentax K-x highly rated.  What seemed to be a common theme across these reviews was the claim that this camera had very good low-light sensitivity.  Well, I can definitely attest to that!  I've been shooting pictures indoors that look, well, like what you see with your own eye, even when using the flash!  If you're interested in this camera, I'd recommend reading the many fine reviews out there written by professionals.Perhaps it's the result of transitioning to a dSLR, but gone are the delays in focusing, and the built-in flash charges very quickly.  (Interesting note:  both the Canon S5 IS and Pentax K-x use 4 \"AA\" batteries, yet the Canon takes SO much longer to charge the flash.  How many shots I missed because of that!)  This camera also has a priority mode that I hadn't seen before, but absolutely love:  sensitivity priority \"Sv\".  Basically, you set the ISO sensitivity, and the camera determines the aperture and shutter speed settings.  Others might not find this feature as worthwhile as I do, but in all my struggles to get my Canon cameras to take decently exposed photos indoors, I knew the battle was always against the ISO sensitivity, and anything past 400 was an invitation for blurry, speckled shots.  With the K-x, I've taken indoor shots at ISO 1600 rivaling those at ISO 200 on my Canon P&S;'s.Now to be fair, there are some negatives to mention.  First, the AUTO mode on the camera worked so poorly indoors I almost returned the camera.  Solution:  use any other mode and the camera comes to life!  Second, there are no AF points in the viewfinder.  For me, that hasn't been much of a problem, because I never had them before (coming from point & shoots), and there are advanced AF settings to work around this if you absolutely need to.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "A superior value for entry/mid-level DSLR's", "Author": "Suzy's Owner", "ReviewID": "RMRY5DXEX73PE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We researched DSLR's extensively before deciding which one to purchase, and we do not regret choosing the K-x!  This is our first DSLR, so it was important that the camera be user-friendly for beginners and still be able to grow with us as we learn more about photography.Before purchasing the K-x, we debated between the Nikon D5000, Sony Alpha A230, Canon Rebel XS, and Canon Rebel T1i.  Going down the list of specifications, the K-x was the best choice for pretty much everything - especially once price was factored in.  We couldn't find anyone in our area who has used a Pentax DSLR, so we had to rely on web reviews to compare it to the Canons, Sony and Nikon.  We played with the other DSLR's in the camera shops before buying our camera, but couldn't find any Pentax's in the camera shops near us.  When we finally got our camera, we decided the Pentax did really well by comparison.First, the \"Auto\" mode on this camera is not the best of the entry-level cameras.  If that's the setting you prefer, the Rebel T1i is the better camera.  However, if you're comfortable adjusting the white balance, aperture, shutter, etc, this entry-priced camera will seem more like a mid-range camera.  Since we learned how to use it, we've taken great pictures with the K-x!  The white balance settings have a great range for portraying accurate colors, there is little noise at high ISO, and the two lenses are all you need for most situations.One thing we weren't expecting (but is apparently pretty common) was a dirty sensor right out of the box.  Our camera had one really large particle and a bunch of smaller specks that spotted most of our pictures the first few weeks.  Cleaning the sensor is an easy fix, but it'll cost you $40 or more if you don't know how to do it yourself.  The dust on the sensor isn't really a knock against Pentax or Amazon, it's just a side-effect of shipping that you should be aware of.Speaking of Amazon and shipping...we got the camera in 3 days using standard shipping - a day earlier than expedited shipping was predicted to deliver.

A solid DSLR that wouldn't break the bank. It has all the basic features I wanted in a camera and takes beautiful pictures. Sometimes I do find myself wishing I had gone with a K-7 or something nicer, but the price tag quickly turns me away.The bundled software is pretty much useless because Picasa 3 is better and free. Image stabilization isn't great, shooting in the dark (or even low light) requires a tripod. ISO sensitivity unlock is nice, even though it doesn't look great above 3200 you can at least take pictures that you otherwise couldn't.It has a nice feel to it, a good heft. The grip is rubberized. The menu and interface is pretty simple, I picked it up in just a matter of hours. The pack I purchased came with a wide angle and a telephoto lens, I would recommend getting something similar.So yes, awesome value, great entry level camera, I would recommend to anyone considering photography.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just buy it.

After many years with film cameras, I decided to move into my favorite brand: Pentax.  I was not dissapointed, the quality of the pics is excellent. As you may know, the quality of the pics depends on the quality of the lens. The kit lens that come with the camera are good and produce good pictures.  I cannot wait until I buy better lenses.  The only setback I see that does not really affect the quality of the pictures is that I cannot tell what item is focussed at all times.  I had purchased a bunch of additional lenses and hoods in Amazon that are way cheaper than the original item with the Pentax name.  I am satisfied with the purchased.

The image quality became more and more important to me especially with the increase of mega-pixels since image noise is more evident. My Pentax DSLR is very different in positive and negative ways. On the positive side I am thrilled about the responsiveness of this camera and i realized that I've been missing this on the point and shoots especially when it comes to flash recharge time or shot to shot lag. The KX is exceptional in every aspect such as auto focus, shutter lag and continuous shooting. The HD video is a bonus but is a bit awkward to use since the zooming is not very smooth and you have to focus manually. The jelly  effect is also evident. I'd love to have a dedicated movie button tho. On the negative side to me compared to my older super-zooms is the fact that you have to change the lenses to suit your shooting situation. I still have to get used to it. I know there are super zoom lenses like the Tamron 18-270 but indoors they are not very fast. I guess that also goes for the 18-55 kit lens. The 18-55 and 50-200 kit lenses really produce good quality images. They are the sharpest between f 5.6 and f9 to my experience. The shutter sound is a bit on the loud side, I can no longer take silent images but it's a matter of getting used to it. The size of the camera does not bother me, I think it's decent for an APS-C sized sensor DSLR. I know some are not happy with the fact that the KX uses AA batteries but I can say that stick with Eneloops and they'll do a very good job. I probably shot between 400-600 images on one charge. The good thing about them is that they don't lose their charge as ordinary NiMh rechargeable. The camera does not come with video cable so if you are planning to play your images and videos on the TV you'll have to purchase one separately. Overall it's very exciting to learn about DSLR's, the image quality is exceptional, my FZ35 on ISO 400 was producing the noise level of ISO 3200 of the KX. This is not to make the FZ35 look bad, as a point and shoot is the best you can get in my opinion, I'm just trying to illustrate the difference between the image quality due to the sensor size. This camera is great to start with since is more beginner friendly with scene mode shooting options and a pretty good Auto mode.

I am a first time dslr owner, and did extensive research before choosing Pentax. It came down to a choice between the Pentax K-X and the Canon T1i. What ultimately got me picking Pentax over the Canon was the price performance, in-body stabilization, video, and high ISO count. Moreover, when I went into my local electronics store and held the two models in my hands, the Pentax felt like the more comfortable camera. It has a sturdy grip, a good weight without being too heavy, and a capture-mode wheel that spins 360 degrees (which is such a sensible thing to have that I can't believe most DSLRs don't).My pictures are, obviously, a vast improvement over my previous point and shoot. The camera handles well and has a very natural feel to it -- I had it out of the box and shooting pictures within the hour. The layout itself makes a lot of sense for first time users, but I also get the sense that this is a camera with the ability to grow with me. A more experienced photographer friend (and Canon user) played with my camera's manual settings and said that he liked what he saw.In summary: I love this camera. I'm thrilled that I bought it. If you are a first time DSLR buyer like I was, I'm sure that you are splitting hairs right now trying to figure out what camera to buy. Whatever you choose, you'll likely be happy with.

I investigated canons and nikons, but finally I came to the conclussion that this is the BEST camera in this price range for the features it has.I love taking pictures with the pentax kx, they come out very polished and with a great quality. Auto function es very good, although I never use that feature, because if you want EXCELENT photographs, you have to learn to use it in manual, if that is not the case and you want to take pictures on the go, it will be best buying a more portable camera like a sony cybershot or canon powershot.My friends and I have made very good (not perfect) short films with my camera, I record all my guitar videos with the pentax kx and they all are very nice with a great quality in high definition. One thing I noticed firt in this type of cameras is that they usually just take pictures (in this price range). But the PENTAX KX doesnt just record video, but it can record video in intervals of 25 min each, where more advance cameras like canon rebel t3i can only record for 12 consecutive minutes (according to the information provided from a friend who has one of those).One of these days I noticed a dead pixel on the screen of my camera :(...BUT dont worry! this camera has a function that is called pixel mapping and repairs dead pixels; also, it has sensor cleaning and dust removal.The lenses that come with the camera are very useful, except for the telephoto lens(50 -200mm) in the case you want to take pictures of nature in a too professional way, but it is great for portrait pictures. If that is not the case, you better buy a telephoto lens like the sigma 70-300 mm.This camera is great for long exposure photographs like photos of the night sky and HDR photography. Also, I recommend buying filters, mostly the polarizer because is a great addition to the repertory of an amateur photographer.I hope this little review help you in entering the world of professional photography like I did.
