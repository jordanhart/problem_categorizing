{"Reviews": [{"Title": "\"Huge accessories package\" is CHEAP TRASH!", "Author": "S. E. Kirk \"DragonMaster\"", "ReviewID": "R3DBND5Q4F1YZV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received my order a couple weeks ago and was happy at the time because it came in only 11 days from the time I ordered it instead of the estimated month to a month and a half.  I then gave a 5 star review regarding my order and as requested by your company in order to receive a free gift.  I am very happy with the camera and the two Nikon lenses but the rest of it leaves much to be desired.  Upon closer inspection of my order afterwords I came to realize that it was missing an item that was supposed to be part of the package, to be specific, the mono pod did not come with the delivery.  Also, I was not aware as it was not made clear that the Huge Accessories Package consisted of all Zeicos products which I have found to be very cheap and of very poor quality.  The camera bag began falling apart two days after I got it and felt very cheap to begin with.  I hadn't even taken it anywhere yet, all I had done was put the camera and lenses in it.  I have since ordered a much better and higher quality bag from another company.  The 2X Telephoto is worthless because it distorts any pictures so badly.  The tripod is very flimsy and is very dificult to set the camera in whatever position desired.  The tabletop tripod is so small I wouldn't even trust my small point and shoot camera on it.  Perhaps in order to prevent some customer dissattisfaction in the future you should specify in your product descriptions what brand the items are so that your customers and make informed decissions about their purchases.  You may also want to include better quality products in your packages instead of products that are so poorly made that they are useless to begin with or fall apart in a couple of days.  Had I known at the time I gave my review I would have given a 2 star and only that high because I love the camera and Nikon lenses.  I will most likely not be doing business with Sunset Electronics again and I will recomend the same to my friends and family and anyone else who asks as well.  Putting trash products in your packages to make it look like a great deal is no way to do business and is certainly no way to keep your customers happy and purchasing from you instead of someone else.  FYI, I still haven't received the promised free gift for my 5 star review that I gave at least 3 weeks ago.  I don't really care if I get it because I am sure it is probably another peice of cheaply made trash.  I hope you actually read this and change how you conduct your business so that others don't get screwed the way you screwed me.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but junky other stuff", "Author": "Jeffrey Pacetti", "ReviewID": "R2T6TLQ4ZL9Q0V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, the camera and lenses are excellent and I couldn't be happier with them.Regarding the other package contents: I wanted to have a back-up battery, monopod, back-up memory card, and flash, so I went with this package.  I expected the accessories to be of low quality and I was right.  It probably would have been best if I had simply bought the 3-4 accessories I wanted separately so they would have been better made.  The monopod, batteries, and memory card were fine.  However, the flash is a complete waste as it can't be synched to the camera so any pictures utilizing it come out well over-exposed.  The wide angle and other lense I will probably never use (not to be confused with the 55mm and 200mm Nikon lenses, which are fantastic).I would suggest this camera and lenses to anyone considering them.  However, skip this package deal of junky accessories.  I'm not a super camera guy and even I thought they were pretty lame.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Parts might not be original", "Author": "Joshmybench", "ReviewID": "R2LVIK0XVTSH7C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the battery used in this as told by a professional nikon spare parts retail shopkeeper are not original.

For about the cost of the D90 and one lens at my local retailer, this package is everything someone needs to get started or take their photography to the next level.

They ran out of them and could not them.  The seller offered to give me several memory cards instead.  I took them since I was going to buy a different camera bag.  4 star.I did not receive the warranty cards with this camera and lenses.  The seller told me that they keep them for service.  Why would they do this.  1 star.Yes the Lenses are standard items, but the 18-55mm started to not focus properly with in the warranty period.  Tried to have fixed though the Nikon service center.  They told me it would cost over $100 dollars.  I told them it was under warranty and they said maybe so but I did not have the original warranty card.  So I had to resend lens to the seller.  They looked at it and then sent it to the same place for repair that I originally sent it to along with the original warranty card which they kept on file.  I needed the lens back for a event that week and the seller told me they would just send me a new lens. Received the lens the day before I needed it.
