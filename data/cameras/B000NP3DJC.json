If you own a 10D then the choice is pretty easy, as you get extra MP plus new features. However, what if you own the XT, is this a worthwhile upgrade? The answer is that it depends if you need the new features. Based on my personal experience, however, the answer is a resonating yes!Also, if you are trying to decide between buying the XT or the 20D, take a look at the 30D. The 30D offers a great combination of features that you won't find in those two cameras.SIZE MATTERS: yes my hands are big and I don't like holding the XT. In fact, that's what made the 20D appealing back when I was shopping for my first digital SLR, but it didn't offer much more than that. On the other hand, the 30D size is perfect with a much solid feel than my XT and I get more features with the 30D.BIGGER LCD: The new 2.5 inch LCD screen (up from 1.8) is so much better than the one on the XT. Now I can look at the picture I have taken and actually see some details. That's very important because it cuts down on nasty surprises that I couldn't otherwise spot while shooting with the XT.IMAGE PARAMETER: is awesome! I know how to set parameters on my XT to suit the shooting situation (portrait vs. nature for example). However, many of my friends who own the XT don't bother to make any changes. With the 30D, however, changing the parameters is as easy as dialing in what you are shooting. You set it on portrait and no more over saturated pictures of your friends! This new feature makes the professional level 30D extra friendly for amateurs.1/3 ISO STOPS: That new feature makes taking test shots with the 30D much more enjoyable than with the XT. Hence, no more soft images with low shutter speed or too much depth of field with high aperture. Instead you can sacrifice an extra 1/3 stop of ISO and achieve correct exposure!Aside from those four great improvements there are few nice features here and there. As for all other aspects of photography, like auto focus and light metering for example, this camera will not disappoint you. It beat my XT in every aspect, except price! Therefore, if you are comfortable making the investment get this camera, it rocks!PS. ABOUT THE KIT LENS: I personally don't like the kit lens because it focuses slowly, renders colors poorly, and produces marginally sharp pictures. I say marginaly because it's a shame to couple the awesome 30D with such a low performance lens. Instead I would buy the body only and invest few hundred dollars in an excellent prime or a decent zoom. If you are new to photography, however, and not sure what to buy instead of the kit lens consider buying the 50 1.8 Canon lens along with the kit lens. That lens will serve as a good reference point for what you are missing by using the kit lens. Furthermore, the 50 mm lens goes for only $70 new. Use both lenses, learn the difference, and from there decide if it's worth it for you to buy different lenses.  Good luck either way.UPDATE APRIL 6: The 30D auto focus is superior to the Rebel XT. Generally speaking when I am out shooting in the forest preserve I make sure I take few exposures of the same scene without changing the composition. I do that because very often the camera would focus on the wrong object and render my pictures useless. The 30D on the other hand is better it focuses on the right object more often. It's just \"smarter\" in focusing, which mean that now I can take pictures of more scenes with my 512MB memory card. Prior to that, I had to fill up the card with multiple pictures of the same scenes.UPDATE APRIL 30: Three new features have come in handy so far. Those are spot metering, controls layout, and ISO display in the viewfinder.SPOT METERING: can be very useful in taking landscape images. From my experience, the evaluative metering found on the XT and 20D (more so in the XT) tends to create over exposed pictures in tricky situations. I usually take few exposures that are underexposed to combat this. Now with this new feature I can point at the object of interest, obtain an exposure reading, and then recompose and take my picture based on that reading. Thanks to spot metering this new approach provide accurate results and is much more convenient than filling up the memory card with several exposures of the same scene.CONTROLS LAYOUT & ISO DISPLAY: Those two new features go hand in hand, as it's very easy to use the two wheels on the back and on the top of the camera to change settings that most important of which is (yup you guessed it) ISO speed. Once you change the ISO speed you will see the speed value being illuminated in the viewfinder, truly a piece of mind!", "Date": "April 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "IMO, STILL the best buy for the money!", "Author": "JanSobieski", "ReviewID": "R2KJY4FRC191J8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera offers a few well considered improvements over the 20D it replaces.  The sensor and processor are the same so the image quality will not differ one iota, BUT an enlarged LCD monitor, spot metering, vastly improved shutter life and ISO displayed on the viewfinder are worthy improvements easily justifying the upgrade from the 20D.  If one is considering an upgrade from the 10D my advice would be to definitely go for it.  The 20D and 30D both have the \"instant on\" feature and this represents a vast improvement over the 10D. The 10D was felt by many to have focusing issues and though I did not have any significant problem with my 10D in that regard the 30D represents a substantial improvement in this area. Canon still is not offering (in this price range) a camera with eye control or 45 focusing points, BUT the nine focusing points that ARE offered are well placed and the camera focuses quickly and surely resulting in tack sharp photos.The pictures this camera takes are simply beyond belief. Beautifully saturated, tack sharp, NO, and I mean NO noise at 400 or below and barely discernible noise all the way up to 1600 ISO. For all practical purposes 1600 ISO is an entirely usable speed resulting in fantastic pictures. What Canon has accomplished in reducing noise and increasing pixel density proves that they are, for now, the technology leader.  Canon for now is doing a better job at controlling noise than Nikon though Nikon with the D200 comes pretty darn close except at 800 ISO and above.The new flash system, ETTL II, available first on the 20D is a vast improvement over previous systems.  The in camera processing results in exceptional and pleasing pictures. This camera has a fixed continuous shooting rate which was not present on the 20D.  The megapixels stay constant at 8.2 million pixels.  Many may be disappointed that the MP count was not increased and feel that perhaps a nominal increase to 10MP would have better justified an upgrade.  Canon obviously feels that noise and other features are more important at this point than raw MP's and I would agree.  The holy grail of digital photography is now dynamic range.  And while this camera offers no improvement in dynamic range I think we can expect to see such improvements in future offerings from Canon and the other manufacturers.One of the greatest things about digital photography is the ability to build a digital dark room for next to nothing. With the included Photoshop Elements you are well on your way to producing pictures that you could only have imagined in the pre-digital days. I am able to recoup pictures that I never would have considered salvageable before this camera.  And while Elements is a great program and more than adequate for most needs I would recommend considering Photoshop CS2 for those who intend to plumb the depths of this hobby.Another thing I like about Canon is the lens system which IMO is second to none. Also, Canon continues to innovate at a furious pace driving the price of these digital cameras relentlessly downward.  This camera is being introduced at a lower price than either the 10D or the 20D.  The 5D is plummeting in price and is approaching my \"strike point\" for purchase.  I expect that we will see a sub $2000 10 MP camera with a full frame sensor in the next 18 months.  Such are the economics of digital photography.  It would seem that Moore's law is driving the prices down inexorably.So, I LOVE the 30D!  LOVE Canon. And LOVE digital.

I wanted to move from film (EOS-3 and EOS-1V) to D-SLR and have waited many years to do so.  I could neither justify $4K or $8K for the two high-end cameras either for cost or use.  Then the 5D came out and I seriously considered it because it was a true pro-level camera for photographers truly not in the business.  And, it has a FF CMOS to boot--no FOVCF to deal with.Then, Canon brought out the 30D and after doing the comparative homework, the quality is, for the most part, equal and sometimes better than the 5D.  For those of us who are not in possession of 300mm+ lenses, the 1.6 FOVCF is super, except, of course, for ultra-wide FOVs.But camera to camera, function to function, versatility to versatility, or any other category you might wish to compare, the 30D is a superlative camera and a photographer's dream.  This camera is truly \"WOW! to the MAX.\"For those who think that having a pop-up flash should NEVER be on a pro level camera, think again!  It's a true plus.  With 5FPS for use at sporting events or other fast-moving venues vs. 3FPS for the 5D, this makes the 30D all the better.So, the 30D along with the unbelievable EF-S10-22mm f/2.5-3.5 USM lens, the EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM, the EF70-200mm f/2.8L IS UMS, the EF100 f/2.8 macro USM, the Battery Grip BG-E2, the Speedlite 580EX along with the Macro Ring Lite MR-14EX and/or the Macro Twin Lite MT-24EX, which is the total equipment I have in my bags, you can't do better.Oh, I am sure Canon will soon come out with a 40D, but I can't imagine what they could add without moving to the 5D level-camera.  In fact, we may soon see the demise of the SLR with less than a FF CMOS, so I advise that if you want the advantages of the 1.6 multiplier SLR, get this camera now.  Don't wait; there's no reason to do so and at $1500 give or take, it's very inexpensive for what Canon gives us in return.What I have not told you is that I purchased both the 30D and the 5D and returned the 5D--for the reasons I iterated above.  And I don't regret it, even for a minute.Nikon can't come close to this camera.  There are far more Nikon to Canon convertees than Canon to Nikon and it's for cameras like the 30D that has caused this to occur.  Friends of mine that were diehard Nikonites are now Canonites.

I love the professional features that the XT lacked, and the 30D also feels much more solid. It balances much better with Canon's professional lenses, and the 2.5\" screen makes more of a difference than I thought it would.The only negative point is that the 1.6x lens magnification factor robs my 24-70 f/2.8L lens of its wide angle capabilities, so I will probably have to buy the 16-35 f/2.8L in order to cover the wide angles I need for some indoor photography at weddings and for photographing music acts in small clubs.That's really a minor complaint that's easily remedied, though, so I very confidently give the 30D my full recommendation for photographers of all levels and abilities.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Incredible DSLR Camera", "Author": "R.M.

Coming from a wimpy Sony Cybershot (where battery life was 70 minutes with a lithium-ion), I'm blown away. I've taken hundreds of pictures, looked at all of them on the LCD monitor, and the battery still barely takes a hit. Canon includes a lithium ion battery along with a charger, which also blew me away (considering I had to special order $150 worth of parts from Sony for a battery, charging pack and cable).NOTE: I'd recommend buying the BODY ONLY and put the extra $150+ towards a better lense.

I had always wanted a Nikon. The D200 is definitely a joy to hold and it did take good pictures (I tried both at a camera store before I bought the 30D). I did a lot of research (more than I care to admit!) and there was no conclusive evidence that one camera had a clear edge over the other. Depending on your specific needs, one camera may be \"slightly better\" than the other.After trying out both cameras, I was convinced the 30D was as good a fit for my needs as the D200. For \"value for money\" the 30D was a clear winner over the D200 (I got mine when Canon had the Cash in with Canon promotion going). Also, as a beginner to SLR I found the 30D with its fully automatic and scene modes easy to start out with. I don't expect to use the scene modes or the full auto mode after a week or two. I expect to quickly graduate to the creative control zones. But to use as a family camera, the quick scene modes are very helpful. If you expect to use it more on a professional basis it'd probably not matter.Additionally, when I checked it out at the store, I noticed the Canon 30D focused sharply almost every time. The D200 did not at least a few times. I'd take this with a grain of salt though since it was a brief trial at a store. But I thought I'd share my experience. It may have just been an anomaly with the actual equipment I tried out.Do I still find the Nikon D200 to be a great camera? Absolutely! Do I regret having bought a Canon 30D? Absolutely not! The decision swinger in my case was really the \"money factor\". I was more than willing to spend up to $300 more for the Nikon D200. But when the difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable for my Christmas gift to myself:-)My purchases included the Canon 30D [...], Canon 17-85mm EF-S IS USM lens [...], and a SanDisk Extreme III 2GB compact flash card [...]I plan to add an external flash to this soon, and will consider eventual lenses after I determine that the camera is a long-term keeper.", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Amazing Quality", "Author": "RichiePhotos.com", "ReviewID": "RR1WGUSBO1EYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the Digital Rebel XT and was decided to step up to the EOS 30D.

The larger screen and the \"film type\" options are the main differences between this and the 20D and for my money well worth it.  You get beautiful black and white results that have much more dimension than usual with a digital camera.  I've been shooting with it for a month or so now and really love everything about the camera.  I purchased it as a second body and an upgrade to my Rebel XT.  I couldn't quite justify the money for the 20D, but with the added \"film style\" options on the 30D I felt I was getting another dimension that would justify the second body.  Now I can carry them both hiking with the dog, have a short lens on one and a long on the other and not have to risk my sensor with in field lens changes.  Aside from the black and white being much better than any other I've seen with a digital camera the \"landscape film\" setting, not the fully automatic picture setting, but the film one really makes the greens in your landscapes pop.  The \"standard\" setting gives you beautiful, accurate colour and great skin tones. I haven't had a chance to play with the other two settings much.  The camera is blindingly fast, I have to be careful to not fire off five or six shots the thing is so fast.  The alternate 3 fps setting is a nice option to have if you have a slower lens and want to give it time to focus in a sports type situation.  The only draw back I had was the size and weight of the 30D compared to my Rebel.  I however, am one of the few people I know or have read about that felt the Rebel was the perfect size for my hands. Most people felt they had to add a battery grip onto the Rebel to have enough space to hold on to it.  The 30D is much bigger and heavier and that takes some adjusting to, but I have been able to shoot great hand held stuff after just a little bit of aclimization.  The battery life is also exceptional.  I am still shooting on the original charge of the battery after a month of use. Going back to the black and white, you can also add \"filters\" to the monochrome settings that save you the cost of getting a red, yellow, orange or green filter to further bring out depth in different situation.  I just love this camera.  I would rather take the picture I want in camera than go home and play with an exposure that isn't what I had in mind with software and I really feel that I can with this camera.

I am a serious amature. I enjoy nature pictures, gardens, flowers, mountains and my children and grandchildren. It does all of these very nicely. I have paired the camera up with the EFS 17-85 IS lens and find they work well for me. The canon sensor is excellent. I range up to ISO 1600 occasionally and often use 1000 for indoor flower shows and in museums. It gives excellent results and sometimes I further improve the pictures by using Noise Ninja. I have tried all of the picture settings but really like 'Standart Setting' the best as it just looks the most real to me. You do have a lot of choices though if you like to experiment. The camera/lens combination has a solid feel. I am definitely hands on and appreciate the 4 different light metering systems. I use the average metering the most with spot metering second and I do use the others at appropriate times. For my landscape and flower shows I believe I generally get within 1/3 stop of what I consider the 'correct' exposure. Photoshop does the rest but there isn't generally much to do. White balance works well. In the mixed indoor light of flower shows AWB gets pretty close and a little adjustment out of curves or levels tweeks it to my satisfaction. About the Canon IS lens. I got it because with age I was having difficulty getting a really steady shot at slow shutter speeds which I need to use indoors where I don't want to use flash. I have had very good results down to 1/10 second hand held and that in combination with a ISO of 1000 does a great indoor job and grain is not a problem.The camera came with a dirty sensor. It had a lot of dust bunnies that showed up in the skies. After getting tired of clonning them out I got the Copper Hill Sensor Cleaning Kit and in one afternoon I cleaned the sensor 3 times and I have the cleanest skies around now. It is regrettable that Canon delivers the camera with a dirty sensor but it is a solvable problem the $30 Copper Hill Kit is needed just like a lens cleaning kit so get one.I have other Canon lenses which also work fine on the camera.

Great for parents with active kids.", "Author": "Janis Fok", "ReviewID": "RCKH5YCVH3KD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera cannot keep up with him.  And I also don't like the washout look when I uses flash.  So I researched about which SLR will best meet my needs, mainly catching fast action, candid moments and low light photos without flash.  The Canon 30D comes up top on the list.  It has the best high ISO performance in its class (better than Nikon and Sony).  And when I combine the 30D with the fast zoom lens EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS, the result is amazing.  I can stop any action in daylight, capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode, and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod.  Portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background (bokeh).  Even the dimly-lit decors of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion came out superb when we went there for the Halloween party at night, without flash or tripod.  This is really an important factor for me to buy this camera, as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old.  But you will need a good lens to make this work well.  If you use a cheap kit lens, then it will probably not matter which camera you pick.  Remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens (not the kit lens)and crop the pictures to magnify the details.  The Sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and don't need low light performance (use flash and save money).  The Nikon has more custom function than Canon, and it is really as good as Canon.  They both have their strength and weakness.  Canon just happens to have slightly better high ISO performance and that suits my need better than Nikon.  To be fair, I should mention that the Nikon D200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year, beating the Canon 30D overall.  But the D200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me, better suits someone more serious about photography.  The D80 is like a \"mini\" D200, but slower.  So it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend.  Shooting in low light without flash will need good high ISO performance, a good fast lens (with wide aperture, usually expensive), and image stabilization.  If that's what you want, the Canon 30D with the EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS will not disappoint you.", "Date": "November 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best bet for family sports enthusiasts!", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R11CHBHBI4PQNR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 30D is more than a simple upgrade to the stellar 20D camera, it's now a workhorse.

As soon as the XTi was announced, I decided I would upgrade to that new camera. I owned the BG-E3 grip (which is made for the XT and XTi) and four batteries, plus I had a year of experience with the XT, so I felt the XTi was the best upgrade path. The XTi also offered 10mp and sensor cleaning. It had the nine-point AF system and the 2.5\" LCD.But this is a review for the 30D, right? Right. Although the XTi is the direct upgrade for the XT, I did wish for something a bit bigger in my hands. Also, I was looking for something with a bit more of a robust build. I'm not hard on my gear, but it's nice to know that it can take it if need be. The XTi didn't, to me, offer that. And despite only having the opportunity to hold the 30D at Best Buy with the \"don't steal me stick\" hanging beneath it, I really liked the feel. It doesn't have the 10mp or the sensor cleaning of the XTi.Wait! This IS a 30D review - right? Right!If you've shot with the XT, then the rest will mean something to you. The 30D is far more robust and sturdy. It feels like the SLR's of old - the AE-1 or A-1 I used to have. The XT feels somewhat more like a SLR point and shoot. The 30D is bigger - a bunch bigger. I don't need the grip on the 30D like I did on the XT to make it feel like an SLR.The 30D has some functional advantages to go along with the tactile ones: higher ISO settings for low light shooting; a higher top shutter speed for bright settings or freezing REALLY fast action; spot metering for those light-challenging shots; faster continuous shooting for catching the perfect expression or just the right angle on moving subjects; a MUCH better battery for almost double the shots between charges and a top LCD for shot settings.Heck, I even like the shutter sound more!I'm not putting down the XTi - it's a great camera! If the MP's matter to you or you like the sensor cleaning, those are things the 30D doesn't offer. The size might appeal to you if you want a smaller body. It's lighter, too. These are advantages.The 30D is the bridge between the pro systems and the pro-sumer systems. It offers much of the best of both worlds.

I agree with everything that was said concerning those features.  I'm also happy that there are those that think this camera is the best thing ever.  Where my disappointment takes place in the photos themselves.  I'm not a newcomer to photography (I started in 1955), nor am I new to digital.  I have the Fuji S7000 (6.3MP) and the pictures it produces are fantastic.  I assumed if I were to upgrade to 8MP or 9MP things would be even better.  I spent the better part of three weeks researching and reading everything I could get my hands on.  Everything I read about the 30D was overwhelming, so I purchased one. I would like to say that in the past seven weeks I've shot 3700 photos and barely half of them are equal to my S7000.  That's not to say I haven't produced some very creditable shots.  I have.  It's just that I expect the majority of them to be that way.  If I were to have shot the giraffe, that a customer attached, with my S7000 you'd be able to see every hair.  The birds shots would have been more distinct.  You'd not only see the individual feathers but the patterns in the feathers as well.  When I spend $1400 on a camera I expect it to produce unequaled photos.  I'll continue to use it, but for those photos that are must have's I will more than likely use my Fuji S7000.I still have all my 35mm SLR's and both of my twin-reflex type cameras.  I'm finding it hard to give them up.  I got my first digital camera five years ago.  It was only 1MP and I grew tired of the shots it produced.  So I kept upgrading.  It's been a good trip.  I'm not sorry I bought the Canon 30D because I can change lenses, which I cannot do with my Fuji.  But I'm not thrilled...yet.Since I wrote my review some time ago my 30D began acting up.  It would only take time exposure shots. No matter what setting I chose to put the camera in it would only take a time exposure.  Needless to say the shots I attempted were a disaster.  I tried everything imaginable and nothing worked.  As a last result I contacted Canon Service Representative and we went over a dozen different scenarios with no result.  Finally, I was directed to send it directly to Canon with a letter explaining the problem. In less than a week I had the camera back and it appears to be working fine.  I have to commend Canon for their fast and thorough corrections to the problem at no charge to me because it was still under warranty.Also, I've noted since my first review of this camera that if I put the camera on a tripod the shots come out a little better; however, I don't have to do the same with my other cameras.  I still don't feel like I should have to do it with this camera...but I'll live with it for now.I gave the camera 4 stars, because a distinct photo means a great deal to me.

J McCartin", "ReviewID": "R34WCQA6S32H2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those not familiar with the canon line the 10D came first, then the 20D, then the Rebel (aka 300D)then there were the really high end bodies with astronomical price tags that I won't mention.  Later came the revamped rebel the 350D and the Xti and the revamped 20D known as the 30D.  Each body has slightly different specs and megapixels, the Xti has the new 10 megapixel sensor but for me anyhow it just doesn't have the features I need.  My primary purpose for my cameras is shooting karate tests for my school, I shoot in a gymnasium with mixed lighting (and not much light either, this camera can shoot in the equivalent of ISO 3200 with very acceptable results, especially if used with a product such as noise ninja to correct noise issues) and have had to learn to get around mixed lighting issues but primarily I need the 5 fps offered by the 20D/30D and the more expensive canon bodies that I sure can't afford on my salary.  The Rebels and the 20D/30D have a \"C\" sized sensor which means that any 35mm lens you put on this body has a magnification factor of 1.6 so a 10 mm lens works a lot closer to 20 mm than ten mm etc. The C sized sensor also means that Canon and other lens manufacturers can take some design liberties with the back of the lens (of course this also means these special lenses won't work on a standard body just on a c sensor body).  The 20D is a very capable camera for anyone that wants to shoot fast sports or weddings etc.  The 30D has a lot of little tweaks that make an already excellent product even more capable.  The 20D has been discontinued as far as I know but you can still find them new on ebay etc., given a choice go for the 30D, they've revamped the shutter mechanism, revamped at least one of the focusing modes, the lcd is bigger and brighter, and to me anyhow, it just feels a lot spunkier when I shoot with it (and the 20D was already incredibly spunky).  I haven't had a chance to shoot my usual subject with it yet but just from a few snaps her and there it seems to expose a little darker at least outdoors in the shade.  I was going to wait for the 40D but I got a chance at a floor model 30D for an unbelievable price and so I grabbed it knowing the new 40D would not be as cheap in the forseeable future.  The big difference with the 40D will be the new 10 megapixel sensor.  I really enjoy my camera, I think the canon glass is generally overpriced especially for the professional L series lenses. Take a look at the Sigma EX or EX DG line before deciding on canon glass, they're generally just as fast as the canon lenses at focusing and one heckuva lot cheaper.Recommended lenses: For a walk around lens the canon 28-135 IS is a great lens.  For shooting stuff that can be close or medium far look at the 17-85 IS and the sigma 10-20 EX DG (good landscape lens too).  The IS system is great because it will correct camera shake to a point and allows you to handhold at shutter speeds not normally possible.  The kit lens 17-55 is ok but there are much better choices, avoid it if you can.Flash units: The canon 580EX is a great flash but also check out the metz af-58 1C for professional class units, the built in flash is not really suited for anything but snaps if you ask me.Other stuff you want: IS lenses suck batteries like candy.  You want the BG-E2 or one of the generic equivalent battery grips (ebay).  It makes the camera a lot more stable, easier to hold and repeats some common controls when shooting vertically.Several extra batteries:  I like the Lenmar rapid charger (comes with a 12V car cord too) for these batteries and buy a few extra off ebay (check the seller rep and be sure they are 7.4 volt packs not 7.2 volt packs--full price these batteries are ridiculous but you can get them reasonable on ebay from third party manufacturers)Several large fast compact flash cards:  Full sized images take a lot of space, this camera has large buffers so you almost never have an issue but buy the 80-150X high speed cards, you'll be glad you did (warranty generally better on them also). I've used Lexar and ridata and sandisk extreme with no issues in this camera, buy a few medium sized 2G-4G ones not one huge one (card errors can wipe the whole card but that's rare).Nice bag: The 20D/30D are somewhat weatherized but it's still not something you want to get wet. Hlliburton makes some very nice metal cases with foam inserts to protect your expensive gear. You might also want a special cover for shooting in inclement weather that lets you control the camera and keeps the water off it.Digital wallet? If you shoot a lot and are away a long time a digital wallet with a notebook hard drive installed will let you clean off your cards and reuse them while storing your images on the internal hard drive.  These can be found on ebay pre assembled or in kits just add your own hard drive and away you go.Lots of hard drive space or a product like Roxio and a DVD burner: You need to store your hard won images securely.  I have mine on three hard drives for redundancy you could also use a RAID setup or back up to DVD (but the size of DVDs you need a lot of those to backup lots of images) at least until such time as most normal people can afford the new blue ray and media backing up to single layer DVD will take a while.  Dual layer DVD holds twice as much but the media is a lot more expensive.  When you choose a software make sure it's one that will chain the backup for you automatically, it's a big hassle to figure out what will fit on a DVD manually.", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "IMO, STILL the best buy for the money!", "Author": "JanSobieski", "ReviewID": "R3ISM32EQHWXI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera offers a few well considered improvements over the 20D it replaces. The sensor and processor are the same so the image quality will not differ one iota, BUT an enlarged LCD monitor, spot metering, vastly improved shutter life and ISO displayed on the viewfinder are worthy improvements easily justifying the upgrade from the 20D. If one is considering an upgrade from the 10D my advice would be to definitely go for it. The 20D and 30D both have the \"instant on\" feature and this represents a vast improvement over the 10D. The 10D was felt by many to have focusing issues and though I did not have any significant problem with my 10D in that regard the 30D represents a substantial improvement in this area. Canon still is not offering (in this price range) a camera with eye control or 45 focusing points, BUT the nine focusing points that ARE offered are well placed and the camera focuses quickly and surely resulting in tack sharp photos.The pictures this camera takes are simply beyond belief. Beautifully saturated, tack sharp, NO, and I mean NO noise at 400 or below and barely discernible noise all the way up to 1600 ISO. For all practical purposes 1600 ISO is an entirely usable speed resulting in fantastic pictures. What Canon has accomplished in reducing noise and increasing pixel density proves that they are, for now, the technology leader. Canon for now is doing a better job at controlling noise than Nikon though Nikon with the D200 comes pretty darn close except at 800 ISO and above.The new flash system, ETTL II, available first on the 20D is a vast improvement over previous systems. The in camera processing results in exceptional and pleasing pictures. This camera has a fixed continuous shooting rate which was not present on the 20D. The megapixels stay constant at 8.2 million pixels. Many may be disappointed that the MP count was not increased and feel that perhaps a nominal increase to 10MP would have better justified an upgrade. Canon obviously feels that noise and other features are more important at this point than raw MP's and I would agree. The holy grail of digital photography is now dynamic range. And while this camera offers no improvement in dynamic range I think we can expect to see such improvements in future offerings from Canon and the other manufacturers.One of the greatest things about digital photography is the ability to build a digital dark room for next to nothing. With the included Photoshop Elements you are well on your way to producing pictures that you could only have imagined in the pre-digital days. I am able to recoup pictures that I never would have considered salvageable before this camera. And while Elements is a great program and more than adequate for most needs I would recommend considering Photoshop CS2 for those who intend to plumb the depths of this hobby.Another thing I like about Canon is the lens system which IMO is second to none. Also, Canon continues to innovate at a furious pace driving the price of these digital cameras relentlessly downward. This camera is being introduced at a lower price than either the 10D or the 20D. The 5D is plummeting in price and is approaching my \"strike point\" for purchase. I expect that we will see a sub $2000 10 MP camera with a full frame sensor in the next 18 months. Such are the economics of digital photography. It would seem that Moore's law is driving the prices down inexorably.So, I LOVE the 30D! LOVE Canon. And LOVE digital.

The images are stunning and far exceed the results I used to get with film, even fine grain Kodachrome. The camera's controls are easy to learn and get to when necessary. What shocked me most were results from the highest ISO speed. Using slower lenses, even with Image Stabilization, you would expect unsharp results due to camera movement. Thanks to IS and the D30's incredible sensor, you can \"push process\" your digital up to 3200 ISO. In film terms, that would the equivalent of pushing 400 ASA Tri-X three stops.

But, like many camera shoppers, I did some homework before buying, and settled on this 30D kit with the 17-85mm lens.With the rebate ($230 on this package as of 12/06), this is a good, full-featured deal.  This package will suit many people's needs, and includes a good \"walk-around\" lens that is generally regarded as better than the standard kit 18-55.The 30D is no doubt on its way out, to be replaced by something fancier -- hence the rebate. But it has all the important features -- enough megapixels for great pictures at reasonable enlargements, versatile shooting modes & shutter settings (up to 5 frames per second), good LCD, very good low-light performance, the capability of different metering arrangements including spot metering, intelligent image processing, sturdy metal construction, etc.True, you can get even a Canon Rebel with more than 8 megapixels. One thing I learned from a lot of experts' websites, though, is that having more megapixels than this is of no real value, unless for some reason you are doing large poster-size images that need to withstand scrutiny up close (which is not a normal viewing distance for a big poster).  So for me, the 30D's features & construction outweighed the Rebel XTi's 10MP and lower price.  I wanted the metal body, the ability to shoot sports at 5 frames per second, and spot metering, all of which are lacking in the Rebel.The image stabilization (\"IS\") feature on this lens really does help.  Just playing around while shooting handheld, I was able to get good images on some shockingly slow shutter speeds on the 30D, albeit not every exposure. But the \"IS\" feature will stretch your ability to work handheld at slow shutter speeds, especially at a long focal length.  Try it -- take a few pictures even at a half-second, and you might be surprised at some of them.This lens itself is not particularly \"fast.\" Staying on a budget, I combined this kit with Canon's 50mm 1.8 lens (under $70) to enhance low-light shooting options, including indoor family shots and portraits.  The bag I chose was a Lowepro Slinghot 200, which I'm tentatively happy with. My new memory card is a Sandisk Extreme III 1GB, and I'll also get a bigger one later when prices come down (make sure to get a card \"fast\" enough that it won't slow the camera down when shooting in bursts).With a UV filter to fit each lens, it has been \"off to the races\" with this kit. Still on the shopping list are a separate flash (although I don't see the shadow problem with the built-in flash mentioned by another reviewer), a second battery and a tripod.Remember, this camera and similar ones have a 1.6 \"conversion factor,\" meaning you multiply the focal length of the lens by 1.6 to get the lens's \"equivalent\" focal length performance. So they make a lens more \"telephoto\" than it would otherwise be.There are other Nikon or Canon setups that will take good care of you, but I found this body/lens combo to be a pretty cost-effective way to start building a system.

The significantly larger LCD makes reviewing shots actually possible on the LCD, and the bigger LCD means bigger text -- better for us farsighted guys.  I do wildlife pictures and portraits where it's great to motor-drive 20 or 30 shots at a go, and the 30D supports that.  And I grew up with hand-held spot metering, so its return in the 30D is wonderful.However, if you ARE thinking of upgrading from a 350D, be aware of a few things.  First, you've got to re-buy your wired and wireless remote controls at outrageous prices.  All of the power stuff, including the AC adapter, your batteries, any battery chargers and the 350D's battery handle will require new purchases.One more thing that is a bit annoying: despite the fact that Microsoft has announced that 32 bit's on the way out, the four included photo applications run badly or not at all on my copy of XP x64 edition.  There are workarounds, of course, but it's blasted annoying.Whether you stay with a current camera or upgrade, I wish you the best of luck with your digital photography.

They're both great cameras. The deciding factor for me was the ergonomics. The XTi is just too small. The grip is so small that my hand started cramping up within minutes of handling it. The 30D is solid. It feels great in your hands. And holy crap is it fast. You can shoot 5fps and the cache clears in a fraction of the time it takes the Rebel.The Rebel really only has two advantages over the 30D. 10 megapixels, versus 8, and dust management. But for large prints, you really don't need much more than 6MP. The megapixel race is all hype. And photographers have been getting by for more than 100 years just being careful to keep their equipment free of dust. Dust filters are nice, but not completely necessary.After using the 30D for a month, I'm very happy with my decision. And, by the way, if you're going to buy the kit, get the 28-135mm f/4-5.6 IS USM kit.

For people who have only used point-and-shoot cameras, this camera may at first seem a bit large, but trust me, you will immediately find this to be an advantage in terms of the stability you gain by having more surface area to hold. It feels like a glove. Once you get used to it, holding your point-and-shoot will feel quite awkward. The camera encompasses such a broad range of creative control that the absolute novice can take it right out of the box and start photographing in 5 minutes (don't forget to buy a compact flash card since one is not provided by Canon). The possibilities of creative potential offered by this camera are only limited by your skill and creativity as a photographer/Photoshop user.

As much as I love the 1 series, there are times when I want to use a smaller body. Years ago I had the 10D and loved the feel of the camera and quiet shutter but hated the slow start-up and image review. I upgraded to the 20D but returned it because of the awful sounding shutter and small LCD. Still wanting a small body to compliment my big and heavy 1D bodies, I was very happy when Canon released the 30D. It has a quieter shutter, a larger 2.5 inch lcd for viewing your histogram after a shot, and spot metering. It feels a little better in your hand as well, though not quite as solid as the 10D did. I had my first 30D converted to shoot IR (infrared) earlier this year and recently picked up another 30D due to the bargain prices now. A lot of people dumped their 30D bodies when the 40D came out but I am not all that impressed w/ the 40D (3 inch lcd has poor resolution, dust cleaning is a gimic) and didn't see paying another $400 for the additional 2 megapixels as being worth it.

I have had the camera for about four months, and i have next to no complaints. here are some pros and cons of the Canon 30d:Prosa) You get superior build quality. You get a body made of Magnesium Alloy, instead of plastic like the lower-quality entry level Nikon and Canon Digital SLR's. It does not feel ' cheap ' which is pretty reassuring. The weather-sealed body is definitely important.b) You get a top status LCD screen. Most entry-level cameras don't come with Status LCD screens, this is usually something seen solely on Mid-range cameras. It is really handy when it's very bright outside. You see all of the relevant information.c) Great performance at high ISO's. This camera performs exceptionally at all levels of sensitivity, from ISO one hundred to thirty two hundred. At 3,200, the images are relatively noise-free, which was a surprise to me. Try cranking up the ISO to 3,200 on the D40, You will surely not be happy with the results.d) Fast Shooter. The 30d shoots at a fast five frames per second, which is considerably rare for a camera in this price range. The D40 shoots twice as slow. Even the Nikon D90 and The Canon 5d Mark II shoot slower than the 30d, surprising right? The burst speed is really convenient sometimes. With a fast sports lens, this would be the perfect camera for the soccer-mom.Those are the basic Pros.Consa) The only Con i can think of is that it does not have a self-cleaning sensor. Here in the Bahamas it is hard to obtain the supplies needed to clean a sensor, so it would have been good for Canon to have incorporated a self-cleaning sensor into the body. If you have sensor-cleaning supplies, this won't be a problem. Cleaning the sensor can be quite an endeavor for some.This is a really good camera, i would seriously suggest it. You don't have to pay for more expensive cameras when you will get better performance with the Canon 30d.

I just like the process of developing film, printing photos and looking at a black and white pictures printed on fiber-based photographic paper.  I initially resisted digital photography as a poor imitation of \"real\" photography.  While using the EOS 30D has not totally changed that belief, it has made me realize that photography encompasses more than my own narrow viewpoints.I've been using Canon EOS film cameras and Canon EF lenses (among numerous other 35mm and medium format cameras and lenses) for about nine years.  In that time, Canon equipment has proven to be reliable, precise and well made.  When I decided to buy a digital camera, I knew it would be a Canon DSLR.  Surprisingly, it was simple for me to learn the basics of digital photography despite my lack of computer savvy.  Not surprisingly, the 30D got little use in the first several months of ownership due to my innate distrust of new equipment.  After a bit of doodling around with the camera, I learned to trust it and I'm using it more and more.If you've used an EOS SLR in the past, you will find the 30D to feel very familiar.  It's a comfortable camera to use despite it being rather small and my hands being pretty large.  Like all Canon models above the Rebel level, control buttons and wheels are all in natural positions and easily manipulated.  The viewfinder is smaller than Canon 35mm and full frame digital SLRs and it has taken some getting used to.  Initial trepidation with using CF cards instead of film has proven to be without basis.  After experimenting with the camera's built-in software, I am getting nice, sharp, saturated color photos and some very impressive monochromes.  Using a dedicated photo printer, I am impressed with inkjets that simply look stunning.Will I give up film for digital?  Certainly not--at least for my black and white work.  I still prefer a fiber and silver-based black and white photograhic print over an inkjet and I don't intend to shut down my darkroom or give up my film cameras.

The quality of the kit lens doesn't match the quality of the camera body, therefore your picture quality will suffer, so what's the point of buying a camera like the 30D and not buying a lens to match? When I was choosing my camera, looking at pictures taken with various cameras helped, so if you like you can view my photography at flickr.com/photos/gira I always note the lens I used so that can give you an idea also what you'd be interested in there.", "Date": "November 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "AWESOME DIGITAL SLR", "Author": "tavegas \"tavegas\"", "ReviewID": "RZN9T0NZP65GF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fine unit for the price.

I added a battery grip to help balance the weight of the heavy, long \"l\" lenes and it is a must! the 24-70 is great , as is the 1.2 50mm but it is like 80mm due to crop factor. if you need a close to 50mm get a 35mm. battery life is super long. I added a 580 II flash and a bracket to get it over lens at more height and it is also a great item. the 40d looks interesting as it has a sensor clearer, I have had to clean it a few times, no big deal but check it before important shoot.

I think 8.2 megapixels is just fine for me and I have had no problem thus far with image quality even when cropped.All in all I would say go for it!

The 50mm f1.4, the 70-300mm IS lens and the Canon 28-135MM IS lens. All of these lens deliver excellent pictures in low light, provide sharp images and focus quickly and accurately. I tend to be a strong believer in Nikon and Canon because of the bench strength of their great lens.The only downside of the 30D is it lacks live view. In my opinion this is of limited if any value.

Higher-end SLR (single lens reflex) digital cameras are now getting more affordable and user friendly...they're not just for professionals anymore. This month I will review the technology behind the digital SLR and specifically the performance of the Canon EOS 30D, about $1,300 with standard zoom lens.What is it? SLRs or single lens reflex digital cameras are becoming even more popular as their costs decrease. Once a replacement for film cameras for professional photographers, many digital SLRs can be purchased from about $500 and up. Some popular makes are: Nikon, Olympus, Canon, Pentax, Sony and even Kodak. According to market researcher NPD Group Inc, a digital SLR has an average holiday price of about $942. Baby boomers, brought up with film SLRs are flocking to the digital mode as they can afford the newer cameras and appreciate the difference in quality and performance.Digital SLRs create better photos for a number of reasons, including the larger size of the sensor (collects more light, faster and more accurate - especially in low light situations) and are much better in taking action shots. The superior optical quality of the larger lenses is also a major factor in getting crystal clear photos.The Canon EOS-30D, has 8-megapixel resolution and a 2.5 inch LCD, and it shoots continuously at 5 frames per second with a 30-shot buffer, so you don't miss the action shots of your kids, sports or wildlife. It's not too bulky or heavy and has good hand feel and balance. It provides good high-sensitivity photos which are crisp and not grainy and has image stabilization which reduces blur when using extended zoom.How it works: Folks with compact digital cameras know the frustration of shutter lag and the inability to frame your pictures accurately through the small LCD screen. Typically compact digital cameras take the photo a fraction of a second or so after you snap, often missing the action you wanted to capture. It's also hard to frame and focus with the smaller cameras smaller LCDs. With SLRs, you view the action directly through a viewfinder and actually look through the lens via a mirror that moves up when you press the shutter button. You get what you see. The viewfinder is also a blessing when you are in a bright light situation where the image on an LCD is hard to see due to glare.Other benefits to the advanced amateur include: saving film costs and not dealing with chemicals if you used to develop or print your own photos. If you choose to do your own printing and editing, there are many good programs that allow you to do some impressive work right on your Windows or Mac computer.In the past you would have to take and develop a whole role of film to see if you got the right shot. With digital photography, you can just take as many photos as you'd like and delete all except the \"keepers.\" You won't have to pay for, or keep a large inventory of poor photos as you only keep and print the good ones. Unlike film, digital CF memory doesn't go out of date, and can hold hundreds of photos before you have to download them to your computer.What you need: Besides buying the camera kit, which should include the standard 18mm-55mm zoom lens, buy extra CF memory card. Most cameras don't come with a memory card. Additional accessories may include a heavier duty flash and/or a better quality lens. You will probably need a Mac or Windows XP computer with a USB slot for downloading the photos from the camera. The Canon comes with software for both Windows and MAC that is quite good and easy to use. While I have used the Canon software, I prefer to use iPhoto on the Mac.How to get it: Be careful about buying on-line. I saw a great deal on the Canon and bought it. I then had to call a number for delivery options and they told me I had to buy the battery charger for an extra cost (which would have brought the total price up to what everyone else was selling it for). I declined and asked them to send me exactly what was on the product description on their website. After much going back and forth, they told me they couldn't fulfill the order - they were out of the ones without the battery charger! I \"Googled\" the online company and found quite a list of disgruntled buyers - apparently they pull this routine all the time. Lesson learned - check out the on-line company before you spend any time with them. I immediately cancelled my order with them and bought the camera locally with no problem. You can watch for sales and rebates at consumer electronics stores for good deals or check with camera stores. Sometimes the camera is sold \"body only\" and you need to purchase the lens separately. This is good if you want to purchase a specific, upgraded lens of your choice.How hard is it to use? The automatic mode is very simple. You can learn to use in 10 minutes or less. The manual settings require a bit of reading and playing, but you can get some awesome results. The combination of digital photography and photo editing software are a great match.Findings: Not surprisingly, I love it. I have been an amateur photographer from my college days and grew up using Nikon and Nikomat 35 mm film SLRs. While they are heavy and clumsy by today's standards, they took great photos, mostly because of the control you had over shutter speed and f-stop as well as the great Nikor lenses. I find you can get the same control (if you choose) from the Canon EOS-30D along with a wide variety of Canon and other lenses. While the Canon EOS-30D is about the same size as the older film SLRs, it is much lighter. This camera has made me retire my film cameras.Pros: Convenience; not having to buy and store film, lighter camera, getting what you see, ease of use, professional results. The Canon EOS-30D also came highly recommended by my professional photographer friends. While I have been partial to Nikon, the earlier digital SLR models seemed to have had some mechanical defects, which took time to repair. However, I have not heard of any major shortcomings with the major SLR manufacturers' new models.Cons: Cost. They are more expensive than compact or viewfinder cameras. They are heavier and bulkier than compact cameras. You'll want accessories such as: additional or better quality lenses, heavy-duty flash, gadget bags, tripods and a host of other attachments. It's too big to keep in your pocket or purse to use for snap shots. I have also found the built-in flash to be weak - only good to about 10 feet. Good enough for snap shots. An upgraded professional quality Canon flash is about a $400 accessory.Bottom-line: In general, I am very happy with the feel, performance and results from the Canon EOS-30D and would recommend it to any serious amateur photographer.For more information: See the January 2007, Consumers Reports or Google for more information and user's comments.

Great price, great delivery; I had not taken into consideration that the tripod would be as heavy and bulky as it is (not a con though), which added to the delivery price, but that's my fault.What made me take the plunge was a combination of the lower price once the 40D was out; research which led me to better appreciate the value of a good lens first, a good camera second; and the fact that the Canon Rebel line never felt right in my (6 feet tall) hands.First impressions? Swoon... It had been a long time since I had been wowed by anything electronic - computers lower one's expectations by that much, I guess. What I appreciate and will be obvious to any pro:- It feels like a well made quality product; great ergonomics, if a tad heavy;- It takes the picture \"right now\" with the manual modes, which is a major reason why you would buy this instead of a \"point and (eventually) shoot\";- You can unleash your creativity by fiddling with the dozens of parameters; I just read Ken Rockwell's excellent online tutorial and feel like I've been liberated: I'm getting the type of pictures I want after only a couple of days of playing with it.My main concern was getting blurry pictures because of my somewhat shaky hands; the combination of a fast lens and tinkering with shutter speeds and exposure has saved the day.Does the 40D do more things?

Compared to the Rebel line, the camera is bigger and sturdier.  The camera fits in my hands much better, and the magnesium body feels like it will last much longer than the plastic body of the Rebel.The shutter for this camera is also rated for 100,000 actuations compared to the 50,000 for the Rebel XT and 20D.  The LCD screen is much larger also.  I have not experienced any problems with dead pixels or coloration problems with the screen.  The viewfinder is bigger and easier to see through than the Rebel as well.One of my favorite features is the wheel in the back as opposed to the 4 buttons of the Rebel.  The wheel allows for quick changes to exposure compensation as well as much easier scrolling through the pictures when in the review setting.In a nutshell, if you are new to photography, are on a tighter budget and  want to see exactly how interested you really are in Digital SLR's, I always recommend the Rebel XT or XTi.  It is a great starter camera that wont break the bank.  However, if you know you want a great camera or already have a Rebel, the 30D is a very nice upgrade.

Since I already owned several cameras and lenses of Canon, Nikon and Mamiya, I knew I would choose a DSLR camera body between a Canon and Nikon model so that I could use my old but great lenses. I was leaning using my Nikkor lenses, so after some research, I decided to buy Nikon D80--its large and bright view finder was a major attraction to me for I do like to take photos through the view finder rather than a live screen.But before I ordered it, I went to the stores to have a look at the camera.  My impression of the Nikon D80 body was not good.  It looked small and a bit cheap feeling.  I just didn't like the design and the feeling of it while holding it.  And it's not made in Japan.  The Canon models are.  Somehow I more trust in cameras that are made in Japan. But Canon Rebels are too small and light.  Even though I have rather small hands, I still like a more solid and a bit more weighty camera body.  The newly launched Canon 40D looked nice, but I wasn't inclined to buy a camera that's just come to the market.  So, leaving the stores it seemed I still didn't have a camera to buy.  After I did a bit more research, I found Canon 30D was right for me, so without actually seeing the actual camera, which was not available at the stores, I ordered it believing a predecessor of 40D must also be made in Japan.  And it is.  It looks and works great with its well designed features.Ever since I moved three years ago, I have lost the access to the great darkrooms of a college where I enrolled in a darkroom class for five years just to use the facilities--I had such an incredible time processing, printing and enlarging my own color and b&w; photographs that when the digital wave came I was rather skeptical and considered using computers and printers was rather mechanical and not romantic or artistic at all, but I guess that prejudice has left me now and with Canon 30D, I found my passion for photo making has come back to me, it's great fun to switch between color and b&w; using one camera, and it is no less fun to crop and alter contrast to instantly create impressive pictures.  One suggestion, for general color photography, avoid shooting in the sunlight, always using the open shadow or shooting in a cloudy day.  That way you don't need a hood, even with a hood, you won't get the best colors in the sun.  And I don't like to use filters either.  But I highly recommend Canon 30D, it's not the most \"professional\" camera, but an ultra expensive camera doesn't mean it will bring you great photos, which can only be got through good eyes and some impromptu moments, and of course, practice.

It's never let me down. I put a much faster 8Gig memory card in it and discovered it could take pictures at 5 per second for ever providing you don't mind waiting 20 seconds for it to catchup when you stop. And with 2000 shots on a memory card, who cares. Just be ready to wait a while when you go to download it. This camera can do ISO 3200 so you can take noisy pictures in complete dark, sometimes I don't care as long as I can get a picture, and this camera can do it. I've taken amazing shots all over the world with this camera, my only complaint is the weight and when I could afford another it will probably be the XSi since it weights half as much and has most of the useful options of the EOS 30D, but I'd never sell my 30d, I'll keep it till it dies. I've got a couple of the smaller pocket camera, the latest one being the Canon A650IS, a real let down, just takes way too long to get a picture and compared to the 30D it's a piece a cr*p. Although I paid twice as much for my 30D as they cost today, I still thing it's my best investment to date. If I could afford it I suppose I would have had a 5, but that's in a whole other ball park and it weighs even more. This camera replaced my Canon A1, up till I got it I didn't have a digital that could hold a candle to my A1, but with this one the A1 got shelved and has stayed there. The automatic settings are so good on this camera I rarely run it any other way. With adjustments to ISO and 1/3 stops you can make it do just about anything is 1/10th the time it would take you to setup manual. I am sure the 40D and the 50D have some interesting options the 30D doesn't but I've got my 30D and they will have to pry it out of my dead hands.", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "PJ Georgiou \"Papa Georgiou\"", "ReviewID": "R1TY8GH6ZQ7ARB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR and i can't say enough great things about it.  I won't get into the technical details, it's all right there at the Canon website.  The programs are user friedly and the menu is laid out very well.  I reccommend reading the manual and any other reading material that helps you get the most out of this camera.  Remember you paid a good chunk of change for it so you might as well understand how it operates.  If you are wondering whether or not the 8 mega pixels is enough for your needs, just ask yourself how big you plan on printing.  You can easily print beautiful 8X10 with this many mega pixels.  Just remember that the mega pixels doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the image until your start printing LARGER prints. In other words you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a 5 mega pixel and 15 megapixel on a 4X6 print.  Choose a great lens and then you will start noticing a difference.  I ended pairing this with a Sigma 10-20 and a Canon 24-105 L.  I hope to get the 70-200 IS f/4 and be done with it.  For a beginning photographer you cannot go wrong with this camera!  I highly reccommend it and have produced terrific images with it!UPDATE;I had to send off my Canon 30D to Jamesburg, NJ to clean dust off the sensor.  Most of the time you can blow it off with a bulb blower...  Canons customer service was excellent and very quick.  It was back in my hands dust free in less than a week.

In terms of picture quality, even though 20D and 30D both are 8 million pixel but still the image quality is much better by 30D, especially in weak lighting condition.The only thing I have noticed that 30D is not as good as 20D is the color of LCD of 30D is a little bit more yellow tone(the true picture is not), which is more precise on 20D.Considering its price and performance, I will gave it 5 stars since it has met all my needs at current stage.", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Product", "Author": "April Courville", "ReviewID": "R1YUF71VZ96AAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item was listed as used and was the lowest listed price.

I ended up using my Powershot A95 which does great job with ambient light and no flash in museums or staged performances.  Main advantage is being able to capture shots with rapid shutter response but it is heavier and bulkier than A95 which also gets excellent results.  Didn't notice charger included in kit so ordered extra battery and charger from outside source through Amazon and now it is more costly to return than to keep both.

I own the 30D and I am very pleased with it, however I also bought it a few weeks before the Rebel XTi was fully announced.  The Rebel XTi has more megapixels than the 30D (10 vs 8) and the XTi has a self dust cleaning system which the 30D does not have.  The only true reason to choose the 30D over the XTi is if you are a serious sports photographer and need 5 frames per second (30D) instead of 3 fps (XTi).  Another major distinction between the two bodies is the size.  The XTi is much smaller than the 30D.  Some love this, while others with large hands prefer the larger size of the 30D.  Since the XTi is about $[...] less than the 30D I would have to advise you to get the XTi.For your knowledge I own the Canon Rebel XT and the Canon 30D.", "Date": "October 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "One years worth of use...", "Author": "Lee Weinberg \"Robby Weinberg\"", "ReviewID": "RVCJYCVYGEY6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have now had this camera for one year.

High ISOs on this camera still look good, ISO3200 even!This is a SLR camera. That means that the lenses are interchangable.
