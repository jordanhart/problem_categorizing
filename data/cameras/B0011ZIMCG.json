I really like the selection of the colors and the camera itself is very easy to use.  One thing I didn't realize until purchasing this camera was the memory card needed for.  This camera has to have a XD card and it's not SD card that most camera uses.  If you own SD card already and not planning to purchase another kind, this camera might not be the right choice but even if buying a new card, price is still be very attractive.", "Date": "November 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "wonderful all-purpose affordable easy-to-use", "Author": "Prejzki", "ReviewID": "R3DI7K5FI80I70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this camera in red and it was recently stolen in a home burglary, so I am looking to replace it asap. I'm not even looking at other brands or models. I am amazed at how the price has dropped since my original purchase, especially if I choose a different color (red is oddly more expensive than the other colors). I took some grainy video when I first got the camera, but after tweaking the settings, it worked very well for me for both video and still-shots. It's easy to use, the menu system is intuitive, and the pics were turning out great for me. It's also compact enough to slip into my purse or pocket.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "cute camera; doesn't hold up", "Author": "say no to Olympus", "ReviewID": "R8SK8K1H0LTMM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a little over a year ago and liked it so much, I went back to the shop and bought another one for my daughter.  However it is now 13.5 months later and the camera, one month out of warranty, stopped working.  Specifically, the little button that turns on the power jammed and it will not turn on at all.  The local Olympus dealership wants more than the camera cost originally to fix it - he says it is a short in the on off switch.  The camera cost $225 last year and had a lot of nice features but the quality of the workmanship is so poor (despite being a Japanese camera, it is actually made in Vietnam) that I would not buy any other Olympus product after my experience.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Olympus FE-340 Digital Camera", "Author": "Richard Auslander", "ReviewID": "R8PDPL0EAP6XN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my wife.

Griffin", "ReviewID": "R3BIT4JPQ8MVLJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased two for Christmas.  One began to malfunction within the first 60 days.  When I attempted to zoom, the lens would pulsate in and out a few times and then the camera would power down.  It would often power down with the lens protruding from the camera.  I returned it to Olympus, but they refused to repair or replace.  Their assessment was the lens was impacted and impacts are not covered under warranty.  I advised that the malfunctioning lens would often not retract into the housing so it is possible that it may have scratches and that is why I was returning it.  From their perspective, it was out of the question that the malfunctioning lens could have occurred first.  I was BLOWN away.  60 days of use, out of $149 and one unhappy 15 year old, now without a digital camera.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "You get what you get and you don't throw a fit", "Author": "Robert Krenke \"Krenkekids\"", "ReviewID": "R9NK395Q7CTZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty simple camera to use.  In AUTO it is almost foolproof.  Note the XD card to make sure your computer can handle it.  Battery is rechargeable and the battery pack has a pretty good capacity.  It is pretty fragile so I would recommend a camera case.  In a purse with other media devices: phone, Black Berry, etc... it can get scratched up.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Its OK", "Author": "Keon B.

I find that the images are not always as sharp as they could be, and the colors are not always right depending on lighting.

It works pretty well, the pics are nice and the video comes out well too. The only thing I really disliked about it was that fact that it didn't take SD memory cards, so it's not compatible to view pics from other devices. The shutter speed isn't really that great either, I was hoping that buying a new camera would get me quicker shots, but it kind of fell short of my expectations there.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS CAMERA!  :o)", "Author": "N.

It is surprising to see 5x optical zoom in such a small package.  I got fast M+xD memory and can take unlimited 30fps VGA movies.  The camera is very nice to use in all functions.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the pictures don't look quite as good as on my other (more expensive) cameras.
