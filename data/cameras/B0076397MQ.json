It is handy.I still keep my K20d and use K-01 as a second camera mostly. But when in the mood, I put a couple of DA Limited lenses in my pocket and go for a walk with K-01 only.I wear glasses, and using optical viewfinder always was a bit clumsy for me. Also, I live in cold climate, and viefinder becomes covered with a hoar wery soon. So I don't miss the thing, pure LV without mirror lag is perfectly OK for me.Image quality is great. While I am a bit sceptical about bells&whistles;, I used in-camera HDR several times and it works well. Camera also has a rich media processing abilities, not only posh image filters but even a basic video editor (which I also used once).With new firmware focusing speed for Tamrons 18-200 and 70-300 improved and is compatible with Pentax DSLRs now.Autofocus, however, is not always accurate and may miss the target. This probably occurs when the background has more contrast. What is sad that it may happen even when contarst background object is out of AF frame. This happens not very often, but each miss is annoying.Also, the rate of continuous shooting is low, which limits wild life genre for ex.Back to advatages, focus peaking and zooming the focusing area are extremely useful. Manual focusing is really easy now. Frankly speaking, only with K-01 I was able to focus my FA77 at 1.8 at the desired point ALWAYS. With phase AF its only a caprice of SAFOX, but even with Katz-eye split screen in manual mode its difficult for me: I just cannot see enough details in optical VF. With zoomed focusing area it becomes an easy task.Resume: very good spare camera with a bit too slow continuous shooting. At this price -- no reasons to skip.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beats the K-5 for the casual shooter!", "Author": "honemasterT", "ReviewID": "R27T0CHQSMB2SK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My *only* complaint about this camera is the limitation of 1 FPS in RAW mode.Outside of that it's got a better focus system than the K-5 (not the current K-5IIs).It has a better video mode and is more portable when compared to a DSLR.Compared to the K-5, the anti-aliasing filter is weaker as well, which makes this a great candidate for astrophotography (works with the O-GPS1 attachement as well!?)Check out the Pentax forums for examples of what this camera can do, when pointed at the night sky.. amazing for just around $300![...]Check out the Dxomark Camera sensor ratings.. the K-5 is rated very highly.. this camera has the same sensorWith the recent firmware update, the K-01 focuses even faster. (as does my K-5) One other area this camera has over the K-5 (not sure about the K-5ii/s) is the focus tracking mode. I use this as a second camera to hand to another parent at kids sporting events, while I use the K-5 from a different angle/viewpoint. The fact that it works with every other lens in my camera bag is a huge plus and uses the same battery as the K-5.Positives: Focus peaking, better focus tracking mode, weaker anti-aliasing filter.Negatives: No viewfinder, No weathersealing, No High speed flash sync, 1fps in raw.(the latter seems like it could be fixed in firmware? c'mon Pentax help us out!? :)At less than $300 now (while they last) I may need to purchase another one!Go to dpreview and compare the iso3200 samples of the K-01 with the Nikon D4, D800 and Canon EOS 5D Mark IIShortened link..

Lets you take impressive portraits and low light photos.* With this lens, it takes nice videos even in low light. Doesn't focus though during videos, like most SLRs, but if you use Manual focus, you can focus during recording manually.* If you like to take landscapes, the HDR mode will help you take nice photos any time of the day.* The camera is filled with lot of functions and features like most modern SLRs.* With same K mount, in body Image Stabilization, and now Focus Peaking, you can use old Pentax lenses plus most of the m42 lense with a cheap $5-10 adapter.* Out of the box camera has slow Auto Focus but you can upgrade the firmware and it gets as good as its competitor Nikon and Canon SLRs in sub $1000 category.I can say that K-01 is a nice camera and at this price point of less than $350, it is really a steal.

It does use the lenses, but depending on what type of lens you have, the functions are extremely limited. I was hoping I could set the aperture and F-stop manually, but with the lenses I had, the camera assumes a preset aperture, and you can only adjust the speed by changing the ISO speed.  I was going to keep it anyway, except one of the main uses I would have for the camera is outdoor shots at airshows on bright days. There is no viewfinder, so you have to look at the display to frame your picture, and bright sun just makes it too hard to see. It did take excellent pictures, especially in low light. If you have more modern lenses, or buy the new lenses with the camera, and can do without a viewfinder, this would be a great camera. I loved the color, and the looks.

So when K01 went on sale, I decided to get one. I expected the same image quality, plus AF, plus image stabilization, plus aperture control. The K01 fell short in every department. The image quality is nowhere as good as I was getting from Sony: the noise noticeably higher (both OOC jpegs and RAW), the resolution and contrast also noticeably worse, and colors, especially at high ISO are not even close to Sony. I didn't notice if image stabilization added anything, and the AF is pretty much useless. AF is so slow I can manually focus with Sony focus peaking at the same speed, it's also less reliable than focusing manually.
