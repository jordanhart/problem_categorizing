{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally, the perfect camera!", "Author": "Justin T", "ReviewID": "R3U754B8IQ97QM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been waiting a lifetime for this camera and it was worth the wait!  It provides excellent quality shots in the smallest possible sized body.  I am a point-and-shoot user who has been disappointed with the photo quality that comes from even expensive point-and-shoot cameras but who has never bought a DSLR because I knew I would never want to lug one around.  If this describes you, then this is your perfect camera.  Or, if you own a DSLR and use 5% or less of the features on your camera, this is also the camera for you.  On the other hand, if you're a skilled DSLR user, skip this camera because you'll be frustrated the compromises that make this camera a smart choice for the average consumer.Why is this camera \"perfect\" if you're a typical or even advanced point-and-shoot user?COMPARED WITH POINT-AND-SHOOTS, you'll immediately see the following improvements:- Low light/indoor shots are dramatically better- Quicker shutter response time- Ability to do continuous shooting at 7 frames per second and other DSLR-like features- Great HD videoCOMPARED WITH DSLRs, you get:- A much smaller camera than a DSLR that you can actually carry around on a regular basis- As good or better HD video because of the advanced auto-focus technology in the Sony Alpha Nex which does a better job of continuous auto-focus than the average DSLR- Photo quality that is comparable to a DSLR for the average user (again, if you're an advanced DSLR user, skip this camera)- An easier-to-use camera that was designed to make the most important features very accessible with the advanced features tucked away in the menus.  The advanced features are there if you need them but if you're more likely to set the camera on the auto setting, you won't need the advanced stuff much and will appreciate how straight-forward the camera is to use.COMPARED WITH OTHER WANNABE PERFECT CAMERAS, you'll be glad you waited for the Sony Alpha Nex because it's:- Smaller in size than the other options- Has better photo performance due to the larger APS-C sensor (12X the size of a typical point-and-shoot and also significantly larger than the competitive Micro Four Thirds sensor)- Has better video performance- Is similar or cheaper in priceOther wannabe \"perfect cameras\" I've considered and almost purchased have all been \"Micro Four-Thirds\" cameras, which owned this category of cameras before the arrival of the Sony Alpha Nex.Panasonic Lumix GF1: Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 12.1MP Micro Four-Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-45mm LensOlympus PEN E-PL1: Olympus PEN E-PL1 12.3MP Live MOS Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Digital Zoom Lens (Black)And I am glad I waited.  The Sony Alpha Nex has better photo and video performance than both, a smaller form factor than both and is cheaper than the Panasonic (though slightly more expensive than the Olympus which cut its price when the Sony was announced).As for the Nex-3 vs Nex-5, if you care about the dollars involved in the price difference, then you should get the Nex-3. Three key differences are not really worth the added cost if you're looking to maximize value: (1) the typical user will not see a noticeable difference between the higher 1080i video resolution in the Nex-5 vs the 720p resolution in the Nex-3 (and I have a hard time believing that home movies can even benefit from the higher resolution). (2) The Nex-5 has a metal body vs plastic for the Nex-3 which is an aesthetic nice-to-have but not a need-to-have. (3) The Nex-5 is marginally smaller in two of the three dimensions (0.2 inch and 0.1 inch). Because of the overall size of the camera with its lens, shaving a little off of the height and width just won't make a practical difference.  Spend your savings on stuff that will actually impact how you use the camera like a spare battery or a larger memory card.Other things to note:- The flash is small and detachable, and it's different than almost any other camera you're considering.  PRO: you don't need it often because of the great low-light performance and you get a more compact camera as a result.  CON: there's a part you can lose or forget to bring with you if you really need it.- If you're looking to own multiple lenses, there aren't many available lenses directly compatible with the camera and they're expensive compared to competing lines.  But for the advanced point-and-shoot user, you don't need multiple lenses; just the 18-55mm or if you splurge, the 18-200mm when it comes out (expected fall 2010).  But if you have the 18-200mm, the even larger lens starts to erode the benefit of the small body.- While this is very compact compared to a DSLR, it's not really going to fit in a pocket (though it will fit into a purse).  The lens still juts out like on a DSLR so it won't be portable like an ultra-compact point-and-shoot.  But for high quality shots, there isn't a smaller camera than this one.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent, for what it is", "Author": "J. Wischkaemper", "ReviewID": "R1TCQ5NSPCQGSQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Mirrorless SLR's are the current hot thing. I've done wedding photography for years on the side, and when I want to be serious about taking pictures I lug a bag full of pro-level lenses and cameras around. Frankly, that gets old, especially when you're on vacation. I've been hoping for quite a while to find a camera that would offer SLR-like quality in a smaller form factor that would allow it to be carried around all day with minimal effort. I owned a Panasonic LX-2 and more recently a Canon Powershot S90, and while both were decent cameras, I never really fell in love with their images.The NEX-3 is a classic case of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. On the upside, the sensor is excellent, even by modern SLR standards. You're not quite on the cutting edge (think Pentax K-5), but you're pretty darn close - certainly exceeding the previous generation of SLR sensors. With a plethora of adapters for other lenses, high quality glass is also available, and can produce some rather stunning pictures. The small and light form factor allows you to carry the NEX-3 places you wouldn't want to take a larger SLR (even a consumer-level one), and the adjustable screen gives you the ability to hold the camera in ways that just aren't possible with a traditional camera, allowing you to be very creative.Unfortunately, as has been stated many times before, the control layout is a bit poor, though honestly it's completely manageable. Things are not as quick or elegant as they could (or maybe should) be, but the camera is perfectly usable. The biggest current downside is available lens selection, which is limited to three kit-lens quality lenses, which are extremely overpriced for what you get. While the lens that comes with this kit (the 18-55) is not awful, it won't win any awards for optical quality either. The other available lenses are a 16mm prime and a 18-200, the latter of which costs close to $800 dollars - a lot of money to spend for a non-pro lens.The real question, though, is the future of the format. Sony has announced an aggressive roadmap (7 new lenses in the next 2 years), but we know very few actual details about the lenses that will come out. Does a \"high quality standard zoom\" mean a 17-55 f2.8, or a 17-40 f4? How much might this lens cost? Will any third party manufacturers produce lenses for the E-mount? How committed is Sony to using this mount going forward? What is the relative level of effort between the A-mount and E-mount lens design groups? All of these are currently unknowns.If you're a pro for whom $550 doesn't sound like a big deal when buying a camera, then this is a great little toy. Light, fun, good image quality in a small package.If you're looking at this as a long-term alternative to an SLR, remember that in the land of higher end cameras, you're buying into a system, more than buying a single camera. That system is so uncertain at the moment that it's impossible to say whether it will be worth additional investment in two years.If you're looking for a one-off camera purchase that will give you better results than the point and shoot's out there, this is a camera you should look at.Above all, the NEX-3 is an impressive technical achievement, and a fun little toy to play with. More than a toy, it is completely capable of producing gallery-quality prints when paired with competent glass. It certainly hasn't replaced my camera bag, but it's allowed me to leave it at home and still have confidence that I can capture great images.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera with poor battery life", "Author": "Julie Le", "ReviewID": "R16881TAZPHZSP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The reviewer above did an excellent review, so mine will pale in comparison. I bought this camera the very first day it was available (June 29) and have been playing around with it since. It takes beautiful low light photos, even without a tripod, which I'm very pleased with. I have yet to use the flash that came with it.Anyway, great camera, don't regret my purchase... The only downside that I want to point out is the battery life. I realize the big screen and the continuous autofocus uses up a lot of power, but this camera REALLY sucks up battery power. If you went out for a day of shooting on a fully charged battery, you will need an extra. The camera seems to even suck up a lot of power when it's not even on. There is new firmware that claims to reduce battery consumption when off, so hopefully that will be an improvement. Which leads to another downside, which is that firmware is only available for Windows and not Mac.Other than that, beautiful beautiful camera.*** Just a note that the battery life has improved greatly after the firmware update. Much happier with the camera now!", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "good for what it is, but pickier buyers may not be satisfied", "Author": "David Eng", "ReviewID": "R1QOTIJ9EOT9H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update: with latest firmware updates, the battery life glitch and start up times have been vastly improved.The reviews of this camera are pretty correct - if you are a compact point and shoot person that wants to move up to greater picture quality but not necessarily wanting to put up with the bulk of a SLR or the complications of different aspects of photography, then this camera should do nicely for you.Pros:1) cost - for what it is, it could have been more expensive, though the additional lenses will cost you.2) size - it really is a small body, comparable to some of the larger point and shoots. It's also a nice looking camera, if you care about those kinds of things (I have the red model, which is particularly cute).3) picture quality - out of the box has been better than my previous point and shooters with the ability to do background defocus and panoramic shots.4) shutter speed - camera really is fast and you'll see a big decrease in blurry pictures, even with action shots5) low light shooting - camera comes with a flash but the camera's able to take decent pictures in low light settings without the flash.6) flip screen - pretty handy for shooting different angles.7) video quality is good and has all the pluses of being able to shoot video with an SLR type camera - changeable lenses/settings, high quality.Cons:1) battery life could be better - I shot about 100 photos and the battery drained down to about 33% after about 2 hours of shooting2) navigation speed - the camera is slow when jumping between shoot mode and playback mode. NOTE: this issue seems to have been addressed with the firmware update.3) navigation - it did seem to be a bit cumbersome that there isn't a back button to go back to where you navigated from4) picture quality - I know I listed this as a pro, one bit of downside on the automatic settings is that sometimes the color is not as vibrant as probably the SLRs are capable of - you might need to futz with the manual settings to capture the best color. In some settings, particularly low light, some of the colors seem a bit washed out.5) LCD screen is not the most visible in sunlight and gets smudgy at times.6) would have been nice if it came with body cap and lens back cap, so that you could store the lens and body separately.7) movie artifacts - sometimes, at the end of a clip, there may be some jagged artifacts. These can probably be snipped off by video editing software.I'm pretty happy with this camera, though I imagine that an SLR can probably take better pictures - though you'd have to learn how to do so.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture quality, get the firmware update if you want better controls", "Author": "U Lala", "ReviewID": "RV4X9PSSZBT68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the Mustang of digital cameras. Tons of horsepower, no sophistication. This is about as much bang-for-buck picture quality you can get in a reasonably small package. What I'm talking about is ISO performance. It's all good all the way up to ISO 3200, and ISO 6400 is surviveable, especially if you shoot RAW. That's about 1.5-2 stops better than a micro 4/3rds. The 18-55 kit lens is decently sharp. Too bad you can't get too close to do macro shots (you'll have to get a close-up filter kit, which is another inconvenience). I can't comment on the 16mm prime, since I don't have it. For [...] shipped with kit zoom lens, that's quite a deal.The autofocus is pretty fast, though sometimes it has to hunt a little, especially in the dark. In most cases it's about as fast as my brother's Panasonic GF1, which is commendable.As you probably already know, the flash comes as a hotshoe add-on (included with purchase). It screws on to lock. It's pretty well diffused but quite weak in range. The operation is pretty simple: flip up to activate flash, flip down to deactivate.The panoramic mode is very well done. It is smooth and intuitive, and the results usually come out great.Operation is pretty fast, though is you set it to auto review after ever shot (which everyone does) and then try to zoom in during the review, it will lag for a second or two.The 720p movies are fantastic in quality. Built-in stereo mic. Sounds pretty good without having to get the hotshoeHigh resolution LCD screen is always nice. Plus it tilts up and down so you don't have to find a stool to stand on to take that really wide angle downwards picture.The arrangement of the interface is quite horrible. Why does it take so many button presses to get to where I can change ISO? Same for white balance. Why can't I set ISO parameters to, say, between 200 and 3200? There a DEDICATED button for tips. Really? Someone from Sony's engineering department thought it was a great idea to throw away all the important buttons and make a dedicated button for helpful tips?One can make the argument that it is geared towards \"point-and-shoot\" customers, but is that really a valid excuse? Is it so hard to get an APS-C sized sensor in a live-view-oriented body with decent controls? For $550 I'm not going to cry too much about it, but I have to say I was strongly considering the GF1 despite the higher price and huge loss in ISO performance. Just saying, Sony could've made the choice much more obvious by making a more pro-friendly interface and button layout.UPDATE 2010-12-08: Apparently firmware update gives some interface customization options that make life a lot better. You can now map two of the soft keys to do something other than shooting tips.

I bought the double lens package, containing the 16mm pancake lens and 18-55mm lens. During the 6 day period that I was there, I took more than 400 photos. Needless to say, I really like this camera.Its low light performance is very good. I never used the flash for all my shots. In fact, I just kept the flash in my camera bag, never attach it to the camera. High ISO shots are also very good, up to ISO 5000. At ISO 6400 and above, noise start to show. Because of the good high ISO quality, and also with the special handheld twilight option, I can take pictures mostly without a tripod, even during night time. You can see some samples of my pictures in the customer image gallery for Nex 3 and judge it yourself.Some reviews in Internet mentioned about the difficulty of its control interface. Personally I don't find it a hassle. Perhaps it's my style of shooting. I don't change much of the control; mostly only to change the shooting mode (iAuto, handheld twilight, manual, etc.) I find the menu quite user friendly and the in-camera help files are also helpful. To this date I have not read the manual. I just shoot away :)I would recommend this to any amateur photographer, just like myself. I think the pros will find this camera very good too.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best camera I've ever owned!", "Author": "Harrisfire", "ReviewID": "R1OLETWO7YSF6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I've owned dozens of cameras, about two years ago I stepped up to a Canon DSLR and enjoyed it tremendously.  After two years with the DSLR I started looking to replace it with something a little smaller (the size and weight of the SLR making it prohibitive for all my travels/uses).  So I sold off the Canon and ended up buying and returning three different point and shoots before finally stumbling onto the NEX-3!The picture quality easily rivals that of my Canon XSi, yet the size and weight are deceptively small.  As much as I practiced and tried different lenses and techniques, I was never able to get great low-light shots from my XSi, with the 16mm prime lens, the Sony constantly gives me great low light performance - without using the flash.  Speaking of the flash, I was skeptical at first about the whole detachable flash - for fear of losing it or breaking it.  Once I installed it I found that it's really not that obtrusive, when closed (in the down position) it hardly adds any mass to the camera and unless it's in the open position, the camera doesn't even recognize it's presence.Some have complained about the user interface, while I've grown accustomed/spoiled by manual controls the NEX-3 menu system is really easy to navigate.  Even my parents were able to change settings and get some amazing shots without being told how, or looking at a manual.  Some of the \"helpful\" tips are a bit basic, but those can be turned off quite easily.The \"handheld twilight\" mode is amazing, taking several pictures at different exposures then combining them into one - why haven't all camera manufactures jumped on this bandwagon?  Sure you get some color distortion, but the ability to take a picture in all but the darkest settings and still be able to see what was there is mind blowing. How many people with a point and shoot can walk outside at midnight and take a good picture of the moon?  What's that you say?  You don't want to mess with a bunch of settings?  Just set it to intelligent auto mode and let it choose for you!Pleasantly surprised, by far the best camera I've ever owned!

The video quality in 720p mode is generally very good,  but not as good as the Tx7 which is a Sony point and shoot supporting 1080p.

Great cameras, but not what I needed. I then looked over and saw the Sony Nex-3 with the 18-55mm lens and fell in love. It really is a sexy camera. Using it was very easy. After the firmware update to V2.0, the battery life was still really good. I took about 200 pictures at the park and had 66% battery life left. I am impressed.

Brand new cameras don't have the time set already and watching original setups on this camera on You Tube proved that. I also was suspicious when my new SD card pictures started with the number 200. All of this I could accept, but when I downloaded the pictures it took, it was apparent why this camera was returned originally, the pictures were horribly fuzzy. The kit lenses Sony puts on these cameras are hit or miss and other purchasers have had similar problems with the lens, although most do not have any problems and rave about the picture quality. The forums on the Sony NEX-3 have many accounts of poor kit lenses but most customers have had good results when they received a replacement. I am glad I researched this camera before receiving it, as some companies just seem to recycle defective copies until some customer accepts it through lack of awareness. With the large DSLR sized sensor this camera has, the pictures should be sharp enough to cut you, if your not careful. Don't accept anything less.UPDATE: I returned the NEX-3 and bought the NEX-5.

But I bought it to use as my hiking camera and I was very disappointed. The metering is way off in bright situations. I tried the Auto setting and the Program setting with -.7 exposure compensation. The images were fine if they did not include a large section of bright sky, light rock or light colored grasses. In those situations the images were uniformily over-exposed. My current camera for hiking is a Canon SD880IS which also over exposes in bright situations. But, if set at Program mode with -.7 exposure copensation is produces great images. I suppose I could work on each image with the Sony to get it just right but that is not why I use a point and shoot camera.Also, I'd have to say I was not impressed with the contrast in the images I shot outdoors in the Arizona mountains.

Bowman \"Bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R28G3VUFYP2978", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with both lenses, this review emphasizes the performance of the 18-55mm kit lens. (See the other kit for the opposite emphasis.) I had no preconceptions and bought it on a whim, amazed by its size. It's easy to hold, but also easy to cover the AF lamp. With the 16mm lens is actually fits in a large pocket, with the larger lens it needs a large pouch or purse.The 18-55mm lens is very good for daily point-and-shoot, the only downer being its large size. It has IS and performs nicely at both ends of the zoom, the clarity is wonderful, and the detail captured is fantastic; I just wish that the zoom was longer for such a huge lens. The image quality is definitely better than the smaller Olympus E-PL1 & 2. The 16mm lens is only useful for specific wide-angle shots, as it has a serious fisheye effect. I also wish the lens caps tied to the camera.Easily the best feature of the camera is the merge mode that's appeared across most of the Sony line: 5 shots without flash at default shutter merged into one, compensating for any movement, makes for some awesome pics at any light level. However, my HX5 compact has the same feature and looks nearly as good (just takes longer), plus you still have alpha's auto mode problems.An unfortunate downside to the camera is the lack of mode dial. Switching between Auto, 5-shot, and shutter was agonizing when I needed that quick shot, and blinding in the dark, plus is some modes the quick mode change button becomes something else, so that you have to go into the full menu. I despised that delay. I loved that flash could be turned on or off instantly by raising or lowering the physical flash module. It was high enough that there were zero red-eye problems. Sadly, using the flash means no other accessories. The inner lens ring also doesn't control anything that I could tell; I never got it to change aperture, focus, speed, etc. The screen tilt was useless to me without side-tilt.Very problematic is that while Sony designed this camera around Auto mode, it just plain isn't fast or sensitive. In shutter mode, you can ramp down the timing and force it to use much higher ISOs, which still manage to look breathtakingly clear with the large sensor, but Auto mode just plain refuses to use them. If you try to use Auto in dark settings, it will bump the shutter up past 1 second, even with flash. (I got very pissy at the camera at a club when it kept using 3.4s with flash off and 1.8s with flash on, in Auto. ??? Everything was blurry in Auto, of course. It's the only camera I've ever owned to do this.) Due to this, the sensor is crippled, IMHO. If you are willing to use it in shutter mode at night, quality is fantastic. In daylight, Auto will blow you away just fine. Manual mode is such a pain that I skipped it completely; there's no way to adjust ISO quickly.Video looks pretty good. I didn't use it much but it's definitely on par or better than any video camera I've used. Panorama stitch also looks great. Sport mode does not.The battery is surprisingly small, only 1080mAh, when each of my AA are triple that. The camera will last a few hours, but my old Canon S2 can do 2-3 times as many pictures easily. I nearly ran out of juice one night. Invest in a spare.My final verdict: A study in compromises that turn a fantastic sensor into a mediocre product. If you want it, get this 18-55 zoom lens kit.

I compared the pictures taken with this camera under low light conditions with those from a Olympic E-PL1 (w/ 14-42 mm stock lens) and the images from NEX are truly superior.- Small form factor, especially when you use the 16mm E-mount lens (but be warned that this particular lens does not have built-in image stabilization, so it might not be a good fit for shooting under low light conditions).Cons:- Camera controls are really hard to use. Adjusting most common settings (ISO, metering mode, auto focus, etc.) require several key presses. This is a huge disadvantage compared to traditional DSLRs since you might already lose that precious moment after fiddling with the controls.Tips:- Get a screen protector right away.

I was impressed by the abundant features and actually got my parents a WX5 by October (see my other reviews). The WX5/Hx5v are great toys that lured me into taking more pictures than I would have with my Canon. However, pixel peeping the pictures from a 1/2.3\" sensor makes me want to get a something even bigger and better. Not quite ready for carrying a full DSLR for every day use I was aiming for a MFT but from the reviews I read I opt for the NEX 3 for it's performance/$.Got my NEX3K (with 18-55mm) used for the price of a new Canon S95 I start the experiment to see if it can replace my Hx5v. The learning curve is steeper than I expected since I am used to the 10x zoom with a finger and also changing mode with a quick dial. Removing the camera cap is one of the inconvenience I have to get used to and after a month of trial I have the following conclusion (mostly comparing with my Hx5v, canon P&S;).Pro:1) Much sharper images and great DOF, color/brightness/exposure are quite accurate.2) Love the tilt-able screen, now I don't have to put my chin on the ground to take low shots3) Decent 720p video in mp4 (not as good as the 1080 from my Hx5v)4) Programmable soft keys (v03) - takes a while to get used to.5) Size/weight - still fit my jacket pocket and easy enough to sometimes do one hand shotCon:1) Wish it has more soft keys/dedicated button or AT LEAST a MODE DIAL!!!2) Loud shutter (no more stealth photography and multi-shots becomes a disturbance!)3) AutoFocus is slower than I expect and not as smart as I want it to be4) The e-mount 18-200mm tele lens cost $800!@%$5) Sweep Panorama is much harder to master than the Hx5vI don't think this camera can completely replace by Hx5v but I do get fond of using it to take still shots.

In short, it is your DSLR sensor you can take with you for great price and small body. It is not advanced DSLR replacement, but you can make good pictures with it if you pay attention how and what you do.Positive:+ Good in low light and indoor, one of the best sensors you can have for the money+ User interface I found easy to learn and use, however takes time to adjust shots for preference+ Compact, compared to real DSLR-s, but however, due to large lens not so compact to carry around+ Good HDR, Anti Motion Blur and burst shooting modes. The first two make real difference to picture quality+ Adequate lens, but you will not know what quality sensor you have inside camera until you try it with some fixed primes+ Endless choice of adapters in e-bay, for using your vintage manual lenses+ Quite good video quality, no matter it is not full HD+ Microphones produce distinctive stereo picture of sound+ Sony really updates the software of the camera, right now v05+ After software update the autofocus is quicker (not DSLR quick, but decent)+ With latest software you can configure buttons to your liking (makes life lot easier)+ Stronger than expected body of the camera (survived drop on camera with 2kg lens attached)Negative:- White balance with Sony lenses tends to be blueish, also not very constant (just move your frame by inch and white balance colors change dramatically)- Some not so good menu limitations, like no EVO settings when in auto mode- 18-55 lens is so-so. It is not the worst also, but expected better from Sony- Still small and expensive choice of lenses on the market (but some are very good)- Microphone is wind sensitive (I made my own hairy windscreen, did DIY video in YouTube dutyhook channel)So in conclusion, it one of the best sensors on the market you can get for the money. If you use some old vintage lenses with adapter you can blow even professional photographers away with your photos (reviews state that Sigma 19, 30, and Sony 50 lenses are good).

I bought a Canon XSI and through the next few years, I struggled to get the right shot.  At some point, I realized that there were several struggles for me to get the, perfect shot.(1) lack of low light capabilities, solved with a external bounce flash and a diffuser(2) focus on the wrong subject, band-aided with using single point focus and always having the person in the center(3) camera never ready, band-aided with a sling shoulder strap and a messenger bag w/insert...always have the camera with and ready assembled (not pleasant having 4lbs swinging at one's hip)However, things that I could never address(1) camera huge with external flash, what is the point of having a camera if it gets in the way of experiencing the event.  I also want professional shots w/o looking like a professional.(2) Really wanted face detection to have a better chance of having perfect focus(3) No video without upgrading to a newer DSLR(4) No live view without upgrading so I can't give to others to take a shot of my familyI think my greatest issue with DSLR quality is that I need to have a DSLR (huge, size, need skill to know how to get the right shot for the right conditions, complexity).  I think that this is a real risk that most people will be taking smartphone shots for their precious moments so I wasn't ready to give up, besides smartphones is a huge step in the wrong direction.

It's compact enough that it never takes me out of experiencing an event and small enough to have on my person.  I takes video and has face detection.  I can also do some special effects like defocusing the background for portraits, negates the need to have a portrait prime lens.  It's got a flip out live view for over the head shots and giving to others to take pictures of us.  It's got DSLR quality, the sensor is the same size, not even that of a four thirds camera which is smaller.  It's got a super cool 360 shot which it automatically stitches together shots for a super wide angle panaramic shot.  Lastly, it has super high low light sensitivity so I don't need to use a flash for indoor shots, though it has a nice little external included.

After reading about the new generation of small, mirrorless-interchangeable lens cameras, like the Nikon J1-V1, Panasonic Micro Four-Thirds and the Olympus, I decided to buy the Sony Nex 3.The main reason was the sensor: the Nex is the only camera of this new generation of mirrorles cameras with an APS sensor, the sensor used in most DSLRs today. Neither of the other cameras has a sensor this big, so the improvement in quality, in terms of detail and background defocus is assured; Second consideration was the ability to use my alpha lens. The Nex E mount is completely different than the alpha mount, but I found a very good and affordable adapter to do the job (see details below).I have been testing the camera for 2 days now; I'm impressed with the speed (7 frames per second, that's even more speed than my a500, which gives me 5 fps), and also the ease of use of the Nex 3 camera. My 11 year daughter is very happy taking pictures and recording HD videos. Yesterday she asked me for a photo session in the evening, and the camera responded well in low light conditions (little noise). For this type of situation, I specially liked the Hand-held Twilight Mode, where the camera quickly combines several shots into one still image to reduce camera shake and noise, the quality of Nex 3 pictures in low light is even better than what I get with my DSLR (Sony a500); Today, I tested the camera with 2 alpha telephoto lenses using the RainbowImaging adapter. In this regard I found very easy to apply the necessary configurations (basically customizing the B and C soft keys for the Manual Focus Assist and the ISO control). I'm very accustomed to the inside-camera image stabilization system of the alpha cameras, and also to the autofocus function. I missed these functions while combining the Nex and the alpha lenses, but the manual focus assist and a bean bag over my car were very useful to picture a tree and see how rich the detail is with this all gear (You can see my review of RainbowImaging adapter at the product site in Amazon.com: RainbowImaging Sony Alpha & Minolta AF lenses to Sony E-Mount NEX-3 NEX-5 NEX-VG10 Camera Mount Adapter (with aperture control). I uploaded some pictures of the lenses mounted and test pictures). In the end, E mount telephoto lenses are going to be needed if you want permanent-versatile image stabilization and autofocus, but for occasional use, I think I have the best of both worlds. The downside: the battery life is very short, and the official accesories are expensive and not so useful (I talk about the  optional viewfinder and the optional alpha to E mount adapter). Fortunately, there are third party solutions for this.Conclusion: very happy with the Nex 3 camera and the RainbowImaging adapter. make no mistakes, this is no point and shoot camera.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "First edition Nex camera", "Author": "Four Eyes", "ReviewID": "R1SH6LVYK7TT5Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nex-3 is the first edition of the NEX series.

In Intelligent Auto mode, it has a feature to increase blur in background--foolproof!!  There are also a few modes that you can increase lighting in a low light situation(S,P modes)--I experimented in a semi dark room last night and the picture turned out great with no flash.  I've only had it for a few days at this point, so there is a lot more to experiment with (haven't tried the HD video or a lot of the cool scene settings), but I'm really happy so far.

The best of the APS cameras, such as the mid-range Canon and Nikon SLRs, take great photos.  I eagerly awaited the availability of the Sony NEX line hoping to get similar image quality in a light, compact instrument.Well... no such luck.  Detail is rendered with a soft, diffuse quality that produces the opposite of a fine photograph.  It could be crummy optics, it could be due to a software decision Sony engineers have made for the NEX target market, or who knows what?  The bottom line is that colors, textures, and spatial relationships are vague and fall apart when enlarged.  The images are a mess to behold.If Sony engineers know how to cure this, better glass would be my guess, they should do so at once.  Otherwise, the existential failure of a big heroic sensor unable to deliver fine images will be the nexus of the camera's demise.Prepare to return your new NEX-3 after a look-see.
