{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Mrs. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R3OCTA798JCE61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new Canon 70D. I purchased it as a replacement for the T2i which I had had for two and a half years and had outgrown. I saw the 70D as the next step in my development as a photographer. I have had it for two months now and realize I don't really need all the lenses and extras that came with the package. I have only used the 50mm lens to train myself to use a lens that has only one focal length.All in all I have made the right decision and I am enjoying learning my new camera as I become a better photographer.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incredible bargain!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R311J6LLCIXC9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a great camera bundle with everything I needed to get started in photography. This is it. The 70D camera body has more features and technology than I'll ever learn to use. The lenses are pretty basic, with overlapping zoom ranges. You'll need to get another lens to cover the under 50 mm range. But all in all, I've had a lot of fun with this bundle and the price can't be beat.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for low light gymnastics shots!", "Author": "Die Hard Fan", "ReviewID": "R2NWPHV1PFRCHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera & accessories for my husband.

Easy to use...and great features.  Really nice Canon lenses that came in package.

The shipping was fast. Everything works perfectly. Of course the carrying case or the tripod or the filters are not the best but they are good to start taking pics, they will help you for the moment )you will have to get them later on your own).. in conclusion I'm very happy I did it! the camera is great! I totally recommend the seller :)", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,499.99", "Features": "Canon EOS 70D 20.2 MP Dual Pixel CMOS Digital SLR Camera Body Brand New USA w/ All Supplied Manufacturer Accessories\nCanon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens Brand New USA w/Manufacturer's Supplied Accessories\nCanon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS AF Lens Brand New USA w/Manufacturer's Supplied Accessories\nCanon EF 50mm f/1.8 II SLR Lens Brand New USA w/Supplied Manufacturer Accessories\n(See Description for More Details)", "Name": "Canon EOS 70D 20.2 MP Dual Pixel CMOS Digital SLR Camera + EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III & EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens + Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II SLR Lens + Two LP-E6 Replacement Lithium Ion Battery & Charger Kit + 32GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card & Wallet + 58mm Wide Angle & 2x Telephoto Lens + 58mm 3 Piece Filter & Macro Close Up Kit + Mini HDMI Cable + Carrying Case + Full Size Tripod + Multi Card USB Reader + Deluxe Starter Kit DavisMAX Bundle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/611P7t963cL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ESF6PDY"}}
