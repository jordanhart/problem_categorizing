I looked around both online (and locally) and simply couldn't find a better deal than this. Shipping took a little while due to the blizzard back east, but I'm glad I waited. The camera was in excellent condition with no sleepy pixles. The remote control shutter wasn't working so I called Cameta and they said they'd send me a replacement immediately. That aside, all the items were in great order. This is a great package at an AMAZING price - I couldn't find better elsewhere.
