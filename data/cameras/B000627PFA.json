When you don't zoom in they come out alright, but when you do use the zoom to 2x (it goes to 4x) your pictures come out all blurry and horendous, don't even try 4x, its horrible, it may be a good price, but not good quality", "Date": "November 11, 2004"}, {"Title": "The Vivitar 3750 Has No Optical Zoom", "Author": "Jacob A. Furchak", "ReviewID": "RJGF7QUHMKBYI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Last summer I was searching for a camera to snap pictures of my trip overseas and I came across the Vivicam 3750 on this website. I quickly bought the camera and used it non-stop over the following month. Recently, I wondered how the Vivicam compares with some new cameras in the same price range. After a few minutes of searching I decided that the Kodak Easyshare camera is a close comparison to the Vivicam as I compared the internal memory, photo quality, the type of lens, and eventually the camera's price. When I searched for a camera my first criteria was the optical quality or the amount of mega-pixels that the camera has, which specifies the size of the image that the camera can take. The Vivicam has 3.1 mega-pixels and it can take quality photographs up to 8 x 10-inches. Cameras in a higher price range only went up to 6 mega-pixels, so I was getting a good deal. The Kodak Easyshare camera has a slightly higher figure at 3.2 mega-pixels and it can take photo-quality pictures up to 10 x 13-inches of picture. This was not a big point of contention for me because when I turned on the Vivicam I changed the quality to the lowest setting so I could take more pictures. Another criteria for buying a camera is its internal memory. Both the Vivicam and the Easyshare accept SD memory cards, and the Vivicam additionally seems to accept MMC memory cards. Both cameras only have 16 megabytes of internal memory so the additional memory is essential. I did not consider the type of lens and optics at the point of sale but I intend to consider this in the future. The Easyshare camera has a 3x optical zoom lens in addition to its 3.3x digital zoom software while the Vivicam can only use digital zoom which enlarges up to 4 times by intentionally blurring the picture. After using the Vivicam for more than a month I realize that digital zoom does not make up for the lack of optical zoom, especially when photographing.  Basically the Kodak Easyshare would have been a much better choice for me to buy since I would have enjoyed its optical zoom feature while snapping things around town, and it is the same price that I originally bought the Vivicam at a few months ago. All of the other features were roughly parallel in these two cameras.", "Date": "November 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "the best", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R27AFUDJ42ZOM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have been thru many camera in this price range,but non have been this good. it takes great photos . the zoom takes great photos , not blury at all . i have had this camera for seven months . i have droped it many times . i have spilt soda on it . but it still works great . it takes about 2 secends to take the photo . but that is no reason not to buy this great camera.", "Date": "July 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very disgusted!", "Author": "momofdancingdiva", "ReviewID": "R2PUSBZHPKGGWL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was a gift for my son.  The display is too dark to see the person/item you are trying to photograph.  The pics come out totally dark.  We have tried every setting possible to add more light, and no luck!  I have a fugi with the same amount of megapixels and it takes perfect pics!  I tried to contact vivitar to ask for help, and received no response.

By the way, All digital zooms are poor regardless of the camera. If you want a zoom feature get an opitical zoom camera and pay more. This little guy does not have optical zoom but it takes fantastic pics without it in the normal mode. 3.2MP is as much or more than most people need. This little camera delivers quick recharge for that next pic and the quality is not dissapointing.When you want quality snapshots at the spur of the moment and you don't want to carry around an expensive overly complicated digital get the 3750 and forget about it. Get a 128MB or higher SD card and an inexpensive Mercury SD card reader for your PC and Enjoy!", "Date": "May 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "I can always count on this camera.", "Author": "P. Fiesta", "ReviewID": "R1O1OSO8XV97RQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Vivicam has been with me for almost 4 years now, and I've had no MAJOR problems with it. Compared to the HP Photosmart that I bought (when I thought I lost this camera), the HP was far more expensive and didn't even last a YEAR! For the HP, I had to buy a memory card just to even use it! With my Vivicam, I didn't even need a card to begin taking pictures! Also, HP did not provide a carrying case for its camera, while my Vivicam did.I was reluctant to find this camera again prior to my HP camera breaking.The only minor problems I've had with this camera is that at times, it does take some dark pictures if they are hardly any light. It does not keep the date/time in your camera too well. I hardly set it anymore. I have also started using the video features on this camera, and I wished it was more clearer and had sound.If you want a camera primarily for simple, everyday pictures, for a cheap price, then I recommend this one. If you want to get fancy, that does all sorts of stuff, then look for another.", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3.1-megapixel digital camera for photo-quality 8 x 10-inch enlargements\nFixed focus lens; 2x digital zoom; built-in flash with red-eye reduction\nCaptures short video clips (no audio); PC Web cam capability\nInternal 16MB memory; compatible with SD and MMC memory cards\nPowered by 2 AA batteries (alkalines included); connects via USB 1.1 to PCs and Macs", "Name": "Vivitar Vivicam 3750 3.2MP Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XSJ95H99L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000627PFA"}}
