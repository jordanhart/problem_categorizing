{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Some people just LIVE to complain", "Author": "oldpink \"Dark Side of the Moon\"", "ReviewID": "R3E1YFWTOFS6RJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I did not buy mine from Amazon, instead electing to get it instantly at Wal-Mart.I am also far from a camera expert.With that said, I was quite pleased with this camera, which was a huge upgrade over my old Kodak DC340.First, I REALLY like the generous 12x zoom with this camera, which enabled me to get excellent quality photos with good detail of two particular wary birds, a Bob White quail, and an Eastern Bluebird.I also found the imagine stabilization feature useful for my less than completely still hands, and I need to reiterate that image stabilization has NOTHING to do with capturing a fast moving object, as Spacejockey seemed to believe.Also, far from being annoyed by the flash having a button to pop it up, I really like being able to manually disable flash by leaving the flash physically latched down instead of having to mess around with menu controls to do it.I fail to see how this is a negative, Spacejockey.Likewise, I quite liked the intelligent face detection feature, which seemed to be particularly useful for the excellent automatic red eye removal feature.Again, Spacejockey, why the grumbling about this feature?Another point of contention is the gripe about the \"double clicking\" when taking photos.Well, you can override that by pressing the shutter button completely without pause, but the first click is to allow you ensure your lens is fully focused on your target before committing to taking the shot.You can press halfway, see if the focus indicator is on your target, then squeeze the rest of the way to take the shot.Again, why the complaint about that?Regarding the yellowish cast to photos taken indoors without flash, that is easily overcome by using the basic manual controls, which allow you to set the exposure appropriate to the lighting, which includes the \"Tungsten\" setting that is indicated for use indoors under incandescent lighting.Problem solved, and I have to wonder why Spacejockey couldn't trouble himself to look into that before grumbling about that.One point where I must agree with Spacejockey is the idiotic choice of micro USB connector instead of the far more common and useful mini USB connector used on most other portable electronic devices.It's not as if this large camera had a space constraint to require that.Was Fuji simply out to make its customers carry an extra cable instead of the mini-USB they already have for their other devices?One related complaint of my own, since I find myself instead electing to pop out the SD card to insert into an external card reader, is that it was a poor choice indeed to put the SD card slot inside the battery compartment, thus requiring the camera be powered off and having a fragile battery door undergo a finite open/close cycle that will accelerate it breaking and reducing the camera to an expense block of plastic.Also, Spacejockey, macro mode should NEVER use zoom.You want more detail for a close object, I suggest you GET CLOSER.Sheesh!Again, I have to disagree about the menu system, which I found easy to figure out, without really having to resort to the manual.I also really like how large the LCD display is.I tend to agree with the complaint about the lack of a printed manual, but this is a sad trend among electronic manufacturers these days.Witness the utter lack of printed documentation AT ALL when you open up that stylish box your iPod comes in.Regarding the inability to read the documenation found on the CD, I would suggest you contact Fuji to let them know that your disk was scratched and unreadable on a number of different computersm, and request they send you a free undamaged CD.Regarding the panorama mode, I would not even consider using that in the field, unless I had a tripod and carefully positioned each shot to make the overlap as seamless as possible.Failing that, I would do it up right on my computer with an image editor, so I have to wonder again at what seems a gratuitous gripe about a feature that Spacejockey probably never intended to use anyway.Speaking of gripes, why the grumbling about lack of filters or lens accessories on a camera that is NOT an SLR?This is a mid to high end point-and-shoot camera, and a motorized lens that moves in and out can get easily damaged by a filter or other such appliance attached to it.Spacejockey, have you really thought that complaint through?Sorry to sound as if I have some kind of axe to grind with Spacejockey, but I am a firm believer that a critical review really should focus upon being both fair and factual, and too many of the gripes leveled at this low to mid range camera seemed really lacking in both departments.Anyone who has used the pocket sized point-and-shoot cameras, such as my old Kodak, will immediately see the improvement of this camera over those, but anyone wanting all the features demanded by Spacejockey would be better served with one of the better digital SLR cameras instead.However, those SLR cameras are also targeted more at the experienced photographer, thus requiring far more manual control over the camera.Again, there is nothing wrong with a critical review, but I have to be critical of SJ's review itself.Nothing

Heintz", "ReviewID": "RLV41C047KV1Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a serious amateur photographer for more than 20 years and have a large collection of cameras for my photography needs.  I recently purchased my S1500 while traveling in Asia over the past couple of weeks.  I decided to leave my DSLR behind on this trip and had only packed my point-and-shoot.  After a few days, I realized that I needed more camera to capture the sights of Singapore, Indonesia and Australia.  The Fuji S1500 seemed to fit the bill and was a comparable price in Singapore to purchasing it here in the USA and had the zoom capabilities and other features I wanted in a compact camera.First use:I took the camera out for a walking tour in Singapore and captured some great shots in both SR Auto and P mode.  Focus is sharp and the colors are great.  OK, so with outdoor daytime shots working, I thought I would try some night shots.I went to the top of the Swissotel in Singapore at night for some night landscape shots.  I placed the camera on the ledge against the window (to avoid the reflections), set it to SR Auto and used the 2 second self-timer, then pressed the button and stepped back.  I got some stunning photos of the Singapore skyline at night (including the Singapore Flyer).Full test:I put the camera to full use in Sydney where I took nearly 400 photos.  I took some great handheld photos of the Opera House and the Harbor Bridge during the morning.  I also tried the in camera panorama.  I got a great shot that includes the bridge, opera house and botanical gardens.  I could have done the same thing in Photoshop, but hey, why not let the camera do it for me.We then hopped onto one of the open top bus tours (a bit cold as it is winter in Sydney), but still fun.  Even with the bounce of the bus, I was able to get some great pictures with this camera thanks to the Dual IS feature.  The zoom also helped a lot as the bus didn't always get as close as I would have liked.Final stop was the botanical gardens.  I took some good macro shots that rival those I have taken with my EOS Digital SLR.  It is important to note that you don't zoom in Macro mode.Final thoughts:This is not a replacement for a DSLR.  However, if you are looking for more power in a travel / vacation camera than is offered by traditional 3x point-and-shoot models, this is a good buy.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "An Overlooked Beauty for an Astounding Price", "Author": "Gregory Wood", "ReviewID": "RWME4CB6BLOKW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an overall package, this camera is simply astounding. Besides a few minor flaws, you get a nearly perfect, highly versatile camera with a fairly expansive feature set and good image quality for less than $200. What more can you ask for? Well, there are a few things, but let me first start with the pros...+ Excellent price. Obviously, getting this kind of technology for less than $200 is a rare find. Fuji somehow keeps prices at the low end of the spectrum, while managing to maintain quality.+ Good construction. This thing feels solid, and fits nicely in the hands. I don't have any qualms about apparent quality or cheapness; for $200, you'd be hard-pressed to find something with comparable materials and build quality.+ Large feature set. The feature set really is as expansive as the description says. As mentioned before, some of them aren't quite as good as they sound, but that will be discussed next. I'm not a even nearly a professional photographer, and I'm certainly still learning, but the upgrade from a 'normal' point-and-shoot is significant. Shutter and aperture priority modes are excellent, as is the full-manual mode. Automatic modes are just your normal automatic modes, with the exception of the SP 'scene selection' mode, which offers some nice settings if you find yourself in a hurry to get a shot or are unsure of how to compose a picture yourself. Fortunately, with the versatile manual modes, you'll find yourself using automatic modes less and less as you become more comfortable with the settings.+ The zoom is great, as is the stabilization system. 12x zoom is more than enough for most realistic applications- if you need any more than that on a regular basis, you should really be looking at an SLR system anyways. When you get up to the 8x-12x range, you'll likely need a small tripod or something to set the camera on, or a very fast shutter speed, but that's pretty standard- no amount of stabilization can accommodate fully for a 12x zoom.+ Super-macro mode takes some astounding close-ups. By far, this is my favorite mode.+ Image quality, for $200, is superior. Although I have seen sharper images, they are usually coming from highly sophisticated SLR systems- not exactly what you'd call comparable.+Speed, although not great, is good enough to keep up with demands from normal photographers. There's a small, but noticeable, amount of shutter lag- nothing that will detract from your photographic endeavors. Time between shots seems to be on par with most other digital cameras of the class. With the right settings, you'll be able to capture most images with reasonable success.The negatives:-Autofocus. This can be sloppy sometimes, failing to focus or focusing incorrectly. Although this might be due to my inexperience, I often find myself wishing for a manual focus. Then again, that's just something you have to deal with when you forego spending thousands of dollars on an SLR system.-Lens. Although it's normally fine, I sometimes find myself wishing for a larger aperture and/or shutter speed range. The shutter speed range of 8-1/2000 seconds is usually more than fast enough, but I do find myself sometimes unable to compose a shot correctly because of a lack of aperture range. 99% of the time this has no relevance outside of extreme low-light or high-light imagine that as I become more competent with the settings, this issue will become less pronounced.-Unusable features. This is one of my biggest peeves with the camera. Sure, it's great to offer ISO 6400, but why bother when any pictures taken in that mode inevitably end up as nothing more than a noisy mess? I appreciate the attempt on Fuji's part, but I would have rather had them dedicate the resources to extra shooting modes, a faster lens, a better lens cover, or any number of other, more practical aspects. Don't get me wrong- most of the features are fine. Just don't try to shoot anything above ISO 800, and don't expect high-quality video.Overall, despite a few downfalls, this is an exceedingly pleasing camera, and one that I feel is often overlooked in the Mega-Zoom discussion solely because of the Fuji name. Nonetheless, this camera can easily compete with almost any other camera of the `SLR-like' class, regardless of brand- and the price is certainly right. Invest the $200 in this wonderful little package of technology, and you won't be sorry.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "A good nice size camera with high end features.", "Author": "Buzzzmike \"buzzzmike2\"", "ReviewID": "R14K9D1ZLXYS56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Read all the reviews posted about this gem, and have a few responses (Omitting mechanical breakage issues):1.  Video?  You want a video camera, buy a video camera.  All in ones tend to not have top notch videos. Those that are good, are snippets, and not full blown videos.2.  READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, FOLKS!  Lighting issues (incandescent, florescent, etc.) are taken care of in all high end cameras by changing the lighting source.  Problem solved.3.  For the price and features, this is a top notch buy. I hughly recommend. I have a Nikon D80 SLR and lugging it around is a chore, unless I am going out to do some local shooting. Vacations? Too heavy, nothing screams \"tourist\" like a large SLR!

Ante up a few more hundred and get one of the top names - Nikon, Canon, etc.  This is above the small point and shoots and below the full blown, large, cumbersome, SLR's!And, I agree with one reviewer about people who complain about every thing in a product. Too many valid complaints, the manufacturer will soon know them, and the product won't sell.  The price and features are outstanding.

Way more than I expected", "Author": "Nikwax", "ReviewID": "R33X11DIMKZKB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My background: I bought my first SLR camera in 1966 (for $90, a handsome sum at that time), before that my cameras were whatever I could get my hands on. I did a fair amount of darkroom work and still have my darkroom equipment in the basement. I've owned a series of Canon SLR cameras, and switched to a Minolta DLSR several years ago. I love my Minolta, I chose it over Canon and Nikon gear because I liked the way it feels and operates: it handles like a traditional film camera and less like a computer. I like dials rather than joysticks and multi-layered menus. And it is a tank: my outfit takes up a good sized backpack and it is quite heavy, and rough handling has landed it in the shop twice. So of course, I've needed a small camera to carry around. In the past we've had Canon A series compact cameras, which have had impressive features and take very good pictures, but the last two we had were very unreliable and we ended up giving them away. I do mostly nature photography, some of which is macro work, though I have done some portrait work as well.I've spent a good deal of time and thought searching for my current small camera. I want good build quality and good feel in the hand (the last being very subjective, of course). I want manual and semi-manual controls (aperture/shutter priority modes), I need a good macro mode, and I need exposure compensation to handle tricky backlit subjects. I looked at some fairly expensive cameras (e.g., Canon S90 and G11, which even at $400 and $500 respectively have their faults). And being unwilling to spend nearly $1000 on a 4/3 camera (which are impressive but still have their issues), I decided to see what an inexpensive camera could do. A friend has a earlier version of the S1500 and she takes very impressive nature photos. Much of my shooting is nature photos, and I loved the form factor of the S1500, so I thought I'd take a chance on it and ordered from Adorama through Amazon.I'm only a few hours into my S1500 experience, but so far I'm very impressed with this camera. The manual control that I want is there. Autofocus functions pretty much the same as it does on my Minolta, and I was pleased to find several autofocus options. I love the hand grip and the big dial on top. The contents of the display are great, I love the histogram, EV, and exposure info. I just took a panorama shot and the assistant works very well. Changing the ISO setting is very convenient. Everything I want to do is right there at hand, I don't need to drill down through menus to find things. I have large hands and don't like small fiddly controls. I like having a lens cap, as the external shutters that many cameras have are a typical point of failure in my experience. The electronic viewfinder is a pleasant surprise and easily turned on and off (same button as the LCD display).  The manual is very good. I didn't test the included software, but the S1500 worked perfectly with my Mac and iPhoto.Add ons: two sets of high capacity (2500mAh or so) rechargeable AA Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries and charger (Sony has a nice setup). Some sort of carry case (I'm using a hip bag). A media card (I picked up a 4 GB card for under $15).One thing I would like to see in a small camera is some sort of manual focus that works. The S1500 lacks manual focus, but it does have AF lock, so you can focus on something the same distance as your subject, lock the focus, and then take your picture. This is actually faster and more reliable than some manual focusing systems. AF is difficult even for expensive cameras, so don't expect miracles.Unless you are paying top dollar for a camera (we're talking four figures), there are always some compromises in the design. The manufacturer puts their money into some things and puts less into other things. My wife owns a really nice Panasonic travel zoom. Wow, what a lens on that thing! An amazing lens and a lot of automation, perfect for her, but not for me, no manual control. With the S1500, I'd say this is a camera that can keep an advanced photographer happy and impressed by the value. It is not a compact camera, as the lens and handgrip are prominent, and not lightweight (thanks to 4 AA batteries). I have no idea how a beginning photographer would respond to this camera, but I would say that if you want to learn about the photography, this could be an excellent camera.General comments: all cameras, film and digital, are limited in low light situations. Film behaves badly when it reaches its limits (grain, false color, etc), and digital sensors behave badly as well (pixelation, false color, etc.). Turning the ISO setting higher on a digital camera only amplifies the information coming from the sensor, and as small cameras have tiny sensors, turning up the ISO setting will degrade the image markedly. Don't be surprised when pictures taken at ISO 400 or above have image defects. This situation is made much worse by high megapixel designs: asking for more information out of the same sensor size equals degraded images. A 12 megapixel compact camera has the same size sensor as a 10 or 8 or 6 megapixel camera. Marketing departments would have us believe that more pixels equals better pictures, but the opposite is more likely to be true (note that manufacturers are lowering pixel counts now).  A larger sensor is the only solution to better low light performance, which means a larger and more expensive camera.I'm very excited by this camera and looking forward to working with the S1500.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "It would not work", "Author": "Kyra Storm", "ReviewID": "R775FEUMUJKOB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a Fuji S700 camera and I LOVED it.  I took it everywhere, I wound up taking over 6000 pictures in a year and a half.  I wanted to upgrade it for the S1500 because I wanted a better optical zoom.The features of the S1500 were very nice and I took almost 300 pictures the first week I had it.  I downloaded the pictures onto my computer the same way I did with my S700.  No difference.Then came the problems.  The next time I tried to take pictures I got a \"Write Error\" message.  I tried to download the pictures I had already taken, but they wouldn't download.  When I tried to play them on the camera I got a \"?Read Error\" message (supposedly with the question mark in front it means a camera error).  I thought maybe the memory card was bad, so I went and bought another one.  The same thing happened.I tried all sorts of trouble shooting.  I formatted the card before taking pictures.  I only used the FinePix Viewer to download the pictures and made sure to disconnect the camera with that program.It kept happening.I called Fuji.  No one ever answered.  The phone rang and rang and rang and rang.  I finally figured my camera was defective.  I sent it back to Amazon and they sent me another (really loving their returns dept).To be safe, I went and bought another new memory card, because in the manual it said that disconnecting the camera before it was time or trying to download to large of a file may hurt the card.  I also noticed that the manual said large memory cards may not be able to be read by the camera and they suggested using a memory card reader.  This advice was backed up on several forums I found where other people had similar problems.So I bought a memory card reader too.First batch, no problems, came out beautifully.Second batch...SAME THING!!! The pictures won't download.  This time, I even tried 3 different computers with my new memory card reader and card.  Same thing over and over again.I once again tried to call Sony with no luck.Now that I have 2 8GB memory card, 1 4GB memory card and a memory card reader, I have almost as much money invested to have bought another camera.  I have sent this camera back to Amazon again and asked for a refund.Due to Fuji's terrible customer service I have to say I will not recommend a Fuji camera to anyone ever again.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price.", "Author": "P.

How could I resist? Anyway, it is several steps up from the s700 model. 10 megapixels, 12 power optical zoom, a really rapid high-speed shooting feature, good quality video capture, long battery life and high quality photos make this a no-brainer. The down side is that you are limited to a low-range of aperture settings (you CAN'T set your aperture at f16 for example) in any of the \"manual\" or \"aperture/shutter\" modes. This prevents you from getting extreme depth-of-field shots. The panorama mode is great. Very easy to use for great, super-wide shots. This camera, unlike the s700, cannot use add-on filters or attachments because of the un-threaded lens. I went back to my s700 to be able to use polarizers, a lens hood, etc., (46mm threads on the s700). The ability to use high-capacity cards is not a reason to purchase this camera unless you want to keep an un-manageable number in the memory. I find that a 2 gig card holds MORE than enough shots at the top-quality setting for my purposes. Video does not link each clip together, but keeps them as separate images. You must, therefore, review them one at a time. But, this is not a primary video machine, just a high-featured digital still camera that can also shoot video (like virtually all others on the market). I prefer shooting thru the viewfinder, but the lack of a diopter adjustment requires that I use reading glasses to see the image properly. All-in-all, this is a fine piece of equipment for all but the most demanding user. It will do everything a camera should do, and give you the option of many entertaining (but not essentially practical) features to play around with. Keep your ASA settings on AUTO400 or lower for best quality and set your sharpness setting on \"hard\", because the normal setting is a little soft. The \"hard\" setting is not too sharp (on my camera at least) but check out your images to make sure. It's a great point and shoot with the ability to do professional work as your skills develop. Oh, Fuji, PLEASE include a FULL manual and stop with the downloadable one! If you're not near your computer and you need to review an advanced function, you're lost! Anyway, after doing a lot of research, I have NOT found a camera that can compare to this one feature-for-feature at even twice the price!

The camera came, I loaded the 8GB SD card I purchased and the alkaline batteries that came with it.* The first photo of my daughter indicated the goodness of the flash and the great pictures this camera could take* Camera grip is great. I felt that the build is solid.* For all simple features, this camera is easy to use. The button positions make it easy to configure the most frequently used (by me) functions/features.* It would have been nice if a camera bag was included. None of my digicam bags take this camera. I have to buy a new one !* The camera came with 4 Panasonic alkaline batteries. I've already taken 180+ pictures using the electronic view finder; the batteries are still going strong.* The EVF is good. At higher zooms EVF view appears to be noisy. However, the photos look good.* Looks like the image stabilization is working - never seen a blurred picture due to camera shake :)", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "WoW It Works !", "Author": "B.

Compared to other offerings from the big names, this camera has a big sensor and glass lense for clear photos, all of the manual options in addition to the automatic ones, and it is a nice size. I though that I would miss the rechargeable battery of my old Nikon, but in reality, I don't miss the tyranny of the rechargeable battery. I always had to plug it in the second that I was done with it, and if I forgot then it was dead the next time that I wanted to use it.The LCD is big and bright. I have the image quality set to max and I out in a 12GB card. The pictures are 5mb each, but they transfer very quickly to my MacBook - if there are only a couple I have to check to see if it worked because they are done so fast. I can't get over how well this camera takes photos. There are a lot more features than I realized, too. It is good to read the book when you get the camera. I really like that the flash doesn't automatically pop up if it is dark. The Nikon flash would pop up and I would have to manually change the flash mode to off if I wanted natural light. This camera informs you that your photos might be blurry because it is going to have to step the shutter speed down so much, but you get to pick if you want the flash. If you do, you just push a little button to pop it up. If you don't, you just shoot the photo. Great.

Being disabled now I could no longer afford or handle a DSLR.  I bought the S1500 as it has all the bells & whistles of other much more expensive super zoom cameras.  It's 10 mp, 12 X zoom, manual shutter/aperture control, macro and super macro modes were all features I wanted.  I was a Fuji fan already as I had taken many many photos of my son's first 5 years with a Fuji point & shoot with great results.  I have taken several dozen  photos with the S1500 and have been very happy with the results.  It is a solid well built camera and all though I am now used to using a viewing screen it is nice to have the option of looking through the viewfinder. Other than manual focus there is very little I would hope for, especially at this price.  I also want to share my buying experience with Amazon.  When my camera arrived I could not get it to work properly.  After 2 calls to Fuji they said it was a software problem and that I should return it to Amazon.  I have bought many things from Amazon but never had to return anything.  Being a bit old school I much prefer to handle these things over the phone with a fellow human being rather than by e-mail.  It took just a bit of looking to find the customer service phone number and make the call.  A mechanical voice informed me that I would receive an immediate call back which seemed a tall order.  Sure enough, within 10 seconds a customer service rep called and in less than 5 minutes I had a return shipping label and a new camera shipped and set to arrive in 72 hours.  The rep could not have been any better.  He was apologetic, professional and really made a wonderful effort to get the problem resolved quickly, which it was.

The camera will change from the view screen on the back of the camera to a view window with the touch of a button that works great in bright light when it is hard to see the larger screen. The camera takes high quality photos but you have to allow the camera time to focus by pushing the button down part way briefly or you will get blurry pictures. The camera is bulkier in size the the standard point and shoot. You can't slip it into your pocket. I bought a small camera case with a neck strap. The required lense cap is a slight inconvenience, but after a while seems pretty insignificant. The flash is very bright, and I've found that I need to be 10 feet or more away from the subject when I use it or it brightens things too much. Battery life is exceptional, but it does take 4 AA. The pixview software that comes with the camera is ok, but I liked my HP software more.

I absolutely love the photo quality, the ease of use, the functionality and ergonomics, and the many features packed into the camera.  I also miss having a solid lens where i could attach my many various filters...I would recommend this camera, or any of the Fuji line of finepix, to virtually any amateur photographer. They are all very simple to set up and use. it takes less than five minutes from opening the camera to having batteries and an sd card installed, and the settings adjusted. then the fun begins. These cameras are perfect for the amateur photographer, the hobbyist, the vacationers, and almost everyone in between.  Even some professional/semi pro photographers would make great use of them: my mother(semi professional photographer), and her husband(a photography instructor) both have used the s700 and have some truly amazing pieces.  With a multitude of functions, including an option to take panoramic shots (you take 3 consecutive photos, and the camera does its best to merge them side to side to side...), you will most likely fall in love with this camera. It is about the size of a standard 35mm, so not recommended for a jeans pocket, but still not so large as to be generally cumbersome.  The zoom on this camera is fantastic, I use mine primarily for long distance landscape shots, and they all turn out surprisingly well.  If you are looking for closer pictures, the macro and super macro settings work equally impressively. The only thing I've found that these cameras are not top notch on is high speed shooting~they do lag a bit more than some of the competition! If you are looking for great action shots, I'd recommend a Nikon or similar.My only complaints about this camera, and they all stem from owning the s700 previously, are  the removal of some of the photo settings(the fireworks setting on the s700 was one of the best I've ever come across!), and the switch from a solid external lens to a telescoping lens.  The former of these two would not have taken much to include in the software on the camera, and the latter has multiple drawbacks for me. I personally prefer a solid external lens for a plethora of reasons that most people won't think twice about. A telescoping lens is definitely more practical in terms of storage size, but I'm more concerns with the risks of getting dust inside the mechanics, and I will greatly miss being able to simply screw on a polarized lens, a colored filter, or the option of adding a telephoto lenses.All said and done, so far this is a good camera, and i do intend to continue using the Fuji Finepix line of cameras for many years to come.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good for pics, video a lil flawed", "Author": "thebrotherofasis", "ReviewID": "R1D0EQX3Z2PISL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera takes great pictures.

(When I say \"crossover\", I mean that it is not really a DSLR camera but it has numerous features found on, and produces pictures as good as, many of the entry-level DSLR cameras.)  At 10mp, it gives you as much detail as you will ever need for everyday pictures.  The LCD screen on the back is big, and works well even in sunlight.  You can also use the viewfinder if the sun is so bright that the LCD is not usable, which is an option you won't find in many of the pocket digital cameras these days.  The image stabilization is fantastic, especially if you find yourself shooting most of your pictures freehand as I do.The shooting modes give you a lot of flexibility.  The auto mode will do everything for you...all you need to do is focus and shoot.  Now there is not really a \"focus\" per-se, but when you find the center of your shot and hold the shutter button halfway down, it allows the camera to perfectly adjust and lock-in the autofocus before you click down the shutter button to execute the picture.  There is also a panoramic mode, a movie mode, a fully manual mode, as well as other pre-programmed modes.The zoom on this camera is excellent.  It allows you to get great close-ups when you are fairly far away from your subject.  I have found it to be excellent when shooting sports pictures from the sidelines, allowing me to get close enough to see facial expressions of the players on the field.Although the camera does come with software that will assist you in downloading the pictures from the camera to your computer, I have found it is much easier to just pop out the SD card and have my computer read the SD card directly.  This brings up what I consider to be the only shortcoming of this camera, which is the battery placement.  The SD card slot and the battery compartment, in the same location, are under a small access door on the bottom of the camera.  To get at the SD card or the batteries, you will need to have a flat stable surface to set the camera onto.  That being said, it's not that big a deal.  I have changed the batteries twice in the field, and if you have everything at hand (or if you have someone that will lend you a hand for a moment) you can change the batteries without setting the camera down.  It's just a little awkward.Overall this is a superb camera.  For the price I do not believe you will find a better camera.  To get better pictures and more features, you would have to jump to a true DSLR.  A note about the S1500's replacement, the S1800...the S1800 is due out in a few weeks, and it may be worth the wait.  The S1800 will cost about $50 more than the S1500, but you will get a lot of bang for that $50.  Better zoom, larger LCD, 12mp instead of 10mp, 720p HD movie capture, as well as many more new features.

The major problem with all of them was how and where they worked. Some took fabulous day shots, but now so good at night. Others took good day shots and would have taken good night shots except the flash washed everything out.SO we opted for a Optical zoom, and a big objective lens, for the light gathering. indoors under normal lighting the flash is not necessary for most things.As a camera it fits nicely in between the DSLR and the pocket point and shoots. Price wise it fits nicely in the pocket point and shoot range where most of it's competition is closer to the DSLR's. The only thing that comes close is the Nikon, and Nikon cheaped out on the lensing and made up for it in the software.The only two complaints I have with it are:1. having to read the manual. You can take good pictures without having done so, but if you read it you can take great pictures, there are allot of options and settings and it really matters that you pick the right mode for the shots you are taking.2. I wish Fuji would have allowed the attachment of some kind of filter. Attaching a UV filter for overcast days would have been a big boon or even a polarizer.

My budget was very tight ($200 or less), but I needed a camera with great macro abilities.  I do food blogging, so I also wanted one where I could fiddle with the white balance and other settings.  Obviously, finding that kind of flexibility in an inexpensive camera is rare.  Enter FujiFilm S1500!  This teeny tiny point-and-shoot camera is jam-packed with versatility.  There are lots of ways for you to manipulate your photos, but there are also lots of pre-fab settings--like if you're in a museum or outside in the snow.  I have used the 'museum' setting (which also eliminates all noises from the camera), and it worked great.So far, most of my shots come out pretty good.  If there's ample light, the shots come out beautifully.  Occasionally, I feel like the camera inexplicably takes poor photos, even if I'm on the right setting.  But you get what you pay for, right?  Other positives: The battery life is incredible, the macro and super-macro setting are really great, and shots are generally crisp.The negatives: For some reason, this camera is not recognized as an external device by my brand new Mac.

I accidently dropped it, and had to get a new one - finally, the price dropped right before Christmas. Features I love about this Fuji S1500:  It uses 4 AA batteries and will last a very long time.  The memory chip is in the battery compartment, easy to get out.  It has a 12x optical zoom.  It takes videos that are 640 x 480 lines, can play on a TV set, and with a $14 memory chip, can take over an hour of video.  It is even smaller than the previous model.  I don't use the software that comes with it, rather I load it into a new folder on my computer and work with it on my own software.  One of the negative reviews mentioned trouble getting the pictures off the camera with the FUJI software - I concur with that.The most useful feature is the eyepiece that you can look through - especially when glare prevents you from focusing the camera on the back LCD screen.  That eyepiece is improved on this model.

It takes a little experience to navigate all the features, and once in a while it is necessary to consult the owner's manual.Overall this is an excellent value, and since it uses four AA batteries, new batteries are no further away than the nearest convenience store.  This is a very strong advantage over cameras which used their own special batteries.After using this camera for several weeks, the only negative is that to remove the SD card, it is necessary to open the compartment where the batteries are located.  I've dumped the batteries on the floor a couple of times, a separate access for the SD card would be nice.  For this reason alone I would give it slightly less than a full five stars.Once you master the many functions available, the Fuji FinePix camera is a joy to use, it is inexpensive enough there is no worry about carrying it in challenging situations yet it produces excellent images for its price range.Since I purchased the Fuji FinePix at Amazon.com it is my camera of choice over the three other digitals available to me.

I was looking for an upgrade, and this FujiFilm FinePix S1500 camera was on sale for a great price. I use a camera often in my work -- photographing bands and street fashion -- but I am not a professional photographer so I was not ready for a digital SLR. It's also important to me to have a camera I can easily carry in my purse, and I don't want to deal with switching lenses.What I was looking for was:* improved picture quality from the CoolPix* flash for night/low light shots* portability* ease of useI am completely satisfied with all these aspects in regard to the Fuji FinePix. It's a larger camera body than I had before, but it's still portable. It's large enough to have a more professional look and actually mimics a digital SLR in body type. The camera has decent zoom and an optional flash. It can also take video, though I've not yet tried that feature. It requires 4 batteries, but they seem to last forever. I've taken a couple hundred pictures on one set of batteries so far. The flash works well in low light, though for photographing bands I kind of like the color-rich but slightly blurred effect of going without flash. Other photographers might not agree. At times, daylight pics seem a little washed out (a problem I've noticed in other cameras such digital has gone to more than 5 MP) but this can be edited a bit and probably changing the setting would help, too. As far as the ease of use, I was able to load the batteries, turn the camera on and start using it right away with no problems. It's very user friendly.While this camera probably wouldn't do for a professional photographer, it's great for an amateur and really you can't beat this bargain.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Compact and versatile", "Author": "J.

Before giving into my baser instincts and flinging the thing against a rock, I decided to return it and give up on Fuji cameras completely.  I say completely because the camera that died on me in the first place was a Fuji FinePix S1000, bought new less than two months ago.

It had all of the features I was looking for at a great price and good reviews to boot. The following is my observations and experience with this camera.I should state that while I intended to buy this camera from Amazon, I ended up spending a few extra bucks and buying it at my local Target so that I could have it immediately.First thing I noticed was the camera was a lot smaller than I expected. It wasn't all that much bigger than my 5 year old Sony Cybershot 5.1 mp that I was replacing. Not a bad thing, just different than I expected and someone might find useful. It fit really well in my hand and was very comfortable to hold. I could hang it around my neck and walk around comfortably without any feeling of pressure on my neck. All of the buttons worked well and the camera body seemed to be well made.After my initial observations, I briefly read through the manual that came in the box. I am not new to digital cameras so I was able to figure things out very quickly. The menus were easy to navigate and understand. I fired it up and began to test it out. I was extremely excited about the Super Macro mode so I tried that first. Everything was great and it was so easy! I was so excited. It took pictures of my fingerprints on my laptop buttons with perfect clarity and extreme detail! I was amazed! However, that amazement quickly took a nosedive.I started taking pictures of things around the house and my son using different basic automatic settings, flash on/off, etc. The scenes would switch fine in automatic mode and I had no problems with any of the settings. The pictures all seemed to turn out ok judging from the view in the LCD but I decided to wait until I uploaded them to my computer and really checked them out to make a true judgment.The night sky was beautiful and clear so I decided to test it outside with some pictures of the moon and other random things. As soon as I lifted the camera up and tilted it towards the moon, thin, horizontal purple lines appeared across the LCD. I snapped a few pictures and the same lines were in all of the pictures and they all turned out terribly. I was very careful with the camera and it was not jarred, dropped or anything that would suddenly cause the lines. I thought it was just a weird thing and went back inside to play around some more. The lines steadily got even worse. Now they were not only purple but white as well and they were in all of the pictures! If I tilted the camera up to take a picture of the ceiling fan, they were definitely worse. It happened in all the settings, with or without the flash, and wouldn't stop no matter what.I decided to put the camera up for the night and uploaded all of the pictures I had taken to my computer. I did not use the provided software so I cannot review that part. I just took out the memory card and popped it into my computer's card reader. Had no issues whatsoever with that aspect. As I looked over all of the pictures I had taken, I was extremely disappointed. The ONLY ones that came out even remotely good were the ones I took in Super Macro mode. They were actually very impressive (fingerprint photos I previously mentioned).  The pictures where I had used the zoom looked terrible and blurry.  All of the others were either just OK or terrible.  Overall, I was not impressed with the picture quality at all. They were very \"grainy\" and to be honest I think my cell phone takes better quality pictures. My old digital camera definitely took much better pictures and it was 5 years old and had a fraction of the megapixels, zoom and other settings.The next day, I tried out the camera again. Same weird, horizontal lines and crappy pictures no matter the setting, location, or light source. I boxed it up and off to Target I went. I returned the camera, opting for a refund instead of a replacement, because the picture quality was absolutely not up to the standard that it should be in my opinion. I'm not sure if I just got a lemon or what but I did not feel like going through the hassle again hoping I get a good one. The whole purpose of getting a new camera was for it to take better pictures than the one I was replacing and it certainly failed to do that even before the weird lines started, so I am moving on. I had very high hopes for this camera but unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.", "Date": "November 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the price!!!", "Author": "E.

Okey, it is a excellent camera for the money that you are paying, for this price you a lot of option that you can not find in other brands, for example, it have a panoranic pictures, and it reconstruction is so good, it has a menu only for fast shutter trigger, for example, you can take, in a rafage the 3 first or the 3 last of your shooting sequence, or you can take 6 fast shoots in 2 seconds at 5MP, or 15 pictures in about 4 seconds at 2 MP, or single 3 shoots in 1 second.also the zoom it is so good 12x you can take pictures with good range, and the AF, auto focus is good also.good cuality of the colors.Also you can take pictures, by controlling the shooter speed, by miliseconds until 8 seconds that allow take pictures at night and getting good pictures without a lot of light,  control the quantity of light that you want.,(but using a lot of shutter time you will need a tripod for this can of pictures).also you have a fast review of you are pictures.Finally, if you do not have the money to own a DSLR, i suggest you to buy this camera, is cheaper than other brands, but have the quality and the funtions like others one, i thing the for the name is not well know, it looks pretty good, and it is not too big or heavy.good choise. is my recomendation.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fuji s1500 camera", "Author": "Joan Wilmot", "ReviewID": "REXC77ZA345X5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Having owned Fuji gear in the past, we assumed this camera would last.

Don't waste your money!", "Author": "Joanne Bouthillier \"Joanne B\"", "ReviewID": "R1H4F21WPP0ALB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera back in December of 2009 from a local camera store, after a couple of months of using it I have three words... PIECE-OF-CRAP!!! Honestly I don't really know where to begin...Picture Quality (or lack a there of)For a 10 Megapixel camera, I found the picture quality to be pretty lousy. My 5 Megapixel Kodak point-and-shoot which I purchased a few years ago takes way sharper images. Overall I found a lot of the pictures that I took with this camera to be lackluster (dull, grainy) You would think that for a 10 Megapixel camera with 12 times optical zoom, the pictures should be unbelievably crisp and clear. Clearly not the case with this camera.Battery Life (again, or a lack there of)This thing goes thought batteries like mad, when using this camera it is a good idea to invest in some rechargeable batteries. The camera is also very picky about the batteries that you put in, if even one battery you put in becomes slightly weak, it will have a problem. There is no battery level indicator anywhere on this camera, the only thing that even comes close it a big red flashing battery icon in the middle of the screen, right before your camera stops working.Video Quality (once again, or a lack there of)The video on this camera is absolutely terrible, even in supposed \"High Res\" mode, it still looks pretty grainy. My 10 year old VHS video camera has better video quality. The audio is pretty bad as well; basically all you can hear is the sound of the lens loudly grinding in and out of focus, because for some reason the engineers at Fuji thought it would be cute for the video to have an \"Auto-focus\". For a 10 Megapixel camera, one would expect much better video quality.Bells and WhistlesDon't be fooled by all the bells and whistles that the seller mentions in the description of this product, let's face it, honestly only a couple you are really going to ever use.The manual that came with the camera was pretty lousy, all it said basically was how to hold the camera and where the button was to take a picture, and that's about it! Your are pretty much left to figure out everything on your own, and basically for the first couple of weeks all you pictures will be nothing but trial and error.Another thing that really bugs me about this camera is that even when the camera is in \"Manual\", I found that many times that camera will actually \"fight\" with you when you are trying to set a certain shutter speed and aperture setting. For example you change the shutter speed, and for some reason the camera (even thought it is in \"Manual\"), will change the aperture on you, messing up the built in light meter. Which can be really frustrating, especially when you need a specific shutter speed or aperture setting.The \"Auto-Focus\" on this thing is really, really, really annoying, sometimes you will be taking a picture of something, and have the camera all set up and in focus, then right when you take a picture, for some reason that's when the \"Auto-Focus\" kicks in and brings everything out of focus.The \"Auto mode\" is pretty ridiculous, I found the especially near sun-rise or sun-set the pictures for some reason come out over-exposed.ConclusionMy only advice is \"DONT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!\", you are much, much, much better off spending $100 or $200 more on something that you can actually take half decent pictures with. Personally I think Fuji should actually think for once what I photographer would want in a camera, instead of just what some group of engineers want in a camera.

We left for vacation on a Thursday nite, and by Monday morning the camera was dead.  We were at the Aquarium in Newport, Oregon.  I couldn't wait to take pictures.

The following statement is not my opinion but what I experienced with the Fuji digital camera S1500.The photographs have an over exposed washed out appearance. I read the manual and could not resolve the washed out exposure of the photos from this camera.When I make movies with this camera the audio sound is horrible.  It appears this camera has the volume level to record sound too high. The people speaking at a normal level the sound recored from this camera has lots of over volume static, like the recording level is set at 10 causing lots of distorsion, when it should be set at level 1.Fuji in the past has been a company that offered what was promised with their product.

It's a well made camera, and it had alot of good reviews. It has too many features for me. It's too complicated. I did like the panoramic feature and that was fairly easy to use. For some reason, all my pictures are turning out blurry since I have gotten the camera. I don't have the patience for it and neither do my kids. I took 50 or more pictures today of my children to try and get a nice picture for Christmas cards. I thought I had figured it out and would get a nice clear picture, but low and behold; Awesome pose of my kids, blurry picture again. I'm frustrated and disappointed. I finally have given up and I am buying a new camera and going to try and return this, but I just missed my cutoff date for returns so will probably have to accept a % of a refund. I hate this camera. If you can understand the features and have the time and patience to figure out how to just take a nice clear picture with it, then it's the camera for you.

When I got the camera I inserted the batteries and memory card and turned it on.  When the settings came up it was a little blurry but I thought it was just because of the light I was under; WRONG.  When I got to a picture mode the whole screen had a horrible purplish color to everything. the image was so out of focus I couldn't tell if I was looking at my husband or my cat. I tried to look through the EVF to see if it made a difference and it was the same story.  After several shots were taken, which all came up purple with huge black lines through it, I tried different settings.  I tried everything, even took it outside to see a different lighting.  Nothing changed.  I called Fujifilm and the tech support told me it was a bad sensor and to send it back.I tried to be hopeful that the good reviews would outweigh the bad reviews and the problems other people found were just one in a million.

Long", "ReviewID": "R2BCG962UZ00WK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I know very little about cameras, so I readily concede that all of my complaints may be due to my own ignorance.I wanted this camera for a very specific purpose.  I have a lot of microfilm and microfiche, which I am hoping to be able to selectively digitize (without paying for an expensive microfilm-to-digital machine).  I had read on the web that cameras with Super Macro Mode could be used for this purpose.  I have an old Olympus camera from 5 years ago which has Super Macro Mode, but it does not get closer than 3.5 inches.  This is satisfactory for some microfilm images (such as front pages of magazines) but the magnification is not strong enough to read text in newspaper microfilm, or microfiche.  The Fujifilm FinePix S1500 specs stated that its Super Macro Mode can be as close as .8in (that's over four times closer than my old camera, plus it has over twice the resolution).  So I hoped that the Fujifilm camera would greatly enable my ability to digitize my microfilm, perhaps by a factor of 9.  But unfortunately, those hopes have been dashed.To my major disappointment, images from this Fujifilm camera at the closest distance of .8in are not as close-up as my old camera at 3.5in.  (Obviously the Fujifilm camera uses a much wider angle.)  To make matters worse, the Fujifilm camera at closest Super Macro Mode has bad bulging away from the image's center, causing distortion in any photographic images from the microfilm I am trying to digitize.  I have uploaded a photo graph showing the extent of that bulging, which was totally absent in my old camera's Super Macro Mode.  The images taken with the Fujifilm camera do have sharper resolution, so by zooming into the saved image I can read microfilmed text a little clearer.  But it's not that much clearer, and nowhere nearly enough for my needs.  Small print on microfilm is still unreadable.So I'm rating the camera a 3, because I was so disappointed with it.  I assume it is still a good, solid general use camera, and if you don't want it for the special purpose of digitizing microfilm, you might be very satisfied with Fujifilm FinePix S1500.", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Camera software is brain dead and not Linux compatible", "Author": "kevin okane", "ReviewID": "R1IF5L02V7H2L2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera seems nice but cannot be used without Fuji's software which is mainly designed to get you to order prints from Fuji.
