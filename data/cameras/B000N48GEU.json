The first of these two is the S50.  Nice sized camera that easily fits a pocket or purse.  But here's what really makes it stand out:1) Good quality 3x optical periscoping lens with true VR.  The periscoping feature means the lens zooms inside the camera body, not outside.  This protects the lens from damage if dropped or accidently turned on while in a case (or restricted area like a purse or pocket).  The VR is of the optical shift variety, which is far superior to the \"anti-blur\" modes that simply boost the ISO.  But this camera can also go to ISO 1600, getting the best of both worlds;2) Large 3 inch screen you can see reasonably well at poor angels (such as when holding the camera at low angles or above your head), and better than average outside (at least well enough to take your photographs);3) Reasonably prices accessories. Nikon reasonable?  Yes.  Nikon is very reasonable on additional batteries and replacement items.  Additionally, they use the SD memory cards, the easiest to find and the most price competitive out there;4) Great in camera editing.  No, it's not a PC-in-a-camera, but it does allow the best in camera editing of any point-and-shoot digital.  The D-Lighting is particularly good as saving photos where the important areas are too dark without washing out the light areas.I also prefer the black finish of the S50 to the silver finish of the S50c.  The latter camera features a wireless capability that will not be useful to most, for about $50 more.", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Marvelous little critter", "Author": "Victor Eijkhout", "ReviewID": "R3C2AU39F5LLGG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My reason for buying this particular camera was the \"anti-shake\" image stabilization. Too many of my picture are, eh, taken during an earthquake, as the old joke goes. Well, the very first time that I gave this camera a road test, I found myself at the coast, wanting to take pictures with full zoom, while strong sea winds almost blew me off my feet. \"Captain, permission to engage image stabilization?\" \"Make it so, number one!\".And miraculously, none of my pictures were shaken or stirred. I love this thing.Another big plus is the big LCD on the back. It's big, it's gorgeous, and it makes you excited about your pictures while you're taking them. There is something psychological going on there, but the fact is that the LCD makes you fall in love with the camera and your own picture taking capability, even before you have seen the result.I'm giving this thing 4 stars instead of 5 because of two niggles. One: turning off the flash is confusing. Bizarrely, it seems you can not change flash settings when the anti-shake is engaged. Two: the lens is placed to the edge of the camera body, and I regularly find a finger of my left hand dangling in front of it. As a result I need to hold it in a somewhat unnaturally feeling way.But on the whole I'm very happy with this camera. And small and black it looks very sexy.", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "An awesome camera", "Author": "M. Ayars", "ReviewID": "RRU56Y5HGVVSG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my new S50 and left the next day on an extended trip. Having upgraded from a Coolpix 4300, I found the S50's picture quality stunning. The 3\" viewing screen is easy to use for framing shots as well as viewing the results in all except the strongest direct sunlight on it. The menu options, while extensive, are easy to understand for various shooting options, although I use the manual to understand the less-often-used features. While I miss the ability to use a viewfinder as well as the view screen for composing pictures, the 3\" display is so vivid and clear, and the camera such a convenient size, it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. The interface cable allows you to plug into a USB port or the video/audio ports of a TV. It and the battery charger fit nicely into my travel backpack. I have ordered a spare battery as the 3\" display uses some juice. I found I had to recharge the battery every night (I was shooting a lot of pictures and showing them off). I also recommend a slim case to prevent scratching the display screen. I put in a 2 Gb card and at fairly high resolution it looks like I can shoot 600 to 800 shots.This is a great product, it takes great, crystal clear pictures which crop and blow up well.", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Bought as a gift then had to get one myself.", "Author": "K. Chaffee", "ReviewID": "R3VJM6XZWXVW23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was generally happy with my Sony. So long as I was using it outside. I had issues using it in low light situations. I purchased this camera for my niece as a graduation gift. She let me play with it a little one evening. I took some pictures of my spastic boy in a low light setting. WOW! The pictures were as clear as they would have been had I taken them during the day with sunlight coming in the windows. And even though he was in constant motion, there was no motion blur. I did however have to press the button a little ahead of his actions, the red-eye flash caused the reaction to be a bit delayed, but my son is a ham and was always posing.THE GOOD* Small - I really like the idea of having a small pocket sized camera. I know that there are cameras that can take better quality pictures, but if it is a pain to carry around what good is quality when I miss a great shot all together? The cases sold for digital cameras are all too large, and don't pocket well. I suggest trying other options, I've used a memory card case for my Sony and for my niece I went to the office supply store and found it fit perfectly in a business card holder. This way the unit was protected and still fit in her pocket. The screen protector I applied seems to stay on pretty well.* Fantastic Low Light Pictures - I am still playing with the settings to see if I can get a faster reaction when I shoot.* My niece loves the black - And the finish does not attract fingerprints. I also found it in brown through ritz camera and red at circuit city.THE SO-SO* The red-eye is still there. I have never had much luck with the red-eye reducing flash on any camera, there is always red-eye when using it anyways. On this Nikon, however, I am finding it difficult to turn the red-eye flash off. The in-camera red-eye fix is not explained very well in the manual. I think it only works if it is in Portrait mode. The camera is supposed to automatically detect the red-eye and fix it. The manual does not explain if I need to tell the camera to look for the red-eye in a photo or if the camera just does it, in which case I wouldn't have known if red-eye was an issue in the photo or not. Personally, I would have like to see a before and after with the automatic red-eye detection.* Changing the settings is quite confusing and hard to remember how to do again. For some settings you have to go through a few menus. For other settings, such as the sports or fireworks programs, you need to make certain the camera is set in the scene mode first.THE BAD* I haven't found anything too terrible. I am pretty proficient with my editing software and so long as the picture is clear, I can fix most anything. The red-eye fix in my software works better than any point, click and auto-fix in most software.", "Date": "May 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Returned due to low picture quality", "Author": "Wayne M.

A large screen is a must, but it's very easy to get scratched up.  Tried using those aftermarking films, but finally tossed them because they kept pealing off of it when I put it back in the case.Macro is a great feature, although it would be nice to be able to zoom further for kids events.  The battery charger needs a timer to keep you from overcharging the battery.  Am not sure why this is not a built-in feature (a shutoff timer for the battery).  I did burn out the first one the first week on a business trip, but Nikon is great.

However, I decided that sometimes it would be nice to have a small, good quality, pocket size camera as a companion for the D70, especially in places where I did not really want to lug around a big camera like the D70; like boating and motorcycling and bad weather.So I bought a S50, and I am very happy with it, realizing it has some limitations.  I read the manual, and like most cameras, about 90% of the feature set is not important to me. I just get it out, adjust the zoom, and use it.  Picture quality is very good, ease of use is great.Three drawbacks, none of which is a showstopper:1. Battery life is very short.  You need some extra batteries.  Sorry, Amazon, but you can find some no name batteries on eBay for about $5 each, and they seem to work as well as the Nikon branded ones.  I recommend carrying two extras if you are planning a lot of photos especially if the flash is going to be used.2.  This camera does not have a docking unit like other small Nikons.  It has a large awkward cable for plugging into the USB port, a cable which is heavy and puts stress on the small proprietary plug on the bottom of the camera.  Also, you have to take the battery out to charge it, so you are removing and replacing the battery frequently.3.  Like most small digital cameras, taking outside flash pictures at night is a total waste of time.But I like this camera, and if I lost it, I would be tempted to buy another one just like it, even though there is some room for improvement.  Serves its function well as a backup, not serious camera.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good camera if you can avoid the white spots!", "Author": "Pai \"Pai\"", "ReviewID": "R137NHS14LJRJB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I already have an extended zoom Kodak Z612 so I was looking for a small pocket friendly camera for casual occasions. Did a lot of research and based on good experience with an S1 when I bought it for a friend over a year ago I decided to go with this stylish new S50, afterall the feature set is great!Nikon's legendary lens in a compact stylish all metal body and a birght beautiful 3\" LCD to boot, not to mention Optical/Electronic VR! I thought I'd finally found my match, so I thought.I had this camera for about a week and managed to shoot 280 pictures in three graduation ceremonies in varying light conditions.The camera really shined during daylight and dusk pictures! The \"Dusk\" scene mode beautifully captures the purple/red hues in the horizon. The \"Night Portrait\" outperformed my Kodak and captured beautiful skin tones. Overall pictures are softer than those of say, Canon PowerShot SD series but about the same detail level as Kodak Z612. Also, I found the Face Detection feature to work fine but sometimes it would hesitate as much as 2-3 seconds before detecting a face even when subject was looking straight in the lens.Shooting performance is a bit on the slow side but should satisfy most casual shooters. Auto Focus does hunt from time to time specially in low light which is common in compact cameras.What really put me off though was the 3rd. set of pictures I shot at a ceremony. They were full of varying levels of white spots all over them! I had once before experienced something like this with a Canon S400 a couple of years ago but that was nothing close to the problem on this camera. Mind you, it only happens when using flash and under specific circumstances which I have been unable to figure out.Contacted Nikon who were not really helpful and couldn't really explain it to me. So I did my own reasearch on the net and it appears its might be some light from the flash bouncing off the lens internally.Either way the slower than average performance had me on the fence already and ruining one of my most important set of pictures ever left me with a single choice, to take it back to BestBuy...I replaced it with the Sony DSC-T100, my first Sony digital camera in nearly 6 years which I have to say I'm delighted with. It has much faster performance, has a 5X zoom lens, has a more advanced Face Detection (Varies the AF, AE and the Flash intensity which S50 doesn't) and is a bit smaller than the Nikon. In defense of Nikon S50, it uses SD cards and has more scene modes.So if you are considering this camera, do buy it and try it! It might have been that my model was defective and the white spots issue isn't wide spread but if you are on the fence between this camera and the sony DSC-T100 don't even think about it twice, get the Sony.But overall I'd still recommend the S50 for specific reasons I already explained above and hopefully your model won't be defective like mine.", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not friendly for lightweight travelers", "Author": "W. Munro", "ReviewID": "RBU3I970O8OG7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For those of you looking to travel light, either for business or pleasure, there are a number of factors you should be aware of with the S50 that make it not nearly as travel friendly as other makers.1)Battery charger comes with long proprietary power cord that must be taken along for it to work.  Not only is this cord bulky (think laptop powercord without the brick), it adds lots of weight.  The battery charger and cord together weigh 5.7oz (compared to 2.0 oz for the Canon charger that plugs directly into the wall).2)Proprietary cable connection to camera.  Unlike most compact digitals that use the standard mini-USB connector to allow you to connect the camera to computers or printers, the S50 uses a proprietary connector, that requires you to carry the proprietary Nikon cable along with you.  Most folks these days have multiple electronic devices that use USB as the standard connection (e.g. iPod, blackberry, etc.), allowing you to carry just one cable to connect these devices to your computer.  The S50 will thus require you to carry its unique cable with you all the time.3)Combined computer/video cable.  Adding insult to #2 above, the actual cable (with the proprietary connector) is actually two sets of cables attached together ... the USB cable to connect to the computer ... and another set of video cables to connect to the tv.  This combined cable weighs 4.2oz (compared to 1.1oz for a normal standalone USB cable).  Unlike most other manufacturers that allow you to only carry the cable that you need (potentially no camera-specific cables at all, if you have other mini-USB devices), the Nikon forces you to carry this double cable all the time.", "Date": "May 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "More than pleased, overall", "Author": "Eduardo", "ReviewID": "R3HVMT6NU0QH2N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera had all the features I could possibly ask for, easy to use, great movie mode and quite fast. It does bridge the gap when I don't want to have to deal with my DSLR's clunkiness.

I know that this way they save some space but I really really really hate this decision. They could have also opted to include an adapter, but instead included a bulky cable that does video and USB. So you're stick with the A/V cables all around even when 99% of the time you only need the USB.Two small pieces of advice: Get another battery (something like 20 bucks, even for a brand one) and get a Treo horizontal belt leather case.

The s50 has a quick start up time and although I was reluctant to give up a viewfinder, viewing through the 3 inch LCD is not bad even outside.  In direct sunlight it needs to be shaded though.

I'm an enthusiastic owner of a D80, which I adore. So when I needed a small camera for travel, I thought this sleek Nikon would be just the thing. It looks beautiful, and it's so tiny that holding it almost makes you feel like a spy.But after using the camera for just three weeks, I returned it to the store. There's the annoying finger-in-the-frame tendency that other reviewers have mentioned: even though you know you need to compensate for that, a finger still winds up in the shot occasionally. There's also the fact that once you account for all the bulky wires and chargers and accoutrements, it's not such a small package after all. And the battery life was far too short. But most importantly, there's the picture quality. Though it is possible to get great shots with this camera, I got far too many that were grainy, and it didn't perform well in low light, either.I wish this had worked out - I love Nikon and I loved the way this camera looked and felt. I just felt I couldn't trust it with my once-in-a-lifetime travel photos. I suppose if someone were looking for a camera to snap party pictures or around-the-town shots, it could be a good choice.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "L.

I put a sample picture that was taken in vivid color and Fine mode. What should I have done is crop the pic and show you how watery, noisy and grainy the picture was. As someone mentioned, on the camera's screen it showed fine, once you download them to your PC and see them at full resolution, which I mean, the actual size, you will see no details at all. So if you want to take advantage of the 7.2 MP and want to print a poster of your baby, you will be greatly disappointed. The camera in itself is very elegant but the pictures are worthless. I am still searching for a compact camera to take everywhere, I already have a Nikon D50 which takes absolutely gorgeous pictures, I love my D50, too bad the S50 is in no means comparable to it.Well, back to the search for the perfect compact camera...", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Goooooood~~!!", "Author": "Lee Seungman", "ReviewID": "R28090Y069CADG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like itI bought camera at first time all my lifeI am satistify.
