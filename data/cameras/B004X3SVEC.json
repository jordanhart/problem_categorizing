THEY FINALLY GAVE ME MY RMA# ON DEC 12th AFTER E-MAILING AMAZON WHO ARBITRATE THE DISPUTES THANK GOD FOR THE HELP FROM AMAZON OR I WOULD HAVE RECIEVED NOTHING IN RETURN. WAREHOUSESELLERS SENDS OUT MERCHANDISE AND THEY DON'T CARE IF IT'S JUNK OR NOT AS LONG AS THEY GET THEIR MONEY. WELL, ON DEC.30th I RECIEVED MY MINI DVR AND THIS ONE ACTUALLY WORKED.

Took it out of the box and hear the sound like some part is broken or some screw is loose and moving around everywhere (chances of short circuiting). Buttons are cheep and you have to press them firmly still they miss some time.... Connected DVR with camera, it worked..... Tried to play recorded video but that was recorded in 3 - 5 seconds clips (Annoying). Sent an e-mail to seller (warehouseseller) asking if there is any way I can get more instructions because I wanted to get at least  15 - 30 minutes clips. They answerd NO, this DVR records 5 or 10 Seconds clips only..... What ????? Crazy ...... I would have never bought this DVR if I would have known this. This is one of the major factor in DVR performance but it is NOT MENTIONED anywhere in description on the website. Oh yes, only one channel is video clips, second channel takes only still pictures. I don't know if I would be able to use this .... Wasted money .....", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "SD card cant be read", "Author": "SEF", "ReviewID": "RPEHD0TE276G0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this last month....i waited until i got my cameras and sd card before testing it...finally got cameras and sd card...i put Sd card in the Sd card slot and it will not read it..smh!!..tried and still trying to contact seller..no reply cool...i will be calling the store tomorrow to exhale on someone!!", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$649.95", "Features": "2 CH Video Input Mini DVR, 2 channels of video input, 1 channel of video output\nRecording mode: motion detection, manually start or stop.
