I thought it was the best gift ever, so I started to record a whole bunch of videos. It never took good pictures either, it was always blur. After a year or so, this camera got ruined. I can't not even record videos, even when I take pictures I can't even see them because when I plug it in my laptop, it won't go through. Yes, the program is great, I play the games it has but, the point that I cannot even record videos or even take pictures, it's not worth it. I don't know if it will work for you, but, I just hope it does because mines didn't for me. Besides, I didn't even buy it in the first place, I got it as a a gift, so no money was wasted.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$39.99", "Features": "Digital camera stores up to 152 pictures.
