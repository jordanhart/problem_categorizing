I bought it thinking there was an 85% chance I was going to return it, but am happy to tell you that as soon as I uploaded my first pictures, I was smitten.  I was most worried about picture quality, because I had previously owned a Sony a200 and a700, and ended up selling both for a Canon and Nikon, because the picture quality just wasn't up to snuff.  My most recent camera was a D300s and I would say that the nex5 performs almost as well as it in most situations and even better in a few.  And the nex5 video blows the D300s out of the water!  Obviously everyone has different needs and preferences from their camera so all I can do is tell you what my needs were and why the nex5 is so great for them.The picture quality was the most important thing for me, which was more than adequate so the next most important criteria was the LCD.  The LCD on my D300s was a complete joke, as I couldn't see squat on that thing in even moderate sunlight.  This was extremely frustrating but since it was based on an OVF anyway, I just dealt with it.  But I started my photography in this digital age on a Canon S2IS which had a swivelling screen and full-time live-view, and honestly, I've missed that method of taking pictures ever since I moved up to dSLR's.  The two things that I wanted most out of the LCD on the nex5 were adequate visibility in bright sunlight, and real-time exposure compensation, so that you know EXACTLY what your picture would look like before you take it.  It passed both of these tests with flying colors.  The second day I had it, my wife and I went fishing on the river, in the afternoon sun.  Live view photography would have been impossible on my D300s but I had no problems with the nex5.  Understand that it will get a little washed out, but I was still able to compose as well as I needed and set exposure almost spot on.  When I got home and uploaded my pics, this was confirmed for me as they just looked amazing.  The best part about it was knowing that I wouldn't have gotten any of those shots with my D300s, simply because I wouldn't have brought the dang thing because I already had a bunch of stuff to carry.  The sony just fit in my pocket (cargo pocket, with 18-55) and was out of the way until needed.The other great things about this little guy are the ISO performance, which is ridiculous (better than D300s) and the high-speed continuous mode.  Just to be straight on this, it will take 7, full-resolution photos a second, but locks exposure and focus.  If you want it to refocus and adjust exposure, the best it can do is about 2 1/2.  Of course there's the panoramic mode (haven't tried it), HDR mode (don't like it), and twilight mode (don't like it).  Oh yeah, and I love the detachable flash which is solid as a rock when attached, but since I hardly ever do flash-photography, I love to be able to get it out of the way for the majority of the time.For me this is the best camera on the market right now.  I tested it against the Lumix G2 and thought the picture quality is noticeably better on the Sony (I do think focus is faster on the G2 though - certainly a great camera too), not to mention the form factor is so much smaller!  But, with all that said, I fully plan on selling it in the fall when the new batch of cameras come out because there are a few things that the nex5 doesn't have that I desperately want.First of all, the menu sucks.  There's no way around it - if you ever try to change the settings, you are going to be frustrated by it.  I could live with that, but there are other things missing.  As good as the LCD is, I really want an EVF, even if I have to have a slightly larger body.  I also really need just a few more buttons, namely: ISO, Focus lock, AE lock, but I do like the minimalist approach, because I absolutely hate the millions of buttons that Canon and Nikon throw on their cameras.  As I mentioned, the video is very good, and although it does have an exposure control, so you can increase or decrease the brightness by two stops at any time (kind of neat), I need full manual control over video.  The only other things that I don't really like are just nagging things that I could live with, but I'm hoping will improve in my next purchase, they are: battery life, screen blackout, and shutter noise.  Battery life goes really fast on this camera and spares are ridiculously priced at $70, but I can understand that it takes a lot of juice to run that screen, so I could live with it.  The screen does black out when you take pictures for what seems just a hair too long.  It's not terrible, and for a $700 camera it's actually very good, but it's just something that would bother me in the long run.  The shutter is surprisingly loud.  The first day I got it I took a picture of my wife taking a nap on the couch and it actually woke her up!  I'm not saying it sounds like a freight train, but unfortunately, I love taking incognito pictures in crowded places and would definitely have to be a little more careful with this little guy.So, all in all, this is my favorite camera I've ever owned.  I mention that I plan on selling it only because I know that the evolution will be to bring more and  more functions to this small sized, mirrorless style camera, otherwise I wouldn't.  If I had to choose between every camera out there right now, I'd choose this one every time.  But I'm keeping a keen eye out for the nex7 and gh2 that should be coming out this fall, and guess that one of those cameras will be pretty much perfect for me.UPDATENow that they've started manufacturing adapters for the NEX, I got myself a Canon FD lens adapter which has really taken the camera to a whole new level.  Understand that you will only have manual focus with any adapter but Sony makes it very easy by dedicating the bottom button to MF Assist which zooms in so you can make sure that your focus is sharp!  Even though some of the lenses dwarf the tiny little NEX, it still handles very comfortably and efficiently.  If you love this camera but are frustrated with the selection (or lack of) of lenses, check out the options on ebay - those old lenses are a real bargain now.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow! This is one great camera!", "Author": "Radio Man \"yarns13\"", "ReviewID": "R10RTASB20PDPF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the Olympus EP-1, Panasonic GF1, also have a Nikon d90 and canon s90 so I have seen a lot of pictures from all these cameras. First I would like to say the MENU on the NEX is actually pretty GOOD. Yes, like everybody has said it would have been nice to have a dedicated button for iso, w balance etc..BUT it takes literally 1 second and you can change those settings, what's all the fuss about??? I actually find the Nex's menu LESS complicated than the EP1 that drove ME nuts! So..to all afraid of this camera because so many reviews mention the menu is horrible..to them I say what???What is blowing me away most is the low noise at high iso plus the overall picture quality. I am one of those DSLR people who wants DSLR type quality in the smallest package possible. I admit I am NOT a pro photographer but I can change every setting on my D90 and I know how to go deep into DSLR settings and what they mean. I say this ONLY because the Nex-5 seems aimed at point and shooters moving up the quality ladder but supposedly don't know all that much about settings. Yes, the Panasonic GF1 and Olympus E-P1 seem to give you a \"little more\" manual control than this NEX-5 does..but it's pretty close..re: controls.What the NEX-5 does in my opinion is especially in raw format Blow the doors off the GF1 and EP1 as to how much detail you can work with. On the GF1 in raw..often I STILL couldn't get skin tones to look right, shadows in lower light always had too much noise..and I ended up with too many grainy pictures. I am simply blown away with the NEX as to how much detail you can get back using raw...where the jpg may look like a total loss..you can often still get a great pic using raw. For the point and shoot people..the raw conversion software that comes with the Sony is actually VERY good, powerful and EASY to use. Overall this is a SMALL camera that pretty much takes pictures in the same general ballpark as the better dslrs in my opinion. I think this may actually have less noise than my Nikon d90. What I don't like..manually you can only choose iso 200, 400, 800, 1600 etc. I prefer a bit more control ala the GF1 where you can choose say a 640, 1000, iso or 1200 iso etc. That being said if you choose Auto iso the NEX Will at times choose isos such as 640, 1000 etc..not available manually.Some of the gimmicks? like panorama or twilight handheld shooting where the NEX shoots about 5 pictures within about a second actually WORK and I think at times \"these can give you pictures you simply can NOT get on a gf1, ep1\" etc. One other thing I am not thrilled about is overall color saturation is bit too punchy or high. This is not a problem as it takes a sec IF you want a bit less color saturation in your pics with any photo editor.The NEX feels great in your hand. It feels solid as a brick YET seems to weigh much less than the gf1 and ep1 making the Nex easier to take with you!There is no perfect camera and never will be. In my opinion though..if you don't need to change settings every 2 seconds..OVERALL this NEX-5 may be your best choice right now as far as mirrorless cameras go. Don't forget one huge reason the GF1/EP1 look so much better than point and shoot cams is the sensor size. Well the full sized dslr sensor in the NEX is MUCH bigger than micro Four..hence the lower noise...better overall IQ in my opinion.UPDATE: The menu system never really bothered me, however, after updating to latest version 03 this Nex-5 is even WAY WAY better. The menu system now is downright EXCELLENT in my opinion. I am constantly blown away by how great this LITTLE camera is. What a WONDERFUL camera overall!!!", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Absolutely fantastic camera!", "Author": "David Schnitt", "ReviewID": "R1IW4XXNOS5BVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera now for 3 weeks and its really wonderful overall.Pros- Very compact and light - not quite the size of a compact camera but pretty close.  With the 16mm lens you can easily slip it into a jacket pocket or carry it in a small case.  But it feels very substantial and has great ergonomics.  Carrying around a DSLR is such a pain when I am hiking or walking around a city but this is a piece of cake.  It also hangs from your neck with the lens pointed down so you don't bump into things with it.- Articulating screen lets you shoot from the hip (literally).  Screen is also super high resolution and what you see on the screen is pretty much what you get with the picture which is amazing for a non SLR camera.- Fantastic pictures - great colors, excellent quality, 14m pixels really produces clear pictures.  Great depth of field.  The same sensor as found in a much larger DSLR.  Rarely need to use the flash because the sensor is so good.- RAW support as well as JPEG- 1080 videos are beautiful and sounds quality is very good- All of the controls are just a few clicks away on the interface to change the ISO, aperture, etc.- Some really neat features such as HDR (takes 3 pictures with varying settings automatically to develop pictures with more contrast and shadows), automatically takes a picture when someone smiles (really!), panoramic pictures with ease (although takes some practice)Cons- Battery life is lousy.  I may have a bad battery and I called Sony and they are sending me a new one for free.- RAW files currently cant be viewed by iPhoto, Photoshop, etc. but you can view them using Sony's software.  This should change in the near future.- Limited lens selection right now - again this should change- Most of the software that comes with the camera is PC-only (including firmware updates!) and not available for the Mac (but the key programs that do come with it are mac compatible)All in all, I am very glad I made this purchase.  I wanted a new DSLR but was tired of carrying around such a heavy piece of equipment.  This is probably a great second camera for professional photographers but for everyone else its just a really great camera.  Its ideal for people that want better quality than they can get from a compact but don't want all of the downsides of a DSLR.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "A mixed bag of blessings", "Author": "Hengyi Hu", "ReviewID": "R3OMXVNYVCMM9X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've shot with both DSLRs and rangefinders for the past 7 years, and I bought this hoping that it would be an easier camera to carry around when I just need to snap a few quick pictures. I've read generally positive reviews and thought I'd give it a try.It's been a mixed bag from three days of shooting. The camera itself is not meant to be a replacement for a DSLR, or a point and shoot, or a rangefinder. It is not as fast as a DSLR, not nearly small enough to put in your pocket (although the 16mm lens might let you do it), and does not give you manual freedom or \"connectedness\" like a rangefinder.The tactile feedback is very limited, and yes, the menu diving is annoying. The options in the menu are inconsistent depending on which camera mode you're on, and some options (like raw shooting) are absent when shooting certain modes like hand-held twilight, panorama, etc. I suppose this makes sense in terms of processing, however the camera doesn't explain that you need to be in another mode first in order to change these settings.The video quality is fairly good. You have almost no control of the recording, however. Everything is automatic - you can tap the shutter to \"refocus\" the camera, but to me this just sends the camera on a wild AF hunt that blurs the video. The intelligent auto also works well for someone who just wants the camera to do all the work. The other modes, panorama, twilight, and the preset \"styles\" all work pretty good. Saves me the time of stitching pictures together!The raw files from this camera are decent - but never on par with my a700, and certainly not on par with my m8 or m9. Most of this is due to the lens, I believe. The kit lens is very prone to all sorts of distortion, and never takes pictures that are exceptionally sharp. And another issue with the raw files is that they're incompatible with photo editing software currently available. (Doesn't work in LR3, Aperture, photoshop, etc) They can only be viewed on sony's software. Eventually the format will be added, but for now you're stuck with sony's proprietary software unless you want to convert these files to adobe DNG.With all of that said, for $700 you do get value for what you pay for. The camera does take pictures that are far superior to any prosumer point and shoot, and slightly edges out my friend's panasonic GF1. The video is pretty nice for such a tiny camera, and toting it around is a lot easier than carrying a DSLR or a rangefinder. I really liked the tilt screen that reminded me of my old hasselblad. I can recommend this camera if you're looking for an upgrade to your point and shoot, but I can't recommend it as a replacement for a normal DSLR or rangefinder. The tactile feedback, speed, and manual controls simply aren't there.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Novice First Time with a Nice Camera with a baby too!", "Author": "Sebass", "ReviewID": "R222JFEILOLPS4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I figured I'd share my thoughts for the vast majority of people who most likely purchase some things like I do.  We have a 10-month old and my wife and I wanted a camera that would allow us to take awesome pictures.  DSLRs were too big to lug around and after reading the specs and seeing the Olympus and Panasonic I decided to hold off until this Sony came out.  Very happy that we did.  This camera makes you feel like a professional photographer.  Don't worry about trying to get that one shot, I just hold the button down and grab tons of photos hoping to get the kid posed with the right facial expressions.  We've taken it to the beach, outside in the yard, in the house, etc. and the photos are stunning.Then there is the absolutely undeniable \"coolness factor\" of having this camera in your hand as you are snapping photos.  It is so small compared to anything else that you are just amazed as to how it feels perfect in your hands.  I held the NEX-3 and it's garbage compared to this one.  It's not just the difference in movie quality, the NEX-5 has superior quality to the NEX-3 when you play around with them.  They shouldn't even sell the NEX-3 when you compare how much worse it feels in your hand.  You still hold the lens like a professional would and I love the LCD compared to a viewfinder.  Since you can bend it all over the place even in crazy light you can still see the image.  Cannot wait to take this on vacation.The videos are breathtaking.  Yes they are amazing.  The camera does it's best job trying to auto-focus and there is an occasional time where the video might go out of focus, but even with manually zooming in and out the quality and focus seem to stay extremely well.  Keep in mind that since the LCD is your viewing option you may notice your breathing over the audio of the video depending on how you hold it.  Didn't bother me though once I corrected for it.Don't open the box and just expect to start taking amazing photos if you've never had a camera like this before.  But it doesn't take long to get adjusted and make your wife wonder why you ever wasted money on a professional photographer.  It'll pay for itself within a few years.As far as I am concerned the target audience for this camera is families or individuals who are sick of crappy photos with a point and shoot.  If you want to be a camera snob and dissect the features it has or doesn't has, that's your choice.  But I'll never use half the stuff on here and if I do figure it all out, then I'll probably be obsessed with a really nice DSLR and photography as a whole.  But I'll always love this camera.The panoramic mode is really nice too and this camera has taken it from gimmick feature to legitimate.  Haven't had a chance to play with 3D yet but that's a gimmick right now and I really could care less.If you want a small, really cool, well built camera that takes unbelievably awesome pictures and 1080p video...buy the NEX-5!", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wait for the NEX NEX", "Author": "GJW", "ReviewID": "R3DAJS88RDST5G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Years ago I was a serious amateur photographer using the best SLR gear available.  I've been point-and-shoot for the last decade, largely because professional quality DSLRs were quite expensive and too big & heavy to take along on hikes and trips.  The Sony NEX5 enticed me to upgrade from my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ5 (a very good point and shoot).  Based on the specs and the initial reviews, the NEX5 seemed to have everything I wanted and needed: small size and weight, interchangeable lenses including lenses from other cameras with adapters, manual control of aperture/ISO/shutter speed when desired as well as sophisticated automatic controls, big CMOS sensor, reasonable price, and SONY reputation for quality.  HD video is a nice feature as well.I've used the camera for the last month.  If I had it to do all over again I would wait for the next version or the next offerings from other companies.  It isn't that I don't like the camera  -- it is fun and I'm still likely to string it around my neck when I go out for walk.  But it falls short of what I want in several areas:1) No viewfinder.  The LCD display is big and bright, but if you're outdoors with a bright sun on the display you simply cannot see what you're shooting.  If you're in automatic mode, you can shoot a bunch of shots and probably will find what you want somewhere in there, but if you're making any manual adjustments or using a lens from another camera, forget it.  For me this is a fatal flaw.2) Useability with other lenses.  I have a large collection of high quality Pentax k-mount lenses from my serious amateur phase.  How great, I thought, to be able to mount these on the NEX -- I'll have great glass and I won't need to buy more lenses.  So I bought a K to NEX adapter (about $25 on eBay).  I knew would have to manually focus my old lenses on the NEX body, but I had to manually focus them when they were on my Pentax film camera, so I thought that would be fine.  In fact, this works well with a short lens and a stationary object.  Thus with a 55mm f1.4 Pentax lens and flowers as the subject, I can get some wonderful pictures with the NEX.  But I'm mostly a wildlife and landscape photographer where a longer lens is necessary.  Slap a 200mm telephoto lens or a big zoom on the NEX and you've got problems of two types.  First there is blur because SONY builds its image stabilization system into the lens rather than into the NEX body.  So with a 3rd party long lens there is no compensation for hand shake, and your hand will shake with a long lens.  Second, you have to manually focus using the LCD display, but see my first point.  The only way the NEX will work well with a long lens from another camera system is if you use a tripod, have a stationary subject, and can shield the LCD display from bright sun.  This means that if you want to use your NEX for anything that requires a lot of magnification, e.g., sports, birds, many types of landscape, you'll have to pay $800 for the NEX 18-200mm zoom, which isn't available anyhow.  When you add $800 for a usable long zoom lens to $700 for the NEX5 kit, you've moved into a price point where you may be better off buying a Pentax or Canon system camera where used lenses and 3rd party lenses are readily available.3) Menu system.  Yes, Sony has improved the menu system with a firmware upgrade, but you still have to click your way through menus on the LCD screen to set anything manually, whereas on other digital SLRs and many high end point-and-shoots there are buttons on the camera body devoted to particular functions.  This is a killer on the NEX because there isn't a viewfinder.  So you've got a nice shot composed on the LCD screen of the NEX and you would like to increase the exposure -- stop, open the menu system on the LCD screen, switch to aperture priority mode, recompose your picture if your subject is still there, stop again, adjust the aperture using the dial on the NEX body and get the readout on the LCD screen, recompose your picture and if the subject is still there: shoot.  On a SLR digital camera with a viewfinder and a dedicated button for aperture control you would compose the picture, adjust the aperture with your thumb, and shoot.  The menu system won't get in the way of your use of the NEX if you're going to use it only in automatic mode.  But if you want to treat it like a real DSLR, forget it.4) Service.  The battery charger that came with my NEX-5 kit, died after the first use.  I've spent maybe 3 hours on the phone with various SONY support people and after nearly a month of waiting have been promised that a replacement unit is in the mail to me.  Here is a more or less verbatim version of one of my interactions with SONY support:Me: I was told a week ago that a replacement was being mailed but I've check online with the order number I was given and can't find a record of it.SONY: We were having problems with our system a while back and maybe your order was lostMe: Then please place a new orderSONY: Okay, but I'm technical support.  You'll need to speak to customer support to get that done.Me: Can you transfer me.SONY: You'll have to phone them during regular business hours.Me: When are regular business hoursSONY: M-FMe: (It's Saturday morning). Given that you've lost my order and I'm sitting here with a new camera I can't use because the battery has run down, you'll have to do better than telling me to start over on Monday.  I would like to speak to a supervisor.SONY: I understand your concern.  It will be best if we move this up to the next level -- SONY customer relations.Me:  Great. Can you transfer me.SONY:  I can't because they're only open during regular business hours.I gave up and ordered a third party battery charger from Amazon that arrived in two days.The bottomline:  If you want the nicest and coolest point-and-shoot our there and don't need a lot of magnification for distant scenes or sports, buy the NEX.  You'll like it.  If you want a light DSLR for serious photography, wait until SONY or another company gets it right.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "ENGINEERING MARVEL IN MINITURIZATION", "Author": "T.

The result is a camera that's capable of producing pictures that rivals or even better than some of the DSLR cameras. I have the NEX-5 for over 4 weeks and am amazed what this little camera can do compare to my Nikon D300 DSLR.GOODS---Amazing picture quality for such a small camera; high dynamic range at base ISO, and low-noise at ISO-1600 and ISO-3200 (better than my Nikon D300)---Beautiful, pleasing, saturated color but not over the top.---Very good automatic white balance (better than my Nikon D300)---Large high resolution, super-sharp, tilting LCD screen (how SONY able to squeeze a tilting screen in a such small camera is beyond me)---HDR mode, sweep panorama mode (a sure crowd-pleaser), smile detection (gimmicky but great for taking kid's pictures)---1080P AVCHD high definition video with stereo sound---Sturdy, magnesium alloy body---Infrared port built-in allowing the NEX-5 to be controlled by a wireless remote (not an option for NEX-3)---Optional adapters available which allows you to use Nikon, Canon, or other SONY Alpha lens; however you must use manual focus and manual aperture control---Decent kit zoom lens (18-55mm, effective focal length 27-82mm); very sharp if you pick aperture close to 8.ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS---Menu interface, although easy to use, need to be streamlined (too many button pushing to change settings).

No flash hot-shoe on NEX3/5. No other options at this time although there are rumors that more power flash units are coming.---The focus speed, although pretty good, is slower than many DSLR including my D300. The NEX-5 is not the best choice for taking sport pictures due to focus speed and lack of good selection of large aperture zoom lens.---The auto-exposure is programmed to expose shadow areas which makes it prone to over-expose the bright areas. Use P mode with -1/3 exposure compensation if necessary.---The video can look grainy and noisy at night (or in very dark environment).---The battery life is lousy esp when taking picture outdoor during the day because when shooting outdoor, the LCD became much brighter to compensate for bright surrounding at the expense of the battery life.---HDR mode not available when shooting RAW---The shutter sound is LOUD and no way to quiet it down (hello SONY, what are you thinking?)---Need to use air-blower from time to time to clear out dust on sensor (a common issue among all interchangeable lens cameras)TIPIf you have a Mac, install Aperture 3 demo (free), then install Pro App update which then allows you to decode NEX3/5's RAW file in PREVIEW and also IPHOTO.ADDENDUM - V3 FIRMWARE UPDATE 10/14/2010V3 Firmware allow you to assign specific function to the center dial button and the help button which dramatically make the NEX3/5 more usable - Now I can easily access ISO / AUTO FOCUS AREA / METERING MODE / FLASH COMPENSATION / CREATIVE MODE / HDR with only a few clicks which greatly enhance the usability of both NEX5 and NEX3.

The photos it shoots are very impressive. The lenses, though currently limited in range, are very nice (I have them all.) I love the small, compact size, the progressive engineering and innovative technology. As a still camera, I think the NEX 5 is a thing of beauty....The problem is that they also promise that it shoots video - and it does - in short bursts that aren't too close together. The Sony spec states that you can shoot 29 minutes of video at a time. What they don't say is that the reason you can only shoot in limited amounts is because the camera is prone to overheating. They also don't tell you that to get 29 minutes of shooting time out of it you have to shoot in a refrigerator.I took it to a Mardi Gras Indian Jazz Funeral Second Line in New Orleans yesterday to try out the video feature. I chose this camera over my NEX VG10 because the NEX 5 is smaller, more discreet and easier to manage in a crowd. It's summer in New Orleans and about 100 degrees so I made sure I kept my shots short - under 5 minutes - and I tried to give the camera some cooling time in between shots. I thought my conscientious method of shooting would prevent the camera from even coming close to overheating, but I was so wrong. After about an hour of shooting on and off, the procession stalled and I found a perch on top of some stairs with a great vantage and waited in the direct sun for the procession to start up again. I had been waiting about 10 minutes with the camera on standby when the procession started rolling. I shot for about 6 minutes, getting the best footage I had gotten all day. I hit the record button to turn off the recording and I got a message that the camera had overheated. It lost my footage!I took the lens off so it would cool down faster and ran five blocks to get ahead of the procession again and to try to find another high vantage point. Finally I found a pick up truck and jumped up on the back bumper, reattached the lens and hoped for the best when I turned the camera back on. I shot for about three minutes, but the moment was lost - it was so hot that the crowd had dwindled considerably.I'm sure that under better conditions the results would be much better, but I would never try to push 29 minutes of video out of this camera - I'd be afraid it would melt the sensor! If you're considering this camera because you want a high quality still camera that you can also use for HD video, be forewarned that you'll have to manage your video shooting very carefully and it may crash in the middle of your video shot. I certainly wouldn't use it to shoot video for anything important.I would only consider it usable for video in optimum conditions - cool weather conditions or indoors - and only for very, very short bursts with plenty of cooling time in between with the lens off the body to help dissipate the heat.I've attached the video that I shot yesterday. The quality is very nice: good saturation, adequate auto white balance and decent audio if you buy the Sony ECMSST1 mic that fits on the smart shoe. Though the NEX lenses have image stabilization, for video it's minimal at best.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Big performance in a small package", "Author": "TK", "ReviewID": "R169PZC7KRZ7N7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After several months and a trip overseas, I love the Nex-5!I've shot at every level from pro to family fotog with hundreds of shots of the dog and kid. This camera does it all and IQ is much better than anyone has a right to expect at this price point. Yes, it is spendier than a point-and-shoot, but that is comparing it to the wrong end of the spectrum. It comes close -- indeed, very close -- to much higher-end cameras in performance and flexibility.I've shot for for news media and magazines, and still like to take a lot of shots on the street in a \"discreet\" manner. This camera works beautifully in that it is not intimidating. Unless, maybe, when you use the long tele which makes it look more like a lens with a camera attached.I use all three lenses available (the pancake 16, the 18-55 and the 18-200). The 35mm/full frame equivalents are 24, 24-82, 24-300.This is a pretty darned good starter set of lenses. I tend to prefer a wider range and would love to see a wide-angle zoom, say 10-20 (15-35mm). The 18-55 is lightweight and a good walking around lens. It's advertised for wide-angle through portraits. Most of my friends prefer a 105-135 film or full-frame equivalent for portraits. I liked 135 as it allowed a little more distance, which is often critical for discretion in candid situations. So I'd hope for an 18-70 or 18-90 down the road from Sony. There is no one lens that does it all, of course, but the 18-200 sure works its heart out trying. It's considerably more weight, however, and one loses the discretion factor a bit. My \"normal\" range for a tele that I like to shoot is 200 film equivalent. I got this lens figuring it would very sharp where I needed it, knowing most long zooms of this type tend to fade at the ends of their limits. But this lens is surprisingly sharp at both ends of the spectrum.The built-in image stabilization for the camera means all your lenses are stabilized. This system works splendidly. I am getting on in years, now, and not as stable myself as I once was, and I'm surprised that with this system I am able to shoot amazing low-light photos at speeds considerably slower than expected.Video? Ohyeah. Way better than I thought it would be. But I admit I don't buy a camera much for this feature. I also worked in Hollywood, so video is something I get very picky about. I'd rather use a dedicated video camera for anything in motion. And the video version of the Nex is also interesting for its ability to use interchangeable lenses at a price point that is surprising for cameras with this feature. I figure the idea of video in a casmera like this is so if something happens in front of you, you won't miss it and the end result will be of credible quality.Everything has advantages and disadvantages, and this camera is no exception.The Good:Very easy to carry all day.Stunning quality from a small package.Great autofocus capability.Great image stabilization.LCD screen highly adjustable and terrific for awkward situations.Choice of cards.Manual flexibility.Intelligent Auto surprisingly good.Incredible coolness factor.The Not-So-Good:Lenses are a bit slow.Menus kinda clunky and not always intuitive.Flash is good, but the mount is kinda flaky.Manual focus can be slow using adaptive lenses.The Bad:The strap that comes with it is not great.You can buy a replacement, but ain't nothin' cheap from Sony.It makes a lot of noise for a small camera.Accessories can add up. And you want to add stuff because this camera is so likable it becomes more like a pet than a camera.Well, I've not always had great luck with Sony service when it comes to computers. Actually, they're terrible. Not sure how they will be with their cameras, but so far their responsiveness is encouraging. They put out software updates very quickly and there is every indication that they are listening to consumer complaints and recommendations.Too often, folks search endlessly for the perfect camera for all situations. Stop looking. There is none. But this little jewel does a surprising number of things very very well, with the flexibility to meet many needs. Look at some of the serious discussion groups online and you'll find a lot of dedicated fans, including a surprising number of pros.Another point. There is little point in reviewing every camera as if it should be ready to shoot for National Geographic and Universal Studios right out of the box. With Sony, we have very interesting first offerings with revolutionary capabilities and technology in the Nex-5 and the recently released A55. For products right out of the gate, judging from user response, they could be considered home runs. As rookie products, they will certainly evolve within a year or so. Considering the pedigree and the performance of their rookie seasons, these two products are likely to evolve to become solid become superstars.As for the Nex-5 now?  I love it every time I reach for it, and I reach for it a lot.  I'd rank it Best in Class, but I think it created a new class by itself.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera with compromises", "Author": "Stan", "ReviewID": "R358Q0UY7CGZD0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually bought this camera from Wolf Camera (Big mistake as they charge a 15% restocking fee for returns)Pros:  Shoots almost DSLR quality photos, LCD screen is great, can shoot one handed with gloves, Low Light setting works well, panorama works fairly well with stationary scenesCons:  As of now the menu is cumbersome (software update may correct this)*.  Mine had random software crashes where I got a whitish purple screen of death.  this could be corrected by removing the battery and restarting.  This happened about 10 times over the course of about 400 pictures.  One time it crashed and wouldn't start up again for several hours.Summary:  As mentioned I ended up returning the camera and have not decided whether to get a new one or not.  It really needs an easily accessible focus lock and exposure lock.  The autofocus wanders in video mode.  Also the HD videos are not in a common format.  They will need to be converted for easy sharing. The kit lens is average in terms of sharpness.*\"Sony announced that a firmware update is coming mid october which will add fresh functionality to the Sony NEX-5/NEX-3. Autofocus operation is now supported when using A-mount SAM and SSM lenses with the optional LA-EA1 Mount Adaptor . There's also a new custom function that allows assignment to buttons of frequently-used functions. This allows you to set a wide range of functions (such as white balance, ISO, exposure mode, etc) to the center and lower-left buttons on the back of the camera. And the biggest addition has to be the ability to record movies with aperature control.\"", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Was very good - for a while", "Author": "snowhillguy", "ReviewID": "R1EI1JV5JFLON9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've been using high quality cameras for more than 45 years - made the transition from film to digital, photograph professionally - I have some creds here.Though totally in love with my Nikon F's (tens of thousands of exposures over 45 years and NEVER a failure or repair) I eventually migrated to Canon/Minolta P&S; just for the convenience.  I have tried several digital SLR's but simply can't put up with the weight and bulk other than in a studio.  So the Sony NEX-5 seemed like a good idea.And it was!  Bought the whole shooting match - 16 mm lens, 18-55 zoom, fish-eye, accessories, etc.  And really, on balance everything worked very well in the beginning.  My best shots were superb, and anything else was my error.  The menu is clunky, but it got the job done.  Optical quality excellent.  Overall, very satisfied and about to make the huge investment in a serious underwater housing, strobes etc (I am a SCUBA diver).Then I noticed that my pictures were no longer so sharp - at least not all the time.  Perplexed, I finally got into figuring out what was going on.  Turns out that the Autofocus system had begun to selectively malfunction.  Worked in full auto (intelligent idiot) mode, but in shutter or aperture modes the screen image just pulsated in and out of focus.Still - I am a patient guy.So I called up Sony service (still under warranty) and began the process of getting the camera fixed.EVERYTHING AFTER THIS IS A DISASTER!Following instructions, I shipped the camera to Sony's repair facility in Laredo, Texas with a detailed description of the problem.  A week later I got a nice email from the service person saying they couldn't reproduce the problem - please call.  So I did - using the number given me.  Got some idiot who managed to find my repair order on the computer and said it was in repair and that someone would call me in two days.  I objected that I was asked by the repair person to call and that is what I was doing, so please put me through.  Finally bumped up to \"Customer Service\", nice young man who listened and said he would put me in touch with the service facility, then put me on hold for just over 30 minutes.  Fortunately I had work to do and had the Sony people on the speaker phone, but really - by now I had spent more time on the phone than my charge-out rate.Bottom line is that the camera stopped working, it's gone, haven't heard from Sony, and really, I don't need this kind of aggravation.  I'll let Sony keep the body, sell the lenses and accessories on Ebay and wait for Nikon to come out with a reliable, quality camera.  I suggest you do the same.UPDATE:It took another week, during which I received no communications, but Sony eventually repaired the camera and returned it to me.  No cost, but much lost photo opportunity.  I will update further as camera's durability becomes clear.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Use your old manual lenses, microscope, or backyard telescope with a high res digital back", "Author": "Doctor.Generosity", "ReviewID": "R2FEWRNPEESL9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony NEX is basically a little box containing a DSLR sized sensor, an interchangeable lens flange, and an LCD. In other words, a digital camera back. I bought it specifically to be able to make use of my collection of old Pentax Takumar screw mount (M42) manual lenses from the 1970's. These old lenses have wonderful optical and mechanical quality - but how to make use of them for digital photography? When I learned that one can buy an M42-to-e mount adapter for the NEX, I decided to try it.First, this is a delightful device with all the Sony magic for precision manufacturing of tiny consumer products. The mechanical shutter whirs and clicks charmingly (but is a bit noisey for candid photography in public). More and more NEX lenses are being offered and Sony does support full use of their existing range of alpha lenses on the NEX5, but it requires use of an expensive adapter - makes sense only if you already have those lenses. But how does the NEX work with the old Takumar lenses? Answer: it works, but with some limitations. There is a digital magnifier to help with manual focus, but of course this is slow. No auto exposure; one must use manual shutter and aperture settings. And naturally the Sony lens anti-vibration system will not be operational. Finally, the old manual lenses were designed for full frame 35mm, so you are not really getting the most out of them when you have to factor in the 1.5X crop factor. All in all, using this with the old lenses is a bit of a parlor trick, more like an old fashioned view camera than a pocket point-and-shoot, and works best on a tripod. As a hobbyist, I enjoy fiddling around with stuff like this but it's not really very practical for active photography.Where the NEX series really shines is for attachment to backyard amateur telescopes, a spotting scope, or a conventional optical microscope; if you check around the internet you will find plenty of adapters to do those things and some mind boggling images. Through the wonders of mass production for consumer products, this sensor is far higher quality and lower cost than most of the dedicated digital backs sold for microscopy, which until now cost about a thousand dollars for 5 megapixels. Cool!But what about image quality? I compared both JPEGs and RAW with the NEX-5 with the 18-55 kit lens, a Canon S95 pocket camera, and my Nikon D7000. I tried this at ISO 1600 and also ISO 400. For the JPEG's, the NEX5 using the 18-55 Sony zoom gave a distinctly nicer image than the Canon but not quite comparable with the Nikon. However, when I repeated the test with RAW instead of JPEG files, the NEX 5 images were just as good as the Nikon. I conclude that while the sensor is superb, the JPEG processing in the Sony is imperfect.Other observations: Battery runs down quickly. Also, although the NEX-5 has a big 24x18mm sensor like a DSLR, it does not offer the instantaneous shutter response of a DSLR - there is a bit of lag, more like a pocket camera. Also one must go through the menu system for all the special settings and this is tedious. Also the autofocus sometimes seem a bit confused or slow to respond. Finally the NEX lenses such as the 18-55 are only so-so optically. They are plasticky, and not up to the build quality of the body.Summary: Deficiencies as noted but a beautiful precision product and great fun to use. Yes, the smallest camera with this level of image quality. For the use of old legacy lenses, a bit too complicated - it would be more worthwhile if someone would put out something like this with a FULL frame sensor to take maximum advantage of the millions of SLR lenses floating around out there. Do I recommend buying the NEX 5? Definitely, if you will be attaching to a telescope or microscope, if you're a gadget freak like me, or for those attracted by the full package beyond ordinary still photos - high quality movies, HDR, panoramas, and (believe it or not), 3D.Finally, this is a new product and still under development. Sony is getting a good sales response and can be counted on to improve the system over time, so you may want to wait and get the next generation. Be sure to update the firmware from the Sony website; although I only bought my NEX5 last week, it came with Version 01 and the latest is already 04. You will also have to download the separate little manuals for V2 (taking 3D photos to be played back on 3D TV) and V3 (soft keys) and V4 (other new stuff).", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "A perfect blend of style and quality.", "Author": "Linh Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2SN6WDM931KBG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It wasn't my original intention to purchase an EVIL (Electronic Viewfinder with Interchangeable Lens) camera when I went out looking for my first DSLR back in January. But got a deal on a Sony NEX and after a few months of using this slick camera, I have absolutely no regret.First of all, it's unbelievable how small the camera is. I saw the pictures, I read the reviews but I was still blown away by the compact build /and/ the quality of the body. Sony sure know how to make great looking devices. Body material also seems very good. Accessories included were the usual charger, battery, (crappy) neck strap, manual and software etc. Oh, and the clip-on flash (more on this later).Now onto the good part. Image quality is AMAZING. Having upgraded from a P&S; with a tiny sensor, the difference was mind-blowing for me. Even with Intelligent Auto mode (which isn't that bad), the JPEGs came out well exposed and very noise-free (I tested it during the day). And when I had a grip on how to use the camera, I quickly switched to RAW and manual modes and the results were even better. I have to say the APS-C sensor in this camera is spectacular. I can usually go up ISO 1600 indoor and still get a decent photo. Sony NEX has a slew of different scene modes, one of which is Sweep Panorama (and 3D). I don't use them much, but nice to have.The kit lens that I got with my camera is an 18-55 f/3.5-5.6. It's an above average kit lens. Good quality but not too fast. And it's silver (wish it were black to match the body). The lens is bigger than the body and probably heavier too :) That just goes to show how incredibly small the body is. The 16mm/2.8 pancake lens is something you'll probably want to have if you need ultra portability.However, the main reason why I love my NEX is its ability to use literally any lens from any camera (with the appropriate adapter). Sony actually sell an adapter to use with their Sony Alpha-mount lenses. But I'm having so much fun buying cheap (and not so cheap) manual focus lenses and using them with my NEX. If you already have a nice collection of lenses, go on eBay and grab a few adapters ($25-30 each). The NEX lets you zoom in x7 and x14 to really fine-tune your focusing which is perfect for MF. And there's a solid lead that the next firmware release will have peaking (google this please)! I'm now the owner of a modest range of lenses which include: 28/2.8, 50/1.7, 50/2.8 Macro, 100/2.5, 28-300/3.8-5.6 and 70-300/4.0. And my wallet is still thanking me.no camera is perfect and neither is the NEX. I'll just list what I dislike about this camera. 1) Proprietary \"hot-shoe\" mount. You can't use a standard hot-shoe flash with it. And the clip-on flash is a joke. It works as a fill-flash at best. 2) No Electronic View-Finder. And no plan for it so far. 3) Image Stabilization is on-lens. Not really a problem, but a disadvantage. I understand Sony wanted to keep the body as compact as possible, but still it's something I would've liked. Oh well. 4) No mode-dial. The e-dial is fine once you get used to it. But I wish the camera had a mode-dial for quick switching.And that wraps up my amateur review of Sony's first venture into the EVIL realm.

The files that come out of this camera are beautiful, and hold well especially in low-light.  The videos are gorgeous.  The 18-55mm lens is convenient  The 16mm lens is fast, and great in low light.  The low light photos are the best in this category. I can shoot up to a useable ISO 3200! Yippee! Even ISO 6400 looks better than my previous Canon G9 at ISO 400!  I can use my Leica or Nikon glass with adapter.  Shoots lovely panoramas!The Not-So-Good: Battery life is not good. Get an extra battery. I have extra batteries for all cameras. It's just a smart way to be safe.  You may or may not like menus. I prefer dials. Having said that, the firmware upgrade addresses this with assigning buttons with functions.  The lenses though good aren't as sharp as some others I've used in other systems. Sony will be coming out with more lenses, but I wish they did this before releasing the camera.  RAW can't be read by Photoshop CS4. I have to upgrade to CS 5 or get Lightroom 3. Sony's software addresses this but converts the file. I'd prefer a DNG file, but that's me. I don't want extra files on my HD!  I wish they had more than two ratios. A firmware update could add a 1:1 ratio.  No macro yet, though there is a button for it.  Using other lenses, you lose the AF focusing, except on Sony lenses from their D-SLR line, which I hear are quite dog slow to use on this camera.  The flash is a joke, but luckily you probably won't need it.Sony is heading in the right direction. What they need to do is bring forth better lenses, which they promised to do in 2011 and 2012. I hope it won't be too late. Thankfully I like the lenses with the camera. I use it as my every day camera along with a Leica D-Lux 4 and Nikon D90 respectively. When I want to experiment, I use Leica glass with an adapter. Menus are not my favorite thing, which I mentioned. I do wish there were dials. The only thing saving me from selling this camera are the files it produces. The files are wonderful, especially in low light. I haven't seen any low light photos coming out of a smaller that held together as nicely as these at ISO 1600 and ISO 3200.

I photograph choral groups in less than ideal lighting settings. The NEX 5 handles low-light shots extremely well (particularly when flash cannot be used). Speaking of the flash attachment...some reviews have been critical that it's not integrated into the camera itself. Easy fix...keep it attached (simple). However, to date, I have used the flash very little.I purchased the NEX-5 with the 18-55 lens. It is responsive and quick to focus. In addition, the on/off switch can be left on...and after your preset time, it goes to a standby setting. This is worth a lot because you are not constantly powering up the camera. Yes, this tends to drain the battery more quickly, but I carry two fully charged batteries with me at all shoots.The NEX 5 does not have an included view-finder. There has been some criticism of this \"lack\", however, for most (since the LCD screen is stunningly clear) that's basically a non-issue.I have had both a DSLR and a digital Point and Shoot. This, for me, is an ideal camera. I have the benefits of the DSLR (and more) without the bulk...and have more options and better photographs than can be generally shot with the Point and Shoot. I needed/wanted a camera that's easy to carry, has only a few lens options, and takes great shots. This, for me, is it. If I have so many lens choices...by the time I can exchange the lens, the photo opportunity is gone.It shoots stunning video; even handheld....the stereo built-in microphones are quite good too. While shooting video, the camera will adjust to variant lighting as you pan through your shot. When using the telephoto zoom (in/out), there is NO sound...and it is not picked up by the inboard microphones. Yeah...The PMB software that comes with the Sony NEX 5 is fairly good...and of course, recognized the RAW file type. Adobe is going to release (soon) an update for their RAW support in CS5 and Lightroom 3 to accommodate RAW files from the Sony NEX 5.

I debated a long while in deciding what camera to get as my second camera and wanted something that was small and delivered high quality photos.  I tried tried out a lot of high end point and shoots and dabbled in the micro four thirds systems of panasonic and olympus.  Ultimately I found the look of the Nex 5 camera more appealing than the other cameras.  The camera got lot of bad reviews about the user interface but like anything new, takes some time to get use to and proficient at it.  I find most of the complaints about it are from the \"older\" camera generation.  Take the time to learn it to really see the potential of the camera and see that it really isn't that complicated... just look on flickr and you'll see that most would agree.

The body form feels nice like my bigger SLR camera.  This alone edged out the GF1 and GH2, both great cameras as well.battery life- I've gotten a few days of random shooting and video off a single charge.  New firmware update addressed an issue with battery so highly recommend you upgrade.quality- the huge crop sensor lets you take amazing pictures, I've cranked up the iso 1600 and even 3200 and still have great usable low noise pictures.  This hands down blows away any high point and shoot camera like g12 or p7000.cool features- I find myself taking more videos, HDR, and panorama pictures with the camera very often.  The tilting screen is awesome to have for ground or high up shots.  Continuous AF is super fast on video.  Comes with a very nice external flash.Cons-lenses- not many E-mount lenses are out now but more should be coming down the pipeline.  Adapters for other mount systems is the only other way to go for the moment.price- bit more expensive than your average point and shoot but the quality and versatility makes it worth it.viewfinder- though for a camera of this size, I think a view finder would be ridiculous but still a con.Why over other cameras?I found the value of the Nex and what it can do to be unique and not found in any other camera in the market right now.

But I really wanted a lighter, smaller camera for travel.  I tried using a Canon Powershot 11 and found it to be pretty handy, but I wasn't completely happy with photo quality due to the smallish sensor size.  As I was preparing for a trip to Guatemala, I decided at almost the last moment to get a NEX 5 to bring along after seeing a friend use one at a wedding.After trudging up and down jungle paths, around city streets and markets I am very pleased to report that the NEX 5 exceeded my expectations on pretty much all fronts.  BTW, I read DP Review's in depth review and some of the reviews on Amazon before making the leap and recommend that anyone thinking of buying a camera check such reviews as they give you information that can keep you from being surprised or disappointed.Before I bought, I already knew that I prefer a camera with a viewfinder (which explains the Canon Powershot) and that I was giving that up with the NEX 5.  However, in practical use over two weeks and hundreds of photos, I rarely missed the viewfinder although I did have to use my reading glasses to see the screen clearly.  The LCD screen typically worked just fine and the ability to essentially \"palm\" the camera to take some shots unobtrusively was a good trade-off for me.In retrospect, I would have been well-served to have had more time to study the manual with camera in hand before I left.  For example, I discovered in the \"Camera\" menu a digital zoom function, but it didn't seem to operate -- I discovered back home that it works on non-zoom lenses only.  That would have possibly made the 16mm wide angle lens a more interesting tool a few times when I stopped to switch from the 16mm to the kit 18-55mm zoom.  I have uploaded three photos to show how the digital zoom performs using the 16mm lens and then zooming to 5x and 10x.  The file size of the three photo got progressively smaller and from what I can see comparing with Photoshop, the picture quality of the 5x is about the same as if I had taken the original photo without the digital zoom and cropped the are which appears in the 5x digital zoom.  Thus, you can effectively do the same thing with post-processing cropping as you get with the digital zoom, with what appears to be similar quality degradation. But it is an interesting in camera feature for when you are in the field.I was very pleased with the wide range of shots that the camera can accommodate using the various settings and the high quality of the digital images that the stock lens and the 16mm wide angle capture.Although I do not take much video, a did get some nice HD clips whose quality surprised me from this little package.  The only quality issue was from my being a very amateur videographer.While I still prefer a viewfinder and the ability to use diopter settings, I would not sacrifice the nice size and weight of this unit to have that feature. I would definitely prefer an LCD screen that has more movement, more along the lines of the A33, which can fold the LCD screen into the back of the camera.I discovered the limited programmability of the so-called buttons on the camera and used that feature, although I have not yet settled on the final programming.It definitely pays to become familiar with the camera menus and the functions and read the manual.My one suggestion to SONY would be to bring out a zoom with a range of 18-90mm (27-135mm equivalent for a 35mm film camera), the 3x range of the kit lens is a bit short and the size of the 18-200mm 11x zoom lens is a bit big and bulky.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "an amazing camera", "Author": "Standingtree", "ReviewID": "R3K213XM996MP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is definitely one of my fav cameras all time.I really enjoyed the smart features like other people have discussed here.Several things to note:1) it is easy to use canon EF lenses on it once you use an adapter and the effect is stunning2) The anti motion blur is just crazy with very clean picture at iso 6400  ; this just blow my mind!!!3) the 18-55 lens is not that small---- I like the 16mm lens much better4) Videos are great!get it and you will not regret !", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this camera", "Author": "D.

I actually like the menus, though other reviewers complain about it.  As a casual user, I'm not so sure dedicated buttons are that great.  The menus do help explain what's going on.I also like the manual focus, though this is something that perhaps a dedicated button would have been a good idea for.  Still, there's plenty of flexibility in the ways the menus are set up.The quality is astounding in general.  One thing that reviewers sometimes forget to point out is that with so many pixels and such a high quality sensor, you can sometimes crop away 90% of the original and still get a fine photo, which is sort of like a digital zoom, but one that really works well.One thing I'm discovering is how easy it is to double the cost of this camera with add-ons:  the case comes in 2 parts, and costs $100 total.  An extra battery (which I can probably do without) is about $60.  The optical viewfinder is another $200, and, if I wind up taking many more photos, I'm probably gonna get.I considered many competitors to this camera.

After going through about 10 point and shoot cameras over the years because of bad picture quality, I stumbled upon the Sony NEX 5. However, this is not the perfect camera but neither is the Nikon D700. The Sony NEX has the larger sensor (23.4mm x 15.6mm) vs a standard point and shoot sensor of 6.17mm x 4.55mm. (All DSLR cameras with a 1.5 crop factor have the same size sensor of the NEX 5) And yes, size does make a difference. But what is more interesting is how Sony chose some amazing ways to get that sensor to output some really quality photos. I hate utilizing flash which is almost a requirement in dim lighting with most p & s cameras....even the ones with F/2.8. So, one of my favorite settings with the NEX 5 is the blur setting that takes 6 or 7 rapid photos and combines them to make one sharp image. Amazingly sharp. I also like the light weight and compact size of the NEX. With the 16mm pancake lens it easily fits into a shirt pocket or jacket. I usually leave the 18-55mm lens on the camera and it does fit into cargo pants pockets or is easy to carry around. Another favorite feature is the tiltable LCD screen. What a godsend for people like myself with back problems who like to shoot high and low angles. (I'm still waiting for the next high end full frame Nikon with an articulating LCD screen) Now, the bad news. The menu system is awful! You have to wade through a ton of stuff to get to some settings that are deeply buried in the menu system. I also wish it bracketed EV shots. There is an HDR setting that brackets 3 shots then combines them but it's not a true bracket. I can manually bracket but it takes time. I wish it would bracket at least 5 shots. More bad news is the battery life. Terrible!! Mainly because the LCD is on constantly but I'd rather have that than an electronic viewfinder. I suggest a 2nd battery for long events. Also, the availability of lenses....only 3 so far.

When I am in the mood to enjoy my photography skills is when I get these manual focus lens out. I took several test shots with Zeiss M-mount Biogon 35mm $800+ lens and kits lens and have them on my flickr. You can look for user kitsVA.As you have read in other reviews the camera excels in low light and the video recording is almost as good as with decent camcorder. Just make sure you load up a fast memory card.My only problems with the NEX is there are no good prime lens yet and I don't want to deal with adapters for long as they ruin the advantage you get with a small camera.

I use my Nikon D700 F (N level) lenses with this camera and the resolution is awesome.

The mono pod works well..If you using the E lenses that are available for the Nex then you won't need the mono pod. NEXT..

I did not trade them in thinking that one day something good would be available for me to once again use these outstanding optics.Enter Nex5...I purchased the Hasselblad to Nex 5 adapter for under $100 and use all 5 of my Hassie lenses from 60 to 250mm. The photos were very special with regard to color and resolution. Again heavy to handle without a mono pod but what great photos. Equal to inmy opinion the images I am getting with my Hasselblad film camera and very close to the D700 images in very large prints. I really could not tell the difference up to 16x20 between the two cameras using the Hasselblad 50 and 120 cf lenses in particular andthe Nikon 16-35 N zoom lens and the 18-200 N zoom lens. This is not a fast shooting setup for vacations or parties in the way I am using them. If your doing vacation or parties then use the E 18-55 Nex lens. Works fast and the image quality is fine for a point and shoot situation.VERY SPECIAL STUFF USING THE HASSIE AND NIKON LENSES IN RAW MODE. I alo advise even thought the M-Assist is available to use an Optical view finder accessory if your over 40 and you vision is beginning to take a walk. This really helps to nail the focus.

However because this isn't a simple point and shoot a SLR/APS-C sensor with a detachable lens the NEX-5 felt too cramped. Had i not held both the NEX-3 and NEX-5 I would of purchased the NEX-5 but I ultimately went w/ the  NEX-3. The larger body felt better balanced in my hands and my left fingers were not cramped when adjusting the zoom. Feeling is similar to if you hold a Canon Rebel line vs a 40d/50d/5d or a 60d compared to a 7d. My primary cameras have been and are 20d/40d/7d with heavy L series lenses and a Canon G9 for point and shoot. Upon firing up the camera at the sony store it was set to panorama and it started firing away just like a larger SLR and then stiched the pictures together. VERY cool. The camera wasn't an instant on like a true SLR but it did fire up w/in a second or just as fast as traditional point and was ready to go. Not having a fixed zoom lens also reduced the time it normally takes for point and shoots to zoom out the lens. Burst shots were quick and picture quality was stunning for a camera of this size.  I paid full retail for a NEX-3 with an attachable flash, 18-55 lens. Great value and finally a real point and shoot companion to my SLR's.One reason why people started purchasing SLR was picture quality, and true burst shots but most don't even bother to open up the manual let alone use an SLR in any other setting than full auto. I also saw friends/families with SLR that got sick and tired of lugging it around due to its weight/size.

Can't comment on the 16mm lens because I bought this with the 18-55mm lens (3X zoom). The lens has severe barrel distortion and vignetting unless you aren't shooting anything up-close. The wide angle is excellent. The auto setting works very well and what I use most of the time. The Sweep Panorama works fine but not as well as the DSC-HX5V (I won't get into technical details) and uses battery much faster because the lens clicks and clacks a few times per second to stitch together the panorama. The resolution and quality are quite good (not so great on the DSC-HX5V). It is nice the battery percentage is shown on the display, and like most cameras, tells the number of images and length of movies remaining on the card. You can choose RAW + JPEG, which is great in that unlike most P&S; cameras with RAW capability is they record the normal quality instead of the fine quality, so you get the best possible quality on the NEX-5. You can even choose sRGB or Adobe RGB 1998 (it seems to be a closer match to the color richness on printed magazines through experimentation in Photoshop).As far as movie quality, compared to a compact such as DSC-HX5V, in terms of low noise and color accuracy, the NEX-5 is about as good as daytime outdoors, and somewhat better indoors and out in a parking lot with some streets lights nearby. Sound quality is better than most P&S; cameras and in stereo too. You can get even better sound via a microphone accessory but then you can't use flash or EVF (the socket atop the camera between the built-in microphones). Too bad there isn't the option to record in 720 (Standard HD) because you have only 1080 (Full HD) and 480 (VGA) resolutions. Don't like it there is no 4:3 photo resolution (just 3:2 and 16:9) as common on most cameras, but it may be because of the lenses and wide angle technology in the NEX series. Oh well. I can use my other cameras for 720p video and 4:3 aspect ratio. Another thing, which most cameras don't have, is the option to record audio with the movie. In some situations you don't want audio in the movie, and will cut down on file size too.I am finally satisfied with a camera because all the P&S; I have owned and still own just aren't good enough and I want to take photos like my Dad's Canon EOS. Sure, he has much more expensive lenses that you probably can't use on this Sony, but it might have been better had Sony improved their lenses so that the barrel distortion (or 'widening in the middle' effect) wouldn't be as noticeable. That's why I am giving this camera four stars instead of five.Size and weight is five stars. You can't really get smaller with the large sensor Sony put in. Amazing stuff. Battery life isn't as good but probably due to both operation of the camera and the lens clicking and clacking. Firmware update didn't seem to improve battery life so you're always better off with spare batteries. I do exactly that, and fortunately, they aren't too expensive compared to some other battery brands.Look and feel is a bit plain but it is very well-designed, grip is good for big hands, rugged, and the controls are average, so I'll say good job Sony and rate this category five stars. Putting on the shoulder strap takes some time and patience but you get use to it.Coolness factor is five stars. It is about as typical or ordinary as the bulky body of a DSLR, but the screen is of very high resolution (somewhat close to a megapixel, wow) and I like that you can choose the background color, which happens to be blue (because I live in an apartment with doors painted blue).Software is four stars in that I am not too certain how well it works and how thorough it is and don't intend to use it. Other reviewers have said it is good unlike some other camera software which was said to have problems. I simply move files from the camera card and rename them manually. You just have to go through some folders with vague names to find the movies or photos--nothing more than a short maze (figuratively).I won't rate the customer service and tech support because I haven't needed it and don't plan to make use of services, even though I have registered some software.Image quality is four stars because it could be better with an improved lens, and perhaps RAW might give even better results. Furthermore, I have noticed that focusing is a bit of a problem with green objects. Many photos I have taken in the woods and of plants with flowers have come out blurry. Does anyone have an explanation on this? It could be a green channel (technical) issue. My other P&S; cameras have been blurry or off-color (bluish, brownish, or yellowish) with green objects as well, along with slightly poor focusing, but it seems the worst on the NEX-5. As said, the lens quality is a four out of five.Overall, this camera is 4.5 out of five stars for me.One last note, the flash attachment isn't that difficult to affix, and it has better coverage than any of my P&S.; I tested it once in my living room but haven't yet used it once for any intended photos.Thanks for reading my review.

The battery life is decent enough to last a day or two of shooting, it has an automatic HD video record button, it feels sturdy and strong, the screen tilts up and down, it has panorama mode, smile detection, auto HDR, it has lots of cool features, and above all the price was decent.If you're a beginner it has tutorials and tips for you, and teaches you how to use things like aperture and shutter speed without using the linguo making it really easy to understand and get a good base for when you want to upgrade to a normal dslr.It won't fit in your pants pocket but it definitely fits in your coat/jacket pocket with no problem.

I was looking for a mid-range digital SLR with a small profile (I hate the idea of lugging around a bulky camera on family trips and such) and the ability to shoot HD video.  The new \"mirrorless\" DSLRs were a perfect match for my needs.  In this category there are currently only a handful of cameras, and I found that each of the others had some drawback that I couldn't live with.  In particular, I wanted to use this camera as a replacement (or at least supplement) for my bulky, aging Sony Digital 8 camcorder.  Anything short of full HD video isn't acceptable, and I need to be able to record more than a few minutes at a time.  This camera has a limit of something like 25 minutes, which is still a bit limiting but more than suitable for my needs (does anyone really want to sit through a single clip longer than that?)I've been very pleased with the camera, its features, and the resulting photos.  I can't point to anything that really disappoints me, and I'm a very tough critic of electronic gadgets.  Some of the issues mentioned in earlier reviews have been corrected in the latest firmware.  Sure, the battery life could be better, but an extra battery is cheap, and I find it's always good to have a spare anyway so I can still use the camera while one battery's charging.I should probably mention that I've never used a \"real\" SLR before, so this is a big step up from the point-and-shoots I've used over the years (mainly Canon Powershots).  Other than the lack of an optical viewfinder (which I hardly ever use anyway), the NEX-5 doesn't seem to compromise on much as compared with a DSLR.  I mean, I'm sure the big boys have some features this camera lacks, but I'd never use them.  The picture quality is great, even in low light, and the HD video recording is a big plus.  I really like the dedicated button for movie recording, a big improvement over having to switch in and out of \"movie mode.\"In terms of features, I'm particularly impressed with the Sweep Panorama and Auto HDR modes.  This kind of automation is a huge time saver for someone like me who like to tinker with advanced techniques but has no patience to spend hours stitching or merging pictures on my PC.  (You can probably guess that I'm not a big fan of taking RAW shots either, but it's good to know it's there for some day when I have more free time on my hands.)So all in all I'm pleased with the camera and have no real complaints thus far (after shooting over 1000 stills and several videos).

Looking as good as any 35mm camera, the image size for the best shots run 4592 X 2576 and can range from 4 to 9 megabytes in size, depending on what mode you are shooting in. Every firmware update Sony has released for this camera only adds more options. The latest update allows for awesome spot color black and white pictures that are truly incredible.Where we use the cameras the most is for shooting short films. The movie mode of the Nex-5 shoots in true high-definition 1920 by 1080 using the h.264 compression format. Clear, sharp and true to life images all the way. It will also shoot in mp4 format, but the high-def quality is less at 1440 by 1080.The bonus of this camera is its weight. Weighing only about a pound and a half with the 18-55mm lens, it is simple to haul around - whether in a camera bag or using the strap around your neck. This camera will not weigh you down.For independent filmmakers who still like to shoot in 24p, well, this camera isn't going to do it for you.  It shoots in 60i, but hey...that is one thing you can certainly 'fix in post' if you are dead-set on 24p.Sony offers several different lenses for the Nex-5 along with an adapter that will allow for the use of Alpha (a) lenses.For the money, you really can't beat the Nex-5.

Most of my photos are of my kids, so a lot of close ups and vacation shots, both in bright light and indoors.  There are a few areas where the Nex is completely unacceptable.  The auto focus is awful.  It has multiple options for auto focus including face recognition and child priority, yet it misses the spot to focus on at least 20% of the time.  I just came back from vacation and I have many outdoor shots with the background in focus and my kids, front and center, out of focus.  The auto exposure and auto white balance are also poor.  Shot to shot, under the sam conditions, the readings change, giving no consistency between photos from the same scene and poor color and exposure overall.  Lastly, you absolutely can't see the screen in bright light.  How Sony could include this LCD in a camera with no viewfinder is beyond me.  I'm crossing my fingers that the auto focus and exposure get fixed with a firmware update, but users are stuck with this terrible LCD.  My 5 year old canon rebel never had these problems, great pictures all the time. Because I trust these amazon reviews, I exchanged my camera for another Nex, thinking I got a lemon.  No improvement.

It's truely an amazing camera and innovative.  Slick design, nice menu system with help, fast shutter speed and continuous shooting.  The shooting speed rivals many SLR's and will beat any micro 4/3 camera on the market.  Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed with the auto focus for Sony Nex 3; it seemed to be random hit or miss.  The resulting pictures were a bit blur or soft.  I wasn't able to get decent shots without using the manual settings.  My suspicion is that the kit lens for Sony Nex 3 & 5 are crap.  Although Sony boast this camera as being light weight, I didn't get that feel.  You really need to hold this camera with two hands, because the lens is heavy while the body is light; also, the lens is offset to the left rather than being in the center.If you really want the Sony Nex 3/5, buy a better lens for it; or buy a mount adapter and reuse your existing lens.  Otherwise, skip it and look elsewhere.  It's just a shame how Sony skewed up on what would otherwise be an awesome camera.  The cost of the Sony Nex 3/5 isn't exactly cheap either; for a little more, you can get a full SLR.  My bet is you will be lured to buy and bring it home, and then return after a few days after seeing the blurry resulting images.My recommendation is to skip the Sony Nex 3/5 or wait for the next version.  Other micro 4/3 cameras on the market may have better sharpness for images, but have high shutter lag; you're better off with a modern p&s; I have the Nikon S8100.  I'm currently looking at the Sony a580, which looks really promising.  The Sony a580 rivals the Canon D7 and Nikon D7000 which cost at least 2x more.  I've done extensive research, and no micro 4/3 or SLR can come close to my requirements except the Sony a580.  I recommend using snapsort.com to compare the specs. of one camera to another.[...]Another thing I like about the Sony a580 is the size; it's a bit smaller and lighter than the Canon D7 and Nikon D7000, which are both excellent SLRs.

If you put the mediocre pancake 16mm 2.8 lens on it, it is small but the pictures are nowhere near the fantastic pancake from Panasonic the 20mm 1.7f.So it is not small.  The small version does not have near the quality of the PEN.It ends up being neither here nor there.In other words, the whole point of embarking on this kind of camera is to 1) make it small and 2) make DSLR quality pictures.  That requires its pancake lens to be small and to be great.  The 16mm is not a great lens.  No review compliments it so.  And the 18-55 lens is large.

The camera has a 1-year warranty and this lens was clearly in virtually new condition - not a scratch or mark on it anywhere, and even in the original bubble wrap that I'd always kept it in, so I figured this would be pretty routine. Long story short, the battle that followed with Sony was absolutely horrendous. Basically, I was told they wouldn't honor the warranty because the product was not designed to break, therefore despite having absolutely no evidence of this, I must have somehow intentionally damaged an internal component without touching the exterior at all. I spoke/wrote to several staff who all assured me that no situation exists where the NEX-5 warranty would be honored, under any circumstances.

Now here comes the unforgiving parts:  A good product should also include good service and that is something Sony lacks severely.  I say severely because they really have no idea how important customer service is.  If you anger one customer, it's no surprise many will follow (eventually).  I purchased this product a year ago and when I returned it (so I could purchase the bundle pack instead), they tell me they never received the product back.  They needed a tracking number, which I lost so I was out $600.  My fault, yes, and I still received the bundle package thereafter, but the $600 I could not get back for my return still bothers me to this day.  After learning my lesson the first time around, I started keeping all my tracking information with me at all times in case a situation such as the one noted above occurred again.  Little did I know, it happens again in the month of July 2011 when I purchased a Fish Eye Conversion lens for my a-Nex5 and Sony ends up sending me an $800 DSLR camera lens instead.  Sure, I could have kept it and sold it on Ebay and made a fortune, but being the good civilian that I am, I ended up calling Sony's Customer Service to inform them they sent me the wrong lens (which by the way, happened to cost at least $700 more than the lens I originally ordered) and I would like to receive a refund back.  They send me an e-mail with a return shipping label and I return the product to FedEx in the same week. The product arrives at their location in mid-July and a technician calls me up to ask what I need fixed on the lens.  I tell him this was a return order b/c Sony sent me the wrong lens to begin with.  Also, I should note I put the return confirmation information inside the return box so I don't understand why he would ask me this to begin with.  Also, the guy didn't seem to understand why it was sent to his department, but tells me he will take care of it and not to worry.  8 weeks later (mid-September), no response and no credit back to my credit card so I call Sony's Customer Service again and I am told that the product was received back to their company and a credit will be issues soon.  Two weeks pasts (September 28th) and still no credit so I call them back and have to relay my story all over again.

My still pictures were just fine, but I have been trying to get into amateur videography and had noticed that the more impressive video work I had seen on YouTube was being done on DSLRs, similar to my Nikon, except that my Nikon doesn't do video. At all. I do also have a Zoom Q3HD which takes decent video and excellent audio, but doesn't offer the rich control of a camera that has an adjustable lens as with DSLRs. So, enter the Sony NEX-3 and NEX-5, I was floored by the offering. Now I could have the functional output equivalent of a DSLR with full aperture control, background blurs, etc., on a relatively inexpensive point-and-shoot size (excluding the lens) camera for a lot less money than the more impressive DSLRs I had seen on YouTube.I was initially SO excited about my new purchase of the NEX-5, which I chose over the NEX-3 because it captures high resolution video. And at $150-ish more expensive just for hi-def video, I expected it to do extremely well with video work. What I didn't expect to find were two fatal flaws big enough that I will likely be putting this camera on Craigslist shortly.1. No camera control once video recording begins. Focus is either pre-set or completely hands-free AF. Officially, it only supports completely hands-free AF, so focus will be going all over the place especially if the camera is moving around between light sources. On the other hand, there are ways to go manual as well. What I would have preferred is a more user-interfaced AF feature, such as showing a focus cursor on the LCD with movement controls, as an additional focus option.2. It overheated in just 5 minutes! Granted, I live in a hot area, but the room is cooled to about 74 degrees F. In just 5 minutes it started blinking an \"overheating\"  icon, and five or ten minutes after that it completely shut down, with a message that it needs to cool down. SERIOUSLY?!Some folks such as over at dpreview-dot- com's forums have had the nerve and audacity to respond to this matter with a simple, \"The NEX-5 is not a camcorder, it's a still camera that can shoot video.\" EXCUSE ME?! I do NOT see that description nor disclaimer ANYWHERE on this product's description. The description doesn't say \"camcorder\", either, but who calls them camcorders anymore these days anyway? Regardless, it does indeed claim to support shooting video, and that does NOT mean a mere 5 to 15 minutes of it. People are also posting comments like, \"People don't want to watch long clips anyway.\" What the heck, people? Even if that was relevant, we're talking about long clips with equally long cool-down times between them!I'd feel jipped but really I am just perplexed and deeply disappointed. I was so excited, now I have what I feel like is a high-tech brick. If I wanted to take still pictures I'd just use my Nikon D50.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Undecided", "Author": "Nanamama \"CQ\"", "ReviewID": "R6QKNTPPIP2S3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We got this camera because it looked cool and having the interchangeable lens seemed to be a very attractive feature.

I like the size and the look. I owned several different cameras (Sony DSCF828,H1,P120 Panasonic FP3, ZS5 Nikon 300)  and this NEX5 is a disaster. The picture quality is so poor, the auto focus is a joke. All the pictures that I took indoor or outdoors are awful...You can never get a sharp picture with NEX5. I really made a big misake to buy this camera.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Think twice", "Author": "Eye Forget", "ReviewID": "R2FICTSV03KLUH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is the third attempt at writing a review of the NEX5.If you are a newby to photography, take a pass as there's a learning curve you will have to go through and the menu system, and Sony's unique feature terminology, don't make it easy on you.If you are an accomplished photographer, consider you are purchasing a fairly expensive camera many  point-and-shoots can outperform. Think S95/100, or the G series.If you have a dslr and want a more portable camera, buy a point-and-shoot. You will be sorely disappointed with the abilities of the NEX5 compared to your dslr.  You may as well be disappointed with a camera costing a third the price.If you are a point-and-shoot photographer who wants to step into the world of interchangeable lenses, you're not getting much bang for your buck. The zoom is slow, unless you want to delve into the menu system all the time, you will will be on iAuto all the time.If the solid video appeals to you, buy a video cam.I don't really see a role for this camera. Ours has become a paperweight. Neither my son who purchased it, nor I, ever pick it up. On a recent trip to Italy, I had a choice between a Nikon D80, a Canon G7, a Canon SD1200 or the NEX5. I wanted compact and the SD1200 was the choice. To suggest it yields better images quality would bring out the rage of the hobbyists who use the Sony but I will take the risk. I feel the little Canon has better focus ability, better color balance and is better in high contrast situations.Do I know how to use the NEX5, no? Do I want to bother, no? I've been a hobbyist photographer for over 40 years.  And I have to now learn how to decipher what Sony means with the marketing terms it employs in the menu's, remember which controls severely limit aperture settings to accomplish their objective, with a resulting substantial boost in iso, little to none of which is noted in the view finder to alert me?  No thanks.I have no pride of ownership and I'd need a lot to defend what was paid for the NEX5 relative to what's already laying around the house.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony's poor customer service is unfortunately mixed-in with a good product", "Author": "Lee the Reader", "ReviewID": "RENXR4N7CHPGC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "PLEASE NOTE:  I'm giving this product an overall 1 star rating due to Sony's poor customer service...not due to the actual performance of the product.  The product works as described and hasn't malfunctioned since I purchased it a year ago.  Photos taken are very crisp and clear compared to other brands out there and the size of the camera is an attribute other companies should follow and if possible, try to catch up with (which I doubt).  Now here comes the unforgiving parts:  A good product should also include good service and that is something Sony lacks severely.  I say severely because they really have no idea how important customer service is.  If you anger one customer, it's no surprise many will follow (eventually).  I purchased this product a year ago and when I returned it (so I could purchase the bundle pack instead), they tell me they never received the product back.  They needed a tracking number, which I lost so I was out $600.  My fault, yes, and I still received the bundle package thereafter, but the $600 I could not get back for my return still bothers me to this day.  After learning my lesson the first time around, I started keeping all my tracking information with me at all times in case a situation such as the one noted above occurred again.  Little did I know, it happens again in the month of July 2011 when I purchased a Fish Eye Conversion lens for my a-Nex5 and Sony ends up sending me an $800 DSLR camera lens instead.  Sure, I could have kept it and sold it on Ebay and made a fortune, but being the good civilian that I am, I ended up calling Sony's Customer Service to inform them they sent me the wrong lens (which by the way, happened to cost at least $700 more than the lens I originally ordered) and I would like to receive a refund back.  They send me an e-mail with a return shipping label and I return the product to FedEx in the same week. The product arrives at their location in mid-July and a technician calls me up to ask what I need fixed on the lens.  I tell him this was a return order b/c Sony sent me the wrong lens to begin with.  Also, I should note I put the return confirmation information inside the return box so I don't understand why he would ask me this to begin with.  Also, the guy didn't seem to understand why it was sent to his department, but tells me he will take care of it and not to worry.  8 weeks later (mid-September), no response and no credit back to my credit card so I call Sony's Customer Service again and I am told that the product was received back to their company and a credit will be issues soon.  Two weeks pasts (September 28th) and still no credit so I call them back and have to relay my story all over again.  This time though, I tell Sony's Customer Service that I'm going to dispute these charges within 2 business days so they better notify their bosses of the \"lack\" of service that is going on here.  Makes me wonder why I would still want to purchase from a company that offers this type of service.  Really does....So to sum it up, should I continue to purchase from a company that offers really good products OR do I just ring in the towel, get over the brand and purchase elsewhere from now on?  This is issue that will need some debating.  Anyone else there encounter these same Sony Customer Service related issues?
