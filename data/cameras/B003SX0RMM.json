{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Replacement Worked", "Author": "Warrant", "ReviewID": "RYPQ8SWQ5HAP5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Plugged this in through RCA cables to the tv, got a picture - I was excited! - no sound - dang.  I panned the camera around the room to see how it would look in different light settings, after about 2 minutes the picture cut out.  I gently jiggled the camera wires and the picture came back on.  1 minute later the picture died and never came back on.  While it was briefly working I held it close to my mouth doing a \"test-1-2-3\", never got any sound.The picture quality was average to poor, very grainy, color was bright.  It did poorly in shadows even though the rest of the room was brightly lit.  With bright lights it would do ok.  The instructions said it can be focused to adjust the picture, but I never saw a means to focus it.  Perhaps twisting the lens is the trick, but I never got that far as the picture died quickly.I didn't open the small camera unit, but the wires coming out of it are VERY thin.  The jack has 1 white (audio), 1 yellow (video), and 1 red (power).  The power supply has a small green LED to indicate it is plugged in.I immediately submitted to Amazon for a replacement, and it has already shipped.  Good thing I kept the original shipping box as I'll use that to return the first defective one.  We'll see how the replacement one works out.UPDATE:Received the second one, plugged it in, and it worked as it should.  I also tested the sound and that works.  The picture is grainy with washed out colors, but it is satisfactory for my needs.  It still does not do good in low light.UPDATE #2 11NOV2012Disappointed.  Night before Halloween I tested it and it worked.  The very next night, the whole reason I got this, it didn't work.  All I got on the tv was a blue screen, even after power on/off, and verifying the cables and input.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product, Some Things Could Be Done Better.", "Author": "Hdig", "ReviewID": "RBP77EY6S9KIT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recieved this camera via usps very promptly and it was packaged very neatly and no damage was done (or could be done, the way that they packaged it) to the camera. As was promised and expected, it was a snap to set up (just plug in power and a/v cables and a tv) and has great audio and video quality. I have been using it now for a couple of weeks now, and have had no problems with it thus far.The only things that didn't really like about this product were as follows:1. a/v, power, and microphone wires ran out the back of the camera, making it hard to mount to a flat surface like a wall. (also, you are a fool if you expect mounting hardware with this product. It only comes with the camera, the power cord, a 9volt battery adapter, and a small manual/waranty card.)2. The microphone IS NOT ATTACHED to the camera. it should be pretty obvious from the picture, but i just wanted to make sure everyone took notice to this fact.THE 2 TINGS LISTED ABOVE DO NOT HINDER PERFORMANCE OF THIS AWESOME CAMERA IN ANY WAY.OVERALL, this is a great prduct (especially for such a low price) and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, cheap camera. The 2 things listed above are not really flaws, they are more like things that i would love to see fixed on a newer version of this awesome camera. This is a great camera for home surveillance or whatever you need it for.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "awesome little camera!", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R29B9FAKH8FLXV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "got this camera cause it was so cheap. it works very well. very satisfied. just plugs right into any rca cord into your tv. great picture, very tiny, but hard to mount.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Caught!", "Author": "Ashleejg10", "ReviewID": "R3LSUDNBDY9ECG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My neighbors rifeling through my trash cans at night and the dogs that where digging in my yard.

Sometimes we need a disposable camera to mount in a weird place to catch a certain point of view. I bought one of these and we've had a blast using it. The output is not as crisp as my $7000 Sony studio camera but for $12 it is incredible how good the picture is. I tell people \"that's a $12 camera\" and they say WHAT, HOW? I just grin and say Amazon dot com.It gets a little grainy in low light but we actually like the effect, it adds to the \"post apocalypse\" theme our shows embrace.I've mounted it several times using double stick foam tape and hot glue. It is so light weight that a piece of scotch tape can be used to mount it.If you want a cheap camera to play with or to make your own SPY cam you can't beat this one for this price.
