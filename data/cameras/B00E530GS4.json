It's so tiny, it fits into the palm of my hand and so lightweight, I felt it was a store display dummy.For such a tiny fellah, it packs a big punch; 2.7\" LCD, 14 megapixels, MOS sensor, 5X optical zoom (and something called extra optical zoom which gets to 10X), and a wide angle lens. It starts up lightening fast and shoots HD videos at 1920x1080 in MP4 format, and several still shooting modes (including panorama shot, creative control and creative retouch - the latter pair enable you to apply from a selection of 13 filters).There are a few settings one can manually adjust: white balance, Colour mode, red eye removal, flash, and ISO sensitivity. The camera uses a micro SD card. I bought a 16MB high speed card (50MB/S) which stores 2,687 images at 14 megapixels, and shoots 20 minutes long movies. Charging is by USB or with the included adapter. AV out is available, as is provision for a tripod..Image and video quality is exceptional with colours (especially without flash) as close to reality as possible. Images in low light conditions are sharp with no graininess.The perfect point and shoot camera.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$198.46", "Features": "Super slim body of the business card size\nHigh efficiency to come out neatly brightly in a night view and the dark room\nSize and thinness to be settled to a breast pocket completely\nHigh sensitivity MOS sensor incorporation proud of high definition to\nIt is equipped with the Venus engine which I suppress the noise, and realizes high-speed image processing", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix digital camera 5x optical XS3 DMC-XS3 LUMIX DMC-XS3 (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ga5Y5S3ZL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E530GS4"}}
