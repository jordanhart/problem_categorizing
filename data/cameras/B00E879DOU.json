However, I subsequently realized that my location in the backwaters of civilization and the peculiarities of my country, Guyana, is what caused the shippers to underestimate the delivery time. Upon learning this, the shippers led me through all the necessary tracking and that is where I discovered the delays due to my location.I am learning how to use this camera and am enjoying the experience so far.The purpose I have in mind for it is the investigation of motion, using the high-speed features. When I succeed I shall be sure to report.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for the casual shooter", "Author": "Paul L", "ReviewID": "R2VNDQIN6L7KUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has a lot of positive features.  My wife wanted a replacement for another Casio camera that has a fast shutter speed and a multiple flash options.  This EX-ZR800 does has a fast shutter speed in non-flash taking mode, but is slower when the flash is used.  This camera should have had a shaper len for the price.  Overall does what I need it to do.  Does not come close to a micro four/third camera with a pancake len though for a pocket size camera.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sweet camera", "Author": "jack of all trades", "ReviewID": "R2Q7081O8V2I2G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got tired of my phone having better functionality that my old camera - this sucker can shoot 30 frames/second - has a great zoom and shoots excellent 360; panorama.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E879DOU"}}
