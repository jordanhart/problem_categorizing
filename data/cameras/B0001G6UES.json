Kim", "ReviewID": "R2WECZHVL823V0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited and waited a long time before I finally bought a digital camera for my wife and I'm glad that I did. Although this not the smallest camera (Casio has several good small models), I like it for several reasons.1. I have the larger DSC-F828 and very happy with Sony's line of cameras. The DSCP93 uses memory sticks just like the larger camera so no extra media to buy.2. This is a 5 megapixel camera so whatever pictures I take will look good even at 8x10.3. It's a decent size, not too large and not too small. The button placement is good. I had a camera where a function button was placed near the right thumb rest. I kept activating buttons that I did not need to.4. It has many features like movie taking and sharpness control.5. It has an optical viewfinder to save on battery life. I use the digital viewfinder for picture review.6. Talking about batteries: It gets a long life out of two \"AA\" rechargeable batteries, which came with it. Although you do have to use an external charger for these batteries it's fine since you don't have to worry about down time while the batteries charge like you would if the batteries were charged internally.7. The batteries are standard nickel metal hydride and relatively cheap and available anywhere, not expensive batteries designed just for this camera.8. Very important! When you change batteries, you do not lose your settings like the date and time.9. There is a built-in lens cover.10. Flash is bright and recharges relatively quickly.11. The telephoto is optical rather than digital.Overall, I am very happy with it. I do hate Sony's 90-day labor and 1 year parts warrranty though.", "Date": "August 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "Fabulous!", "Author": "Dupont", "ReviewID": "RGJDI52P6YAVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the first digital camera I purchased, and I must say that I got quite lucky. The resolution is brilliant at 5.1 MP. You can stretch and crop all you want without distortion, and it doesn't have that blurry look quintessential of digial cameras.  The price is an excellent bargain, especially since here it is offered for $350 (probably subject to change) as opposed to the list $450.  It is very user friendly, and has many functions to produce the optimum photo for your situation/context. The amount of flash is automatically decided by the camera, making one's life easier, although you do have the power to override flashes.  I recommend that you pruchase the two-sided, 128 MB each memory stick by sony to go along.  My only negative comment would be that the batteries are not the super-power ones found in most other cameras. I don't know much about their chemical composition or any of that, but I do maintain that the batteries have a tendency to run out rather fast. However, they are rechargeable and the camera comes with an included recharger you can plug in to an electrical outlet.  I really suggest you buy this camera. I am certainly glad I did.", "Date": "June 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "WOW! What a camera!", "Author": "John Owens", "ReviewID": "R23W87RHNYLO0X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A long-time SLR user, I was concerned that a digital camera would not satsfy my photography needs, since the only digital camera I have ever had came free with my computer.  I was not sure the convenience of a digital was worth the several hundred dollars this camera cost, but my wife kept nagging me until I bought it.  She was tired of carrying our bulky SLR camera and several roles of film every time we go to Disney.  I must say, she was right and I was wrong!!  This camera takes such excellent pics that I doubt I break out the old dinosaur too many more times!My only complaint is the very large storage size of the 5MP pics.  They look awesome, but you can't email them and can't store too many on your computer unless you have a very large storage disk.  I take hundreds of pics, so over 3MB each is just too large!  At least this camera has the ability to downgrade the size and MP for your everyday pics or pics you want to mail.  It also comes with software to easily transfer images to CD.The video and sound are good except for the fact that it is lacks the anti-vibration feature.  All-in-all, this camera is definitely worth the money!  Just make sure you have plenty of money if you decide to buy accessories--they are very expensive, but at least they are available.", "Date": "August 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great price-point for a 5mp with excellent quality", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3MK737D0OTDYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a user of both Canon and Sony Digital cameras in the past, I wanted something that used rechargeable AA's (flexible for travel) with excellent picture quality (barely noticeable picture quality from the Carl Zeiss lenses) and portability (slightly larger than the P100). Also wanted something that good samaritan photographers could use easily and hold adeptly. (this was a problem with my tiny Sony U30)  I have had numerous friends take pictures for me with this picture and the pics have been rock solid with this camera. The  price point is great. Uses Memory sticks which are coming down in price.  Also, the power up time is fast, and the shutter lag is very small.  Flash works great in dark situations.Drawbacks of the camera is that since it's using NIMH AA's there is less battery life than a Li Ion batt. The big bonus is that NiMH batteries are so prevalent.  Also works well with alkaline batteries in a pinch (I tried it out.)  There is also the styling - a tad dated compared with the snazzy new T1's, SD10's, and U40's of the world.In combination with my current U30, the P93 synergistically works as a high-photo quality camera when I don't absolutely have to have the micro camera on me.", "Date": "June 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera and ease of use", "Author": "Bruce", "ReviewID": "R1HO24J2HHMXC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a 2MP fuji to this camera.  This camera has tons more features, obviously.  I also have a D100 nikon slr 6M pixels and this camera quality of picture rivals that.  Of course it cant do the same things a digital SLR can, but I would buy this one again if it were to get stolen or something. It fits in your pocket and buy an off brand memory card for 100 bucks, get 512mb(200 pics at 5 Mp) and you are off.  Also, the movie quality on this camera is decent and the sound pick-up for such a small microphone is excellent.  You need to hold the camera very still since there is no anti-vibration switch.All in all a excellent camera.", "Date": "August 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "I like it", "Author": "C. Young", "ReviewID": "R2W3YEE6OUFGGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera.  I went with a 5.1 megapixel because I wanted the flexibility of printing larger photos if I ever wanted to.  I never have, but hey, you never know.  A few observations so far:I've heard bad things about digital zoom in terms of quality.  If you take pictures at the highest setting (5.1 megapixels), the digital zoom feature isn't available, so you don't have to worry about possibly pixelated pictures.  However, at lower settings (3 megapixel for example), the zoom bar shows a green line signifying when digital zoom is being used.  Yes, you can turn off digital zoom, but with this camera, you can keep it on and see when you are in digital zoom.I thought the battery life was weak, but it's actually pretty good.  A friend bought another brand of digital camera and complained that after taking just one picture, the battery would drain.  He found out that the batteries that shipped with his camera were cheap and underpowered and he had to buy a better battery.  The batteries with this camera are fine.  I thought the batteries were draining, but I was looking at the memory stick indicator (gimme a break, I said it was my first digital camera).Video capture is ok, especially for a camera.  I've only used the 32 MB stick that comes with the camera, and I've been able to capture the \"video mail\" size which is very small, but easy to send in an email, and the 640 size, which is better, but still a little choppy.  As I understand it, the Pro memory sticks enable you to capture at the \"Fine\" setting, which is supposed to be better.  I have still found it suitable to capture those humorous moments in video.The flash is very bright.  I took a picture where I couldn't even see anything on the LCD screen, and the flash was bright enough to make it look like the lights were on.I was able to view the pictures I took on my TV without any problems, using the cable that came with the camera.  I was also able to view the videos I took, and the videos do have sound.The camera also has sound when turning on, taking a picture, and navigating the menus.  They're not annoying, and actually are nice as confirmation for changing a setting (and when taking a picture, you get that shutter sound like on an old-fashioned camera).  It also has a volume control and plays back the sound when reviewing video on the camera.All in all, this was a great purchase, especially for my first digital camera.  It fits in a jacket pocket nicely, and has great features (I haven't even got through the manual, but it's easy enough to use without going thorough the whole thing).  One more note--it takes 6 hours to charge the batteries when you first get it (a battery charger is included).", "Date": "November 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "A GREAT Camera And A PERFECT Gift!", "Author": "Cap'n Stoob \"Stoob\"", "ReviewID": "R338J4J54IYK7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my mother for Christmas and she's taken about a thousand photos with it.What I like:-SOLID build quality-Quick start-up time-Focus-assist lamp for GREAT low light shots-Killer MPEG movie mode with high framerates and sound-Power miser...the included batteries last for hundreds of shots.-Easy-to-use USB connection.

It works very well taking pictures even at low-res (standard mode). Works fine with low light conditions and also has a powerful flash. The video capture feature works better when using a 512 MB memory stick which I also bought at amazon. With the 32 MB memory stick that comes with the camera you can't do many regarding video. The digital zoom works excellent, but only in standard mode. Pictures are taken without becoming blurry, except in manual mode where an indicator tells you that the camera is moving.The only negative thing is that two weeks after I purchased it, a white pixel appeared on the LCD screen, it's very very small and after a while it becomes unnoticeable.

The camera really produces nice pictures (and use of the maximum pixels  is certainly strongly advised) and videos. Using a tripod, one can look 'into the night' to a sufficient extent. The only bad thing that needs to be mentioned concerns the stubborn Sony strategy on the whole rather than this digi camera. The memory stick memory card is very slow compared to other cards. The camera does not support uncompressed formats, and I've heard that taking a tiff picture with the next model (the dsc-p100) is very time-consuming. Manual settings can be adjusted easily, and this is very good because the light that comes from the built-in flash is nearly as bright as the natural lightning - too much for the subject not to close his eyes at night.", "Date": "August 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "A newbie's perspective", "Author": "Lodge2", "ReviewID": "R2C2GRDWFW8VS2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was my first digital camera, so my perspective is probably a bit prejudiced by my inexperience.  Things I like, and dislike, about this camera are:1.  Easy to use.  You point and push the button.  It does the rest.2.  Virtually unlimited storage capacity.  After you buy a decent size memory chip (i.e. 256MB), then you can get up to 98 pictures at full size or 350+ at a moderate size.  The memory chip that comes with this camera (32MB) will only story the following number of pictuers: 5MP = 12, 3MP = 20, 1MP = 50, VGA = 196.3.  Prices vary wildly for memory.  I bought three memory chips and paid between $57 and $37 for the same product at different locations.  Be sure to shop prices on the net before you buy.4.  Slow shutter.  If you are used to 35mm, then get used to blurry pictures while you learn.  It takes a second for the camera to focus and light levels can have a big effect on clarity.  Also, using some type of support (i.e. tripod) can also greatly increase clarity.5.  Eats batteries quickly.  If you use the camera a lot, it will go through the AA batteries quick.  Luckily, they are rechargeable and are not unique to the camera.  Carry extras.6.  Good low light pictures.  Assuming you use a support, and the subject is stationary, you can take great low light pictures.7.  Don't have to wait for film developing.  You can snap away to your hearts content and then delete all the bad ones later.8.  Easily transfers images to your PC.  It's just a couple of clicks with the mouse.Bottom line - It's an easy to use camera that can take beautiful pictures with amazing clarity.  This assumes you have good lighting, a stationary subject, good support and take multiple frames.  If you try to use this like a point and shoot 35mm, then you will get nothing but blurry, out of focus pictures.Glad I bought it, but it's taken me several thousand pictures to figure out how to get shots that will equal my 35mm SLR.", "Date": "March 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera !", "Author": "robp \"robp\"", "ReviewID": "R1TU6RC4YR3EY7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Compact design, very handy, powers on really quick, takes only 2 AA size batt.Extremely good value for the money-less than 270$ total in one of the online stores (jan/05)Cons: None so far. But it is made in China, My previous camera - Sony DSCP5 was made in Japan! but it is a matter of trust in quality of labor, I guess...Several things if you considering buying this camera:1. To take advantage of shooting movies in Fine mode you need Memory Stick PRO - buy min 512 MB (approx. 85$ on ebay -as of Jan/05) don't settle for a smaller ones, you will buy bigger sooner ot later.2. Invest some extra money in spare NiMH batteries - I got 8 batt + international 1hour charger for 21$ on ebay - I am NOT going to run out of battery power anytime soon :)3. Do not take it out without a case!4. A small tripod (less than 5$ on ebay) allows you to be on your own pictures :)5. Plenty of shooting modes: several preprogrammed, one complete manual (makes you feel like you own a SLR camera) and one total auto - even a toddler can make a picture6. Setup allows you to create folders on MStick and switch between them (as you take the pictures) - pictures are organized before transferring to your PC7. Upgradeable - You can buy e.g. telephoto lens or underwater shooting case8. The only difference between Sony MStick and other brands (SanDisk) is the price !9. It has 1.5\" LCD - the price for being so compact - you need to be comfortable with such a size. If you need strong glasses for reading, look for another model :) Larger LCD usually means bulky camera or extremely costly compact. Larger LCD is also easier to damage...10. Included A/V cable allows you to see the pictures/movies on your TV - GREAT feature!11. Do read the manual, read it also again after you know the basics, you will find something new every time...12.

The pictures are crisp and can be huge allowing you to reduce the size if you want to without compromising photo quality. The lens extends and retracts very fast and taking a photo is very quick. The flash is a bit weak but if you buy the optional flash it will be pretty much more \"professional\". Pictures taken in the dark are a bit hard to line up but this happens with other cameras also.I laugh when I see a thousand cameras at a game all flaring their puny flashes at figures over 50 feet away...hehehe. The camera's aperture can be changed easily allowing shots in darker settings -like fireworks. This camera can be a simple point and click or used with foresight.It took less than ten minutes to plug the included usb connector line into the computer, insert the disk with the driver on it and download the pictures directly into windows xp home version for viewing, storage or editing.Some reviewers here and elsewhere often hold every item to a standard set by Hollywood or by comparing to a fully professional unit. Remember that this is a comsumer camera and it is better than many professional units available in the past. Wonderful photos were taken on tintypes and their resoloution was not all that great..Good photos are in the EYE of the picture taker and the camera should help them realise their goal of capturing what the photographer sees. This Cybershot allows me to take marvelous pictures and the added bonus of video is really a plus-especially for web applications.

You can download drivers, etc. from Sony's site and hook the camera up to your computer through a usb cable.  Very easy.  The batteries last a very long time for me.  Though it has automatic shut-off, it probably depends on how long you keep the camera on trying to figure things out (read the manual first)...or if you leave it on and forget when you have it hooked up to the computer, but if you stay aware of these things you should have excellent battery life.  CONS: Two complaints, and they are the same for any digital camera that I've tried or heard about: I want instant capture when I press that button (like a 35mm), not a three second wait, which is a long time when you're trying to capture children, wildlife, or sports. Also, the color of ordered prints is slightly off 80% of the time.  I don't have time to tweak coloring in hundreds of pictures.  CONCLUSION: However, the pictures are sharp and I can take as many pictures as I want and ease of use is high. The video is nifty too.

It was difficult to make a decision as I had loved the Olympus, but I dropped it on the floor and it was broken. The decision to buy a Sony stemmed from owning rechargable AA batteries and my dad owning a sony memory stick already for an older Sony Mavica.I have had nothing but great pictures with this camera, unless I moved.  Batteries last a long time but the included charger and batteries would have been a better deal if it charged more than two AA batteries at a time.The manual is very easy to follow; there are alot of features in this camera so I refer to it every once in a while to refresh my memory. I mostly use it outdoors with children in my day care in very bright conditions or in florescent lighting and all the pictures are great.I download using the USB cable and Windows XP camera wizard. I only installed the basic software to run the camera, because all the other software is useless.  It doesn't edit the pictures, so I actually edit them on Camedia. I know some people don't like that software either, but on the whole it is easy to use and works well.You won't be sorry if you buy this camera. It is small enough to go anywhere, and will do the job.

I have always taken care of my camera, so I'm not sure how to explain the why, but within the past 6 months it will shut down in picture-taking modes, when there is still enough battery power.  If it doesn't shut down after attempting to take a picture, it will turn on when powered on, the lens will extend, then the camera will die.

Absolutely no trace of purple fringing on high-contrast scenes. No jpeg artifacts to hide the details. Most of the 5 megapixel cameras I have used produce photos that look good when they're reduced to 1280x1024 pixels or so, but when you look at them in full resolution you see blurriness in the details, or fringing around objects. There is absolutely none of that with this camera.Add to that the ease of use and the wealth of exposure controls (full auto, shutter and aperture priority auto, and complete manual, along with a few programmed modes). This may not be a top end camera for the professional photographer, but it is well suited to beginners to serious amateurs.The only caveat I can think of is the digital zoom. This works by effectively cropping the photo, thereby reducing the final image resolution.

I bought this camera in late 2004 because my family was getting ready to take trip to the beautiful country of Nicaragua to visit some family (i'm a halfy, my dad's from Missouri) so i NEEDED to have a camera.  at that time, this camera was the hottest thing you could find for that money, and i bought mine at Best Buy-everythingoverpriced. Anyway, if you're looking for a great, durable camera, this is the one for you.  Countless times i've seen my camera on a tripod fall due lack of brains on my friends' part but some how i never learned my lesson.  Most people don't like the size of this camera but i say other wise.  Why would you want a camera so tiny that it feels like you can crush it in your hands.  On the down side of this camera, after nearly crushing my friends' newer cameras, i fell in love with the LCD that puts this one to shame.  I can literally put my thumb over the screen of this camera. But is screen size really what matters?  This camera contended with cameras today pretty well.  it has an EXCELLENT shutter programer that i found to be more useful than i thought and plenty of mode settings to shoot in all sorts of conditions.  i was very impressed with the macro mode in which i shot many things such flowers, weird bugs and we were fortunate enough to be at the right beach at the right time to see baby sea turtles hatch and make they're way to the ocean. beautiful pictures!if you're not happy with just picture, the video side to this camera is also impressive.  My friends and I took second place at our high school film festival (that actually sounds pretty lame) using this camera.  first place, of course, was a second movie we submitted. the quality of the video is pretty good, depending on what setting you have it on, and USEFUL! if there's ever a moment when pictures just arne't enough, it take little energy and time to switch this camera to video mode. this camera has it all. i highly recommend it.  In December 2007-January 2008, my family and I took another trip to Nicaragua.  I wasn't able to find enough money to buy a nice dslr(i bought a cheap care instead) so i brought along with me my trusty P93. I can honestly say that i took the best pictures that i have ever taken (with out using my dad's Rebel) with that camera.  Sadly, my P93, carrying case, and all 5 memory cards i had bought were all stolen after about a week of being there.  It seriously felt like one of my best friends just moved away with warning. coincidentally, before leaving Nicaragua, I saw a guy that had a brand new P93 and he was as happy as could be.Pros:*VERY STRONG AND DURABLE*comfortable to hold*great shutter programing*doesn't waste batteries quickly*extremely easy to use*unexpectedly good video mode*good sound qualityCons:*some times i wished i had a bigger screen but then you just get over it*\"Only 5.1 megapixels! but i need WAY MORE than that!\" Shut Up! sure this camera only has 5.1, but hey! do you really need that much more for a simple point and shoot.  it never really got in my way too much.*some times the auto mode tries to get ahead of it's self and just freaks out, better off using program modes*i accidentally cover the microphone with my finger some timesi fell in love with this camera", "Date": "February 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "review sony cybershot dscp93 5mpdigital camera with optical zoom", "Author": "mummy \"mummy\"", "ReviewID": "R3AJE0TO6ZOCX7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very good  but rechargabale battery dosnt last long .second drawback is you that picture cannot be enlarged very much. i wish it had  a camera cover.", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Pictures", "Author": "Dream Seeker", "ReviewID": "R2A34GOHUSVMQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for over a year.

It was one of the first 5.1mega pixel models.I have taken easily 100,000 pictures with it.Now, I won't report on what the camera does, as it does everything wonderful, but I can give you a review of how it will fair with a lot of use:1. The batteries need some changing after the one year mark, if you don't, the charge won't hold very long. This is common with all rechargeables. However, I still use my originals.2. Whether it's been dropped one too many times, or in the sand too much, I'm not sure, but I do now have the problem of the camera's shutter not opening automatically when the lens extends. This problem is infrequent.3. As stated in other review, if you don't have enough battery power, the camera will confusingly close the lens and shutter and then immediately extend the lens and open the shutter and turn off in this open mode. The only way around it is to remove the dying batteries when the camera lens first retracts.Okay, the only problems I really have with the camera:1: The 32mb included Sony MemoryStick is way too small. Also, this proprietary format is very expensive compared to other forms of flash storage. Just doesn't cut it in 2006, folks.2: After two years of use, or maybe it's earlier, you MUST reset the camera. If you don't you'll definitely see performance lag. Not a big problem at all.3: It would be nice if you could somehow record those amazing 640x480 resolution MPEGs directly to your computer through the USB cable.4: Finally, it's now 2006. Most cameras come with image stabilization gizmos.If it's 2004, buy the camera. I bought it for $300 even back then. If the price isn't down at least 33% now in 2006, leave it alone. There are much better cameras with better features quality nowadays. Simply put.The DSCP93 was ahead of it's time in 2004. Great features, unheard of resolution, rugged.
