That's what this camera is meant for night time. The focus and zoom are not really helpful. think it doesn't really work. turn zoom dont mess with any of the setting or the picture turn red. Would have return but i need a good night time camera. day time ok.

However, it stopped working in 1 day. I really did not want to have to take it down I tried hooking it up to several different cables, but nothing worked. I filed online claim to have it replaced at Amazon but, I did not get a response from the seller - the distributor of this brand. After a week I contacted them directly and they issued me an RMA and said I had to pay the shipping cost back.  Then I decided to get a camera from someone else.  They issued a refund less the shipping charges to me and said it was fine and complained that I did not return the screws and wall anchors! Would not buy again.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor camera, worse company", "Author": "Roy Coffell", "ReviewID": "R153OCGWP5QJ84", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera has a narrow field of vision even at the setting that gives the widest angle.  I mounted the camera under the overhang on the front of my garage & it didn't offer enough coverage to be of any use.  The $40 Clover camera it replaced was much better.  At night the VideoSecu image was spotted with randomly shaped white patches. The lens was clean so the camera was obviously defective. I removed it, obtained an RMA, and sent it back.  Not only did I have to pay the return shipping, I was also hit with a 15% restocking fee.  How do you \"restock\" a defective camera?  Their return policy apparently is not on Amazon.  Only a message to \"contact\" the seller for information. Why can't they just put it in writing? I've since replaced the VideoSecu camera with a similar model from one of their competitors.  It has an outstanding view angle and good night vision.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$324.95", "Features": "1/3\" PIXIM DPS technology. Ultra Wide Dynamic Range solution.
