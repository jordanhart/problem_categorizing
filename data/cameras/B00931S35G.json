{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Remarkable images from little camera.", "Author": "Douglas Henderson", "ReviewID": "R5CV2UIL73D7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a DP1 Merrill from Adorama during a brief sale a few weeks ago. The camera is small, though a little larger than the earlier DP1s/x Sigma fixed lens cameras.  On the DP1 Merrill, the lens no longer telescopes out when the camera is turned on--so no more risk of flexing vulnerable tape-cables. The battery life is indeed short--but Sigma supplies two batteries.  I've gotten 60 to 70 or more RAW images on a charge from a single battery--by keeping the screen use to a minimum.  The screen can be turned off entirely or used with various duration options.  The camera will simply shut down immediately after being turned on if the battery is too low.Image quality is the reason to wade through any perceived limitations of the camera.  Start up time is quick.  The camera can be turned on without first remembering to remove the lens cap (as required with the DP1s/x). Processing time of files after exposures is what some folks find unsatisfactory--but this is just a few seconds, during which the buffer allows you to take some additional images.  I shoot large-format cameras in the field and the set up time and the darkroom work takes a commitment of time--in comparison (image quality vs standing around), the little DP1 Merrill is a miracle.The amount of well defined detail in enlargements from the files this camera produces is remarkable--more like medium-format film.  The images show nice neutral colors and excellent detail in shade with a seeming unique light to shade relationship/quality on a monitor which is hard to define. The image files show excellent highlight value capture and recovery using Sigma's SPP software (with quite a wide exposure latitude). Excessive underexposure will reveal color noise in the shadows.Good exposures can be had by just a point and shoot approach--I find setting the exposure compensation to +0.3 or +0.7 at 100 iso usually works fine.  I'm not using exposure lock features as often as I tend to do with other cameras.  The ability to quickly alter the exposure compensation is nice--but it's too easy.  The only real snafu I've encountered so far is the exposure compensation button being near the right thumb when the camera is being held--it is much too easy to unconsciously dial the exposure compensation to its +3 F-stop limit.  Either you note the mistake on the screen before taking a photo or you get a white-out image (which the Sigma software will nearly fully recover!).The camera came with 1.01 firmware installed.  Auto focus is prompt and accurate.  I've played with the manual focus feature and it requires some care.  The focus wheel on the lens barrel is fly-by-wire.  If wheeled all the way over toward infinity focus, it sets the lens well beyond the infinity symbol on the view screen scale--and the image will be entirely out of focus.  Setting the marker directly beneath the infinity symbol is necessary--and for old eyes, not so clearly accomplished.  I use manual focus on my other little Sigma DP1s--but with the DP1 Merrill, auto focus is a quick enough, sure thing for landscapes.The lens is excellent. Between the apertures of F5.6 and F8, it's sharp right to the frame of the image.  There is a small amount of chromatic aberration which can now be addressed in Sigma software or another image processing software after the RAW file is converted to TIFF.  There is also purple fringing on bright edges, depending on lighting conditions that seems more than usual, but can be well addressed in Photoshop Raw adjustment features.TIFF files from the Sigma RAW post-processing software come to about 85MB.  If you save double-sized TIFF files, they come to 338MB. The larger files really slow my Mac Mini.  The Sigma software processing, when chewing through the big DP1 Merrill files, is indeed the slowest yet, but with patience, you can get them converted to TIFF files and work further in other software.  Usually all that is required in SPP is a slight adjustment to the color balance, exposure and minor use of Sigma's unique fill feature. I set focus to -0.2 to -0.6--the files are stunningly sharp right from the camera with only minor room for any improvement.  Sigma's SPP 5.4 software isn't included with the camera, but instead downloaded.  For Mac users, the software only works in the Pentium machines.Images shot with the DP1 Merrill, at least mine, do show a slight green shift toward the image margins (less than with my DP1s).  Every Sigma camera I've owned will do this with certain lenses.  I suspect this is a characteristic of the Foveon sensor in context with a wide-angle lens--the outer field of a projected image from the lens falls on the outer margins of the sensor at a steep angle and the stacked individual sensor layers are refracting?/screening out a little of the red light.  Nothing to do but make minor Photoshop repairs, the price for otherwise splendid, easily acquired images.  My copy shows no dust on the sensor.Great lens and sensor in the same small package.  I put the wide-angle view finder from my DP1s on the Merrill and this works to both frame the image and hold the light camera steady against my face.  A 100% enlargement from an 85MB file looks like a wholly intact, sharp photo by itself.  One could make the case that the DP1 Merrill carries within its deep resolution files another camera--equivalent to a Sigma DP2x.UPDATE 12/22/12:  Took the DP1 Merrill to Yellowstone and have two note worthy additions to the above review:1) Greenish cast margins in the images shot yesterday, many in bright snow, are  practically nonexistent--vastly superior to the small DP1s/x cameras I've used (took a DP1s along with the DP1m for comparison).2) Having recharged the battery just three time, there was a spectacular improvement in battery life yesterday--I got 162 RAW file images on one battery from the DP1 Merrill using it in the field.  The battery symbol was showing depletion coming (empty of green squares), but the sun went down before I ran out of power.Point and shoot with auto focus, 100 iso and +0.3 exposure compensation between F5.6 and F7.1 works perfectly for both dim and exceedingly bright light conditions.

Raper", "ReviewID": "R5NPTH05U2IP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want a real, modern camera, don't bother with this one.  By all contemporary standards it's a lousy camera, and a pain in the butt to use.  Lousy battery life, slow processing, crummy autofocus, lousy low light performance, only really any good at ISO 100-200.  It exists for one reason only: the image quality capable form the Foveon sensor and the superb lens.  Be it 15 or 45 MP, makes no difference. Put it on a tripod, shoot it in decent light at ISO 100, make an 11 x 14 print from this camera and any current DSLR, no matter what the megapixel count, and compare the two and you will see what I mean.I own several other cameras - a Sony NEX 6, Canon G1x, a Nikon D300s with a 17-35 zoom.  The Sigma IQ puts them all to shame.  While I would never carry it out into the field as my only camera, it always comes along with whichever of the others I take, and if I see that special shot, out comes the Sigma.So if you can put up with a camera whose solo attribute is outstanding IQ within a limited area this is the one.  If you want it for sports, action, kids photos, high ISO work, street, even portraits, look elsewhere.  It's probably best as a landscape shooter.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Game-Changer", "Author": "Mel R. Scurbica", "ReviewID": "R8RBM7I5WTKFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Nikon D200 camera with a lot of lenses and a Nikon Coolpix P7700. The Coolpix took better photos than the D200. In order to get a Nikon DSLR with the quality that I wanted, it would cost me thousands of dollars that I can't afford. So I came up with two plans:* In plan A, I would sell all my DSLR gear, buy a DP-1 Merrill and pocket $1,000. In this scenario, I'd keep the Coolpix to use as a general shooter for times when I want to take family photos, and use the Sigma for landscapes and other outdoor photography.* In plan B, I would sell all my Nikon gear, including the Coolpix, and buy a Sony DSC-RX100 II. In this scenario, I'd use the Sony for everything and wind up with maybe an additional $100 or $200 in my pocket over plan A.I weighed the pros and cons over pretty carefully. In the end, the Sigma kept calling to me. So I went to Plan A.Before I go any further, let me say that I am completely happy that I bought this camera. Now...If you are looking for an all-around camera that you can use to take nice outdoor photos and also use for things like indoor family photos in low light, grandma blowing out the birthday cake, and fast-moving sports photography where you can bang off a series of shots, then DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. You will not be happy.If you primarily shoot in daylight, are looking for a camera that has an incredible sensor that rivals cameras that sell for more than five times the price, don't mind bringing a few extra batteries along, and aren't going to whine that you can't do RAW conversions in Lightroom or Photoshop, this is the camera for you.Frankly, I am amazed by this camera. Right off the bat, you need to know that the camera eats batteries because it needs the juice to process the super-high resolution images. It is not a camera that you can use to take a quick succession of photos with, because it has to write large files to the memory card. Having said that, I have not noticed any issues with having to wait for the camera before I could shoot again because of the nature of they way that I shoot. I'll say it again: you can't use this camera to shoot a rapid succession of images.Think of this camera they way you'd think of a 4 x 5 view camera and you'll be happy with it. If you think of it as a snapshot camera, you'll want your money back.I had been using the D200 to shoot RAW. Even using RAW, photographing a high-contrast scene meant that the highlights would blow out to the point where they weren't recoverable. Photos taken with the D200 were noisy, even at low ISOs.I just did some test shooting with the Sigma, and I can't believe it. Shooting in the early afternoon glaring summer light, in a high contrast situation where there was shadow and white objects, the sensor on this beast was able to record all of it. I didn't think it was possible. It is amazing.The criticism that this camera is an unergonomic brick is completely valid. However, do a search for Richard Franiec and you'll find his website. This guy sells a $37 custom grip for the Sigma DP1/DP2/DP3 Merrill that transforms the camera into a new camera that fits your hand. This grip doesn't add bulk and it looks exactly like the material the camera is made of. You will love it. (I have nothing to do with this guy or his company. I'm a customer.)The one complaint that I have with the camera is there is fringing evident from the lens. But you can deal with that in post-processing.So, if you know what you're getting into with this camera, you'll be happy you bought it.You can see a few of my images in the customer image gallery. They're the ones of the gazebo and the park area with the trellises.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sharp, but flat and slow", "Author": "Llewellyn Bradford", "ReviewID": "R2T3ITDNUB0I1R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you value sharpness, texture, and detail over luminance, color, and flexibility -  then this is a great camera.  Otherwise, I'd recommend another camera.I tested this camera for a while, but ultimately returned it and got a used Canon 5d (Mark i/classic).  The Sigma delivered amazingly detailed photos of indoor scenes (especially interior shots of historical buildings, etc.) and other scenes where texture is important (backlit flakes of snow on a snowfield) - it was as if you could run your hands over a piece of wood paneling 100 feet away, or read the contours of a snowdrift a hundred feet away.  It's also very small and lightweight.However, I predominantly shoot landscape photography, and although it's a great camera for capturing details of tree branches, blades of grass, etc... it seems to achieve this at the expense of capturing the quality of light that's falling on these objects.  Overall, the effect is similar to that of over-applying a sharpening filter in post-production, in my eyes.  Maybe that's what you're looking for (especially in architectural photography, perhaps), but when you're trying to capture the ethereal essence of sunset on Mount Rainier, or the depth of a bluebird summer sky - this camera seems to render everything rather flat and lifeless, compared to my Canon 5d classic.  Even after trying to equalize the photos in post-production, I couldn't coax any life out of the Sigma photos (and yes, they were processed with the clumsy Sigma RAW converter).Also, WARNING!!! - photos shot directly into the sun will have a rather unique lens flare: essentially a large field of multicolored circles, because of the nature of the Sigma's unique multi-layered sensor (I believe the Fuji X-trans sensor exhibits a similar effect).  This was the biggest dealbreaker for me, since I shoot landscapes, and often wind up with the sun directly in the frame.  Also, you have to buy a pocketful of batteries to get you through a large shoot.Although the 28mm equivalent lens is a nice length, I couldn't justify its price vs. a full-frame DSLR which lets you put any number of lenses on it (personally, I recommend vintage Olympus OM Zuiko lenses, which are a great deal if you don't mind manual exposures).  Additionally, the number of accessories available is pretty small, and thus, expensive (i.e. grips, L-brackets, cases, lens hoods, etc.).So, I don't recommend this as a landscape photography camera, despite its small size (for the same size and portability, I'd go with a Fuji X100, otherwise get a used full-frame camera).  But it could be a great architectural photography camera, or other use where capturing detail is essential and battery life isn't essential (and you don't mind spending extra time converting the RAW files in Sigma's software, since the JPEGs are horrible).", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Difficult Camera to Characterize ...", "Author": "M. Boehm", "ReviewID": "R1ZLGBJ31W3Z90", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm giving this camera 5 stars because I was an educated buyer, knowing what was in store so-to-speak. My original DP1 Stopped working one day, the focusing just quit. I called Sigma in New York and after talking to them for a few minutes was rather astonished that they had a trade-up program for my DP1 to the DP1M, and yes they knew the old one was broken. I would rather not say how much the credit was...but it was quite substantial, nearly equal to what I paid for the DP1 in the first place. I sent the old camera back and after they received it I received a call from them. I was directed how to pay the price difference on the website and the new one was sent out via UPS Ground. Sooo...I now have the camera. What do I think? It's heavier & larger than the DP1, better made, and faster. It is great that new lens doesn't retract every time I turn the camera on and off like the old one did. The 2.8 Max Aperture makes a HUGE difference over the old  4.0 one. The camera drains batteries way too fast. Many people are buying Ricoh Camera batteries out of Hong Kong for $3-4 each and shaving the corners off with a razor blade, rather than paying Sigma $40 ...it's pretty well accepted that you need at least 6 batteries with you at all times (I'm quite serious. This camera ships with 2 batteries (beyond unusual) and there is a very good reason for this. The pathetic little built-in flash of the DP1 is gone. Photoshop, Lightroom, and Mac OS X do not support the raw files that this camera generates, who knows if they ever will. There is a ultra simple to use 'hack\" of OS X that will allow you to preview the raw files using your space bar just like any other picture file...this \"hack\" also allows you to have Icon Image previews of the Sigma Raw Files...Google it..it's super easy to install. The Sigma Photo Pro software from Sigma that you must use to work with the raw images (you never want to shoot anything but raw on this camera) is mostly JUNK, it crashes if you look at it wrong, but if you are patient..and this is the keyword, you will obtain image quality you simply can't get...anwyhere else..period..especially for anything approaching this price range..or several times it. The Image Quality is why you purchase this camera, the images make everything else that you <think> is good...look really really bad. Whether on screen or printed..the amount of detail is stunning. Remember though...the essential reality of this camera is that it is an ISO100-200 max, daylight camera that should always be left in Raw Mode. As to whether or not it is a 15mp or a 46mp camera...my answer is \"yes\"... yes it is. In other words, it might not be a 46mp camera...but no mere 15mp camera can even come close to providing you with the beautiful detail this thing generates. If you want better image quality than anything Sony (including the RX1), Fuji, and arguably Leica (M9), etc.. provides, go with this camera...your patience will be rewarded.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "The image quality will BLOW out of your mind", "Author": "Chuang Jojo", "ReviewID": "R2JOM8H66PEG2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you interested in Sigma's camera, you probably know the different between it and a normal bayer base camera.The Foven sensor could give you incomparable sharp quality, detail and color when you deal with the RAW file.The ISO is always the weak part of Foven sensor, make sure to bring a tripod (or even flash) with you.The DP1 merrill came with a 19mm f2.8 wide range lens (28mm when transfer in 35mm film)Compare with DP2 merrill, which is a 30 mm f2.8 (45mm when transfer in 35mm film) Dp1 has wider view and is perfect for landscape photo shooting, but the image quality on corner is not as good as center. The \"purple edge\" and \"green edge\" problem will occur, which happens often with wide range lens. Make sure to look it up before you buy. But it's still a good wide range lens.The electronic system is way more improved from it's former model, makes it easier to handle. And can enjoy your photo shooting in a slow pace (thinks it as the 35mm film camera)The only problem with it is the battery. You will need a lot of battery for it.DP Merrill series are BATTERY MONSTER. They will dry the battery extremely fast.

Hung", "ReviewID": "R2FK6S7NG4TEJU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually bought this camera refurbished from Sigma online outlet store over the Black Friday weekend. It was going for $636 without tax and shipping fee. When I received the package, I was ecstatic to find out that Sigma had sent me a brand new camera with full 1-year warranty instead of 90-days.Now back to the review of this camera. I own a Canon 5D Mark3 and 7D. I can attest none of these cameras with the best L lenses slapped on them would come close to the resolving power of this little gem. I also own a used DP2s and I knew how bad it was in terms of focusing and ergonomics. It 's not really that bad considering the quality of the images I got from the DP2s, I could live with all its quirks. So I had a relatively low expectation when I bought this camera. I knew I wanted a DP1 Merrill for its focal length because I could use it for landscape and streets. My Canon 5D Mark3 with the EF 24mm F1.4L II comes really close in resolving power at low ISO. Forget about high ISO, any camera out in today's market would blow the DP series away. This camera is not for everybody and you know it. My wife didn't understand and she thought I had too many cameras already. But when I blow up the captured images on a large print, she would know what I was talking about. Yeah, if you are not pixel-peeping or making large prints. Go get something else. This camera is not perfect but it has exceeded my expectation. Hence I gave it four stars.If you want near medium format quality in a small form factor, look no further.

I was solely interested in the best IQ at base ISO ... that's it ... not ergonomics, size, AF speed, buffer clearing, LCD clarity in daylight. IQ, IQ, IQ - tones, natural colors, subtle gradations, great ability to convert to monochrome, etc! My goal is to have a camera with me all the time for fine-art, stock and many other personal photo ops.I already own a Sony Experia Z phone with a camera that is excellent for quick snaps and video meant to send to friends, family or posting on FaceBook. For my professional wedding, portrait, event, and most other paid jobs, I use my Sony A700 with prime fast lens, vertical grip, and professional flash.At first, I bought the Ricoh GR and as with prior models, loved its ergonomics, size and UI. Even the IQ compared with prior models is fantastic given the APS-C sized 16.2MP sensor. But, quickly I realized that I had redundancy in my gear - my phone, GR and A700 are all Bayer sensor cameras.Then I saw Amazon had the DP1 Merrill for $699 via Beach Camera. While I still had the GR, I just had to order the DP1M to see how the new 15x3MP sensor captured (I previously have owned other older 5x3MP DP models but the interpolation required to increase the size of the files at least to me negated the advantages of the Foveon sharpness and subtleties).Anyway ... enough of my disclaimers  ... the Sigma DP1 Merrill lives up to the hype.

It has the perfect depth for a nice landscape photo camera. Like others have said before, it is terrible under low light, higher exposure time, poor battery life, poor recall time for the just-shot-image. Sigma even provides an additional battery for the poor battery life. Getting a fast SD card doesnot seem to help. It may be because each of the file is humongous and the foveon sensor does a lot of processing on camera; the TIFFs tend to be 100 MBs or so (a crude approximator of the clarity that is being stored, compared to the 20-30 MB of a 5D mk3 RAW).But then there is the flipside, the images that you get out of this camera are just too crisp and almost 3D like. Many a times it even sometimes puts my 5D mk3 with an L lens to shame. The image quality (i would rather say the details) with the sigma is amazing: i feel like a detective in a CSI episode, as i can do an almost infinite zoom :)The software that comes with the camera is worthless.
