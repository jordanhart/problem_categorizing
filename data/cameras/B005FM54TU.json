I thought this would be a good replacement since it has 14 MP and it shares the similar traits as the previous one. However, this one is slower: shutter speed, deleting photos, etc. Slow and small! My 10 MP camera was slightly bigger than this one. It seems more like a novelty toy camera instead of something you can depend on long term.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$129.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Kodak EasyShare M23 14 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PjDEcpfLL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005FM54TU"}}
