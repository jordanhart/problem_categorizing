And dabbled in old 35mm film cameras recently.  I decided it was time to step up to a DSLR and having seen a brief piece in Consumers Reports about the Rebel SL1 I had to have one.  The camera and lenses are exactly what I wanted.  Compact, feature rich and easy to use taking great stills. I haven't tried the video capability yet.  I have a nice, small HD video camera for that which was my favorite camera til I got this little gem.The ability to chose between the camera doing all the settings work and the user choosing their settings makes this camera fun to use like my manual 35 MM's.  The huge difference being you get to see the result immediately vs. having to wait for the (now rather expensive) film to be developed.A very nice camera indeed!", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lightweight, powerful and amazing", "Author": "Emerson R. de Mello", "ReviewID": "R220W0YLLVNR4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon SL1 is fantastic.

Robbins", "ReviewID": "R1K0EPBXVD17PE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great size/features/picture quality combination - exactly what I wanted.  I would imagine I could have spent $1000 more on a different model and really all that I would have noticed (at least for 95% of the shots we will take) is that the camera itself was bigger\u2026 not that any other features are \"lost\" on this SL1 just because Canon figured out how to slim it down impressively.Autofocus works quickly and the telephoto lens (55-250mm Image Stablized) is a must for anyone (even beginners) who will take pictures at any little league sporting event\u2026 the pics look great and the camera is quick enough to catch the action!", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "R31GA9F87SUTEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera for the price I would fully recommend this camera.

The camera gets a 5 star rating.The reason for the 4 star rating is that the zoom lens did not arrive in original Canon box and did not come with a manufacturers warranty card. It is a Canon lens and functions properly. I'm assuming it is grey market/imported.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great compact design with full features", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R3JOLPVZGF5OZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my girlfriend because she was ready to step up to a full DSLR.  She didn't want a full size camera and lens to carry.  This camera is perfect.  Pictures are beautiful and the camera is easy to use.

I did not think I would like the touch screen . I was so wrong. It is the best.  I can touch the screen where I want the focus and it is done.  Super!  The. Weight difference is very significant for me.  My son will inherit my XSI, which is a great camera.

It has amazing capabilities, and so far (I don't know that much about how to use it), but from the short time I have had it, I have learned so much!  I love how I can use autofocus and have the camera do all the work, but also have the capability to set my own aperture, etc.  I cannot wait to take outdoor pics with this, and I hope it snows this year, so I can get some pretty winter shots.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Small Camera", "Author": "Tim Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3OT85Z3H5X1VN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The size is perfect for travel.

Image stability is crucial to me as I rarely use a tripod.I also have Sony, Nikon and Olympus cameras for comparison.  I have yet to put the new SL1 to a good test but found very clear images so far.One feature I like is the touch screen.
