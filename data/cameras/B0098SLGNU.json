{"Reviews": [{"Title": "D3200 is Nikon at it's Best!", "Author": "tommydoc99", "ReviewID": "RWQ118M7KY0AA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently ordered a new red D3200 with a two lens bundle including the standard 18-55mm VR and optional 55-300mm VR zoom/telephoto. At a little under $900.00 it wasn't cheap, but wasn't overly expensive either. It replaced my D3100 and hasn't disappointed! Light and quick are both words that come to mind... Having the owner's guide preset on the viewer is handy. The only appreciable disappointment is that the wi-fi feature is limited to operating systems on smart phones and newer tablets, but not any standard windows applications such as Win8 which my laptop is pre-loaded with. So it's back to the good ol' usb hardwire just like all the older models. Another quirk is that the data cable is proprietary to Nikon, thus no stopping by for a replacement at the local discount chain store. The red body is absolutely gorgeous to boot! So if you're in the market for a camera with this set of features, definitely check out a red one! This is the fourth Nikon I've owned and it's the best of the bunch.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Catching the sensation.
