{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good digital camera, but not an upgrade.", "Author": "Jason Cox", "ReviewID": "R8HSO3MOLNNSA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Here are the great features of this camera: * Easy for point and shoot. * Very light and small!  It easily fits in your pocket. * Great full color LCD viewscreen and easy to understand buttons. * Wonderful shutter button and \"video record\" buttons (some cameras require you to twist knobs, pull levers and shift gears to go from picture taking to video recording, this camera makes it a snap!) * Video Recording will fill up all the space you have.  With a 1GB SD card, it will record nearly 90 minutes of video.  The video is decent quality (the QVGA 30fps mpeg) and has allowed us to stop taking the bulky 8mm video camera along with us.  With Windows Movie Maker software, we can easily mix still photos and live videos for sharing with friends on the web or burn to DVD.  It is NOT digital video recorder quality (or even an 8mm) but when you are juggling the kids, keys, diaper bags, towels, and everything else, if you can eliminate a camera and still have the functionality, life is good!Our first digital camera was an HP Photosmart 735.  We purchased the M407 as a replacement.  The price and features seemed to make it equal with the 735 but with some enhancements.  However, that is not entirely true.* Strange as it may seem, the 4 MB Best selection doesn't seem to produce the same crystal clear vibrant colors that the 3.2 megapixel 735 did.  The flash seems to make this even worse.* The camera does not have a speaker.  It has a mic to record video and audio-over, but you can't play it back and listen to it.  You must transfer it to your computer.  The 735 came with a built in speaker which made it a great way to check audio quality as well as the picture.  I am sad that HP didn't continue that with this camera.* As with the 735, you still can't operate the zoom when you are recording.  This is annoying, but you can work around it.  Zoom before you start video recording and it will record at that zoom level (just remember that you can't change it until you stop recording).* The video recording sound is a little soft.  The 735 had an aggressive auto level control that often went overboard, but you never missed audio.  The M407 gives \"cleaner\" audio but at the cost of low levels.  I don't know what is best.*  HP eliminated the simple LCD screen that was on the top of the 735 camera that would show the number of pictures left (or minutes left for video recording) which was a nice feature but not critical.* The view finder is very small and you will probably use the LCD screen instead to frame your shots.  The screen is a bit slow (as with other HP cameras).Overall, it is an excellent camera for the money, but don't expect to see it as an upgrade from the older 3.2M 735 model.", "Date": "December 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Price and easy to use", "Author": "HeLo76", "ReviewID": "R32GGFDIDXFTBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera and I couldn't be happier.

We love it, although I did lose a bunch of pictures from my son's first Christmas.

Not a problem at all if you plan for it.  I have small children and pets, and I missed as many shots with this camera as I did with my very fast film camera.It's very compact, and contrary to what others have said, I got it with everything that's \"in the box.\"  Maybe because I got it from another retailer.

I purchased the first about a year ago and have used it in the Wilds of Idaho taking pictures in all kinds of weather at every elevation imaginable. All the pictures have turned out great. I recently had a reason to take more pictures indoors, new grand daughter. Again the pictures have been fantastic, have had several blown to 11X17 for matting and framing, great quality. I would make several suggestion to folks, buy digital camera batteries, every camera I have owned eats batteries, this HP is no different. If you spend the money and get good quality batteries they will last!  Second recommendation get a SD Memory card, if you are like me you will not be happy with the interanl memory and want to take lots of pictures.  So, this photographer says you can't beat the price, for the quality and service you get from HP. I forgot to mention I had a camera that didn't work, and HP replaced within 2 days with a new one, no questions asked. Good Service goes a long way in my book.

So no longer do you have to filp through books.* Tech support was fast.* supports many different other different languages.* You can connect drectly to your printer... IF it suppots pictbridge or HP instant share* very simple to use-------------------------------------------The bad part about this cameral.* You have to use lithium or NiMH batterys. Alkaline batterys only gives you 4 shots.* some pictures are a bit darker than usuall.* Not a great idea to bring to the beach or almost any were. My cameral got sand into the lens and the moving parts inside. So when I ever turn it on, you will hear a cracking nosies. Also, after a few hits on the ground the screws starts to comeout. HP said that they can't replace the screws because they said they don't make the screws.*Not compatiable with other HP hardware like my HP scanjet 4600,and HP Laserjet 3015. But they did reless updates for that problems.* There is no battery indicator. They only show when the battery is very low.* They install too many differnt othere HP software that I dont need.* No speakers for you to listen back your viedos.* The resolution of the viedos are horriable.* We don't need 3 flash in one picture, do we?* A bit more thick than you expected from the pictures.* This a big battery sucker even if you use rechargeable or lithium batterys.* you have to buy there HP dock to watch your viedos on the tv (which will cost you about $50) note: the dock charges the battery very slowly, so go to radio shack and buy your self a fast charger.* the mic. hardly picks up anything* no steady shot if your hands are shacking so much from you freazing.* i dont really use instant share because ink is just too expensive. Thats why I have a laser printer. But my pictures are only black and white. So thats why I send them to Snapfish and tell them to print them. Only 12 cents per print, can't beat that.Overall I give this a 4 because HP tech support does help in a language that you ACTUALLY understand. The cameral is very simple for anyone to use even if you don't speak engulish.

My son has taken many pictures of his friends -- many indoors at his school and none of those pics are blurred or out of focus. The prints are very nice as well.I bought the camera on a whim because of the price.  I'm glad I did not read the reviews before purchase or I might not have taken that chance even for $80!  We were pleasantly surprised with our results and decided to keep the camera.The menu is intuitive and fun.  This camera has a small internal memory.  I have never had an internal memory in a digital camera before as my other cameras only have a removable memory card option.  The internal memory was kind of sweet!Also, I like that we can use regular batteries because we can pop in the regular ones if in a pinch (although it is obvious those will not last long in any digital camera).Movies are okay to good if your lighting is good - or if you are outdoors - but this camera had not faired as well with night shots.This is an entry level camera and it can provide decent pictures but may not be for everyone.  The picture quality seems to falter when using the digital zoom so we use this camera mainly for point and shoot pictures.  I have had a few decent pics with zoom but not many, it is hard.  It was inexpensive enough that I don't worry about my kids taking it everywhere and reliable enough that everyone is happy with their results.

ALL of my shots were very good.  Normally, I use an 8MP digital SLR which is not a comparable camera by any means and I was still happy with the HP results.

There is one issue that is a bit dissappointing... flash quality. The pictures taken without flash are great, just see the customer images. But, you can't take photos in the dark, because the flash is awful. Why? The pictures are of horrible quality! The fuzz is not just easily shown on the LCD, but on the computer, you'll not see anything but fuzz! The video is even worse. There are green spots and fuzz over everything. The videos don't have flash, so the video option is basically useless. Both with and without flash. The videos on my Sony are crystal clear, even on a big, 17\" monitor. The picture quality on my Sony is WAY BETTER THAN THIS HP, ESPECIALLY ON FLASH! I even did a test on photos and took a picture in flash and without flash on both cameras.

This camera is one of the best buys around among cameras with greater than 4 megepixels and while there are better cameras on the market, this is a very nice one for the money.My favorite qualities of this camera are its size, its ease of use, and its sharp resolution. Pictures can be taken in VGA (lowest quality) or in 2 MP or 4MP resolution. These higher resolutions are going to eat up more memory but they produce sharp, clear photos. For everyday picture taking, I have found the VGA to be just fine, but for someone who is more experienced as a photographer, the 4 MP setting is needed to produce the sharpest images. The ones you get with this camera at that resolution level are very good, but you need to keep in mind that the memory (without buying a memory card) is capable of storing only about 10 images at this level. Lower the quality to VGA, and you can store about 160 images.Some of the disadvantages of this camera include its video capabilities and the placement of certain buttons and controls. The video is offered with an MPEG format and it produces images at 30 frames per second. Its quality isn't very good and I recommend it only to people who really need/want to take a video and have no other alternative. I don't like the placement of the video and picture shutters on the top of the camera either. The picture button is larger than the video shutter, like it should be since it is used more frequently. But the picture shutter is placed to the left of the video shutter on the top of the camera. The picture shutter is used more and it should be on the right side because, to most people, your instinct is to press the button furthest to the right. I cannot count the number of times I have accidentally pressed the video button by mistake.This camera comes with batteries, two USB cables, a strap, a user manual, and HP image software. This software is nice because it helps new photographers organize pictures and upload them into a pc. The other additions are expected with a digital camera but they help aid in the usability of this electronic device.Overall, HP Photosmart is a good digital camera for the money and it is one of the few that offers more than 4 megapixels at such a low price.

The lens that a camera uses is just as important (if not more important) as the megapixels and unfortunately this camera, despite being 4.0 megapixels does not take pictures that are any better than my 3 year old Kodak 2.0 megapixel camera with a Retinar lens.Most of the pictures that you take with the HP photosmart m407 do not have very bright colors and do not stand out in any way.  I find that I spend a lot of time correcting the pictures on my computer so that they will even be worth developing.  I very rarely had to do that with my old Kodak.  Granted I can blow up the pictures to 8x10 and maybe higher with the HP (the 2.0 megapixel Kodak was only good for upto 5x7) but the fact remains that if the picture is not very good then you would not want to blow it up that large to begin with.", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "was a good camera", "Author": "T.

We took it on vacation in July of '05 and the LCD screen blacked out a few days into our vacation. I called HP and was informed that a RECONDITIONED (used) camera was all that I could get. The camera was still under the manufacturers' warranty, but their policy was to replace it with a used camera, not a new one. I had to settle for the \"reconditioned\" camera.  It has been OK since then. HP's customer service is at best mediocre. There are the usual annoying and seemingly endless voice prompts in order to get to an actual service rep, and since HP has out-sourced all of its tech support to the third world, I had a hard time understanding the reps I spoke to. This camera also eats a ton of batteries and takes a few seconds to engage after depressing the button, which is annoying if you're trying to photograph anything other than a posed shot.

To summarize: this is not a very good camera...at all.I first saw this camera at staples and being one of the cheapest cameras drawled me into purchasing.  All I really wanted was a simple point and shoot camera and I believed that HP could handle that.  I was mistaken.* This camera eats batteries even with the LCD screen off* The pictures are almost always blurry/soft even with shutter at max - I almost never get a good sharp picture* It has a slow start up and very slow write and read* Video is awful, both in video and sound - plus no speaker* Too many menus make it very confusing and time consumingThe only thing that I liked about it was the simple fact that it took SD cards which isn't saying very much.  Also, this camera brakes very easily.  I put a small force on the extended lens and it jammed and refused to retract.  I was also talking to someone with the same camera that said they returned theirs 4 times for the exact same reason.I am very displeased with this camera and do not recommend it in the least bid.
