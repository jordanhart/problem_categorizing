It offers different video quality settings and some optimized ofr youtube. ALso, the burst feature is amazin, yesterday I tok a burst of 35 photos in the space of 5 seconds! Amazing.....First off, I own several \"digital\" cameras and have also previously had a few long zoom cameras.I don't like \"big\" cameras because I don't like lugging them around. So when I have owned long zoom cameras in the past, though I have liked them, tended to not use them much because I didn't like carrying them around, thus always ended up selling them.I have been keeping an eye out for a small point and shoot with a 20+ optical zoom and stumbled upon this one by chance on the Olympus web-site.I was impressed by what I saw, read a few reviews and ordered it off amazon.com (of course!) and received it the very next day. Right out of the box, the quality of the build stood out, it was also well laid out and I was delighted to find the battery was almost fully charged.I headed over to a nearby park and snapped off some photos and a few video clips.The quality of the photos and video were excellent, I used some of the \"magic\" settings which are special effects, I usually dismiss these types of effects as gimmicks but found some of them to be impressive.PlusesThe photos have really nice colors and look very life-like (which is what a camera should be capable of!)The zoom is quiet and smoothZoom works with HD and sound (the SP800UZ did not and went straight back!)You can take photos while shooting HD video (though not sure yet where it saves them)It can shoot HD video and say, 480 x 640  video (great for youtube etc or emailing)  at the same time which is very impressive.Super Panoramic mode, best I have seen yet.It has a lot of features, easy for beginnersTakes 3D photos (didn't realize it could until I got it...more icing on the cake lolMinusesNo Printed manual,you really need one for this camera, even though it is easy for beginners, some features are pretty advanced.All the promotional material keep saying YOUTUBE! yet so far I have not found any feature directly related to it (if you have please post a comment)This is a very well built camera, meant to last with some features that are very advanced. If you are looking for a long zoom, with HD video capability and good quality prints, this is for you, the icing on the cake is all the other amazing features you get! I have taken a few pic's in 3D but have not done anything with them. I will do an update when I have used the camera a bit more. Oh and I love the gunmetal gray color!For such a small camera, I am very impressed!", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty Solid Point and Shoot", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R22ANZBRKO9HCF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about a week now and so far I am very satisfied.  I got this camera because I don't like caring around my digital camera for photos and my HD Camcorder for video.  While this is in no way a complete replacement for my Digital SLR and my HD Camcorder, it does the job well quite well and is well worth having an all in one in my pocket.  I will still use my stand alone devices for those planned events when I want the very best.  For general day to day shots of family and fun times it is perfect and at a fair price.PROS:You can operate the zoom while shooting video.  Not all cameras do this.You can take full res snap shots while recording video. Again, the Multi-Recording is why I bought this.You can shoot multi sized photos or videos simultaneously.  This is great for a having a lower res copy ready for upload instantly.The zoom is 24x optical and it fits in my pocket.  The speed of the glass is very good considering the focal range of this unit.You can capture about 29 minutes continuos video at full 1080 (4GB limit on file size for SD cards)I was concerned about not having a view finder, but so far I can see the display well enough in daylight.CONSThe noise of the zoom and auto-focus motor is picked up when recording video, not very noticeable when there are other sounds being recorded, but very noticeable when there's relative silence.(my old canon camera produced a constant high pitch whine throughout all videos.  This is only when zooming and focus and less noticable.(Again, this is not a true replcement for a dedicated camcorder.)There seems to be a 2 snapshot limit of still pics while recording video.  I'm not certain if that is a setting I can change or what the deal is.  Even if it is just 2, that's workable for me.  I would typically be taking stills and then decide to have video as well, which this camera makes effortless to do.  There's a dedicated record button and off you go.Some pics will have \"soft\" details when viewed close up at full res.  This is fairly common though on most point and shoots. (Again, not a true replacement of high DSLR)  However, most shots can have nice sharp detail when you take some time to properly compose the shot.Maybe this is just me, but I always think that if something feels heavy it's built better.  This feels too light in that regard, but like I said, maybe that's just me.  :)I highly reccomend this for the reasons and purpose that I have stated using it for.  All cameras have some drawbacks, but none of those I listed prohibit me from reccomending it.  They are relatively minor considering.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm a happy boy!", "Author": "Charles Kirchhoff \"skikir\"", "ReviewID": "R3RL7PPADKFA5T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This going to be a quick and dirty review.  I got this camera just over a week ago to replace my Canon A720IS.  My Canon is a great camera and gives great shots and is solid as a rock.  All the paint is warn off all the edges from accompanying me on hunting, camping, traveling and daily use. But I had a family todo and wanted a long zoom and HD video.  I spent a lot of time checking out cameras from Sony, Nikon, Panasonic, Canon and others and none had everything I wanted.  Then at the last minute I found the SZ-30mr.  It was so new I could not find any hands on reviews but it had everything I was looking for and took a leap of faith, bared my credit card and bought it.  I was not disappointed.  I was so busy before traveling for a wedding/reunion for which I bought this camera for, I did not get a chance to learn it.  However, it was not that difficult. And I was able master it enough to get the job done.  I bought a 16 gig SD card, a spare battery and external charger.  I like the external charger since it does not take the camera out of action during charging. Plus the cable is propitiatory and makes it one more thing to carry and get lost and does not work with anything else.  I spent a week traveling for a wedding/family reunion and took tons of pictures and videos. Every morning I would change the battery. I was able to video 90 percent of the time of a wedding ceremony at full 1080i and take full resolution 16 megapixel stills at the same time as well as taking many videos and stills at the reception before the battery gave out and of course like an idiot I left the spare battery in the charger!  But by that that time toasts had been made, cakes were cut and dances were made and anything I did miss was not important.  I'm a picture taking fool so for most anyone else I think battery life is fine.  In just over a week of heavy use I took just over 5 GIG of video and images.  I have not had time to analyze in any quantitative way to the quality of the images since I've been back BUT by just reviewing them on my net book on the road and on a 47\" HD TV at the resort, using an external HDMI cable from the camera, the pictures look great and the HD videos are impressive.  OH, Oh, the panorama mode is absolutely fantastic!  Just sweep across the scene and your done.  And panorama play back from the camera is great.  Which brings up playback using the camera.  By hooking up a \"D\" type HDMI cable ($29 from Radio Shack) you can play back pictures and videos to a HD TV.  At home I discovered my Panasonic TV remote would control the playback, at the resort I could not get the remote to work so I had to use the camera controls manually but better than nothing and it was fun reviewing the event with the family while there.  It was nice not to have to carry my big laptop and cables and setups to play back images.  Another fun thing we did is we had the family movies from the 40s and 50s placed on DVD and while there at the reunion we watched it.  While my older brother and sister narrated and made comments of where and who were in the silent movie I videoed the video and recorded their comments.  I plan on taking the sound track from my video and add it to the silent movies on the DVD.  This way I we can preserve so much that would have been lost.  I would never have know that little old lady in the movie was my Great Great grand mother if my brother and sister had not pointed her out!  I was able to record over an hour and fifteen minutes of continuous recording.  It was at a lower resolution but all I waned was the audio and the some video to make sure I get it synced properly.  The camera is pretty responsive.  Some comment on the wait time between pictures but remember people, your dealing with 16 megapixels!  You really need a class 10 SD card to speed up the storage time.  Cut that back to 8MP and cycle time is much faster.  The wide angle is perfect for the indoor group shots.  Let's be frank, no one in their right mind has the right to take 600mm telephoto shots hand held.  However on a sunny day with the ISO kicked up I was able to get some impressive results just seeing what I could do with it.  I believe many people don't know how to take pictures and just mash down the button like a cheap Instamatic without pausing in the intermediate position long enough to allow the camera time to focus giving blurry images.  If the exposure button is used properly this camera gives excellent results.  The only beefs I have with this camera are minor.  The biggest problem is the Mode dial moves too easily.  Every time I pulled it out of my pocket I had to check the mode because it get changed so easily.  It needs to be either harder to turn or have some kind of locking device.  Also, the markings are hard to read if you are far sighted with out reading glasses.  It would be nice to have it labled in multi colors so you don't have to put on your glasses to know where your at.  Another comment is the bezel ring around the closed lens has a edge on it that is sharp and does not feel good and drags on the fabric of the pocket when pulling out.  I may take some sandpaper and smooth that out.  The last issue I have is the finish on the camera.  I like to take candid pictures with out having people freezing up and not acting normal or those with camera phobia covering their faces or turning away when a camera is brought out.  The finish on this camera is very shinny and chrome like.  This thing sparkles and shines like a lit up disco ball in your hands!  I was amazed how distracting it was for me when I was in front of it especially in sun light.  I may do some buffing on it.  In closing, I love this camera!", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera -- A lot to learn", "Author": "D. Shackleford", "ReviewID": "R1KMP32WRBG606", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has a lot of great features and some of the pictures I've taken are really good.  I think the challenge with this kind of camera is learning which shooting mode works best to get the best picture in a certain situation.  Some reviewers complained for example that it is slow -- but in action mode, the response is practically instant.  Some reviewers complained that the pictures aren't sharp -- but I find it takes very sharp pictures if the focus is good.  It's easy to be out of focus or blurry with a megazoom like this -- but isn't that true of any zoom at 24X?So far my thoughts on each feature are:1.  picture quality -- great2.  wide-angle -- great3.

Extra features are really nice including 3D photos (which looked good on my Panasonic plasma 3D TV) and panorama photos, as well as continuous shooting mode which takes so many photos in rapid succession that they look like a video. One fun feature is pet detection mode which automatically snaps a picture whenever it senses a cat or dog face. (Didn't test multi-record mode yet.)  Menus are fairly easy to navigate.Although I am very satisfied, there were a few areas which leave room for improvement. Shutter lag as well as processing time after each picture was a bit longer than I expected, with the camera freezing for a second or two when \"busy\" preparing for the next shot (using a class 6 SDHC card). Photo quality was generally very good, but was a bit blurry when capturing moving objects or some extreme telephoto shots if not holding the camera still. Video was good but the microphone picked up some wind sounds in a light breeze.FYI, the Sony LCS-CSJ case is a perfect fit for this camera (it's hard to find compact cases for this one.)", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Olympus ZR-30 Camera", "Author": "Wayne R.

I carry it absolutely everywhere with me. It takes spectacular pictures and is the first point-and-shoot style camera I've found with a digital zoom I actually trust. I use it for everything from taking pictures of products for my company to list online to snapshots at my best friend's wedding over this past weekend. All in all I love it. I need to actually sit down and go through the manual and get all of the settings down but ended up accidentally setting it to one of the \"magic\" settings while shooting a gorgeous double rainbow over a meadow and got sparkles on all of the light-catching areas--windows of a nearby barn, etc.--which actually ended up being pretty cute, and I'm looking forward to exploring them more.On the digital zoom...my previous experience with digital zooms has taught me never, ever to trust them so when my friend Nathan, who carries his SZ-30 everywhere too and recommended it to me in the first place, showed me how well it worked on this lovely, compact little Olympus my jaw might actually have dropped. My photobucket site's album of the full moon over Fort Collins, CO from Horsetooth Reservoir has been downloaded multiple times by strangers which to me is always a good sign...many of the photos were taken using the digital zoom and the moon appears to be floating and embraced by the surrounding clouds. As if I'm the only amateur pseudo-photographer to ever take pictures of the full moon...still, it was heartening to see that other site members were enjoying my photos. A quick scan-through of the photos from the wedding has me grinning: I am already greatly looking forward to posting them to facebook as well as photobucket. I even got a few rather ethereal arm's-length self-portraits with this camera. I am so grateful I bought this --in particular-- camera. I haven't yet figured out how to quickly shoot multiple pics but again, need to sit down and actually go through the settings; I was so excited to get the camera I loaded it and charged it and began using it immediately. I highly recommend buying a 2nd battery and at last an 8GB SD card --it doesn't come with any memory, so get at least an 8GB so you can hang onto everything and keep on snapping. LOVE this camera.

I've had the camera for a month and I'm pretty impressed with the overall performance. It's definitely the most beautiful camera I've ever had amongst about a dozen models from Ricoh (Caplio R4, R5 and R6), Canon (SD200, SD650), Panasonic (FZ8, FZ28, FZ45), Sony (HX5). Build quality is very good. The menus are pretty intuitive. Handling is a breeze. The speed is good. Picture quality is very good most times as far as small sensors are concerned. Video is smooth. The filters are fun to use. Flash is excellent, open it when needed. Super macro is fantastic. Tele reach is impressive. Low light pics without flash are better than expected.

Focus not easy in low contrast situations when in macro or tele, you need some patience to get it. Panorama doesn't work well on rare occasions with minor stitching artifacts.

That brings up a list of categories like DSLRs , compact point and shoots, etc. I was looking for a long optical zoom camera and this one was listed as one of the best. I read the reviews of it and viewed the photos it took and decided it was an option for me.I love Amazon as they list all the buying options so I looked for a refurbished copy and selected one done by Olympus that was well priced. I took the plunge and the camera arrived on schedule and perfect condition.I took some time reading the manual that comes on a CD disk and discovered the great features it had. I have only had it a short time and I took many photos outdoors and indoors. The built-in popup flash is very powerful, and sometime too much so as it tends to overexpose the scene. I think a work around may be to place a white handkerchief or a tissue over the flash to cut down the light output.The long zoom is amazing as it zooms out to 24x which is equivalent to a 600mm zoom lens on a 35mm camera! You can extend the zoom range by using the digital zoom, which I turn off in the menu. A tripod or monopod is definitely recommended at this extreme range.I did not give the camera 5 stars as I thought some of the outdoor images were a tad bit washed out. I believe it is due to the lens quality in this camera. My former Panasonic camera had a Leica lens which was much sharper, but the images in the Olympus do look better when you view them on a computer screen and you can generally correct them with software.

I will not be buying Olympus any time soon and will be the first to speak up against the shotty products.

The stabilization option does not work well and I find the auto focus is slow.  If there is any movement by or the subject or myself the picture is ruined.  The dail for setting options is impossible to read unless in very good light as there is very little contrast in the dial color and the font color.

Once you shake the camera and open battery lid, it falls off because it gets unlocked.#5 Zoom control is slippery and not comfortable to use at all. Zoom speed is not variable, its constant even for video recording.#6 Panorama image maker has great quality loss. Images being made while panning camera instead of stitching shots after you take them. none smart phones can do better then that. Panorama available in full 180 rotation or standard 90.#7 3D images are not what you think. You cannot watch them with red/cyan 3d glasses or any glasses for that matter. You have to have 3D TV to do it, otherwise 3d shots are GARBAGE for most.#8 Screen shuts off and lens moves back in for no reason at all.

It does have pencil and some other garbage presets, but they are just useless but FUN.#10 you dont get battery charger into which you could place your battery, you get a wall jack that connects to your camera to charge it, and cord is like 10\" short.#11 no HDMI cable included.

I have purchased many electronic items from them in the past 20 years and have ALWAYS found them to be an above average company to deal with.

I have since gave the camera away and it is not even worth one star.  Olympus was not helpful with fixing the problems.Nice sleek, pretty attractive camera. I received this camera yesterday, and as someone who loves to take pictures I couldn't wait to play with it.  I love the different \"magic\" modes.  Fish Eye is definitely fun.  Its shutter speed on high surprised me.  I also own a Nikon D300 and a Canon 50D and the shutter on high on the SZ 30 MR out does both of those combined hands down.  Very fast.  You can make a photo movie and not miss a frame.  I haven't played with the MR side yet.  I also like that the battery doesn't have to come out of the camera to charge.  plug the camera in- it charges the battery.  Same with getting your photos off- plug the camera in by USB to the computer and get your pictures.  Much easier then having to have a card reader- that are typically slow, and often bulky with long cords and get lost.BUT- the book on how to use this camera comes on a DISK- useless in the field and if your anything like me, you don't like to shoot and learn at home in front of a computer.  I would much rather be able to take a small book with me and learn as I go in the field. I do a lot of birding and enjoy photographing them.  I also visit our local aquarium often and photograph the whales and penguins on a regular basis.You need a tripod when at the 600mm optical zoom.  I have not been able to get a clear shot at 600mm, but when I hold my much heavier Canon 50D with a 400mm zoom I am able to get crystal clear shots.

But...when you take pictures outside with this new camera they are really over exposed, so you have to move the numbers down to -2 or so to get real color. But skin color is the worst -- people's skin looks like putty. I understand that when using an old 4 mp camera, but a 16? And there's a weird distortion on some shots -- like windows are slanted when you take a photo of the side of a house. Sure you have a cool video camera and such, but the basics are off. I don't get why some photos at a certain distance away are clear, but other photos are fuzzy. Inside shots seem pretty good, but probably because the camera likes to overexpose so interior shots are very bright.
