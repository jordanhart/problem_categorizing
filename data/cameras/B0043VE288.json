{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best All Around Camera On The Planet", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R38JI2XZLQX8OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now I know that is a bold statement and I intend to back it up.  However, before I do I need to explain what I mean.  I am not saying this camera is the best at everything or even anyone thing.  Cameras that are the best at something are usually specialized beasts that can really only do that one thing well.  What I am talking about is a camera the is so good in so many categories that it can joyfully be used for just about and photographic or video graphic purpose you may have.  The GH2 is that camera.Now that is out of the way we can get to the meat and potatoes of the review.  I shoot mostly Nikon and Panasonic and I primarily shoot stills.  I dabble in Video but do not proclaim myself any sort of an expert.  I can say if you are looking for the best handling combo/cam with the most features then the GH2 is the one you want.  Panasonic went out of its way to make this a video camera so that was its primary focus with this camera.  However, there are lots of payoffs for the stills part of this camera so this is the best m4/3 stills camera by a long shot also.  I will also say that the hard core video market is a niche market compared to the stills market because shallow depth of field video is hard to shoot properly and hard to edit.  The average home user has neither the time nor inclination to properly storyboard and shoot this type of video.  However, with that said, it is really nice to be able to shoot stills and video.  And basic home videos are a snap to shoot with this camera; much more so than any other DSLR with the exception of the Sony SLT A55/33 which at least has a fast auto focus also. To shoot nice home movies, put the mode dial to iA, press the red button, and you are shooting video.This camera is the next generation of cameras as it successfully blends the advantages of Point and Shoot cameras with the benefits of DSLRs and creates and incredibly small and powerful camera.  Listed below are some of the benefits and weakness you get from this next gen camera.What's HotThe handling on the GH2 is bar none the best handling \"DSLR\" on the market.  WIth smart controls, great layout, fast autofocusing, swivel screen, full time double live view, etc.  Even with how good the D7000 is, it still feels clunky after using the GH2.  I get into most of the details of this down below so I don't want to repeat the info here.  What I will say here is that you can do things with this camera you couldn't hope to do with DSLRs and you can generally set up your photo parameters much faster with this camera.  The menus on the GH2 are not very good.  However, the actual camera controls are so good you will rarely even need to use the menus.Program Shift - Forget using Aperture priority with this camera.  You can leave the camera in Program mode.  With program shift you can change the aperture setting and thus the shutter speed while in program mode.  To do this you press the shutter release button down half way to set the exposure.  Then if the numbers are in yellow you just rotate the rear dial switch to change aperture.  Want a shallower depth of field or faster shutter speed, then dial in a bigger aperture (smaller number).  If the numbers are not in yellow then you are currently in exposure compensation mode.  All you have to do is click the rear dial switch and then rotate it.  Snap.  What a neat feature.Extra Tele Convert (ETC) Mode in Video -  If you shoot video you are going to love this.  This is even great for home/casual video shooters.  The GH2 has a 16mp sensor but like every other consumer combo/cam shoots 2K video.  That means the picture is usually down-sampled to make it 2K.  This has some pluses and minuses.  Enter the GH2.  With the ETC mode the camera uses only 2K of the sensor.  This gives you an extra 2.6x crop factor.  Which means your total crop factor is now 5.2x.  So that brand spanking new 100-300mm you just got is now 520-1560mm with no light loss.  If you put a Nikon 135mm f2 then you now have a 702mm f2! lens for video.  There are some drawbacks for using ETC also but they are pretty negligible.Auto focus - the auto focus on the GH2 is twice as fast as the GH1 and the GH1 was the fastest of previous generation.  I have seen some very knowledgeable photographers saying it is as fast as mid-level DSLRs.  While I think it is supposed to be a complement I don't think it is a very good comparison.  I find the focus speed of DSLRs has most to do with what lens you have on.  There are some lenses that focus slowly on even a D3.  All of the lenses I have used on the GH1 focus very quickly except the 45-200mm.  That lens tends to be my slowest.  Non of the lenses I have focus as fast as a 70-200mm f/2.8 but the rest of them focus as fast if not faster than any of the other Nikon lenses I own.  The best I can say about this is that you won't notice the focus speed on the GH2 as it is fast enough to get out of your way.Smaller lighter camera - I recently went on a trip to Egypt and carried nothing but my Panasonic gear.  Two camera bodies, 5 lenses, 1 flash, an iPad, and camera bag.  Total weight 10lbs (3lbs of that was the bag itself).  My Nikon D300 and 14-24mm lens would have weight more just by themselves (I was carrying the Panasonic 7-14mm so I did have wide covered)Swivel Screen with full-time live view - You won't know what you are missing until you become used to this and how well it works.  Want to reach up as high as you can and shoot down;  No problems.  Want to get as low as possible but can't lay down in the mud or water; No problem.  Want to take a picture of you and your daughter but there is nobody around; No problem.  Turn the screen around aim the camera at you and use the screen to frame.  Something that makes photos interesting is showing the viewer something from a perspective they don't often see.  The swivel screen actively encourages this.  The other thing the swivel screen does is make shooting from a tripod a joy.  Because of how small and light this camera is you can use a much smaller tripod.  I have a 3lb tripod that can support 7lbs.  Also, you can now set you camera up in all sorts of whacky positions and just rotate the screen to be able to frame and focus.  Very nice.  Also, with no mirror to flip up you don't have to worry about any vibrations.Touch Focus implemented as slick as on the iPhone.  As I mentioned above you can shoot from many strange angles because you can swivel the screen to almost any angle.  However, if the camera did not focus on what you wanted it would be hard to change it.  Now you can simply touch the screen on what you want to focus and presto it will focus on that.  The GH2 is worth the price just for that.WYSIWYG - What you see is what you get.  Since you are looking at either the screen or the beautiful EVF, you are seeing what the sensor sees.  With a DSLR you are seeing what the lens sees.  This is an important difference.  If you forgot to reset your WB or Aperture or any camera setting, you will see it before you shoot.  On a DSLR you would have no idea until you looked at the pictures.  Also, if it is a low light situation, the EVF will start to noise up and start to lose some of its smoothness.  This is a warning to you that you need to use flash or a tripod.  With a DSLR the viewer becomes darker but you don't get a very good visual cue of how your camera is seeing it.  For me the most brilliant thing with WYSIWYG is setting exposure.  Because I can see what the camera is doing with exposure, I usually leave the camera in P mode.  Then I change the exposure by changing where I aim the camera, lock the exposure and then reframe for the subject.  It works something like this.  I am trying to take a picture of a person but the exposure is picking up to many bright objects, thereby dimming my subject.  So, I aim the camera to include more dark areas while keeping my subject in the shoot.  Then I press the shutter release button down half way to lock the exposure and focus.  Then I reframe back to the original photo.  This works so quickly you can try several exposures in less time than you could set one with the exposure compensation dial (which is actually exceedingly well executed on this camera also.)  In a DSLR, since you don't see the exposure, you are just basically guessing at what you want and then shooting, view the photo and fix.  Much slower.Shoot about any lens you want - The distance from the lens to sensor is so short, that with the appropriate adaptor, you can put just about any lens you want on this camera. Canon, Nikon, Leica, Voigtlander, Pentax, Sony, you can use them all.  Generally you need to use lenses which have aperture rings. Additionally, you do lose autofocus but there are many instances where this just doesn't matter.  Macro photography is a good example.  You can fit a Nikon 200mm f/4 onto the GH2 and then either get a 2:1 reproduction or a 1:1 reproduction with twice the depth of field.  It is like putting on a teleconverter without the loss of light and depth of field.  Brilliant.Great for Newbies - All DSLRs are easy for anyone to use and the GH2 is no exception.  The great handling makes the GH2 better for newbies in my opinion.  Anyway, all you have to do is put the camera into iA mode and start shooting.  This camera gets the subject correct more often then not and will make you look good.  In dynamic situation, I actually use the iA mode quite a bit.  I do this because the camera is good a recognizing as scene as a person, flower, scenery, etc.  The camera then instantly sets numerous setting to make that scene look as good as possible.  If you tried to do it yourself it could take a few minuets to set and then a few to set back.  Or even worse you forget to reset it and you next pictures look bad.  If I have time, then I will set the camera myself.  My daughter has been using the GH1 since she was 2.  Here hit rate initially was only about 10% usable picture and 1% good pictures.  Her hit rate now is about 70% usable pictures and 20% good pictures with about 5% really nice pictures.  She has such a different perspective that it is really interesting to see how she views the world.Image Quality - I am reluctant to put this in the review because all modern cameras have such good IQ that it really is not relevant in most cases and any discussion encourages pixel peeping instead of photo making.  I will say, if you are using this camera to make pictures to view on your monitor, or publish on the web, or print 8x10s this camera will more than meet your needs and if you do your part make some really nice photos.  The GH1 has been my go to camera for the past two years and I have made some amazing pictures with it.  The GH2 is better.  You can argue the merits of FX vs DX vs M4/3 until you are blue in the face but the fact of the matter is it just doesn't matter in todays age and each year it continues to matter less and less.  All cameras have their limitations and part of being a good photographer is know what those are and shooting around them.  As far as ISO goes, with the GH1, ISO 800 was the highest I would shoot except in an emergency.  With the GH2, ISO 1600 shoots clean (better than 800 on GH1) and 3200-6400 are perfectly usable.Stills while shooting Video - The GH1 would not let you take a still photo while shooting video.  The GH2 allows you to take a 14mp 16x9 picture while shooting video.  So now you can be taking video and when you see something you want a still photo of just press the shutter release and now you have a photo.  Brilliant.5 fps full 16mb resolution and 40fps 4mp pictures for up to 1 second - Here is a feature I have not really seen anyone talking about.  This camera has become a fantastic sports camera.  It will shoot full resolution at 5 fps which is pretty pedestrian but still more than adequate for most sporting events.  The 7D and A55 shoot 7 and 10 respectively.  However, the GH2 pulls a trick out of its hat with an electronic shutter that will shoot 4mp pictures 40fps for up to 1 second.  Now for those of you who think 4mp is yesterdays news.  That is a 2400x1600 size photo.  That is good enough to print a 12x8 photo from.  Combine this with the fantastic new 100-300mm lens and you can shoot 40fps at 200-600mm equivalent.  Wow.I can go on and on but this review is getting too long already.  Some of the features I haven't talked about are Aspect Bracketing, Advanced Scene Mode, My Color Mode, Film Mode, Face Recognition, Fn1-3 button (Function) and the C1-3 modes (Custom Modes).  You can really tell that someone who enjoys making pictures designed the layout and handling for this camera.  There are not a lot of cameras out there that can make that claim.'What's Not1/4000 top shutter speed and 1/160 flash sync speed -  Panasonic has given us a partial Electronic shutter on the GH2.  They were supposed to have released a full electronic shutter but instead wasted research resources on the fad know as 3D.  A full electronic shutter, as we are likely to see in the GH3, will probably have a shutter speed of 1/16000 and a flash sync speed around 1/2000-1/4000.  Also, it is like to be able to shoot 24+ fps for as long as the card can stand.Construction - The switches are a cheap feeling plastic.  Please panasonic put some nice metal or composite switches on this camera.  I never had it fail on my GH1 but I was always worried and careful of it.  This is a bit of a double edged sword as the current construction keeps the camera very light and as I said I have had no troubles with the GH1.  However, The mode nob rotates too easily.  When I am pulling the camera out of the camera bag I often accidentally rotate the mode nob.Panasonic Flashes are outdated, lacking in multiple features and are heinously expensive.  You may wonder the relevance of this in a camera review but if you seriously want to make nicely lit indoor pictures you are going to want a flash.3 years into M4/3 and we are still missing critical lenses - 12mm f/1.4  25mm f/1.4  45mm f/1.4  35-100mm f/2.8  300mm f/4  300mm f/2.8  1.4/1.7/2.0 Teleconverters.  All MIA.  This and the flashes are the only thing really holding the M4/3 system back as a dominant professional system.  To shoot events and wedding you really need the fast glass for the shallow depth of field and for catching special moments in poor lighting.Conclusion:The GH1 in my opinion was a truly revolutionary camera for its day and was the best all around camera on the planet.  The GH2 continues the revolution and has added some amazing new features such as touch screen, 40fps shooting speeds, ETC mode, hi ISO shooting, and the list just goes on and on.  Frankly, there is not another camera that can even come close to doing all of the things this camera is capable of.  It is the new best all around camera on the planet.Pros:40 fps 4mp shooting for up to 1 secTouch screen focusingBlazing fast auto focus -- twice as fast as the already fast GH-1Clean Pictures up to 1600 ISO -- Same as D700Best video in a combo-cam to dateMost shooting modes of any combo-camETC 2.6x extra crop factor turning your 100-300mm into a 520-1560mm video lensMulti-aspect 18mp (16 mp per aspect) sensorBest M4/3 sensor - delivering clean images at 1600 and useable to 6400 thanks to the 3 venus microprocessors for videoIMHO Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, the best all around camera on the planetCons:Still only 1/160 flash sync speedStill only 1/4000 max shutter speed3D is a Fad -- No one wants to have to find/wear some goofy glasses to watch TV or read a book all of the time.

All MIA.Stills Purchasing ThoughtsPanasonic GH2 with 14-140If you buy a M4/3 system then you are going to want this superzoom as your all around lens.  This lens cost $750 by itself.  This means if you don't already own this lens you are faced with a tough decision.  The GH1 with 14-140mm lens is selling for $950-1000.  If you buy the GH1 now and then wait six months to buy the GH2 body, you should be able to get that for around $700 at that time.  Then you would have two superb cameras for only $200 more than the GH2 system today.  The downside is, while the GH1 is still a great camera it is not in the league of the GH2.  If you do opt for this system, then the sister lens is the 100-300mm lens.  This would give you a 35mm equivalent coverage of 28mm-600mm with only 2 lenses.  Very very nice.Panasonic GH2 with 14-42This is the system that I bought simply because the body only was not available when I ordered.  The 14-42 is probably Panasonic's worst lens.  Optically it is fine but the construction is not up to the standards of Panasonic's other lenses.  I would avoid this combo and buy the GH1 with the 14-140 lens for the same price as this camera.  Then down the road buy the GH2 body only or wait for the GH2 body only.  If you are just burning to have a GH2, and you only have $1000 to spend then you can still set up a good system.  Get this, and the 45-200mm lens for a total of $1300.  Those two lenses cover you from 28-400mm and should serve just about every need.Panasonic GH2 Body OnlyGreat for anyone who already has M4/3 lenses or anyone just wanting to shoot with Leica lenses.Video Purchasing ThoughtsBuy the GH2--period dot.  There is no other consumer combo cam on the planet that can even come close to the GH2.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Also an amazing video camera", "Author": "Tembrock \"Tembrock\"", "ReviewID": "R4R58HXXLOPX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "B.Fuller has written (for me) the definitive camera review which I wholeheartedly agree with so I just thought I'd add a few words here about using it as a video camera and some thoughts on advantages over 'real' DSLRs out there as of now.If you want a DSLR-style camera to shoot video this is the camera for you.  If you're an indy filmmaker and/or a documentary filmmaker you might even consider this camera  as I have.  There are of course ergonomic concerns shooting pro/semi-pro video on a non-camcorder form factor but I won't go into that here.  Rather, I'll just give some points that set it apart from the Canons (for now).- Flip out LCD with Live View (HUGE bonus over the Canon 7D and 5D Mark II)- Constant autofocus while shooting video (an advantage over other models)- The ability to shoot with almost any lens from any manufacturer with the available lens adapters: I currently shoot with Canon EF and Pentax/Chinar lenses.  For shooting video you can buy older primes that have aperture rings and get some really nice lenses for shooting video (both High Quality/Sharp and old/retro).  For the filmmaker shooting video, having to shoot in manual mode is no disadvantage at all.  The only issue might be having the lens only be able to be at maximum aperture since you can't adjust that with non-Micro Four Thirds lenses.- 24 Frame Full High Def Video (Cinema setting) and 720 Motion JPEG- Adjustable frame rates (not as fully featured as camcorders that feature this but still nice to have...GH2 features Percentages to measure the adjustment rather than dialing in exact frame rates).- Ability to double the focal length of lenses when shooting video (as spelled out in B. Fuller's review)- WEIGHT:  This camera with a 20mm pancake lens becomes the ultimate carry around for every situation camera.  Of course for filmmaking this just makes it easier to shoot handheld, put on home-made sliders and you can use smaller tripods- Clean/recordable HDMI out.  For those in the indy film world it's become a huge plus to be able to bypass the cameras built in compression (AVCHD and MJPG) and record pure HD via an HDMI out. Normally you'd need to buy a much more expensive camera to be able to do this and the cheaper cameras usually only have HDMI out in Play mode, NOT while you are recording video.  The fact that you can do that on the GH2 is amazing.  This means that you could use a Nanoflash (or similar hard drive/flash video recorder) to record the signal coming from the HDMI out and get uncompressed video.  I have not tested this yet so I would check out VIMEO to see if people are posting footage and see what it looks like.- No time limit on Video recording as with the Canon DSLRs (which have around a 12minute maximum record time).  This actually opens up the possibility of shooting events with this camera which you couldn't do with the Canons- Less (or no) overheating.  I've been on a video shoot with a Canon 7D and we had to let the camera cool down after an overheating shutdown fairly frequently.  I've never experienced this with the GH1 and don't expect this with the GH2 given there similar design.I'm sure I'm missing some glaring details but I wanted to put this out there for anyone considering getting a camera for making short films for example.  Get this camera, a Zoom H4N (or similar digital sound recorder) and a good mic/boom (or Lav mics) and you've got quite the little indy filmmaking starter kit.Plus you'll LOVE the photo features, so even if this was a B-Cam and you got the Panasonic AF-100 as your primary cam you'd be in really good shape.  The AF-100 I might add can share lenses with the GH2 so you'd save a bundle on lenses by sharing them between camcorder/still camera.Hope this is helpful for anyone out there considering the various video features of the cameras out there.  For more details I always research on Vimeo, Philip Blooms website and dvinfo dot net.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is it", "Author": "muttonchops \"Fortune Favors the Brave\"", "ReviewID": "R2N59IELI2F37I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this wonderful device for about 4 months now and have used it extensively since then.1. Its VERY easy to use. Its EASIER than using a Canon or a Nikon2. It has an excellent intelligent auto mode which takes care of a lot of things for a novice photographer.3. Autofocus is fast and crisp4. Video is incredible. Probably the BEST in the market right now. It has a 24p as well as 25p mode which IS the movie look.5. Has MANY shooting modes some of which are very creative and cool. It has a silhouettes mode which can get some amazing shots.6. Is LIGHT, COMPACT and very PORTABLE. I carry it in a Nat Geo sling bag along with its charger and an extra lens. I can even carry it in my jeans pocket (if required). Its probably HALF the size of an average DSLR.7. The SILVER version is ultra cool. It looks very very cool. I;m glad I went with SILVER because black was out of stock at the time. Praise the Lord.8. I also bought a 20mm prime and the shots you can get with this combo are unbelievable. Crisp clear shots when used indoors.9. I'm happy with this and will probably be the last camera Im going to buy for atleast a decade.10. Rugged. Ive taken it everywhere. For a trip in Himalayan towns as well as in dusty Delhi. You cant see more hardy conditions than in the Indian Subcontinent. Its held up without a problem. I dont think you need weather sealing unless you;re shooting in the rain or in the Sahara desert. and Remember, you can always buy a WEATHER CASE for the gh2. With that you're set for life.11. Probably the BIGGEST ADVANTAGE which gives this camera an edge over others: The firmware is HACKABLE! This hack is available online for free. In a nutshell, the hacked firmware improves the performance to an obscene level:> Shoot at ISO 12800 in video mode> 120Mbit 1080/24p AVCHD> Anamorphic patches availableJust search for \"gh2 hack\"12. Can be used with a almost any lens out there. You can use your Canon and Nikon lenses if you have a lens adapter however auto focus wont work with those. This camera will auto focus with MFT lenses only.NOTE: Read ALL of B Fuller's reviews and his responses to comments as well.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME Video Quality", "Author": "Ray", "ReviewID": "R15L3Q2VN8YQ2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "IMAGE: used this for events videography.  Even at the lowest bitrate and highest ISO, it produces brighter and cleaner video images than camcorders at high or semi-high gain levels.Please NOTE: the best images come with fast lens such as the 20mm f/1.7 or the Volt f/0.95.  The stock lens are really dark so i'd recommend a better lens. i also use a canon 50mm f/1.2 and produces such clean pictures.FOCUS: As a beginner, manual focusing is not the easiest.  but switching from autofocus, and locking the object by switching back to manual focus did the trick for me.  i'm going to need more follow focus practice.  speaking of focus, when not recording video, the screen zooms into detail.  but while recording video and manually zooming, the screen doesn't zoom in, which is ok, since the subject isn't always centered. autofocus is fast, but it bounces back and forth before selecting the range, even if you focus on object A, then B, then back to A, it will do a quick focus \"dance\" per object.AUDIO: the audio, even without an external mic is usable.  the issue i have, (1) which i don't believe is the camera nor the 2.5/3.5 adaptor is when i plug in a lavalere mic, it doesn't recognize it and continues to use the onboard mic.  but when i plug in the rode videomic with any adaptor (they are so cheap i bought 3 types, straight, L, and 3\" wire) the camera easily recognizes and i never seem to loose connection.  (2) Another issue is when you place the rode videomic on the shoe above the flash, you can't use the viewfinder since the mic protrudes back.  Perhaps other mics won't protrude as much. so i become reliant on the lcd.BODY: the body is plastic, do dropping it would be a very bad idea, vs. dropping a metal canon, i think will survive a few drops before being totaled.CASUAL USE: when used with family, the autophoto works well for me.  and if the mode is not is video mode, then you press the video record button, video will begin to play, but in Auto-mode.  video will only play in manual mode.WHITE BALANCE: i love the white balance. you can adjust a meter from cold blue to super orange.BATTERY: Needs to be recharged several times to get it's full life of 1.5 hrs.  I shot a 6 hr event and use only 2 of my 4 batteries, even while using LCD the entire time.OTHER: again as a beginner, the histogram and grid are pretty useful.CONS:-Wish it had dual card recording-uses a 2.5 mic jack, and not standard-plastic body-additional accessories that protrude backwards may prevent viewfinder usage.-stock lens have a high f/ stop.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "My wife LOVES IT!", "Author": "J.
