After adding the 120' extension I got nothing from the camera but white lines and total blanking of the video and no audio.

But I'd keep it away from RFI sources. RFI and EMI easily penetrate the thin sheath causing interference. I'm running this through the plenum ceiling and it works great.May 2, 2011 - I found a better cable like this in black on Amazon. Better insulation, a little thicker, better shielded and cheaper. Far better signal quality than this one, but it's also stiffer. See my other reviews for the exact item.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Only works when I *don't* connect the power.", "Author": "S. McMillan", "ReviewID": "RL1CVA6Q8HFHO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Not sure what to say.  I can only use the video and audio cables.  When I connect the power, I get no signal on the other end.  The power cable either has too much loss or creates too much noise.  Either way, its not useful for both power and video.I brought the power up with other means to the camera and it works fine as a carrier for video/audio.

This isn't really high-end cable (go figure by the price), but you don't need to buy Monster cable to run a security camera.  Just don't yank on the cable when fishing it into an attic space or the wall.  You'll tear a cable.", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "120 Ft Extension Cable", "Author": "Cathy L.
