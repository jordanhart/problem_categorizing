In the end, however, the camera was a waste of money.  The pictures were not very good, but I guess I should have expected that from 5.1 mega pixels.  The most annoying thing was the camera kept turning off if it was idle for more than ten seconds.  I would go to take a picture but had to wait for the camera to turn on all over again.  Not a big deal except when the object you're photographing is gone.  I ended up giving this camera away and bought an 8.3 mega pixel camera that is A LOT better.In the end I gave the camera two stars because it is lightweight and not a bad price for the mega pixels.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R3PUSEH34TWC7C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at a bargain price of $25 but still think I got ripped off. The camera works just fine- its not turning off, all the parts work etc. The picture quality however is just horrible. And I disagree with Cherry; I don't think the megapixel count has anything to do with it. I have a 5.0 MP Canon Powershot SD400 and it works beautifully. My LG Dare phone is a 3.2 MP camera and it still works better than this Polaroid a515! The low light environments are impossible as Rebecca mentions. Also the focus is completely off. I take a picture of the desk in front of me and instead it focuses on the wall 20 feet away. I tried multiple different angles and lighting but all yielded the same results. Another detriment is the zoom capabilities. There is no optical zoom on this camera which means if you want to zoom with the 'digital zoom' you will severely sacrifice resolution. The video function is unbelievably choppy and essentially useless.", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "The On and Off Camera", "Author": "Susan", "ReviewID": "R29E0PNREDJK90", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I hate this camera. It doesn't work now after being used for a while. I just wish it was made with care and put together correctly. I turned it on recently, took a picture, and it froze. I turned it off and then back on, and nothing happened. It froze and I have a feeling that's how it's gonna stay.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "5.1 megapixel resolution\n1 1/8-inch sensor 1.5-inch LCD color display\n2592 x 1944, 2048 x 1536, 1600 x 1200, 640 x 480 image resolutions Auto or manual exposure\nMovie clip with sound EXIF 2.2 compatible format (JPEG compression) AVI video format\n1/8 - 1/2000 sec shutter speed", "Name": "Polaroid A515 5.1 MP 4x Digital Zoom Camera (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BbbFh%2BJfL.jpg", "ProductID": "B000M5022E"}}
