{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GE Digital Camera C1233", "Author": "Walter Beeken", "ReviewID": "R2AW63G2VIFY7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is a nice little thing and easy to use, not as complicated than many others. The GE camera is offered at an attractive price. The picture quality is great. Positive is the OPTICAL zoom, many others only have a digital zoom.According to the prescription the camera comes with wrist strap, 2 GB memory card and warranty card. However, that is not true. The package was delivered via USPS very quick and undamaged, but to my disappointment mentioned items were not part of the package. Complaint to seller DiscountsJungle has been done right away after receiving the item, but the response was disappointing . DiscountsJungle said the website changes on a daily base and the camera comes as delivered only.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I could not ask for better - at this price.", "Author": "Dennis Miller", "ReviewID": "R2BU2F6S5G1YTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, the camera is just as described.
