No missing parts. Nothing broken nor scratched.I wanted a decent, cheap camera with a video function. Something that I could put in my pocket, leave in the Jeep and not be too distressed if it was stolen or broken. This camera, for the price, does a good job. Other reviewers have done an excellent job of combing over every detail so I will not repeat.For $50, it's going to be hard to find a camera that offers more than this one. So, although it is not perfect nor the best, the features for the price get this item 5 stars.I hope this video will give you an idea of what the camera looks like and some of its functions. Due to the length, I had to minimize the file size. I hope the detail is acceptable.For best viewing, click Full Screen, the X in the lower right hand corner, after the video starts.Thanks.If you want to see how this camera takes basic video in the lowest format(I had Movie Maker downgrade the video for Amazon review) use this Amazon link for my review of Wigwam socks: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZKNHDK8CQ6W/ref=cm_cr_rdp_per\u25baUpdate\u25c4I ordered in early May, it is now Sept 3rd. This camera continues to work well. It has taken some abuse being in my Jeep. I have put groceries on it, it hits the floor when I put on the brakes too fast and sometimes I leave the Jeep sitting in the sun. It has survived a 7 year old playing with it. I have dropped it more than once. I like using AA batteries.If there is one issue, and it's not a biggie, is that sometimes I must press the shutter button several times to get clear details on a closeup. Even my Canon SX50, Powershot and Lumix cameras have this issue....so, no problem, just the only negative I have noticed.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent, useable", "Author": "ps181", "ReviewID": "R1WR6K8G5UEU8V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted a cheap, working, point and shoot camera with better quality than my old cell phone, and it works for that.  Aside from adjusting the exposure you may be frustrated with some of the seemingly technical options; white balance only has presets, and if you don't want auto focus your only alternatives are macro and infinity - no manual!  There is a simple mode and a \"program\" mode with more options, but the camera always defaults to the simple mode when you turn it on.Focus has been the most frustrating thing for me, because with night shots or close-ups, the combination of auto-focus with the motion of my hand pressing the button makes everything blurry every time.  I've gotten around this by using the 2-second timer and holding the camera still after I press the button.  If that sounds terrible, avoid this camera.Picture quality is decent.  It's not the 90s anymore and you could probably say that about any similar consumer grade camera.  14 megapixels seems like a lot less when you zoom all the way in, but close-ups turn out well (when you get them in focus).  Video is 640x480 and again, this isn't amazing, but I'd pick this over any old video camera simply because it doesn't record the sound of a videotape motor (plus digitizing tapes is boring and expensive).Does not come with a memory card, has a tiny amount of internal memory.  You can spend anything from $10-$100 depending on how much you want.  I got 4 GB for $10.The Kodak software - which is not included, you have to download it - is pointless.  The camera doesn't show up as a usb volume on Mac, but it works fine with ImageCapture, so you can install nothing, get the photos, and get on with your life.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for my needs! Modified from 5 to 4 stars", "Author": "Nathan Kull \"Nate\"", "ReviewID": "R1M6YTONI3KWZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What I needed:- A camera that would take good quality pictures for site surveys (Information Systems), I take pictures of building layouts, network closets, server racks, etc.- Needed to take AA Batteries, I keep this in my tool box and don't ever want to worry about whether or not my camera specific battery is charged.  I always keep my toolbox stocked with charged Eneloop batteries and the ability to use those was a must.- Needed to take standard SDHC memory card- Needed to be relatively small- Needed to be able to take pictures in low light situationsHow does this camera do with the above needs:- I have been able to take decent pictures, I have not had near as much issue with blurry images as I had with my last Sony camera, however I would not use this camera to get crisp shots of moving targets.  Some pictures have come out clean and crisp, yet others would leave a little to be desired.  (They DO work for my needs)- Low light situations are better than I have experienced with some other cameras, however due to the lower shutter speed you have to make sure you hold the camera very still or you will get blurry pictures ... I think this is pretty normal though.  The flash works very well, however if too close to an object you can expect some white out.- I was able to take pictures during the day of moving cars outside my porch (40mph speed limit)  ... I was able to get good crisp pictures of those moving vehicals during the day, at night they were blurry.  The flip side of this token is that taking pictures of still objects at very close range has tended to have a little bit of a blurry outcome (still usable for my purpose, however not as crisp as they could be)- The rechargeable Eneloop AA batteries have worked very good in this camera, able to take plenty of pictures with flash between changes of batteries. I have not tracked how many with / without flash, I will monitor that and post an update at another time. (To be safe, I always keep 2 sets of batteries in my tool box in addition to the set inside the camera)- The size is perfect, it's very compact, but it has a very large view screen on the back which comes in very handy when making sure I have good pictures.- Works very well with my Transcend 8GB Class 6 memory card, very fast writes to memory.Overall, I like this camera, it meets my needs, and I have no buyers remorse...  If you are looking for a camera that is going to take great family photos that you want to post on FB and print out for greeting cards, you might want to look elsewhere.Additional note, I got mine \"used\" from Amazon Warehouse in \"Very Good\" condition --- Could not tell that it was not new.** This review was modified from 5 stars to 4 stars on 4/11/12 due to pictures not turning out quite as I would have hoped as I continued using the camera, I have also updated the above review texts to take this into account.

Affordability.  Yep.I ordered mine in white because it was cheaper, and it came with rechargeable batteries and a charger!  Several folks have posted that they had to buy those items, and recommended doing so due to short alkaline life in use.  So... I don't know... try the white.  The charger and batteries came in the same Kodak box with the camera, with special dividers which made it obvious it all came that way from Kodak.  Anyway, white saves a couple bucks, looks just fine, and you might get the same kit I received, with batts & recharger.  Apparently they don't all come that way, judging by comments in these reviews.  Good luck.Be sure to order an SDHC memory card, because the internal camera memory only holds four or five pics.  I chose a Sandisk 4GB SDHC card at $5.  I don't even mess with Kodak Easy-Share or the USB connector to hook the camera to my PC.  It's a lot easier just to pop the mem card out of the camera, insert it into my PC's card slot and there are the pics.  No software to mess with...

Need I say more?", "Author": "Christine Northern", "ReviewID": "R3F5GTVNR5ODTV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in April of 2012 (there's a reason they only guarantee these things for a year).  After a few months I was having trouble with my computer recognizing the camera when I hooked it up to the USB port.  The miniUSB port on the camera became loose and eventually the piece that allows you to hook the cord into the camera broke off and fell inside of it.  So then there was the piece rattling inside the camera every time you moved or tilted it.  I was annoyed about that, but I was willing to chalk that up to rough use on my part.  After that, I bought a little USB SD card reader, so that if I wanted to download anything to the computer I would take the memory card out and put it in the reader and get my pictures and video off that way.About two weeks ago, I bought brand new 4 pack of Energizer lithium ion batteries, which is what I usually use for the camera, and when I put the first two batteries in, the camera did not respond at all.  Didn't say the battery was low and shut back off, nothing.  As though there were no batteries in it.  I switched them every which way in case I had them in wrong.  At that point I concluded that the camera just crapped out and I needed to by a new one.  About a week or so later out of desperation, I tried the final two batteries on the off chance they would work and the camera fired right up.  A week or so after that, the camera was non-responsive after that.  And again, this was not a case of drainage after too much use-- there was no low battery indicator as I was familiar with seeing, the camera just didn't respond.Well, there was a chance that the pack of batteries I purchased was itself faulty, but as I didn't want to shell out a good $10 for a second pack of 4 lithium ion batteries in less than a month, I bought a cheaper pack of 6 regular Duracell batteries.  I thought the worst that could happen was that the batteries just wouldn't last as long, but mentally I didn't want to do the exact same thing and have the exact same thing happen again.  I put the Duracells in the camera that night and used the camera as normal. No more than for about 5 minutes consecutively.Well today, I was sitting on the couch, and my camera just so happened to be laying there next to me (in the Kodak camera case that I also purchased-- and works fine:) and I noticed that it was a little warm.  At first I thought it was from my body heat but I started to suspect that it was a little too hot for that.When I removed the camera it was hot to the touch on the side where the batteries were. I opened it, but of course didn't want to touch the batteries and I couldn't tell if they were swollen.  I shook the camera and the first battery fell out onto the coffee table.  The plastic had shrunk from the heat and the metal was exposed.  I shook it again a few times and the second battery bounced off the table onto a box of cookies and is now stuck to it by the melted plastic, hanging diagonal on the side of a box of cookies.I did a google search about perhaps average batteries used in high capacity electronics ever causing an overheat, but everything I researched simply suggested what I initially thought-- which is that it just drains those batteries faster.  There were a few things about digital cameras overheating, but that was only for when they were actually in use for long periods, and this camera was powered off.  I can only conclude then that the problems that I have been having are not with the batteries, which have been consistent up to now, but with the camera.When I bought this camera last year, I paid about $70.  I won't say that it was a waste of money, but it was a very expensive 1 year camera rental.  In light of the other reviews, I can only deduce that I got one of the \"duds,\" the 0.3% of the product that for whatever reason, is just faulty.  This year I have a 2 month old son, and I'm one of the poor people that doesn't use a smart phone just a basic one, so it really sucks to be without a camera right now.Next time I will be choosing a different brand altogether, and make sure I stay within the current price point b/c this is all a bit too painful.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "iti might be fine, but it DOES NOT WORK WITH MY computer and I think this should be warned", "Author": "Katya \"NYCAmberLady\"", "ReviewID": "R17HEPO5ZT1KZF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I mean what is the point?

This is a really important advantage.After 2 weeks of trial I can say that it is convenient and simple to use device ensuring fairly good quality photos for its price.The possibility to make panoramic photos works surprisingly well. Focusing is acceptably fast.  Other regimes fairly well correspond to the intended purpose. Series of two shots is also a useful function, which can really help to avoid such situations  when exactly at the moment of taking the picture somebody closed eyes, made another unintentional motion, etc. The automatically taken second image often helps to avoid this.Sensitivity and zoom are not exceptional, but their parameters are clearly indicated and anyway they also are acceptable in most cases.Actually the difference of its 14MP from newer models with 16 MP (by <15%) is not important at all. This is not like old 2MP and 4MP where the difference was 100%.I have not found important, but initially hidden drawbacks.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this model as a good inexpensive  point-and-shoot camera.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kodak EasyShare C1530 14 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (White)", "Author": "Raymond Bibbs", "ReviewID": "R1LTLIMET6U2AB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kodak EasyShare C1530 14 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (White) is a great camera indeed.  it's easy to learn how to operate and shows such a pretty and clear picture and the colors are so life like.

However, the quality of the pictures is infinitely better than any of the smartphone cameras. My expectation was that I needed picture quality that was better than smartphones Samsung, Google, Apple iphones, etc. This camera exceeded my expectations in that regard. The camera produces excellent quality pictures when there is sufficient lighting. It is small and easily fits in a pocket. It uses AA batteries. I use Amazon branded rechargeable batteries and I got 384 pictures on one charge with low utilization of flash. The images are crisp and look great on a high definition display. I have done side by side comparison with the same pictures taken under the same conditions with an iphone 5, a Samsung Galaxy S4 and this camera. There is no comparison. This camera produces much, much better pictures. I bought this camera to use in my lab to take pictures of electronic components. The quality has to be enough to expose some of the details. That's the reason I needed something better than a smartphone camera.For under $50, this camera is a good value. It works best as a secondary \"disposable\" camera. There many situations and places where you don't want to take your expensive DSLR camera and you still would like to have better picture quality than what a smart phone can produce. That's when this camera comes in. It also makes a very good camera to give to your kids. Additionally, if you are selling online and need to take pictures of the items you are selling, that would be another excellent use of this camera. Or if you are in real estate and need to take pictures of properties. Overall, a very good general purpose camera.

I requested a return, but then played around with it thinking maybe I just needed to spend more time figuring it out, so I didn't return it.. That was a mistake.. I have put hours into this camera trying to get a good picture.. It's so iffy, you can take two pictures, one right after another, with the same setting.

Bought it for my daughter, and we used it on our vacation to South Dakota. I was very pleased with the pictures the camera took, and also satisfied with the video and audio. We purchased an 8 GB Kingston flash card for the camera, which of course allows you store several hundred photos and made around a dozen short videos on our trip. The memory card is great, just pop it out of the camera and into my computer. I uploaded all photos and videos and put them on a DVD disc, so we could view our photos in our home theater.I had issues with trying to download pictures straight to the computer from the camera. Obviously a software issue. So I recommend getting a flash card. So much easier to work with, not to mention you don't have to worry about the number of photos you can take. It will hold a ton. If you're looking for an inexpensive point and shoot camera, I think this one is an excellent choice. I uploaded 5 photos from our South Dakota trip to give you an idea of the quality of photos this camera can take. Also made a home made video, showing quality of this $50 camera. Added a little 70's music to make it more interesting :)  Thanks for looking.P.S. If you never been to the Badlands or Mt. Rushmore, highly recommend going and enjoying the beautiful sights and fresh air.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "small, fits in shirt pocket, easy to use.  a real bargain", "Author": "#1amazon", "ReviewID": "R2KYXH7U7TZ839", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is just a great camera.  you will love it.  easy to use.  small, and fits in shirt pocket, big screen and after loading with 16 gb, can take pictures forever.one other thing:  i recently purchased through you a pair of shoes and two shirts, can you email me a copy of that purchase.  i have to return the shoes to targets for a larger size and i believe they will need proof i purchased through amazon.  thank you.  i purchased them about a month ago, using visa last four 5471.  thanks", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "its way better than i expected", "Author": "TaSharra", "ReviewID": "R12DUOVQ4B6V5Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i like it. for the price im really happy. easy use and its red and pretty.  get for a present also. it came with sd card and batteries.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "please credit my credit card and take this camera back", "Author": "david emerson", "ReviewID": "R13AM5EJG7V0C1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it is run on batteries intend of a plug in charger,plus it doesn,t transfer pictures to my computor.
