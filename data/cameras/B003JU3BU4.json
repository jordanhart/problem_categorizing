It is a great camera but the large telephoto lense isn't compatiable with Canon auto-focus so you are trying to focus and take the shot all in one.  The tri-pod is cheap and with the big lense and the camera it tips over very easy.  The back pack buckel broke in the first two weeks of having it.  Now I would be these items independent instead of thinking this is a good deal.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon eos 7 d", "Author": "Leonel moreno", "ReviewID": "RC3B1THL63QM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great package, items arrive on time, i love the cammera, i have used for 1 year already no problems at all, i recommend the vendor.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm very happy", "Author": "Ally", "ReviewID": "RH7V3EK061FM6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received my order promptly and I am very pleased about the product.
