Indeed I am still considered amateur level but either way so I don't have much equipment. But if size is the reason then simply a larger size is needed and should not bring this bag low ratings. I was able to fit the camera, standard lens, and a longer lens with the cords and other accessories.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "SMALL", "Author": "tisa", "ReviewID": "R1T7DESVSPQYGU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Doesn't fit all the items as shown in the pictures. The dividers take half the room in the bag!!! I only have a t3i with the 55 and 200 lens. Misleading. Buy Bigger. No time to return bc I'm going out of town with my new camera.
