I sent emails more than 7 to the store to exchange or ask a refund and I never specifically said we could solve the problem. Never gave me the shipping address. This camera is my tool for work and had to send in a Canon repair shop, the repair cost of more than $ 300. I have the repair bill and replaced the item. I feel cheated by the store from which you purchased this combo with great enthusiasm and I solved my problem. Still I have hopes that the store will handle defective camera and extra spending had to cancel for repairYou wrote me several emails saying that they could only cover up to $ 100 of the amount paid, but I had to delete the negative comment had placed the money to me and it would take 3 to 5 business days for refund, and then delete the comment and directed and now they tell me that I will return any money I feel cheated by you are a metirosos I have more than a month on this problem and I solved all I have saved all emails showing what I say, do not buy in this store are liars", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "kkj00041", "ReviewID": "R1WZXTZO5P5EV5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this few days ago.

I did receive part of the order, the main thing missing is the zoom lens.  After many calls to explain what the problem was, I finally received the zoom lens.  I didn't receive all that was on the special but at that point I was just tired of bothering with it which I'm sorry about.  There was other things that were missing INCLUDING a coupon that was supposed to go on any future orders because of the problems encountered.  By the time I finally received the missing lens I was so relieved I decided to let the other stuff go.  I was ALSO supposed to receive 2 wireless remotes for the camera but they were supposed to arrive by Jan 12, at the latest (not exactly positive about the date).  I received an email saying the items had been shipped out but that no other tracking would be available.  So I start my waiting for this.  At least two weeks after the due date, I emailed them telling them I never received the remotes.  I then received an email saying the order had been cancelled and that I should receive the refund on my credit card soon, I believe it was within two weeks.  I was supposed have gotten one of the remotes free because toward the end of the receipts online it showed what you could get as \"add-ons\".  I had called about this and was told to go ahead and order and the price would be deleted once they had received the order.  And of course this wasn't done.  One error, no problem, it was almost fixable... two errors, ok, again, it was fixable... three errors, not so happy, but still gave them the benefit of the doubt... four errors, I give up, they win.  Unfortunately with that win includes the best or worst type of advertisement, word of mouth.I gave four stars for the quality of the camera, NOT for the package because I didn't get the package as advertised.  If the stars were strictly for the advertised special, it would definitley NOT be above three stars.If you order any of the packages, be sure to check and recheck the special you've ordered.  It changed for me on the last part of the order.. the page you receive saying you have placed the order and thank you for the order and the expected date to receive it.If the question is would I order it again... probably but absolutely not with out checking and double checking the package.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Quick delivery", "Author": "Micaela Gomez", "ReviewID": "R1WJ990704T72A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched the price for a few months before purchasing.
