{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Starter Camera - Recommended", "Author": "C. Hill \"CFH\"", "ReviewID": "R2C2KN8TRZDCL9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Kodak EasyShare Z5010 camera is a decent introductory entry for those wanting more than a \"point and shoot\" and are not ready for a dSLR. I have used this for camera over half a year now for everything from family pictures to business product pictures and have come away fairly satisfied with it's capabilities. Here are my observations:Includes:* Camera* Lens Cap* Neck Strap* Battery Charger with 4 AA BatteriesPros:+ Body Size; larger body camera provides for decent grip+ Presets; offers a wide range of preset shooting options including the \"Smart Capture\" mode that features automatic scene selection and image optimization (which is pretty good and the setting I usually default to), manual Scene Selection mode (Fireworks, Portrait, Backlight, Stage, Children, Flower/Macro, etc), and other modes are easy to select directly on the dial including Sports, video (good, but not exceptional), Manual, Program, Portrait, Landscape, and Panorama (stitches pictures together in camera)+ Lens; features a very good wide-angle 21X zoom lens that has limited distortion at either end of the range+ Low Lag; good first shot and follow up speed+ Battery Life; takes 4 AA batteries (included w/charger) and has reasonably good lifeCons:- Software; somewhat lackluster, comes preloaded on camera and installs when connected to the PC (installed second time on my Win 7 laptop), but it is very limited compared to standard editing programs). The \"Share\" button allows preselection of options, such as FaceBook, FlickR, Twitter, email, etc when the camera is connected to PCMisc:* Image Quality; while generally color accurate and acceptable, it is a little \"softer\" than expected for a 14MP cameraThose wanting more control might want consider a different camera but, overall, this is a decent everyday use camera that can be left in \"Smart Capture\" mode for most of my picture taking needs and there is a preconfigured setting for just about everything else.Recommended, with the caveats above.CFH", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Jen", "ReviewID": "R1V9708IQHLJ3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an older version of this camera and used it for about 5 years.

I got it because of the zoom, 21x's It does weigh a little more than my pocket, and a little bulkier  but the zoom is why I got it.  It has a slight delay to take the photos but I like Kodak cameras and their software.
