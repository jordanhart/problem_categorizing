Troche \"PPP.\"", "ReviewID": "R10WV08NJ64KV8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After I recorded a lot of videos in the U2 concert, I realized that the audio cuts while you are doing \"zoom\" when recording videos. All my videos are spoiled because of this issue.The funny part is that I contacted samsung and I did the \"trouble shooting\", where they know about this issue and clearly they solve it saying \"do not use the zoom while recording a movie. If you need to use the zoom, use it before you begin recording.\".I contacted Samsung twice by e-mail, and they always answer that they can't fix the problem and I can't send the camera for repairs. What is the solution? nothing.Since I don't take professional photos, I don't worry much if the pictures don't look perfect, but I worry about a basic functionality of the camera that doesn't work.I made a research about this issue on internet and I found the solution on youtube. This solution proves that customer service in Samsung is horrible and they not even know their products.For other people with this same problem, this is the solution: \"zoom/mute issue is fixed by putting the camera in' \"auto\" video recording mode. Then go to \"menu\" and go to second screen 2/2 where you will see the option \"Voice\". The camera's default setting is \"Zoom Mute\" which is why the sound is muting while you zoom. Choose the middle \"On\" microphone and your zoom will no longer mute your videos:)\"Thanks s4pro for solving this problem on youtube.Pablo", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty good little camera.", "Author": "J.

If you're looking for a point and shoot with the flash used EVERYWHERE, this is the camera for you. If you want to take pictures in medium light without the flash, look elsewhere. Moreover, this is the least intuitive camera I've ever used. Navigating the various functions is frustrating to the point I just put it down. That, coupled with the fact that there is no user manual shipped with the purchase make this wasted money in my world.I'll be going back to the Canon PowerShot series.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung ST600 Camera", "Author": "Steven C.

The Samsung ST600 takes very high quality pictures with great true to life value, chroma, and hue. The additional front view LCD display is a nice feature that I use often.

There is no guessing if we are in the frame. We don't like to ask other people to take the picture, so this camera is perfect for us.  The pictures were very clear.

I had the camera ONE DAY and as soon as I would turn on the front LCD it would turn all of the pictures BLUE.  It was never working properly.  I stopped turning on the front LCD because it was making everything blue in color.  A week later when I turned it on the screen was completely scrambled and I couldn't see anything. I decided to send the camera back as SAMSUNG said it came with a 1 year warranty for parts and labor.  When I called and explained what had happened they told me no problem and it would be covered.  After having my camera for TWO WEEKS they called me back and told me that it would not be covered and it was physical damage on my part that caused the camera to malfunction.  The camera was never dropped, never damaged on my part.  This camera is a PIECE OF JUNK and never worked properly.  AVOID this camera and any Samsung product at all cost.
