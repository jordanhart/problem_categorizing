Chambers", "ReviewID": "R2AQLQJIHJDM9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did as much homework as I could stand before purchasing this camera.  I am still learning the ropes (first non-point and shoot) but loves it.  Was choosing between D3200 and Canon T3i and other than diehard canon fans the nikon won on most features.  One exception was articulating screen.  Otherwise the Nikon outstrips to Canon.  Love the Sigma lens, but haven't played much with the Nikon kit lens yet.  Couldn't be more happy with my choice now to learn how to use it.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Bundle", "Author": "Ron T.", "ReviewID": "R3TFTTBAV875C3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this in the other day. Already reviewed the accompanying DVD and it helped the amateur immensely. My only recommendation would be to swap out the 50-inch tripod with a sturdier one.  Once I placed the D3200 with Sigma Lens on the 50-inch, it was a bit wobbly for the weight it was holding. Other than that one small issue, this is a great way to get into DSLR photography. Thanks Photo4Less.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "There is not a better package with better service...", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R1NIYOVP74ZU8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must admit, when camera shopping, there were many tempting options.  Of course, we were working with a tight budget.  After reviewing cameras online, and with little exposure to DSLR brands (outside of Canon), we settled on the Nikon D3200.  The reviews were the best for the entry-level DSLR camera on a budget.  Then, there was the hunt...  Best Buy offered a package with an extra, higher powered lens and carrying case.  Awesome, but then there was THIS package.  Seems too good to be true: multiple lenses, filters, manuals and instruction videos, tripod, table-top tripod, carrying bag, and the camera (battery, strap, lens).  The package finally arrived, and it is EXACTLY what is listed.  There are no variations from the picture or from the description.  You cannot find a better package deal than what PHOTO4LESS has to offer.As a part of that package, you also get THE BEST customer service I have EVER seen or interacted with.  UPS tried their damnedest to screw up the delivery by attempting delivery when we were not at home.  Because the seller takes each customer and shipment seriously, they require a signature at time of delivery to make sure no wandering soul swipes the expensive box.  I had to place a call to customer service at PHOTO4LESS to allow the package to be released by UPS (We needed the package for a trip).  The customer service was courteous, fast, and thorough.  The phone rang once, and it was answered BY A HUMAN.  The heavy, kind and helpful Brooklyn accent transferred me to the correct department, on the first try, and I spoke with ANOTHER HUMAN.  The problem was solved [Leave it to UPS to not call me back when they said they were going to, but that is UPS.  PHOTO4LESS did an exquisite job!].I am confident in saying that the lovely people at PHOTO4LESS in Brooklyn, NY have the best service with the best camera package offerings available at the best prices.  We WILL use PHOTO4LESS again for more camera purchases, and you cannot beat the Nikon D3200 package they have to offer.  I gave them five stars for the camera package offered and services provided, and they deserve every one of them.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2SFP0CSKSURF9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This an amazing package!
