Screen is tiny, and hard to see what you are even taking a picture of. Decided to see what they looked like when you put them on my computer and they were worse than I thought they would be. Even for the price this camers is not a good deal!!", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "It works just fine, but not user-friendly.", "Author": "kelly nielcen", "ReviewID": "R3FQ4M0P7IOW3G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "While my expectations weren't that high for a cheap camera, I was expecting it to be more user friendly. I find it very difficult to understand. Simple functions, such as turning the flash on and off and switching between picture and video modes, are extremely confusing. Had I spent more money on this camera, I'd be more upset. But for $36, I guess you get what you pay for.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "VERY limited", "Author": "Becky Baker-Hall \"bbhall2002\"", "ReviewID": "R2QN1FNX2N3LRW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm so disappointed in this camera. You have to be absolutely still when taking a photo or it will be blurry. Indoor photos with low lighting... forget it. Even a tripod can't help get these photos clear. I will end up giving it to our kids. I guess you get what you pay for.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "pics ok, but vids sadly lack", "Author": "William P.

You can even count the whiskers on your cat. However, videos lack definition and blur easily. The camera is set up to be easy for right handed folks, but awkward for us southpaws. It is not as good as my old 4 megapixel Olympus.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Digital Camera", "Author": "Eboni Brickhouse", "ReviewID": "R17L95KCTVVWMM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera was a little more basic than I anticipated.
