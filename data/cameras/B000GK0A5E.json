Only problem I had is that it eats batteries but I got a charger and all is well. Am not good at reading manuals but the service people at Sony were extremely helpful and patient with me. I'd highly recommend this product.", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Beware!!", "Author": "Riverboatman", "ReviewID": "R2J8MANFV38GBH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After a couple of weeks, the battery lid latch, which is a tiny piece of plastic broke. Soldering iron and some careful melting got it where it would latch. After a few weeks it started eating batteries like a hungry shark. Even the high amp batteries would only take about 10 pictures and then the camera would no longer turn on. Blurry pictures are a norm. Just an expensive piece of junk. BEWARE! Don't even bother buying used.", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a good camera", "Author": "N. Priem \"piper binx\"", "ReviewID": "RZNE3X8VK4HHV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on sale about 2 years ago. It worked great for about 8 months, then it would not take a clear photo. Nearly ever picture I took was blurry. Soon after that problem, the camera would shut down a few seconds after turning it on. I regret ever buying this camera. I am planning to buy a Canon.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "cool", "Author": "ajmilone", "ReviewID": "R3QHIHQ3G493FN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera was affordable and was delivered quickly. I had to keep the USB cord from my old camera in order to upload pictures and the battery latch doesn't always close all the way. Overall, though, it is a great camera that gets the job done.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "M. Davis", "ReviewID": "R5FBM5DDCLH8F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera worked fine for about a year. It ate batteries but took OK pictures. First the door to the battery compartment broke; then I started getting \"file error\" & was not able to view my photos on the camera screen. Finally, I couldn't turn it on - the button would NOT work at all. Very disappointed - will not buy another SONY.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Brand Name: Sony\nModel: DSC-S45\nOptical Sensor Resolution: 6 MP\nOptical zoom: 3 x\nDisplay Size: 2.4 inches", "Name": "Sony Cybershot DSC-S45 5.1 MP 3x Optical Zoom Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411gzPidl6L.jpg", "ProductID": "B000GK0A5E"}}
