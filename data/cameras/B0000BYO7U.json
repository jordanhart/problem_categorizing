Why is the G500 the best?For starters, 5MP vs. 4 - not always the main concern, but it's easily the finest 5MP in its price range.  Sure, Sony has some new 5MPs out that are only about $50 more (although the ones as small as the G500 are around $100 more)  but they feel cheap, have inferior reviews, and lack the picture quality of this Minolta.  The only real competition for high-res digicams that are highly-pocketable is the Canon Elph 400S, but this Minolta is at least comparable in every respect, and of course it has 25% more megapixels.Makes fun camera shooting sounds when you snap pics.  Gorgeous displays and intuitive controls.  Quick and easy... start-up with cool green light on front.  Zoom very quick - zips open and shut.  great weight to it - not too heavy by any means, but feels solid in your hands - nice ergonomics.  I spent $350 - nothing else around that price point compared.  Buy it.

It is very small, fits in your pocket.  The lens cover is very convenient.  It takes great pictures at 5 megapix.  Start up time and time between pics is very fast.  The movie made allows you take 30sec audio/vid clips which is very cool and convenient and they come out great.  Its nice for those times when you don't have / or dont feel like getting your camcorder out.  My only issue is the red-eye - which seems to happen on all small point and shoots.  Most photo software packages allow you to zap out the redeye pretty effectively with the click of a mouse - so it's not a big deal.Battery life is awesome.  I've taken about 15 vids and 100 pics and the battery indicator still reads full-charge; and I always the display (not the viewfinder).  My old camera used to chew through 4 AA's after some 30 pictures.I was going to get the canon s40 which is very comparable but the price is better on this + its 5 megapixle + there is a 25$ credit towards memory card upgrade.

But they rank $150-200 higher in price. There ends some of the debate.It's usability and the final product (in this case, the pictures) that attest to the thought that goes into a gem like this. All control butons are well-placed, and clearly defined. The interface is very intuitive - you'll be shooting away long before you have to turn to the cd-rom manual (thankfully - would it be so costly to provide a printed book?) The default settings on this camera are excellent - but if we must, there are manual choices available.My tip on that long strap: adjust the slide to create a wrist length, knot the cord above that and cut it off. As for a case, I'm using a neat leather cell phone case for a \"flip\" type phone. There are lots of them around: carry the camera with you and try some out till you get one that fits.Or maybe a vintage cigarette pack slip case.Utlimately, this is a beautiful camera with features (like 5mp) that belie it's easy to handle price.", "Date": "October 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "Get this camera", "Author": "\"shelbylynn76\"", "ReviewID": "R1KOCB8MSKTS2P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned 4 different digital cameras in the last few years, but this is the first one that I'm in love with.  Compact, light-weight, 5 MP, brilliant screen, ultra-stylish, easy to use, and takes two types of memory (SD and/or Memory-Stick). Add to that the nifty green light bars on front which zoom back and forth when it turns on (reminiscent of a certain talking car from an 80's tv show) How cool can you get?  Few things to note.  The strap that comes with this camera is about 18 inches long...way too long for my tastes.  The included memory is a very stingy and virtually pointless (in my opinion anyway) 16 MB. So far the only really bad thing about this camera has been my difficulty in finding a case that isn't too big.

I researched a load of models before buying it and have had no regrets. I've used Minolta film cameras for years and the G500 is a great addition for anyone. The 5 megapixels are astounding. I took a quick snapshot of a flower in my wife's garden and it came out looking like it could be on a poster or calendar.The only feature I wish they had was a better battery meter. The one it comes with isn't precise enough to give you an accurate estime of how much battery time you have remaining. With that said I purchased a 256 meg memory card and can store more images then I know what to do with.It's also incredibly small but very solid feeling. Yes the metal case gets fingerprints on it but so what? You can easily remove them with a cloth. One issue I have had to adjust to was the lens cover which slides to the right side of the camera and being right handed my fingers tend to cover the lens as it extends from the camera.

You'll get great pictures without the wan-a-be photographer look - lugging ten pounds of gear to Jonnie's soccer match!Things I don't like about this camera:Because it's so small, you'll find you have several out-of-focus shots due to camera shake/movement as you take the snapshot.  You won't find out until you load them up on your computer.Forget the action shots -- tried many times to adjust using manual mode but all I get is a lot of blur and streaking (great artistic pics however).You will discover many menus/features as you enter setup mode but you will also need the 200 page online manual to figure them out.

My thorough research of review sites (the best is [...]) convinced me that I should go with DiMAGE G500 and I was not disappointed. Everything seems to work very well: the pictures are sharp in various conditions, color rendition is accurate (although somewhat on the cool side; try to play with white balance), it is easy to use and the resolution is great. On the latter aspect, follow Minolta instructions in the manual and you will be pleased with the results. The biggest file size is about 1.5 MB, which is quite all right with modern computers. Awesome sharpness, depth of focus and detail! Red eye for me is always a huge problem since my pupils are naturally dilated. However, at point blank range the flash with red eye reduction produces very nice pictures with only a slight red visible. The pictures are best viewed in QuickTime viewer; Photoshop darkens them a lot. However, simply tweak brightness and contrast and it will be OK. Did not have a chance to try the supplied DiMAGE viewer software. The learning curve is short when you print the 127-page manual (only supplied as pdf. file; customer service also a problem) as it has all you need and provides nice recommendations. When buying more memory, consult Minolta compatibility chart ([...] Not all cards are created equal; to avoid problems with bigger memory, use Panasonic or Toshiba SD cards. Do not buy a card reader since the camera connects seamlessly to a USB computer port and all works well. I did not care that much about fingerprints although they are in fact all over the place. Overall, I am very impressed with ease of use, style, size and (!) picture quality and can heartily recommend this little pocket-size gem. Lately (2 months use), I got some disappointment about the viewfinder and saw the same complaint in another review. On wide angle, the lens side becomes visible in one corner of the viewfinder, which I have to use in bright sun (initially thought it was a defect).

First is that it should be small so that it's easy to carry and occupy little space of your purse/backpack. You wouldn't want to have a huge digital camera to carry around. Secondly, it got to be light. You will be too lazy to carry your digital anywhere you want to take pictures of if it is heavy. Some digital camera's flash light is not bright enough. There's no point of having a high resolution digital camera if the flash light is too dim. It won't be able to take any good quality picture under limited lightings. Therefore thirdly it has to have bright far distance flash light. Fourth, the starting time and shutter time has to be fast. Sometimes the pictures you're required to take constantly in motion therefore you would like your camera to start up fast and take down the picture fast. You would miss some precious moments if a camera starts up slow. Some pictures you took will be smired if the shutter is not fast enough. Lastly, a high resolution camera is always the best and this cute little, light, bright, fast and clear Minolta Dimage G500 5MP digital camera has it all.

I've bought other cameras for my kids that were higher megapixel w/larger screens, but they suck!CONS:It's not as lightweight as some of the newer cameras and the screen on the back is smaller compared to the newer cameras but I have never taken a bad picture with this camera.  The only time I have had issues is if the camera is in night mode and there's ANY movement.  You almost need a tripod or you'll get streaks of light in your pictures from the movement.
