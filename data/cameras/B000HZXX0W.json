For the price you really can't go wrong, you will be very satisfied when you buy this thing.

The camera is easy to use and all the controls are self explanitory (if you have used any other digital camera you hardly need the manual). Going through the menus is quick - nice. The camera boots up in about 3 or 4 seconds, which STILL feels like an eternity when you want the pix NOW! You can half-press the shutter after a shot which by-passes the after-shot review, and take a shot about every 2-3 seconds. It's nice to play with the video feature, which seems to work very well and delivers a reasonable sound/picture quality. I experimented with various close-up and zoom features, and the camera has some difficulty obtaining focus about 70% of the time. Also it has some trouble obtaining focus in lower light situations. Hence the missing STAR - rated at 4 stars. If you like to take a lot of close-ups (closer than 1 foot) get a different camera. That said, if you take the snap anyway, about 60% of the time you still get a good pix. My overall take? BUY one, but buy a battery charger also. Great little camera. Eats NiCads for lunch.

It takes decent pictures, is sort of compact (but bulky), menu options are limited, scene modes are minimal. An annoying feature I found was trying to manually set the ISO setting. You press the Menu button, find the ISO setting, change it to 80, and hit the Menu button to exit (right?). Nope. After you set the ISO manually, you have to press the shutter button to lock in and save your ISO setting, not too intuitive. But then, when you turn the camera off and back on, its back to an Auto ISO setting. Apparently, your manual setting is only good for that picture moment.It's a neat feature, being able to set the ISO manually but not too cool when it doesn't save it permanently.Because of the cheapness, it went back to the store.", "Date": "December 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "excellent!", "Author": "paula", "ReviewID": "R1FB1239U9CHKT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace an older Kodak digital I got around 2000 and was very comfortable with.

It is VERY user-friendly: in fact, I didn't even need the instructions at all for most applications, was able to figure it out. Uses a standard SD memory card and gets surprisingly good battery life out of 2 batteries: as long as another camera I had that used 4 batteries.  But I strongly recommend using rechargeable batteries, nonetheless, as with any reasonably powerful camera.A camera at this price range would be expected to have some shortcomings.  Here are what I liked least:1)  Flash a bit strong in macro mode.  This is undoubtedly why the camera defaults to suppressed flash in macro mode.  The macro range is not bad for its price, but you have to be careful with the shooting angle if a close-up flash is needed so the pic doesn't come out as just a big bright blur.2) Pics tend to be a bit high in contrast.  Some may like this vivid enhancement, but the detail \"in the shadows\" suffers. Colors appear somewhat unnaturally bright.  This is easy to balance out when editing.3) Need a card reader.  No big deal.  SD card readers that connect to a USB port run about $10-15.I never really used the movie mode, so can't very well comment on that.It's also quite rugged. I've been less careful in handling it than with more expensive cameras, and it survived being dropped on hard surfaces several times.All in all, a superb camera for the price.

The zoom works well, though not quite as clear when having to use the optical. I had to get use to the delay when it actually takes a picture, but that had to do with my inexperience with it. Night photos where surprisingly bright when standing at a resonable distance (about 3-7 feet) and bright scenes are approriately toned down on the correct setting. The only issue is not being able to find the right setting when there isn't enough light, the regular setting can come out a little to dark and the night setting can come out to bright.

The camera works great-it's easy to use and the picture quality is really nice.  I'm thinking of ordering several more of the exact same one from this partner.  I have to admit that in the past I have been a little skeptical of ordering from Amazon partners, but my experience was so great with this one, that I will continue to order from Endless Variety and also check out the other vendors that Amazon has on their site.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very Useful and Compact!", "Author": "Richard Meeks \"Richard M.\"", "ReviewID": "R1EFE7YQUX8AZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera when my other one was crushed and every time there is a big event that happens, I take it with me. I love how easy it is to just turn it on and take a photo instead of having to go through a menu. It is simple to transfer to your computer, to share and edit photos, and its pretty small. The zoom is the only thing that caught my eye about being so short but for the price, it really isn't that bad.
