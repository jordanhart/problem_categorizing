I just wanted to fill er up and get outa there.  You have to be one brave gas station cashier to work this shift.So anything to deter trouble must be very appreciated. She had the obligatory cameras and decal signs.  But what stood out from all the security warnings and cigarette posters was this instant flashing sign.  It taunted you.  \"na na here I am, can't do nothin bout it\".Deterrence is the first line of defense in home security.  A camera  real of fake  is great.  A passive decal in your windows dose well.  But if you really want to point your finger at their noses this bugger is it.Constantly flashing on and off with a gentle yet very noticeable light.  And a very effective point blank message.  In other words '\"stay away and go case the sheep next door\"?  It operates when directly exposed to light.  NOTE! ONLY when being exposed to a light source.  Incandescent, sunlight, or fluorescent.  That activates it's power cells and you get a very noticeable small light sign.  But if your light source is dim then the sign will be dim as well. It works best under fluorescent light.  They use it on the side of cash registers, public garages, windows.  Call me paranoid but I have one on each side of the house.  But they need to be right next to your outdoor lamps in order to remain flashing. They are designed to be mounted on the outside of the windowpane, but I have ours on the inside.OK one last time.  This nice sign needs constant light photos to operate.  It has absoulutly no reserve power.  So where there is no light or not enough light this unit shall go completely dim.This would be a five star item if it could retain a charge and stay lit overnight on your windows.Oh yea and Gigi my pet African male lion helps also.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for store and business indoor use", "Author": "Michael E.
