This camera does have some great features, some of which I have not even had time to use yet. The main draw, however, (other than the size) is that it is simple and easy to use. There are tons of point and shoot cameras out there, and there is no use being snobby over which one you buy, because they all do pretty much the same thing. This one is great for the price. You could get a nicer camera, but for 90% of the people in the market for a digital camera, this will do what you need and want it to, and more.I use mine mainly for snapshots and spontaneous pictures with friends and the like. However, I do enjoy photography, and I have experience with SLR cameras as well (and I own one). Therefore, I also sometimes take artistic shots. This camera does it all unless you are a professional photographer, in which case, you already know you need a different camera.The size is perfect. This will even fit in small pockets on skinny jeans or whatever. The case I bought with the camera adds some bulk, but the camera is so slim, even the case fits in my pockets comfortably.I use Amazon Student Prime, so shipping is never a hassle. I can't really comment on other shipping speeds. The package was simple, but the camera box protects the camera with styrofoam and cardboard, and the shipping box used inflated plastic bags to keep the camera box safe. Someone would really have to try to damage the camera to manage it.Amazon lists plenty of features of this camera, but here is my list:RECHARGEABLE!Records HD movies with one buttonBig LCD screen on back to help compose pictures in a size you can actually see19 scenes to choose from to assist in getting a better picturePet Focus will find your pet's face and once focused, will shoot the pictureThere are several cool filters like selective coloring, a miniature effect and a fisheye effectIs tiny and lightweightComes in cool colorsThis camera will even warn you if it thinks someone blinked.Bottom line: This camera is what you want. I search for weeks or longer before deciding to buy something, and I chose this camera. For a point and shoot, it has everything you need, and so many things you didn't even know you wanted. Unless you don't actually know what you're looking for, you won't regret buying this camera.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overall a great camera", "Author": "Westoncito", "ReviewID": "R1K42J9S8S2FEO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera pretty much rocks for its price.  I bought this camera because I was in need of a camera update and the cell phone camera on my G2 wasn't cutting it.When I took this think out of the box for the first time I was glad to notice that it's small and thin and fits nicely in my pocket. My old camera was much bulkier and I couldn't carry it in my pocket without a strange looking bulge in my pants that made me look like an idiot.I am not a digital photographer so I bought this camera as more of a point-and-shoot camera.  I wanted a camera that I could snap a quick picture that would have lots of details and look pretty nice without too much photo editing. Normally when I take a picture I am wanting a picture of my friends or myself at a certain event or next to a landmark etc...  So I wanted a camera that would be simple but still take a sweet picture.  I can't tell you how many times I've had people trying to snap a picture for me only to not be able to get my old camera to work right and the picture(s) turn out horribly.  Like I want to load a fuzzy blur up onto my Facebook page.That being said, this camera can also cause difficulties with the technologically retarded.  This camera has to achieve a \"focus\" before it will snap a picture.  Sometimes you can push down the button trying to take a picture and the \"focus\" will be off and it won't even snap a photo at all.  For those special individuals, who for some reason are always snapping my photos, this can cause extreme problems with their abilities to be able get the camera to function.Now you may be asking yourself why I would have rated the camera so high and said that it rocks and then ripping it a new one, but I just wanted to let you know the only problem that I have had with it so far.  This camera perhaps is not the easiest camera to use, but if you spend 5 minutes to learn how it works then you will be able to get excellent pictures from it.The camera's picture taking mode basically has 4 different options, Auto mode, Scene mode, Smart portrait, and Subject tracking. In my experience so far with this camera I have noticed that the Auto-mode isn't always perfect.  I may have to take a bunch of pictures, before I can get the picture looking like I want it to look.  To be honest I am a bit picky with my pictures though. Many times when I am having somebody else snap a picture for me that can be quite an annoyance. The Auto-mode definitely works better on landscapes than it does for people (in my opinion).The scene-selector mode is sweet when I am the one taking the picture there are 15+ differing options that optimize the camera for different types of pictures such as: sunset, portrait, pet, beach, party/indoor, etc.  I gave up even trying to teach the technologically handicapped this mode after the 2nd attempt.The mode that has been the most useful for me has been the Smart-portrait mode.  This mode basically finds a couple of people's faces and then focuses the picture on them.  Since the majority of the time I am taking pictures of people I have found this to be an amazing option.  I use this mode for 90% of my pictures.  I get pictures that look amazing and I usually give the camera to other people in this mode although sometimes it won't take a picture and they will have to \"refocus\" the camera by re-pressing the button.The smart tracking picture mode has honestly not been something that I have needed yet but I suppose it takes pictures of moving objects or something like that.I could ramble on more but I figure that this should be sufficient for now. Overall this camera takes great pictures, they look sweet in print and they are very photoshopable (is that actually a word?)  and look great in print form and also on the web.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "When In Doubt, Read The Manual...", "Author": "Kricket", "ReviewID": "R1X2CTZOP1F1DD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my camera from Amazon this afternoon.  The first shots that I took with it were blurry, just as some of the previous reviews that I read stated they would be.  But then I told myself that Nikon has been making great cameras for many years, so if there was a problem here, it most likely was me, not the camera.  The camera does not come with an owner's manual - just the quick start guide, and that does not give you any details about the various settings.  The complete owner's manual is available on the Nikon site.  Once I read the manual, and found out how to set up the camera so that image stabilization and auto focus worked as they should and other settings did not conflict, everything was great!  If you purchase this camera thinking that it is a simple point and shoot camera, it isn't.  But that does not mean that you cannot take great pictures once you understand the settings.  Also, I should add that I am not a professional photographer - not even close - but I was able to set up this camera so that it takes great pictures.  So if you too are an amateur photographer, don't be afraid to purchase this camera. I am giving this camera four stars instead of five only because I have not had it long enough to explore all the features.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not an acceptable camera", "Author": "Real Raleigh Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R4BYG0IJCZW63", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "To put this in context, we purchased this camera as one of a handful of point-and-shoots; we bought a Nikon D90 shortly before having our first child, which is a stellar DSLR, to add to an old Panasonic Lumix point-and-shoot that did take pretty good pictures, despite an excessively bright flash. After a couple of years, we wanted to 'downgrade' back to to point-and-shoot cameras, given that ours is about 5 years old, and newer ones are both more high-tech and relatively inexpensive for the given level of technology. We bought 'a few' to serve a couple of more or less specific roles, all shy of the DSLR's \"big heavy super-high-quality photograph field cannon\" role. The purpose of this one was to be... well, the cheap one. The everyday, easy-to-use, no-brainer, compact and lightweight and easy for my wife to put in the diaper bag and take to the museum or the park with the kids. Cheap enough that if you lost it or it got scratched by car keys, no big deal, nice enough to take good basic photos but otherwise no particularly fancy features.Now, put in that context, time for the inevitable 'pros' and 'cons'.Pros:- Extremely compact, lightweight, 'sexy' design with chrome details around silver metal body- Fast start-up, about 2.5 seconds to power up- Continuous shooting can get maybe a hair more than 1 picture per second. Specs list as 0.7s intervals.- Battery life seems to be good so far, about 200 pictures and several videos over the course of 3 days with all varieties of flash and zoom and the battery still indicates fully charged- Zoom is pretty powerful for such a compact cameraCons:- Skittish. It's hard to get a clear picture from the thing even with a steady hand. Image stabilization does nothing as far as I can tell.- Because of the former, producing sharp pictures with continuous shooting is pretty much hopeless- Focus is hopeless in ISO3200. No, with any automatic or manual setting, with or without the flash, focus is hopeless. About 1 out of every 4 pictures came out well-focused. Even focused pictures seem to have blurry points in the same range as other objects that are at the same distance, even near the center of the scene. This is even for things like city scenes in full daylight.- Abandon all hope, ye who shoot photos indoors... focus is abysmal. Did I already make this point?- Because the focus is so poor, zooming in on anything, even a little, is absolutely and totally hopeless. Taking pictures of animals at the museum came out occasionally reasonably focused; zooming in as little as 2x produced worthless blurry shot after worthless blurry shot- As with pretty much every point-and-shoot, the flash creates a scene completely washed out with white light - needs to be diffused.- Very slow to become responsive after a photo; with or without a photo review, the camera takes about 5s to become responsive and available for another photo. This appears to be the case with 3mp the same as 14mp. Just very, very, very slow.- Very slow to delete a picture; deleting a picture you don't like takes 3 clicks, then about 3 seconds to complete the operation. It's a little surprising how any device (phone, camera, gps, tablet, anything) could take that long to complete a simple operation...- The shutter speed is too slow or simply wrong; if you have kids, who are naturally always in motion, they'll be a blur even if they're standing still to pose for a photo.- Slow to actually fire a shot after zooming and pushing the button - sometimes 1 to 2 second delay, which means, the subject (kids!) is often simply gone by the time it actually shoots.- Grainy. Even in broad daylight, color fields on high-res pics, like buildings and peoples' faces, is grainy and pixellated with blotchy color tones.- Video. Can't record smoothly, even at lower resolution, with a high-quality Class 6 SDHC card. Don't bother with video.To be perfectly fair and objective, I took this camera and our Samsung ST-95 outside and took two shots per camera, of each of five subjects, in the same resolution, at the same time. I chose the sharper of the two photos from each camera and renamed the file generically. I then brought up the photos on our 1080p 55\" TV - the largest-format, highest-resolution screen in the house. I showed them to my wife and asked her to choose \"before\" and \"after\", letting her know that I had swapped the order of the pictures randomly (so that A wasn't always the Nikon, B wasn't always the Samsung). In 5 out of 5 cases, she picked (and I agreed) the Samsung's pictures, simply on the focus. The Nikon just can't focus correctly. For example, on the back patio, the kids' tricycle is relatively focused, but the grill right beside it - both near the center of the shot - is entirely blurred out. All of my subjects were stationary out of necessity; I could not get a single clear picture of the kids or dogs with the Nikon, so there was no relevant comparison to be made. Using \"scenes\" to balance the settings made absolutely no difference on focus, only color balance.Overall, this camera is a fine solution if you don't expect much and you won't do much with it. You could shoot some video or take pictures of inert objects at medium range in full daylight and maybe one out of every two or three photos will be focused enough to pass a cursory inspection (don't look too close), but beyond that I'm afraid this camera just can't perform acceptably. It'll capture images, but they won't be GOOD. Despite the aforementioned purpose for which we bought this camera, we'll probably take around one of the better / other ones instead. It's really just about as well not to take a picture of those 'precious moments', as to attempt to do so with this camera. Other folks who have claimed that they are satisfied with this camera just can't be looking very closely at their pictures; after three outings and a few hundred pictures I am just amazed at how poor the quality of the shots are, in every environment, every light, every kind of subject. It's not for lack of use or lack of knowledge/experience with digital cameras; this really just has an extremely poor-quality sensor and processor and, I would assume, sub-standard firmware.I suggest looking at other entry-level offerings such as Samsung ST-65. Or, go for a mid-range camera. You really should only consider this camera if the looks of the camera itself matter a whole lot more than the quality of the pictures it can take - and, if the quality of the pictures it takes don't matter much at all to you. If you do care about the ability to capture images, this camera will not be satisfactory.I do not recommend this camera.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "An easy camera to use for the average picture taker", "Author": "NCBuckeye", "ReviewID": "R3K1UY2RYAR2LU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I consider myself an average picture taker: trips, vacations, special events...I have been using this camera for about two months now and am very happy with it.  It replaces an earlier Coolpix model that I was also happy with, but did not survive a drop on a concrete floor.  It is simple to use, my pictures come out great and transfer easily to my computer for storage/sharing. My old camera required two AA batteries and they had to be changed frequently.  This camera plugs in to charge the same as you would a cell phone. I charge it before a trip and it keeps the charge the entire time, a big savings for me.  The zoom on this camera is greater than my old one which is a very noticeable bonus.  It is also slim enough to slide into a pocket, another bonus, and hopefully a way to avoid another drop to a hard floor!

Needless to say this camera is going back and I'll be in the market again for a new camera.And for those of you asking, I took pictures of still objects, people moving around on stage, people standing on stage (little to no movement), and my pets.

The SLR cameras are much larger than the compact cameras so they will not fit into my pocket.  This compact camera has solved that problem since it easily fits into any pocket so I can carry it all the time.The JPEG pictures are usually quite nice although some range to being underexposed.  There is an exposure compensation setting to that problem can quickly be solved.There appears to be no way to change the aperture on the camera to change the size of the lens opening as with a SLR so different shutter speeds are used to get what the camera interprets as the best exposure.  This means that shutter speeds can get quite slow in lower light settings so that pictures can be blurred if the camera is moved during exposure.  This problem can be solved by bracing the camera on a hard surface like a table or wall or by putting it on a tripod.Also to get the best quality picture images the biggest JPEG size should be used even though this increases the total amount of storage needed.  Graininess is an ever-present problem with these economical cameras with small sensors so the lowest ISO settings (sensitivity settings) should be used (around ISO less than 400).  Any higher settings than 400 will give grainy or pixelated pictures.A potential picture can only be viewed as a so-called live view on the screen as there is no viewing eyepiece as in SLR cameras.  This may not be a problem for some people, but it tends to encourage camera movement since the camera must be held out in front of you as you take the picture.Also there is no option to record the picture as a RAW file instead of a JPEG file.  RAW files allow one to adjust the picture in many ways in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.  For example, the color temperature can quickly be adjusted from the RAW file, whereas, it is much more difficult or impossible to adjust in a JPEG file.Some compact cameras (e.g., Nikon Coolpix P7000 or Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5) solve some of the above problems, but they are much more expensive (around $370 to $500). If these problems with the Nikon S3100 camera are not important to you, then you should be able to get many decent pictures as snapshots without messing much with the settings.  The picture quality should certainly be better than those obtained with most cell phone cameras.  I rate this camera relative to SLR cameras as a group as three stars out of five although the rating would be four or five stars compared to other compact cameras in its price range (I paid $110 for it).", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't believe the bad reviews", "Author": "Cliff Addy", "ReviewID": "RZ6UDYNE9KZI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with a little trepidation, because the bad reviews talk so much about poor focus, poor quality, slow transfer, etc.  But hey, I thought, it's for my 8-year-old daughter and if it's really that bad, I can easily return it to Amazon (a big reason we bought every gift at Amazon this year).A little background:  I'm a professional wedding photographer, so I know a bit about cameras and I'm picky about my images.  My primary cameras are a pair of $5000 Nikon D3s with $1800 Nikkor lenses, so I know what a good camera is and how it works.I didn't want to hand my little girl a dud on Christmas morning, so I just spent an hour or so shooting with this little gizmo, indoors, outdoors, moving subjects, all sorts of stuff and I'm quite pleased with it.  Is this the equivalent of a $7000 pro rig?  Of course not.  But I experienced none of the focus or other issues some people have had.  My only explanation is they had defective cameras or they're completely incompetent.  Overall, it's a perfectly acceptable compact camera.  In fact, I'm thinking of buying one for myself, it's way better than my phone in every way and I hate lugging my pro cameras to family outings (they're huge and heavy).My only \"complaint\" is that when I hook the camera up to my Mac via USB, it doesn't show up as a storage device in Finder.

I expected a relatively simple point and shoot camera with great picture quality. I planned to take it with us on vacation.  No special shooting situations (wet, bright, dark, etc...).  Just general picture taking and day to day activities.On the plus side, it's definitely compact and a relatively simple to use point and shoot camera.  It's quick to turn on and shut off, and seems to be pretty responsive.  The battery life seems good, the flash works appropriately, and the controls/settings seem pretty straightforward.On the negative side, I've got to say I'm pretty unhappy with the quality of the photos that I got from this camera.  I have an old Kodak C433 (4MP, I believe) that seems to take better pictures!Frankly, I'm astonished.  I've owned several cameras and never quite had this problem.  The pictures are either too dark or too light, and often blurry (both daytime and nighttime).  The colors are often \"off\", though that's hard to describe in writing.  I've tweaked the various settings without success.  I've used both \"Auto\" and \"scene\" mode, and also tried various flash settings.For the price, I did *not* expect perfection or incredible results, but these results were so poor that I believe even cheaper cameras would produce a better result.I'm the first person to blame the user (me) when I get poor performance out of a device like this.

But I said, I will learn and make the most of this Nikon cam and then go from there.Unboxing it turned up the smallest camera I ever held! It's like an iPod touch from 2 generations ago or like a fat credit card! The quick start guide showed me everything to get started (of course) and I will have to give more time to read the owners manual at the Nikon Website as soon as possible.Then the moment of truth came when I snapped some pictures. I was in the basement of my house where the lights are dim and I was only expecting grainy image shots. To my surprise the camera set on Auto Mode snapped pictures as bright as day thanks to the glorious built in flash! I even turned the camera on myself in a fairly poor lit area and not only did it get me, but also everything around me as if it was a halogen bulb in the room. I didn't even have red-eye. I could show the pics if Amazon made it possible, but please know I wouldn't type this much if it was any different.In closing, I still think about the Panasonic and all the wonderful reviews here on Amazon, but the Nikon S3100 has so much to be admired. The thin small size will be some getting used to. I only gave this 4 stars because, let's face it, I don't know everything about this yet, and at work, nobody gets perfect scores. It would appear like their manager overlooked something if they did. I'm glad I got this camera and can't wait to test it outside in the snow tomorrow.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hundreds of photos and so happy with it!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"indigoheirlooms\"", "ReviewID": "R3G1QM1LOJKHMB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As an artist I snap hundreds of pictures a week for inspiration, fun, memories etc. I am documenting my year and my cell phone camera won't do, my canon is too big to take everywhere. So this camera was perfect. I bought it in red and it is BEAUTIFUL! That's not why you buy a camera though, pictures and lots of them, is what a camera is all about.One reason I choose this is the macro lens my work is small and the macro lens was important. It works well. (included in images is a micro model of a ship). I also used the museum mode which makes pictures have a beige hue but it is not unpleasant.Food? well food mode works well when the lighting is off such as in a semi lit room or in fluorescents (included image)Clubs? perfect! The night and party mode really works well.(included images).Color options of photos? well the black and white lacks depth of film cameras but is ok. Vivid color is amazing.Zoom - Love it and use it often. (included image) It keeps the detail as long as the focus is rightFocus - always an issue with a point and shot and a digital makes it worse. This camera has pretty good focus. It works well for still shots, poses, miniatures. The challenge? if part of the picture is still and the other part is in motion. Like someone sitting but people moving around them. The camera will focus on on part. If you have it pointed slightly differently either the background or the foreground will be in focus, not both. Or if the background is really busy the focus will be blurred on what you don't center.Movement...ahh I haven't used the sports mode but I have taken a lot of action shots. There is some doppelganging if a person moves too quickly which is an interesting effect but may ruin a shot because sometime the picture is just a blur. Other times the effect is great. This is the same if you are moving (included image)Skin hues are good even on prints. Prints 4X6 come out well, however 8X10 prints loose resolution and come out pixelated. Horrible? no but not great. I would like the option of bigger prints.Timing...yours and the cameras. Digital, especially point and shoots require holding the shot for a moment. Not letting the subject or the camera move too quickly. This camera has better timing than my phone but not as well as my canon. there is a lag time after pressing shoot and when it actually captures the shot making it necessary to hold the camera in place longer than you think you need to.Battery life - Amazing! I shot 250 pictures in 2 weeks before the battery needed to be recharged. Pet peeve and huge CON - the battery showed full charge until right before it shut off. It went from full charge icon to half charge to shutting off in 10 minutes. The next day I turned the camera on and it showed fully charged icon right before it shut off because of a dead battery. So I have no idea when the thing is going to shut off. That is the reason I gave it 4 stars I have to charge it whether the icon says full or not.This camera is excellent for what it is. An inexpensive point and shoot. Yes you will lose shots, every camera does that. Yes the blow up isn't great a more expensive professional camera is perfect for that. This is better than the average camera in the $80 - $250 range. Use it for what it is made for and you will be perfectly happy.note: a famous photographer once told me the secret of great shots. Take hundreds and thousands of photos and don't be afraid of throwing out what doesn't work.

I bought this camera to take to work with me-- I work at a marsh restoration site-- to take pictures of the wildlife. It didn't really work out, so I returned it. This might be a good beginner camera. Maybe good for someone who isn't looking for much detail, wants something tiny and just wants to snap some shots of friends and the like. My two major complaints are:1. Poor color reproduction. I had to increase or decrease the saturation in every picture I took. Some colors would show up disproportionately bright and wash out all the detail (such as red or yellow flowers), and other's would be incredibly dull. The latter especially with colors that aren't bright naturally- it would dull them even more than they really were. Anything a pastel color lost all its vibrance. The only color I noticed that was pretty spot on was green. The greens were great, but the other colors not so much.2. Poor image stabilization. I got lots of blurry and soft images from this camera. If you were to use a tripod you'd get incredibly crisp shots. But, being that this is a super portable camera, that sort of defeats the purpose-- that being, NOT having to carry around something bulky. I took some daytime landscape shots that came out much too blurry, considering that I was standing still and it was daylight. On the other hand, when I held my breath and propped the camera against something to take some macro shots of shells, they actually came out pretty good. Expect that about 50% of your photos will be blurry or lacking detail, and the other 50% will be very clear. But even in the clear shots the color killed it for me. The end product is really hit or miss with this camera.The bottom line is, as mentioned above, if you're not looking for much detail and want something small enough to slip into your pocket, then this might be a good camera for you.

Set up for the maximum resolution, the pictures aren't far away from my old Samsung  which only had 3.1 MP.  The camera is very portable, but it doesn't perform as good as it looks , 5 X is great for an entry level camera.1)The camera is pretty slow with the class 6, I just ordered the Sandisk class 10  30 M/s  ; I was told by Nikon that using a non-approved memory card is the reason my videos are limited to 8 minutes, the approved ones are Panasonic, Toshiba, Sandisk and Lexar . I will find out on monday . After I received the new card , I'll see if the speed(time between taking each pictures ) improves  and then I will  update my rating.2)You can digitally zoom while recording video , but honestly, the quality get very distorted . Quite frankly, the videos don't look at all like 720P. My iPhone 4 shoots better.My conclusion is many cameras are much faster with a class 6  20M/s card  than this one .  My biggest issue is the speed issue, you might miss some beautiful shots just because of that and it can get you frustrated . If you need a fast shooting compact camera, well this is not for you , you might as well try something else. My dad used to tell  me that you get what you paid for, well he was right.  I am very afraid that I might just have to pay a little more . I hope this helps , shoot me a question if you need any informations.(update)I ended up returning it for a Canon ELPH 300 S and it blows the Nikon out of the water . The Nikon did do better  with the class 10 Sandisk than the class 6  Transcend I originally purchased  ,  but it didn't change  the fact that it cannot record videos over 8 minutes like the Nikon customer service told me.  I was lied to, so I ended up buying that expensive Sandisk. One thing I have noticed is the Canon is much faster out of the box to Focus  (keep in mind it cost about 85 to 90  bucks more than the Nikon ).

It's very sensitive to even the slightest hand shake and therefore has a high blur potential. I had to lower the MP quality to 5 so that I could take pictures in focus.

The shutter and zoom combo button is a little wobbly and the body is really really light. I have been playing with it the last few days and have been able to get some decent photos. Sometimes it doesn't focus very well, but I always use the method of holding the shutter halfway down until it is in focus and then press it the rest of the way to take the shot. In doing this, I can always tell before ever even taking the photo that the camera is out of focus. This allows me to release the shutter and try again.To be honest, I wouldn't use this camera as my primary camera. For the cost, I feel that there are other point and shoot camera that feel less cheap and take more consistently focused photos.

On my Kodak, by putting the camera on the action scene I could get decent pictures of my pets. Not so with this camera.

After I lost it, I could not find another one just like it so since I was happy with my big Nikon SLR, I went with this camera.  I realized that while Nikon is a great SLR, their point and shoots leave a lot to be desired.I bought the camera before a beach vacation and I loved that it fit in my back pocket.  It was sleek and slim.  But the pictures were always blurry.  I could not just whip it out and start shooting.  I had to stop, steady the camera and zoom in and out until I was sure it was ready to shoot and it was still blurry.  The colors were noisy and bland.  This was a while just standing still.  So I knew that taking this camera to a concert would be a mistake.  It does horribly in low lighting and heaven help you if there was any backlighting.  The zoom only made the pictures look more grainy.  My pictures all came out like a drunk had shot them.After two years, I began to think about replacing this piece of garbage.  This camera ultimately made the decision for me because now, it won't charge at all.  I only use my camera in the summer, usually on vacation or outdoor events so I did not get a lot of use out of it before it died.I will recommend Nikon as an SLR but I highly recommend you think about a Cannon if you're looking for a small point and shoot.

They are used in the field by personnel to take pictures of job site progress. We do not operate in harsh environments. The cameras work well for this purpose and we actually need to turn the quality down on them to make the photos a little smaller for our purposes. As far as a point and shoot camera they have all been good performers. It's obviously no match for my Canon DSLR, but for the money spent they are good value. I think we have 4 or 5 of these S3100s in our fleet and one of the newer S3300s. It seems at about the 4500-5000 picture range the lens motor ends up failing. It sounds like there is a stripped gear in it. Nikon has repaired 3 of mine under warranty so far, and the 4th one is sitting here on my desk waiting to be sent to repair. This one has a lens motor failure AND the LCD screen is completely white. I'm not sure if it's a defect of the S3100, but these were purchased over a period of time in 2011 (September, October, November, April 2012) from Amazon.com and as of this week every one of them has failed with the same failure method (lens motor clicking/jammed/stripped gear). Nikon has been excellent with the repair process. It doesn't even require a phone call. Just fill out a form on the web site and send the camera off with a copy of the receipt and you're good to go. The repair process has been a little slow, but I keep an extra camera around for just this reason. At the price, it's cheap enough to do. The S3300 (newer model) that we have has not yet exhibited this problem, but it is a good bit newer than the others (purchased in August 2012). Only time well tell I suppose. I definitely would steer clear of this older model if you're just trying to save a few bucks. The newer S3300 can be had for less money on Amazon.com, but then again, I can't promise that one doesn't have these issues as well.

I started searching for a local store here in Argentina and all of them refused to provide service since the guarantee does not cover other countries than the few listed on the brochure inside the box.

By the time the camera decides to take the picture, they have moved on. The only time it takes OK pictures is outside in the sun. Even then 50% of pictures come out of focus. I have tried all sorts of tricks to make it focus right, to no avail...As soon as it came, it started having problems. Two months into it, the camera would not charge. I sent it to Nikon for customer service. You have to pay shipping yourself even during the warranty period. Well, it came back with a note that they fixed it. Not really, I went out of charge again, and would not charge. I sent it again, they sent it back saying they could not find any problems. Really? I finally diagnosed one problem to be incorrect battery level indicator. It shows full until it completely drains and if you leave it be, it would not charge again (evidently completely draining battery is a bad thing).Lastly, the lens gets stuck. It is at a point where the lens isn't coming out 90% of the time. I am sending it one last time for repairs. I have already spent an additional $30 for shipping. I thought I was getting a good price on it. Well, not anymore...I would never ever buy another Nikon product. No matter the Amazon reviews. I understand that there can be sometimes defective products. But when there is one, you repair it right, or replace it.

I ordered it 11-28-11 and received it on 12-7-11. It worked fine for my first use on a hike around my local park. the secound time I used it was on new year's eve. half way through the night the camera shut itself off. I thought it was simply the battery being spent but soon realized that was not the case. The shutter was half open/closed and the ligths on the camera were blinking. I tried everything to trouble shoot the camera but eventually it jsut completely shut down with the apature still stuck.I contacted Amazon customer service the next day and within 10 minuets on the phone with a very nice represtative they had a order in for my replacement. I was informed that I should return the broken one with the box form the new camera once it arrived.  So I waited...and waited. After a while of it being in the \"has not shipped\" status i contacted Amazon customer support, this time via live chat. once again a spoke to a very nice representative who advised me the delay was due to in being out of stock (I had ordered a specific color so I believed that to be the reason). I was okay with waiting further due to that explaination.The trouble came later after it had been close to 2 months of waiting and I again contacted Amazon for a status update. Again a very pleasant representative was there to answer my questions. My main concern was that the replacement order had disappeared off of my orders page and I inquired as to the reason for this. It was determined that the order had been canceled...the reason behind this? It was that they were totally out of stock with these cameras completely. Apparently the third party seller ADORAMA Camera was not able to provide Amazon with these cameras any further. I would normally not hav had a probelm with this had I been notified of this in any way, shape or form...but I wasn't. Not by Amazon nor the seller. Also after the extensive wait and the many times I was told that they were working on getting the replacement out to me, I feel that I was just being moved throught the system.I thanked the representative for his ground work and kiindness in the matter, as he did send out a email for me to print out a pre-paided return label and offer a $10 promotion towards my account, and proceeded to ask if I may speak to a manager.  My conern in talking to the manager was a few things:  1)To place a formal compaint against this third party sller and that Amazon not work with them further  2)The camera that I ordered was still for sale on Amazon, if so why was it that I couldn't get a replacement in another color.  3) A smple return for my money was not acceptable to me after nearly 3 months of toil and still not hving the product I wished, promotion or not.So I spoke to a lovely woman for a while about my concerns and after some time we came to a conclusion of my devising. Since Amazon couldn't provide my with a replacement from the camera I ordered, nor providing it in a different color, due to the seller not being able to get the product to Amazon (I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMEND NEVER BUYING FROM ADORAMA!!), I suggested that they provide me with a different model of the same camera that was stocked, sold and shipped directly through Amazon (Nikon COOLPIX S6100 16 MP Digital Camera with 7x NIKKOR Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and 3-Inch Touch-Panel LCD (Silver)(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M8SVEI). The manager agreed that she would go ahead and do a one time replacement for this product for my defective camera and also place the $10 promotion offered to me on the price as well.In conclusion, this whole matter has been a wretch, but after everything Amazon was able to come throught for me and satisfy my order by providing me with a product and not just a return and a rebate, which I am very greatful for. The seller ADORAMA is the worst I have ever dealt with and I would warn anyone against them. My faith is still with Amazon, even if there was a slight waiver, and I will continue to shop and buy from them, while being more careful of third party sellers.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broken in 34 days.", "Author": "Gina L.

So when I saw this on sale for less than $100 I went for it. For the price I paid, it's probably okay but I give it 2 stars because I wouldn't recommend this to a friend and given the chance again, I wouldn't buy another one. Assuming that you're in the right light already, and that your subject isn't moving much, the pictures this takes are great. Outside of these conditions, this camera is pretty useless. The image stabilization on this is pretty much non-existent and it's horrible with lighting. It's terrible at correcting the white balance for indoor lighting and it picks up yellowish light where there isn't any. The flash is horrible too. Its too bright and has a tendency to completely wash everything out and there's always red-eye. Plus if you leave it on auto, the flash will pretty much always go off. It takes good pictures in the daytime and in natural light but beyond that not so much. Focusing is also very minimal. If your subject moves at all while taking the picture, it doesn't adjust the focus resulting in fuzzy pics. So now I have a bunch of pictures where I made my nephew stop and pose so I could get a clean shot of him, and his face is focused but his hands are all a blur since he is a bit fidgety with his fingers.It's okay as a backup and I don't mind letting the kids play with it but I miss my old powershot. Also, it bugs me that I have to plug the whole camera in to charge the battery. What's the point of a removable battery if it doesn't have it's own charger? I hate leaving my cameras out where they could be knocked off the table by the dog and then subsequently stepped on by the kid chasing the dog. I prefer it when I only have to risk the battery by leaving it out to charge but maybe I should be glad for it this time because then I'd have an excuse to replace it.I wouldn't rely on this camera to take care of all the important moments in life but if you're looking for something purse-sized for non-essential events this will work. I wasn't expecting it to take pics as great as my DSLR but my old P&S; from 4 years ago would still have outperformed this one. For the price, this would be good for a child or someone who only very seldom takes pictures but if you're going to buy this as your main camera I would skip it.

I do wish it had a zoom that goes closer up...oh well;  4) it is sometimes hard to get a clear photo, but with practice and trying different settings, and taking multiple photos --film is cheap nowadays-- I was able to get tons of really nice photos anyway; I also found that many times the flash washed things out too much).For a small, very light-weight, easy-to-use, reliable, inexpensive camera, this was a really great buy (in spite of it's drawbacks).

Since I can still download photos to my PC manually using the Nikon photo application, I decided to keep the camera.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "P\u00e9sima calidad de la c\u00e1mara; excelente respuesta de Amazon", "Author": "Francisco Marquez", "ReviewID": "R3RB7KBV0G4GKG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Compr\u00e9 esta c\u00e1mara en noviembre del 2011, tres d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de recibida el lente se trabo, la apagu\u00e9 pensando que al encenderla funcionar\u00eda nuevamente, y nada.

I wasn't expecting amazing photos, but I was expecting passable quality. My girlfriend had just recently purchased a Canon point and shoot for the same purpose and her camera performed admirably, focusing quite quickly and even performing somewhat decently indoors.We'll start with the few good points. For such a cheap camera it seems reasonably well built and looks quite stylish. The bright blue case makes it hard to forget. The LCD screen in back is bright and works quite well. Controls are reasonably simple (but don't expect much in the way of manual control.)Now for the cons. This camera just doesn't perform well at all. Almost all photos with this camera come out blurry, it doesn't matter if it's a landscape, a person posing, or an inanimate object. Even high shutter speeds (1/200 or more), no zoom and low ISO will not alleviate this. It's just a fact of life with this camera that your photos will look grainy, fuzzy and you will never get sharp focus.The camera is also slow. It takes a long time to find \"focus\" but as mentioned above it's still blurry. There's a delay between depressing the shutter button and camera taking a photo. There's a long lag between taking photos. Deleting photos also takes a long time. Changing scenes can be a bit of pain since it requires using digital menus and doesn't seem to have any meaningful affect on pictures to boot. The macro mode is utter crap and I can't even take pictures of yarn with a tripod and excellent lighting without image blur.I vastly prefer my 5 year old Powershot A95 to this camera. I'd say stay away from it unless you enjoy blurry, softly focused images. For only $30-40 more you can easily get yourself a much, much better camera.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "THIS CAMERA IS GREAT U SHOULD BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "R0Y F", "ReviewID": "RQJ0NE7N0D3NZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS CAMERA IS SOOOOOOO COOL IT TAKES GREAT PICS AND IF U HAVE SHAKEY HANDS LIKE I DO IT DONT MATTER CUZ THIS CAMERA IS SOO BA LOVE THIS THING HOPE TO HAVE IT FOR A LONG TIME.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible focus", "Author": "hcrm", "ReviewID": "R1LMC8JILX4702", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and I am completely shocked by how poor the focus is.

During our vacation, I was trying to take quick action shots of my daughter or mom, but the camera just wouldn't allow it. Because it moved slowly, I was not able to take good shots of concerts and plays that we saw. Even when you turned the camera on it takes a very long time to warm up to take a picture. After a frustrating week with the camera, I get home only to have problems uploading the pictures to my computer. I'm still not able to upload them. I thought maybe it was the memory card so I tried another one and it didn't work either. When I took the memory card to Target to print them out, many of them didn't save correctly and you can see the picture. I'm not very picky when it comes to a simple point and shoot camera.
