{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DavisMax 2x Telephoto Lens -- a Disappointment", "Author": "Chester L. Guiles", "ReviewID": "R1OQ808UNGHA7C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The lens was supposed to be compatible with my Canon 70-300 telephoto lens.  About the only level of compatibility was the screw thread to place it on the end of the lens.  The lens did not auto-focus properly with the 2x lens added, and even when I used manual focus, the images achieved were so blurry compared to what I could get with the original lens (even with a tripod and bright sunlight) as to be useless.  I got much sharper \"2x\" by simply magnifying the picture taken with the 70-300 lens itself.All in all a disappointment, and the initial reaction by the seller, that the return period had expired on the same day I received the lens, was also disappointing.  Still waiting for them to authorize return which they have now said they would do.  Not a product I would recommend to anyone.  It looked like an inexpensive way to stretch the zoom capability of this otherwise good lens, but the deteriorated quality of the images isn't worth even the very modest price of the 2x adapter.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D3MMK00"}}
