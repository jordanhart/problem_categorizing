{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Haven't managed a clear shot yet", "Author": "S. Bennett", "ReviewID": "R1WZPX1BY8WEO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was a gift for reaching a 10-year milestone at my job.  I was initially excited about it since I had done a little research and it sounded like a great, basic point-and-shoot camera.  Other than it not coming with a memory card (really, Sony?) I was happy with the size, controls, and menu options.  Then...I tried to take pictures.  Indoor pics with flash are completely overexposed, outdoor in full daylight without flash are blurry due to the camera setting the shutter speed too low (both using factory automatic settings).  I have experimented with changing the exposure compensation and the ISO and can SOMETIMES get some passable shots - but not enough for me to have this camera in my bag for snapshot use.  Additionally, red-eye reduction has NEVER worked.I'm glad to read that others have had luck with this camera; unfortunately since it was a work \"reward\" I am unable to return it, or it would have gone back in the first week.", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautifully fits the niche", "Author": "Robert M. Koretsky \"DIYer\"", "ReviewID": "R2877UVFKO04R5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got exactly what I paid for in this product, a point-and-shoot digital camera with Sony quality. It came to me very promptly at a very competitive price, was well packaged and up and running in 5 minutes. So far( about 1 month of use) it's flawless. And 12 megapixels, WOW! As opposed to the other Sony cameras I own, this one has a very simple mode selection feature( a sliding switch) that allows you to either be shooting a picture, shooting a movie, or reviewing the pictures and movies on your memory stick. The defaults for all menu choices are very well thought out, so you don't really have to tweak anything to get the best picture.  The picture quality is superb! All in all, a wonderful camera to fit a certain niche.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for the money", "Author": "Krishna Ch Vsr", "ReviewID": "R2AX31OU5YXAPA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is the best compact digital camera available at afforadable price.

Camera is sleek, easy to hold, decent quality.  It's very easy to use, your not overwhelmed by too many buttons.  The LCD screen is perfect size with pictures coming out very clear.  I haven't printed photos yet, so I cannot comment on that.  You have to purchase a Memory Stick Pro Duo because it's not included in the camera purchase.  Buy the memory stick at Amazon, they had the best prices.

I purchased one identical from a store and got fantastic results! The photos my 8-year-old son took on his vacation were outstandingly clear, even on the desert with the wind blowing.
