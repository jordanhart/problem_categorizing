It worth every penny!If you're like me, you don't want to spend more than $500( or even $300) to buy a close to perfect camera. But the quality should be good. Then this is it! Why? (1) You don't see a lot camera below $200 come with flashlight, do you? (2) It's 1.3M Pixels CCD. That means you can print 5x10 pictures. (3) PC Camera feature. (4) Compact size, easy to use.Of courese, it has some room to improve: (1) It's a battery-eating monster! Buy a lot of batteries or buy rechargebale batteries. (2) No optical zoom.(what do you expect for less $200?) (3) 8M smartcard is not enough. I've upgraded it to 64M from amazon.com for $29.(4) If it has built-in microphone would be convenient while using pc camera feature.I suggest you can do some research and compare it with other cameras in this price range. It would surprise you.(ps. if you want a little better quality, it has a sister product A201 which is about $60 more but 2.1M Pixels.)", "Date": "October 11, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great digital camera - low price", "Author": "\"thepack1995\"", "ReviewID": "R2IVXDC98EMWLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very well designed, full feature, really small digital camera at a very low price.  1.3 megapixels great for computer display and good for regular sized printed photos.

Although I am not a novice digital photographer, I am not a professional -- nor do I want to be.  I wanted a camera that would take nice pictures of friends, family and the occasional scenery shot that could be printed out or uploaded.  The Fujifilm 1.3 does this well, and prints very nice photos at photo size (I do 4x6, 5x7). The selling points (besides the price) are as follows:  1) its very small -- making it easy to take with you in a pocket, 2) it works on both my Mac OS X and Win 98/ME PC via USB -- essentially plug-n-play, 3) it takes great daylight pictures, 4) it doesn't eat batteries if you don't use the display mode -- ie: operating it like a normal camera using a viewfinder. I have not filled up the 8 MB card that came with the camera yet, although I haven't tried very hard (maybe a max of 20 photos on fine resolution in a sitting). Because I download to a laptop, I don't really need to spend additional money for a bigger card. I've also dropped it a few times, without affecting performance, so its a pretty sturdy little camera.The only issue I have with the camera is that there is a learning curve for most of the features that may cause you to lose good photo opportunities at first.  You have to read the manual to know how the display works, and how to set the camera for different sorts of lighting schemes. I blurred a few photos because I didn't realize the macro switch had turned on while it was in my bag, and didn't discover this until later when I downloaded them. I haven't quite mastered the various flash settings and took a low-light, indoor shot from about 8 feet away that isn't great. If I were to put some time in learning the display functions, rather that setting it on \"auto\" and using the viewfinder all the time, I might become quicker at changing the settings for different lighting situations. As it is now, the camera is fine for my uses, and I can usually brighten the \"mistakes\" in Photoshop.", "Date": "August 12, 2002"}, {"Title": "Love this camera.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1M6B4WEFNOQ60", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great consumer grade camera. I have 2 SLRs, and 2 Nikon/Olympus One Shot cameras and for quick snaps, and sending pictures online - i'm hooked. The 1.3MPix will fill a 1024x768 screen with sharp graphics. So far this camera's color accuracy amazes me. It is pocket sized, simple to use, and the price is tuff to beat. Most of my shooting is outdoors and it works well in a variety of lighting conditions - i usually shoot people with the flash. The finepix PC software is basic. If you don't like it just plug in the Camera's USB port, and open the USB Device in Windows Explorer and use what ever you want. Buy rechargable batteries, you can maybe get 60 or so snaps with disposable's included.In my opinion the next logical upgrade above this camera would be an optical zoom, and 2-3 MPix.", "Date": "April 29, 2002"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R3V99CW8I88ZKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is actually my first digital camera, but based on all of its features, I would say that I won't be buying another one for a long time. And, for under $200, it is probably the best camera out there. Webcam feature is fun & easy to use, movie mode is nice, and it takes crystal clear pictures, with different flash modes, self-timer to allow you to get in the shot, and easy USB connection to PC/Mac. The only thing I would suggest is to get some rechargeable batteries and/or an AC adapter when you're at your comp, because it eats up AA's pretty quickly. The 1.6\" LCD screen is very nice, because it lets you see your pics immediately, to see if you want to keep them. Also, compact enough to fit in your pocket!

It only lasted about 6 months and just quit working.  I was lucky enough to have purchased a 1 year replacement and got this one instead.  It is also a 1.3 Megapixel but for some reason the pictures are just plain better.  This camera is smaller and more attractive then the Sipix I had before.  It's very simple to use and the the controls on the camera are pretty much self explanatory.  Downloading is a snap with the provided software.  You just plug your camera into the USB cable and it launches the software for viewing/downloading.  The LCD screen on the back lets you view pictures and video taken by browsing one by one or viewing in a thumbnail mode.  The camera takes 20 second videos that are a bit grainy and without sound but I have spliced them together and added music and made some cute movies to send to the family.

Normal resolution is more than adequate for the web and e-mail. Fine resolution results in quality good enough for at least 4*6\" prints at your local Kits Cameras or similar. The non-audio 20 seconds of video is a bonus IMO. With WindowsXP (Home or Pro) on your PC you'll find this camera very easy to use, it is very straightforward to publish pictures to the web or automatically shrink and e-mail them instead. Only 2 downsides that I've found;1. The appears to be a tendency for dust to creep into the LCD disply area. Cosmetic only.2. Battery life w/ LCD use is relatively low. So, don't use the LCD for every photo or get the latest rechargeable AA batteries.

It works with both my laptop and desktop computers, so you do not have to worry about using up your batteries or buying an ac adapter to transfer the images and video.

As for my experience with the battery life, If you don't use the display, the battery life is pretty good.  I do recomend rechargable batteries and a power adapter.  Use the power adapter ESPICALLY when you hook the camera up to a PC or use the video mode.  I still have not tried the web cam function, but if it's like the other features, functions of this camera, it will be very nice.  My ONLY complaint with this camera is the self-timer.  Once you set the self-timer and take a picture, you have to set the self-timer again if you want to take another picture using the self-timer function.  I have owned another digital camera (Polaroid) and while the pictures it took are NOT as good as this camera (FujiFilm).  The Polaroid camera had a self-timer setting that would stay on while you took as many self-timed pictures as you wanted to, then all you did was to turn off the self-timer function and go about your business.

And so far this one is the best.  It gets good battery life compared to other cameras.  The people that complained about battery life have obviously not tried the competition. This camera also takes good pictures, is easy to use, easy to download pictures to computer, and this camera is very small!  Not quite as small as the Canon Elph, but close! and for less than half the price.  The only negative about this camera,  is problems with indoor pictures.  Without fail, at least half of my indoor pictures have random white spots in them.  They range from pinhead to quarter sized and are randomly placed throughout the picture.  I called Fuji and they said it was normal and it was caused by the flash reflecting off of dust and airborne particles.  They told me it happens to a lot of digital cameras.  I have owned several digital cameras, and so far this is the only one that has done this.  Upon further research, I found an article linking this problem with the distance of the flash to the lens.  As you can see from the A101's picture, they are only a few millimeters apart on this camera.  The problem is so bad, that now I take 4 pictures of everything so I can make sure once will not have white spots in it.

Perhaps not the best camera available, but it's damn good value for the money.We haven't tried the Fuji software (we've got photoshop, iMovie, etc. so we're not interested in the Fuji stuff) but with the USB connection it just plugs into our Mac and mounts on the desktop as a disc - easy as pie - just copy the images to the computer and that's it. Words of warning - don't try to trash the files on the camera through your computer - crash!On the downside, it eats batteries like mad (it only uses two, not the typical four) and the optional digital camera accesory kit is not worth the money and in my case the rechargable batteries and charger were faulty.", "Date": "December 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "Perfect Mid-Priced Camera", "Author": "Eric Rosario \"BooBee\"", "ReviewID": "R4UCOXMCQ1IWC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the Kodak DC 3200 and sold it because it over exposed pictures that where too close. The Fuji FinePix A101 is by far one of the finest camera's. It is very small and fits in your pocket compared to other cheaper brands that are bulky and large.The LCD screen looks choppy in dim light but trust me the pictures although look choppy in the display they are excellently clear and sharp when you display them on your PC. The over exposure problem I had with the Kodak from the flash with pictures taken at close range is now a thing of the past. The A101 takes pictures up close and although they may seem over exposed in the LCD they are premium quality when you view them on your PC.I would recommend this camera to anyone. I've even suggested it to family members telling them that I would buy it from them if they did not like it. I'm that sure that you will like it.

The other camera took blurry pictures & not nearly as brigtht & colorful.  I took it back & exchanged it for this model again & have been happy ever since.  Yes - the batteries do go bad quick but the previous reviews offer good advice that I have heeded: buy a charger/renew batteries; don't use the lcd whenever possible. I didn't get the a/c adaptor cord because I figured the battery charger with 2 sets of battereis was all I needed.  The idea was to stay cheap.

I have owned it for almost 2 years now and use it all the time. Last Christmas I thought I wanted to upgrade so I bought a 3 megapixel Kodak camera and ended up returning it because it wasn't as good as my 1.3 megapixel Fuji. This camera takes wonderful macro pictures which is essential if you sell online, the Kodak took lousy macro pictures. The Kodak also did this weird double flash thing so when I tried to take pictures of my cats I always got them with their eyes closed. I have no trouble at all with my Fuji. One flash and you've got the picture. I tell you, If I ever did decide to upgrade it would definitely be a Fuji.The pictures from this camera are fabulous! I use it for e-mail pictures, prints, and online auction pictures. It's great for all of those. When I got my camera I had in mind to mostly use it for auction pictures but it turned out to be even more useful than that. I take tons of pictures of friends, family, and my pets. Then I e-mail pictures to those friends and family. I also make prints (sometimes through an online / store service sometimes at home with the printer) for scrapbboking and they very good. I will admit that if you look really close they aren't as good as prints from a film camera, but I find the convenience of the digital worth it.All in all, if you only have about $100 to spend on a digital camera I HIGHLY recommend this one!!!", "Date": "August 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Beautiful!", "Author": "\"ckirkg\"", "ReviewID": "R284QXPQSODXKD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had mine for about a month now and have had a wonderful time with it.

But to me this is a plus point since you are unlikely to produce off-focused results by accidentally pointing at the wrong subject. It is a basic camera and has a nine zone metering system. but produces pretty dark pictures even in day light. This is due to the small aperture that comes with this camera. Fujifilm prob used the same AE exposure program from a camera with a bigger aperture!Hence i suggest using it in Manual mode with a EV compensation of +0.6 to +0.9 for day conditions and +1.5 for in the shadow and night conditions. Anyhow this camera was not supposed to take night pics. Hence night pics are pretty much restricted to night Portraits. Landscape mode has to be achieved with Tripod.Colour is vivid, but i see pics from Olympus C-1 (similar class) reproducing more faithful colours when indoor. Outdoor colours are fine for the fuji. With flourescent lamp indoor, you have to use the customised white balance mode. I normally choose the bulb icon.The \"movie\" mode is for fun and don't take it too seriously. The software that comes with it can help you to make some fun videos akin to Charlie Chaplin movie. But you must use another software to remove the avi audio component to achieve better effects with your own sound / music library.On the whole, Best Camera in 1.3Mega Pix Category. Fuji should dominate in this category.", "Date": "May 27, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great pictures - easy to use", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R14U81C6GIN1DY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for first time digigal buyers. It's light weight, takes great pictures and is so easy to use. One thing I really like is that the \"lag\" time after you take the picture is non-existent. It's the closest to using a regular 35mm that I've come across. If I could stress to all first time digital buyers, please expect to buy rechargable batteries and a larger smart media card and you will be set. Digitals ALL eat up the batteries. And the media card is an investment ... since you use it over and over again, unlike film.
