I had bought Wansview's NCH-536MW a few days before, and although very impressive on the hardware side, the installed firmware made this camera unusable, furthermore it took a while to convince the company to send me a firmware update.Anyway, the firmware on my new NCH-532MW is not buggy as far as I can see. The only thing this firmware is really missing in my opinion is an option to set day/night mode manually (the NCH-536MW can do that).Anyway, a simple hardware hack to keep the IR on continuously would be to permanently cover the light sensor under the camera's lens with some black tape. And a hack to keep the IR off continuously would probably require opening the camera case and disconnecting the power to the LEDs.However, there was a real technical problem with this camera, which almost made me send it back. The light sensor that checks the surrounding light, and triggers the switching between day (IR LEDs off, IR cut filter engaged) and night (IR LEDs on, IR cut filter disengaged), seems to be set much too sensitive. This means that day mode is still engaged, when it is already too dark to see anything on the camera, and night mode (IR LEDs) is only activated if the room is pitch black). Since the camera uses an automatic IR cut filter in day mode, a separate IR source that would come on earlier also doesnt help. Anyway, I tried to simply put a small piece of adhesive tape on the sensor and paint it with a black marker, so less light would pass through to the sensor. This works very nicely, and now night mode is engaged earlier.It's not a perfect camera, but for this price a definite must (I'll probably buy another one) - if one doesnt mind a bit of troubleshooting - which in the ideal world is something Wansview should do and not the customer... And of course - as with any other Wansview product - no hope for firmware updates, no download links on their website, and from my experience with my other Wansview camera, a pain to get new firmware from customer service, even if they have newer firmware.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not recommended", "Author": "JG", "ReviewID": "R2SULRG6XSKXA6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Virtually identical to Agasio A603W but with older firmware and software.The hardware quality is decent. It will work OK with the included ActiveX software but be aware this class of camera does not handle outdoor lighting conditions well.I wanted to use it with iSpy software as a VLC stream. A guy has gotten this to work (search on \"wansview NCH-536MW and NCH-532MW work now\") by upgrading the firmware. The mfr instructions plus his instructions were not very helpful and I could not get it to work. It would say the firmware was upgraded, but the version number would not change.These products are very frustrating. They are 90% of the way to usable, but the manufacturers and/or US distributors will not make the effort to document and support them.The only solution seems to be moving up in price. I am trying a Vivotek IP8332 ($300) then will try a Nelly's Surplus EYEsurv ESIPMP3-1 cam ($500 with lens). Nelly's is very responsive to email and has rewritten all the documentation.
