Winschel", "ReviewID": "R36XCW7L11G04V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE 4/2014 - I have found a significant drawback with this unit that has really taken the lustre off of the camera and has left me very disappointed.  The unit stinks in low light.  It will hunt for focus and not find it, flash or no flash.  It doesnt even have to be very low lighting conditions.  I have used other canon and nikon units and they do not have the same issue.  The camera has been getting significantly less usage since that.  I still really like it for daylight shots but look elsewhere or try it before you keep it if standard indoor room lighting levels are important to you.  If it were not for the lenses purchased I would have returned it to costco and looked for something else.Original review:Purchased this unit from costco after researching reviews on comparable Nikon and Canon units.  All but one of the tech reviews raved about this camera.  The plus side is the unit is \"weather proof\" (still not sure how that is defined).  The reviews in general favored this unit in overall image quality over the Canon T5i rebel which was the other unit I was comparing it to.  This was less expensive than the Canon and weatherproof.  Out of the box the unit is very easy to pick up and start shooting with if you have any experience with DSLR cameras.  Very intuitive menu design.  Overall build feels very solid and fits my hands well.  Photo quality is amazing in the little bit of playing I have done with it.  I need to work on learning the advanced features of the unit (which are many) to do a better job on exposure.  I was seeing my subjects under exposed a bit in daylight.  Playing with some of the settings has helped. I don't fault the camera for this, but my relative inexperience.  I coupled this two lens set with a fast 50 lens for portrait shooting.  Going off topic: I LOVE this lens.  First prime lens and am really impressed with the bokeh effect I am capable of producing, nothing less than stunning with this camera.  The combination has really been a huge step up in what I can produce over my D50.  Going off topic again:I also added a class 10 eye-fi card 16gb for instant photo transfer.  Love it.  Third unit and to me they are very easy to setup and use, never had an issue with them. I have seen nothing negative yet about the camera.  Like the color combinations.  Got mine in white and it looks classy.  I need to dig in and learn how to really unleash the potential of the camera.I am excited about the \"weather proof\" aspects of the design and need to learn more about it.  I purchased an Olympus Tough TG1 last year for less than perfect and underwater conditions and it does the job it's designed to do well but lacks the control and overall image quality of a DSLR.  Being able to take this outside without paranoia over any exposure to the elements weighed heavily in my decision over the Canon and Nikon (I was really leaning towards the Canon after having used it).  Just make sure that the lenses you are going to use carry the weather proof rating also. The fast 50 does not.I am really looking forward to learning this camera better and have no regrets over buying it sight unseen over the canon and nikons.  So far I am amazed with the quality of shots that I have produced. I will update this later when I get a little more time with the unit.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "The perfect first time DSLR", "Author": "Laurence83", "ReviewID": "R1N05O6T4T24TH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just finished 2 years of shooting all over the world with my Canon EOS 60D.  That camera was the best DSLR that I had handled in a long time, and bested Nikons 5200 by a long shot in my opinion.  I now shoot wildlife and outdoor sporting photography and needed something that could stand up to the elements and provide high quality photos.  This Pentax K30 and K50 series of cameras fit this bill perfectly, and after much consideration I went with the K50.  I also purchased another WR lens in 200mm to accompany this one.  The K50 body and both lenses have proven to exceed my expectations of a camera and lens system in this price range.  These products easily compete with Canons and Nikons that sell for twice the cost.  All specs aside, the focusing is fast and precise, the options are very extensive but lack in some areas compared to other makes, and the end result has pleased me over and over again without fail.  If you need a camera to take on a rafting trip, rainy day, or want something that can hold up to dust storms in Iraq/Afghanistan, this is the clear choice for you.  As a military contractor and avid amateur photographer, this camera suits my needs perfectly, and produces images at equal quality to my EOS 60D which cost me $1200.  I paid $450 for this kit because the seller sold me a returned product and Amazon provided me with a 20% refund due to that.  My point and shoot cost more than that, so I am beyond happy with this purchase and look forward to years of shooting with this very competitively priced and engineered marvel of a DSLR.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pentax makes great cameras - don't think everything is all Canon and Nikon", "Author": "MC", "ReviewID": "R1GS3MX1I5JX6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for over a month and love it!  A professional photographer recommended it to me and at first I was a little hesitant because it was hard to find in stores and it wasn't as popular as Canon or Nikon models. But I'm very happy I went with a Pentax.  It's the first time I've bought a DSLR and so far, it's been pretty easy to use.  I'm still playing around with some of the settings, but overall, it's been great.  I had been using a Canon Rebel (that I basically had inherited) and this takes MUCH better pictures.  Brighter colors, better flash, faster, etc. My main purpose of this camera is to take photos for my child's elementary school yearbook and I'm really impressed by how they look so far.  It has a lot of great filters and effect settings and I find the menu is easy to use.  I also love that it's weatherproof.

Ramnes", "ReviewID": "R6KW216PBF2R8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been shooting with a K200D for about 4 years. While it was a good camera, it needed improvement in a few areas, specifically high ISO performance, focus speed and accuracy, and live view. The K50 offered all these things.With about 500 shots through the new camera, I can say it has exceeded my expectations, especially in the focus and live view areas. Low light performance is much better than the old camera but still not what the high end units offer.I also got the 18-135 lens and LOVE that as well. It has become my go to lens for almost all situations, replacing the 55-300 which I used to use about 80 percent of the time. That lens still performs well on the new camera but the shorter zoom is much more versatile and very sharp when stopped down one or two stops.The controls are different than the K200D, especially the two control wheels rather than one. I am getting used to this and will love it when it becomes second nature. I also like the quicker access to ISO and other settings that is available.Am using the AA battery adapter with Energizer Lithiums and continue to get excellent performance from them.Very pleased, would buy the camera again and would recommend to a friend.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Alternative that Isn't", "Author": "bsamcash", "ReviewID": "R3Q6362N7KQXGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A simply spectacular tool. I am a Pentaxian for sure, but I have used many other brands including the Big Two, and nothing comes close at this price point. You get a modern update of the highly acclaimed 16 MP Sony sensor in a fully weather-sealed body with a matching (high quality) kit lens for under $700!The body is unbelievable rugged for being plastic. It makes every other DSLR in its price range feel like a cheap toy. Plus, the grip is hands down the best I have ever felt at any price. It hugs my hand and locks in place--no need for a hand strap. The grip and solid, unyielding body are why I chose this model over the K-5II.At low ISOs, the older sensor is on par or maybe a little noisier than competing models, but when the lights go down, this thing shines. Zero noise gain when well exposed, but if you have to push say a 3200 RAW image, you will be blown away at the headroom the K-50 has in its 12 bit files. And if you can find noise (by pushing), it's not that gross banding we are used to seeing with cameras that shoot for marking megapixels rather than image quality. It is a gentle, film-like fine grain in very large prints. And this is for color, if you're converting to B&W;, you can take this thing all the way through its ISO range and make beautiful small prints.The menu system is as near perfect as I can trust engineers to make it. They either are, or work with photographers. Everything you need is one to three clicks away. I tried using a D5200 recently, and I couldn't even figure out how to set it to RAW, I had to look it up. Then ISO took me five minutes. It was ridiculous. I guarantee you will not have this problem with any Pentax DSLR from 2010 to today.The lens is pretty brilliant for a kit lens. It is weather-sealed and solid. The zoom is very well dampened. It feels high-quality. I have used many kit lenses in the past from many manufacturers, and this one is the best. It even beats Panasonic's micro four-thirds kit lens in build. Image quality wise, it's about on par with others; by that I mean it needs to be stopped down to shine. But it is very sharp throughout the range when it has plenty of light.Now for the bad: The out-of-camera JPEGs suck. Pentax has never had great JPEG processing. This sensor begs to be left alone. Shoot RAW and use a calibrated monitor to edit the images (it records in DNG, so there's no worry there).Moreover, this body needs good glass. Please don't be a hipster and buy a high-quality camera and only use the kit lens. This is a serious tool, not a toy, so invest in decent lenses. Luckily, the K-mount has among the most expansive and diverse lens collection in photography (it's why I shoot Pentax). But you don't have to break the bank, just go to your favorite flea market or internet auction site and look for old manual lenses. You'll be surprised and the quality that can be had for under 50 USD.So there it is. My very first ever Amazon product review. Yes, I love this camera that much. It is not just an alternative brand. And this is not an alternative camera at all because the competition doesn't come close at this price.Bottom line: If you are looking for your first DSLR, or if you're considering switching mounts because you're growing tired of the half-adding and broken promises the Big Two have been accused of lately, you cannot go wrong with the Pentax K-50.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Extraordinary Value and Camera", "Author": "Joshua Sadinsky", "ReviewID": "R2S1P6EI5YNXYV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great price for an intermediate level DSLR.

I've probably only taken about 500 pictures with the camera so far, but the quality with the stock 18-50 lens has been nice. I'm sure there are many camera features of which I've yet to take full advantage. I just spent another $400 to pick up the 55-300 WR HD lens for this, so I do recommend spending the extra $100 or so when you purchase it and making sure the one you get comes with both the 18-50 and 50-200 lenses - which will likely keep you from having to spend the extra money to buy the 55-300mm lens - at least for a while.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent upgrade", "Author": "wjo", "ReviewID": "RVGQFBLVVGDMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I dropped my Pentax K2000 on the pavement it set me up to have to buy a replacement.

It's honestly a better camera than any of the entry level ones from the other manufacturers and is right up there with some of the mid-level ones. I'm a Nikon fanboy but this Pentax has split my allegiance. It's honestly a better camera than the Nikon D7000 and maybe even the D7100 depending on how much you value bragging about megapixels. I'll just skip ahead. Pros: weather sealing, 100% pentaprism, build quality (not a toy like a Rebel and I honestly think it feels better than the Nikon mid-levels), screw drive for old lenses, really nice video in my opinion. Cons: no battery grip (why why why), lens selection is a bit lacking and they need to make some fast and affordable WR lenses, it should ship with a weather sealed body cap for transport. Other than that I can't really gripe much about it. More megapixels might be nice and it actually looks better in person than it does in most of the photos online.

Rana", "ReviewID": "RGOUANMDU7TTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Pentax camera, this replacing my older Pentax K-r which has and continues to serve me faithfully. The Pentax k-50 however builds upon the older design by adding several additional upgrades. Some Pros/Cons.Pros:- Being fully weather sealed.- 16.3-Megapixel CMOS Sesnsor- In Body, Sensor-Shift Shake Reduction. This is something you find on cameras at twice the price point of the K-50. It also means that the hundreds of thousands of manual lens for Pentax dating back some 40 years (including all K-Mount and Screw type mount) can be used in this camera with the senor shake reduction features.- Very intuitive easy to use interface. You can pick it up and start shooting right away.- Very fast auto-focus acquisition, even in low light. The AF mode has programmable zones so you can meter your shots depending on the environment.- Can shoot at ISO 51000, but that results in high levels of 'noise' in the picture. ISO levels up to 12800 should be sufficient for most shots.- Has 11 preset customizing options for JPEGs in camera. Also has individual settings to tweak 7 other setting like saturation, hue, contras, B&W; etc.- Battery adapter allows the camera to run off AA batteries, though you should ideally use rechargeable NiCad or LiOn batteries. It will chew up regular alkaline AAs.- The build quality and hand grip are solid, all the buttons are placed logically can can be accessed by just your right hand on the fly. Good tactile feel on all the buttons.- Full frame pentaprism viewfinder, basically what you see is what you get.- Full 1080p video.- Customizeable in dozens and dozens of different colors from the Pentax website.The Cons- The continuous Hi mode where you can shoot 30 JPEG frames at 6 FPS has above average loud shutter noise.- There is only a small built in mono microphone located at the top of the flash when shooting video. The sound quality is ok for shooting indoors, but picks up excessive ambient wind noise when shooting outdoors. As of now, there are no attachments for third party microphones.- Pentax was recently acquired by Ricoh Imaging, so long term support is a little suspect.It's a shame Pentax does not spend more on marketing like the big boys (Nikon/Canon). However, if you are willing to go against the conventional trend and are not fully committed to a DSLR system, you cant get a better value than the Pentax. This camera has features that are not available in many others in its price point. The ideal comparison here is with the Nikon D7100 or the Canon EoS 7D, and while the Nikon has a few upgrades like higher MP, the Pentax has it beat in all other features (AF, LiveView, Shooting Modes, In Camera Editing, in body Image Stabilization). In addition, the Pentax also costs nearly 50% less and can use any previous K or S type lens mount. Pentax also has a very active user community online that offer support and guidance, which takes some of the fear out of them being acquired by Ricoh. Actually the biggest knock on this camera is that it is in many ways functionally similar to the K-30, so you might be able to find a better deal on Amazon on a K-30 bundle.

This camera is perfect for people like me. I was a little skeptical about buying a big camera, as I prefer something small that can be carried in pocket, but I eventually got used to it with the help of the carry bag.Good Speed, a touch geeky with features which let you control a lot of things and also has user friendly modes in cases where you don't know what needs to be done. A good buy for the price and getting weather proofing is a big perk. I used it mainly outdoors in different weather conditions including rain, no change in how it performs.I recommend this camera, Before taking it on a trip I suggest to practice using this camera with its modes, settings and shortcuts in your living room with different light conditions to check what different modes do and how controls work. You can see how pictures change with different settings. You will start liking the camera with more and more use.Best Feature - Motor controlled Focus in lens.Comparing with Nikon D3200 or D5200. Pentax is a better camera for the price.Comparing with Cannon - Higher end models of Cannon which cost more than $1500 are better than Pentax K-50.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent DSLR", "Author": "Big Dad", "ReviewID": "R3M73JQQ0HEMFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son.

The K-50 was a camera that I had been looking forward to for a while, as the weatherproofing and value for the money intrigued me. When the camera arrived, however, I found myself less than thrilled to play with it.Perhaps it was the kit lens or just my copy of the camera in particular (I got it from warehouse deals, so I'm guessing someone else had bought and returned it) but it seemed to hunt for autofocus in casual indoor shooting, something my Nex 6 and D90 don't really do as often. That aside, the camera itself seems well built and sturdy, but it just doesn't feel substantial, take that how you will. I can certainly appreciate the lack of heft when thinking about lugging it around my neck all day, but I also like to feel that my camera has some mass to it. It feels very nikon D40-esque. This is admittedly a personal preference, and I think my four star review demonstrates that my bias does not reflect poorly on the camera. It simply isn't the camera for me. Image quality was good and the lcd display was bright and easy to read. Controls are well-placed and menus are simple and intuitive  (unlike those of the Nex which are terrible). Overall, a very good camera with a lot of features for a good price. Unless you are like me and have some arbitrary and ultimately pointless predefined notion of what a camera should feel like this would be a very good choice for almost anyone.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "This one stands out in a crowed.", "Author": "John Blaicher", "ReviewID": "RU1U710SRYA8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is rugged and weather resistant and I love the color!

After a long research I decided to choose Pentax as the brand to start my DSLR journey. My happiness lasted for only 3 weeks. In the fourth week I started to face issues with the mirror in front of the sensor. It would get stuck when clicking a photo causing even the autofocus to fail because the mirror is in the wrong position. Change to the Live View mode and things work fine but while trying to click through the view finder the mirror gets stuck and sometimes the camera itself hangs with no response at all. I chose to differ from the general crowd and have to repent on my decision. I am currently outside US and by the time I return back I would have crossed 30 day mark, so will be in no position to return the camera. Very disappointing. I wish I would have chosen to stick to the more conventional brands like Canon or Nikon.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Photos", "Author": "Michele L.
