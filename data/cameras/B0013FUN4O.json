I really like that I can charge the battery inside the camera just by plugging in the supplied cable into any USB port. The HD video is better then my mini DV camera. I need three software programs to convert the videos and burn them on a DVD, but the results are great.The supplied Owners manual left out a lot of information. You really need to go to the Kodak internet site and read the extended Users Guide online to learn all the features of this camera.I'm really happy with this camera and would recommend it to anyone. Don't forget to order a few 8GB SD cards and the extra batteries and external charger.Sandisk 8GB SDHC Memory Card (SDSDB-8192, Bulk Package)2 BATTERY+CHARGER FOR KODAK KLIC-7004 V1073 V1273 M1033", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "KINNY", "Author": "ulla \"URSULA MONEY\"", "ReviewID": "RJ3YHB9GZIH8U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this camera will not open and does not have a customer brochure, I wonder if I can receive one for this camera", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kodak cam n", "Author": "prat cam", "ReviewID": "R1PT3JC226L29L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was an amazing experience buyi.g from this guy.

Great picture quality with high resolution. 16:9 resolution if using to make video slideshows. 720p video resolution a great bonus, although video quality could be better. Video quality is much better at the 640x480 resolution it also offers.At the end of a trip this spring to Disney World Florida the camera had issues after a day at Clearwater Beach. When the camera was powered on the lens mechanism would come out but seconds later the lens would automatically retract and the camera would power down. I was sad to see the camera seem to reach the end of its life.Fast forward nine months. I was ready to buy a new point-and-shoot camera today. I did another search on the internet about the off as soon as it is turned on problem with the M1033. I read on a forum that the issue is that the lens is detecting dust that has intruded into the lens mechanism and to try blowing on and around the lens mechanism. I tried this with a hair dryer on cold shot and sure enough it worked! :) Other posters had blown with a can of air or with air from a scuba tank at a scuba shop. With the hair dryer I blew on the camera a bit before turning the camera on, then kept blowing as I turned it on, pointing it directly into the circles around the lens. The camera stayed on and could take photos! I wasn't quite out of the woods however as it had trouble focusing on all the photo shots. I turned it off and back on a second time and the focusing problem went away. Photos were good, video good. Works great now. Very happy to get more life out of this great camera.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good basic camera", "Author": "Dale", "ReviewID": "R30FOU7TASKC4X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had this camera previously, but my kid dropped it with the lens out and jammed the lens.  Found the same one on Amazon, as I already had several extra batteries and accessories for it.This is a good all around point and shot slim camera.  It does have a recurring annonyance where every once in a while it will pause on \"processing...\" for a while after taking a picture and prevent you from taking pictures for 10-30 seconds.  The picture quality is mostly decent, but it does take a while to focus correctly sometimes.  Movie quality @720p is decent, but nothing great (acceptable for YouTube).I have a Nikon SLR that I use for sporting and pictures that I need to be higher quality.  However, this camerca works for small point and shoot situations when the SLR is not convienient to carry around.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price!", "Author": "ametter", "ReviewID": "R2KR0I7L6DIUNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My camera came on time. I got a great deal on it because it was referbished. I have had the camera for almost 3 months now. I use it quite a bit and have had no problems yet. It came with the charger that also converts to a USB cord. if you have wifi you can also push the share button on the camera and send your videos and photos to an email address. The pictures are clear and quality is good for a cheaper older model.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "DISAPPOINTED", "Author": "tanmanmom", "ReviewID": "R20TYWAPCEKZ3G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "At first we were impressed with this camera.  It was a gift to my daughter and she loved how cute it was and easy to use.  Then the camera died.  It would not turn on or power up.  I spent hours on the internet researching and eventually chatted with Kodak for over 40 minutes.  I was told the camera needed to be sent in for repairs.  The instructions for mailing alone were ridiculous.  I then received 2 different e-mails from Kodak indicating that the warranty was void.  I called and spent over 45 minutes on the phone with a Kodak representative.  She told me everything from the camera was damaged to I needed a proof of purchase to fix it.  She also couldn't guarantee my camera could be fixed, but quoted $55.00 for parts, labor and shipping.  I am so frustrated and disappointed with Kodak I will never buy another product.  Good bye Kodak!!!!!!!", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Made to last...", "Author": "Leigh M.

This camera died while still under warranty; however, our daughter was overseas visiting family and we were not able to return the camera until she returned home yesterday (1 year, 2 days).  HP support had us on hold indefinitely, so we hung up after 30 minutes and sent an email.  Disappointed that the camera lasted barely 12 months.  Our daughter takes good care of her property; this item was not mis-handled or abused.
