L. \"WOT lover\"", "ReviewID": "R5D9XURDMXVWZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has a very nice picture, only drawback is it has a small field of view.I replaced a cheap plastic model that had a very wide field of my front porch. When I put this in the same location, it barely showed anything, so I had to move it 15 feet away to see the area I wanted.However, that far away made identifying people difficult unless you knew them. Not sure if an ID could be made from a screen capture from that distance.To get a good face shot, you'd have to mount it so low it could easily be stolen.I bought 4 of these, one has a halo around the frame when the IR is on. Annoying but acceptable.The IR works great, one on my driveway can see over 50 feet to my neighbors steps. The one in my backyard shows almost the entire 40 X 60 lot.Not sure about the weatherability, it says it is NOT waterproof and not to mount it where it can get rained on. Finding a place out of direct rain may be hard and might not suit your apps.All in all, this is a very good bargain...BUT,If you need multiple cams, buy one to see if the view is what you want.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Quality Camera", "Author": "James Abraham", "ReviewID": "RWCUU23HA0X6E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am truly amazed on the quality of this camera. I mounted it about 7 feet high to be able to see down a narrow path about 85 foot long. It surprised me how sharp and clear the picture was even past 100 foot. Even at night I was able to see half way down the path with no problem!If you need a good quality camera I would recommend this one.

After arriving I found that my Standard RCA/power CCTV cables would not work for this camera.  This camera, and the cable that comes with it, have a S type 4 pin Din connector on the camera end.  So beware, if buying as a replacement, or if you need to replace this camera in the future, the Cable that came with it will not work with a standard CCTV Camera.  But because of the good picture quality, I decided to climb into the attic and ADD this non standard cable next to the existing RCA cable to the camera site.  And for the price, it was not worth trying to find another with standard CCTV connectors.  The 3 stars is not for the quality, but not for making it clear that it is a non-standard system, only one small picture of the cable barely shows the non-standard connector, and one small text indication of the non-standard connection at the end of the ad.  All other pictures of the camera do not show the cord.**********UPDATE ***********Purchased August 2010 - Dead March 2011  Green color failed within months of installation, showing Green as a faded blue color.  Camera was under a 2 foot overhang in a north facing protected location.  Failed after approx. 8 months use during a very dry period (no rain in weeks - Florida)  .", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not enough of what I was looking for", "Author": "Amazonian Shopper", "ReviewID": "RD1S8ZBB0FRQN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ordered this camera based on reviews, price, night vision capability, and outdoor/weather-resisting capability. We have other cameras that are higher quality, which we used to compare it to, on the same playback equipment.The good: these are some of the cheapest indoor/outdoor day/night cameras you'll find. They are perfectly sized, and not asthetically displeasing. When watching them live on a TV they provide a decently sharp picture, for more than 20 feet during the day. At night it's range is still good, but slightly less than day.The bad: these are some of the cheapest indoor/outdoor day/night cameras you'll find. Although when watching it live on TV, the picture is clear, when played back from our high quality DVR the picture was unacceptably pixellated and poor in general. The tech pro in my household tells me it's something to do with the lines of resolution played on a TV vs stored by a DVR as recorded by the camera, though I could be paraphrasing that information EXTREMELY wrong! Something about alternating lines of resolution? All I know is the playback from our other cameras is much, much more normal and viewable. If you're not going to need to record and review your camera's history and just observe someplace live, these would be fine. But that's not what we needed. You could make out basic shapes in playback, but I can't promise you'd be able to tell the difference between human and neanderthal, for example.Also, the color of things recorded by this camera during daylight is crazy. Most things (watched live or in playback) look like they're in some weird Willy Wonka - Technicolor world of freakishness. Especially anything green, like trees. Green in this camera is automatically translated into a bright pale fuschia. Weird! We tried to adjust this unsuccessfully, and we are typically not a technically-challenged household. Based on the price, we would have kept it despite the color issue if the playback quality had not been so horrible. I wanted to be able to recognize facial features, which was obviously not going to be possible.The only other flaw is the slightly limited field of vision of this camera. It was much narrower than I thought it would be, but not so narrow that it's unusable. I'd estimate the field of vision is about 5 to 6 feet up close, 15 to 20 feet at its max further out.Oh wait, one more flaw ... as other reviewers have mentioned, there is a warning that comes with this camera saying it cannot be left in the rain or constantly exposed to the elements, even though it is labeled on the box etc as weather-resistant. My guess is they are probably pretty weather resistant, but the lawyers made 'em put those warnings in the instructions. That said, I wouldn't expect them to last a lifetime in constant rain or snow. Though they do feel sturdily made.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Video quality is poor.", "Author": "Curt Cook", "ReviewID": "R2VELWG2QNV0WC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was surprised at the low quality of video.

Night vision is crisp and clear up to 20 feet. During the day I am able to view more than a block away. Camera will not show true color if facing the sun, you will see different hues of pink. But facing away from the sun it's fine. I would have given it five stars if it were not for the fact that it says weatherproof, but then it states do not use in rain.
