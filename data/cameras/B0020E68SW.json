Kind of disappointed cause it would of madeit appear more real. Nevertheless for the price it does the job. I think there wereother options to buy that had blinking light capability.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "These cameras got my message across loud and clear", "Author": "Sharon Snodgrass", "ReviewID": "R1GSGC6D9E17O8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was a little worried about making my real cameras visible to vandals but wanted them to see that there was cameras on the property. Before we got these camera we could see snoopers walking round our home testing doors and windows and by placing these little babies out in plain site with the warning signs we have not seen a single snooper. They work. The signs fade in the sunlite but the one in the shade hasn't faded at all. I drilled a hole in the bases and ran the plastic tubes though them, tied a knot in them and mounted them to the house. They look real enough. I plan to wire them with real LEDs soon to make them appear even more real but I'm very happy with them the way they are.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0020E68SW"}}
