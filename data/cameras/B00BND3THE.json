I saw many stores putting this particular camera on sale and thought before I went to a store, I would check Amazon out to see what deal they may have.  In the end, this package along with the price was too good to pass up.  The shipping was quick, the packaging was good and all the items are being put to use.I was able to put the camera in action almost immediately at a motor sports event and it passed every test, outside of the puny clips that are supposed to hold the strap in place.  However, a couple of good knots solved that problem.  Considering I only had a few minutes with the camera before putting it to use, I got great photos that were used for stories.The camera is friendly for both novice and pro users and I am glad I was able to finally purchase a camera like this.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera. Not everything pictured was received.", "Author": "Cinnamon Hollow", "ReviewID": "R1RYMICOHLBQ1T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a complete and total camera newbie so I can't give any major technical reviews here but I can give my point opinion of the photos i've taken.I'm giving this product 4 stars because not everything was as pictured. For the battery charger, I received a smaller charger that didn't have the car charger with it. So it's not as pictured.For the camera, though, I am very pleased. t is very easy to use for a beginner and has many features. I was able to start taking pictures right away and the are all crisp and clear. I am a blogger so I need photos to emphasize my posts and the Nikon Coolpix L820 gives me exactly what I need. I was originally looking for a DSLR but soon realized they are a bit more advanced than I am ready for. So this bridge camera was the right choice.I like that I can take up close photos, landscape shots when we are traveling, panoramic photos, portrait shots and even sports shots. There is even an option that lets the camera sense when someone smiles and automatically snap the photo!I also love that  can take 1080mp video for vlog posts and family events. I do wish it had the ability to use an external mic though. I forgot to check that before purchasing and it would have been the only thing that would have possibly made me look for something else.A viewer would be great but I do just fine looking at the 3\" LCD screen and actually use it more on point and shoot cameras anyway since I get a better view of what I'm looking at.The lens cap does connect directly to the lens housing and not on the lens itself so remember to remove it before turning your camera or the lens can't extend and you will get an error on the screen. The lens extends automatically when you turn the camera on. On a plus side, this is one way of making sure you don't forget to take the cap off before shooting photos! :0)The included software makes uploading you photos to your computer very easy. It works better than most included software and has many options included for your photos.Everything included int he kit makes it well worth the price. Even though I didn't receive the batter charger pictured, the one I got is just fine.Overall I'd say this is a really great purchase. I am very happy with the camera and the quality of photos and can't wait to take it on vacation and get some travel blog posts and vlog posts created with it!", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "As advertised", "Author": "Anastacio Leal Jr", "ReviewID": "R3LFBTBBLSJ5L5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose a 5 star because I recieved exactly what I ordered and it was on time.

This camera takes the \"Micro\" HDMI cable end, not the \"Mini\" end, to plug into the camera port. You would think a camera store would realize this and put the correct cable in the bundle. I'm not the only one that had this problem as I saw in reviews from others that this occurred with them. Amazon customer service took care of this for me and I got the correct cable which is \"Mediabridge Flex Series - High Speed Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cable with Ethernet 6 feet\" on the Amazon.com site. Nobody can beat Amazon's Customer service! We love this camera! Takes great pictures and very easy to operate. Just point and shoot in auto mode and the camera makes you look professional! It does come with a lens cap and neck strap so you don't have to order those separately like I did. The description should tell you that but doesn't. Also, if you want a plug-in charger directly to the camera, there is a port for that on the camera, you will need to order separately the Kapaxen EH-67 Replacement AC Power Adapter / Charger for Nikon Coolpix L820 L810 L310 L120 L110 L105 L100 Digital Cameras. The charger that comes with this bundle is for the batteries that have to be removed from the camera to be charged. Camera is very stable in the 30X zoom mode so don't let that throw you.

My only gripes would have to be that it doesn't have a viewfinder, so one is forced to use the LCD. Second, the batteries. Someone at Nikon must have been partying like it was 1999 and forgot...that it's not 1999. Instead of an efficient rechargeable battery pack, it packs AA's. Four of them. Last, no manual focus, but that's where I dropped the D-SLR expectation and outside of what I've just stated, I'm a very happy camper! All included accessories came in great condition, excluding what appeared to be a moldy bag, but after a run through the washing machine, looks good as new.

This will be my 2nd Coolpix purchase.  I  purchasedthis right before the ice storm hit the mid west. I have Amazon Prime, but I didn'treceive my UPS delivery until 7 days later.  I tracked the package online. Every day UPS loaded it and brought it into town,but  they first made their current deliveries and later in the day played catch up forseveral hours. This method took them 7 days to make the deliveries they should havemade during  a 2 day ice storm. So 7 days later, my package, crushed and abused,was tossed onto my porch. The poor UPS guy saw me watching  him as he threw it!But I didn't care, because I knew how well Amazon packed things.  Unfortunately, Focus Camera packaged this order. They tossed the boxed cameraand the additional 11 items in a large shipping box without any packing to secureany of it, and sent it off.  No bubble wrap like Amazon uses; no wadded upnewspapers; no cat litter; no used diapers; Nothin!  So for 7 days my camera was loaded off and on the UPS truck.  It sat at thebottom of the pile and traveled over icy roads; roads that had been plowed.  Plowsthat had created huge piles of ice at various intersections, parking lots anddriveways.  When I opened that box and saw the packing job that Focus Camera had done,my thought was,  \"Send it back. Even if the camera works today, it might not work a month fromnow after  what it's been through.\"  I never even opened the camera box to see what kind of shape the camera wasin. I already knew what it had been through. The camera box itself was so beat upthat I could not read some of the print on it. The black ink (the color of the box) hadrubbed off and the box appeared white in areas. I mean this box had taken abeating. And my camera was inside of it.  A brand new camera. No way. And I amnot blaming UPS. It is not their fault  we had an ice storm. It is Focus Camera's faultfor not securing the items within the box they sent me.  So I taped it back up, and prepared to send it back.I looked at my order and realized this was not a Prime order. My mistake. I wasalways told by my friends that I could trust the little blue Prime logo next to anorder and to always use it. This did not have it.  If I order a bundle in the future and it IS Prime, I  hope I do notsee the words Focus Camera as the Seller because I won't buy it. The outer shipping box didn't come from Amazon. It came from Focus Cameraaccording to the return address label. At the bottom of the outer box there was astamp in black ink that said\"Amazon.com\\packaging  Rate this packaging\"In other words, since it did not originate with Amazon, they want feed back to letthem know the condition of the packaging when it arrived. I think everyone hereneeds to let them know. The whole order started at Focus Camera, andnever passed through the hands of anyone at Amazon.So if you are unhappy with this bundle, or Focus Camera, let Amazon know. Theydon''t like to represent themselves as shoddy, untrustworthy, unreliable, and careless.But that is the message I received from this order.I am glad that I can depend on Amazon to refund my money.maidensolo", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Item was dented when shipped", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1LCTPCXYHCR7T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for my son for Christmas, and when he opened the camera on the lens wouldn't open.
