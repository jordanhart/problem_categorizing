{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice addition to my video distribution system.", "Author": "Rich", "ReviewID": "RUHHSA2Z70LJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this on my system for about a month now with no problems. I'm using it to assign a channel to my baby cameras so I can put them on my whole-house video distribution system. Now I can watch the baby cam from any TV in the house. This thing works just as the manufacturer claims.  It's smaller than a deck of cards, lightweight, and it's easy to set the output channel.  The video quality is great--completely clear. It might not be the cheapest, but I've been using another surveillance camera/modulator combo by Net Media for 2 years with zero problems so I trust the company.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great little box", "Author": "Frank Simon", "ReviewID": "RK55F86WD2AHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this modulator to get access from a video feed into a room with only RF access. Very easy to install; the RF signal looks great.
