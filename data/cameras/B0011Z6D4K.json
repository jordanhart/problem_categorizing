{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Compared to FX-35 it pros, it has cons...", "Author": "Noel Hastings \"Emergency Medicine MD\"", "ReviewID": "R3VIO69C1O2PNH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just upgraded from the FX-35 and did quite a few tests yesterday. Overall, the FX-500 is an excellent camera but dollar for dollar you get a little more with the FX-35. That being said, I am selling my FX-35 and keeping the FX-500 (see eBay!) because some small specific differences weigh in favor of the FX-500 for me as a photographer, but not necessarily because the camera is better. There were a few primary issues I want to mention between the two cameras though.First, the FX-500 is noticeably larger than the FX-35. I know specs are specs, but just the weight and feel make it larger and it is less comfortable in a shirt pocket. The bonus is that for those of us with larger hands it is more comfortable to use without always hitting buttons with your thumb. Second, the lens is not quite as wide as the FX-35. This could be a number of factors, but since we know the chip processes not only noise but some optical distortions (try comparing the RAW and JPEG versions of a few Lumix camera images!) this could be post processing by the chip. I would guess the FX-500 is about a 25.5mm or 26mm wide angle compared to the FX-35. That, or the FX-35 is a 24.5mm :)The most disappointing aspect of the FX-500 is that the images are not quite as good as the FX-35. Look close, mainly in low light. I notice significantly more noise artifact in the FX-500 images compared to the FX-35 in all ISO's. This make sense since the FX-500 has a much larger screen sitting right behind the chip and more electronics. I am sure the FX-500 generates more electronics noise from this fact alone and that has to be processed out. Luckily, the FX-500 has many more manual controls and you can adjust contrast, sharpness and noise reduction and little. Still, making as many adjustments as I could I could not get the same quality out of the FX-500 that I could get out of the FX-35. Let me stress that this image difference is small and only available to Pixel Peepers when you zoom in 100%, but it is noticeable. So, if you shoot wide and hope you can later crop in to get the image you want you will do better with the FX-500 to frame tight to reduce the amount of cropping.Those were the largest issues I saw, but let me say the build quality is excellent as it always is with Lumix cameras. The menus are intuitive and the touch screen works wonderfully (even with a screen protector on the LCD). I think the actual number of items the touch screen is useful for is smaller than the number of things you can actually do with it, but for those things it is nice. The focus control is sweet, changing modes and scenes is quicker and easier and things like the playback control for movies now offer you real buttons on the screen which is very intuitive.When you compare the fact that the FX-500 has more manual controls, a larger LCD, fancy gadget points for the touch screen and a slightly longer lens at 125mm, I decided to stick with it. This is also because I got one on eBay for about $350. If you are not really going to play with the gadgets on this camera that much and want a pocketable point and shoot with excellent, amazing optics, pick the FX-35. If you want a little more manual control, some sweet gadget novelty with the touch screen and perhaps a slightly longer lens and don't mind spending $100 more, get the FX-500. I decided on the FX-500 but really I am just waiting for a new and improved upgrade for my FZ-18! (I want a 10M chip and fancier processor, other than that I love the FZ-18!)Two last notes: the rubberized case feel of the FX-35 is more secure in your hand in some ways and I really miss that on the FX-500. Also, the FX-500 seems to eat batteries a little faster. (makes sense though, expected...)Pros:1. longer zoom range nice2. larger, heavier body easier to hold for large hands3. intuitive touch screen, fast & easyCons:1. more chip noise than FX-35, but manageable2. larger heavier body less pocketable3. costs $100 more than FX-35 for minor upgrades4. battery life a little shorter than FX-35", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent at it strengths, good even at it's weaknesses", "Author": "O.

I searched for 6 months for a camera that met my requirements (in this order).Must Haves:-fast first picture from 'off' state-good low light pictures (as good as a compact anyway)-small enough to fit in pocket (for bars, parties, etc)-HD Video-7MP or moreNice to have:-manual photo options-Zoom while video record-.avi video recording-4x zoom or moreI was originally going to purchase the TZ5, but this model's manual options and smaller size won me over.  For my purposes, giving up the 10x optical zoom was well worth it.PROS:-excellent (amazing) \"Auto Ai\" mode:  It's truly point-and-shoot if you want it to be-image stabilization 'mode 2' works very well to reduce blur-about 1.25 second to first pic from off (about 2 sec with flash)-battery life (second only to the Casios that I've purchased for friends and family)-low-light pictures: if you set the correct scene mode, you can get a very decent picrture without flash  - better thatn any other compact digitals I've seen.-great video quality: 720p .MOV format is compatible with iMovie and looks great on a 42\" 1080P LCD TV on a computer (you'll need to pay extra for the cable that goes directly from the camera to the TV)-25mmm wide-angle is surprisingly useful, but you have to remember to zoom slightly if you don't want a slight 'fisheye' view.-there is a 'quick menu' that gives you 2-button access to all the most often used functions (they change with each mode)-one touch access to self-timer (great for quick self-portraits)CONS:-no zoom while video recording (TZ5 only as far as I know)-sometimes it's unclear whether to use touchscreen or the joystick (I think anywhere that uses the touch should also be able to use the joystick)-flash pics are about 6 seconds shot-to-shot (with 2/3 battery on full iA mode with double red-eye reduction flash)MINOR ANNOYANCES:-the LCD turns off after a some flash pictures for 1.5 sec or so (I suppose to help the flash recharge more quickly)-tripod mount is to far left of body: bad for tiny portable tripods, but placement allows you to change battery/card without disconnecting tripod-USB cable is not a (current-standard) mini-USB on the camera end.  This may be a plus later on as more phones and cameras use micro-USBSUMMARY:This is the best camera available for my requirements, and an excellent overall compact.  It has the best low-light pictures (with defeated flash) that I've seen on a digital compact (aside from the old, old Fujis).  It's the first camera that I've been truely comfortable setting on 'auto' and knowing I will almost always get a good picture.If you want a pocket-sized camera that you can just whip out at an event and be assured of a good picture or take a great looking video clip, while retaining the ability to do some limited manual exposures, this is the one for you.", "Date": "May 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "One of the best cameras I've had to return.", "Author": "M.

I've alway been a fan of the Canon line of cameras and was a bit skeptical about switching brands, but the lackluster reviews of the recent Canons made me look at other options.  The FX500 has met or exceeded all my expectations for the camera.  The pictures are exceptional, the touchscreen is a joy to use, and the battery life is above average. Our pictures have been bright and vivid with minimal user intervention, the HD video is wonderful and its compact size and durable case means we can take it anywhere.If I had any negatives to report, it's the same issues with other PnS cameras, we experienced some red eye, a bit of noise in the pictures and the audio quality wasn't all that great.********UPDATE*******After having the camera for almost a month it pains me to say it, but its being sent back.  I mentioned noise in my review and after looking at all the pictures we've taking in great detail the pictures are just not crisps and clear.  My wife is the main user of the camera and she constantly take pictures, runs them through photo shop and then prints them.  When she sat down to do the first set from our vacation she found when zooming the pictures really become grainy and are blurry when printed.  They look fine without the zoom, but when you start to zoom in you loose detail that our older camera captures.Its really disappointing, the camera has the best interfaces I've seen and the touch screen is very nice.

I badly wanted a pocketable camera with 5x optical zoom, manual controls, a wide angle lens, and above all, great image quality.  I have been so happy with Panasonic compacts that I decided to wait 2 months for the DMC-FX500, but I feel like that was a complete waste of time.  With all its bells and whistles, and the promise of full manual settings, this camera just doesn't take good photos.For the steep $350, I expected the camera to at least somewhat approach the image quality of my Canon G7, which has near-DSLR IQ.  This camera sadly doesn't even hold a candle to my wife's DMC-FX03, an older, low/middle-range Panasonic.  Photos are generally very soft, and lacking focus.  Highlights are often blown out, and lack vibrant colors.  About 1 in 4 photos actually comes out decent, with somewhat acceptable focus.  The 9-point auto focus setting turned in the best results, but even those were spotty.I spent much of a 3-day weekend trying to tweak the manual settings, white balance, megapixel levels, sharpness and noise reduction controls, and came up with about the quality I'd expect from a $100 camera.  Neither close-ups nor wide shots lacked sufficient detail.  The \"intelligent\" auto setting is odd b/c there seems to be nothing intelligent about it - the results are almost random - some are way under-exposed and others are badly blown out.  Some shots are relatively well-focused, while others are soft/blurry.  Almost none approach a \"great\" shot.I keep wondering if I've gotten a bum unit, but I'm so disappointed with this camera that I don't feel like bothering.  Even with the Canon SD870IS' questionable reliability (our friends had trouble with theirs), I'd rather drop down to 4x zoom and 8 megapixels, which will be better anyway due to not having to stuff too many MP into a small image sensor.  I don't have any doubt it will take the quality of photos I expect from a higher-end compact, and for about $90 less than this one.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Terrific Camera - Image Stabilization Works Well", "Author": "J.

The photos are excellent in quality, better than my last Canon (the SD1000, total junk camera) by FAR.  Lightweight and the video recording in HD at 720P feature is AWESOME for shooting small clips that look excellent on my 42\" plasma.  Flash is bring enough for all situations, and in natural light shooting with no flash the Optical Image Stabilization helps a lot.  Some graininess noted in photos above ISO 400 and in a basement with no windows and lighting dimmed WAY down, but that's to be expected from ALL cameras.  Quick fiddling with the manual mode (done by touchscreen) and you can take 10MP photos in very low light with no flash and they look quite good... very impressed.

Sad to say the camera construction & layout itself, the interface is wonderful but the quality of pictures (its \"reason for being\" in the first place, right?)is borderline horrible (in comparison say to the Canon SD850IS which is an almost perfect comparison in size & specs...to the FX500 side-by-sde, picture-for-picture using the exact same settings, light and subject...).

I was very skeptical to start with as I had no exposure to panasonic cameras, but I am pleased I made a move. I was tired by looking at over saturated colors of Sony (can someone show them the real \"red\"?) while I had no complaints for canon products, when I compared same images of canon vs panasonic at major review sites, I liked FX35/FX500 or TZ5 much better - in terms of color and clarity. Also there are a no. of useful features (you can find more details in other reviews) that are not available in canon cameras in the same prize range. Finally I decided to go for FX500. We just returned from Disney vacation over independence day weekend and I have some great images in addition to few cool HD videos !!!True - the noise levels in low light condition is visible but this one beats all other in day light by miles, and for 2 yr old son who goes to bed at 9 pm this is perfect.BTW - I decided to go for FX500 and not FX35 because of 2 reasons -looks (the black model is awesome) and combination of touchscreen and joy stick and not a 4 - way dial (that looks really old).

Riedel", "ReviewID": "R2RV7F8A7UO4JG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera due to its compact size, its wide angle lens, its long maximum exposure (60 seconds, I'm an astronomer and amateur astrophotographer), its manual controls, targeted tracking autofocus, and 'intelligent ISO mode'.I nearly returned this camera because the images seemed to have blurry edges and like they were covered in dirt.  Eventually I realized the pictures were NOT blurry (see #2 below), and if I was careful with my exposure and noise reduction settings I could make the noise look like film grain.Combined with a mini travel tripod, I've managed to get some pretty nice night scenery (60 seconds, \"full\" manual controls) and nice portraits.  That 25mm is great for scenery.  (Incidentally, the \"Scenery\" scene mode fixes the focus at infinity, which is great for taking pictures of the Moon. Unfortunately, you can't control shutter speed or aperture, but see #7)If the noise still bothers you, resizing the pictures to 7 megapixels or less (which can be done in-camera) should basically remove the problem.Some random notes:1.) The on-screen review can apparently zoom in farther (16x) than 100%; your photos are sharper than they appear on screen.2.) I've seen some noticeable distortion at the corners of images taken at the full wide-angle.3.) Contrary to the manual, switching to 7 and 5 and 3 megapixel modes is NOT just cropping out the center; they're merely scaled down versions of the full frame just like you'd expect.  On the other hand, digital zoom WILL crop out the center.4.) The Intelligent ISO mode actually works.  It seems to be like tweaking the gamma in an image editor.5.) Targeted autofocus does NOT work well.  More often than not it can't seem to lock on the object I touched.  On the other hand, once locked it tracks the object well.6.) The Mega OIS image stabilization works wonders, but in low light it's usually not enough to make up for the longer exposures you'll need to see anything.7.) You can set the desired exposure compensation for the 'Scenery' mode (and possibly others) by going to Aperture or Shutter mode, setting the exposure compensation, and switching back.8.) The USB connector is microUSB, not miniUSB.9.) It works with Linux out of the box!  When you plug it in to a computer, it will ask you to select (via the joystick thingy) between MTP and PC connection, which seems to be a standard USB Mass Storage mode.10.)

I was used to a 2.0 inch screen- Clarity and sharpness of photos are FANTASTIC when at 25mm. Otherwise not so much (I'll describe later in the CONS)- small compact size.- Eh??? touch screen is alright. Not all menus etc are accessable via touch. You also have to access certain menus/functions via the joystickCons:- NOISE NOISE NOISE!  UGH!!!!!!  Using the IA shooting mode isn't as beneficial as one would think. Especially for indoor shots.  It automatically puts the ISO at 400 ... and UGH!!!!  at 400 the noise is awfully noticable.  south of like ISO 300 is much better, but you really really have to play around with the camera to get at a lower ISO for indoor shot without flash.  I've been pulling my hair out trying to find the best method to accomplish this, and for the moment, I think I did find the correct method.  Use SHUTTER PRIORITY MODE, and play around with the horizontal and vertical bars and turning the flash off.  Depending on the lighting in the room, for the mostpart, you can achieve non-noisy shots at lower isos.  GOOD LUCK-Movie quality.  even in the 1280 x 720p 30fps mode, sound quality SUCKS and the visual quality is still quite pixelly.  I'm not impressed with the video quality at all.-OH, the zoom (talking about optical zoom ... NOT digital zoom).  At 25mm photo quality is perfect.  Even if you zoom in a little bit, I've found that photo quality is poor.  Blurry (even is beautiful sunny weather outside).  I've tried focusing and focusing, and refocusing on the same object in a higher zoom and each time, the image is blurry (non-super crisp).  I've even tried putting the camera on a tripod. Same result.  So, I for the most part do not zoom.  Which is annoying.-Time between taking shots seems slower than I would like.  I've set the Autoreview off and it's still slower than I would like.All in all, as others have said, this is a camera that I want to love soooooo much but I just cannot.

Rabun\"", "ReviewID": "RMYCQF0YVG5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was tired of my Olympus XA rangefinder film camera getting stuck so that the film would not advance and the shutter would not fire. I have used it for a long while and really enjoyed a \"small shooter\" I could pop out at any time and snap a quick candid. This camera is not as unobtrusive as the XA because it has no viewfinder (only the screen) meaning I have to stand there with my arms out staring at the screen and looking a lot more conspicuous. I also lost the three-point stabilization of two hands + face that helped hold the camera steady.Having said all that, I am very glad I bought this. The photo quality is nice ISO 200 or lower and reasonable up to 400. Compared to a film camera not so good but to other digitals in the same genre I find that it excels. The menu system is so intuitive as to make the manual unneeded for standard shooting (read it anyway -- there are a lot of amazing features available).The Leica-branded optics are excellent... I have seen very little flair, almost no falloff or vignetting, and no CA (at low ISO). The camera gets noisy quick at 400 and images shot at 800 or higher are not usable unless you just want something to prove you took a picture. This was never my requirement and my intent is to use this camera until a decent, pocket-able DSLR becomes available and affordable (Micro Four Thirds, I would guess, but even the current generation is not quite ready for prime time) or until I am willing to spring for a Leica D-Lux or something comparable.In the meantime, I find this camera a ready and able street-shooter. The biggest pluses I can mention are:--Rapid shutter. You push, it shoots. Push again, it shoots again. The shutter release is VERY responsive, one of the biggest problems with most compact digitals.--Flash is a fill flash. No harsh shadows.--Image Stabilization. Compensates for the hand shake with a compact.--Small, light, and unobtrusive. Fits nicely in a shirt pocket or a cell-style belt pouch.--Extremely well designed and intuitive menu system--Full manual control over exposure and aperture with an excellent TTL meter. This is rarely available on a compact and makes the term \"point and shoot\" invalid when applied to this camera, though it can be used that way.--Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority modes, as well as Program AE.--Extremely accurate auto-focus--Auto-focus is FAST--Depth of field is displayed right on the screen (e.g. 1.5f to 35ft)--Auto-focus is easily adjusted shot-by-shot if desired...just touch the AF point on the screen--Extra wide-angle lens perfect for landscapes and large groups.--Optical zoom with the ability to completely disable so-called \"digital zoom\". In fact, it was disabled by default on my unit.--Battery life is so long as to obviate the need for a spare (but I still have one). I shoot for 10 days or so without recharging and the battery has never been dead yet. Caveat: I almost never use a flash.--JPEG engine seems to produce high quality files that are not overly large despite the high megapixel countCons:--It is a compact digital, no viewfinder--So-so image quality at ISO 400, noisy at 800 and useless at 1600. These are not a concern for me. The image stabilization has allowed me to shoot at the lower ISO speeds with a slower shutter speed and not see any motion blur (or only background subject motion, not camera shake).Overall, I find this to be an outstanding camera compared with ANY compact digital. I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Make sure you lower your ISO when you done with ISO 1600", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Pcal07\"", "ReviewID": "RBIO3LW4GI2BH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had the camera for over a year, and it's been awesome.Took the camera to aquarium last week, set the ISO to 1600.

What finally decided it for me was that at the time on Amazon this camera was about $60 less than the TZ5, and every review I had read said the two cameras were pretty much the same except:-The TZ5 has a 10x optical zoom; the FX500 only has 5x.-The TZ5 has all automatic/preset controls; the FX500 has manual options.-The TZ5 can zoom during video recording; the FX500 cannot.-Also the FX500 is about 2/3 the depth of the TZ5 (the extra room is needed for the bigger lense).For me it just wasn't worth the extra money for 10x zoom and video zoom, plus I wanted a high-quality camera I could carry in my pocket, and the TZ5 is supposed to be a little too bulky for that.So far I've taken some shots indoors, as well as overcast outdoors and at the sunny beach, and I'll admit I've definitely gotten some bad pictures.  But in my experience with the camera, a bad pic means I'm doing something wrong, and there's always a way to adjust to get a crisp, beautiful photo.  If you're 100% a point-and-click kind of person, this may not be the best choice because the auto-mode doesn't always choose the absolute best settings, and you have to tinker around with it some to get optimal results.  I personally like that aspect, however.  I bought this camera for less than $200, and it was definitely a great deal.Oh, a couple things about the zoom:-You can't zoom DURING video recording, but you can zoom beforehand; so for example, if you want to record something far away, just zoom in before you hit the record button and voila!  It is a little annoying that you have to choose the zoom level in advance, but I was happily surprised when I figured out I could zoom at all in video mode.-Saying the camera has any more than 5x zoom is misleading.  Besides optical zoom there are a couple other kinds (digital and one other, forget the name) that supposedly let you zoom in even more, but all these really do are crop the picture or decrease the quality; After 5x optical zoom, the more you zoom in, the lower the resolution or smaller the pic.  Since I always take pictures at max resolution, I don't see the point in ever using the other zoom modes; if I want a picture to be narrowly focussed on a distant object, I'll just crop it after the fact.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good photos, but try it out in person first if you can", "Author": "HDfridge", "ReviewID": "R36PMV5A5JIASU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera takes great photos, but I'd recommend trying it out in person first.  The wide angle lens is amazing, and the photos are solid.  HD video looks good, but in low light it gets a little grainy.  The audio is probably the weakest part of the video experience- look to the ZS3 for superior audio... at twice the price.I will probably end up sending it back because it just doesn't work for me ergonomically.  The silver bar on the side is an attempt to give you something to grab on to, but it just gets in the way.  Also, the thin slice of control surface on the back that isn't covered by the screen is too little for my thumb to grab onto.  The touch screen works well, but it's really just a gimmick that results in lots of fingerprints on the screen.  Finally, the edges of the camera are really squared off - it's pocketable, but barely.The FX-35 or FX-37 will probably fix all these deficiencies for me, and since they both use the same sensor and pretty close to the same lenses, they might just fit the bill.  This camera takes amazing photos for the price it's selling for right now.

The wide angle, touch screen, zoom and higher resolution video really lured me to this camera.  However, the photo image quality was poor compared to my older Sony DSC-N1 or the replacement Canon I bought.  (Sony N1 video is poor & jerky)I think some reviewer are impressed with their first touch screen - as they are impressive - but I am used to them since my Sony DSC-N1 has a  touch screen.I have a critical eye for image quality, and the colors from the Lumix FX500 had a blah quality and yellow tint.  I tried to compensate by setting the white balance to Warm - it helped a lot - but it still could not compete with the Sony or Canon.  Also, the FX500 focus was often soft and not sharp.  When in focus, FX500 resolution was equal to my Sony N1 that has 8 MegaPixels.  In general the Sony Color looked better in the side-by-side shoot-out comparison. (even when tweaking the FX500 settings, and leaving the Sony on Auto).  Though Sony saturates colors a bit, the overall photos just looked better.  The Color was not true in DMC-FX500 photos - and the photos had a yellow tint (yuck!).  I bought a Canon SD870-IS, and returned this Lumix DMC-FX500 camera.  Wow, the Canon SD870 photos have great true colors and are sharp (Much better color that Lumix and truer color than Sony).  The Canon video is standard 640x480 resolution - but very good quality. Living without a touch screen is fine.  I am technical and did not have issues with the Canon interface.  I was hesitant to buy a Canon - as I had reliability issues and experienced poor customer service 9 years ago with a high end digital Canon camcorder (broke just out of warranty with little use). A friend also had a Canon digital camera break easily and Canon repair is expensive.  But the images from the Canon SD870 camera are fantastic and the video is good (much better video than the Sony N1). You can Zoom while shooting video with the Canon - but focus gets blurry with video zoom above 3.8x.  The Canon SD870 has been working like a champ for the past 3 weeks with heavy daily use.

BUT, the thing it is missing is good picture quality. The noise in the pictures is horrible. Most of them come out with an orange tint and some of them even had spots show up. Even with trying to adjust the white balance, it still was on the dark side. It seems like the indoor photos were worse than the outdoor ones but I found some blurring outside when I tried to zoom in some. You have to constantly, if not for every shot, try changing the settings and or scenes to get a good picture. The camera itself is a very comfortable and easy to maneuver and has some nice features, except that what good is it if you don't get decent photos. I had this camera for a week and I gave it a good chance but after I had my pictures printed, it was then that I decided that this camera had to go back to the store before I ended up with an expensive paperweight. I also  don't think the battery life was anything special either.Bottom line:  I am sticking with my old 35mm film camera.

If this is the business model Panasonic wants to practice (so as not to compete with their camcorder dept.) that's fine with me, but they should explicitly state so, otherwise their \"5 x zoom\" marketing is misleading and deceptive. A month ago I bought Canon SD870IS and was happy with it, except for its 3x zoom (too small for lots of professional dance shots that I make). Then I read the announcement for the upcoming FX500s. They sold me on the 5x zoom and HD movie resolution (that Canon lacks). I was in a 14 day return period so I decided to part with Canon and wait a month for this one. Today I gladly received Lumix DMC-FX-500S, but was dismayed and upset that having decided to sell it as the most advanced pocket size cam on the market (e.g. manual exposure that e.g. Canon lacks) Panasonic has decided to drop zoom mode while filming (you set the zoom prior to the recording but not during it, which is outright dumm). I hope there will be more returns like mine (sorry Amazon) so they can learn their lesson the hard way and be forced to rethink their modus operandi and perhaps upgrade the firmware. I am sorry, but as it is now, lack of the zoom in video recording mode is a deal breaker for me.
