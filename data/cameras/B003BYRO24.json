It seems very reliable; I've had it running for several months and it has never crashed.  The web based application for computers is simple to use, provides very good functionality and picture quality (with a broadband connection).On the down side, I couldn't get the phone-based remote viewer to work on my smartphone. Defender/SVAT should look for better remote phone viewing software than the one they recommended in the manual. Including a driver in the program that allows a wireless mouse to work on the DVR would be quite useful.Also, all the informational material that I read prior to buying the DVR suggested that email notifications can be set up when motion is detected - this notification feature just doesn't work. It might matter to you, but it wasn't that big of a deal for us.All this said, I'd recommend this DVR.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$349.99", "Features": "Access live video footage directly from your iPhone or BlackBerry Smart Phone\nH.264 video compression lets you record over a month of footage\nLet the coaching iMenu teach you about the DVR's settings and features\nMultiple viewing options allow you to connect up to two televisions and a VGA monitor\n24/7 lifetime live customer support is available through phone, and live web chat", "Name": "Defender SN502-4CH-X 4 Channel Smart Phone Compatible H.264 DVR Security System with Coaching iMenu (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31pd1dRx6qL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003BYRO24"}}
