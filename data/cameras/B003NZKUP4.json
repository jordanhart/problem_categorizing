It is nice and compact, so I can take it anywhere.  The touch screen is very useful and allows me to change the settings I want to take great pictures or even shoot a video if I want.  I'm not a professional photographer, but I think my pictures come out looking as if I was.  Its great that it uses AA batteries cause I can always just replace them on the go without having to find a wall outlet and then wait for a battery to charge.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Had to many problems with the one I bought", "Author": "Armsmere", "ReviewID": "R153K44J91USGD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this camera when I bought it.  I liked the low price and the reviews I read were pretty good.  Only thing I worried about was that people said the on/off switch was likely to turn on by accident, eating up batteries.  I figured I could deal with that by having a hard case and being careful.  When I got it, I found out that, at least on the one I had, the on/off switch was hard to get to turn on when you wanted it on and would turn on \"by itself\" when you didn't want it on.  I called it finicky.  I spent a lot of time trying to turn the thing on instead of capturing the shot I was after. Once I took pictures and loaded them on my laptop, the slideshows were marred by vertical grainy lines lines running through each shot.  I never tried printing a picture so I don't know if the lines showed up in print.  I sent the camera back and ordered a different one.  I bought  an 8.0 megapixel camera (fewer megapixels) and am very happy with it.  I think too many megapixels caused the problem with the grainy lines.  Who needs 12 or 16 megapixels anyway?", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "CW450T camera I GREAT", "Author": "Shelest Jones", "ReviewID": "R1TXUKPYW2TS32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Have the CW450t HP camera in color merlot, I LOVE THIS CAMERA and I record Video for as long as I want as long as I have a Big GB memory card the sound is crisp and loud and the video is clear so is the pics the touch screen is great and I have so many options of scenes, back grounds,.....ect and you can write, draw, and use art stamps on the pics there is a lot to choose from the only problem I have is that the shutter speed is a little slow and the zoom is just ok but its worth its money I just wish I had it in Ocean Blue but if your looking for an every day camera for that every moment this is the camera you want I took 1900 pics with this came already and only had it for a year", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP Products", "Author": "Kathy", "ReviewID": "RMP9EPAE9TH2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love HP products, quick and easy and economically apt.thanks for a wonderful experience of online shopping, with all that goes on electronically, this was smooth.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "love the beach", "ReviewID": "R15HER1TN9RX9K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in blue about a year and a half ago, and was very disappointed in it, for two reasons: The screen totally washed out in sunlight,so all my outdoor shots were just guessed at. The other problem is battery life - maybe I just got a bad one, but no matter what kind of batteries I tried, they didn't last. The camera seemed to drain the battery while it wasn't being used, so when I tried to take a picture, it just froze. I have since purchased a different brand of camera which has neither of these problems, and am extremely happy with it.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera at a low price", "Author": "Humberto Bosc\u00e1n", "ReviewID": "R2NDT48SQFNR3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is incredible what this camera can do.
