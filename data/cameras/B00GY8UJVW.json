{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible staff in my photo tool kit", "Author": "Roman Matejcik", "ReviewID": "R1Y306OAGJ75MV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The purchase of this camera kit was perfectly timed before my holidays on Island of Reunion. The camera fitted with the 18-140mm lenses fits to 95% of the situations you can expect on your holidays. I was slightly missing my other 55-200mm Nikon lens used on D5000 when details/macro were wished.The picture quality, however, is incomparable to the results got from my previous camera Nikon D5000. The sharpness, depth and colors are more vivid. I was really positively surprised from the results even though this was the main reason for buying this camera.The delivered Deluxe Accessory Kit provided me with plenty of useful stuff as filters, maintenance kit, tripod, bag, massive memory card and lot of other things, for price seriously lower comparing to the sum of prices for the individual items.Before buying this camera I was deciding between this DX and full-frame D600. At the end, the issue of compatibility of my previously obtained lenses, significantly affected my decision. Currently I am glad I was taking this issue into account as I do not need to spend another  thousands of EUR for lenses I already have and on other hand the picture quality is seriously comparative to the full-frame (according to the reviews I checked before decision taken).This kit is a great offer for someone who is looking to replace previous Nikon camera of a lower range as D3xxx or D5000. The only feature I have not tried yet is the build in wi-fi, but my most critical publicum (my family) was with me, so I had no need to share the pictures taken from distance.Recommendation: do not touch the setting for the mirror. I did (unconsciously) and had significant delay in the release of the shutter, as it was waiting for stabilizing the mirror before shooting. You cannot imagine how much shots I missed due to the delay of shutter, so be more clever than me and do not miss your perfect snap!", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GY8UJVW"}}
