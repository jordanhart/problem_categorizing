{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Transformed a skeptic!", "Author": "Rishikesh Bhalerao", "ReviewID": "R1R0Q35C3UY8MX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a dedicated film camera user for several years and a skeptic of digital photography. Until now.I chose the Canon S50 after about two months of research into contemporary cameras. I relied upon a digital photography portal called \"Digital Photography Review\" to compare different models, and then used Amazon to compare prices. If you are making the move to digital, it is wise to factor in the price of image editing software (I use --and highly recommend--Adobe Photoshop Elements), an upgraded memory card, and an additional battery. The S50 does not come with a case, so add that to the list as well.There has been some fair criticism leveled at digital camera manufacturers for their emphasis on mega pixels. I cannot argue with this; however, having 5-mega pixels over 4 (at a slight price premium) does give you the flexibility to later crop images to your liking, yet, retain good resolution. One of the common complaints against the S50 (over the slightly less expensive 4-mega pixel S45) is the issue of purple fringing at wide angles. My own experience has been that, even at the widest angle, color distortions are virtually non-existent in this camera. The image quality is excellent and skin tones are very good even when using a flash. The flash is a tiny band at the top right (when you face the lens) but, despite its small size, it is very effective for indoor pictures. The camera is quite small for all it can do. The number of manual controls is astounding; I have a feeling this camera offers much more creative freedom than my previous one, a film SLR from the mid-eighties, which came with three detachable lenses, a separate flash unit, and a large carrying case that, when filled with all equipment, weighed about 8 pounds!Digital cameras generally have one drawback--shutter delay, and this is one area that the S50 does not perform well. I have seen shutter delay to vary between almost no delay to little more than a full second. Of course, I have not used other digital cameras, so I cannot tell how this compares. Another weakness is the flimsy lens cover: you have to be careful when closing the cover. I also managed to scratch the LCD screen within a few days of receiving the camera, although this does not affect the images in any way. A protective case would have helped (why doesn't Canon include one!). The included compact flash memory card has a capacity of only 32MB. I would recommend buying a much larger card (such as a 512MB card) that can store a very large number of images (several thousand at lower resolutions). With a large card, the battery inevitably runs out out before the card is full. Buy a spare!Overall, I enthusiastically recommend the S50, especially if you are making the move away from film cameras. The S50 has irreversibly drawn me away from film cameras, even though I did not think that was possible just a year ago. Perhaps it will also transform your perspective.", "Date": "October 18, 2003"}, {"Title": "Best value for the money", "Author": "scott \"scott\"", "ReviewID": "R2JE6SIV1DFNOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third digital camera, my previous was a 3.2MP Casio QV3000EX. While Casio is not a well known name in the US for cameras, it's still hard to find a digital camera today that matches the QV3000EX feature/price point. The S50 does this and more!The Good:1. Made in Japan (not China as some other Japanese cameras ie Minolta).2. Metal case, and it feels like it is well made (heavy). Buttons give a solid feel.3. Turns on quick - 4 seconds.4. Small size. This will easily fit into your shirt pocket. The S50 has the features of a G3 and the compactness of the S400. The best of both worlds. No other 5MP camera comes close to this size, with the exception of the Minolta F300.5. Extreme manual control: 10 aperature settings (most digital camaras have 2), 45 shutter settings! You will not find a camera with more control at this price.6. Lens can zoom in macro mode. Others such as Minolta S414 cannot.7. Fast Canon lens - great pictures in low light and little to no blooming (purple fringe). In my opinion, Canon makes the best digital camera lens. The Casio QV3000EX has a Canon lens, and it takes great pictures. The lens makes or breaks a camera, don't compromise here.8. Will NOT turn on when in your pocket. It's just plain annoying that manufacturers continue to make knobs that turn at the slightest touch. The dial on the S50 gives a solid and metal sounding click.9. Battery charger is small an unobtrusive. Fits into the smallest of camera bags.The Bad:1. You pay a price for Canon. But you get what you pay for. You can get a cheaper digital camera, but you will not get one that has perhaps the best lens, great auto focus, and exreme manual control, and - in the end great pictures. Take a look at the sample pictures at Canon's site. Compare them to similar cameras. You will wonder why you thought of buying another brand. Also consider the S400 for a more limited point and shoot, or the G3 for professional/traditional SLR look and feel.2. Uses a proprietary battery. To be honest, I'd rather use AA Ni-MH batteries. But with the Canon system, you probably get bettery power management since they can monitor the battery state better than if it is generic rechargables. In the end it's probably a wash.

I already have a Sony F707, and was looking for a camera to take around that still had the 5 mp output, but a smaller form factor. When it came down to it, it was either this camera or the Olympus C50Z and I'm glad I decided on the S50. You just can't beat the Canon for features and design. Plus, the C50Z supposidly doesn't have a mic for video.PROS:From what the reviews have said, this is just a scaled down version of the Canon G3, but with 5 mp output vs. 4 with the G3.It's got a very solid construction and I love the brushed metallic look of the body. It's not quite pocket sized - I tried lugging it around in my pocket for a day...a little bulky for that, but i'd say it's a great compromise for those that want more features than what the digital Elph series offers.Speaking of which, it's got a great bundle of features. Images are bright and very real to life. From what I can tell, it's very similar in general shooting modes as my Sony. I leave the camera glued to Program AE, as I seem to get the best quality and still have the ability to adjust the different modes on the camera.  The continuous shooting mode is excellent and the intervalometer (time lapse photo shooting) is definitely a nice new feature. Further the stich assist and video modes with sound make it a better buy over the C50Z.Also, the camera is very fast - from taking it out of the bag to turning it on, it's a little less than 4 seconds and it's ready to shoot.Further, the camera uses non-memory lithium ion - I have yet to drain the battery fully from a days worth of shooting.  I almost never turn off the view finder and the battery's held up like a champ.  It also uses standard compact flash, which I picked up at Amazon (256mb Viking) [at a good price]after rebates. Just can't beat that...COULD IMPROVE ON:The only thing with the construction that got me a little concered was the slide door for the lens. If you moved it a certain way, it can move up and down. Still, the overall construction is very solid.The macro is pretty average. It says in the guide that you can get as close as 5 cm or thereabouts, but the closest I could get in focus was about 3 inches. I guess it's the size of the optics.Also, why only the black? I really like the brushed stainless look of the S45, but you can't get that flavor with the S50. From what I've heard, it's only available in Europe. I guess it's a marketing thing, but still... Don't get me wrong, I like the black, but it'd be nice to have the choice and black tends to show dust quite easily.And while I like that it uses standard compact flash, I've noticed it's a little slower in tranfers and reading than Sony Memory stick.Anyway, these are negligible issues and overall, Canon has really outdone themselves again.", "Date": "April 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "A Winner in Image Quality Versus Size", "Author": "Roy Chan", "ReviewID": "R8CLURC0WGUTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Compact size, 5 megapixel resolution, ease of use, lots of creative photography options, Solid all metal compact body, Quality Canon lens, quality, enlargeable images, sturdy, macro capability.Cons: No provision for add-on lenses or filters, Expensive, 5MP is probably overkill for most users, Underwater housing does not allow full control, not as sharp as most 4 MP cameras, 4-way Navigation Button & Proprietary Battery, Some photos had red eye, doesn't come with carrying case.Summary: This compact Canon digital camera really impressed me in the week I've had mine so far. I've been looking and playing with the Sony DSC-P9 for some time but took a chance with the S50 sight unseen, with a few recommendations, and my expectations have been well exceded. Excellent image quality and easy to learn interface with ample effect, memory, and capture options are not compromised by the camera's size (slightly chunkier than the Sony, but still slips into a pocket easily). Crisp and bright image replay on the rear color LCD monitor. Easy downloads to PC with USB and unimposing Canon software, and fairly quick battery recharge too. This is a really great compact digital camera for those looking for great images in different conditions without a bulky, intrusive large body reflex. The movie capture is better than on previous Canon models, though still slightly choppy at 12 frames per second (not that making movies is your first choice in features for selecting pocket cameras). Nonetheless, after looking around I believe this is the best deal for quality/function/money versus size in the compact digital camera market.A+", "Date": "May 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Biggest bang for your buck", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R9FMRT813ZSUI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is the skinny; I would classify myself as an intermediate/pro photographer as an owner of 3 digital cameras and 5 SLRs. I have come to the conclusion after about 9 months with the S50 that it will give you the greatest bang for your buck. Whether you need it for its manual (semi-pro) functions or as just a point and shoot, this is just the camera. It is small and portable, yet very powerful and filled with functions that the average user will never need. It is very durable and has excellent optics, as you will eventually see from your first set of prints. This camera has been out for a while now and you will be able to purchase it at a very reasonable price. You simply cannot buy a comparable camera that even comes close.Read on for more detail.The LCD screen is very bright and easy to see, even in direct sunlight. In my experience with other digital cameras, I would recommend that you apply a screen protector. I have had them replaced on my other cameras due to scratches. They do not make them for cameras, however you can cut one out of any after market PDA screen protector. It does an excellent job protecting your screen from scratches and fingerprints. A must have when you start taking this camera wherever you go; and you will after you fall in love with it as most S50 users have.This camera takes great photo-quality pictures. The reason that I got this camera is because of the 5MP resolution. You will not need that resolution for your average 4x6 or 5x7 print; however it's nice to be able to take a picture at the highest resolution and know that you have flexibility in editing and cropping or even getting a photo-quality 8x10 or 11x14 if you ever need it. Besides, we all have 100+ Gb drives with CD burners, so whenever you want you could burn your photos on a CD/DVD for storage. However, this high resolution comes with a price. It is a necessity that you purchase a high capacity CF card. This all depends on how many photos you take per session. A 512MB card will take a little over 200 photos and ranges from $70-$100.There are those who think that you need a camera with a 4X optical zoom as opposed to the S50s 3X. The 3X vs. 4X zoom is just another selling point. DO NOT PASS THIS CAMERA UP BECAUSE OF THIS! In my professional opinion, that makes little difference to the final product, the print. Keep in mind that the more zoom you use, the more light and stability you need in holding the camera. In other words, you will likely need a tripod to take a decent picture, not to mention better lighting. Bottom line is that the 3X is ample for a camera in this class.My last recommendation is for an after market high-capacity battery. I purchased an 800mAh Lithium-ion for about $35 and it is a vast improvement over the factory supplied one. I used to lug them both with me, but I stopped doing that since I have never had the other one discharge on me before the day is over.One feature that this camera needs is hour/minute indicator of how much battery time is left. The only indicator is a two-minute warning that the battery is almost empty. So if Canon is listening, please put this in the next firmware update. My other gripe with this camera is the lens cover/door. It is flimsy and does not always close as smoothly as it is supposed to.", "Date": "January 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "Beware the sliding door of doom", "Author": "Maddi Hausmann Sojourner \"madhaus\"", "ReviewID": "R27QSCCTSOFIWQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon PowerShot S50 is a terrific small digital camera.  It packs in an amazing array of features, starting with the generous maximum 5 megapixel image size (you can make them smaller to conserve space on the CompactFlash card).  Several modes are available to you such as Sports (high shutter-speed and high resolution shots), Portrait, Night, etc.  You can put it in complete Idiot Mode (okay, Automatic mode) and let it select your shutter speed and aperture, or you can pick one or the other and let the camera pick the missing one, or you can go full into Manual mode and pick both.  There's even a Movie mode, complete with sound!This small camera fits in a purse easily (okay, not a small purse), and doesn't get in the way if you're shouldering it in a case (not included).  That means the optical zoom is limited to 3x.  And unfortuately, the S50, like all the PowerShot S family, starts out at 11mm, which is a very wide-angle value.  Even at 3X you will only come in to 55mm, often not as close as you'd expect. There is a digital zoom, but so what?  Crop your picture in software later rather than play with that silly feature.  But getting back to the range, I found it insufficient for shootingacross a large (but crowded) room.  If you work closer in this won't be a problem.I agree the sliding door that covers the lens (and turns on the camera) seems flimsy.  That's because it can cause problems.  My 3YO niece got ahold of mine and ripped the door off.  I was able to reattach it but now it's like a loose tooth, just waiting to fall off again.  Even under warranty, my choice was to send it back to Canon for 12 weeks or live with it.  I couldn't live without the camera, so I kept it, loose sliding door and all.  I've just learned not to lend it to people who can't baby it; a good push and that door is off the camera again.Then I bought a Canon Digital Rebel, which is an even better camera, but not the same type as the S50 at all.  The latter can fit into a generous shirt pocket; the Digital Rebel is a big ol' digital SLR (single-lens reflex camera, a through-the-lens viewfinder, typically with interchangeable lenses).One of the S50's limitations is a slow shutter response.  I can't tell you how many shots I've missed using it; I frame it lovingly, I see the perfect moment, I shoot... but no score.  The people have moved on, the sun has set, the universe suffers heat-death, and finally the shutter clicks.  If you want a fast shutter then you must have a digital SLR, as almost all the compact-style digital cameras such as this one have the delayed shutter issue.  Another note of annoyance on the PowerShot S family: they come with a wrist strap but no shoulder strap.  I don't know what use a wrist strip is for a camera; if I'm not using it then I want my hands free.  I bought a generic shoulder strap but it wasn't a great fit.  At least Canon should offer one as an extra-cost accessory.I still give this camera 4 stars for putting so many features in such a small package.  The pictures are reasonably good, and at this size you can crop plenty out and still print good 4x6 inch images.  The PowerShot S50 comes with software, but you'll probably want to buy your own image editing package.  The one provided is fairly limited.  Useful software includes PhotoStitch, which allows you to make your own panaramic style images from a series of linked shots.  The included CompactFlash card is also too small for typical use, so plan on buying a bigger card.", "Date": "December 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent Speed vs Feature (Form Factor) Tradeoff", "Author": "wcc2", "ReviewID": "R31BHNM15JM00G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my fourth digital camera. After owning two intro models (Olympus D490 and D460) I went in the pursuit of speed. Speed being defined on four dimensions: (1) bootup/startup time, (2) delay between depressing shutter button and digital capture, (3) lag between consecutive shots, (4) lens apeture (for low light conditions). Before the Powershot S50 I was (and still am) using an Olympus C3040, which is the main comparitor for this review. In this price range last year the C3040 was one of the fastest cameras out there due to a 32Mb RAM buffer built into the camera and its F1.8 lens. My sense is that the Powershot S50 and all of its competitors have excellent features - many modes, manual overrides, etc. For the most part, just reading the specs is enough for getting a sense of these features. What is purely experiential - what requires owning and experiencing - is how fast the camera is (on the above four dimensions). The S50 is pretty fast. Bootup about 3 seconds. Delay between pressing shutter button and capture about 1 second. Lag between consecutive shoots about 1 second (I took consecutive shoots using the same fixed composition, flash off, new batteries, repeatedly pressing shutter button very quickly). These speeds are all slightly slower than the C3040. Boot is almost the same, shutter delay almost identical, and S50 was a touch slower between consecutive shoots (after the 6th or 7th shot the S50 was lagging behind). Apeture the Canon has a slower lens (F2.8 vs F1.8). Overall the S50 is a fast camera.Obviously in the S50's favor is form factor (which is one reason why the lens is smaller, leading to a less fast lens (higher F-stop).

Check out the positives and negatives with the PowerShot S50.Positives: (where do I begin?)* Made of solid, sturdy metal. Feels like a real camera not a cheap plastic toy like other digital cameras.* Has features galore!!! Has standard features plus some pretty nice extras such as:-customizable flash-can change the strength of the flash, helping to prevent washed out pictures which is common with most digital cameras when you use the flash.-flips landscapes pictures that would normally appear sideways. the camera lets you flip these pictures rightside up so you won't have to do it on your computer.-can take panoramic pictures.-the camera is customizable! What does this mean? This camera lets you customize the startup screen. You have an option between clear blue water, evening skyline or a sitting bird. You can change the startup sound, your options include a default theme, science fiction and animal sounds(dog barking or bird chirping). These sounds are designed to presumably match the startup screens but they can be mix and matched. The shutter also has various sounds you can choose from. All these sounds can, of course, be turned off.-this list goes on and on. Check this camera out to see everything.* Superb true true-to-life daytime and night pictures.* Pictures come out crisp and sharp with or without the flash, in brightly lit or darky lit areas.* What you see is what you get. What you see on the LCD screen is usually how the pictures will appear on your computer monitor or when you print them out. The LCD, when you press lightly on the shutter button, will show you actually how the picture will appear once viewed on screen or on paper. So if your LCD has a bright contrast and you are in a dark room, when you press the shutter button lightly, the LCD will adjust itself to the actual lighting of the room. There will be no deception and you won't have to wonder why the pictures look lighter on the LCD than on the computer screen or in print.* Can record mini movies with sound.* Uses compact flash card.* Unbeatable price.There is much, much more that I can add on to this list but you will have get this camera and see for yourself.Negatives:* Joystick navigator takes some getting used to. Very hard to maneuver through the menus resulting in accidently going to the wrong options.* There is no power button. You have to shut the lens' lid to turn off the camera. This makes me nervous. I'm always scared that this will somehow damage the lens.* The macro setting isn't the best. Sometimes the macro pictures can appear blurry.* Uses the very expensive NB-2L rechargable battery as opposed to inexpensive, more common rechargables such as NiMHs or other types. Plus NB-2Ls can only be used with PowerShot S30, S40, S50 cameras and Elura 40mc camcorders.

So, in that amount of time, I had been doing research and digging to find the best camera.  Also in that time, things have changed considerably.When my wife and I finally decided to buy a camera, I asked her what she wanted.  Two things where placed before me to find in a good digital camera.  These things were small size (so when we visit over seas, it is easily concealable) and great point and shoot capabilities.  With these things in mind, I also wanted something that is going to provide great photos for at least 3 years to come, the ability to take micro-drives, the ability to use AA batteries and lots of manual control.The PS S50 lived up to 90% of all of these things.  It can be set to fully manual for creative control, it is 5.0 megapixels and at superfine compression, is enough to provide me with 8x11 size photos (which I will never use (like I would never have used 640KB of memory 'hehe')), it is fully compatible with CompactFlash type 2 (i.e. microdrives), it can be used in fully automatic mode with 9 auto-focus and auto-exposure zones and takes great photos plus, it's only 4.5in x 2.25in x 1.75in!The one item it didn't match was that it didn't take AA batteries.  This is a big disappointment to me because I had just purchase a number of very high quality rechargeable NiMH batteries for our wireless keyboards and mice.  This is the sole reason I gave it 4/5 stars.  It's that give of deal to me that I can't go to the store and purchase some emergency batteries if something happens to my set.  However, I couldn't find anything that compared to it in another brand and would take the batteries, so, here I am.But, I was able to find a third party extended life battery and that extends the life about another 1/3 to half.  The proprietary rechargeable batteries are becoming the thing, and there are few digital cameras that still take AA's.The fully automatic photos are amazing in bright light and the newly designed flash fills the room with enough light to make it seem light day-time!  But the camera does have some issues with the focusing in lower light situations.  At these times, a tripod almost becomes a necessity to get crisp clear photos.  Which brings me to the fact, yes, it does have a metal tripod mount on it.  Great for many Christmas photos!  Or pictures of you pets (poor sad pets).So, moral of the story, great camera, stupid battery, fits in your pocket, and if you look in the right place, you can find it for $400 right now, plus a third party extended battery for less money than a Canon normal battery.  Defiantly worth the money, plus, it lets me try my hand at creative photography (it ain't good folks).  P.S. It comes with a 32MB Flash card which is a joke if you ask me.

I agonizingly researched numerous digital cameras for months and results always seem to conclude that the Canon S50 is highly rated and was a consistent editor's pick.  I am a die-hard Olympus fan with their lens construction, which utilized \"ED\" extra dispersion glass.  My old (now bulky) IS-1 point-and-shooter gave me stunning photos which actually once exceeded a professional wedding photographer's pictures at a cousin-in-law's wedding.  I can safely say that I can easily match those vivid results with the S50.  The features bundled with this camera are immense.  I have yet to get through them all and the journey can only get better.In researching other \"user\" reviews I discovered complaints about the flimsy lens cover/slider door and an LCD screen that scratches easily.  I appreciated that advice and I now exercise caution in the operation of the slider door with no problems so far.  The door seems durable enough to last for the years of use.  As far as the LCD screen damage, as a Pocket PC owner I wisely purchased a package of ten plastic screen protectors to eliminate stylus damage.  I cut one sheet down to size and rubbed it onto the S50's LCD screen.  It works and looks very good and they are easily removable thanks to the use of a light adhesive.  You can purchase them at any local computer products retailer.The battery life is fair and upon the cameras initial use, the built-in memory battery needed to charge off of the removable one, so your first run will drain the battery fast.  After that you should see your performance increase according to your camera's operational settings.  I will however, purchase a spare battery or two as well as the AC and DC adapters.  External card reading and writing devices are a must to conserve power and again, my Pocket PC and laptop are invaluable for this as you can view and edit CompactFlash cards with ease.That said, the world is my oyster and I continue to see the quantum leaping advantages to digital photography.

It took me about a full month to get used to all its nuances. But if you are interested simply in \"point and click,?a few hours should do the trick. The  \"auto?setting is more than enough for typical use. You won't regret this purchase.NEGATIVES: (mostly minor):1) Battery meter. You only get a 2-minute warning, and then the camera shuts off. The battery life is pretty short if you use the LCD screen. The battery lasts about 2-4 hours depending the degree of use. (It takes about 1-1.5 hours to recharge).2) Lens cover feels a little flimsy. Enough to cast a slight doubt about its durability. Although I have had no problems with this whatsoever so far.3) It is not the smallest size in its class. In fact, it feels somewhat heavy, if you are used to ultra-small products. If you put the camera in your pants pocket, you definitely feel its weight.  4) There is no way to attach a camera filter to the lens. I had to improvise by manually holding a filter to the lens while I shoot. And the range of exposure time can be a bit wider.  I occasionally need exposure times of a few minutes or longer, and that is not allowed with the S50.5) The auto focus can get \"fooled?in low light situations. You just have to be patient and work with it a little to get it right. Usually a repeat shot is all that is required. (If the subject is far away, I use~ manual focus and set it at infinite?) POSITIVES:1) Picture quality ?this camera takes amazing, breath-taking pictures. I have never seen a camera like this which produces such professional quality photos so consistently! The color balance is simply spectacular. (For color balance, I use \"vibrant?setting). The \"auto?setting does its job admirably most of the time. I use the Canon printer i860, and the 8 x 10s will knock your socks off. Guaranteed. (With a 256 mb card and at \"superfine? setting, you will get 99 photos).2) Quality of product ?this may sound like a non-PC comment and a gross overgeneralization, but I love the fact that this product is not made in China. Many Chinese products that I have had simply broke down after a little use, and I always felt like I was getting ripped off. The camera is a Japanese product and the battery is a Korean product, so both are A-OK in my book.3) Movie making ability ?Although not the highest resolution (and the limit is 3 min), the ability to make a movie is a nice touch.

Since then, I felt the need to try my hand at it. The old saying goes that it's not the camera, but the photographer that makes the pictures - but when you're starting from scratch, and especially in digital, you'll want something you can grow into.After doing a lot of homework I decided that the S50 was the camera for me. My biggest concerns when deciding on a camera were it's megapixels, features, and portability. 5MP is enough to do enlargements up to a reasonable size with cropping, and even though I haven't made prints as large as I possibly could, I like having the option for when I will eventually need it. The detail in the pictures really stands out when you have them displayed at full size on your computer. All the camera's settings and modes are top notch and as a photographic novice I found it very easy to use all the advanced features without having read the manual. And as far as portability goes, handling it at the store made me appreciate the solid construction that went into it. It fits well in pockets too, though not as well as other cameras.So, why not the flip screen on the A80? The S50 felt much more well built to me. Why not the full fledged features on the G5? The S50 is small enough that I'm willing to take it with me wherever I go, rather than \"when I'm in the mood.\" Why not a comparable Nikon or such? Again, I felt like I got everything I needed in one package with the S50.Do I have any regrets? Not really, though now that I've \"grown into\" the camera, I wish the aperture range was not so limited on full telephoto, but you won't get much out of any of the prosumer cameras in that respect. On camera flash is bad in every way. And I carry a spare battery with me when I'm out - factor that into the cost of your purchase; the battery life is decent, but not great.

My two major candidates were the S400 and the S50.  I was unfortunately disappointed in the S400's ability to focus reliably and produce good sharp well saturated pictures while the S50 performed like a champ.  If you follow the photography boards at all you realize that this is a fairly common dilemma - the S400 vs the S50.  The S50 offers excellent manual controls while the S400 is significantly smaller without any manual control whatsoever other than exposure compensation.  I LOVED the look of the S400, but unfortunately it was too small for my large hands and I either couldn't hold it steady or the darn thing wouldn't focus properly even though I set the focus mode on just the center focus square would should have given me substantially more focus control.  This camera is simply beautiful, but for me it just wasn't producing the excellent results I've gotten with the S50.  The S50 offers considerably more user controls than does the S400.  I could have lived without all the manual controls since I own the 10D and since this camera was primarily for my wife.  But I couldn't live without reliable focusing.Several have pointed out that since the S400 is so small it will always be with you whereas the S50 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size.  I'm not sure that I buy this argument since I wouldn't carry either camera in my pocket.  I'm well aware of the glowing reports re the S400 and I sincerely wish it had worked out for me since I love the form and size factor, but at the end of the day picture quality was WAY more important to me than absolute smallness and the S50 just performed better for me.  ON the form and size factor alone the S400 gets the nod, but on the more important function front the S50 just worked better for me.I am a huge fan of the Canon cameras and I would advise anyone looking for a camera, whether a point and shoot or a DSLR to carefully consider the Canon line since, in my opinion, it is currently the state of the art.", "Date": "March 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Fantastic pictures, little adjustments!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3R9QLGUW8AXXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just a quick review of this camera to hit on one main point.

This is almost equal to the manual capabilities of a good SLR but you do not have the lense options.  The only down side that I see to this camera is that you will have to read the manual to figure out how to best use all of the preset modes or how to make the manual adjustments.

This is a dandy little performer--great for taking snapshots and action shots in places or situations where a larger camera might simply be too much trouble.  The pictures this camera is capable of taking will not disappoint.The S50 is a bit more complicated to master than the average small point-and-shoot digital simply because it features a lot of options--unlike many small cameras, this one provides a lot of flexibility for settings.

I bought it after much thought vs the Canon G5 or the newer Olympus cameras, and overall I'm relatively pleased, but I did have my share of problems with it. First of all, the reviews stating that the mechanical door is somewhat flimsy are absolutely correct. It's nice not to have to worry about accidentally turning on the camera, but my first S50 had a malfunctioning sliding door (it wouldn't open completely), and I had to exchange it for another one, which has worked fine.Second, the exposure settings and picture resolution out of the box are not optimal considering the 5 megapixel CCD sensor, which is one of the major selling points of the camera. My shots were consistently underexposed, and the low resolution settings seemed more designed to fit on the woefully small included compactflash card than to provide good shots. It was easy to change the settings through the extensive menu, but with a point and shoot one expects good pictures without having to tinker with the settings. On the plus side, the camera is very feature-rich, and the image quality is good once the settings are tweaked. Also, the small size makes it easy to carry around, which is the main reason I chose it over the larger G5. A major draw is the ability to save images in the RAW format, which many other manufacturers lack. The RAW format can be thought of as the name suggests - a \"raw\" image without any noticeable compression that might degrade quality. In comparison, a JPEG is considered a \"lossy\" format, in which one sacrifices some detail in order to have a smaller file size. Once I bought a 512MB compactflash, I saved all my images as RAW files and adjusted them on the computer.The included Arcsoft and Canon software are not really very good, and you'll get much better mileage from Adobe Photoshop/ Photoshop Elements or Paint Shop Pro.To summarize,Pros:Small sizeGood picture quality once default settings are changedRAW image format capabilityFeature-richCons:Mechanical sliding door can give problemsOut-of-the-box image settings less than optimalSlow shutter speedInadequate Compactflash card includedNeed to open battery door to get at Compactflash cardSo-so included software", "Date": "March 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good point & shoot digital", "Author": "Zachary P.

On my old Olympus 3040, you had to switch the camera dial to \"Review Mode\" to look at the pictures you just took. If you wanted to take a picture while reviewing, you had to switch it back quickly, hope you flipped it to the right shooting mode dial setting, and shoot. With the Canon, you enter review mode by flicking a spring-loaded switch. Review mode can always be instantly cancelled by pointing at a subject and pushing the shutter release halfway down. You're instantly back in the right shooting mode. It sounds like such a simple thing, but it makes the camera much easier to use.That's just one of the nice things about the S50. It also has orientation detection (it knows if you held the camera vertically or horizontally when shooting), multiple focus points, and quick startup and shutdown (just open or close the front panel).Since it's in a small body, there are some sacrifices. The lens is not very fast; expect to use the flash or a tripod when there's not a lot of light. The flash is also underpowered, having difficulty lighting a scene after about 12 feet.

Since a digital SLR body was out of my price range, i researched maybe 15 compact digitals before settling on the S50. I'm thrilled with my purchase and would recommend this camera even to folks who, like me, are used to higher-end SLRs. The S50 offers an incredible array of features and options in an improbably small package. I've had it for about six weeks and have yet to take advantage of all the bells and whistles. Although the camera offers options galore, its controls are pretty intuitive. And despite its myriad features, you can use it right out of the box in its \"Auto\" mode.Its color fidelity is stunning -- even with magentas, which some digital cameras don't capture well. Its automatic white balance is also superb; it produces none of those ugly casts you get with cheaper digital cameras. If you prefer to set the white balance yourself, though, this camera gives you plenty of flexibility.I've had very good results with the focus. The couple of blurry pics I've gotten were probably my fault because I didn't give the camera enough time to focus. The focus lock seems pretty quick - comparable to that on my SLR.There are a couple of areas in which this camera doesn't perform as well as my SLR (an unfair comparison, but worth mentioning). One is the slight, occasional shutter delay. This can be annoying but it's not the end of the world for travel and family shots. If you're big into anything that involves split-second action, though, I'd recommend you stick to an SLR.I must also echo other reviewers' comments on the flimsiness of the lens cover. I contemplated returning the camera because of this but was so impressed with the quality of the pictures that I instead resolved to handle the cover with kid gloves. It's helpful to note that you don't have to use the lens cover at all, if you're worried about it... the camera powers down automatically after a while, and you can wake it up again by depressing the shutter. (Of course, this option leaves the lens exposed to dust and scratches...)That said, the S50 offers a couple of huge advantages over film cameras. One is its performance in low-light settings. I've been amazed at the S50's ability to capture pictures indoors, without a flash.  No funky purple ghosting, either!And I love the LED screen that's built into the back of the camera. It has pretty good resolution so you can tell what's in focus, and you can adjust its brightness depending on whether you're shooting indoors or out. It's great to be able to compose your shot without having to mush your glasses against a tiny viewfinder, and it's even better to be able to review your photos at the end of the day.The software that comes with the camera is easy to install and intuitive to use (on a Mac, anyway - can't vouch for the PC version!). The 32mb memory card that comes with the camera, on the other hand, is inadequate... I'd recommend buying a card with at least 128mb of storage.  An extra battery couldn't hurt, either!On the whole, I think this is one of the best compact digital cameras on the market today, and certainly in its price range.

While this and most similar digital cameras take some very clear shots, there are too many cases where digital distortion and blurred photos are the result of the current state of digital camera technology. I bought this camera over some less expensive models in hopes to take advantage of the many manual features the camera has to offer. Most highly of these, I looked forward to manual focus. As far as I'm concerned, this feature is just not worth the frustration of using. The same goes for some of the other manual settings available on the camera. It's much easier to get a great picture using the manual controls on the standard 35mm camera. While I'm very happy with this camera for it's quality in construction and ease of general use, I don't reccommend this camera for those who are interested in the manual features. If you find a comparible digital camera without the manual settings, I would choose that one instead. If you want control over your pictures, either buy a digital camera over $1000 or stick to the trusty 35mm for the time being.

We played around with them and our own cameras and made some comparisons.  First a few comments about F&F (features and feel).  The S50 has a very solid, well made feel to it, especially considering the very reasonable price - you can get it for well under the $600 retail pricetag.  Second, this guy has many features you won't get without spending quite a bit more money.  For example, the integration of the exposure mode controls are very logical and functional, with a very usable manual exposure mode and wide exposure compensation.  The included software has an image stitching capability for assembling panoramas and it works fine.  The autofocus system works well and has some interesting options for shooting difficult subjects, such as when the object of interest is off-center.  The image processor is called DiG!C and supposedly enhances the image quality beyond what you'd expect from a 5 MB CCD.  We compared images from the S50 to our Olympus C-50 and our Sony F707.  The S50 did quite well, in some cases looking slightly sharper than the C-50, but in general falling short of the F707.  Note that the F707 retailed for over $1000 and has a large Zeiss lens which I expect is a significant contributing factor.

And I love the 'intervalometer' which allows me to make time-lapse movies of things such as beautiful sunsets.The bads:The markings on the selector wheel have completely rubbed off. I have to look on-screen to guess what mode I am in.To push the selector SET button in without pushing left or right requires just the right touch. I much prefer separate select button as on some other models.The lens cover also requires a certain touch to close it properly, since it doesn't stay in its track perfectly. This is easily learned, unlike the selector button.Special-purpose battery is expensive! Why not use AAs?Only focuses up to 10cm.  Macros are not that macro.Focusing close in low light is virtually impossible, even with manual focus.To have a shutter sound a second after releasing the shutter button is worthless. It makes taking pictures from a moving vehicle very hard to time.Some more GOODS:  It is surprisingly sensitive, and takes excellent night shots of things like christmas lights, or shots from indoor lighting even without a tripod.Sound annotation and movies are very handy!The flash is very flexible, with 1st or 2nd curtain, variable brightness.The digital zoom (from 3x to 12x) is quite good.It is pretty solid.

Prior to purchasing the digital camera, I did a hefty amount of research to ensure myself that I was indeed purchasing a product that would last. After comparing countless cameras to one another through the Internet and shopping centers, I settled on the Powershot S50.The camera (overall) is incredibly easy to operate, and provides the user with an immense amount of features to explore and expand upon. I quickly learned how to decide on a specific shooting mode for each shot, without much fuss. I also found it very simple to become comfortable and confident while shooting manually with the S50.This digital camera produces vibrant colors and crisp images with almost every photograph or snapshot taken. The automatic white balance (with or without setting it yourself) compliments each shot, and allows for flexibility. There is rarely a need to adjust anything more than the brightness and contrast of a photograph in Photoshop, which is not the case for many other digital cameras. S50 is also capable of functioning well without a flash in a low-lit environment!The body of the S50 is a perfect size, sturdy, and survived (with only one small scratch) a dreadful fall on the kitchen ceramic tile. Also, the LED screen placed on the backside of the camera allows the user to see what exactly they are photographing.There is no need to worry in regards to loading S50s software on a Mac, or PC. Both are \"user-friendly\" and will not be found troublesome!Aside from all of the upsides to purchasing the camera, there are, of course, minor (but worth mentioning) issues I was and am not satisfied with. I have not experienced anything negative with the sliding lens cover as other reviewers have, but can agree with its (occasionally) slow reaction time. I have missed a shot I desired to capture on more than one occasion because S50 did not react quickly enough.Along with this, I have and continue to struggle with the usage of the flash. Photographs either appear too bright or not bright enough. I have yet to settle upon middle ground with S50. However, Photoshop and other photography programs can easily adjust this issue if needed (along with the commonly complained about red eye). The battery life is also an issue to struggle with. It is best to carry another with you, as the camera will not specifically indicate when it will be out of battery power.I would recommend this camera to anyone in need of a reliable buy, as well as a larger memory card (mine being 256MB).

Are you just getting started out in digital photography?  This particular camera has a lot of bells and whistles but if you don't take the time to learn the features then it may be a bit of an overkill. The manual has a nice layout, but for the amateur photographer, its not going to be enough explain the functions in detail.2. How portbable do you want the camera to be?This is a medium sized camera. Not quite small and light enough where you feel comfortable slipping it into your pocket and heading on out. But at the same time, not a big contraption that is bulky and difficult to manage. Recommendations:1. Buy a bigger memory Card - With a 5 megapixel camera, I highly recommend getting at least a 256mb memory card.2. Buy a USB 2.0 Memory Card Reader - While the camera comes with a cable that connects to your computer for downloading images, the USB 2.0 Reader is lightning fast. For example, suppose that a download may take 5 minutes with the supplied cable, that same download will only take 45 seconds with USB 2.0. If you plan on taking a lot of digital pictures, then this item is recommended. Just be sure to check if you computer is USB 2.0 compatible.3. Buy an extra battery - More than likely that one supplied with the camera will not be enough if you plan on taking a lot of pictures during a trip. At least with the back-up, you can snap away without having to worry if you have enough battery power.4. Consider buying image editing software- This will give you more control over the finished product. You will be able to crop images, brighten them, sharpen them, take out the red-eye, etc...Again, if you are not familiar with such software, it may take some time to learn. Conclusion: This camera takes awesome pictures for the most part. At 5 megapixels, the images come out clear and detailed. There is a bit of a red-eye problem, and the flash is not very powerful. This camera offers a lot of features, but unless you are willing to sit there and learn what each function does, you may not need it. Portability was an important factor for me while wanting to preserve camera performance, and so I purchased this camera. If I could do it again, I probably would have bought 2 cameras instead. One really small camera like the Canon SD10, so that I can take it anywhere, and then purchase one bigger camera like the Canon G3. I figured that this camera is in between and compromised. Now I kind of regret it.

For the past four months, I've been continuously shooting pictures. I've carried the camera with me literally every moment of every day and I have probably taken about 5000 pictures with it so far. Prior to this, I was not a frequent picture taker. Additionally, this is my first digital camera.Overall, I am extremely satisfied. The camera takes beautifully detailed and rich images. On the superfine, large setting, it is possible to make large prints (12 x 12) with no noticible deterioration in picture quality. I previously shot on Fine, large but noticed some deterioration in quality on a similarly sized print, so I switched to the higher quality setting.The main weaknesses of this camera are the shutter delay, the focusing and the zoom. Between the shutter delay and the time required for auto-focusing, you can end up with a shot that is different from the one you composed. The zoom is a source of frustration for me. It just isn't sufficient to get the pictures you want (composed the way you want) when a subject is further than 10 feet or so away. I think both of these issues are endemic to this class of camera, so this doesn't detract from my appreciation of the camera.This camera has many options and really serves as a learning tool. It's simple enough to be used by a total novice as a pure point and click camera, but also offers enough control to start to learn about more sophisticated ways of taking photos. There's aperture priority, shutter priority and full manual settings.Other pluses to this camera are the fact that it is fairly small and non-descript. Many people are surprised to discover that it is a digital. That's good in my mind, because it makes it less stealable.Before I bought this camera I was a very vapid and infrequent photographer.

No way - this little package makes 8x10's as crisp and clear as my old 5-pound Pentax K2.

I carry that adapter cord in my mini zipper case because a large TV screen beats 4x6 glossies any day.Warnings/issues:1) The LCD screen on the back is fragile.  It scratches very easily.  It's also too dim to see in bright sunlight, so changing to the brighter LCD output setting has to be done BEFORE you get in full sun.  Catch-22.3) Buy a LARGE and high-speed compact flash card.  I shoot everything in high resolution so I can blow up whatever shot I like the looks of.  At 2Mb per image, it's very easy to fill a card up.  I usually shoot with a 512Mb Viking which writes each shot to card in about 1.5 seconds, and can store hundreds of shots.  I just cleaned that card off, with 185 shots and assorted movies!  Also, I just ordered a much faster Sandisk Ultra-II with 256Mb of space.  It should be interesting to see how much faster it writes.  Transfer to the PC via USB 1.0 cable won't speed up though - the USB 1.0 limits you on any card regardless of the card's read speed.

Happily, after playing around with it, I loved this camera.Pluses:1. Optics are crisp and sharp.2. Image quality is great.  5MP is more than any point and shoot casual photographer will ever need.3. Manual mode is a great addition.  You can shoot in aperture priority, shutter priority and full manual exposure modes.  Pretty nice when you want to get a long exposure for a nifty waterfall shot or to add a sense of motion to a sports/action shot.4. Nice finish that doesn't wear away easily like most point and shoot cameras in this class.5. Great auto-focusing and manual-focus controls.6. 3 minute movie mode.  Lots of cameras in this class cap it at 1 minute.Minuses:1. The little sliding door on the front to turn the camera on and off can become flimsy if this camera is used often.  I've had 2 friends that have had to get this part of their camera repaired.2. Great when it came out, but there are many smaller 5MP cameras on the market now.  This camera definitely feels bulky, but you can't hold this against the camera.  When this came out, it was the smallest 5MP out there.3. The flash is WAAAAAY TOO POWERFUL.  I hate using this camera at night because the pictures always tend to be washed out.  You can use photoshop and apply a adjust exposure filter and the images turn out looking great.  But that's an extra step.  I'm confused as to how Canon overlooked this.  I know 4 people with this camera, and this is everyone's major gripe.Overall, from my experience, my guy friends tend to like this camera.

Figuring out which one even comes close to being good is difficult at best. I came across this camera purely by accident when a friend of mine lent me his Canon Powershot S45. Image quality was stunning !!! and I have several 16x20 wall pictures to prove it.  It has everything that a professional photographer could ask for in a \"Point and Shoot\" camera. Manual operation allows the operator to dial in the exact exposure that the light meter may miss ( by the way, the light meter is more accurate than on my Pro-Canon 5D, 20D and 10D !!!!). It also shoots in RAW giving me a two f/stop exposure advantage over JPEG. Although the Exposure Compensation option is somewhat pointless, you can use it. I don't see the need for exposure compensation since an under/over metered shot may be different every time you shoot. Shooting in manual makes exposure compensation unnecessary. More important is the flash compensation, I can dial in flash power from full to 2/3 to 1/3. nice for correct fill flash. Most important to me, in this camera, is Manual, RAW and image quality.The only thing I don't like about this camera is that stupid door that you have to slide over to extend the lens. It looks and is flimsy and is prone to breakage. I have a Canon S45 and the door is coming off. Reliability is tops on the shutter. I have put 500,000 shots through it and it still works. I always shoot in ISO 50, as image quality drops dramatically in 100 and is lousey in 400. But ISO 50 is stunning, colors are right on.Canon should stop fooling around with all these joke point and shoot cameras and just re-introduce the S45 or S50 ( basically the same) .

I am afraid it is only a matter of time before it stops working thanks to the loose lens cover. Local camera shops send out digital cameras to be repaired and Canon will not even look at it for less than $150 since it is out of warranty.

It has a DURABLE metal casing.  I have dropped this camera numerous times on the concrete (including the first time I took it out of the package) and usually carry it jammed in my purse with my keys, mechanical pencils, you name it.  I've also taken pictures in the rain, which I don't recommend, but it's held up so far!  Mine is horribly scratched and dinged but absolutely no problems yet.  I do recommend an LCD protector.2. Sharp, clear pictures.  I've submitted pictures to galleries and miscellaneous publications; they've never had problems with resolution as long as it hasn't been much over 8x10 (but it's advertised to be ok up to 10x11).3. Intuitive controls. Lots of buttons & dials, but you'll pick it up quick or you can just ignore them all, and point & shoot on \"auto\".  You'll still get great pictures.3. Value.  At this point in time, this almost-professional quality MSRP $500 camera can be found online (NEW) at around $220. If you're looking for a Point & shoot that has some extended capabilities and isn't a clunky EOS SLR, this is pretty portable.A few cons:1.  Weight.  It is relatively heavy compared to other point-and-shoots.  I always use the strap to keep from dropping it, which I've done more than a few times.  It's not as small as the S500s which is a bummer.2. Manual capabilities occasionally tough to find.  As an amateur photographer, I like to use \"auto\" a lot but when I do use the manual focus/etc. it's not always easy to figure out where the appropriate menus are.3. Tiny viewscreen.  Nothing like getting home and realizing that the pictures that initially seemed so sharp and clear on the screen are blurred and out of focus in real size.  But this happens with most (if not all) little digital cameras.4. Night resolution.  Blah.  Has a \"night\" mode which is servicable but not that great.I love this camera and will definitely buy another Canon after all is said and done.

I agree with another reviewer, it seems like it could break eventually.  Second, the video only shoots at 15 frames per second.  This information was not easy to find - in fact, it wasn't until we shot the video that we were able to know fps on this one.  It's great that it will shoot for 3 full minutes, compared to our other Canon's 15 seconds, but I'd take less time and more fps.Third, you can't zoom while shooting video.  Again, a very, very minor complaint.All in all, I'd buy another one in a second.  It would be nice eventually to see them put the fold-away lcd panel on this model like the G5 has, but maybe one day.  At Amazon's great price, you just can't beat this camera!

It was supposed to be a great camera, but I found that its auto-focus never focused quite right.  Close, but never as good as I could do manually.I recently bought the Canon PowerShot S50 for my 7-year-old son, who has demonstrated a real gift for photography.  It's a great match for him because it's small (so it fits his hands well), it's easy to use, and it's very well constructed.  Unfortunately, like my old EOS Rebel, this Canon's auto-focus system is weak.  When it happens to focus just right, the pictures are great, and you really get 5MP worth of resolution.  But that's all too rare.  My Nikon Coolpix 990 (without question the best camera I've ever owned) is only 3MP, but in real-life shooting situations it gets better resolution than this 5MP Canon does.  Keep this in mind: getting the wrong focus (or shaking the camera) by just 1 pixel in each direction reduces the effective resolution by 4x.  So getting the focus perfect is *critical* for the 5MP to matter.  Even minor errors send you into sub-megapixel territory.Also, if you care about macro mode, look elsewhere.  It's really quite bad compared to other digitals.  It can't get nearly as close as the Coolpix 990, and again, it has trouble fosusing.On the positive side, the exposure is generally good, the color is accurate, and the movie mode is surprisingly good.  There's a bit of \"Max Headroom\" effect because it's only 15 fps, but it's so easy to use that we actually *take* movies now, whereas our old camcorder just gathers dust because it's too bulky to lug around, and dealing with tape is such a hassle.Overall, a nice product with much to recommend it, but check out the focusing issue yourself before you buy.

However, a vast majority of approximately 1000 pictures we've taken so far are out of focus.  Switching to center-point focus doesn't help.  If only one feature on a camera works it should be the auto-focus.  Do the five-star reviewers have low standards, or is my camera defective?  I noticed one other review that mentions terrible focusing ability, so I don't think it's just me.On the brighter side, the movie mode is surprisingly good and produces nice, sharp movies.  However, zooming is not possible in movie mode.  My five-year-old, 0.8 megapixel Sony Mavica allows zooming in movie mode.  C'mon Canon.  Get with the program.Battery life is good and charging time is brief.  I don't have a backup battery or the AC adapter kit and I haven't had any reason to need them yet.The flash is nice and bright and allows for pretty decent indoor photos even in relatively low-light situations.  The AF-assist light probably could have been left off the camera altoghther.  If you need it to focus in really low-light you don't have a good chance at getting a good picture.  Don't expect any red-eye reduction from it either (same AF-assist light stays on during image capture when red-eye reduction feature is on).  In fact, unless your subject is willing to incur retinal damage by looking directly into the stunningly bright light, there is no real chance of reducing red-eye at all.  Big disappointment.  Canon needs to utilize the strobe-flash technique for red-eye reduction.Bottom line:  It's easy to look at the very best images this camera can produce and believe it to be a great camera.  However, when you end up with pictures which are out of focus and when everyone in them has red-eye, you won't be thinking of the great picture the camera produced yesterday.", "Date": "July 5, 2003"}, {"Title": "A wonderful camera!", "Author": "David Enzel", "ReviewID": "R28W20O6V10YYL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera.

Tom", "ReviewID": "R1L33I3DC7X6G3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Digital point and shoot cameras should not be looked at as a replacement to film cameras, the quality just isn't good enough for anything important or for images that you need to enlarge. But, for the convenience of being able to email your snapshots or upload them to a webpage or online auction quickly and easily, nothing beats a digital cam. The image quality of this Canon is acceptable if you understand that you will not be able to match 35mm film quality. The color saturation on the images is surprisingly good however you will notice some milky haze around some of the edges and background if you look closely. This is common (and expected) for low and mid range digital cameras such as this one.My main complaint about this camera is that it is too bulky. In fact, it was so bulky and heavy that I ended up selling it to a friend and going with the Canon s400 instead.  For me, the real power in a point and shoot camera is size and convenience. The more convenient it is to lug, the more you will have it with you to capture life's precious moments.  And the s50 should most certainly be considered a point and shoot camera because it's manual controls are strange to operate and I eventually found myself not wanting to bother with them because of the way they are implemented on this camera.For instance,  being able to shoot at a wide aperture on the s50 is of limited usefulness because the zoom lens doesn't maintain the wide aperture when you zoom in even just a little. So during the times I used my s50 and wanted a shallow depth of field, ie. when i was doing portraits, the f-stop automatically changed itself from f2.8 to f4.0 or f5.0 when I zoomed in to frame the shot.  I thought to myself, I  might as well have been shooting with the smaller and more convenient s400! Also, you might be tempted to think that flash exposure compensation is a godsend, like I initially did. But in practice, dialing down the flash on this camera yields dingy looking images in lower light. I was dissappointed.  Also, the image quality was cetainly acceptable and I have no complaint there, however the image processing time and shutter lag was definitely noticeable, especially indoors in mid to low light levels. The s50 is just too big to carry around everywhere and subsequently, I did miss taking certain photos because the camera was back in the car or at home. I does not fit well in a shirt pants pocket and it weighs down a jacket pocket. When I wanted to slip it into my my film camera bag, it took up too much space and was unwieldy. My recommendation if you must have manual controls in a digital camera is to either step up to the Canon G3 or equivalent, or go to a digital SLR.  Otherwise, for a carry-around-everywhere camera, the smaller Canon ELPH series would be best.I never really used the tiny viewfinder and don't recommend that you do either. Why? It's very tiny and not convenient, and it only shows a portion of the image frame. Also, it does not show any information such as shutter speed or f-stop. You are much better of using the LCD screen and doing so will give you a \"what you see is what you get\" image on the camera.", "Date": "April 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "excellent quality for the price", "Author": "A.

I like the convenience of using a digital camera and the fun and instant gratification from viewing a slideshow on my Apple Powerbook immediate after returning from a trip!Things I liked:S50 looks cool and with the black metallic body is a piece of art. Its relatively small in size and the fit and finish is great. The camera has a LOT of features and very easy to use and learn.  The best part of the camera is that it takes GREAT macro pictures and human portraits in close-ups. It can be as good or even better than my \u00c9lan 7 with 28-90 lenses in that area.Things I disliked:But the biggest problem is that it doesn't take great pictures! In auto mode the pictures are not very sharp and the color are not so vivid like Nikon's. The exposure compensation is terrible and rarely will it take a correct exposure in difficult lighting conditions. Pretty much I can't use the Auto mode/s to take good pictures. I have to adjust the exposure setting and the shutter speed to get good pictures.  So this camera is really the digital equivalent of a point-and-shoot zoom camera like my Canon Sure Shot 115 but costing thrice as much!!!Other minor shortcomings are:The LCD screen can't be covered, the battery doesn't last for more than 100 shots and there is no handgrip to hold the camera. So you need a mini tripod as well!Further you can't add an external flash (the built is too bright for close-ups and too faint for big areas) or external lenses and macros or telephotos.Recommendation:I will strongly recommend you get the Canon G3 for much better performance for about the same price. Trust me, unless u want to blow up or print in 8\"10\" you won't see any diff from 4 MP and 5 MPI don't knwo why ppl are giving great reviews about S50.
