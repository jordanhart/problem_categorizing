It takes clear, sharp pictures and is really easy to use.  The video feature captures wonderful footage with very little shake and decent audio.  For a \"point and shoot\" camera this is excellent value for the money!", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Little Camera", "Author": "Christine A. Riley \"wildnsyko\"", "ReviewID": "R2N6T5J51ZQWGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the 3rd Fuji Finepix I have owned.  I've never had any problems with any of them and the pictures are great.  I compared this one to a Sony at the same price, and the Fuji won me over.  The Fuji now has the image stabilization which helps as I get older and cannot hold the camera as steady as I used to.  Great little camera for the amateur or professional.", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Gregg Perez \"Goyo\"", "ReviewID": "R3OKWILOZAW1HP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my second Fuji digital.  My first one had a view finder.  This one does not.  I dont think anyone should buy a camera that doesnt have a view finder in my opinion.  You just cant see the lcd screen in bright sunny conditions.  I love Fuji picture quality.  I like the size and the familiar functions.  I just dont like that it doesnt have a viewfinder.  No matter what brand I buy next, it will have a view finder.", "Date": "December 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Cam!", "Author": "StudentDoc", "ReviewID": "R3OYUMZ7X3Y56N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a thorough research before I bought this cammera.  For its price, I don't think you can ask for more.  However, the picture can be a little bit grainy when viewed in full size (I'm not sure if this is the case for other cameras as well). One more thing, I can't find a way to view the recorded videos on my computer yet. I can transfer the videos from the SD card to my hard drive but can't view it.  I can only hear the sound.Edit 8/1/07: I am able to view the videos with Quicktime player. :)", "Date": "July 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Professional quality photos in a snap!", "Author": "W. Bills \"Book lover\"", "ReviewID": "R1U2B3IEX5RES1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for about two years.  It has been on many trips without missing a beat.  I took my daughters to the park to take photos for a Father's Day project, & the photos turned at just as good as a professional photographer we had used for senior pix.  They were stunning!  The pictures were sharp & clean, the colors were bright, vibrant, & true.  We even had a couple of the pictures enlarged to 8x10 size & they were still just beautiful.The camera is easy to use.  It has the versatility to take video as well & the footage was very good & the sound really surprised me at how clear it was!  I didn't expect it to be very good, so I was pleasantly surprised.The manual is also a plus.  The instructions are clear & easy to understand.  You don't have to be a professional to understand the directions.I would recommend this camera to friends & family.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Overated", "Author": "Stephen L.
