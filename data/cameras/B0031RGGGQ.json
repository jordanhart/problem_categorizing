The large viewer, easy to use functions and picture quality are great for the money.  Unfortunately the camera would 'freeze up', meaning frequently after taking a picture none of the buttons would work.  It wouldn't take another picture, you couldnt access the menue, even the on/off button wouldnt respond.  the only fix was to open the battery door then close it to 'reboot' the camera. This problem started on day one and after a couple weeks was so problematic I had to return the camera.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Broken AGAIN", "Author": "a reader \"susan\"", "ReviewID": "R1D36HAYMA08WE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my daughter's 10th birthday.  I wanted a camera that took decent pictures but wouldn't have to worry about.  The camera has a cheap feel to it but takes surprisingly good pictures.  We had to return the first camera we received because it kept freezing up but the replacement is fine.  It uses up the batteries pretty fast, so I'd recommend getting rechargeable batteries. I wish I had ordered the case cover and picture card at the same time because we had to run out and get that after we gave it to her and the cases on amazon were more reasonably priced than at Best Buy.  Now it's 2 months later and the replacement freezes up and won't turn on.  Don't buy this camera.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cheap and it shows in the fotos and the build quality", "Author": "MCP", "ReviewID": "RL0W9UCGV8OSJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This takes only okay pictures and the battery cover latch started to crack after about a year.

I had reservations about buying a Kodak product but it was a gift for my daughter. It seemed easy to use and it was small and light. I thought the facial recognition feature would help her learn how to aim, but it is more frustrating than helpful. Unfortunately the zoom lens does not always retract,and I go through batteries like water. The expensive ones.It also  does not take pictures in low light, any kind of low light. I had film cameras that took better pictures by the light of the moon, using only 400 speed film.This is really only good for non moving, daylight photos taking sessions.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kodak camera", "Author": "Norma Halbardier \"blueviolet\"", "ReviewID": "R1XXK175E7PAD9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an okay camera for a second camera.  It is easy to operate, but not of the quality that Kodak has been so famous in past years. This was a refurbished item and an excellent price, so no compliants that way.  I only wish, there would have been a booklet with it, so I would have been familiar with the operation of camera and a Program CD to install on my pc, for downloading the picture.  I bought a picture card separate, so be aware of these things, if you decide to purchase a used camera.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value for the price!", "Author": "C.
