Buying these three items individually would be more expensive. The extra batteries and chip reader are great, everything else you can throw away. If you want to take care of this stuff spend the extra buying a real bag and sturdier tripod.When owning this camera you will def need more batteries it burns thru them pretty fast, but that is expected. I was on the fence about spending so much money but after seeing the quality it produces I am more than happy.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera + lenses, OK other stuff", "Author": "Samuel F Neal", "ReviewID": "R3EW5GLSW72RJM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great package just for the camera and two lenses.

Comes with two Canon lenses and they both have image stablizers and auto focus.  Other packages had the 75-300 lens but did not have IS which is the reason I leaned toward this deal.  Great price and arrived early.  Still reading the 300+ page manual so I can take advantage of full the potential of the 60d.  May even take a photography course later.  All the other accessories were a plus as well.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its a perfect instrument to work...", "Author": "Damian", "ReviewID": "R24LMZMBVIAYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "all of the parts of this kit are so good, to take the greatest pictures... and videos...

A fine and respected Canon camera. Great features. The entire kit included some fantastic lenses to get you started shooting a wide variety scenes. Although the EOS 70D has added features, this camera is perfect for someone wanting to step up from \"Point and shoot\" and explore how DSLR can show you a whole different perspective in photography. Excellent buy. Quite happy with the DavisMax store and Amazon.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Deal- Even with the cheaper items", "Author": "Clucas81", "ReviewID": "R1FOGOBXAQHK7S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The deal is great! Some of the equipment isn't usable with the camera: mini-tripod, regular tripod they are both too flimsy. Every things else is great though. You made need an adapter for some of the .45x and 200x lenses that come with it. Case is more like a lunch pail, so you will definitely need to get a better case. I agree with all the other positive reviews on here. Great camera, great lenses and great price!

The filters, main body, canon lenses, batteries, charger, and SD card are all excellent in quality and function. The rest of the stuff is sub-standard, but over all you can't go wrong. I returned the first camera due to a factory defect and had a nightmare of a time returning it for another. Customer service shuffled me between 3-4 different people and I could not get a clear response as to what was needed to be returned which led to an extended period of time before I finally reached a competent representative from DavisMAX named Regina who did all she could to get me the replacement. If it wasn't for that headache this would have been a 5 star rating.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great package deal!!!", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R2YWIEX6PRHVC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera kit for someone starting out. Tripod and bag are meh but otherwise I recommend it!", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product and Good Deal", "Author": "David K. Crabtree", "ReviewID": "R2GW6WNE76R1G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The headline is really the review in a nutshell. Taking into account what I wanted, what I already had on hand, and what my budget was, this camera and this deal filled the bill. I studied all I could find about all the DSLR cameras within my budget. I also looked at the features, the lenses, accessories, and support each brand provided. Quickly I shortened the list to the Nikons and the Canons. I wasn't after the most megapixles, the fastest burst rate, or who had the biggest lens. I wanted a bit of a tank. Something that was proven and would last beyond the hype. I wanted a camera body that would allow me to grow as a photographer as well as take great pictures right out of the box. The Canon 60D was the camera. Then I shopped around for the deal. I chose this one and here are the pros and cons from my view.PRO'sThe two lenses will cover 95% of my needs. These are \"kit\" lenses and have produced outstanding pictures. But I can improve If I  want to.The filters are fine but you will want to get another variable polarizer so you don't have to transfer them from lens to lensThe 16GB memory card is a good start. I'd put a couple of 32GB on my Wish List or get them at Costso.You need the batteries and charger but you'll need to get a couple of the plastic covers. $5 for three on line I think.The tripod is okay as a field or \"just in case\" item but is not heavy duty. I was surprised that it was Vivitar. A good brandEverything will fit in the bag except the tipod, and if you are just starting out it is okay. Camera bags can be a bit personal. Some think a back pack is  a good idea but you never see a pro using one unless they are Waaaaay out in the field. I have a large Canon bag with lots of padding with a little room to expand. It is to store my stuff, not to carry around. Why would you carry every piece of equipment with you all the time. You select what you need.The two specialty adapter lenses are fine and work as advertised, though they are no substitute for full sized lenses.CONSIf you have no flash the one that comes with this package may be a bit better than the pop up one on the camera. It is a cheap one. Put a nice one on your wish list.The mini tripod? I would never put my camera on it as it is just too flimsy. I've been taking photographs in a professional and non-professional capacity for over 40 years and have never found a need for this type of tripod. Then again who \"needed\" a pet rock.All in all it is good package for the majority of the items that came with it and I am very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$999.99", "Features": "Canon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera Brand New USA w/Manufacturer's Supplied Accessories\nCanon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens & Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS AF Lens Brand New USA w/Manufacturer's Supplied Accessories\n16GB SDHC Secure Digital Memory Card + 3 Piece Filter Kit Includes: UV, Circular Polarizer and Flourescent Filter and Hard Case\nTwo Rechargeable LPE6 Lithium Ion Replacement Batteries + External Digital Slave SLR Flash\n0.45x Wide Angle Lens w/ Carry Pouch and Caps + 2X Telephoto Lens W/Carry Pouch and Caps", "Name": "Canon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera w/ EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens & EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens Wide Angle/Telephoto 16GB DavisMAX Bundle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61X9w8-adXL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008I61W1O"}}
