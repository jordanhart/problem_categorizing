So I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars. There are a few negatives that need to be mentioned though. The picture quality is not great. If people or objects move fast it will be almost blurred, but most objects and people are captured just fine. The night vision can't see well beyond about 20 feet, but within those 20 feet it does a great job even in no light at all. Overall I would recommend buying this if you only had a few hundred dollars and didn't want anything too complex to install. I do like the intercom feature, however, sometimes you can't hear what the other person is saying at the camera end. I have to push a few buttons to go to different menus to get the sound to work again (even though the volume is turned all the way up).", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not so much", "Author": "Azhlynne", "ReviewID": "R36S2MDW5WXYZJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Right out of the box the 7\" monitor felt extremely lightweight.  My son's DSi seems heavier.  Hooking it up was very simple and no hassle.  However when we turned on the monitor at just after sundown and pointed it at the driveway the image on the screen was so incredibly dark that nothing was descernible.  All we could see was black on the bottom of the screen and lighter grey where the sky was.  We could just barely make out the driveway as a barely lighter, dark grey line.  We sent my son outside to walk down the driveway and there is no way we could have identified him at all.  Our outside motion lights came on and then the picture was good and pretty clear for about 15 feet or so from the house.  Even lit with the motion lights the farther he walked down the driveway the more indistinguishable he became until at the mailbox (about 60 feet away) he was nothing more than a small, grainy figure. You could not tell if he was a kid or a grown up, male or female.  We tried adjusting the settings on the monitor for brightness/darkness but the picture barely changed at all, that was a joke.  If you are looking for something to give you a good night picture in darkness this is NOT the camera system.  Without the motion lights on there is no good picture, with the motion lights you get perhaps 15 feet at most.  We were very disappointed and repacked the box to send back the same evening we received it.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "SVAT GX301-011 Wireless Security System", "Author": "Anna M. Peace", "ReviewID": "RDLJ1HCEEQO24", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received this Monitor with two security cameras.  It was very easy to set up.  I've had it for three days and I love it!  I have a long driveway and can see all the way to the end of it even at night.  My front door does not have a peephole so I set up the second camera there.  My porch looks like I have my porchlight on at night when I don't, the image is so bright and clear.  The only two things I would have liked this system to have is longer range antennas (I had to buy one for the camera watching my drive) and batteries for the monitor so it could be portable.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "SVAT Digital Wireless DVR (Good)", "Author": "Valerie", "ReviewID": "RMLEQQJ02T11L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Clear in picture, record for couple days, or how you want it to record., You can record over, & over again, I like it !!!!!!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "For the most part, I am satisfied", "Author": "H from SPhilly", "ReviewID": "R38F1GPE420JCR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I hired someone to put these babies in.  I find that location is crucial.  As for the housing of the camera being weather resistant, well it kinda sorta is.  When one of the two cameras stopped giving feedback, I was a little upset.  Neverthless, I've moved the monitor from the livingroom to my bedroom, and that made all of the difference.  Location, location, location!I plan on purchasing 2 more cameras.  They're pricey at $130 a piece.

Chrystal", "ReviewID": "R52Y2DYQ4PNKZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "About two weeks ago bought a one camera GX301 system from another online store.  Setup was simple and proceeded smoothly, but the camera had some difficulty communicating with the monitor from about 50' until I moved the monitor from its initial location, higher but the same distance from the camera.  I have had no known outages since doing so.The camera is well built but the mount proved difficult to adjust until I used a lock washer on it.  It records movement just as it should, ignoring small objects, animals, etc.  The monitor is of good quality and the manual is easy to understand.  Image quality is fair-to-good.  Currently I have the camera mounted on my garage under an eave, about 15' high facing the back of the house about 25' away.  It is easy to identify \"known\" individuals with the default setting but I think it could prove difficult ID'ing unknown others.  It has a zoom feature and that might show more detail.  Still, the picture is decent and could be useful information to police.  I do not know if image quality would improve if the SD card was placed in a computer and enhanced.  I have no use for the intercom feature.I am generally pleased with the purchase but wish the camera had higher resolution or two zoom settings, one of them intermediate; but, as the saying goes, \"you get what you pay for\" and I can't complain.  I would buy it again.As I write this it is snowing and about 30 degrees Fahrenheit.  The camera is working well and the monitor is recording.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "It would be nice ... if it worked", "Author": "Ann E.", "ReviewID": "R3TF15U9ZKIM70", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is really a nice surveillance system, provided that it functions properly.  I got it all set up, cameras mounted JUST where I wanted them, etc, and was happily learning how to operate it when the audio started cutting out.  I tried everything I could think of, but sound stayed on only a few seconds.  I used SVAT's online chat, and their tech (who was apparently consulting a manual) concluded that the audio was malfunctioning, and said he'd start the paperwork at his end to get it repaired or replaced, but warned me it might be much quicker to go through the Amazon.com vendor (UnbeatableSales Inc) instead.  So I tried that route, too.  When all the dust had settled, more than a week later, I had three choices.  (1) Return the entire system (meaning I had to dismount the cameras and pack everything up, even though it's only the monitor that's malfunctioning; and since the second camera came in a separate box, the entire thing is pretty bulky and heavy) and ship it back to UnbeatableSales at MY expense -- $20 even by slow ground -- for replacement.  I discovered, however -- UnbeatableSales didn't warn me -- that it was no longer in stock and I'd have to wait more than TWO MONTHS for the replacement.  (2) Return the entire system for reimbursement.  Sounds good, except if I wanted to buy from another vendor, the price is now a LOT higher, and the system would cost an EXTRA $110 with all of the shipping included.  (3) Send the system to SVAT for repair or replacement.  It took well over a week to get authorization.  Again, I'd have to dismount the cameras and pack everything up to send back.  Shipping is on me -- one way if the system is indeed defective, but BOTH ways if their lab tech doesn't agree with their online chat tech, and determines that there might have been a simple fix I could have done myself.  And, in addition to at least two weeks on the road, going and coming, it will take at least another 2-4 weeks for them to get around to looking at it.  Overall time without a surveillance system: at least 5-6 weeks, plus $20-40 in shipping.  (For some reason, Amazon won't let me post a negative review of UnbeatableSales Inc.  Wonder why that is.)", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "security real cool", "Author": "ronson80", "ReviewID": "RCTZ3E608Y6JA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this thing Rocks it does it all,motion detection auto record,setup infrared works excellent in total darkness memory card sd type,got an infrared spotlight with it also,lights up the whole area.hardly any wires,got it pluged into the big screen.great setup!!!", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "Digital Wireless Technology; 2 Way Intercom Feature; SD Card Recording\nConvenient 24/7 Lifetime Live Customer Support; Long Range Night Vision\nMotion Detection Settings; Indoor/Outdoor Wireless Camera\n24 Hour Scheduled Recording; Expandable up to 4 Cameras\n7\" LCD Monitor; Remote Control Access; Easily Connects to a TV", "Name": "SVAT GX301-011 Digital Wireless DVR Security System with 7\" LCD Monitor, SD Card Recording and 2 Long Range Night Vision Surveillance Cameras", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bdGs3XUQL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003Z3W4NU"}}
