This kit has an excellent selection of usable items in addition to this great camera which is super easy to work. It can be a point and shoot with the Guide and Auto modes but the picture quality of a pro.  We bought the Nikon 3200 in Red and it has a beautiful finish and color! It's not the typical color of an advanced camera and it is worth the step out of the norm making it more fun to use. It looks elegant!  We also bought the book \"Nikon 3200 for Dummies\".  This is a great reference, but gives a lot of pointers for us not so savvy with the new photography challenge.  We were very tired of buying mediocre point and shoots, missing special photo moments and ready to explore a more advanced camera ... this is a perfect place to start!  The shipping from Cameta Camera was super fast and the company was very pleasant to deal with, when we had one item to return.  Don't miss anymore events because the picture quality is poor with the one you have... you will not be sorry with this one!
