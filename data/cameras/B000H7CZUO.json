Great little camera!", "Author": "Gadget Queen \"Gadget Queen\"", "ReviewID": "R1DDGH3XN7YK3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know what the other negative reviewers were talking about, and I almost did not buy the camera because of their comments! This camera is fantastic!It is lightweight, small, and easy to hold thanks to the little bulge to accommodate two rechargeable AA batteries. Comes with a battery charger as well. Can use alkaline or NiMH batteries. Absolutely everything is automated--plus a built in guide to talk you through many common picture problems. Really great if you don't want to miss pictures because of fiddling around with manual settings.So far I have tried all the picture settings plus the picture stabilization mode (which is itself worth a fortune). The picture quality depends on which setting you choose (from super high down to low) for this feature, and also if you use the digital zoom instead of the optical zoom. Obviously, the optical zoom gets the better picture.This camera is also good for someone who has trouble holding a camera steady (like me!). It has many (most) of the features of a high powered model without the bulk or need to carry around a product manual to interpret symbols used to access different features. I have a big clunky $500 digital that you need an interpreter to operate which I put in storage because it was so difficult to use--it took great pictures with a lot of effort to get to that point! By that time, the subject had aged 10 years!If you just want a great point-and-shoot camera, this is it! The built-in guide is (I say it again) very handy, especially if you are unsure of settings--follow the guide and the camera does the rest--including changing picture modes, flash modes, and other settings to accommodate what you want to do. ADDITIONALLY it has a 22MB internal memory to use when you forget the memory card or encounter the dreaded \"card full\" error message.Pictures are NOT fuzzy, as some have said, and the color is good. The power button is recessed somewhat--but turning the power on and off is easy. Again, reset the picture quality and you may be pleasantly surprised at the difference in your pictures. Pictues come out crisp and clear, not with \"soft\" details (fuzzy).The lack of a viewfinder takes a little getting used to, but since I haven't used a viewfinder with other digital cameras very much (the LCD screen is nice and big and very visible in bright light if you change the screen to bright from the default of normal) it doesn't seem to matter.Unless you are an advanced photographer who wants SLR camera features in a digital one, GET THIS CAMERA. Advanced photographers will curse the lack of manual settings. The rest of us who want to take good pictures with a minimum of effort will be pleasantly pleased!", "Date": "December 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Olympus FE-180 camera", "Author": "David Lynch \"Best6Megapixil\"", "ReviewID": "R2QIQFP3PQ0SDT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Olympus FE-180 camera to take pictures of a new home. I love it. 2 AlkalineBatteries last for 400 - 500 shots. I have 512k xd memory cards and it holds334 pictures. Easy to scroll through pictures and delete one if you want. I have sincebought one for my sister and my mother. They loved the pictures I took with mine and sickof theres killing the batteries after 40 shots or so. My mother dropped hers out of case fivefeet to a concrete floor and it still works fine. Small dent in front metal case.(not Recommended) This is my 4th digital camera and by far the best yet!", "Date": "November 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great features", "Author": "3rdgen navy", "ReviewID": "R1J6WBYQC8KAK2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera prior to a trip to the LA area.  I'm still learning about it's features but found the night shot feature to be especially useful and looks like it's day time.  The video was surprisingly clear as well and the sound, well you can't beat the sound of the ocean.I am struggling with some blurry photos, primarily at night, but I'm pretty sure it's operator error.  Other than that, I love the compactness of the camera, the dial, the on-camera guide and the life of the batteries.  Amazing.  I had upgraded from a very old HP which seemed to just love alkaline.  Plus the power switch on that was easily turned on in error while in the case, adding additional drainage to the batteries.I would recommend this camera and I'm pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "December 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA!", "Author": "amdirien", "ReviewID": "R1T8YLE72F2YZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i think this camera is excellent, especially for the amateur photographer. the quality is amazing, the super macro setting brings out the finest details in an object, and the zoom is wonderful! the battery life is a major plus. for such a low priced camera, the batteries stay fully charged for a long, long time. there's no viewfinder, but i dont mind, since the LCD screen is huge. also, the digital stabilization function is great, especially in low lighting where the focus tends to get out of hand. overall, this is a great buy! i recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "May 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Olympus FE-180- VERY Pleased", "Author": "Gig Em Aggies", "ReviewID": "RIOK23MGOOCGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always used an olympus camera and have been extremely pleased with them.  I love my FE180 and use it quite often.  It is very easy to use and has a great amount of megapixels for the price.  I also enjoy the 16 different settings and the battery that lasts.  I have yet to had to charge or replace my battery and I bought this camera prior to Thanksgiving.

But I was not happy with the shots taken in the night with flash. Its fuzzy. The daylight photos are fine. But the night shots taken with light and flash, doesnt have clear pixel. It should have given better picture for the 6 MP. I earlier had a 4 MP Canon which used to give better pictures.

I paid twice as much for the 750, but on Christmas morning when we were trying out our new cameras, they took to a novice point and shoot user the same photos.  If anything the FE-180 was easier to start using had the same shooting guides as the more expensive model, and the convience of AA batteries that are easier to find if you forget to charge the Lithium one on the 750.  It doesn't have as many manual settings, but for my in-laws first digital camera, it has worked out perfect.", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good camera, for the price.", "Author": "Thomas C.", "ReviewID": "R24ZX3G8QOF757", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 7 months. It has worked well. Had to get used to the view screen 'no view finder', but other than that it's been great. It also has a 'higher-quality' video setting than most still cameras, with sound, but it eats up the memory quick so buy two cards (1 or 2GB each) in case you run short while on vacation.

A review at CNET says the pictures are soften but that's a politely way to say fuzzy. I took over 100 pictures indoor, outdoor close up far off and in some shots the pictures are clear but non of them are sharp.I got a lot of out of focus shots and tried using the digital stabilizer mode called DIS which is really effective in low light scenarios. But I could never get a sharp picture.Another issue I have is that after you take a picture it only stays in the display for about 1 second. If I want to view the picture I have to switch to the viewing mode, making sure my subjects were looking at me. I returned it getting the Canon Powershot SD600 which works perfect; it's worth the extra cost to take pictures that last a lifetime.", "Date": "December 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Couldn't even turn it on  -- What a wasted effort!", "Author": "Monica Melville \"Mandeville\"", "ReviewID": "RPCKFKP3KF83M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera at a Great Deal (Black Friday Sale at Fry's for $127.00).
