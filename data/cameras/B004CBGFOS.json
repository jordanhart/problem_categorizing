{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Motion Detection Reflects on Glass", "Author": "R. M. Mayhew", "ReviewID": "R2T9WFNXJO9WAM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My Lorex cameras have what they call a \"passive infrared\" motion detection system.  I know nothing about the technical aspects of this system, but when I install a Lorex camera in this housing, it is fine in regular light.  When it is dark, the motion sensing part of the camera reflects on the glass in this unit and causes it to display a starburst effect.  When motion is detected is goes off and the picture is ok.  At rest though, you can no longer see a picture in the dark.Installation was trickier than others have indicated.  I did not have a screw in bolt that would fit into the space allowed to mount the camera.  Maybe that part was not included in my package, but I solved the problem by purchasing a special sized bolt at a local hardware store.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product, exactly what it says it is", "Author": "Craig S.

Minor annoyances to be aware of", "Author": "Behzad \"Behzad\"", "ReviewID": "R1BP5QYW40MMFV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product at this price is an amazing deal. The issues listed here are simply minor things that people should be aware of when buying.1. The housing latch on the back is only semi functional. It does latch and provide some use in securing the lid down, but with minimal effort, I was able to pop the latch off the metal part of the housing rendering the latch useless. This is not a big deal as my cameras were mounted 20' up but something people should take into account when wanting to secure the housings with a lock (the lock portion does not affect the latch being able to pop off)2. The cable wire holes in the base of the unit are not standard size. They are about a little less than 1/2\" which made it difficult to adapt with my MC conduit cable/tubing adapters. Again not a big deal as I was able to put my pliers in the opening and round out a bigger whole that took my adapter, but just something to be aware of. Note: If you are not using MC aluminium or Liquid Tight tubing then the included adapter hole covers work well with RG59 cable.3. The interior mounting hardware is excellent. Very easy to pop in and out to get your camera mounted in just the right spot. The included smaller screws secure your location once you have that perfect shot. The quality of the metal and glass is excellent for this price point. I also like the versatility I have in mounting the housing as I was able to bring the mount all the way to the back of the housing and point it at a steep angle while still maintaining its full rigidity. Also doesn't seem to fog up and I am not using a blower.TL:DR Great unit for a great price. Just be aware of the non standard (1/2\") cable holes and non secure latch mechanism.", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, Solid product for a Great Price", "Author": "Roger F.", "ReviewID": "RQDGO1YP5KJVR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a covert surveillance system at my home, but wanted something more than obvious for the purpose of deterring thieves.

Pearce", "ReviewID": "R2URAEOIKPKFJL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought one of these as part of a weather cam project.  After putting a 16mm lens (for better zoom) on a Ubiquiti Aircam H.264 Megapixel Indoor/Outdoor IP Camera, I found that the lens cover included on that camera was not high enough quality, and it added a blur effect which became very significant after installing a higher zoom lens.  Removing the lens cover fixed the image, but created a point of water ingress, so I needed an enclosure to keep the camera safe from the elements.  This does that quite well.  The optical quality of the front window is much better than the lens cover that came with the camera, and distortion is minimal.However the mount is not very solid.  The mount flexes and the enclosure shakes in the wind almost as if it was made of plastic.  Fortunately, the camera has a fast enough shutter speed that there is no significant motion blurring even with a 16mm lens.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "father of 4", "ReviewID": "R3IF0W80W915KB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Prodcut came delivered quickly and in good shape.

Its about the same size as the ones you see outside wally world. All nessary monting and hardware is included.

It would probably work well with cameras that have a different mounting location than a center hole but definitely this enclosure seems incompatible with axis cameras.

It has an all an all aluminum housing with a glass screen.  All the hardware including hinges and screws is of excellent quality as well - no cheap plastic. In other words this is the Great Deal.It is obvious that this unit is intended for extended outdoor use in most weather conditions.  It doesn't have a fan or heater inside,but I'm sure those can easily be obtained if its an important factor.  It comes with wood screws for mounting so if you plan to install it against  any other material then I strongly advise purchasing the appropriate fastening items.In my case I will be using it as a deterrent only without a camera inside so will be placing window tint material on the inside of the glass screen.  Just 4x4 inch scrap from the local window tinters will do the trick.  Experienced bad guys are always looking for cameras when they are casing neighborhoods and I believe this unit will be an excellent addition to my existing \"collection\". In fact I may replace my other units since this one is so much better.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding", "Author": "Cutty Sark Sailor", "ReviewID": "R3T1L301XT9G8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Heavier than I thought.

Mounted two of these 15ft above ground so vandalism is not an issue. Appears to be very solid and accommodated our box camera without any issues. The challenge is focusing the lens while balancing on a ladder. Of course we expect this to work fine while brand new (and in the summer) but you really have to wait several years and wet winters to really determine if this is a good product or not.  Our cameras focus on a lit parking lot at night so IR glare is not an issue for us since we done use it however I would recommend external IR lights (outside the housing) if you do need it.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "J.
