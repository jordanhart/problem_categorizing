Got this camera system on a gold box deal and I can't say enough about how easy it was to set up. I can access the cameras through my smartphone, get alerts when there is motion detected, and the picture is very good. I have several friends who have seen this and then got one for themselves. Why a camera system? I have lots of wildlife, want to see what's going by my door and also was looking for a system that could show me if it is snowing before I left for my 45 minute commute home. (Not uncommon to get 2-3 feet of snow here). An added benefit is the video library that vuezone maintains for my account.Although Vuezone does not say there are outdoor cameras, I have a motion detector camera outside, on a tree, with a little \"roof\" over it. Have had no problems with it... The first day I used it, I checked my smart phone, vuezone indicated there was motion on the camera, so I checked it. Scared the crap out of me.....I saw someone in a pink shirt at my back door, panicked for a bit, but then after I caught my breath, realized it was a video of me leaving for work that morning....too funny!Battery life is great also...I ordered extra batteries when I got the system, but have not had to replace them yet, and it's been over 1 month now. I would recommend this system to anyone.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Motion could use a little work", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R3U4TXTMUK8FNH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Easy to install and use.  There's a lag between the motion and recording start time.  I'll receive some alerts only to see that whoever activated the camera passed before it recorded them.

The IPhone app is great - lets you view video, record, and turn on motion detection right on the IPhone.  Well worth it.  Thinking of getting a set for the vacation home.I would have given this camera 5 stars if you could schedule motion detection the same way you can schedule recording.  Having to remember to turn on motion detection before going to work and remembering to turn it off after coming home everyday certainly isn't foolproof.  Would be very easy for them to implement - scheduling recording already works great.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Useful", "Author": "Aramat \"Aramat\"", "ReviewID": "R1OVJDIRMMMNMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We get more use from this than I would have ever expected.  I bought the two camera system and came to realize that another was needed to get all the angles.  It's a doggy cam these days.  We check in using the smart phone app, and it's very convenient.  I have been impressed by the battery life so far.  The camera gets daily use for at least 5 minutes, and it hasn't eaten through a set of batteries yet.

Mangual", "ReviewID": "R34JPLBY32FLT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've only had these cameras for a few weeks (four for now), but my family loves them.  The cloud-based program that drives the cameras is dead-simple and reasonably priced for 2 gb of storage.  The camera itself is super light but tough.  We've dropped two from over six feet (butterfingers) and my cat's tossed one around for the better part of a day...no damage.  The video is on par with most basic web cams and if you set the resolution to full you actually get a great image, but no video...more like time-lapse photography.  But it stops motion well enough to read my brother-in-law's crazy t-shirts.Get one...get many!  Forget the wires unless you need bionic, Fort Knox style security.  People looking for that aren't on Amazon...are they?", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Veuzone rocks!", "Author": "S.

This camera does not have motion detection as our other two cameras but this is not a problem and they all work seamlessly together to cover the Great Room where our dogs play when we are not at home.

I live in an apartment, so none of the cameras are very far from the VueZone router.  At my parent's home, however, I had to buy a very long ethernet cord, so that I could have the VueZone router in just the right place where all the cameras could communicate with the VueZone router.In terms of picture quality, the videos and pictures don't look great on a large monitor, but on a mobile phone, or even an iPad, they look fine.  Most important, I can see what I need to see.I'm willing to over-look the one negative I have about this system - the fact that the range is limited - for one reason.  I've tried other systems, and the problem is that my WiFi is unreliable, and the other camera systems connect through the WiFi.  The reason why this VueZone camera system works better for me is that it has its own router, which is connected to my router via Ethernet (not wirelessly). The communication between the cameras and the router seem to be flawless. While other WiFi devices in my home don't work well, this product does. For that reason alone I give it five stars - it does what it says it does.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy set up", "Author": "WWTRAV", "ReviewID": "R8SOJOY648QJK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is very simple to set up and functional, it was up and running within 10 minutes, however, the pictures come in fuzzy when there is motion. The cameras use a magnetic holder which tapes to the wall, there is a disclosure that this tape would destroy the wall or furniture, so it is something that should not be removed. The system comes with a trial period to store the videos then there is a $49.99 annual plan or a $99.99 annual plan and it does not need a computer or hard drive to store the information.  I have not decided to sign up for it at this time as long as only one or two areas that need to be viewed, the price is still reasonable, otherwise at almost $100.00 for each camera, the system cost will add up.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy Setup and Good Recording", "Author": "Android Matt", "ReviewID": "R180L94OEFADAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to go along with the my VueZone system I purchased separately.

At one time I had issues with the vue-zone web (needed to view your camera system) going down for maint or ???  Have not had their site down for some time now, so all is working very well. The camera system does have a bit choppy video but you still get live action video. Serves its purpose for live home monitoring. Video just is not as fluid as you might expect. But you would be able to see someone walking around, or monitor what the pets are up to. This 4th camera is further away from the base than is my other 3 cameras and a few times this 4th camera was not online. Probably due to the area and long distance it is placed away from the base. I may need to move this 4th camera to a different area in the room? Over all, this vue-zone is the most dependable system I have used. Many other cameras I have tried and rejected from D-link and Linksys constantly would drop offline and or freeze up, requiring a camera recycle (power on-off), which is not good when you are not at home. The vue-zone system is usually always dependable and available, as long as your home ISP is up and working and as long as the vue-zone web is not down for maint. The cameras are viewable using the vue-zone app for smart phones and iPhones. Works extremely well. I view my home cameras all the time on my phone when away from home. The battery lasts seemly FOREVER! Only the base station-receiver uses A/C power. The cameras are all battery so can be easily placed where needed. Small so they can be easily hidden on shelves and out of view, and thanks to the battery no-cord camera operation. This camera has motion sensor for motion detection to auto record when movement is detected and or sending you an email when motion was detected. Email can have attached snapped picture(s) or recorded video attached for viewing. All these features are custom user settable to suit needs, or notification can be turned off. Auto-record can be set on motion detection as well as snapping a photo(s). Video and photos stored under your account on the vue-zone web (which must be used to access your cameras). Vue-zone does charge a small fee, monthly or yearly terms for web access (needed for system-cameras operation). And vue-zone often offers savings promotions for accounts members. After first starting with month to month, I was soon offered yearly promotion plan for under $20, which naturally I jumped on that offer. Around holiday time, promotions for plans and savings on new cameras usually comes out weekly.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Useful as nanny cam", "Author": "L Ma", "ReviewID": "RYVJ9BCS1ODGI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a reviewer put it, this product wouldn't be helpful as a security camera because1. the resolution is not high enough to get a usable image of your intruder unless up real close. Resolution is 320 or 640 (time lapse has 1600 but you'll be lucky to catch them at that exact moment its capturing).2. There is no night vision so you can forget about taking images after dawn or before dusk during which most home invasions occur.3. And even though you can adjust the sensitivity of the motion detection, the video capturing typically happens several seconds after the object that triggered the detection has moved. You would have to place the camera facing in the direction of motion and it would have to be at least 10 feet.It does however make a good nanny cam or daytime monitor (ie. monitoring the pool area or play area). Real benefit is1. monitoring remotely from any PC with internet connection.2. Cameras can be mounted virtually anywhere (indoor or outdoor) because there is no wires.3. Snapshots and video are stored online so you don't have to wait to come back to view images.There are other points but for the most part I wish they would make it optional to use your own setup (ie. web server) versus using their web portal.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "VueZone Camera", "Author": "silverado12775", "ReviewID": "RZC342DY2KI2R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Vue Zone system a couple of months ago, Worked great out of the box ,with little installation time, I have two camera's outside under the deck which work great in 0 degree weather, so I purchased this one for inside of my entry door, I can check my house inside and out daily from my work", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Didn't work", "Author": "Ahmed A.

If you set the time to 90 seconds, you will receive a email..but cant watch it! There is NO SUPPORT for this device!! It has evolved to what it is and has reached a dead end. No improvements for the past year.It is subject to interference on the 2.4Ghz band, so if you place it near ANYTHING (like a baby monitor/Wireless LAN/cordless phone/wireless speaker/alarm system) you can bet it will cause you grief.The design is OLD (Jan 8,2011) and has not been updated.It is obsolete, Vuezone/Netgear knows this and has no intention of supporting this product.Cameras have improved a lot over the past 3 years. The people at Vuezone have been friendly, but this is not a \"Surveillance\" device by any means. It's fine for a \"Doggy-Cam\" but forget it as a home security device, a waste of money. We now use ours as a toy for our Pembroke Welsh Corgi...we toss or roll the camera and keep the videos from that playtime. Yes it's an expensive \"ChewToy\" but thats all it's good for.Repeated calls to Netgear/Vuezone has resulted in little assistance, product has never lived up to it's description, nor can it with the current firmware it uses in the cameras and base stations.Please realize this is a \"Dead End\" product and it is \"what it is\".I can't rate it lower than 1 star.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Useless", "Author": "JEFF LEWIS", "ReviewID": "R33JWGEAKTRSZ7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was prewarned the image was less than clear.
