She is doing close up / macro nature pics and this camera WILL focus down to 1cm away from the subject. Incredible. 12.1mb is adequate for our needs and the Leica lens is OUTSTANDING. We have had super-zoom single lens SLR's in the past and then got rid of them because they did everything mediocre, not this camera, it does everything well. The next step up would be a professional multi-thousand dollar camera and for under $1000 this Leica performs right up to the top of the line cameras.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not an FZ150", "Author": "Pounce", "ReviewID": "RO5HB3QRDIJKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a Panasonic FZ150K, took a few pictures, and loaded them into my computer.

First, it fits my hand so comfy and balanced.  Not sure a man's hand will like tho. Controls are easy to see and function. Movable screen is a delight! Auto focus with stableizers excellent support exceeds my dreams. Now the final proof can only be seen in the quality of 24X enlarged printed pictures? I'll update when that is done with enough shots to evaluate. For now, thank you Leica, for the camera of my dreams!!!!!ps. Wish the flash was included and the correct card so I'd be ready to shoot out of the box and have no doubt what card to buy.

The CCD's are made by different manufacturers, the ones for the Leica brand are all tested but the Panny ones are only spot checked, differences in lens quality and coatings and firmware make for better colours and fewer aberrations at wide apertures.The V-LUX3 is 22 grams heavier again due to the noticeable extra build quality of all metal and electro-mechanical parts that's why Leica give a full unlimited 2 year guarantee against the 1 year Panny.The Leica comes with Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and Adobe Premiere Elements 10 that would cost \u00a3150.Then finally resale value (average second hand)Panasonic DMC-FZ150K \u00a3205Leica V-LUX3 \u00a3350So there you have it identical apart from a \"red badge\" !!!! and street cred!You can always tell a Leica, by the way it takes pictures - and by the pictures it takes", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but...", "Author": "P. Laird", "ReviewID": "R3Q2C0E1PE6U8L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Leica is a great camera. The zoom is incredible, the basic operations are simple (most of them -- I'll get to that in a moment), the photos are wonderful, the battery holds a charge for a long time.But...... unlike EVERY other digital camera I have ever owned, the process of setting up the mode for the built-in flash is completely nonintuitive. I have looked at the manual a dozen times, played around with the on-screen menus repeatedly... and I STILL cannot figure out how to get to the flash mode settings. It's simply ridiculous on a camera this expensive.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "JDP", "ReviewID": "RMA1Y25ZP1M8P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a dedicated DSLR user I wasn't all that enthused about smaller \"want to be\" cameras until I came across this Leica V Lux 3. I picked this one up last spring while on a trip to visit friends in Louisville. After grabbing a sandwich I noticed a camera store a few doors down. Once I got a good hands on feel for this camera I left the store to give it some serious thought. The reduced price was also a big factor. The next day I came back and the rest is history.As everyone has well documented this Leica V Lux 3 does share most of its components with the Panasonic DMC FZ150. The difference between the two besides the included and not so free, Adobe Photoshop Elements and Premier Elements is all in the lens. The integrated 4.5-108mm F/2.8- F/5.2 ASPH lens is generous. ASPH is just a simple abbreviation for aspheric. It basically means at least one of the glass's elements does not have a spherical design or a constant radius curve. I've never been high on the so called super zooms mounted on point and shoots. This 24x is a first for me. Its sweet.Bigger isn't always better. The 12.1 megapixels is more then enough for me. At 12 full resolution frames per second, the CMOS sensor is great at capturing my shots. At reduced resolution of 3.5 megapixels it can be pushed to 60 fps. My still shots are just as good if not better then my Nikon DSLR. The color saturation and overall contrast in my outdoor photographs is outstanding. Even my distant shots come in perfectly sharp and in clear detail. Noise has not as big of an issue as I thought it would be.This camera does sport an image stabilizer for free shooting aficionados. Still nothing beats a tripod or a mono-pod. If that option isn't available I suggest going with anything stationary to help the shot. For dedicated auto mode shooters, the real jewel in this camera is the auto focus system. With auto focus each and every photograph can be a keeper.I don't shoot video with this camera but it is more then capable of handling it. It shoots a respectable 1920 \u00d7 1080 pixels in 60 fps in HD format. The editing tool allows for quick on board deletion vice downloading to clean up. The built in microphone is stereo and outfitted with a wind noise filter. Even though I'm an old school viewfinder guy, the swing out 3\" LCD display is sharp and clean. Its one of the very few LCD screens that I do like.After four months of shooting, I have found myself reaching for this camera even more. For those quick shots or when I don't want to pack my Nikon gear the Leica V Lux3 has become the one. With a body similar to a slim downed DSLR, its a hard camera to put down. Whether one is a seasoned professional or the casual weekend user, I definitely recommend it.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is a Leica", "Author": "David H.

I bought the V-Lux 3 and gave my Lumix FZ150 to my girlfriend.  Now we are shooting photos together and swapping notes. Function is identical, so until we get into the software part, I cannot tell the difference.  But I like the reaction from those who know the Leica name and even those who stumble over the pronunciation and never heard of it.  Initially, there was a problem with display in that photos would not appear in the LED screen after they had been snapped.  Situation seems to have resolved itself.  I still do not know if there is something amiss in the circuitry.  As of now, this is working fine and I love the camera which is perfect for a traveler like me who would miss countless pictures if I had to switch lenses constantly.  Also, I wander enough dicey territory that i wouldn't want the risk of losing thousands of dollars of equipment.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Leica or Panasonic?", "Author": "L.Gauthier", "ReviewID": "R8MBF4DXX2M5Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is a nice product.

The price/quality relationship is the best I have experienced with any camera. I was a little concerned about the 12.1 MP and doing prints, but this morning did some prints at 8 x 10 and they are truly spectacular. It isn't until you start working with the output of this camera in this way that you realize the quality of it. I have a family member who has several thousand dollar Nikon cameras and this has matched the photo quality in many (not all...let's be honest) cases. The camera really shines in close up work, and, oddly, the quality of photos taken in full telephoto mode are also outstanding.

Now that I am learning more about the camera (reading the manual in its entirety), I am realizing all the amazing features of it.  I now love the \"light, cheap, and small\" camera, and would not trade it for anything else.  I did research before I purchased this, and forget your typical Canons or Nikons; Leica blows them away, both in price and features.  The camera's zoom lens is unbelievable.  The details you can capture are outstanding with the lens, which is standard, and the shutter speed option is fantastic, so I never miss a precious moment, which are hard to come-by when photographing a two and a half year old.

The same excellence applies to V-Lux 3 camera, which I bought for my daily outings, in order to avoid weight of heavy gear on my neck. I registered the camera by mail. No confirmation or response came my way. After 4 months the focusing became erratic.  I had known their customer service as one of the worst in the industry.  They respond after a long time ringing, put you on hold forever & connect you to someone who is too busy for you !!  They are kind enough to take messages, but again they are too busy to respond.  So I followed the instructions on their 800 number & sent the camera to Leica, New Jersey.  No response again !!  So, a week later I sent the repair unit an email for an update.  The following day the customer service responded by email & said the repair would be completed in 2 weeks' time.  The following day UPS sent me an email indicating that Leica is sending me something by air !!  I received it in 2 working days.  It's now in perfect condition.  And the customer service had no idea what was going on.  This a jewel of a camera shrouded by ignorant confusing representatives.All in all it took 2 weeks to have my camera fixed.  Very reasonable.Therefore, the lens is excellent but the body thus far seems weak.  If someone asks me about a similar compact camera I would recommend Lumix FZ150, which by most accounts is identical to Leica, minus the red dot !!", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "PERFECT!", "Author": "flint anderson", "ReviewID": "R2UT4KP1RE6AP3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ALL IN ONE MULTIUSE PRIMARY CAMERA.plus $300 less expensive since the V-LUX 4 came out.  superior quality, easy to use.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "LEICA V-LUX 3", "Author": "ANGELINA", "ReviewID": "R2MSR31RRGXM0K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OUTSTANDING CAMERA, It has far exceeded my expectations :-) I am very happy with my choice of camera - We'll done Leica!", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "John Morris", "ReviewID": "R3K7I5HLWVENSB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic pro-sumer camera.

The Leica V-Lux 3 is nothing more than a re-badged Panasonic DMC-FZ150 like L.Gauthier stated in his review.

To make matters worse, it costs about $200 more than the Panasonic so please, save yourself the trouble and get the Panasonic.
