You will have to replace the cameras if you are looking to use them in low light.  They are fine if you would like to use them in an area with good lighting.  I have these cameras setup outside around my house and I have replaced 4 so far (4 more to go).  The IR on these cameras is not very good as it causes interference lines due to the low light, which, in turn causes the motion detecting to be constant.  So,  If you are trying to use the record on motion capabilities to avoid recording all the time you will still end up recording all night.

We own the Zmodo Surveillance System with 8 Weatherproof IR Cameras PKD-DK0865-NHD and added our own 500 GB Hard Drive, making it identical to this package (same cameras, cables, and DVR).To be perfectly clear, this is not a high-end system with high definition cameras, but it isn't priced like a high-end system either. This is a budget system that exceeded my expectations for what you get and how well it works. Here are my observations:Our Use - We recently bought an old but very large building for my wife's business and needed a way to monitor the six exits and the retail shop space.Included:* Main Control Unit - this is a fairly small unit (smaller than most DVD players) that is has button access for most functions* 8-Cameras - these are also fairly small, good physical quality and include mounting hardware* USB Mouse - connects to Control Unit* Remote Control - gives access to all menu functions (batteries included)* Required Cables - 60' Video/Power cables* Power Supplies - one for the Control Unit and one for the cameras (uses splitters to distribute the power between the cameras)* Instruction Manual* Software CDFeatures:+ Camera; IR Illumination for night vision+ User configurable Options; Privacy Zones (blackout areas in the display), Motion Zones (areas where motion triggers an alarm)+ Network Access; Can be viewed on local network using Internet Explorer (required allowing ActiveX and would not work with Firefox) and remotely via a DDNS service (often an extra expense for a reliable service)+ Alarm Notification; Audible alert and E-Mail capability+ Display Options; Includes a VGA monitor connection and BNC/video out for TV viewing+ Remote Control; Really makes it easy to quickly access featuresPros:+ Setup; Basic configuration is surprisingly easy+ Image Quality; Good enough for basic security needs in both bright and dark settings (but see \"Cons\" below)+ Value; Lots of cameras and features at a reasonable cost+ Options; Can be made to do everything we need it to doCons:- Washed Out Colors; Colors are somewhat muted, but can be individually adjusted in the controls to get the best possible picture for the lighting conditions- Night Vision; Limited range, less than 20'Hints/Notes:* Alarmed Events can be recorded and searched on later* A 500GB Hard Drive can record 165 hours of video on this system* Placing a camera too close to a window will cause the IR to reflect and blind the camera when it shifts into night vision mode* Display can be set to show 1, 4, or 8 video feeds at a timeThis system covered my needs very well and provides a lot of advanced features that were unexpected in a budget system.Highly Recommended!CFH", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast delivery, decent unit for the money.", "Author": "Jason.

I set up 7 of the 8 camera, all of which seem fairly durable and are easy to mount.  The mounting screws that come with the package are fairly short, so I went through a local hardware store and bought some longer ones.  The metal mounting bases are sturdy for being a cheaper grade of aluminum, so you can damage them if you're not careful.  I don't really like the plastic knob on the arm for the adjustment but none of them have failed or stripped out or broken yet.  I have 5 of my 8 cameras set up outside my house, and through 3 rains I haven't had any issues with the signals or the images, even with some of the wiring being exposed to the elements.  I will say that the night function on the cameras is not that good so if you're trying to catch people doing things in the night time, make sure there is ample lighting for the camera to see.  The motion recording is very easy to set up, letting you mask areas of view from being motion detected and only recording when motion is detected.  The DVR is simple, compact and easy to set up, the only real issue, like most people that I had was getting it hooked to my network.  If you have an IPhone, there is a FREE program called. ZViewer, it lets you view up to 4 cameras at a time, regretfully not all 8 like some of them, it does have a PTZ(pan tilt zoom) control feature and even lets you save snapshots from each camera to your camera roll.  It does lack the ability to control the DVR remotely, but it funtions well and switched well between the camera channels.  Overall for the price I would say this is a great buy for someone looking to keep an eye on their house/yard/vehicles, and it fairly easy to set up.  I do like the fact the camera cables were all 60 feet in length, which let me set up views around my entire house without having to buy any extra cables.  It would be nice if they included 2 20foot cables, 4 60 foot cables and 2 100+ foot cables, but that's where they're gonnna get their extra money.  I did speak with the ZMODO customer service trying to get my network access up and when I did get connected the 2 times, both people were friendly and helpful, and got me going in a jiffy.  The DVR is also smart enough to let you name each camera channel, I named them for locations they are pointing at for ease of use and memory for me and my wife.  I have had it up for about 2 weeks and no camera has come undone, flickered(even after putting a staple partially through one cable), lost signal, or even moved.All in all, I would recommend this product.  One last thing, the kit does come with a mini mouse for use with the system, but no keyboard, so you have to use the mouse to type each password, setting or re-naming takes a little while, I don't know if a USB keyboard will work being hooked to the DVR but the mouse works fine.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall statisfied", "Author": "RZinAZ", "ReviewID": "RLNSDYLA6C83E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this for a friend who lives off the grid. She lives miles from anyone and was without any security other than her dogs. A couple of observations:1. The one thing you may not think about until it is too late, is the aesthetics of the system. This is true with any wired system.  You have eight cameras with eight wires that have to make their way to the DVR. While you could run the wires wild and get the same effect, I wanted to make this system look good. In my case, I have always done my own electrical, so I ran all the wires behind walls, through the studs and into new junction boxes. After a day and a half, all you see are the cameras, all the wiring is behind the walls.  I can not imagine the system with all the wires exposed...something to think about vs. the new wireless systems they have now.2.  When it came to hooking the system up-that part was easy. It was not without its issues, but you just have to read the directions. When I bought the system, on the Amazon sale site, it says you get 8 60' camera cords. In my case, it came with 4 100 footers, 2 60\" and 2 50\" cords. I wish I knew that in advance because I ordered some extra 100' cords, not realizing they were already included. Also, there was not connection to a monitor, so I had to by my own VGA cable ($15). The mouse that comes in the box is so cheap that I needed to replace it- I guess it worked ok but good grief!3. Overall, I am satisfied. You do get what you pay for- the cameras work good, night vision was good and with some ambient light, like a 25 watt bulb in the area, even better. I am amazed that for less than $300 you can get eight cameras and a continuous loop DVR with a removable disk. Costs me half of that to fill by gas tank up- so pretty good value.You can pay more, I was going to get the Lorex, but without seeing the more expensive system side by side, I guess I have nothing to compare it with. The Lorex would have cost me twice as much and this system seems to be a good value; worked well right out of the box.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "ELLSWORTH HVAC", "Author": "ELLSWORTH HVAC", "ReviewID": "R1RYV81CVZNG8R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The equipment arrived in good shape.

Scott", "ReviewID": "R23RN7IBLHC91M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ive dabbled with home security cameras in the past ... logitech wilife, etc.... but this is a really nice system.  I got eight cameras and the pre-installed 500gb drive.  First the cameras: they are well made, small but durable, each box has the mount and the screws to install them.  They have an adjustable shield for weather and sun.  There is a BNC video connection and a power connection on each camera.  The pictures are pretty clear, but not HD by any means.  They are not wide angle so if you have a large area to cover, you need to place the camera far away from the subject.  If you want to place the camera inside the building and pointed through glass, be prepared to forego the night vision as the camera emits a beam that reflects in the glass making it unusable.  You just have to install the camera outside.  Second the cables: one per camera ... they are long enough for the average installation (I think 100')  .... I went ahead and bought four 150' cables which turned out to be really nice for long runs.  Get the BNC couplers.  The cables are good quality, connections are well made.  Third, the control box: about the size of a medium pizza box, again, well made.  There are as many cables connecting to it as you have cameras. Plus the cameras require power, so in my case I have eight video and eight power and the main power and the Cat5 from this box to the router and a USB cable for the mouse ... in other words, be prepared for a lot of cabling.  Place your box near your router with at least 3 AC connections for power transformers.  Fourth, the software: the unit is relatively easy to set up if you have average computer skills. You have to tell your router to \"open some ports\", understand basic IP addressing etc.  The user guide is pretty poor (sucks) ... its full of acronyms but the Zmodo website has additional information.  I loaded the iPhone app and it works pretty well as long as you configure the device properly. Finally, technical support: I couldn't figure out how to configure the PC desktop program and called technical support.  I followed the directions on the website and established a remote session for their tech to have access to my PC.  Even though it took 42 minutes to get through (7PM Wednesday night) the tech I got was very sharp.  SHE got on my PC and went to work cleaning up all the stuff I didn't do.  (Wish I could remember her name to give her credit here ...) ...but the point is the tech I talked to was very good.  So here I am two days later and Ive gone from thinking about sending it back to now thinking the system is pretty cool.  There are a couple of issues Im still working on ... pan, tilt, zoom ... and audio ... but all in all Id recommend the system to the AMAZON community with a 4 out of 5 stars ...", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Product Bad after sales service", "Author": "Gordon Sampson", "ReviewID": "R1G8OEUZ91AOHK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this unit works great, night vision not too impressive.

This DVR security package system comes with DVR model# DVR-H9108V-500GB and 8 Cameras model# CM-C21606BK .....On July 17, 2012, I had ordered this Zmodo system (PKD-DK0865-500GB) through the seller EZoom Tek. (representative for Zmodo) on Amazon. On July 23, 2012, I received the Zmodo system. Over the next few days I reviewed the entire system going over the manual, bench testing all 8 cameras, BNC cables and DC power supplies. After this, I drew up some plans on where I wanted to install the 8 cameras, run BNC cables and a good location for the DVR and monitor.As for the 8 cameras, I installed outside in different areas on the house 6 custom made gray PVC weatherproof electrical box's that attached to the block wall just under the soffit and the BNC/power cable then goes from the attic right into the box. The cameras are mounted on the side of the box's and the camera BNC/power along with the BNC/power cable from the attic are in the same box with connectors taped. The 7th camera I have mounted in the garage and the 8th camera I have mounted in a porch area. Camera 7 and 8 are out of weather areas. As for the BNC/power cables, I ran all cables through the attic area and took my time attaching all cables to attic trusses with small cable clamps making sure that no cables were pinched or crisscrossing any 110/120 volt or higher electrical wiring. NOTE: In the manual it will say NOT to run BNC cables by high voltage wires. In other words, stay away from electromagnetism, this will play havoc on your camera signals.After all cameras and cables installed, system was up and running......for now.THE PROBLEMS.......ZMODO Manual: Written and printed in China, this manual is NOT user friendly and a lot of information is not given on how to do things and put settings. Things have been left out and some of the wording is not understandable. This system comes with a 2nd small manual that is a quick reference guide and most of the printing is so small that you will need a magnifying glass and some of the print is very faded and not legible.As for the Manual, you will need to do a lot of research on the internet to help you out with some of the settings and explanation of settings.ZMODO Cameras: With my DVR system I was sent 8 cameras Model# CM-C21606BK..Camera is: 6mm lens, 480 TV Lines, Horizontal, Signal NTSC, Night Vision Min. Light: 0 Lux (IR On), Iris Auto, IR Irradiation Distance up to 30ft, 1/4\" Color CMOS Image Sensor.As for the Cameras, after I had the system up and running, I noticed that the cameras that I had mounted outside were fuzzy, blurry and any green colors looked violet and blue colors and some black colors looked purple.NOTE: I checked all DVR color settings and monitor settings. Nothing wrong.At night the cameras do NOT work and will look all spotty, fuzzy, blurry and the night vision is horrible on this camera model#.. The night vision is listed as \"Up to 30ft.\" ... The IR (infrared) night vision will only illuminate an area of about 5' - 7' in diameter at a distance of around 10'.... When the night vision is working and someone is within the IR area, you will NOT be able to even see someone's face and make it out. If you want this camera to work for you at night, you will need to light up the area with bright lights.E-mail's from and to EZoom Tek. Customer Care AFTER ordering the Zmodo system.On July 17,2012, Received an E-mail from EZoom Tek. Customer Care (from outside of the United states) and was told, Quote: \"Thanks for purchase from EZoom Tek.I'd like to let you know we just sold out the PKC-4094S15 camera kit included in your system. Sorry for this inconvenience caused.We have ZMD-P4-BARBZ4ZN cameras available now. The 2 kinds of cameras are identical except for the appearance.The beige cameras have 65ft night vision rather than 30ft; 480TV line provide much more better image; and its 3.6mm lens has wider view angle.If you are OK to receive your system with the beige cameras as substitute, we can ship your order out instantly\". ....End Quote.My Reply July 17,2012, Quote: \"The beige cameras are fine, they seem like a better camera. Please ship when you can. Thanks\". ....End Quote.Reply from EZoom Tek. on July 18,2012, Quote: \"Thanks for your reply and understand. I will contact our shipping department to deal with your order and ship it out as soon as possible. A shipping email will send to you when we ship the product out. Any problems, please feel free to contact us\". ....End Quote.2nd E-mail from EZoom Tek. Customer Care on July 18,2012, Quote: \"Thanks for purchase from EZoom Tek. I was just informed that the camera kits PKC-4094S15 included in your order is back stock now, and i'm afraid our shipping department was shipped the original product for your order. Now turn to the beige camera stock out. Sorry for this inconvenience caused by this and hope you can understand. If there is anything else that we can do for you please do not hesitate to let me know\". ....End Quote...........................................................................So after getting my Zmodo system, the cameras that came with the system were NOT even the camera model# EZoom Tek. Customer Care was talking about on the E-mail's. Now that's fine that the one camera is back in stock and I'm being shipped camera model# PKC-4094S15 after all, but then to get camera model# CM-C21606BK with the system is very confusing. So it was NOT model# PKC-4094S15 and NOT model# ZMD-P4-BARBZ4ZN but received model# CM-C21606BK ?!?!?!?On Aug. 2,2012, I sent EZoom Tek. a long E-mail asking them why the Zmodo security system Model# PKD-DK0865-500GB is being shipped with very poor guilty cameras. I also explained to them I will be forwarding the E-mail to Zmodo about the cameras. On Aug. 2,2012, Reply from EZoom Tek. Quote: \"This camera is just a CMOS image sensor camera and it is do not a very good quality\". ....End Quote. So in the same E-mail from them, they gave me a link for better cameras. Looks like a marketing ploy to me....On Aug. 2,2012, I forwarded the E-mail to Zmodo that I had sent EZoom Tek. about my thoughts on the camera model# CM-C21606BK.....On Aug. 3,2012, Zmodo Support replied to my E-mail and was very sorry for the inconvenience about the cameras and the poor guilty. This is just part of the E-mail, Quote: \"In regards to the cameras that are sold with the DVR unit, you are correct in that the cameras are our entry level model and are made just for basic viewing. The cameras have a CMOS image sensor which causes trees and grass to have a violet or red tint, and unfortunately there is nothing you can do to adjust the color. With these cameras they do have IR for night vision, however with the 12 LEDs installed you will get around 10ft of vision unless you have lighting around the area\". ...End Quote.So longer story short, the Zmodo support person and I have exchanged more E-mail's and it has come down to that if I want a better camera I will need to send back ALL my 8 cameras and will also need to pay more money for better cameras...........................................................................ZMODO DVR MODEL# DVR-H9108-500GB PROBLEMS..........On Aug. 1, 2012, I had the system fully installed and running 24/7....NO problems with the DVR, no problems with interference on the cameras.On Aug. 10, 2012, In EARLY morning the DVR was working and recording just fine.LATE morning I check the DVR, turned on my monitor and got a surprise I was not expecting.On the 8 (eight) camera system showing on the monitor, I now have 5 (five) camera box's on the monitor showing my \"channel 8\" camera shot. And 4 of the 5 are flashing, and in 3 other box's I have \"channel 1\" flashing. So in other words, the monitor for the 8 cameras is showing multiple camera shots from 1 camera. And at times I will have 5 shots of 1 camera and 3 shots of 1 camera all at the same time and flashing like strobe lights.Same day, Aug. 10, 2012, I called the phone number for Zmodo Support.Longer story short, Support had me reset the DVR back to factory default.This did NOT work. They had me send a video clip to them via e-mail of the DVR and what it was doing.Support called me back after about 30 minutes and said, Quote: \"It must be some kind of electrical interference\".  ... End Quote. I told them how can it be that when ALL my BNC cables are away from any electrical wiring and if that was the case, this problem would of started happening the very first day I had the DVR running. They then asked me if I had the \"BNC Cables\" next to each other and that could be the problem. WHAT, REALLY ???????I told him NO, BNC cables next to each other will not cause interference and told them it's a DVR problem and it could be something like the video processor. He then said that they will just do a \"warranty\" on the DVR and they will send a shipping label Via E-mail.Then told me that I need to send the DVR back to them and they will send a new DVR to me. I told them I do not want to be without a security system. So I was told that I can pay for a NEW DVR and they will send it out on Monday Aug. 13 and should arrive by Aug. 15....After they receive the BAD DVR, they will not charge my credit card...............................................................................So as of today Aug. 12, 2012, I had a working DVR that lasted for 9 (nine) daysand now I need to wait for a new DVR to arrive.As for the cameras,  the cameras that come with this system are JUNK.NOTE: I was asked if I would like to just return the entire system for a refund.I said, after spending over 20 hours, lots of $ for more BNC cables, making custom outside box's, wiring up over 544 ft. of BNC cable and at times working in an attic that was over 120 degrees, I would say that is out of the question on returning the entire system...................................

L. Holder", "ReviewID": "R3NCCCHHYP3Z7X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I tested the whole package, including all 8 cameras, as soon as it arrived. The DVR I got with the kit had already been in service somewhere, as there was none of the original packaging or protective plactics, the rubber feet had already been installed and the default IP address had been changed. Since it all worked, I didn't worry too much about it, even so I did contact customer support about it and the fact that I could not find the \"9 port power supply\" for the cameras. Late on, I found what passes for the \"9 port power supply\" (it is a cable with one power in and 9 power out that attaches to a second power block) and contacted them again to let them know. The responce from customer support made it clear that there is a language barrier somewhere. They decided to send me a second power cable assembly, but no mention of the previously used state of the unit. It all works and is under warranty, so I'm not too concerned.The good: Fairly easy setup. All 8 cameras functioned well, with identical quality of image. Overall image quality is good, though a tiny bit fuzzy (may need to clean the lens covers). It appears to have all the features that other DVR's have (scheduler, motion detection, etc.)The lacking: Documentation is a bit thin (literally and figuratively), especially when it comes to the web interface portion. In order to access the web interface, you have to hobble your browser's security. I did not find that very comforting. The fold-up quick reference has text that is almost impossible to read, due to being too small and being such a light shade of grey that it is almost invisible.The sort of bad: By default, it seems that it is recording on all 8 channels continuously, whether there is a camera attached or not. It took quite a few tries to get it to stop recording and to get it to behave the way I wanted it to (motion only). The BNC connectors are VERY tightly packed, making it difficult to attach to them without a tool.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy to set up, but bad cameras and software", "Author": "Huckleberry", "ReviewID": "R1AQQ7MFUKLEVP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Set up is about the same as a DVD player and only takes a few minutes (not including running the wires and placing cameras) but the software is horrible.I changed the resolution to max and apparently that didn't work with my monitor, but rather than giving me a message to approve or change the setting the screen just went black.  The unit has no hard reset so I spent an hour on hold for customer support that walked me through navigating the menu blindly using the arrow keys.Once I did actually get to a person he was very helpful and helped me set up the remote viewing using my Droid phone using the ASee app..Bottom line is you get what you pay for with this unit, and honestly none of the software I've used on these types of units is ever any good.The real test of time will be how long the cameras last since my Swann cameras lasted exactly 30 days past the warranty of 1 year.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT", "Author": "Gabriel", "ReviewID": "R25HH2Y51NDDZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "They were very helpful with all my concerns.
