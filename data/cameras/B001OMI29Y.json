{"Reviews": [{"Title": "With the CORRECT Battery, a Fantastic Little Camera...", "Author": "Mercedes L. Johnmeyer", "ReviewID": "RSXX27ITTRAF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the Kodak Z712 for the past couple years and LOVE it. However for vacations, it was a bit bulkier then I liked. I didn't want to downsize from a 12X zoom to a 3X, so I just continued using it till something else caught my attention. Enter the Z1485. An AWESOME little camera.I received the camera in mid-December. I used the battery that came with it, a non-rechargeable KLIC-8000 Li-Ion. It lasted about a month, all through Christmas (during which I took MANY pictures) and regular daily pics (I have an 11 month old, so I take a lot!). I just changed the battery a few days ago to a rechargeable KLIC-8000 Li-Ion. If you purchase this camera, MAKE SURE you buy the correct battery for it. Of course it's going to suck up regular AA batteries, it's a powerful little point and shoot.The picture clarity is fantastic (keep in mind, I'm just a casual picture taker. Day-to-day pics of my son, and family trips). All the pics I've downloaded to my Kodak program and printed out have come out beautifully. I normally use the smart-scene, but sometimes (like during Christmas) I use other settings, like the candle light setting for pics of the Christmas tree. They came out perfect, all nice and soft. The size of the camera itself is perfect...I actually bought an ipod jogging case for it so I can wear it around my wrist or arm during vacations (nice to always have the camera handy), and it fit just fine.I've always used Kodak for their simple no-brainer approach to picture taking, and this camera fits that to a tee. I'm so glad I upgraded. I'll always love my Z712, but this little guy has everything I need. PLEASE do not be dissuaded by the mediocre reviews here. Most people know NOT to put regular AA batteries in a digital camera. It sucks the life out of them in no time. With the proper batteries, this camera is light, clear, and does an all around GREAT job!", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "OK camera, not what I was hoping for.", "Author": "starsirius \"starsirius\"", "ReviewID": "R254XI8GR9ZRNB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I found this camera for a price that made it worthwhile to try. And I tried it. I wouldn't say it was disappointing, but definitely not what I wanted. I am very much a point & shoot type of photographer--as you'll see in my limited lingo below.My findings:Pros:Smart capture is a nice feature that automatically determines the best settings for whatever you're trying to take a picture of. (Great for point & shoot types).Button placement is pretty intuitive.Cons:There is no viewfinder. This is of course a preference thing, but I found it hard for taking pictures in direct sunlight and in night shots (high amount of pixelation and streaking on screen).The USB cord was very flimsy and easily damaged.In many reviews I've read, there are a lot of complaints about the battery life. My only issue about the batteries is that after about 40 shots, the start-up and lag time between shots increased significantly--many missed opportunities.Most of my night shots came out blurry, even though the camera was on a steady surface. Close-up night shots came out highly pixelated.Face capture never worked (although this might be user error).", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Clarity", "Author": "K. Kersten", "ReviewID": "R22O9UWZ61YSGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having been an adrenalin filled amateur photographer I have used Kodak camera C330, C813 and Z1275 for the last several years taking pictures deep within caves; while rock climbing or white-water rafting. I am really impressed by the pictures that the Kodak Z1485IS is producing. The pictures are stunning; sharp, and contain an amazing amount of detail.  The first day I took a sample pictures of flowers and found an insect on them; it looked like a nature magazine picture!  Every picture seems to look fantastic when  I use the auto select snap and shoot mode.The HD video is fantastic; although many computers have a hard time playing it because of the huge file size. This video is not shaky like the first generation Kodak Z1275 which was just not ready for prime time. You can even zoom in while shooting video.Getting this camera and seeing the great photos may make you feel like a professional. Buttons and settings are very natural and easy to use for a point and shoot. You will be tempted to shoot a lot of pictures and video. Unfortunately; do to the huge file size of video do not expect to be able to share it. A 64 second 720 HD video of horses was 107 megabytes. Sharing large picture files (14mp=2-8megs) can be difficult too. I upgraded my subscription smugmug photosharing site to be able to share the HD video.Sample pics... [...]Running on Lithium AA batteries was essential for me as I frequently am in extreme environments -like caves- where I cannot put the camera on a charger. If you use alkaline batteries in a pinch only expect 30 minutes of operation. Energizer Ultimate Lithium gives about 2-4 hours on a $5 a set.I am preparing to depart on an overseas trip and am really excited to be taking the Kodak 1485IS camera with me. It is easy to use; takes great pictures and mind blowing video. I think Kodak nailed the right combination of features with this one.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I expected from my Kodak", "Author": "kdea473", "ReviewID": "R3MCPHSE7RMUU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a Kodak 6 MP camera that bit the dust on a recent vacation (user error, no fault of the camera!).  I spent several weeks researching cameras, going to every store to hold them in my hands, and ended up buying this gem from Amazon.I have been very pleased with the picture quality both indoors and out.  I am especially impressed with the photo quality in low light (considerably less noise than I have ever experienced in a digital camera).  The focus is great, and moves right along with my subjects.The video is nice, though definitely not why I bought the camera.  It is very smooth and works well even in low light.  I have had no problems with the battery holding a charge.My biggest complaint (which I knew when I was buying the camera) is the lack of optical viewfinder.  It was nearly impossible for me to find a camera with one, and I would have had to give up other features to get it.All in all, I am very pleased with this Kodak camera.  It is my third Kodak digital camera (a 4 MP, a 6 MP, and now this one) and definitely the best.  The price was also fabulous, especially compared with what features rival camera manufacturers offer at this price point.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Most bang for your buck.", "Author": "Kenneth M. Fagan \"[Hou*]Ammanon\"", "ReviewID": "R29Z9XYFSD45YN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little weary at first about buying a camera that claims 14.2 megapixels for this price.  But let me tell you, this is an amazing little camera that takes phenomenol pictures and video.  Recently my house took on about 4 inches of water due to a freak storm.  I was able to take a picture through a whole in the ceiling of a 1/2\" water pipe that was leaking.  The picture came out flawless.  No ordinary camera could do that.  This camera has a multitude of features for any lighting conditions. With my misfortune at the house I have used pretty much every one of them.  The panoramic feature is very cool also.  I do believe that is my favorite setting.  At the Kemah waterfront (Kemah Texas), all my photos came out very sharp. The color was amazing and crisp.  I will warn against what type of memory chip you purchase for this camera.  I wanted to stay with Kodak but they did not seem to offer what I wanted.  I ultimatley went with a Sandisk product. 16 gig HD Video.  I can put almost 4000 14.2 megapixel pictures on it.  I can also take 2 hours of 760p video.  This memory card was a good price for what you get.  All in all, Amazon gets 5 stars, Beach Camera gets 5 stars, and Sandisk gets 5 stars. I am very pleased with my purchase and would not change anything.side note, the Sandisk card will hold over 9000 pictures set at 5 megapixels.

I read & read - much of it here on Amazon. I'm shy of professional reviews (which can be overly into high end stuff) I like the reviews here on Amazon alot.One of the biggest gripes I've seen here have been related to power issues. Yes You Must use Lithium Batteries or you're gonna be Disappointed. Its Twenty-0-9  get yer darn lithiums and move forward. Amazon has great deals on the lithium batteries - they're the Kodak KLIC-8000 style but the generic ones work quite well.One of the things about it nearly being 2010 is small is the way things are. I like the fact that I can easily carry my Z1485 in my pocket. Thing is, I hate the way most of these cameras give you nothing to hold onto. Grabbing cameras at local retailers I found most of them all too easy to drop. That was the first thing I liked about the Z1485. That bit of a bulge with that rubbery strip makes it far easier to hold than most cameras in this class. The on screen little let you know what mode you just went into is handy too. A true view finder sure would be preferable but the screen works okay.Then I seemed to recall that Kodak had slipped in to an abyss of poor quality and lack of keeping up with current technology. I went back and started doing some research and found that they had done a come back and were back as being a maker of `good bang for the buck' cameras.I found that it had both the point & shoot for my hunny and multiple program modes for myself. We do alot of photography at night club shows - difficult and generally dim lighting, performers moving, dancing, and so on. The relatively large CCD helps the Z1485 handle poor lighting.  Ricky likes the 'smart capture' features and gets plenty of good shots. The optical image stabilization is awesome!The first pics I took with it were done by setting it to smart capture in a dim bar with awful lighting. I shook the camera like a can of spray paint and hit the shutter button repeatedly trying to get blur, backlighting, and whatever other intentionally bad situations to see what I'd get for results. What I got was a bunch of pretty good pictures of things I didn't care about. I was amazed at how well the Z1485 did with me trying to get bad pix. Of course when trying for good pix they're oft pretty good. Using the program modes is even better (for those of us so inclined)We give it two thumbs up. heres a little thing on the smart capture feature -  [...]", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "this camera is amazing", "Author": "C.

That's when I discovered this 14mp camera and I suddenly NEEDED it so bad. I've never seen a 14MP camera, especially for under $200!. Still, I thought really hard before buying this camera. Even though it has some great reviews there were some people that insisted it took horrible pictures. SERIOUSLY?! I couldnt take a horrible picture with this camera if I tried! I bought it on ebay last week for [...] bucks (I KNOW!! :) ).So far i've taken really great pictures with it. Im still trying out all the settings because there are so many and I want to experiment which ones work best with certain lighting. Im so glad I didnt listen to the bad reviews. I'm not sure if people realize that you have to hold down the shutter button half way and the camera will let you know when to take the picture (the frame will turn green). This takes less than a second but the results are great. Before you post a review saying youre getting blurry or bad pictures, make sure you are using the right setting.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great digi cam, but Li Ion batteries are a MUST!", "Author": "2thMan", "ReviewID": "RLHH1KLHZJ9IR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, excellent digital camera! Only \"cons\" discovered were that any power source other than rechargable Lithium Ion batteries are impractical.  This little powerhouse of a camera gobbles up other batteries like a wood chipper!  Also, I've found that you must be in the auto mode to get to macro program.  You cannot select Macro from the dial.  I did experience difficulty trying to take a macro photo where the camera oscilated between auto and macro.  Many macro shots  were out of focus because of this.  This was a minor issue, though.

They expect you to charge it off your computer or buy the charger separately. I find that this is a rather cheap way to make you buy another one of their products: everyone knows that a computer is not necessarily always available.2) The photographs that it produced were grainy when blown up, which is not particularly favorable when you're trying to crop images for websites or posters.3) The time it took to refresh after taking a photo was kind of long.4) It fell flat on the floor in action shots.Overall, this would be a good spare camera, but I wouldn't recommend it as a main camera unless all you want to do is take photos of your kid's birthday party.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice camera for the casual photog", "Author": "Vincent Abrams", "ReviewID": "R2W0MZOS1S2SKW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took it down to Florida for a few days and took some really great pics with it.  They were all clear no matter what conditions under which they were taken.  My girlfriend had more fun with it than I did, taking all sorts of different photos and some video, for which you do need a memory card. I was able to get an 8MG card for $14 from Amazon.  I like the color and the compactness of it.  My only concern is that it's not the thinnest camera you can buy. It's almost 1.5 inches at it's thickest.  I got a case for it, again from Amazon, and it fits perfectly, and I have room for an extra card and batteries. Speaking of which, it would have been nice if it had come with a charger, since it's got rechargeable batteries.

I put it in my back pocket most days and get some great shots with ease.  If you would like to make a great little view finder for it, I suggest purchasing a nine dollar accessory that makes it easy to use it in bright sunlight (Any camera  LCD screen is a problem in bright light without a hood)  Get a Pana-Vue 3 Slide Viewer and just remove the frosted plastic, then put it over the screen - For one more step up add a nine dollar Kalt eyecup NPECCA for Canon by stretching over the magnifier end and Voila, for eighteen bucks you've got a viewfinder that allows you to press your eye up to the camera and also helps stabilize for better shots/composition.  Now you can set the viewscreen to powersaver mode and get better battery life too.  This little unobtrusive gem of a camera fits into a back pocket, takes excellent pics, does panorama stitch in a few seconds like magic, HD video, easy to use, can be adjusted manually if you like.  Order an aftermarket klic 8000 equivalent automatic charger and two or three aftermarket lithium batteries - and read the directions for charging carefully - you will have all you need for many hours of daily shooting and wonderful fun memories.  But you still have to do SOME work to compose your shots and not hold your Z1485 like Beavis and Butthead loaded up on chocolate donuts and Red Bull!  Today's Mindfulness Tip: Cameras will only work for you if you focus yourself first.  The other cameras in this technology class that I looked at were easily 3x as much money and had poor ergonomics.

The optics, functions, and controls were very good, but for a camera of this price you would think that Kodak would include a rechargable battery system as a standard part of the package. In order to have a decent rechargable battery which supplies a decent number of pictures per charge, you must pay at least another $30 and order a charger and a Kodak rechargable lithium ion battery.  By that time I would have paid $205 so I returned the camera and bought a nice Cannon 1200 IS. There are many good quality cameras in the same class which come standard with all of this included and will not cost over $170 delivered.  Kodak is too interested in making extra profit on optional batteries at an increased cost.  To accept anything less than a rechargable battery will cost a fortune for regular alkaline batteries.

Happy customers are less likely to take the time, especially if they received the item as a gift.That last part applies to me.  This review is different than some in that I didn't buy the device myself on here (although the gifter did) and I really am happy overall with it.  I am 40, a guy, and have always had an easy time figuring out new electronics items without reading a single page of the manual.  Kodak actually makes this easy because they haven't changed vastly the way their cameras work since they started making digital ones.They have improved upon them from my last generation owned, a five megapixel.  They now put a dedicated on/off button on them, which is nicer.  The number of dedicated modes for taking various types of pictures has increased drastically (including a \"fireworks\" mode, which I find weird and useless, but I'm sure some will like).Of the few negative comments I have about this device, the biggest by far is it ONLY taking lithium batteries.  Anybody who was excited or in a hurry could have easily shoved a set of alkaline batteries in it and ruined it.  It does come with a single use lithium battery, thankfully, but it's not the rechargeable kind (which is sold separately).  If it requires a lithium battery, devices shouldn't be physically capable of taking AA alkaline!  I haven't the camera long enough to know how long the battery that comes with it will last.Another negative is Kodak's EasyShare system.  Let's be honest here, it's nothing more than a poorly disguised store-front for them to sell products.  That's fine, but they need to just admit that and stop acting like they're giving us some great software.  The EasyShare software has never been great.  Version 7.1 came with my camera, but I have Windows 7 and had to download a later version (8.2).  It's function to look online for a later version doesn't work, nor does the link it gives for \"more information.\"Anyway, in summary, this is an awesome little camera for the money!  Just be careful you don't put standard alkaline batteries in it, and go cautiously giving Kodak your personal info through the EasyShare software.  I recommend you don't even create an account with them.  They are a bit annoying.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Picture taking made easy", "Author": "Joe W.

This camera is ready to make its journey back to the dealer.Pros:1. Very portable.2. Takes AA batteries which makes it easy while travelling.3. Picture quality is generally good. Pictures in bright sunlight turns out really good. The other cameras that I tried before produces darker subjects when shot against a bright background.4. Smart Capture does ok and the camera comes with about 16 or so preset modes.Cons:1. The camera feels very delicate in your hand. At times, I was worried of scratching it while in my pocket or breaking the battery compartment accediently.2. The lens wobbles. The two sections of the lens touches each other when the camera is on and if you were to tilt it.3. Battery life is just not acceptable. I tried with 6 different kinds of batteries both lithium and NIMH high capacity batteries. They all died  after taking just 10- 15 pictures. The same set of batteries lasts a long long time in my canon S2is.4. Lag between shots is not acceptable as well. Both in smart mode and any scene mode the camera takes a good 6 to 7 seconds between shots. So you cannot go clicking snaps and this is very very irritating.5. If the battery dies, the camera gets stuck with the lens in the open position. This almost got me big time and luckly I had a set of charged batteries.6. The camera failed to read my new kingston 8gb card couple of times and I had to power it down and turn it on again to make it read the card again. All along it kept saying \" Unable to read the card. Please replace your memory card\". I got this card brand new from fry's an hour ago.7. The software that comes with the camera is a piece of junk. It doesn't let you store the pictures in a custom folder of your choice. It dumps them in the documents and setting/.../ folder.If you can put with up with its extremely high battery consumption  and if you can put up with its 5-6 seconds time between snaps and if you can take a chance with its delicate construction and unreliable hardware then go for it.I highly recommend to look at alternatives and don't let the 14mp \"buzz word\" trip you. We hardly need more than 6mp for regular photography and regular prints (unless you want to blow them up to super huge prints which is very unlikely for 95% of the users)Update 08/02/2009I ended up buying a panasonic DMC-LZ8k(Black) for lot less (Paid 99$) than Z1485 and I'm really happy with it's performance. I used the same set of batteries that I used with the Kodak z1485 and got hundreds of pictures without any problem. Lag between shots is minimal, camera feels really stong and reliable. IA mode works well in most of the situations, Low light performance is accetable, has full manual controls, bigger LCD. Have not seem any serious flaws with the camera so far.I'm planning to give this camera to my dad and get a panasonic DMC-ZS3 as soon as the prices drop a little bit which should happen in the next month or two.

We were looking for it because one was dropped (constructions quality is good, but not good enough to withstand butter fingers) and we like the camera enough to replace like for like instead of going with something new. It was pretty easy to figure out and the view screen is a nice size. A couple of negatives are that it doesn't have a viewfinder, just the view screen which is next to impossible to see outside in the daytime. It is also slow between shots, so if you are trying to capture something quickly and miss it with the first one, it will be gone by the time the camera resets for the next picture.

I struggled through this for a couple of months, and finally sent it in to get it fixed.  It worked ok for a while after that, but then I noticed that the battery was dead every time I needed to use the camera.  in order to preserve the life of the batteries, I ended up having to take the battery out in between each use.  This has become a hassle as well.  A few months ago, I noticed that the camera started dropping the last picture I took.

I bought it primarily for two reasons.  For the 14.1 mega-pixels (to take good, detailed photos of my artwork) and for the HD video possibilities (videos for YouTube).My main complaint is that in the product description it says the video format is either .mov or .mpeg.  I'm fairly good with gadgets and techno things and I could never find how to switch the format to .mpeg, so that you can edit your videos using Windows Movie Maker (which is my favorite method of editing, simply because it's fast, easy & what I was use to).SO, I ended up calling Kodak customer service and  it was based out of India [complaint #2].  This was extremely frustrating, because although basic communication was possible...there are nuances in language that only someone from your country can understand.  If it were an American on the line, we would have understood each other much more easily and although I probably would have been equally frustrated, I would have felt like at least I was able to get my point across.  That experience was nothing short of torture, only to find out that all Kodak cameras produce only the .mov format.So I ended up having to get another video editor, learn how to use it, etc. If you have a good computer that is not clogged up with programs,etc...you'll be able to easily handle the huge memory that the HD videos have, but because my computer is older, I record my videos in 640x480 HQ and they're equally as good (and much faster to edit).The photo qualities are obviously very good, even at the 5.0 mp format (which is what I typically use for everyday photos).  You have the choice of several formats (which is nice): 2.4, 2.8, 3.1, 3.8, 4.5, 5.0. 10.7, 12.6 and 14.2 megapixels, so you can adjust the file size, depending on what your needs are.There are a lot of advanced features on this camera that I have either yet to use, or don't really have a need for (exposure, aperture, etc.), so I cannot comment much on those, other than to say that I think this camera would be fun for the very amateur, to the professional photographer. For the amateur, the \"scene\" choices for the auto setting are nice and easy. The settings are: portrait, sport, landscape (distance), night portrait, night landscape, snow, beach, text for documents), fireworks, flower (this is the macro setting), museum, self-portrait, stage, backlight, candle light & sunset.  And they have a quick description on the screen of what each is for.What else...The 5x zoom leaves much to be desired, as it really doesn't make much of a difference.I highly recommend buying the Kodak Digital Camera Battery (3.7v)- It's a re-chargable Li-Ion battery (KLIC-8000).  If you can afford to get two, even better...that way you always have a battery on hand.  I feel the charge lasts a long time on this battery, but can't give you an exact time (check out other reviews for the battery).So, overall, I like this camera and would never have considered returning it, despite the fact that I got it primarily to make videos (with the bonus feature of high mega pixels for photos) and I couldn't edit them using my favorite video editor.  I will be getting a camcorder soon and will leave this camera just for my detailed photos.I hope this was helpful.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Fair Camera on Auto, a Better Camera in Program Mode.", "Author": "ESRick \"Richard\"", "ReviewID": "R3KJPL9XCZRUG5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera since early December 2009.  At first I didn't really like it.  Most of the pictures had a reddish cast to them when I used the fully automatic setting with Perfect Touch.  I started using Program Mode and setting the ISO to 80, with the rest set to Auto, unless it was for a closeup.  Then I used either the Flower symbol, or Manual Focus.  My pictures were now coming out very good, and sometimes spectacular for such a small camera.  The sensor in this camera is much bigger than most point and shoots, so it does low light photography without a flash pretty well with the proper settings.  The camera rarely blows out the highlights and has very good dynamic range handling (bright and darker areas in the same image).  And you can always adjust the exposure a little to compensate, but I never seem to have to use that feature.The only real problem I have had with the camera has been some difficultly seeing the LCD outside in bright light.  I can see the outline of what I am shooting, but no details, so it is a bit of hit or miss as to whether I got a good shot or not.  Of course most cameras without a dedicated viewfinder are similar in this regard, but a lot of them do have much brighter screens, or more than two brightness settings.Another potential problem is with the camera eating batteries, but I bought two rechargeable L-Ion batteries and a charger at the same time I bought the camera and have had no problems.  I always carry the spare battery with me when taking pictures.  The camera slows down considerably as the battery runs down, but not using the Auto Perfect Touch makes a big difference in the time it takes for the camera to process the image between shots and how long your battery lasts.  And you can always add Perfect Touch processing to a picture while it is still in the camera if it needs some contrast or brightness adjustment like with a face being too dark with a bright background.Overall, this is a nice little camera for the price.  It has full manual controls available, a few manual controls if that's all you want, or a fairly good Auto Mode.  Using Program Mode with everything on auto turns off the Perfect Touch and speeds up the camera and makes your battery last longer.  For me, my pictures seem to turn out better in this mode.This camera is basically a poor mans Canon G10 with the same size 1/1.7 inch sensor, 14.7 mega pixels, and similar 28-140mm 5X optical zoom lens for one third of the price.  But like the Canon G10, only if you take the time learn to use it properly in something other than Auto will it give you the best results.  I got mine for $99 new, so I am way ahead of the game  The Kodak case, off brand batteries and charger cost an additional $35 or so and were all well worth it.

I had a couple of opportunities to field test my purchase and then hit a figurative brick wall. The view screen stopped working and I was shooting in the dark because that's what the result was when I depressed the shutter. The camera was never dropped, kicked, spindled, mutilated or exposed to water. Even when attached to a PC - nothing. Any previously taken photographs could be reviewed downloaded, etc.Reader's Digest version of subsequent events - surgery was performed(yes I voided any warranty anywhere in that act) and  - IT'S ALIVE -again. The only issue I can confidently comment on is that that a set of three wires (white, red, green) above and to the left of the lens module may of been the culprit. The white and red wire solder points were shorting each other. Once seperated the camera functions as normal.Would I purchase this product again? I believe that, for me, it's too early to tell.

It has very little documentation in the manual and only provides you with basic info that you will figure out on your own. The extensive manual is online but that is really a specs guide, not a How to or Best Practices by any means. This is a very easy camera, takes great shots and has corrected all of the issues I have had with taking pictures. Sunlight streaming in from the windows, backlit photos, dark rooms - all auto fixed - no problem. Just know that included in the price you will need to purchase a battery, docking station (optional but it will charge the battery and make life easy on the upload of pics), install software (easyshare and Quicktime as video is .mov only), a camera bag, hd docking station if you want and a sdhc memory card if you don't already have one. But most cameras will require the same things.Two issues I had with this camera were the video - this was my first experience with HD video so anyone like me that is new to this I hope this helps. I didn't realize that my laptop which works great is officially out of date on the RAM. I took the video in HD mode but then on playback the audio was consistent but the picture froze up and was choppy, a little grainy as well. I bought a new memory card since the one I used was standard SD and old, I contacted Support (took forever to figure it out and couldn't offer me a workaround). Support told me to download the latest software which I had, then told me my video card couldn't support it. Close, I don't have enough RAM in my laptop or in my new netbook or in my husband's laptop. Apparently all my computers are now out of date for this purpose. This was so frustrating. The support person told me to change the video quality and lower it. So I changed it to 640/480 same issue. I changed it to the lowest setting and that works. I used my work computer to verify the other two settings did work. All 3 video settings are very good quality. The only grainy pic was the HD but I believe that is my computer as the screen in quicktime was larger in that mode and it couldn't support it. Much better than my old Sony Cybershot 7.2mp or even my regular video camera.The other issue I had was installing their software on my laptop. I went through support and over and over again uninstalling and reinstalling. I still have not been able to install on one of my computers. I literally spent the last 2 days working on this camera and trying to figure out the software and the video. I was very close to returning but impressed with the still shots and easy of use that I was determined to make sure this was a bad camera before returning. Besides for the price I absolutely could not find another one comparable.It would be nice to have more of an optical zoom on it since this is 5x and some of the others are 10x but for the price again I'm fine with it. It has met my needs for zooming so far too so it is definitely a keeper.My next step is to figure out how to burn a dvd, upload video to someplace I can watch it or maybe upgrade my ram. I'd like to find a work around though because my laptop still meets my needs with this exception but not sure I want to spend money on RAM and I'd like to take advantage of the HD quality.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "lji", "ReviewID": "RRLAVFOL56YHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already have one, I purchased this one for my son as a gift!

I used the auto setting in low lighting, and because it automatically applies the Perfect Touch technology on this setting, it over-corrected the lighting and left pictures grainy. Even the high ISO setting performed poorly in low-lighting, leaving a lot of noise in the pictures. Manual settings with flash could not produce enough lighting to get anything other than too-dark pictures. I also took indoor pictures in optimal lighting and all the dark colors in the picture had tons of noise. Skin tones look washed out indoor as well.I tested out the camera outdoors as well, taking pictures of fall foliage. Colors were muted, and image never came out crisp. I blame this on the lens - it is sub-par, whereas my old Easyshare has a Schneider-Kreuznach glass lens which produced extremely crisp pictures.I would advise against buying this camera, even if you only casually take pictures.

My reasoning for having placed my order, was because of the outstanding reputation Kodak has.Placed my order with amazon and item was shipped by All Pro Sports Cards out of Middletown, Ohio. Item arrived in a timely manner. Packaging seemed to be rather good. Opened said package and only found the camera itself with nothing else included. I was under the impression, this was a rebuilt item and it included everything stated within the advertisement. ONLY item included, was a pair of AA batteries. Lesson learned, don't place a order for a used/rebuilt item! Just in case your wondering? This lesson cost me 144 bucks.Upon inspection, found this camera to have been heavily used. (Scratches and heavy wear marks.) My first impression, was that my order came from a pawn shop. Contacted seller and he had stated this was a used item. And that, he included a sim card. Sorry to say, this camera had no sim card installed nor was one, located within said packaging. I had the impression he didn't believe me, but he did say, he'd mail one out at the soonest. Asked if his place of business was a pawn shop and he stated, no that it wasn't and it was a Sports Card business. Google maps, (Street view.) said otherwise. No matter what you call a rose, it still smells the same.The item itself, works as expected. Did find that it will eat a set of new batteries, in just a matter of a few short minutes. Install rechargeable batteries, and they will only last but a few short seconds. I highly do recommend that you use nothing but Lithium or like batteries to power this unit.The camera is very easy to use and online help was outstanding. This is a great little camera to keep with you, for them unexpected moments. Overall quality of images, was good. What little video I was able to take, was good and the sound quality, was also good.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2BBQSEPFAEH30", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First of all, let me say that this is at least my 6th digital camera, so I have been using them since the early days... My last camera was a Kodak 1285 which I returned immediately due mainly to slow/poor focusing. I decided to give this one a chance, because I read a lot of reviews saying how all the problems they had with the 1285 were fixed on this camera. Not true! Unfortunately, I can't return it, as I bought it from an Amazon 3rd party.Where to begin,1. First of all the battery life is HORRIBLE! A pair of AA batteries lasts, without exaggeration, about 12 pictures (without a flash)! Or even less with a flash. Every time I use it I have to bring 10 AAs with me. I have tried everything from the cheapest to the most expensive batteries, without much difference in # of photos. The supplied Lithium-Ion battery lasted about 20 pictures! At this point, I don't want to invest more money in this camera by buying a charger/rechargeables.2. Any motion pictures under anything but perfect lighting are blurred, no matter whether it is in auto or scene modes.3. Very slow save time and very slow response time (shutter lag) I have missed so many shots it's ridiculous.4. Shuts off for no reason at all, even with new batteries. This is not a auto-shut-off feature, as it will shut off with the lens still extended.5. Good pictures when it actually worksI will never buy another Kodak camera.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent still camera, reliable...", "Author": "Paul M.

Not having read more information than included here \"HD video features - Capture HD quality video. Capture more video while using less memory with MPEG-4\".  What that translates into is (our product records in Apples \".mov\" format-indeed a fine video compression method).  This means that I purchased, as stated, an excellent still camera.  The videos are very good, but:  They can be uploaded to the computer, transfered on disk...  as anything but convert them into a useable format for editing or recording on coventional video devices (MPEG-4). This is the product as delivered; true the basic Quicktime program is free, but that does no more than stated.  To produce usefull videos, one must activate Quicktime Pro (the current outlay being just under US$30 - which must then be done again when Apples regular upgrades are downloaded and installed).  Over the lifetime of the camera, which is extremely long -  Each basic battery for my camcorder costs a bit more, is rechargable, lasts 10 years in regular rotation - and the camcorder records MPEG4 on standard disks.  Ah, it's a bit bulky - but 2 hours of useable video in an easilly edited, converted and played format?  Why not.  Please - Apple, and those cameras using their format will claim that Quicktime is \"the\" industry standard.  Flat out, it's an excellent still camera.  Please expect compounded expenses over time if one does any more than record video or upload it to a video service that convert \".mov\" files into a more common format for distribution.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Michelle Ing", "ReviewID": "R1D1MCYABTXJXK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera is good but one thing is that it is a different color than what was on the description.  i wanted a blue camera and that is what I ordered..

Bought two of them; one for me and one as a gift for Christmas.  The blown up pictures they showed looked vivid and sharp.  What they don't tell you is that this camera eats up batteries big time.  It takes two AA batteries and they last about 10 - 20 minutes (Alkaline), depending on how many pics you take and if you're zooming in and out.  Definitely not the camera I want to take on vacation. I'd be spending 20% of my time changing batteries.  And about the 14 Megapixels; if you're not going to blow up pictures any larger than 8\" x 10\", anything over 3 megs is a waste.  You can get many 5 meg cameras (and even higher) for around the same price and you can be sure the batteries will last 10 or more times longer than this camera.  I haven't downloaded any pictures on the computer yet, but they do look really sharp and the colors are vivid on the camera.  It probably does take very good pictures, but having to change batteries all the time is costly and very frustrating when you're outside taking pictures of nature or sports, etc.  And again if you're not going to blow up your pictures, you are wasting your money on a 14 meg camera when a 5-8 meg camera will do the trick.  The more the megs, the shorter the battery life, rule of thumb.  I wish I would have done my homework and read the reviews before I bought, because I never would have bought this camera had I done so.One more thing.  I tried to view the pictures I took on our HDTV with the USB cable that comes with the camera and the TV read \"No Signal.\"  If you read the reviews, many people are saying the USB cord looks flimsy and easily damaged.  I haven't tried another cable yet, but I'd like to see the pictures from this camera on HDTV as I'm sure they should be sharp and clear.
