I've pulled 3 apart by accident when trying to fish them, even gently, through a concealed hole. If you're not going to hide the wire and surface mount them then you probably won't have any issues if you take care with the install.You're better off spending the little extra and using cat5 wire and baluns. Even if your not handy at crimping rj45 ends onto cat5 then buy a patch cord at the length you need. It serves the same purpose and you have a much more sturdy product in the end.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Did what it was suppose to.", "Author": "Bill Schebeck", "ReviewID": "RK4JWP3J7LGDV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not much to say.
