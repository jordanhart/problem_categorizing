We use rechargable Eneloop brand, they work well in digital cameras and hold their charge when stored.Negative pointsNo viewfinder, which makes it tough to see what you are taking in bright sunlight.No audio playback for video on the camera.  It does record the sound, but to hear it you have to download the video.A little slow between photos,  perhaps 5 seconds after a photo before it is ready to take another.  We are using a Kingston 2 GB SD Flash Memory Card, perhaps if you bought a faster card this might improve.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awsome easy to use camera", "Author": "Annette \"Annette\"", "ReviewID": "R36661S3YE4EIJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a first time mom, and as such, an easy to use camera is a must have.

It's a very cute camera, very user friendly and my niece was able to figure out all of its inner workings immediately. The pictures seem a little dark compared to other cameras.

I think it took excellent pictures, and a friend there begged me to sell it to them, so I did. But, I want to say, it was a great camera while I had it. I really liked the fact that I could put 2 AA batteries in it and not some battery pack that I had to charge. Just a matter of convenience, battery packs always die when you are somewhere without a spare or a way to recharge quickly.

I've been very pleased with this camera. I got to really test it out recently when my children and I went to the zoo. It's so easy to use and I love the image stabilization feature because with two kids in tow, it can be hard to take pictures that are not fuzzy. With this feature it's so much easier to get clear pictures. Also, when I purchased the camera it came with Kodak batteries, I was surprised how long they lasted. Mind you, I had been using the camera off and on to take pictures before we went to the zoo for six and a half hours and the batteries finally died after four hours of being there. After taking a ridiculous amount of pictures, 350 to be exact, the camera was on a lot. I did find turning it off whenever possible helps seemed to help with the life of the batteries.

Actually, I was in the process of sending the camera back when I read a review that mentioned the same thing so I took the camera back out and put the batteries in the other way and it works beautifully.  The slot shows the - and + at the top which made me think that is where it would be ...on the top side.  Instead, the mark is there to let you know that is the end that goes down into the camera.  So it was a little  confusing as I had never seen one marked that way before.We did not return the camera and we are very pleased.  The pictures are so crisp in detail.

Even contacted Kodak and they could offer no assistance. If you search online you could see that quite a few people had the same issue.
