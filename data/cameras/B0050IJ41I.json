{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DOES NOT WORK. EPIC FAIL.", "Author": "Amazoner \"Amazoner\"", "ReviewID": "R18R44VFKCJQ8V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Thought this was a good deal, turns out to be to good to be true. The seller never issued a tracking number for this item, so I missed the first delivery attempt. When I did receive this item and opened it up the product box was already opened. The product was advertised as being a NEW used item, but was not. It was a open box item that was return at least once before. The second problem was the security device did not record video or audio. The is a security product which did not work. The third problem was the device was supposed to be memory upgradeable from 16GB to 32GB it was not. It has an internal memory of 16GB that can not be upgraded as advertised. Hence this is why I returned this defective product. Returning the item for a full refund was another problem. I contacted the seller for a RMA number and ask for a full refund. They only gave me a partial refund. They decided that I would have to incur the original shipping cost of $9.79. Which is stupid because a majority of amazon product have free shipping over $25. I would never had to return the product in the first place if the product worked. I had to send a second email and get my credit card company involved for a complete payment. Be WARNED of using SMARTHOME as a seller.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0050IJ41I"}}
