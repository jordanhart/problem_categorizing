It is perfect for vacations and parties, and most other personal uses. This is not a camera for photo enthusiast requiring lots of options and lots of zoom capability. Overall, it is a great bargain.Pros:- Priced a significant amount lower than competing models- Very easy to use and intuitive menus- Great picture quality (not excellent)- Compact and solid, but not at the expense of usability- Usefull scene and picture framing toolsCons:- The batteries won't last more than twenty five pics w/flash- The LCD display is not so great in sunlight- The 3x optical zoom is only good enough for close objects and portrait shots (this is why it is not 5 stars)- The digital zoom seriously sacrifices image quality", "Date": "August 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Not a happy camper", "Author": "Imajica", "ReviewID": "R2YM879C0HF6E3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been using the Nikon 4100 for two months and have found it very difficult to use.  I use a camera for work, documenting defects in building construction.  The other two cameras I use are a Cannon Digital Rebel and an Olympus D-520.  To compare the group, lets get the good things out of the way first.  It is small and fits easily in a pocket.  It uses 2 AA batteries, so it is easy to get and carry spares.  The quality of the photos is what you would expect in a 4 MP camera.THE UGLY..the start up sequence for the 4100 seems at least twice as long as the Olympus.  Once on, the time between button push and actually taking a picture makes the camera difficult to use (even when photographing static components).  Frequently, it will not take a photo had you have to turn it off and back on (get a sandwich and take a break).  I have never used the camera for a full day when I did not have to turn it off and remove and reinstall the memory card because the camera \"lost\" the card. The buttons on the back are very sensitive, making the camera almost impossible to use with one hand.  When using it with one hand, you end up making sound recordings, movies, etc. There is more but this should give you the picture, no pun intended!", "Date": "October 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT CAMERA!!! Don't be swayed by negative comments", "Author": "Raven Joe \"omnicron3\"", "ReviewID": "R1V7NJ2SEE97MD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off let me say, how this excellent digital camera has got some bad reviews from people is \"Mind boggling!\"  One person remarks he has been using this camera for months and is difficult to use... The Nikon 4100 is a *Point and shoot* camera and it comes with a instructional video CD. The instructions are simple to read with clear diagrams. Among the his other comments as \"THE UGLY..the start up sequence for the 4100 (which I think is a cool animation with sound), long the 5 second flash recharge... and  STRANGER, \"having problems taking pictures in (even when photographing static components)\" What ever that is???. And \"Taking the memory in and out\" To I guess??? \"Start -er- up!\" Here's another \"Very poor focusing system, grainy pictures\" \"This camera is a mutt\"...Well I say \"BOOLA\" to you! *LOL shaking my head in mind boggling aw*As a Graphic Artist for 15 years I have seen the evolution of digital cameras threw the years. You want to talk about pixels and grain 8 years ago.. this camera is light years ahead in how it simplified,  point and shoot... with it clear and useful settings, eliminating the complex use of shutter speeds and Fstops, the Nikon 4100 does it for you. Read your manuel, trust the different screen modes in your events in taking pictures. There is even a Nikon friendly website ( [...] ) where you can share your pictures and information forum with other Coolpix users...find that with other digital camera name brands. The 4100  and the 3200 Coolpix are both identical as the only difference is the 1 extra megapixel  advantage with in the 4100, you won't be able to tell the difference. As an sworn Olympus user. I have found the 4100 takes very clear quality pictures and insignificant grain, indoors and out... I use it to produce pictures for cover illustrations at it's 300 dpi setting, up too 11X14 print size for use in the news paper print media and some hi gloss cover art. I am as picky as you get being artist and a stickler for detail. The flash does take 5 to 6 seconds to recharge but I'm in no hurry as it gives me time to think about my next shot...  unless your at some party in a drunken frenzy just snapping away which I might ad there is a stetting for that too... ( party mode) As I may remind you how many pictures your old 35 mm camera came out over flashed and over blurred or darker then space... Now you remember! Digital is here to save the day and so is Nikon.The 4100 and the 3200 Coolpix do need rechargeable batteries as the it's manufactured recommended (NiMH) batteries or CR-V3 lithium batteries... it is pointless to use Alkaline batteries in any digital camera using a built-in flash unit and view screen.Buy a large capacity SD card to store you  pictures at the highest setting / 4meg. I suggest  256 or better 512.This is not a movie camera so don't expect DVD quality movies... it makes movies at 15 frames a second at 640 x 480 pixels... get a video camera if ya want hi 8 movies. I did send a 15 sec holiday movie greeting to family, via internet and it did a good job... it's the thought in sound and picture that counts at this point not the VGA quality.If you need some more intelligent and constructive comments from novice or professional people just like you go to  [...]The Coolpix 4100 is a Nikon and lives up to the highest standards of it's company name. My only peeve is I wish it had a bigger screen and easy to see in bright sunlight. View my pictures and you be the judge as only you can decide if the coolpix is for you, not some strange and off the wall comments deciding for you. I give The Nikon Co. Kudos for developing a low price, hi quality in a small package, easy to use point and shoot digital camera.

Are there better more versatile, more feature loaded 4 MP cameras out there? Yes.  But at this price, this camera is hard to beat.I am a very experienced photographer with my 35mm SLR but the Nikon Coolpix 4100 is my first digital camera. I chose it for its simple graphic menus and ease of use. I wanted a point and shoot that was small and light to carry with me but not so thin and tiny that it cost $600 and was impossible to get a good grip on.  This camera is small but not tiny and has very nice ergonomics and is comfortable to hold without worry of dropping it.I do not agree with the negative comments and reviews about this camera. PC magazine gave it only a fair rating but Steve's Digicams and CDNET and a few other sites recommend it. So you may want to investigate more but it is my opinion that this is a good 4MP camera.  It is extremely simple to use and almost anyone should be able to take it out of the box, put it on auto mode and take very nice pictures with it.  My 8 year old son can operate it and take pictures with it, and that was another reason I chose this camera.  As for battery life, yes it eats alkalines-don't bother with them-  Get rechargables or a CRV-3 pack and battery life will be better than average or very good depending on how many flash pictures you take or how much reviewing you do.The scene modes are nice in that they will automatically adjust the cameras ISO speed, shutter, and aperture to challenging lighting situations, so that  you can take good shots in otherwise tough light.  The ones I have tried so far seem to work well.I have had this camera for several days now and I have been pleased with the results so far. I have run it through a series of tests and from what I can see it is a very cabable camera and the images are crisp, detailed and clear,  with nice true to life color.There are some weaknesses but for what it will be used for 90% of the time by 90% of people these are probably not major issues.  It does tend to have a little noise in the shadows and dark areas but I think most cameras in this price and size range do because of small sensors. It has a little trouble focusing in low light but all digitals do as far as I know. Colors in the blue violet range can be a bit off depending on the light conditions.  The flash is a little weak but if the subject is within 10 feet or so it does fine.It lacks manual control.  If you want the ability to adjust a whole lot of stuff that will probably make your pictures turn out worse than if you let the camera do it for you, then choose a different camera like the Canon A75 or A85.  The Nikon 4100  does let you adjust white balance, exposure compensation, and color options along with all the different scene modes.  I find I am experimenting with all of them. Advanced users may want more controls to experiment with than this camera offers but for a small, simple point and shoot that takes very good pictures it delivers.Is it perfect? NO. that is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. For ease of use it should get a 5 for sure.", "Date": "January 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "This camera will blow you away... seriously...", "Author": "Johnny Quest \"Dr. J\"", "ReviewID": "R8D4AEIGDBJLA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has been over a year now since I have bought this camera.  I had upgraded from the previous Nikon 4000 model (which was equally good, but did not have a sound function for movie mode capturing.) And about 800 plus pictures and 300 movie clips later, (Although I can't post some of the pictures I made with the camera here... since I didn't make the purchase through Amazon but another store) I still love the camera very much.  I have been through a lot with this camera.  From the get go, It's a great buy.  I recommend others buying a camera for the first time to get it.  Absolutely.  And I'll also post some helpful hints as to what to expect when buying this camera:Pros:1) Small enough to fit in your hand perfectly, (esp. with a person with small hands like me)2)Uses AA batteries... trust me, with two Duracell batteries in there, I get about and average of 140 pictures.  Its great.3)Takes great pictures (when I say great, believe ME... it takes some GREAT pictures).  And I also know too when shopping for a camera, its a pain in the behind, but it definetely helps if you know someone (like me) who has used the product EXTENSIVELY, and its fantastic.  Trust me when I have it went through extensive usage... I took possibly 800 pictures plus with it.  You really learn with time to really get to love this camera. I would love to share some pics that I have taken (but like mentioned the camera was not purchased on Amazon, and it's very comparable to pictures that could be taken with a 4,000 dollar professional digital camera.  And I'm still an amateur photographer.4)Those very handy scene modes... really great function when you learn to really know how to fully utilize them.  But remember, as with any new digital camera purchase, keep in mind there will absolutely be a learning curve, where you need to use the product and know what everything does until you fully max out the camera's true potential.5)It's pretty darn sturdy for a small camera.  It's true.  I dropped the camera on hard concrete, from about say oh 7 feet off the ground, and when I picked it up, I was almost in tears thinking I broke it.  But I turned it on, everything worked perfectly fine.  This camera is so awesome.Now the Cons:1) It's really hard to take pictures in low light situations.  For instance, the screen looks really dark, or very grainy. Like say taking some pictures at a Chili's restaurant or something like that.  You really have to work the camera to get some good pictures, and some times you won't get anything.  Expect that. But when you pull it off, oh man are those some good pictures.2) The movie mode. Again, in low light situations, its pretty grainy and doesn't understand the light flow around quite well.  But oh well, its not a camcorder or anything so I guess you shouldn't expect too much from it.  But in good lighting situations, it takes some good clips.3) The time it takes from picture to picture.  For this function, I need a higher end camera to get faster pictures yes I know, but its still pretty darn annoying to wait till the blinking red light on the viewfinder turns a solid green.  I missed some good shots waiting for it to finish saving.4)Digital zoom. That function is pretty much worthless. Every attempt at using the functions made 99% percent of my pictures look like junk, and thats WITH good light available.  Simply limit use to the 3x zoom available and you should be fine.5) And thats about all that I can think of at the moment. *whew***Final Word: This is a great camera for a beginner since its easy to use, and for intermediates also.  For professionals, probably not, due to many limitations it may have. (But its not meant for that reason anywho, so that doesn't count. It's a fantastic point and shoot camera.

I will use it for simple things and as a secondary camera to my large 35mm SLR.  I am a fairly skilled photographer so not having manual controls for f-stop and shutter speed is frustrating, but the different modes do all that so if you can figure them out you're alright.  The biggest problem with this camera I have had is battery life.  I have had it three days, and it has gone through three sets of Duracell alkaline batteries.

Generally, it takes good pictures.  However, if you have young children and intend to take a lot of inside photos, where the flash is used, I would not recommend this camera for the following reasons: (1) the shutter delay is very noticable (after you press the button and by the time the picture is captured, the kid has moved out of the picture), (2) when the flash is used, this camera take a long time to recharge the flash and until the flash is recharged you cannot take another picture (the delay is roughly 10 seconds for an inside shot -- for me).  Anyway, I was so fustrated by having a lot of shots of my kid's head and missing a few pictures waiting for the flash to recycle, I broke down and got a Kodak.

It was generally well-reviewed from several online sources.2.) The price with package rebates was very good.I was very diappointed with the performance of the camera once I got it home - my 4 year-old HP 2 megapixel camera is easier to use and takes better photos.  The camera's poor performance is not due to any defect, since I purchased another Coolpix 4100 from a local source and it has the same poor performance.  Nor is it operator error, since I'm not a novice - but a good consumer digital camera should give acceptable performance for most situations right out of the box for even novice users.The GOOD:1. Uses 2 AA NiMHs - I didn't experience excessive power drain as some people have complained.2. Very lightweight.3. Decent outdoor performance.4. Good macro performance.5. Low price.The BAD:1. Didn't like the new 128MB SD card I got along with the camera and would reject it on power-up about 1/2 the time.2. Menu system sub-par, requiring several layers of navigation, although it does seem to keep settings after power-off.3. Only ISO 50,100,200 equivalent speed - no ISO 400 as found in most 4 MP cameras.4. Slow cycle time after flash usage.The UGLY:1. *TERRIBLE* autofocus system with no manual alternative.  Failed to achieve focus lock in most low-light settings, and even when \"locked\", most of my indoor photos were blurred in the default camera setting and \"Indoor/Party\" SCENE setting.  Only using the \"Backlit\" SCENE setting was I able to get even marginally acceptable photos indoors.2. Poor image quality (when not blurred) compared to my co-worker's Sony DSC-P92 digicam in side-by-side tests.3. Extreme ghosting in fluorescent lighting, even when white-balanced for that situation.This camera (and the printer and SD card I got for the rebates) are going back...probably will get an A85 instead or stick with my trusty vintage Minolta X-700.

I have had the camera for a little over 5 months now and still love it. I won't debate the fact that the reload time takes an extra second but are we really that impatient? I've never missed a shot because of the reload time.The Nikon has a lot of capabilities for it's price such as video imaging and you can record a message to go along with your pictures.Last month, I lost my Nikon for 2 weeks and I was about to purchase another camera but couldn't find any that I was willing to pay for to match up to the Nikon, but luckily I found my camera so I didn't have to worry about buying another. I don't take it for granted anymore.As far as the batteries go, I'll admit, I used up about 3 pairs of AA batteries within the first 3 days of having my camera. At the same time I must say that I did play with it from the time I woke up until I went to bed again. To remedy the problem, I bought the Lithium AA (Energizer brand) and I haven't had to replace the batteries in two months.

This is my first digital camera and I have never enjoyed taking pictures this much.Two gripes: the LCD screen is small by today's standards which makes it hard to see your picture.  There is a noticeable lag between pictures, where you have to wait for the camera to ready itself before you can take the next picture.  This isn't always a problem unless you take a lot of pictures of subjects in motion.", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "PRICE says it all !!!", "Author": "mom to 3 boys", "ReviewID": "R12GH1RGAQ73CI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted at least 4.0 (guarantees a better quality photo and larger print then 3.0 & 2.0) which the Nikon coolpix 4100 has and I didn't want to pay much. When I got online and saw I could get the coolpix for under $200 (almost all 4.0 megpix are around $300) I couldn't resist buying it but then I read a couple bad reviews and wonder if I made a good buy.After actually using the Coolpix 4100 I can clarify some of those bad reviews. I notice in most of the bad reviews the people are comparing the coolpix 4100 to $500-$1,000 cameras (that I own too)is not fair. It's like buying a ford escort because it's cheap and then complaining about how it doesn't measure up to a hummer.SHUTTER SPEED----Some reviews complained about the shutter time being to slow. After you snap your picture the screen goes black (for about 1 to 1.5 seconds) remember it has to transfer your photo to memory it TAKES TIME, before it comes back up to were you can snap another picture. !!!!!!You Really don't wait that Long!!!!!!!!! espcially if you Never used a more exspensive model then you'll never EVEN notice the coolpix has a delay, others did because again they were comparing a ford to hummer. If you want a camera that has like 0.1/1000th of delay (means you can snap a picture & be back up within blink of an eye to snap another picture)so don't miss any shot, then I suggest buying a digital Canon EOS for $2,000.BATTIER----Some reviews complain because it uses AAA battier and they don't last long. Be glad it uses AAA if it use a lithium the camera would cost $200-$300 more and you won't even be looking at it. Lithium does last longer but it cost more to build lithium capability into a camera; By Nikon putting in AAA knocks about $200 off the price. As for the AAA battier not lasting long enough, I think those people are leaving the camera on while they sleep or something. The 1st day I got my camera (using the batters that came in the box) I took picture from 12pm till late at night testing all the different modes it had, in different lights. I even used the camera's battier to up loaded my pictures unto my computer and I still had plenty of battier power for the next day.FLASH -- I'll agree with the reviews that said the flash isn't very good ( why I gave it 4 stars). The flash really doesn't light up a dark room, most of the picture I took inside my house at night did seem to be a little darkish & I got red eyes (with the red eye reduction on) but you could still see my kids faces and I use the software to remove the red eye so I thought the picture came out pretty good. You can shop around But I gaurentee all digital under $200 the flash won't be really that great (again why it cost less then $2,000 camera). But the one thing the coolpix has that other lower price cameras don't; is a back flash (which is a slower ISO) it will light up dark room really well (but this is something you have to set yourself in the flash menu it won't do it automatically)PICTURE QUALITY -- with 4.0 megpix you won't be disappointed, I don't think I read any bad reviews on picture quality. I took over 60 pictures of my cats running, my kids jumping up and down and all the picture were Clear and Blur free, which amazed Me because I have hard time getting that sometimes with my Canon EOS. And the button are so easy to use on the coolpix (I figured them all out wihtout even opening the manual)Over all if your mainly looking at size & ****PRICE**** of this camera, then you won't be disappoint. I think some people are excepting to much from the low price camera by comparing it to $2,000 digital. I'm very please with this camera I think it's the best camera out there for the Price, The price says it all!!!! Under $200 for 4.0 you can't do any better.", "Date": "March 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nice first digital.", "Author": "Anne Marie", "ReviewID": "R14CPI91899KTY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a gift and it is the first digital camera I have had.  I am very happy with it and my pictures are turning out better than ever.  It is simple to operate and the menus are very easy to follow and navigate.  I use it mainly for snapshots and for taking along while traveling when I don't want to lug my other camera along.  Its small size is perfect for putting in a pocket or purse.The quality of the pictures it takes is Very,very good.  You can compare pictures from this camera (actually the 3 Megapixel version) and the Nikon D70 (Nikons top of the line digital)at image-resource.com. The pictures from the Coolpix are nearly as good as the ones from the D70!  In fact you can compare pictures from almost any camera on the market. In my opinion the Coolpix is superior to many more expensive cameras. Check it out. In the close up setting the Coolpix is far better than almost every camera out there!I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the flash is only average, and you can get blury shots in low light.  This camera does have a neat feature with its blur warning, if it reads that light is to low it will warn you.  I am still learning this camera so there might be a way to adjust for this. Putting the camera on a small tripod for low light shots would solve this too.Overall, I am very satisfied with how easy it is to use and the quality of the pictures it takes.", "Date": "January 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "loved it", "Author": "Rachel \"rae\"", "ReviewID": "R1LPHLRJ22KV4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutley love this camera.
