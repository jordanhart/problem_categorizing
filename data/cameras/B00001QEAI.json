Ferrell", "ReviewID": "R13J1Q0Y0BUEL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After buying a Sony Vaio F290 notebook, and being completely thrilled with it, my next step was to study up, and learn about digital cameras. I've been doing photography for years, but am not a professional. I have had my  Mavica 83 for just one month, but the real thrill was taking it out onto  the beach, two hours after bringing it home, and easily taking my first 2  floppies full of pictures! The menu is easily understandable, and the  quality of the pictures I've taken, is excellent. The 6x digital zoom is  also excellent for most shots. I love being able to copy the contents of  one full disk onto another (to share) right in the camera's 4x drive. I'd  heard negative reviews, concerning it only having the LCD, but with a bit  of practice, this becomes second nature. All LCD's have some problems with  & in the sun, but if you know how to set up your shot, this isn't a  problem. The flash is very stark/bright in & on your photo. It's so  much fun and very easy sending pictures by email! I think everyone in my  family will probably be buying a digital for Christmas! I went to several  stores, to pick up, handle and move around with the menu's, of all the  camera's I could find. I recommend you do this too, if you're going to buy  one. Some camera's just don't feel right in your hands. The controls on  this camera are conveniently placed. I have a couple \"newspaper\"  writing friends, and they tell me, they use Mavica 83's from the office  too. That seemed good enough for me! The only thing I am not satisfied  with, is the battery life. Yes, I'm turning off my LCD too, in hopes of  extending it, but, the battery doesn't have the stated minutes life. The  macro is also excellent, and can really catch some interesting views. There  are cheaper cameras, and getting more powerful by the week, but for now, I  highly recommend the Mavica 83. Being able to use floppies as film, is  great, as you can share these with anyone, and it's the cheapest way to go.  My only wish is that they had included a cap / protective cover, for the  LCD.", "Date": "November 26, 1999"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera if no need for large photorealistic prints", "Author": "Andrew N. Carpenter \"philosopher\"", "ReviewID": "R1XGHFVKKOIO8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a well-engineered camera: its feature set, build quality, interface, battery life, optics, and ergonometrics are all top-notch. It is a joy to use and produces high-quality pictures for web site or small  photorealistic prints, especially if you use the \"fine\" mode that  imposes less jpeg compression. There is also a thriving Mavican  community on the 'net, and lots of useful freeware shareware, and  third-party accessories. If you need to print out 8X10 photorealistic  prints, buy a 2 megapixel camera; for everything short of this, the Mavica  83 is a superb camera. Unlike other reviewers, I find that this camera does  a respectable job in low-light situations.One drawback is the optical  zoom, which is \"only\" 3X. Sony's high-quality teleconverter  (~$50) will increase this to 6X. Its use of 1.4mb floppy disk storage  hasn't been a drawback for me: the 4X floppy drive is quick, it is easy to  change floppies, and one floppy holds a respectable number of images  (around 8 in 1024X768 fine mode, around 20 in 640X480 fine mode).The  brief MPEG movies are great fun, and an easy way to create video e-mail or  to add streaming video web sites.For the price, I'd prefer this  high-quality .8 megapixel camera to the \"bargain\" 2 megapixel  cameras, which may have inferior optics.My conclusion: Don't believe the  hype about the \"need\" for 2 megapixel cameras. For e-mail, web,  and smaller prints, the Mavica 83 occupies a great \"sweet spot:\"  it combines many higher-end features with superior ease-of-use,  convenience, and optics.", "Date": "January 3, 2000"}, {"Title": "Digital Camera for Dummies!", "Author": "hrd2pls \"hrd2pls\"", "ReviewID": "R14FXJ62XTR4OO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't help but rave about Sony Mavica FD-83's versatility!  It has auto/manual focus, digital zoom, four different picture effects including black & white, 2 image quality modes, and it can also record a short  video with voice.  You'd wonder if you have to be a hi-tech guru to operate  a camera loaded with features.  Not so!  This camera is soooo easy to use  that I didn't even have to read the manual to make it work the first time I  got it.  I just popped in a floppy disk, took pictures, took the floppy out  and into my computer and presto! QUALITY pictures right before your eyes!  Of course, after finally reading the manual, I found out about the other  wonderful features of FD-83.  My favorite is the \"E-mail\" setting  which automatically makes a copy of the pictures you take in a much smaller  file size and therefore,  cuts the upload and download times of the  pictures you send through email.  No more playing around with your pictures  to reduce the file size, it's all done for you!  There's more to this  camera than I have space to write about them for.  Read the other reviews.

One very good feature, at least for me,  is its great macro capability and manual focus. You can take objects as  close as 1 cm. You can also control the exposure level which for close  distance shots is a very usefull feature. But the best feature for me is  the fact that it stores in floppy disks.

I need images quick and a lot of them.  The FD83 just fullfulled all my expectations.  The limited storage on the floppy is not a problem....I just keep a lot of them handy.  I can reel off  the images I need, edit them, and store them for future reference.The  resolution, while some say is lower quality, seems pretty great as well.  I  can actually take digital photos of paintings or prints and get immediate  good prints to send to perspective clients or even print out on a good  photorealistic printer for mini art prints (but be sure it's on good paper  and with good ink).

If you want web or computer images, it is an excellent camera.  If you want professional prints, get a 35mm film camera.  I have all but replaced my  35mm for almost all my photo uses.

Don't rely too much on the  supplied manual - you have to experiment - but since you're not 'wasting  film', you can afford to.  I find the floppy storage to be very convenient.

After looking at cameras from other vendors and trying cameras that our other departments were using our group decided upon the Mavica mainly because of the floppy drive. Overall, we have been delighted with  the camera except for the fact that it is limited to daytime usage. In dim  light conditions one has to be almost on top of the subject or the result  is too dark. In addition, we found that the LCD screen was easily scratched  by shirt buttons when the camera was carried on the strap around the neck.  Also in the year of ownership we have had a floppy drive failure.  Be aware  that free labor charges end after 90 days and the normal charge is $ for  repair. The parts are free within the first year of ownership. In  conclusion, for daylight outdoor scenes or indoor scenes with the right  lighting conditions this is a good camera.

I took both interior and exterior  shots of homes and with very little effort I could print up a promotional  highlight sheet, which was both professional and impressive.  The camera  was easy to use and the floppy disk is a very versatile way to obtain the  quick results I required. It is a good buy.", "Date": "December 20, 1999"}, {"Title": "It's very good", "Author": "ggjn@sprynet.com", "ReviewID": "R23UYF2EBW0JFT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the FD-83 after having borrowed my father's FD-81 off and on for several months.  Unfortunately, my FD-83 had a technical problem (autofocus always mis-focused) which required me to return it for repairs  under warranty. I live in the Boston area and so there is a Sony repair  station nearby.  They made good on the warranty and since that time it has  serviced us well.The picture resolution is slightly less than you'll  find on other digital cameras **BUT** the convenience of diskettes (to me)  far outweighs any resolution or storage issues.  Someone mentioned that  diskettes are expensive.  You can purchase a 100-pack at any office supply  house for around $20, so I really don't consider 20 cents per diskette as  being costly.If you use the standard resolution, which I find myself  doing most of the time, I get around 20 pics on a floppy.  What I have  found as an unexpected convenient bonus is the copy feature -- you can make  multiple copies of photos or photo-diskettes on the spot.  This is handy  when you are on vacation or visiting people.  And, of course, 3.5 inch  diskettes are available anywhere.  When going on an outing I carry five or  six.  This enables me to snap 100 pics for around a buck, and this assumes  I never reuse the diskettes.  While the higher resolution pics and  *.mpg features are nice and probably were effective at convincing me to  purchase this,  I realize now I almost never use those features.  I also  refrain from using the digital zoom and stay within the 3:1 optical zoom  range.  If I had a longer optical zoom, I would use that, and Sony has made  inroads on that in their higher models.From using the older FD-81, I  also used MGI Photosuite as the software, which is what Sony used to  distribute with their cameras.  The FD-83 I have came with different  software (ArcSoft with Polaroid PhotoMax) that has more features but I find  myself preferring the MGI package more or Microsoft Photo Editor. I just  personally find those easier to use.All in all, do I recommend this?  YES.  I did see other cameras that took better pictures, but how much  clarity do you need on a 19-inch screen?  Or an 8 x 10 printed photo?  This  does the job adequately.  And the general ease of use, as well as having  diskette media convenience makes this worth using. If I really want  super-sharp pictures that I would display in a slide show on a 15 foot  screen - I can reach for my trusty Canon AE-1 35MM camera.

SHIELDS", "ReviewID": "R4SWQ6A2554VF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't believe the person in the previous message.  Megapixel mode (1216x912) will result in 4 to 7 images on a standard floppy disk depending upon the complexity of the image.  1024x768 mode results in 7 to 10 photos  on a disk.  640x480 mode results in 14 to 20+ photos on the disk.  The max  resolution stated on Amazon is not 1024x768 (that's an error that needs  correcting).  The camera takes very nice 5, 10, or 15 second MPG movies in  either 160x120 or 320x200 mode.  I've had this camera for three months now  and carry it with me everywhere, along with a box of disks.  At the minimum  I keep a fresh disk in the camera.  With a rechargable battery that I've  used full blast taking photos on 25+ disks for two hours, you can't beat  it.  Memory sticks are convenient as you won't have to unload and reload  your camera, but nothing beats being able to take the disk out of the  camera, hand it to someone, and be done with it.  They can pop that disk  into any PC or Mac and view the contents without going through any memory  stick download process at all.  What I do hope is that Sony picks up on the  SuperDisk 120-MB floppy technology and incorporates it into their next line  of cameras.  That should resolve any \"not enough space on a disk\"  issues.

I like the camera...I'm just really unhappy with the media it uses. When I said floppy disks were expensive, I  meant on a per-magabyte basis. For my example, I'll use the Iomega Clik!  disk (40 MB) A floppy disk usually costs about a dollar and a half (when  bought by itself). A Clik! disk costs $15 dollars by itself. You need to  buy 27 3 1/2 floppy disks to equal a Clik!. That's $25 more, thus making  the floppy disk less cost-efficient.  (To be fair, I'll counteract my own  case. I know people buy floppies in bulk, but you can do the same with the  Clik!'s, CompactFlashes, and SmartMedia cards. Also, there's the issue of  buying the $150 Clik! Drive, but after buying 6 disks, it pays for  itself.)This is another product that could ONLY sell in America, where  we put convienience over quality and [cost-]effeciency. This camera was  great a couple years ago, but now, as floppies are starting to die (but it  will still take a few years), the technology is getting stale.
