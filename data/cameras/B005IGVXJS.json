{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good camera for the serious hobbyist", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2IF93K6289TJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the past two decades I've been an avid photographer. My professional equipment choices have leaned towards Nikon.  My point and shoot purchases towards Canon. I was in the market for a camera with the following attributes:A decent travel camera.Full Creative and manual controls.Swing out LCD screen.Compatibility with the Nikon Creative Lighting System.PortabilityHigh quality images including RAW output.Good reliable performanceGood build qualityThe Canon G12 was definitely in the running. So was the  Olympus XZ1, Panasonic LX5 and the deeply discounted Nikon CoolPix P7000 These were all good camera's mind you. In the end I choose the P7100 after taking the Canon G12 and Nikon P7000 out for a test drive.For the past week I've been putting my P7100 through its paces.First thing I noticed was that the 3\" LCD screen rendered beautiful almost photo surreal images and made shooting overhead in a crowd or doing Macro photography a breeze. The problems with the menu in the P7000 seemed to have all been ironed out in the P7100. Navigation and overall performance was quick and responsive.There seems to be a button for everything including two customization buttons that offered quick access to favorite features such as Nikon's D-Lighting for difficult lighting situations or the Virtual Horizon display for taking level photo's.I have large hands so even though this camera was a little larger then the usual size in this category it felt very comfortable and well balanced, especially with the rubberized grip.One of the intriguing features was the HDR mode for back-lit situations.  As I understand it the P7100 takes several pictures with a little D-Lighting magic and offers up a composite image. It seemed to work perfectly. Just for fun I plugged in my Nikon SB-400 flash. Works beautifully. I didn't really try out the video since I have no need of it.From Twilight to dusk most of my photo images were keepers.So here's what we got in Pro's and Con's.ProAbundant manual and creative control.Articulated 3\" 921,000 dot LCD screen.Built in 2 stop ND filter (wonderful!)Outstanding battery life720p @ 30fps video (love the frame rate)Rubberized covering for good gripLive HistogramConStingy Viewfinder. But it's better then nothing.All of the documentation is PDF's on a CD ROM.Drivers for RAW files are not available yet for Windows.720p @ 30fps video (not 1080p but love the frame rate)SummaryThe 35 to 200mm equivalent zoom capability renders beautiful clean photo images from ISO 100 through 400. I had a lot of fun experimenting and playing with the scene modes. The P7100 is quick and responsive. I'm very happy with this camera and its performance. This is a camera for people who want full creative control.Five Stars!Update:Relax and rejoice! Adobe just released the Lightroom 3.5 update that includes  Nikon P7100 Raw support. Images look great in Lightroom.update Nov 2012:Over a year later.  Still love this camera.  No complaints.  I use it more then my Nikon DSLR D700!  Its my go to camera for total creative control.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "An excellent camera.", "Author": "Frank B", "ReviewID": "R1ZQ137ZI9S9VC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the P7100 for over 3 weeks and I am extremely pleased with it.  I think the quality of the RAW images from the P7100 are as good as many a DSLR at ISO 100.  The JPEGS are also, excellent. Of course, as the ISOs get higher there is more noise due to the smaller sensor, but it does very well at all ISOs for a compact camera, but do not expect DSLR low noise levels.I find the ergonomics and features of the P7100 are excellent and very much like a DSLR. I love the articulated LCD. For me, the articulated LCD makes a huge difference. I now am taking photos with perspectives I simply did not try to get before with a fixed LCD.  Also, I can steady the camera against my body with the LCD in horizontal position to reduce camera shake and it is easier to see in bright sunlight. There is a Command Dial and a Sub-Command dial and the two dials makes Manual Mode easy to use, although this is not a mode I typically use, as there is no histogram available when using Manual Mode prior to taking the photo and you can not see exposure changes reflected in the LCD, as you can in other modes (P,S,A, ), when using Exposure Compensation. I particularly like the exposure compensation dial and the range of up to +/-3f/stops. Also, the placement of the AE-L/AF_L button is such that I can easily press and hold it with my thumb and press the shutter with my index finger (you can not release it without canceling the setting).  There is also a Quick Menu Dial that allows you to access many parameters without having to go through the menu system.  The menu system is O.K. but it could be better arranged. I find that there are enough buttons and dials (which are laid out well) so that I do not need to access the menus much. There are also 3 custom user modes that can be set up, but I have not done so.  Some people say that having an optical viewfinder which is small and shows \"only\" 80% of the field of view makes it next to useless.  I  do not agree. In situations where it is difficult to see the LCD (so far I have not had to use the optical viewfinder due to this problem with my P7100) or for action photos it is very useful. Also, the optical viewfinder held against your face helps to steady the camera and reduce camera shake. Of course, the Nikon 7100 has built in vibration reduction. My P7100 is replacing my P7000 which had a fixed LCD and I did use the optical viewfinder when I had trouble seeing the LCD and for action shots and it was very useful.  The fastest shutter speed is 1/4000, however it can only be used at wide angle and f/8.  So for practical purposes the fastest shutter speed available is usually 1/2000. There is a built in neutral density filter enabling you to reduce exposure by 3 f/stops to avoid overexposure. Also, the built in flash has exposure compensation of +/-2 f/stops available. I believe you can use Nikon external Speedlight flashes SB-400, 600, 700 and 900, as well as the Su-800 wireless commander with the P7100. However, I don't know if all the features of these flashes can be used. I think for example, to use a wireless flash you may need the Commander.I find that the speed of the P7100 is fine with the menus changing quickly and generally fast focus.  There are times when focus slows down and I may have to change the focus setting to get focus.  This occurs in low contrast situations. Overall, though I am happy with the way it focuses. The time it takes to write RAW files and RAW/JPEG is a little slow and Nikon hopefully will improve on this in the future \"editions\". Also, the number of frames per second is low compared to some cameras, so action photography is a bit more of a challenge. I think that to get faster frame rates Nikon would have to use a different type of sensor and probably this would result in a lessening of picture quality. So I am happy that Nikon did not go that route and I like the extra challenge of catching the moment rather than relying on the camera to take a bunch of frames.The P7100 is about as heavy and large as I am willing to accept in a compact camera.  However, it fits easily into the front pocket of my shorts and into my jacket pocket. I can also just squeeze it into the front pocket of my well worn jeans. My only purpose in switching from a DSLR to a smaller camera was so I could carry it in my pocket and 'forget' about it.  The P7100 meets those requirements and the extra size and heft, compared to some compacts, gives it a very nice feel in my hands. The reason I chose the P7100 over its competitors was because of the extra focal length on the telephoto side. For me, the new small interchangeable lens mirrorless cameras with an equivalent focal range of 28mm to 200mm lens are still too big and heavy to bother with. I do have the Nikon wide angle converter and adapter for the P7100 so I have a total focal length range of 21mm to 200mm equivalent - when I decide to carry the converter/adapter with me. :)I will not comment on the P7100's video capabilities, as I do not use video.For my photographic purposes I would rate the P7100 with 4.5 stars.  It is the best compact camera I have owned. I rounded up to 5 stars  rather than down to 4 stars when I rated it above.  I highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera", "Author": "sycamore", "ReviewID": "R3K3S6EDJV4B3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using the P7100 for over a month now.  I am familiar with the camera as I used the P7000 before (for one year and since it came out).  I did have problems with the P7000, but mainly issues with the lens cover not opening fully and those issues developed very early on.  The Coolpix P7100 does not exhibit those problems so it's a great camera. I tested it on a 1000 pictures in one week.  It takes wonderful pictures with very appealing and natural colors.  Everybody comments on the picture quality. So optics are great.The camera is user friendly with lots of dials that save time.  The predecessors did not have all the dials.  I have used the camera in all possible modes and find it responsive.  I have captured action pictures such as surfers, bikers, runners, volley ball players and the camera delivers wonderful results with very sharp pictures.I am not a photographer.  I just enjoy taking pictures.  But I have taken the time to learn the camera. One can snap some shots without bothering with the manual settings.  But it can do so much if the user  takes the time to learn its potential; and most photographers who use it as a backup do use those features.  It's not to be compared to a DSLR. People often make that mistake. However, the picture quality is very close to that of a DSLR.  I know, because people who own DSLR have commented on P7100 pictures being very much like those of a DSLR.  It's a very smart camera, as long as it is used as it should.  If you don't want to bother with the features available then there are other products on the market, simpler and cheaper or just use an iphone.I love the long (200mm) zoom which is very useful in some situations.  Comparable advanced compacts don't have the long zoom.The camera performs wonderfully in low light - I often take pictures in difficult light conditions (such as mountain scenes),in very low light, twilight etc., and I am consistently happy with the results.  But those features were equally good with the P7000.The RAW write time has improved from the predecessor and is very acceptable now.It's always possible to find flaws with a camera.  People have different expectations. But I use this camera all the time and I love it.  I like to challenge it with hard to do shots and I have fun. I always get good results in my opinion (and several other people who saw my pictures). It is the only camera I use.  My SLR is a film camera. I don't see the point of switch to DSLR, not with the P7100.This camera is fairly new and just because someone owns a DSLR, and perhaps a Nikon DSLR does not imply that this person has carefully taken the time with the P7100.  Every product requires an acquaintance time.  All I can say is that I like what comes out of this camera and I love the pictures that other people take with this camera; and many people take much better pics than me with that same camera.The only disappointment for me is the lack of a user's guide; but I use the P7000 guide if I need to refer to it should I forget something.  The P7100 has few added features though, such as scenes with effects.  For the most part I know the camera and rarely need the book, but for someone new to the camera it might be a problem.I do recommend this camera.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really good, serious small camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R15CYKX1ZNKRWO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, a little background: I'm a longtime Nikon user since the days of film, but when it comes to point-and-shoot digital cameras, Nikon's offerings really haven't measured up to what the competitors were putting out. I have a Nikon D700 DSLR, which is awesome. But in searching for something more portable and convenient that wouldn't entail a huge sacrifice in image quality, I've finally found what I'm looking for in Nikon's Coolpix lineup: the P7100.This is, flat-out, the best compact camera in this price range that I've ever used, and I've tried plenty from various makers. I had considered the Nikon 1 series mirrorless cameras, but the price seems a bit steep for what they are, and the idea of having a second camera with interchangeable lenses undercut the convenience factor. So I gave the P7100 a try, and I don't regret it at all.Here are the pros and cons as I see them:Pros:Great image quality and the ability to shoot in Raw, which very few Coolpix cameras allow. If you don't know, shooting in Raw gives you much better control and more options in processing your photos. It's far easier to correct bad white balance, for one.A built-in neutral density filter allows you to use a longer exposure in bright conditions (good for waterfalls and seascapes).An interval timer for time-lapse shooting.A relatively fast aperture (2.8 at the wide end of the zoom) and good low-light performance (noise is very well controlled for a small camera).A real hotshoe and compatibility with Nikon's Creative Lighting System (you can use any speedlight in Nikon's lineup) for professional-quality lighting in portraits and other shots.Fast, accurate autofocus with subject tracking that really works.Vibration reduction (reduces blur from camera shake at slow shutter speeds).An optical viewfinder (I rarely use it, but it's nice to have when you do need it).A tilt-out LCD display (makes shooting from the hip, or ground level, much easier).Full manual controls for aperture, shutter, ISO, white balance and exposure compensation (You get to decide instead of the camera! What a concept!)Cons:The zoom range is good, but not great (optical zoom is 28mm to 200mm in 35mm equivalent. You can go wider, to 20mm equivalent, but the adapter and lens to do that cost about half what the camera itself does.) It would be nice to be able to hit 300mm with the optical zoom.It's on the large size for a compact camera (you'll need a big pocket if you want to keep it there).CLS functionality is limited to one remote group of speedlights. Just Group A, no B or C.Top video quality is 740p at 24fps, not 1080p, and like all small cameras, the built-in microphone picks up clicks and thumps as you zoom or operate the camera.If you're like me, you want the camera defaults always set on the highest quality settings. In order to do that, you must shoot Raw+Jpg Fine. That way if you're shooting Raw and you switch to a scene mode where the camera only shoots jpg, it will stay at Fine quality (the camera default, which can't be permanently changed, is normal quality). Just make sure you have a good sized memory card so it doesn't fill up with jpgs you don't need.The sensor count of 10 megapixels is a bit small by today's standards. I would have liked at least 12, but unless you're heavily cropping your photos, 10 is plenty. Honestly, the quality is so good, I keep being surprised when I remember that it's \"only\" 10 MP.The strobe effect of the redeye reduction on the built-in flash is painful. It's really bright. Use it if you like photos of people wincing. When I use the popup flash on my D700, I don't notice this. There's something different. Thankfully, you can always use a real speedlight.Other observations:There are a bunch of scene modes (most are jpg only, no Raw), including a backlit HDR mode, which automatically merges shots at different exposures) and a low-light mode, along with some special effects (I like the zoom exposure mode). Battery life is good for a day's shooting; you can shoot time lapses without worry.I absolutely love this camera.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finest Point and Shoot Camera on the market!", "Author": "D. Peterson \"Computer user\"", "ReviewID": "RO3W7ODC9RW2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to be a pro photographer but since my retirement I just wanted to have a nice point and shoot camera for all my shooting needs.  Nikon P7100 far exceeded my expectations.  I would have gotten the P7000 but instead I waited for the P7100 because I wanted the tilt LCD screen...please note that long before Nikon came out with this camera I did put in a request to Nikon for a tilt screen on the future models, I don't know if Nikon listen to me or not but I am tickled that they did come out with it.  The P7100 is a little larger in physical size than the P7000 plus 2 oz heavier which is no problem.  One feature that I really like is the 800mm digital telephoto which is sharper and clearer than all other models I tried...way better than the Canon G12,  I had the G12 for a while but took it back to the store because of it's many limitations, then I got the Nikon P7100 because there are no limitations!  The G12 had a lot of molting in it's lowlight pictures while the Nikon has no molting at all.  The G12 only goes to 140mm while the Nikon P7100 goes to 200mm plus over 800mm on the digital telephoto which is far superior than all other cameras I tested.  The P7100 menus are very easy to use and very straight forward, also, the dedicated buttons are well thought out and strategically located for ease of use.  It is one of the easiest to use cameras on the market!  It is extremely fast in low light situations!  Shutter lag is negligent!  The LCD screen is easy to see outdoors in bright sunlight plus the LCD screen shows accurate colors unlike the new LCD screens on the new CMOS type cameras which show inaccurate colors so you can't use the LCD screen to see exactly what you are getting....but with the Nikon p7100 it's colors on the LCD screen are spot-on!  I read one reviewer's report who rated this camera with one star based on his inability to use the enclosed nikon software which is NOT fair for reviewing of this camera.  I have an Apple Macbook with iPhoto and PhotoShop Elements 8 editing software and it works flawlessly with my Macbook especially the RAW files which are extremely easy to use so why anyone would have any problems especially on an Apple Mac computer would have to be mentally challenged.  There are a lot of new cameras on the market today with many bells and whistles but all I wanted was the finest of features that would enable me to take good pictures but the Nikon P7100  takes exceptional pictures!  If you want the finest point and shoot camera on today's market then this is the camera for you but if you like to be razzle dazzled with a lot of fancy bells and whistles of which most you'd never use then go for the new whiz-banner CMOS cameras that cost twice the price....  For super excellent photography at a fair price that will last you a lifetime then go for the Nikon P7100", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon P7100: A truly excellent compact for serious users", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "R32SHDM5NSOTSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When Nikon released the Coolpix P7000 in 2010, I took a close, hard look at it.  That camera seemed to have most of the features that I was looking for in a compact pro-level digital camera without the bulk of a DSLR.  I had a chance to use one belonging to a friend for a few days, and though I liked it, the overall performance seemed a bit slow, especially compared with the Canon G12 owned by another friend.First, the P7000 was slower than the G12 in most every way, and the Canon had an excellent 2.8-inch Vari-Angle LCD panel, a feature that I had come to really appreciate with my own Nikon D5000 DSLR.  The Canon was very tempting, but I decided to wait and explore other options in pro/enthusiast compact cameras.  And while I was narrowing the field, Nikon announced a new camera in the fall of 2011.I'm glad that I waited, because after doing plenty of research and comparison between the current offerings of cameras like this including some that were being announced, I bought the Nikon COOLPIX P7100.  Sometimes it's good to hold up on buying what one really needs.I had explored the new mirrorless cameras from Nikon and others, but for serious, practical photography with a camera smaller than a regular DSLR, this one fits precisely that role.  The lens is fixed, but it's a Nikkor that equates to a 28-200mm on a 35mm SLR, a 7.1x zoom in fact.  There's also a small optical viewfinder that may be tiny, but it's useful when needed.Getting down to the subjective nitty-gritty, here are my basic observations.Pros:* Substantial 7.1x optical zoom range; extra punch over 5x helps* Tilting 3-inch Vari-Angle LCD display is just what's needed* Excellent image quality, far better than anticipated* Superb ergonomics; rational array of controls* Very respectable battery life; averaging 320 - 350 shots per charge* Much faster operational speeds than the P7000* Uses readily-available SD card; SDXC support* RAW (NRW) support for when needed for serious images* Hot shoe accepts wide variety of Nikon Speedlights* Rubberized grip area on the bodyCons:* Wish the P7100 would go to 24mm wide angle, but a 28-200mm zoom is more important* f/2.8 maximum aperture limits it's low-light use; f/2.0 would be good* Only 720p HD video offered; subjectively not crucialMaking Choices:Besides the Nikon COOLPIX P7100, I had taken a realistic and objective look at a number of better digital cameras that I hoped would meet my own subjective individual needs, and then narrowed the list to the following: the Canon G12 10 MP Digital Camera with it's 5x optical image stabilized zoom and 2.8 Inch Vari-Angle LCD display, and the Fujifilm X10 12 MP EXR CMOS Digital Camera, which featured its f2.0-f2.8 4x optical zoom and a 2.8-Inch LCD display.  Each of these cameras had very strong points, each with its own set of features that would be useful for the creative process.But even though the Fuji X10 had a very fast and sharp lens, it had the shortest zoom range and its LCD screen was fixed as opposed to the tilting screens of the Canon and the Nikon, so that left two.  The Nikon had a significantly higher LCD screen resolution than the Canon (921k dots vs. 461k dots), and the Nikon's LCD at 3.0 inches was about 10% larger than that on the Canon.  The Canon offered slightly more dynamic range (11.2 EV vs. 10.7 EV), about half a stop, and a bit better macro capability, but the Nikon's 7x optical zoom (28mm - 200mm) compared to the Canon's 5x (28mm - 140mm) was the final deal clincher for me.I would suggest to that anyone considering the Nikon P7100 that it's worth the time to take a close look at these three cameras that go many steps above the general point and shoot category in features and quality of images.  We each have our priorities; choices are a subjective thing for each of us, and for me the Nikon offered the best balance of what I was looking for.First Impressions:There wasn't much about the P7100 that I wasn't aware of before it arrived and took it out of the box, as I had already played with a couple of them.  When first unboxed, it was apparent that the Nikon attention to detail was all here.  The first thing that's noticed is how solid this camera feels, and maybe that's partially due to its magnesium chassis.  Followed the printed Quick Start Guide and charged the battery for the recommended 1 \u00bd hours while reading and going through the box contents.  This camera came packaged with:- EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery- MH-24 Battery Charger- AN-CP21 Strap- Reference Manual on CD-ROM- NikonView NX 2 CD-ROM- UC-E6 USB Cable- EG-CP16 Audio/Video CableThe MH-24 Battery Charger blinks when charging, and glows steadily when the battery is topped up.  Put the battery cap in a safe place for when it's needed.  Once the battery was charged, inserted a Class 10 SDHC card and took the P7100 out for a trial run.Even though I had played with this P7100 before, I now had a chance to really put it through its paces.  This one was mine.  Larger than most compacts, this camera subjectively has a comfortable feel; everything seems to fit the hand quite easily.  There are enough controls and options that can be set to customize it to ones individual preferences, and in my initial explorations, found that this was easy to accomplish.The P7100 In Use:The small quick menu dial on the top of the camera body quickly became my ally, and it made access of the various functions such as ISO settings, white balance, auto bracketing and such to be far easier than exploring the camera menus.  Fiddled with various shots trying face detection, the various metering settings and such, all part of the learning experience.  This method is far better than digging into the viewfinder menus to access the various features.The small optical viewfinder is useful under some circumstances, but be aware that you really getting about 80% of what will actually show in your resulting images.  It's useful when needed, but the tilting 3-inch Vari-Angle LCD display is for this user where this camera really shines.  It's a brilliant and very sharp monitor, offering very close to 100% of what your results will be, and for one who wears glasses, those 921,000 dots do help.  It allows for creativity from some fairly awkward angles, and as I have made good and frequent use of this feature on my D5000, am happy to have it on this camera.Once one gets used to it, and that doesn't take long, the ergonomics and controls of the P7100 are excellent.  Now that I've spent some real time with it, there's nothing that I would change in that respect.  Am not a much of a video shooter, but from the little that I've done, the video quality is good.  The 720p may be a bit dated for some, but if you need to shoot only the occasional video, then it should be adequate.The built-in flash does a better job than was expected, and within the abilities of how these function, have no complaints with the results.  But when I attached and used the Nikon SB-400, the resulting images were close to dazzling.  I've used my SB-400 and the older SB-600 on my Nikon DSLRs, but this combination on the P7100 helped produce some of my best flash images ever.Issues:As noted early, I'm getting a very respectable 320 - 350 shots per charge with the standard EN-EL14 battery, but experience is a good teacher, so I usually try to get spares.  When I went online here to get the second Nikon EN-EL14 battery, there was a shortage. EN-EL14 fits and is made specifically for the Nikon D3100, D3200, D5100, COOLPIX P7000 and COOLPIX P7100 digital cameras.  I did find a genuine Nikon EN-EL14 battery for close to Nikon's suggested SRP of about forty bucks, but you have to dig.  There are additional issues dealing with these Li-Ion batteries, and I keep the info updated in the comments to my review of the Nikon EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery. In any case, don't waste your money on clone or third-party batteries for this camera.Summary:The P7100 is the type of compact digital camera that you may want to spend a little time getting used to, and maybe even a couple of hours getting into the manual reading how to get the most from it.  The images straight from the camera look quite, with excellent details, bright colors, and very good performance at both the wide angle (28mm) and telephoto (200mm) settings, with surprisingly low noise. This is a highly-recommended 5-star compact digital camera worthy of the Nikon name. Prices keep trickling down on this model, and if you can get it for under $300, don't hesitate; grab it. You'll be glad that you did.6/20/2012", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "P7100 - Nicely Done", "Author": "Subjectively Speaking", "ReviewID": "R1VT5VG7DO3BJJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a very experienced and knowledgeable photographer, but it's now how I make my living. I normally use a Nikon D3s. That monster wonderfully serves its purpose as Nikon's top-of-the-line-do-it-all pro camera. But it's BIG and HEAVY, often causing certain non-photographers to comment, \"It must take really great pictures,\" or \"OMG, it's soooo big...\" (in response to the latter, I simply deepen my voice and say, \"Why, thank you.\"). I wanted a small camera as an alternative to carrying the D3s to family functions and other snapshot-worthy occasions, and which I can easily take everywhere and put in a coat pocket. After several days with the camera so far, I think the image quality is excellent, and I'm impressed with the features and and configuration options of the P7100. The camera produces sharp, saturated, properly exposed pictures right out of the box in full Auto mode, but also has the traditional Nikon P S A and M modes. Menu options are easy to understand and configure by just playing around with them. It's not rocket science. The camera shoots Raw images, so you can edit, tweak and improve them in Nikon's Capture NX2 or Adobe Lightroom.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the P7100's performance. It fulfills the purposes for which I got it admirably. Yes, it's rather pricey for a camera of this size, but its very feature-rich. Overall, I'm very satisfied. And it's a fly-weight compared to a pro DSLR. Nicely done, Nikon.

It can not tangle with DSLRs of course, but that is to be expected given its smaller sensor.That said, the photo quality is pretty good. I was pretty pleased with the results when I took the camera out on a recent hike. Sharpness is good, detail is good. I think the color saturation is maybe pushed just a tad more than I like, but, that is something that can certainly be changed in the camera. ISO performance is pretty decent up to 800. JPEGS are pretty good although it is almost always advised to shoot RAW when you can.Performance overall is pretty good. Maybe not as good overall as the Olympus XZ-1 but it's faster than the Canon G12 in almost everything. But, relatively speaking, for this class of camera it has a pretty good showing performance-wise.The camera has a lot of features loaded into it. The menu system navigation and the way which you adjust settings is just okay. My preference is towards Canon when it comes to this. BUT that sort of thing is a bit subjective. I am kind of a simpleton when it comes to things like this and don't like digging through the settings to access certain features. As I always say, to understand all this camera is capable of, it's best to read the manual. But the menu system wasn't such an annoyance as to overall hamper my shooting experience, once I got the feel for where everything was.There are some other aspects to the design which I really like. I really like that they put the exposure compensation as a physical dial on the camera. It would be really nice if they also put an ISO dial like on the G12. But there is also is another dial which is for navigating the most common shooting functions. I also especially like that you have three customizable dials on the camera.I like that Nikon has increased the zoom range on this camera to a 7x. That could be a make or break factor for a lot of people when deciding between this and the Canon G12. As that little bit of extra zoom range comes in handy. The LCD screen on back is pretty good. Although it has issues in bright sunlight like a lot of them do. The viewfinder is really not that great but it can be useful in cases when the LCD is not viewable.The camera is also very comfortable to shoot with. With a nice rubberized grip on the front of back. The build quality is pretty good. Although, admittedly, the G12 feels a little more solid. But is certainly a step-up from most point and shoots. It comes with a nice chunky battery. Battery life is pretty good on this camera overall.So, overall, I think the Nikon P7100 is a nice camera. It is perfect for the hobbyist photographer or student who wants nice photo quality on a budget, and lots of controls, but doesn't want to spend money on an ILC or DSLR and its associated lenses.The camera now retails for $450. If you have $450 to spend on a camera.... this is a solid choice. But.... I would also check out or maybe even try the Olympus XZ-1 before committing to the Nikon. The XZ-1 does not have the amount of controls the Nikon does and has a number of annoyances of its own. But, in terms of photo quality, at least in my opinion... it is the one to beat in the sub-$500 price range (for fixed-lens compacts anyway).", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent go-anywhere camera!", "Author": "Michael M.

The P7000 reportedly had some issues that kept many folks from loving the camera. But the 7100 seems to have addressed all the issues, and it is a wonderful camera. I own a Canon PowerShot G11 and a Panasonic Lumix LX5, and the Nikon scores points with a longer reaching lens and a great LCD display. The lens starts at 28 mm--not as wide as the Panny, and the LCD cannot be flipped 180 degrees for self portraits as on the G11. The Panny has a shorter reach but faster lens.Photos taken with the P7100 show nice detail and when RAW photos are post-processed, the results are impressive. You will be able to print 8.5 x 11 nicely (and even 13 x 19 when needed). Shot-to-shot time is acceptible, and the optical viewfinder, though primitive, saves the day in bright, direct sunlight.The Nikon P7100 feels solid and substantial, and though slightly larger than the G11, it is a superb camera to carry around all day for travel, sightseeing and the like. I have relegated my G11 to backup status and the Nikon CoolPix P7100 is now my carry everywhere camera.

With the new P7100 just released and with Nikons claiming numerous improvements, I figured I'd give it a try and let my wife enjoy the P7000. The older model had several issues: autofocus didn't work well when focusing close and periodically the camera would have a nervous breakdown. The later could be solved by removing the battery then reinstalling it. I've never really noticed slow RAW file write speed because I rarely shoot rapid sequences of images. The P7100 seems to have resolved all the issues of the P7000 with a number of improvements including: the new sub-command dial, more logical menu system, and the tilting LCD monitor. While I like the articulated LCD monitor of my Canon A630 (same as the G12), the P7100 up or down tilt does most of what I want. As with the P7000, the P7100 image quality is excellent producing sharp, well balanced color images.The P7100 may be a little large for some people and if your shooting action sequences like kids or pets at play, this camera may not be the best choice.A few reviewers have complained about the lack of a paper manual for this camera. While I also prefer a paper manual, I'm not surprised Nikon moved to a PDF version on disk, most of their competitors have already gone that route. Like it or not it's the trend with all technology. To those individual who complain about poor image quality I would respectfully suggest that either you're camera is defective, you're computer and software isn't properly profiled or it's the photographer.

This camera also has many quick settings that your family can also use along with scene selections making photography a much more enjoyable experience. Mu daughters love taking photos with it.I tend to enjoy using Program mode or aperture priority as the camera does a good job at adjusting the remainder of settings pretty well. You can go full manual as well for that \"take control\" opportunity where creativity is only limited by what you imagine.I love this camera, the video also works very well and I have found microphone also picks up well as I have taken a few video clips for my kids highschool band concerts in low light, sports events etc. and it does very well at that also.

First, it's reasonably compact, with a built-in retractable lens. It will fit in a jacket pocket, and with the nice Nikon shoulder strap (included) it's pretty light and small to wear on your shoulder by your side.2nd, it has a larger sensor than most point 'n shoot cameras, almost 75% larger! Because of the larger sensor, the image quality and low-light performance are very good, much better than your average point 'n shoot. So, by comparison, even though the Nikon P310 (a smaller camera with a smaller sensor) has a larger \"fast\" aperture of F1.8 (versus F2.8 on the P7100), the P7100 has just as good if not better low-light performance than the nominally faster P3100. You can get away without using a flash for most inside shots. And the P7100 does have a built-in flash which works well.3rd, it has a more powerful zoom lens than its competitors with the same size sensor (Canon G12, Panasonic LX-5, Olympus XZ-1). This was the deciding factor for me. The similar but more expensive Canon G12 has a 5x zoom lens, but the Nikon P7100 has 7.1x, for significantly better zoom capability. Any DSLR or interchangeable-lens-camera with equivalent zoom capability would be much larger.4th, it's very customizable with lots of control over settings. This camera is covered with knobs, dials, buttons, and levers! It's pretty confusing at first, but you can also just use the \"auto\" or \"P\" setting and let the camera adjust itself. I recommend David Busch's Nikon Coolpix P7100 Guide to Digital Photography for learning how to use all its settings.I've had some problems getting the distortion control to work when the dial is set to \"auto\" but it seems to be working now.Finally, it has an optical viewfinder--an increasingly rare feature these days! The optical viewfinder is very handy when sunlight makes the LCD screen unviewable, or when you need to turn off the LCD screen to save power. The viewfinder is pretty small, but works fine in a pinch.A good case is the Lowepro Apex 60 AW (Black). The camera with strap fits snugly inside, and there is also room for a extra battery and SDHC card.

Gable \"Nikon Nerd\"", "ReviewID": "R1JZMFLIEEOARA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently own a Nikon D7000 DSLR and a Canon S90 point and shoot.  Yes, there is a theme here as to the camera functions I like to use.  I've been making an effort to learn the ins and outs of my D7k and enjoying photography.  This led me to purchasing the Canon S90 which had some of the functions of a DSLR, but compact in size.  Though I really enjoy this point and shoot function and features, I have found that the camera is really too small for me to use.  My S90's primary use (along with an underwater case) is now for underwater photography.I was spoiled with the S90 and having the capability to take a small size camera everywhere I went.  This led me into looking for another camera that was not quite a DSLR and not quite a compact point and shoot camera.  I researched different camera models and read many reviews.  I also perused camera forums for opinions, suggestions and searched for sample pictures straight out of the cameras.  What I was looking for was what they called a \"bridge camera\".The results of my research led me to the Coolpix P7100.  There were a few positives which led me to purchasing this bridge camera.  The accessory/hot shoe enables me to use my existing Nikon speedlights with this P7100.  The infrared receivers that are located in the front and back of the camera allows me to use my existing Nikon remote control.  The optical viewfinder was a nice feature to have though not a necessity for me.  The P7100 is still a point and shoot because of its fixed lens.  The focal length, 28-200mm is a great feature as I'm used to using my Nikkor 18-200mm lens on my D7k.  So, having a decent zoom was a requirement.Besides the P, S, A, and M function on the mode dial, there are other features like image quality, ISO, WB, bracketing and other control settings that are available on a separate quick menu dial.  What can be set on the quick menu dial can also be set in the camera's menu.  Also, there's a sub-command dial for setting the apertures and a dial for setting the exposure compensation.  Really cool features on this camera.The menu is intuitive.  I spent a few minutes going through each tab and then I was able to find my way around the settings and made a few changes.  Most of the default settings I kept so I could see how the camera functions without too much tweaking.My initial battery charge took about an hour and twenty minutes to complete.  I've taken over 200 pictures and still on the first battery charge.  I've spent lots of time viewing the LCD and taken several pictures with the built in flash.  I'm looking forward to seeing how many pictures I can take on a single charge.My initial outdoor shots were awesome.  I started in Aperture mode, ISO 100, Auto AF, and Auto WB.  I was happy with those results.  WB is somewhat accurate most of the time.  My outdoor pictures are sharp and I'm amazed that I don't have to do any serious post-production (PP) edits to my pictures. My P7100 is that good.Typically, the internal built-in flash on cameras are not that great.  I used my compact SB-400 flash with this camera and I immediately fell in love with this combination.  It felt well balanced and comfortable in my hand.  This winning combination also produces beautiful pictures.I've only had this camera for less than two days and it's getting a good workout.  I will be back to post updates and tips that I uncover.  Stay tuned!**  Update 05/27/12  **I've included two shots in the gallery (blue hydrangea and white Stewartia flower) taken with my new P7100 and SB-400 flash.  The picture quality is outstanding.  I believe they ended up on page 3 in the gallery.  Enjoy!**  Update 05/27/12  **I've been researching cases and bags for this camera.  I didn't want to use a snug case since I've attached the included Nikon strap onto my camera and there wouldn't be any room to place the straps inside the case.  There are not too many cases available and the next step up would be a bag.  I was looking for a case to protect the camera and that I could throw in my purse.  I knew I would not be able to find a slim case and I was avoiding cases with large \"handles\".I came across the Case Logic Compact Camcorder Case (DCB-303) at my local Staples.  This bag is also available here on Amazon.  I took my camera with me to Staples and tried it in several cases and bags.  This was the best case for my use.  I can even fold my camera strap and tuck it inside the bag.  There are two side zippered pockets to store a small SDHC card reader, a thumb drive, and a cleaning cloth.  There's a small zipper compartment inside the top part of the bag to store a media card.This case can be worn at the waist and attached to a belt.  There's also an adjustable web strap where the bag can be worn as a shoulder bag.I've noticed that a few \"camcorder\" cases would fit this camera.  It depends on what you are looking for (functionality and size).**  Update 05/28/12  **I've been switching between the LCD and OVF for taking pictures.  Coming from the DSLR world, I thought I would rely heavily on the OVF.  So far, it hasn't been the case.  While in macro mode, the OVR is useless and have to rely on the LCD to compose the shot.  Once I switch out of macro mode, the OVF can be used if needed.I'm enjoying the tilting LCD screen.  Being a petite person, I can tilt the LCD screen down, raise my camera over my head, and take a great picture from a \"taller person\" perspective.  I've added another hydrangea picture (with a moth) to the gallery.**  Update 06/02/12  **I've added another picture to the gallery (page 3):  raspberries, blueberries and cherries.  I took this picture in micro mode and used my compact SB-400 flash.  I placed a tall white mug two inches behind the bowl of fruit.  I flipped up the flash on my SB-400 so I could bounce the flash off the white mug and back onto the fruit.  Playing with creativity.**  Update 06/03/12  **I purchased a second/backup battery from my local Best Buy.  I was finally able to use my rewards coupon.  The battery took 1-1/2 hours to charge.  I placed the extra battery at the bottom of my Case Logic case and the P7100 sits on top.  I'm still able to zip the bag shut.  I have to be careful when I remove or put the camera bag in the case that the battery doesn't fall out.  Not a big issue.**  Update 06/09/12  **My initial battery charge lasted 375 pictures!  That's a big WOW for me.  I took a lot of pictures both indoors and outdoors until the battery drained and the camera shut itself down.  I would estimate that I used the built-in flash for about 20% of the pictures I took.  Mostly experimenting with what the flash can do.  Another 30% of the time, I used my compact SB-400 speed light with the camera.  The remaining 50% of the time was used with no flash.I used the LCD a lot of the time to take the picture, review the pictures and to make changes between flash/no flash, normal and micro, experimenting with the autofocus points, and just enjoying what I was seeing on the screen.  I would have expected the LCD to drain the battery quickly, but that doesn't appear to be the case.**  Update 06/14/12  **Did I mention how much I'm enjoying this camera?  I'm so happy to have a nifty P&S; camera in my bag with me all the time.  I've posted a picture of a turkey on page 3 of the gallery.  It was taken in the late afternoon.  Notice the details.

The exceptions for ISO settings is the most glaring example.  When setting long exposures, it's normal to use higher ISO settings, yet mysteriously, Nikon limits longer exposures to 400 ISO or less.  High ISOs are usable only when the shutter is set for fractions of a second.  D-lighting also controlsThe lens is great, offering a wide zoom range with clear shots and little distortion.  It also zooms, focuses, and deploys at a good pace and I was rarely left impatient as it shifted.The tilt screen is very handy, though it only moves up and down.

The color and clarity are something I never experienced with past point and shoot cameras I have had and it really took me by surprise. I'm not a professional but I spend a lot of time travelling around Europe and I really enjoy photography and capturing all the wonderful sights I come across. This camera has a tilting digital display which only tilts up and down which is perfect for those shots where you're in a crowd and want to hold it up over your head to get past all the obstacles. The virtual level is also amazing for this to ensure you don't end up with a crooked photo. It's also handy for those low shots where you hold the cam down at ground level and are still able to see the display. This camera also comes with a great Panorama function which works very well with the AE-L/ AF-L to keep the focusing locked for a steady exposure. Also... RAW FILES !!!!!!!!  nuff said there.  The coolpix 7100 also comes with a full arsenal of effect presets from monochromatic,  cross processing, color filter!!!, zoom exposures, HDR, and many more. It takes 720p HD video, a full set of presets which are on the dial along with 3 Fn buttons for customized presets.  I will say that this camera has a LOT of rotating dials which can be intimidating at first  one of them is redundant just for aesthetics but give it a few days, learn to use the camera and you will be very pleased at how every setting you want is available at the click of a dial.

It just feels more comfortable.  Doubtless, I'm no spring chicken, and years on a manual SLR develops a strong habit.  Even so, there's a performance element involved here.So most of the professional reviews berate Nikon for keeping it on the camera.  Makes it too \"chunky\".  Maybe it doesn't fit into your jean's pocket, but the size and weight are very comfortable.  The reviews complain that you only see 80% of the captured image.  Well, if 100% composition is important, by all means consult the LCD.  No problem.  But for relatively efficient framing and shots, you just got to hit the auto zoom to where you got what you want, center it and snap.  Perfection can be adjusted and cropped afterwards.The only issue I had was being sure that what was centered was in focus.  The autofocus is sophisticated, but can let you down in a slightly crowded scene.  This is where I found adjusting from \"medium\" to \"spot\" focus made all the difference in the world using the optical viewfinder.  You don't have to worry about losing what you want in focus to a more complicated algorithm.  (And of course, there is no problem centering on what you want, reframing and getting the composition you're looking for.)Add a solid metal body, superior lens, generous telephoto, and a wealth of controls, and you got just about all the camera you could use this side of \"Blow Up\".

I took side-by-side images and could not tell a difference in the image quality.  Since I hike a lot with my dog, I don't like to carry a bulky DSLR around with me, which is the main reason I bought this camera.  Well,  after about a month of owning this camera I actually sold my D5100 because it wasn't being used at all!This camera isn't smallish, where you can put in your jeans pocket, but it can be easily carried in a coat pocket or purse.  It's easy to always have with you, which is important to me in a camera.  I know a couple of professionals who use this as their walkaround camera as well.  I've never heard anything but great things about this!If you are someone who always shoots on auto mode all the time, you probably won't appreciate how many of the controls are on the exterior of this camera vs. having to scroll through the menu on the LCD.  I for one, LOVE this about the camera.  This camera is good for so many different kinds of people.  First, it can be a great backup to your DSLR.  Second, it's a great camera to learn on to get yourself out of shooting on auto all the time and learn all the manual controls before going up to a DSLR if that is what you're looking to do.  If you are just going to shoot on auto mode all the time, this probably isn't the camera for you as you would probably desire something smaller in size.So, for the past two months I've taken skyline shots in Chicago at night, sunsets and sunrises along the beach, hiking in the mountains and along with a few waterfalls.  It's done a fantastic job!  Now, for me personally - waterfalls is where I actually do miss my DSLR as the aperture can only go down to F8 on this camera.  I would prefer it go down to like F22.  But, if the conditions are where it's totally cloudy and you use the built-in ND filter, you can actually still get some great waterfall shots where the water is blurred.  I've uploaded a couple pics on here that I have recently taken.Macro mode is also excellent on this camera.  I shoot a lot of flowers and it does perfect. I really appreciate the flip-out and movable LCD screen when doing macro!Last weekend I went out shooting with someone who had a Canon SX130.

I had several reasons for choosing this camera:  Because of the crispness of the photos of an earlier nikon coolpix, 2) because it has the options of using autofocus or manual, 3) the optical viewfinder (a must for steady shots), and 4) the 28-200 telephoto lens.  I have had this camera for two months, and I am surprised by how easy it is to use.  The pictures are very crisp.  The video is exactly as I witnessed the event and the quality of the sound is stunningly clear.  I enjoy nature photography.  I have made my first videos of the river, and the sounds of water riffling and falling in the river is a delight.  I didn't even think I would use the video portion of this camera when I purchased it.  The on-line manual and printed guide to its many features are written very clearly.  Sometimes when you purchase an electronics item that was made in Japan, the manuals are often written in Japanese and then translated.

I needed assistance from Apple to figure out how to import videos, but now that I have, I can't wait to become a nature videographer.I purchased this from Amazon.

My old Cool Pix 7900 was a real workhorse and a compact alternative to my Nikon DSLR. When the battery door latch broke (after about 5 years), I started shopping for another point-and-shoot Nikon for those times when bringing the DSLR is not practical-- hiking, camping, clubbing, partying, you know.I was really disappointed in the under $200 Cool Pix cameras because they seemed so cheaply made, and they had very few on-camera controls. I looked at the Nikon One, the S9300, and the P7100. I purchased the latter two to compare them. Due to sales and discounts, they were about the same price, but the capabilities are dramatically different. Other reviews of the S9300 said the photos were mushy in the telephoto mode and at higher ISOs. This was exactly my experience. The S9300 was not as good as my old 7mp Cool Pix and, of course, couldn't touch the D60. Another feature that I didn't like was the camera choosing the best photo. Both the Nikon One and the S9300 shoot multiple versions of the same photo simultaneously, and the camera chooses the best photo. I took a low light photo of my dog without the flash, and the photo turned out pretty good, kind of dreamy. An hour glass appeared on the screen and then that dreamy, low-light photo was replaced with a washed out, flash-style photo in which the dog had red eye! Sorry, Nikon, that was NOT the best version of the shot.The P7100 is awesome, though compared to the S9300 or my old Cool Pix. I tested it in night time shots, and it performed wonderfully. Using the back-light setting, I took photos at a daytime Easter party with very difficult lighting challenges-- some people in shade and others backlit. Great shots. The photos are very sharp; the large viewing screen is very clear; the tilt on the screen is handy. The camera has many on-camera controls (so you don't have to fish through on-screen options to change settings, although there are additional on-screen choices.) There are lots of options to be creative-- including the Manual shooting, Aperture priority, Shutter priority, Program mode, and user defined modes.

I'm not going into all the details here, but after reading reviews and coming back to read them again here and elsewhere, I can only conclude that my camera is defective.  It has always had focusing issues no matter what settings I choose.  The only shots I've taken in the 1500-2000 so far which are in focus are accidental I believe; the subject was moving and just so happened to get into a random focusing range.I recently had a pro photographer who is a 30 year newspaper photographer try it out, and he said it definitely has focus issues.  He is a Nikon guy, and at first look he thought I brought a great camera on my vacation.  He thought maybe I hadn't played with the ISO and exposure settings enough, which I had, and then was completely unimpressed after taking pictures of an eagle sitting in a tree about 20 feet away.  Those pics should have been amazing, and they were crappy like all the rest.  I give up - hopefully my warranty plan will cover it when I drop it to its death on some Alaskan sharp beach rocks.From what I've read, if you have this camera without defects and spend some time learning it, it can be a great one. Mine has never been, and my disappointment in what I thought my ability to take good pics (which I've been doing for over 30 yrs) had completely dampened my interest in photography.  Many times I was tempted to write a terrible review, but now all I can say is that I have one that isn't properly made. Focusing is not the only issue, but it's the worst one.

Williams", "ReviewID": "R2H6N31S20VZS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has been on the market now for nearly 2 years so it's probably a little late to write a review.  A newer model is due out now any day, But since I just recently purchased a copy, I'll give it a try.  For starters, it's great looking.  All those buttons and dials give it that \"serious camera\" look.  It's small, but not so small that it might slip from my hands easily.  It has a pretty good zomm; 28-200 so it has a longer reach than many compact cameras.  I love the optical viewfinder.  It's not the greatest, however, I just can't seem to frame photos using only the LCD.  The LCD is big and the 920,000 dots give great resolution when reviewing shots.  In operation, the menus are easily navigated though most of the common changes I make are accessably thru the buttons and dials.  My shots are mostly in focus and correctly exposed using the P mode.  Which is the mode most of us actually use on these compacts.  The instruction manual is on CD which is a pain when in the field to refer to.  I don't know why Nikon and other camera manufacturers have gotten away from the paper ones.  That sometimes is a deal breaker for me.  Fortunately, for this model, there are aftermarket guides that are even better than the camera manufacturer's manual for this model.  I purchased the one by Jon Sparks, available here on Amazon.  It's very comprehensive and you can pack it along with you on trips.  There are leather cases available to for the P7100.  I'm not planing on buying one just yet, but may in the future.  The lens on the P7100 is a fairly nice one, in that the maximum aperture opens to f 2.8 which is good for portrait work. The 7x zoom range covers a wide range of subject types you can photograph. From flower shots in macro mode to Grand Canyon  vistas and safari animal keepers. Nikon is reknown for the optical quality of their lenses.  So flare and distortion are things of the past.  Listed below are points that I like and those that I think need improvement:PROS:  1. Great looks!  2. Lots of buttons, dials and functions that keep you from diving into the menu.  3. 7x zoom range  4. Fast f 2.8 apeture.  5. Optical viewfinder.  6. Great ergonomics.  7. Large 92,000 dot LCD.  8. No Shutter lag.  9. Hot Shoe for speedlights.  CONS:  1. Tilting LCD.  A swivel articulating one would be better.  And is good  for  better  LCD protection.  2. The optical viewfinder could be larger and brighter with an info readout.  3. I really would like to see a manual zoom on this camera.  It's quicker and uses less battery power.  4. The lens should be able to take a polarizing or uv filter for better lens protection.  5. I know I'm asking for the moon, but I'd like to see a metal case.  Taken as a whole, I like this camera very much.  It more than meets my needs as a compact camera.  No, it's not a DSLR and won't replace one.

For the most part it takes consistently good pictures, but this review will highlight \"weaknesses\" for reader's benefits.It takes photos almost as sharp as the Canon DSLR with kit lens, but in most instances I couldn't tell if the quality was much more better than the Lumix and Canon A610 (which capture very good images in their own right, but not supposed to be in the P7100's class) The shutter lag is very short except when using red-eye reduction, but is no way as fast as even a basic DSLR though.Close-up shots are not its strength. I tried taking pix of fish in my aquarium and it was difficult to get a good shot. Close-up video is even tougher. The video focuses kind of slow compared to the Lumix. Not too good for sports I would guess. Video quality is decent though at 720p. It isn't a mega-zoom but 7.1x is good enough for most of my shots. Shooting at the widest angle, you are going to get noticeable distortion. I was surprised at the fish-eyeing you get. (to avoid it I just zoom slightly in). I will try to upload an example of this.The array of buttons/dials are good in theory; they let you have multiple avenues to control things like ISO. And you don't have to dive into layers of menus, which I hate. But I still don't have a good grasp at how to use them.

As a side note, I ruled out the ILC cameras early because I didn't see the need to carry extra lenses when the P7100 and G12 have 28-200mm range.The good. Build quality is sturdy. I like the size and feel more comfortable carrying this around than a large SLR in public settings. Image quality is very good when the subject is composed. The macro capability rivals my DSLR with a dedicated 60mm macro lens. The dynamic lighting option is very cool. It creates a semi-HDR composite in-camera. One example is taking a photo from indoors with a bright window in frame. D-lighting takes exposures for both the exterior and the interior lighting and creates an image that is well exposed for both. I didn't think I'd use the swivel screen as much as I do. Especially for macro shots or shooting from a low vantage point it works great. The camera has lots of physical controls, which will appeal to SLR users and the menus are fairly easy to navigate. I went through the online manual once and haven't had to refer to it since.Why I still will use my SLR. Focus on moving targets is tough. You can fully release the shutter without waiting for focus lock, but it takes some getting used to. If you wait for focus lock, the subject likely has moved. Burst mode works ok, but still not as fast as an SLR. With picture review on, it takes 2-3 seconds before you can take the next shot. More familiarity and customization of the settings may alleviate some of this.Overall the image quality is very good for composed shots. The scene modes work pretty well although RAW capture is disabled when using one of the scene modes.

While my specialty is landscape and wildlife, I occasionally dabble in wild life of another sort - people being people - they CAN be interesting.  When I find my way through the hidden paths of the mall, like The Americana in Glendale Ca. , I find all sort of species - Dapper gentlemen, slobs, homeless and the well homed.  But I seem to cause a strange response when I produce my favorite camera, a Nikon D300s with a 28 to 105 mm lens, I either get goofy grins and poses or a request to sign model releases.  Neither is conducive to my desire to capture folks being themselves.I have a Panasonic DMC-ZS5, a fairly good camera for my purpose.  But that chip in the front lens element limits what I can do.  So I looked and read, and came up with my Nikon Coolpix ( dumb name) P7100.  Now, realize that I'm an \"old guy\", well, old school at least and still like an eye level viewfinder.  The P7700 would have been a better choice, except it didn't have an eye level viewfinder.  AND the 7100 has a hot shoe for my SB-400 strobe ( a MARVELOUS addition to this camera.).  The zoom range is perfect for my uses, 10.1 MP is sufficient for great 11 x 14 prints, and the lens is reasonably sharp.  The autofocus is slow, so be patient.  I am retired so time is irrelevant.  The controls, ah, the controls.  Very much the same as my D300 giving me nearly the same control.  Photography is painting with light.  If you don't understand light and shoot willy silly, then snapshots are what you will get.  Nothing wrong with snapshots - literally millions are produced every day with camera phones and $100 pocket cams.  Perfect.  But not for me, so to be able to control the exposure of the subject as I can with the P7100 works for me, AND, I might add gives new meaning to the \"Delete\" key.  Many shots just are done wrong, my error - NOT the camera.As  I become more familiar with this camera I like it more and more.  By the way, I went to Home Depot and bought a small \"Husky\" brand belt clip tool carrier for my P7100, my cell phone, a pen, post it notes and ID.  I measures 5\" x 6\" and is perfect, even when hiking the few trails around my home.Finally, to whom would I reccommend this camera? NOT to the casual shooter, but to the photographer who wants to back up his shooting suite, to the serious photographer who wants a small, capable camera to carry while hiking, whether through the local Mall or the trails of Grand Canyon.

I had a point and shoot camera and always wanted to upgrade to take better pictures and have a little more creative freedom with my picture taking. I did want a DSRL camera (and I will eventually upgrade to that one day) but I hate the thought of carrying a bulky camera around when I travel. So I decided to compromise for a compact digital camera, which I feel this one is in between your point and shoot and your DSRL camera.

It is a little bulky but it is expected - I love the features (effects) {fisheye, cross process, creative monochrome}; I usually use those features after I upload my pictures to give them effects but I do like that I can do these on the camera itself. I don't mind the pop up flash, I just forget to press it down when I am done, I guess I have to get use to that.I'll be travelling next week, and I can't wait to really put this camera to use!Just get yourself at least a 4GB SD memory card, the camera does come with internal memory but I'd rather save my photos on the memory card.

Here's an early report.  Since I also have a Nikon S9100 pocket camera and a D5000 SLR, I'm naturally comparing my new P7100 to those.  I wanted something easier to carry and more discreet than the SLR and more capable than the S9100 (which is a very impressive camera if you're looking for an automatic pocket camera).The P7100 isn't really a pocket camera, though you could easily carry it in a generous coat pocket.  The P7100 weighs 14 ounces vs. 7.6 ounces for the S9100 and 27 ounces for the D5000 with the kit lens.  The supplied neck strap is bulky and loudly proclaims \"Nikon\".  After about a day, I switched to the wrist strap that came with the S9100 and I've found that to be quite satisfactory. Also, I started using the case I'd been using with the S9100, a Precision Design C190D.  It's a good case for the P7100 once you get rid of the camera's neck strap. This case has room for a spare battery and a memory card, not much more.  You can wear it on your belt, a great way to carry the camera.The P7100 takes excellent flash pictures using the bounce capabilities of the Nikon SB-400, leaving the S9100 in the dust.  A second important feature for me is recording RAW images.  Unlike the D5000, the P7100 uses the NRW format and my Photoshop CS4 can't accommodate it.  Support is available in CS5.  It's quick and easy, though, to convert a whole folder full of NRW's to DNG using Adobe's free DNG Converter.  The DNG files can be used with CS4 and the corresponding Adobe Camera Raw and they're about 35% smaller than the NRW's.  The P7100's automatic exposure bracketing can take three or five exposures if you want, but in steps of just one stop, so you have to take five exposures to get a range of four stops for HDR.  I can live with that, but I quickly filled up a 4GB card with just under 200 RAW files.The P7100 is remarkably full-featured.

Alas, once the camera goes into video mode, all manual control is disabled.  You get manual white balance and exposure lock, but that's not good enough.

I stated that if they would not fix it in warranty I would pay the charge under protest and let the small claims count decide whether I owed it. I said that I had already determined to where I should have the County Clerk mail the summons.  I copied and sent 16 reviews on Amazon alone which complained about this defect.  I also cited complaints on Digital Photography and other cites.Nikon emailed back and stated that if I would send the receipt, they would re-evaluate their position.  I just sent it to them.  One thing is clear.  If you do not push back, Nikon will walk all over you.  Do not let them!Many companies will fix a known defect, even if the product is out of warranty.  This is often referred to as a courtesy repair.  Nikon has just inferred in their email that they are not one of those companies.  I have one other concern.  Many complaints stated that after repairs, the lens cover began to stick again.  My camera will be out of warranty when I receive it back.  Will it just become a candidate for the landfill after less than 18 months?Beware, the P7100 is just this year's version of the P7000.
