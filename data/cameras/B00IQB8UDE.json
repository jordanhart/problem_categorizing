{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-WX350", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R2IWP2F0MX0GE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have not had this camera over a week but I can say that I am impressed with it. This is an ultra compact but full of capability. It is the perfect travel camera. It fits in a shirt pocket or pants pocket(tight jeans might be a problem). The bundle included everything you would need and them some. The pictures I have taken so far are very good and the video looks great on my 55\" flat screen! The Wi-Fi function works with NFC but you must have the Play Memories app installed on your NFC capable smartphone. Takes less than a minute once you touch the devices together to transfer an image. Also the app gives you remote control capability...very cool. Sony needs to do a better job at documentation. The included 'user manual' is but a pamphlet and does cover all the shooting modes. There is an on-line manual but how to do get at it in the field? It is not downloadable. I still need to learn what shooting modes are best for a given situation but it does have a 'Superior Intelligent' mode that does a pretty good job. Overall I am very satisfied. The durability remains to be seen.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IQB8UDE"}}
