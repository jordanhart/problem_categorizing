It is fun to use and very adaptable to any shooting situation.  I find myself shooting a lot more in Manual than I expected.  The exposure indicator on the front makes that possible to have the right shutter speed and aperture combo based on your ISO selection.  iAUTO mode does a great job for those who feel more comfortable with no adjustments.  I took about 300 shots (600 writes to a 16 GB 30MB/sec SanDisk Ultra SD card, 1 RAW and 1 High Res Jpeg at the same time) before the battery gave in.  The 3\" OLED screen is good enough to \"talk back\" to the Texas bright sun, which was one potential concern since it does not come with a viewfinder and I did not want to spend the additional money for the available optional unit.  I also recommend to buy a second battery Olympus LI-50B Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for Select Olympus Digital Cameras - Retail Packaging(http://www.amazon.com/review/RP3Y4CKKCDRCB/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm) and the following leather case COSMOS Black Leather Case Cover Bag For Olympus XZ1 XZ-1 Camera + Cosmos cable tie(http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZTHOZ11ALJ2M/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B005IJTNI8&linkCode;=&nodeID;=&tag;=).  If closer than ~2 ft to subjects, set the AF to Macro.  You will still have zoom.  In super Macro zoom is not possible, but you can take pics of bugs as close as ~ half an inch.  The camera has settings for bracketing in exposure settings and white balance.  You can also set custom settings for one mode dial position.  What a versatile, complete, fun, high quality compact camera!  Beginner or pro, this camera is great for making good shots when the DSLR has to stay at home.***INITIAL REVIEW:I just received this today, purchased it after playing with one my friend just received, really was impressed, and for $199 on Amazon it is a steal deal and a complete no-brainer!  And since I was looking for a serious compact camera that also gives me DSLR capabilities like choosing shutter speed, aperture, ISO or all...or absolutely nothing ... this is the perfect camera.  And with the fast lens from f1.8 to 2.5 over the complete zoom range, the lens is worth the $199 alone as any DSLR owner can attest to.  I am using this as my back up camera for the Nikon D7000 DSLR that I am privileged to own and used exclusively over the past 15 month ... and my cell phone (which doesn't cut it ... better than nothing, a 8MP camera cell phone).  This camera is also for those times when I simply cannot justify taking the D7000 with, which happens seldomly, but when it does, this camera fills that void beautifully.So for those who have no clue about cameras:  You cannot go wrong with this camera.  You cannot find a more simple and feature rich camera with PLENTY of quality mega pixels than this one (10 MegaPixels is enough) at such a low price.  $199 is a lot of money for many, but the quality of this camera makes the price laughable.  You will be happy you purchased it.  Buy it.  You will invite me to your family picture for this recommendation...(you don't have to)  (Note:  The current suggested retail price from Olympus for this camera is $499 as of November 2012, and rightfully so).For those who know everything about cameras:  You will agree from the lens specs alone, from knowing what Olympus produces, knowing that the image sensor is large for this compact camera (Large, High-Sensitivity 1/1.63\" CCD Sensor).  It is build of the highest quality materials targeted for a much higher price bracket.  You also will agree that the XZ-2 isn't worth $400 more.  Buy it.  You will want to send me a post card for this recommendation.This camera is very heavy due to the high quality build.  The front half shell is a type high end powder coated steel or aluminum shell while the back half shell feels like a powdercaoted surface, but it's made of a high quality plastic.All control elements are of high quality.  Easy to see.  Easy to use.  Intuitive.  You get a quick feeling for it.  The rear OLED 3\" screen is nice and the user interface is appropriate to the principal mode dial on the top right of the camera.  If you want to see all the adjustments you could adjust, then put the mode dial to 'M' (manual control) and you can dial with the rear dial/selection control through the menus (always enter the adjustments by clicking the right side of the dial where the flash symbol is; then you you can select adjustments on a symbol strip to your right and select the options on the bottom symbol strip of the display ... you'll see, it is quite intuitive).  The objective ring also lets you dial through options of the menu.  The ring's function changes also depending on the mode dial...for example mode dial on 'M' (Manual Shooting) - the objective dial controls the aperture from f1.8 to f8.0...mode dial on 'S' (Shutter Priority), the objective ring control the exposure/shutter from 1/2000 sec to 60 seconds...mode dial on 'Aperture Priority', the objective ring controls the aperture from f1.8 to 8.0 (as 'M')...mode dial on 'P' (Program auto sets aperture and exposure), the objective ring controls the ISO from ISO Auto, 100,125,160,...to 6400.  In the scene mode on the mode dial you can use the ring to select all the different scene modes.  Very easy to use.I think after a while it becomes natural to select your settings quickly and accurately, because it is very intuitive.  The user interface is really ingenious.The flash release is very fast and might scare you the first time.  You will seldom need it because of the low light capabilities of the lens.  Also to note is that the mode dial has a dedicated automated lowlight mode, where the camera is already optimized for night shots or in little light conditions.  The flash can also be metered full, 1/4, 1/16, 1/64 besides forced off, red eye reduction, normal flash.The lens cap that comes with the camera takes getting used to it.  It's magnetically held and pops off if one simply turns on the camera if you forget to take it off.  Both ways work.  There is an Olympus cap that opens up mechanically upon turning on the camera and the objective driving out to photo modeOlympus LC-63A Lens Cap for XZ-1 Digital Camera.  There are third party ones too.  I don't own it, won't need it myself.There are accessories available, like a TCON-17 teleconverter lens expanding the tele to 190mm (in 35mm comparable terms)Olympus Tcon-17 1.7x Telephoto Converter Lens.  for ~$200.  A viewfinder can plug into the hot shoe for about $250 Olympus VF-2 Electronic ViewFinder (Black).For me the accessories like the teleconverter lens and the viewfinder make no sense.  The camera costs $200.  If I NEED the eye viewfinder (which is very nice to have), I have to just use my DSLR.  It doesn't make sense to me to have this camera with a million accessories.  It takes away what I purchased it for.  It's got to be in the 'box'.  Not to mention, for $600 you can buy a DSLR these days.  My old Olympus SP-350 had one build in (that camera is for sale now, but you are better off to buy this XZ-1).The camera did not come with a SD card, so make sure you buy one.  I bought a SanDisk Ultra 16GB which has a transfer rate of 30MB/sec which is plenty.  Don't stick a crappy low end SD card into the camera.  It will take away from the speed of this camera (or any camera when writing to the chip).  Use 15MB/sec min, 30MB max.  45 MB/sec (San Disk Extreme) is overkill.  It's inexpensive 'film'.  With 16 GB you can shoot over 1300 RAW pictures (uncompressed pictures) or more than 2770 10MP fine JPEGs (1/4 compression rate).  In other words, plenty of pics.  Or you can record RAW and JPEG at the same time (~890 shots).  NICE!The first pictures I took are incredible.  Look at flickr.com/groups/xz1/ for pics XZ-1 owners took.  Low light pictures are amazing without flash.  At ISO6400 the camera behaves just like film would.  It's incredible one can take pictures with this camera at that sensitivity.This camera is amazing.  It's fun.  It's real quality.  It is unique from the design.  The user interface is well thought through, the controls are first class.  It's ideal for the beginner with the potential to grow and become a better photographer the easy way.  It's a serious camera for professionals when one cannot take that DSLR or doesn't want to.It takes HD video too, but if you want video, buy a video camera.  Don't expect this to be a video camera.

This XZ-1 will be my new companion for a long time to give me the best non-DSLR option.And yes, the XZ-2 is not worth $450 more.  For that advice you can give me half of the difference and I invite you to a beer.Here are the complete specs for your convenience from Olympus for those who know what they are looking for.

Here's what I found with mine:1) Auto-focus on video is pretty much unusable.  You get random focus jumps during the video even when you and your subject are barely moving.  I tried all sorts of settings changes to deal with this, but I found none that work reliably (except manual focus).This is not as bad as I thought it would be.  I find that most of the videos I take are short and don't require focus adjust.  But it does require you to switch between auto for stills and manual for video.  Kind of defeats the purpose of having a dedicated video button.  I find I some times mess up when switching and wind up taking stills in manual focus, or getting a random bad video.  Seems to me that Olympus must know the auto focus is hosed.  Why not make video manual-only?  Or at least give a menu option to set that up?2) You get some vertical lines on the video and while in 'preview' if you have a bright light source in the frame.  They do not show up in the still pics though.  It's not outrageously bad, and other cameras have the same issue, but I figured I'd point it out.So short answer is if you must have great video look elsewhere (try maybe the Panasonic LX5?).  The XZ1 video is good enough for me to use when I HAVE to have a video, but that's about it.But the stills on the XZ1 camera are fantastic.  It really shines when taking pictures of kids indoors with so-so lighting and no flash.  And if you like taking close ups of flowers, prepare to be amazed.  I got some amazingly crisp shots just pointing and clicking in full auto mode.For me the kicker that got me to buy the XZ1 over the LX5 was the cheap underwater case available for it:Olympus  PT-050 Under Water Housing for Xz-1 Digital CameraI'm dying to take it underwater.  Maybe I'll post some pics when I do.Some odds and ends:- The XZ1 doesn't come with an external battery charger, so you need to charge the battery in the camera.  That is unless you buy one of these for like 5 bux.  It works just fine and so cheap.  And generic replacement batteries are available on Amazon for cheap.  Haven't needed one yet, but I may get one before I go on vacation.Premium Battery Charger with Car Charger Adapter for Olympus LI-50B Digital Camera & CamcorderHigh Capacity LI-50B Replacement Lithium-Ion Battery for Olympus Stylus Tough 8000, 6000, 1030 SW, 9000, 1010, 1020 Digital Camera- The lens cap is a bit annoying if you are not used to the removable type caps.  I was considering buying one of those auto-retract ones, but I don't want to add bulk to the camera.  Instead I just attach the cap to the camera with the included lanyard.  It pops off when the lens comes out.Edit 5/27/2012 - Here's some thoughts after using for a few months:I'm really liking the full-auto mode more than I ever thought possible.  Unless I'm doing something very unusual, I'll use this mode for all my stills.  Even for macro shots it works really good.  It's great to go hiking and be able to stop for 10-15 sec and still get a decent shot of that pretty flower.  With my last camera it would be a 1-2 minute stop with me fiddling with the controls and my friends whining.  I posted one of these quickie full-auto flowers to Amazon.I've noticed that indoor low light shots have pretty poor automatic white-balancing.  You can use \"capture white balance\" to correct it, but not in \"full auto\" or \"low light\" mode which are my 2 favorite modes for taking stills.  Also this takes time to do, so mostly I don't bother.  Right now my solution is to either live with the bad white balance or if I have a real \"keeper\" shot, I'll use post processing to clean it up a bit.  The included olympus software is not half bad for stuff like this.For video I've learned a few more tricks to deal with it, but it's still not ideal.  I notice that the auto focus problems are much less severe if you are outside on a bright day, so if this is the case, I feel comfortable taking videos in full auto.  Also if I plan to do a video where I'm deliberately moving the camera a lot, I will use auto since you don't notice the focus hunting as much with lots of camera movement.  For indoors or where the camera will be still, I have my \"P mode\" on the dial set to manual focus permanently for video use.  So the steps to go from still to video are:1) switch dial to P2) Hit 'info' and adjust focus if needed3) start videoQuick, but not that quick.Edit 9/03/2012 - Finally got to try out my underwater case in Hawaii.  Unfortunately I got sand in the camera lens on day 2 of my trip, so I only got in one day of snorkeling with it.  I'm looking to get it repaired by Olympus so I'll update later on how that goes.  I added some samples to the page.  2 full frame (5mp) shots and 2 100% crops.Overall I was very pleased with the underwater pics.  Even when it was overcast and I was diving down it seemed like the shutter speed \"auto selected\" by the camera was almost always faster than 1/100, so I got very few blurry fish (unlike every other camera I've ever used).  The colors seemed to be improved with using the underwater mode vs normal auto, but I'm sure they could be better with manual white balance (which I did not try).", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "That Lens...", "Author": "D. Wray", "ReviewID": "R122XOALBC29OW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Was pretty torn between this and the Panasonic Lumix LX5, but ended up with this one because I already owned an Olympus camera that used the same battery and also had an external charger, so I'd essentially have an extra battery already.  Also, a big selling point on this camera was the lens, even though I'd have preferred the 24mm wide angle on the LX5, the depth of field you can get with the lower aperture range on the XZ-1's 28mm lens seemed better, plus the aperture was more favorable throughout the entire zoom range of the XZ-1.  After using the camera for a little while, I was very impressed at the image quality it produced.  Overall, it was a great camera, but I ended up returning it because the price dropped over 60 dollars from the time I bought it before the return window closed, and I found an LX5 for only 306 dollars from amazon warehouse deals.  It seemed to me that the difference in price was well worth whatever differences there were between the cameras, and I knew I'd prefer that 24mm lens.  However, after having the LX5 for a few days now, I cant quite reproduce the excellent image quality and depth of field I got from the XZ-1.  But, with the difference in price, I may just end up living with the LX5, it's by no means any slouch, and I think the menu system and flexibility of the options is better than the XZ-1.  And as much as people seem to love that control ring around the lens, I didnt find that I missed it at all with the adequately intuitive controls on the LX5.One last thing, be aware that the white version of the XZ-1 appears to be made with more plastic, as from what I understand, the body of the black version is metal.  So to me, the build quality of the white version wasnt as good, and as cool as I thought it looked initially, in practice, I felt like a bit of tool when using it in public and would definitely go with the black version if I were to ever purchase again.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of the best point and shoot you can buy.", "Author": "William Ng", "ReviewID": "R1CXFP0ZPW86NB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing camera.

I'm replacing a $130 point and shoot with this XZ-1 because I unfairly compare these things to my wife's Canon 5D and an old Canon SureShot I had in the $400-range that performed admirably.My primary desire in this camera was the low-light sensitivity of the lens. At 1.8, it allows me to use flash less, and stick to lower ISOs to eliminate days. Most of the pictures I take are not in the full sun - as I'm sure many of you can relate with. The camera performs pretty well at 1.8, though it is a far cry from the 1.8 85mm portrait lens on the Canon 5D (DSLR). However, it can take some comparable images with less flexibility - as is expected in this format. The key to making the best use of this capability is to use more manual settings. Full auto will result in the camera leveraging higher ISOs first so as to maintain the fastest shutter speed possible. Most people should be able to take a steady picture at 1/60 with a subject that isn't moving a great deal. The auto settings in the camera think you need 1/125 and so adjust the ISO gain accordingly.The other beaut of a feature is the built-in ND filter. You have to enable it through a menu, unfortunately, but it can be a real boon in sunnier settings where you happen to also want a larger shutter (lower fstop).The only aspect of the camera that I really don't like is the auto focus in video mode. For some reason, the video will periodically blur and refocus every 15 or 20 seconds.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Top Ten Pros and Cons", "Author": "M. Orton", "ReviewID": "R3VV2YX6I2XREE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Olympus XZ-1 for a little while now, and here are my first impressions. I'll update it later after I've had it longer.I'll go ahead and knock out the complaints first.1. The plastic body doesn't feel all too strong. I'm afraid one good drop is going to toast the body, but I try to baby my camera gear so hopefully this won't be an issue.2. Looking directly into the sun causes a weird light strip in the screen display but doesn't show up in the pictures. I was a bit freaked out the first time it happened, thinking it would show up on the capture. Luckily it doesn't at all.3. The lens cap has no real attachment to it so when you turn the camera on, the lens just falls off. I read about this issue before I bought it, so wasn't surprised, but it is still annoying. The little string to attach the cap to the camera doesn't really fix the issue either.4. I need to get used to the auto focus. It works, it just isn't as finite and accurate as my old Nikon's autofocus was. I need to utilize the easy to use and access focus settings more on it, which will come in time.5. I wish it had a wider lens on it. I am just used to the ridiculously wide 11-16mm Tokina.6. There is a bit of lag from when you take the picture to when the camera finishes imprinting the capture info to the card. The shutter button is dead on and captures when you want it to, but the computer seems to take longer in transferring the photo info to the card. I have only shot in RAW+ formats so these larger files may be the cause for this lag.7. My biggest complaint is the ORF file extension on the Olympus RAW files. It isn't compatible with my editing software so that creates a bit of a hassle for me and I have to find a solution so I can edit my shots.8. The neck strap included with the camera just isn't comfortable. A nice wrist strap would have been great.9. I wish there was a viewfinder as well as the OLED screen. There are aftermarket option but this really is just something I need to get used to10. There is no hard copy user manual. The only one that is available is though a PDF file available for download.Now onto the positives!1. It is just plain looks great. I know that doesn't really matter in the bigger scheme of things, which is why I put it first and got it out of the way, but it just looks so much nicer than the traditional pocket PAS cameras.2. The lens is spectacular for a point and shoot. It is super sharp, colors are great and it comes in a tiny little package.3. The size is just about right. It is small enough to fit in a jacket pocket, easily at that, and big enough that someone with large hands doesn't fumble around with holding it and changing the controls. It won't fit in jean pockets very well, but I really hate anything besides my keys in my pockets anyway.4. The user interface, while COMPLETELY different than anything I am used to, is super easy to learn. Within a half hour of messing around with functions I had the essentials down and more of the functions were easy to remember as well. The thumb dial is placed nicely on the rear, right where you need it, and the front dial turns easily in very distinguishable increments. The dial functions all seem very intuitive and make sense once you learn what they do and what the easiest ways to change the settings are.5. There are a ton of built-in photo editing options that are ridiculously easy to use and pretty cool to boot. The novelty of each will surely wear off, but most of them have practical editing uses to improve a shot or create the mood you are looking for on your shot. There is also a nice variety too, not the same old ones one other cameras. There are 5 or 6 ART modes and 6+ SCENE options which are all at the touch of a button or roll of a dial.6. The battery seems to last a substantial amount of time. I threw the battery in straight out of the box and was out the door to shoot and it was still full after taking almost 100 shots of anything and everything around.7. The OLED rear screen is nice and big. Like I said, I'm not used to using it strictly for setting up my shots, but the quality of the screen makes it easier to get used to.8. There are a number of file options, so many I can't remember each one, but it sure seems like there is every conceivable combination of file type out there. If you want to shoot it, it is there.9. The functions are all easy to change on the fly. There is hardly any need to go in tot he actual menu settings because all the buttons control all the functions necessary to get the shot you want. Everything is just a touch or turn away.10. The camera has all the functions of a full size DSLR in a compact package.

We've all come to like the high end point and shoot ones the best.  We have A great DSLR but it's bulky and the quality of especially enthusiasts point and shoot meets our needs, usually.  We don't own a single 4/3 camera.  Changing lens, oddly bulky like a DSLR, with only marginally smaller footprint with a good lens..makes no sense to any of us.I bought the XZ1 when the price dropped like many others a few months back.  It's a beautiful camera.  I don't like night shots in the city and the special effects filters blow up badly due to in camera processing.  This is as opposed to our Canon G12 and Panny LX5.  I have 2 pics on various walls after blowing up special effects using the G12 and the LX5.  Can't do that with the XZ1 with anything I've tried.  The G12 simply takes better pics all around.  It has a slightly larger zoom and does macro about the same.  Macro shooting is best with the LX5.  It's easiest to set and  clearly takes the best macro shots.  Hands down.So the last month or so, and two trips, the XZ1 has remained in its case.  It's not what any of us are grabbing to take shots with.  I guess in this category that's a primary driver.There is also one serious weakness with this camera if you are so inclined to use video.  Blurry, slow to focus compared to ANY point and shoot we own.  Even the camera that doesn't quite take as good pics as our others, the Canon 300HS, takes way better video than this camera.  While video isn't a priority in our family, we all spot do it and twice have done it with the XZ1 and went, \"Huh?\"I suppose if you don't have anything to compare it with, this is a satisfactory camera at a price point.  But I think I would get an LX5, used but very good, as opposed to this one.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good things and bad things mostly true", "Author": "I Live in 91607", "ReviewID": "RHRNH7Z0C6BHZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All the good things you've read about this are true. All the bad things are equally true but there's more good things than bad things about this camera. The best thing is the 1.8 lens. Astonishing in low light. I've only had it for one evening and have yet to test it in daylight but so far, indoors at night I'm getting good results. The video quality is mediocre but I didn't buy this camera for the video quality. My main reason was I HATE FLASH PICTURES!  This camera enables me to shoot really decent photos in low to moderate light and it \"sorta\" fits in my jeans....but better in a coat pocket. I wish it had a retractable lens cap but the lens cap pops off automatically when you turn the camera on. Olympus graciously included a tether strap for the lens cap.  I use those on all my lenses with my Sony A77 and don't find them annoying like some people do.  I do wish it had a separate  battery charger instead of the in-camera charging but it can also be charged via a USB port on a computer.  Nifty.  I can't tell, but I think the body is all metal which means it's heavy for a point and shoot but also feels very rugged and sturdy. THe best thing is - I got mine on sale on Amazon for $349 in early Jan. I see where they're now back ordered and some are selling for as much as $500. I guess word has gotten out that this is one of the best recent  point and shoots to hit the shelves. I say recent because at the rate these camera manufacturers pump out new cameras, the Oly XZ-1 will be obsolete faster than you can hit the \"add to cart\" button.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Best of the Best", "Author": "Rylen Hyron", "ReviewID": "R1IDLIK71ZGYE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In terms of overall specs for me this is the best of the best. If you don't believe me head on over to DP Reviews or 2 Camera Guys and check the comparisons for yourself. Colors and details are excellent. DSLR-like quality in bright to medium light with a little tweaking using the ACD See software.  Usable ISO is only up to 800 with visible noise but manageable. Low light performance is mediocre. You have to set the camera to a lower shutter speed (might want to place the compact on a tripod), setting the aperture at low as well (f1.8 - f2.5) for the lens to produce sharp images.Differences with other compacts:RX100 - expensive - might want to consider getting a 4/3rds or a NEX system rather than invest on this, no hotshoe, images are good when resized but I still prefer the colors produced by the XZ1LX5/LX7 - pales in terms of image quality, not sharp enough even if lens is at a wide of f1.4P7000/P7100 - again not sharp enough, bad in low light, XZ1 is way faster and better in low light, too big for me and looks antiqueCanon G's - too big, more expensive, slower UI, softer colors produceds100/s110 - too small for my taste to be an advance compact, colors too soft, wouldn't buy this for the looks only as it looks like an ordinary point and shootVideo is not that good. You might want to choose the other compacts (LX5/7, RX100) since this only has 720p but then for me a cameras most important asset is its image quality and this is where it shines the most. Now there is a new XZ2 which has a higher megapixel count but then upon close inspection I still find the images of the XZ1 better. In terms of price, this is still the best. Others cost like a 4/3rds, NEX system already which shouldn't be the case as those systems still produce better image quality over these.Good job Olympus! I hope that your next iteration (XZ3) should have a similar color grade to this model, 1080p 24p/60p videos, tiltable touch screen, wifi, higher MP count, better ISO performance - usable up to 6400, optical viewfinder, fastest AF, bigger grip, more external controls and a bigger sensor. :-)", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great pics on shore and under water", "Author": "Luis Paulo de A Porto", "ReviewID": "R18UY36IBDE9T8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great for this price range.
