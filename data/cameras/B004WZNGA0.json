While I love my Flip Ultra HD, the lack of still photo capability is too limiting. While overall I am pleased with the B10 there are a couple cons which I think potential buyers should consider. First the B10 has a small LED video light built in. While the light is fairly dim, it's better than nothing for recording video in a dimly lit room. As for still photos however, this same LED takes the place of a flash and fails miserably. Next, the B10's shiny finish is somewhat slippery so hold on tight while filming.  Bottom line, if you want an all around compact device for \"both\" quality video and stills, look to the \"Dual Camera\"  Xacti line from Sanyo. On the other hand, the B10 is fine for outdoor use or in brightly lit situations.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pass this one by", "Author": "James Gerber", "ReviewID": "R1ZYRATYPPR6ZE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought a refurbished Camileo B10 from Woot (an Amazon company) because, according to the specs, it could do time-lapse.  Imagine my dismay when I discovered that the camera will not operate when it is charging, and there is no way to turn off the battery-guzzling screen.  This limits any time-lapse recording to the amount of time that the camera will run before the battery runs out, which turns out to be about 3.5 hours.  The camera has been out long enough for Toshiba to fix these two issues, but they have turned a deaf ear to the many complaints that can be found on-line (including the Toshiba website).", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camileo B10 Is Nice Pocket Video Cam", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RGNKPWZ8DRBN4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had mine 3 days.  I've made a side-by-side recording comparison with my Kodak Playsport, which you can find by searching YouTube or try this link: [...].  Copy and paste it.I put both cameras on a bracket and attached the bracket to a tripod. I recorded simultaneously a busy intersection and then cut segments from each camera's total 15- minute recording. I played corresponding short segments from each one after the other, so as to give an A-B comparison.The Kodak Playsport average bitrate was 11,996 kbps, the Toshiba Camileo 9,401 kbps. The Kodak file was 1.15 GB and the Toshiba, 921.51 mb.The Kodak resolution was better, but the color and exposure on the Toshiba was superior. The Toshiba LCD was more viewable. The Kodak is waterproof, the Toshiba, not. Both have replaceable batteries and both have HDMI ports. The controls are more convenient on the Toshiba because it has separate video and still-picture buttons. With the Kodak, you must enter the menu system.I like the Camileo B10!  I've not experienced any abnormalities in the operation as have some reviewers.  Got my fingers crossed because I just ordered a spare battery for it.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wishin I didnt", "Author": "Horsin", "ReviewID": "RWQEYI1FWP0DM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought it to video horses in training. The zoom is TERRIBLE! Grainy with any amount of zoom. Powers on and off on its own, causing the battery to run down. I didn't figure out what was happening to the battery until it was too late to return it. Definitely didn't like the slick surface of the camera. Had to use stick on bling to have something to grip.

Purchased it through \"Woot\" but I don't recall that it was refurbished or anything like that.  As far as any of the \"features\" being inadequate...I don't know as the thing doesn't even work right out of the box.  I charged it...it turns on...it turns off....and if I let it sit (not very long...ten minutes maybe) it won't turn on again.  Sometimes (but not always) removing the battery seems to \"reset\" it.  I thought it might be the battery so I checked the voltage...yup...the battery is okay.  This piece of trash is going in the garbage where it belongs.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this...it's not even a deal at half...or quarter...or a tenth of the price.FWIW I did not try to deal with Toshiba customer service...as others have noted it is notoriously bad...for what I paid for this it's not worth the headache of even trying.

The price was very good and the camera does HD, so I sprung for it.Very much regret it.It was flaky, from day one, with the \"won't power on\" issue that is well documented online. Sometimes it would, sometimes it wouldn't, sometimes pulling and replacing the battery would reset it.Now, I just missed being able to record an important event because it would not power up (despite charging all day), no matter what I did. After 30 minutes of panicky troubleshooting, I had to just shoot the event on my cameraphone.

I've taken many candid photos and videos and am very pleased with the results. It is best used where there is adequate lighting but I'm not saying that it has to be super bright. I've been thinking of buying another one just to have a back up. I have many cameras of different brands. My most expensive is my old Nikon costing over $1,000.00 and my Sony digital costing over $600.00. Just for a carry around this Toshiba Camileo B10 has served me well with no disappointments.

Glad I didn't pay for it and glad she didn't pay for it.  I took only a few videos, perhaps 30 minutes worth, which were okay, but either the battery life is very short or there are other problems with the camera, as the battery goes \"dead\" within a day or so without even being turned on.  Plug it in and sometimes it charges, sometimes it doesn't.  It is now completely lifeless after several attempts to charge it, removing and reinserting battery, etc.  Testing the battery with a Fluke multimeter, the battery reads 4 volts.  But the camera does not respond.  It would be nice nice, handy little camera if it worked.

Wrong.  Started having problems almost immediately, when I called Toshiba, it was like \"oh, just take the battery out and let it reset itself to the factory settings and it will be fine.\"  Wrong again.  Sometimes it would take 3 or 4 tries to get it to reset, then it would work for a while, then quit again.  Finally, about two weeks ago it quit for good.
