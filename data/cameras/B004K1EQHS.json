{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK if your cheap", "Author": "mdrcoast", "ReviewID": "R1L9XEUE01LRRN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This system is easy to set up, just mount the camera and install the software.  Just be sure you install it on a 32 bit OS as there are no 64 bit drivers for the DVR.  I ended up pulling an old laptop and loading the software on it.  I have had to re-install the software a few times, not sure if it is the Laptop or DVR software causing the issue but since it is running on a low end laptop I wont take away points for that.If you want to run it with an external hard drive, make sure you have USB 2.0 or better as I have found that using USB 1.0 just isn't fast enough and it corrupts the files on the external drive.Images are surprisingly clear.Wireless makes for easy installation. Not running a bunch of cables is a plus. The software can be a little buggy and there is little or no customer support.If you are looking for a professional system, this is NOT for you but if you just want to watch the driveway, it will work.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$249.99", "Features": "SM-302TX camera transmits up to 100 ft without any interference from 2.4 GHz/5.8 GHz devices\nMPEG 4 video compression for better picture quality & streaming video\nEasily turns a PC into a DVR for recording & wired/wireless cameras into Internet cameras\nSupports smartphones with Win Mobile, Symbian, WIN CE, iPhone & Android OS\nSupports static IP or dynamic domain name for remote access, auto e-mail, buzzer & pre-record for any motion detection event", "Name": "Macally Securityman iCamDVR1W Single Wireless Camera System", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31AXGjiZXwL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004K1EQHS"}}
