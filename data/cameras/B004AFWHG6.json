I bought 2. One for my wife who wants to move up from point and shoot and than decided to buy one for myself. Now when she has questions i will have in hand the exact same camera that she has and it will be easier to isolate and answer her questions. No it is not a top self dslr but it is a very capable little camera and an excellent teaching platform. You can point and shoot or you can dig as deep as you want to learn the ins and outs of photography. Try it you'll like it.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good micro four thirds camera", "Author": "GG \"GG\"", "ReviewID": "R3HOFYH90DODUF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with a 14-150mm lens. It is fairly compact but not pocketable. However, it is significantly smaller than a traditional SLR. Many people would find the camera acceptable, but I found it to be too big with images not as sharp as those from compact Olympus cameras that I have owned. Some of the colors seemed a bit unnatural. It does take good pictures in low light.ProsGood low-light capabilities.Fairly compact.Single lens for wide angle and telephoto (if buying the 14-150mm lens).ConsImages not as sharp as some point-and-shoots.LCD flickers in low light.Too much color saturation in some images.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004AFWHG6"}}
