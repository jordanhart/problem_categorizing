{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Low Light Performance Plus Image Stabilization", "Author": "Todd Krieger", "ReviewID": "R1NPTFQ4SDUTAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When it comes to compact cameras, the single most-critical function in my opinion is the auto-focus mechanism.  In low-light conditions, many compact  point-and-shoot cameras have a hard time snapping the intended image into focus.  This is where the Nikon Coolpix S700 stands out.  The auto-focus consistently locks onto its target, and produces crisp images in some of the most-difficult conditions.The other part of the camera's impressive low-light performance is the image-stabilization, which also works in a manner I've not experienced before.  If the camera detects a distinctive \"line\" or \"edge\" in the image, it will adjust for shake under relatively long shutter intervals.  The best part is the camera does not have to tap into the noisy high-ISO range (or use the flash) to get good images in low light.  (The gallery link below has \"indoor night shots\" with the only light from the streetlights outside.)Other positives for the Coolpix S700 include one of the sharpest LCD displays I've seen.  So much so, unlike a lot of competitive products, one need not wait until download to the computer to find out whether or not a crisp shot was truly realized.  However, there is some sort of \"delay\" enhancement algorithm, which would necessitate the use of a high-end image handling suite (such as Photoshop Elements 6.0) to fully realize the image sharpness.Other strong points include superior color accuracy (especially with the \"vivid\" color setting), and a superb instruction manual.  The movie mode, although vanilla by modern standards, worked smoothly and adjusted well to conditions.That said, like just about every other compact, the Coolpix S700 has some \"nagging\" flaws.  Above 800 ISO, the images do get plenty noisy.  Although it rarely goes overboard with the noise reduction, which often robs images of depth.  If the low-light shot does not provide an \"edge\" for the VR image stabilization to latch onto (like a low-light photo of an abstract painting without distinctive lines), the image stabilization loses its effectiveness.  (This is where true optical stabilization is an advantage.)  The camera tends to \"overexpose\" in low light or with mostly \"dark objects\", necessitating manual exposure compensation (this also improves image stabilization due to shorter shutter interval).  The \"best shot\" modes require trial and error, and don't necessarily function as titled.  It's not intuitive like Canon products.  Although the shutter lag is virtually nil, the \"sound feedback\" does not seem to perform properly (the sole feedback is the LCD screen momentarily going blank).  The image stabilization is not so effective in \"macro\" mode.  The \"macro\" mode does not lock focus if less than 4 inches from the object.  There are almost no real manual controls: No manual focus, no aperture controls, etc..  Although not unusual for a compact, given its \"automatic\" performance capability, manual controls may have enhanced performance even further.  The intensive autofocus and BSS inflict a big hit on battery life....  Roughly 150 shots.  (A \"focus lock\" feature would have been nice.)  The flash provides an even light spread, but does not adjust well to conditions.  (Close range is too bright.)  The lack of a true settings \"selector wheel\", and instead a purely menu-driven selector requires more learning and effort for basic changes in settings.  The telescoping lens mechanism does not retract when previewing images.  (One could inadvertently smudge the lens or bump the mechanism while fixated on preview images or menu modes.)  The USB interface is rather crude, located at the bottom of the camera.  The battery cannot be charged within the camera (like with Casio models).  So with the short battery life, keeping spare batteries is almost a must.  Although the face detection works pretty well, it's not as elaborate as that of some competitors (like Canon).  As long as you're not taking pictures of crowds, it should not be an issue.  Although the camera has (barrel/pincushion) \"distortion correction\", it defeats the VR anti-shake image stabilization.  And finally, the camera does not shut off automatically while idle after transferring images to the computer- One could end up with a depleted battery if he/she forgets to turn it off manually after the transfer.  (This is not an issue when taking pictures.)The software suite is typical, with a Nikon Transfer and Kodak EasyShare, but does not possess the image enhancement algorithms that exist in the camera, and often, the images don't quite have the sharpness like on the LCD screen.  This can be rectified by using a top-end product like Adobe Photoshop, which possesses these algorithms.  (If the image on the computer initially appears soft and then snaps into focus after a few seconds, like it does on the camera's LCD screen, the software has the algorithm.)  The image gallery [...] provides sample images handled by Photoshop Elements 6.0.  The \"five star\" rating is provisional that the Photoshop suite (or comparable) is utilized.  Without the enhancement algorithms, I'd give this product four stars.Although a lot of us would like more control over shutter, aperture, and focus settings, or maybe the functional refinement of a Canon, as compact point and shoot models go, the Nikon Coolpix S700 may set a new standard for realizing crisp, low-noise images under low light conditions.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wow ! What a nice brick !", "Author": "Tom Iancu \"from east\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZR0LIAR81KZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I confess, I'm a Nikonite, but my wife has a Canon PowerShot A80 that we used some years for all our holidays. Quite a good little P&S; actually, we took a lot of photos that we enjoyed and I still believe they don't build P&Ss; like that. However, finally I decided to get her something new so I bought a Coolpix S700.Pluses:Build and controls: First thing is that the camera is very small, actually it has the size of a credit card which makes this Coolpix the perfect for small hands of ladies and teens, and as carry over inside any small purse. It is so small, light and unobtrusive that you can take everywhere with you. However, the build is quite fine, you can feel the touch and compactness of metal, no cheap plastic and no squeaks and cracks. The buttons are all well placed, respond well to moderate pressure, the selection dial works very fine and smooth. The camera gets ready very quickly from the moment you power it on and you can take a shot in apx 2-3 seconds from the moment you pressed the \"on\" button. The next thing you probably want to know is how intuitive is to use it without a manual. I know that there are a lot of people that don't read the manuals (I would recommend them to do it, though). I was pleasantly surprised by the simplicity in operation and the logic of interaction between different buttons and the selector dial. However, the graphical interface is very, very coarse and the design may deserve an \"F\" (it's utterly ugly - Nikon has a biiig time problem with software interface design). But you can use it very well and quickly, which is most important. The LCD is large but the quality of displayed image is not very good (see below). Maybe it is a good idea to get a small purse or bag for the camera or a screen protector like this.Image quality: The images are very detailed and sharp. Actually VERY sharp. Extremely sharp. Especially in macro mode (normal), but also in normal shooting, the sharpness and the resolution will give you enough details to pixel peel if you want. The overall appearance of a photograph in standard mode is less saturated which reminded me of S700's bigger brothers (nikon dSLRs) behavior in Adobe RGB color space. For some of you, boosting saturation in \"vivid\" mode will be of choice, however I did not have the time and opportunity to test \"portrait\" and other modes. For my taste: the colors are extremely natural in standard mode (the color of my cat's fur in the photos get perfect ! very good rendition of skin tones etc.) and I can hardly wait to test it under a sunny sky. I didn't play with D-lighting control. The camera benefits from the expeed processor so you'll notice very small chromatic aberrations.Flash: Flash indoor is somehow to the warm side of flash chroma, for \"night portrait\" mode and cooler for \"party/ indoors\" mode. This is normal and probably well thought. Moreover, take care when taking pictures in \"night portrait\" mode because the camera tend to lower the shutter speed to the point where the surroundings become blurry. Remember that VR modes are activated in all camera modes that use low exposure times (Night, Night Portrait, Indoors etc) which may help you down to 1/4 of a second. However, I'm not very convinced by the VR because some images where quite blurry with VR on. Either I did something wrong (I didn't read the manual, remember?), either the efficiency is not very impressive, either this is the way it should behave a P&S; VR system or - also probable - I have steady hands (remember, tripod and/ or steady hands fool any image stabilization system). I have to test it more. However, you can hear it how it works inside the camera, though, like a tiny, tiny mouse scratching inside. ;)Noise: Excellent for a P&S; up to 400, good at ISO 800, usable at 1600. 3200 is a cr@p. However, you may try it for lowlight conference shots but stick to 800 or 1600. 3200 only if you are desperate. (as a trick, you might consider exposure compensation in \"shooting mode\" when shooting at noisy ISO settings and boost the exposure a bit will lower the noise a bit).The minuses:1. It seems that the internal clock resets each time you remove the battery because it asks you whether you want to adjust time when you power on the coolpix AFTER you removed and reinserted the battery. The S700 doesn't probably have another battery for the clock or I'm doing something wrong.Update: No such thing. Probably I did something wrong because I've charged the batt many times since then and the clock didn't reset.2. Be sure to promptly release the SD card after you press it in order to remove it. The spring beneath is not very strong and you may have a hard time trying to get out the card.3. For some unknown reason, you have to insert the card and the battery facing their back sides (the contact side for the card and the opposite side of the battery label). You'll see that you'll be tempted to insert them reversed.4. The battery is held in place by a small spring-loaded plastic button that can be broken very easily if you don't take care. Take care.Update January 26, 2008 - Battery Life: Quite poor, but understandable due to its small size. Standard shooting indoors (normal temperatures) no flash may get you up to 100-150 photos (depending on VR and LCD usage). However, in cold weather I haven't manage to take more than 50 photos, which is still reduced with flash down to 30 photos. So it would probably be a good idea to buy an additional battery.5. The LCD. I think this is the biggest minus: the image on the LCD sucks. Especially in lowlight is so noisy that you can hardly see anything on the LCD. And I'm talking about a room which is lit by a 60W light bulb ! Anyway, please take my words with caution because it is the first time I'm using a P&S; 2.7\" LCD so probably this is the way it should look. Overall I was very pleased by this little wonder of technology.Update January 26, 2008 - Image quality on LCD: don't rely on the LCD to test the results. What seems to be overexposed on LCD is actually well exposed. I don't know whether Nikon has a bit to learn about proper LCDs on compacts or it is a feature and not a bug just to preserve battery life.Conclusions: Consider into buying the Coolpix S700 if you want a full-auto enabled point-and-shoot, with a lot of automatic modes, well build in metal, small to fit any delicate purse or any pocket with an excellent image quality and huge resolution for a point-and-shoot.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic! Nikon does not disappoint", "Author": "Steven F. Moore", "ReviewID": "R2PFI6E5S6ZDNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a fan of Nikon's coolpix cameras since I first bought a S1.  I figured it was time for an upgrade but I've never been a fan of GIANT cameras.  The S700 fits comfortably in my pocket even inside the camera case I have for it.  The photo quality and ease of use is ridiculously impressive for the size of the camera!  You can even use the camera to record movie shots and record voice memos.  One thing though; Be sure to get a decent memory card along with the S700 especially if you plan on taking full advantage of this camera's megapixel abilities.  If you are looking for a great Christmas present for someone, or even a gift for yourself I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "For the people who dont know much about digital cameras...", "Author": "Natalie E.

It takes excellent pictures and if you have a shakey hand, no worries, it has vr reduction that make your pictures come out looking better than ever!I will say that the menus are somewhat hard to navigate at first. It takes a little tinkering. But straight out of the box it has auto everything so if you dont want to get all fancy, it does the work for you!It has really cool features, takes EXCELLENT video, and pics are high enough quality to print poster size! If you take a lot of pictures be sure that you have a good enough memory to hold them all if taking all 12.1mp pictures. You can reduce the megapixels if you want.Another cool features is the BSS, Best Shot Selector. If you have kids playing sports or who just cant sit still, this feature takes up to 10 shots fast and picks and saves the best shot. Pretty cool.This camera is good for people who want something small, fast starting up and picture taking, and turns out almost professional looking pictures.The battery life isnt the best, BUT, just buy another battery! Get a high \"mAh\" battery (cause those last longer). They only cost like $8.00 online, yes, you can find them. Just google en-el 10. The battery takes 100 minutes to charge so I suggest having at least 3 batteries. They are super super small and take up zero room and are way better than lagging around regular batteries.I would also recommend this camera to professional photographers who want something smaller.", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Minus and plus of this camera!!", "Author": "OVIDIU HELJU \"HLJ\"", "ReviewID": "R1DAV04KBZQNVB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have own digital cameras since 2002,Sony Cybershoot,Canon,Casio,and this is my first Nikon.I was so close to by the Cannon Elf SD950IS, Canon take's great pictures,5 star, But instead to have more pleasanty and nice shape the new elfs looks like soup dish,so bulky,I mean hello, it's a point and shoot camera destinated to carry it in your pocket,can i do that with thouse bulky canons?Canon needs to review an change this design for elf cameras.the first models where much better than new one?!And lot of people when they decide to buy a camera,50% is not just the performance is the design as well!
