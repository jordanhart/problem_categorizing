{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Buzzers Ready", "Author": "Carl Le Boeuf \"Chuck Logic\"", "ReviewID": "RSYVI1I9DTINM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The system is exactly what it claims to be, a controlled lock out buzzer system.  It is easy to use and understand, very simple concept.  It works beautifully and will be a welcome addition to my game nights.  The entire system is very compact and fits in a case the size of a large laptop.  The only negative I can find thus far is that there should be some kind of wire maintenance for the cables as they are long and get tangled easier.  I had to go out and buy my own to fix the problem.  Outside of being very tangled the first time I set it up, I am very pleased thus far.", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Flawless Functionality", "Author": "Melifluous Audio", "ReviewID": "RS0SDS99TNDNK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've run across quite a few academic buzzer systems in my day, but this one does a marvelous job of blending simplicity with functionality.  Setup and takedown is simple, and the system is not prone to malfunction as is the case with many other units.  Yes, the buzzers themselves are small, diminutive even, but they WORK.  Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Middle School kids say YEAH!", "Author": "Michael Matera", "ReviewID": "R3KDVVF1REP3A5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is awesome... While I freely admit it does not look special, but what it does it does right. These middle school kids love review days now. I call them Royal Rumbles and the moments are tense as they are fighting for the right answer with speed. I get through more questions now that students don't fight over who raised their hands first. This thing is so worth the money. Oh, another point, it is built like a tank. This thing will last and last through the years. So take the cost and divided it by the number of reviews you might have and then by the years you have left teaching. Pennies on the dollar for me.Hope you guys enjoy. It is so worth it.", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "sound", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3IAXO2GRRWN0C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Works fine but how do you get it to buzz?
