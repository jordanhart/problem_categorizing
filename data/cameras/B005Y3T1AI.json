Meyer \"Wedding Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R1N79F4GCEV1EL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a summary of my experience with the Canon 1DX for the first three months.  Skip to the bottom of this review if you want my final impressions of the camera after the honeymoon period.  My previous camera was the 5DII, mainly for weddings and portraits.  I mostly look for low light performance.1st Day 7/20/2012: I took several photos of my 13 year old daughter in dark incandescent light at 6400 and 25,600 ISO with an 85/1.2II lens at f/2.0.  I ran both photos through LR4 with +10 noise reduction.  I always shoot in RAW, so some post processing noise reduction is a must.  Here's what I noticed.  At 6400 ISO,  I could see the downy blond baby hairs on her forehead and there wasn't much noise in the dark areas, just a bit of grain.  At 25,600 ISO, the dark areas had grainy noise and those little downy hairs disappeared.  But, the image was totally usable.  My wife really liked it.  I noticed that at these high ISO's any underexposure results in a significant increase in noise.  So, overexposing a little minimizes noise at the higher ISO's.  The autofocus is blazing fast in good light, and in dim light slows down.  It takes about 1 to 3 seconds to focus in low light, and as long as there is an area of contrast, it will focus.  Low light AF is about a third stop improvement over my 5DII, which was a pretty solid low light focuser (because I had sent it in to have AF tweaked).  I was expecting more, but I'll take it because it's better than the 1DIV.  I borrowed a 1DIV for 5 weddings and it hunted badly in low light, about a stop worse than my 5DII.  Up to 12,800 ISO, I wouldn't hesitate to use the images from the 1DX.  Images up to 25,600 ISO are usable depending on how much noise and detail are desired.  There is one deficiency I noticed.  In Manual mode, the exposure indicator does not show up on the top LCD, but only when looking into the viewfinder.  It really should.  I called Canon and it turns out this is unique to the 1D's.  It is displayed for Av and Tv modes, where it is centered until exposure compensation is used.  When posing a group I take a quick exposure reading on the top of 5DII without looking through the viewfinder because once I put the camera up to my face, people expect me to start snapping.  Well, since weddings are my mainstay, I can usually guess to within 1/2 stop anyway, so I suppose I can live without this feature.7/26/2012 Update:  I wanted to see how long it took for the buffer to fill up with a UDMA card.  It got to around 200 or 300 and error code 30 appeared.  It didn't go away and Canon CPS said it was a locked shutter.  I sent it in for a new unit and I'm waiting for it.7/30/2012 Update:  I received the replacement, took it out of the box and snapped photos for a half an hour.  When I put the cap on the 85/1.2II I accidentally pressed the shutter button halfway and got an error code 80.  It went away after taking the cap back off.  Canon said it wasn't mechanical, likely software or electrical.  That was good enough for me.8/8/2012 Update: I went to the park and photographed my daughter swinging using the 85/1.2II lens. This is probably Canon's slowest focusing lens because of the way it moves the entire heavy internal glass. It's meant for portraits, not for sports. With my daughter coming toward me, the AF tracked her in AIServo. To give some perspective, this is something I have never been able to do with the 5DII and 40D. The glass takes over a second to move from one end to the other.  Looking at them in LR4, I had a 50% keeper rate, which is excellent given that the 5DII would have had none. This camera pushes AF very hard. I'm liking this. What I'm not liking? The AF point doesn't light up when I press the shutter halfway down until it locks focus. That means in very dark conditions, I have to guess where the AF point is so I can focus it on the intended spot.  This kind of defeats the super low light capability. I could press the AF selection button to light it up, but that's a delay which defeats the element of speed and it also lights up all the AF points like a Christmas tree.  It took several calls to Canon CPS for me to realize that this feature, which was on the 5DII, is now gone.  Some of Canon's CPS techs were convinced it was there and it just needed to be turned on.  It's really gone.8/13/2012 Update:  I shot two weddings.  One was very dark and went late into the night.  I did some portraits of the couple walking around the gardens in the dark as I experimented with off camera flash.  These images are usually my clients' favorites because of the dramatic light effects.  But, it's usually the end of the day and clients are tired.  I have to work fast.  The AF not blinking with a half-press of the shutter button was a problem.  It took nearly 10 to 20 seconds to lock focus versus 3 to 5 seconds with the 5DII.  After a few of these, the couple wanted to head back.  With the 5DII, I half press the shutter button and the AF point blinks to let me know where it is.  Then, I move this AF point to focus on a high contrast area of the face or edge of the white dress, recompose, and take the shot.  Then, it's off to the next pose or location for another shot or two.  With the 1DX, I was unable to locate a high contrast area without knowing exactly where the center AF point was.  It was grayed out.  As a workaround, I tried using the AF point selection button on the back.  It lit up all the AF points and blinded that eye to the dark.  Using this camera in low light now requires a minimum of 2 to 3 seconds more to lock focus versus the 5DII.  I'm baffled as to what Canon was thinking when they decided to eliminate this feature.8/28/2012 Update:  I shot another wedding with the 1DX in relatively good light.  I did the formals at ISO 1600 as I generally do with the 5DII.  I used a tripod and dragged the shutter, which results in images that are sharp, yet with the look of balanced lighting.  What I noticed is that at 1600 ISO, the 1DX was maybe 1/2 stop ahead of the 5DII in terms of noise and detail rendition.  I expected the images to be a full 2 stops cleaner at 1600 ISO, more like 400 ISO on the 5DII.  I also noticed that 4000 ISO images weren't all that different from ones at 1600 ISO.  Noise hardly changed.  The lighting at this wedding was dim incandescent with backlighting from windows.  At an outdoor wedding I did two weeks ago, 1600 and 4000 ISO were much cleaner in the dark areas throughout the entire wedding.  So, now I'm wondering if mixed lighting affects noise.I used auto white balance for the entire day and it was very accurate.  It got confused on a few images with mixed light, but even then it wasn't far off.  It was a small wedding and I shot just under 1200 images, with about 400 repeats in the mix.  The battery was still at half charge at the end.  One issue I ran into was that on three separate incidents, with the 85/1.2II and 16-35/2.8II lens, AF quit working.  Nothing would happen when I pressed the shutter button, even when I depressed it all the way to take the photo.  Focusing on something else worked for the first two instances, and for the third, I had to restart the camera.  I remember having this issue when I first got my 5DII and I had to send it in twice before it was fixed completely.  So, I'm hoping this was operator error and not the same issue.8/29/2012 Update:  I installed the new firmware.  This had a fix for error code 80 from 7/30/2012.9/4/2012 Update:  I shot two more weddings.  I wanted to better understand how mixed lighting affects noise in the dark areas at higher ISO's because I had noticed some high noise levels from 1600 to 4000 ISO in my 8/28/2012 update.  At one wedding, skin tones were very dark and so were the suits, and lighting was mixed.  The wedding party had many people, so for group shots I used f/11 to get enough depth of field with a 35mm/1.4 lens.  I went to 8,000 ISO, then to 12,800 ISO.  The 8,000 ISO images looked fine with +25 noise reduction in LR4.  I would not hesitate to blow these up to 11x14 or even larger.  ISO 12,800 came close to looking like the 8,000 ISO with more noise reduction applied.  I'm conservative, and another photographer said he would use these up to much larger sizes.  What I did differently at this wedding was to overexpose the entire image by 1/2 stop by exposing for the darker areas, then bringing exposure down in post processing.  This minimized noise in the dark areas, even though I dodged some exposure back into them.  What I had encountered in my 8/28/2012 update - high noise levels from 1600 to 4000 ISO - was the result of underexposing the dark areas of the image.No issues with the AF freezing.1DX colors are more accurate than the 5DII.  If a scene is cloudy, the 1DX will produce an image that is cooler, not necessarily more blue, but more true to what it is.  At first I thought these images had a more dead-looking skin tone and didn't like it.  But, now I'm realizing it's just more accurate than what it was with the 5DII.  Also, now that I've examined a couple thousand 1DX images next to 5DII images taken by my assistant, I'm noticing that 5DII images have a slightly purple tint that creeps in when I reduce color temperature of an image that was shot in strong yellow incandescent light.  Not so much with the 1DX.Conservatively here's how I see the noise levels on the 1DX compared to the 5DII (for example, noise at ISO 4000 on the 1DX looks roughly like noise at ISO 1600 on the 5DII).  These comparisons are AFTER noise reduction was applied in LR4 on RAW files.5DII  1DX800  1600-20001600  40002000  64003200  12,8001DX noise looks more like film grain and cleans up better than 5DII noise.  So, at times I can get ISO 6400 on the 1DX to look like ISO 1600 on the 5DII by overexposing and bringing it back in post processing.  The noise performance is very impressive.9/24/2012 Update:  I shot another wedding this past Saturday.  AF froze twice, once with an 85/1.2II and the second time with the 35/1.4.  On the second incident the bride threw her bouquet and I missed it completely.  I had just put the 35/1.4 lens on, and this time, not only did AF freeze, but I couldn't change any settings.  I jiggled the lens, made sure the power switch was set to full ON, pulled the 580EXII flash off and reinstalled it (since it comes loose throughout the day), removed and re-installed the lens, and finally I made sure the top LCD (that shows the settings) was on - it was.  Then, I  turned the camera off and on (I think twice), which got it working again.  Either way, I wanted to be methodical about my troubleshooting before turning the camera off to make absolutely sure it was not operator error.  That cost me some crucial shots.  I called Canon CPS and they recommended I send it in.  Being an intermittent occurrence, I will wait and see if it becomes more repeatable so Canon has a better chance of catching it when I send it in.  I'm hoping there's a firmware update that resolves this and that it's not really the camera.  My 5DII had this issue when it was new, mostly with heavy lenses.  The fix took two repair visits - a tighter lens mounting pad.10/3/2012 Update, two weddings:  Off-center AF points are at least 1 stop less sensitive than the center AF point.  In dim light, they tend to hunt, so I use the center AF and recompose.10/13/2012 Update, three weddings later:  AF froze twice, and I was able to get it going again so I didn't miss critical shots.  It happens most reliabily with the 70-200/2.8 IS II, right about the time the bride is coming down the aisle.  It's like it needs a much stronger contrast with that lens.  It will simply not work on the groom or bride's outfits.  I have to aim it dead center at the hairline on their faces.  Then again, that's if I can find the darkened focus point in low light to put it there.  It's gotten to the point where I almost never use the 70-200/2.8 IS II anymore because focus with it is now an issue on this camera.  In reception low light?  That lens stays in the bag.  It can't focus.There is an issue with AI Servo - it does not work reliably in low light, say with people dancing in a reception.  And, it gets much worse with non-center AF points.  Pressing the shutter halfway, AI Servo lags the action by about 3 seconds, which would be fine if people were moving and stopping every few seconds to have their picture taken.  The worst was when AI Servo was used with 61-point automatic selection AF, where the camera automatically selects focus.  After about 20 minutes I got lucky with one shot out of about 300 hundred, only because there was a pause in the action.  The only thing that works reliably in low light, then, is center focus/recompose in single shot mode.  AI Servo is useless in low light.Another issue I have been fighting, and I finally figured it is the camera and not me, is that the playback button works intermittently when a 580EXII flash is camera-mounted while a pocket wizard is plugged into the camera sync port.  Those two bring this issue out reliably.  The problem is that when I press the playback button it will only show the image for a fraction of a second.  If I press it again, it will not play back the image, just go black.  At first I thought surely I had my finger on the shutter button or I was resting the camera on something that caused the other shutter button to be pressed halfway.  Tonight, I made sure nothing was touching the shutter buttons when I pressed the playback button and it happened on 7 separate occasions.  It happens about 20% of the time and is especially annoying when the bride and groom want to see an image on the back of the camera.  I will have to either turn the camera off or hammer the playback button about 10 times.10/21/2012 Update:  Canon released a firmware update v1.1.1 that addressed the grayed out AF point for AI Servo, but not for single shot mode, which is what wedding and portrait photographers need.  I spoke with Canon CPS representatives and they explained that on the 5DII and 40D, the AF points are etched onto the glass that you look through.  So, they can be lit up individually before focus confirmation with a half press of the shutter button.  On the 1DX, 7D and 5DIII, AF points are not etched onto a glass, but displayed through an LCD and thus cannot be lit up until focus is achieved.  The firmware fix for AI Servo doesn't really light up the AF point anyway - it turns on a light at the edge of the screen that illuminates the entire screen.  So, it's not really a fix, but better than nothing if you're a sports/wildlife photographer.  I'm still not clear as to why Canon took this route in the 1DX's screen design.  It's supposed to be the way all their new focusing screens work.  The 7D, 5DIII, and 1DX all have grayed out AF points.  It is a big step backward for me as a wedding photographer because over half my images are in low light.My enthusiasm has diminished a lot from when I purchased this camera.  If you're a sports photographer in relatively good light, this camera is for you.  I can't imagine a better sports camera on the market.  But, if you're a wedding photographer, I would recommend looking at the 5DIII.  The 1DX isn't worth the extra $3500, particularly since the 5DIII is lighter, has more megapixels, has the same 61 point AF system, has similar noise performance at high ISO's, and is reasonably weather sealed.  The only advantages of the 1DX are its 12 fps, sturdy build, and additional weather sealing.  That's not much for the extra money, if you ask me, particularly if you're a wedding photographer who doesn't need those features.  But, keep in mind that the 5DIII also as the darkened AF point.4/8/2013 This is one more update after setting the camera down for a few months and picking it up to do my first wedding of the season a couple of days ago.  Watching the customers twitch while I spent an additional two to three seconds trying to locate the center AF point in low light more than confirmed my earlier discomfort about the issue.  It is definitely a handicap for low light photography.  This was a particularly stressful wedding due to delays.  My assistant and I had to pick up the pace to make up for lost time.  Thankfully, it was a very nice couple.  But, because of the delays, their expectation was that I should be able to take my shots quickly after getting my settings worked out on the first group or two.  Waving my camera side to side for an additional two to three seconds to find the darkened AF point, while my assistant had already taken the shot with her Nikon D700, was unacceptable.  I was like molasses compared to her, and people's smiles would fade while I fiddled.  The camera has it's good points, but the AF measurably slows me down in low light.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon 1DX versus Canon's 1D Mark IV", "Author": "Mark Kitaoka", "ReviewID": "RY2VH2LR79M5N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I didn't purchase my 1DX through Amazon, I'm posting this review. My local retailer obtained my camera before it became available on Amazon...regrettable!I was never really a 'full frame zealot' and liked the 1.3 crop of the Mark IV. Gave me that extra bit of reach when I needed it, but conversely I was sometimes frustrated that I could not get as wide a shot as I wanted because of it. I purchased a 5D Mark III earlier this year since the 1DX was so delayed. I figured I would sell the 5D once the the 1DX came out. Bought the battery grip for it because I really missed the portrait grip and it had the extra joystick I was SO looking forward to on the 1DX. Then I got use to a full frame camera. The bokah on them is really stunning. Never really missed the extra reach losing 30% bought me with the Mark IV. Loved the new autofocus points too. Gave me more places to put my single focus point since I'm not a big focus and recompose guy. I find that technique for  many of the apertures I shoot at caused me to lose DOF and as a result out of focus shots.I also compared the ISO performance of the 5DIII with my Mark IV. Not a lot better on the 5DIII in what I shoot so I was a bit concerned about how much better the 1DX would be when it was released. Remember that I OFTEN shoot at high ISO for live theatrical performances. The average is around 6400-12800. If the scene has 'good' light I'm down around 1600-3200. In that 6400-12800 range the 5DIII was on par with the Mark IV.The menu layout on the 5DIII is the same as the 1DX so when the 1DX was finally available I was better suited to get into the 1DX right away. What I really appreciated were the new AF menu layouts. Rather than having to go through all of the trial and error of figuring out how to configure AI Servo situations reading through the menu examples really helps me out. I'm not sure how often you use AI Servo, but I use it about for about 20% of my work both in studio and during live performances depending on the subject matter. Dance is one area where I find AI Servo to be very useful. I especially like the expansion point options on the 1DX, Zone expansion that was not available on the Mark IV.The part that I absolutely HATE about the 1DX focusing versus the Mark IV is the elimination of the constant red illumination of the focus point. Let me explain. On the Mark IV even when you have not depressed the shutter or back focus button the focus points remains illuminated red. On the 1DX (and 5DIII too) unless you have pressed either focus button the focus point remains black. In the heat of the moment (where I am always at!) it's almost impossible to know where your focus point is at the time before pressing the shutter halfway or the back focus button. I have missed several shots because of this. Apparently Canon is working on a 'fix' but it's not as easy as it sounds. Apparently the exposure will change based upon the red illumination points and vary again depending on where that point is in the viewfinder. In my world I would gladly give up a slight change in exposure which can be fixed in Post versus having an out of focus shot. I hope they resolve this since it's my biggest bitch with the camera. (both of them)I have found that with the 1DX ISO 25600 is VERY usable and about on par with the Mark IV's 12800. 25600 is better than the 5DIII's 12800, so for double the price you get 1 stop better low light performance. I rarely used 25600 on the Mark IV because it was just too noisy for my needs. My personal comparison is the 1DX's 25600 is on par with the Mark IV's 12800. BUT what I like is the ability to move up from 25600 to 51200 in 1/3 stop increments.  I have used 32000 with great success when needed. But for me that's just one part of the overall equation.I have not been able to print very large format images yet from the 1DX. I just finished an assignment up in Seattle and will report my findings once the billboards are printed. I can say this, with the Mark IV my images have been used on five billboard campaigns without any up-sizing through programs like Genuine Fractals or such with great success.HandlingNow this area is VERY hard to explain, quantify, etc. When I was using the 5DIII in both a studio and live performance environment it just felt 'sluggish' to me compared to my Mark IV. Now don't assume I'm talking about the FPS difference as I rarely use that mode since I tend to be a single shooter. Most experienced action shooters including myself will tell you that anticipation and timing is the BEST way to get the 'moment' and although the high frame rate is great, it will never guarantee (and often miss) that defining moment we all strive to capture. No what I'm talking about is the absolute IMMEDIATE reaction from me thinking about pressing the shutter to actually having it 'click.' The 5DIII almost seemed like a point and shoot compared to the Mark IV and the 1DX makes the Mark IV feel sluggish! My best comparison is the feeling of driving a Porsche to a Lexus. There is a sharpness of turn in and handling that Porsche just seems to have down pat in my view. It's almost intuitive really. The 1DX feels like a Porsche Cayman in my hands.Having that extra joystick in portrait mode is a real godsend. I don't know how many cuss words I've uttered having to span my short thumb across the back to the Mark IV to get to the single joystick. And it's as perfectly positioned as the one in horizontal position. I haven't had time to configure all of the other buttons on the camera, but am looking forward to using those features.I own and use Canon's 85mm f1.2 II L lens for portraiture, but rarely used it for performance shooting. The reason is it's just too slow to focus quickly enough in low light theatre or dance. BUT the 1DX now drives autofocus on all lenses much quicker than the Mark IV or 5DII. Fast enough that I am now able to use the 85 for certain live performance sessions. Not sure what Canon did, but it's a welcome improvement.Image QualityImage quality on the 1DX is superior to the Mark IV in terms of dynamic range and the Mark IV was no slouch! For web work it's impossible for me to tell the difference between the Mark IV, 5DIII or 1DX. BUT in high quality print in large format both the 5DIII and 1DX have such a richness in color and color depth over the Mark IV.Weather SealingHaven't been on assignment with the 1DX yet, but I am going to assume it's just as if not better weather sealed than my previous 1D bodies. When I've returned from harsh weather sessions in full rain, salt water or severe dust, I routinely held the camera under my sink's faucet to remove mud, dust and salt without ever worrying about moisture getting into the internals. I will do the same with the 1DX when the need arises.Ethernet and WFT-E6AI was both happy and sad that the 1DX utilizes dual CF card slots. Sad because I like to shoot wirelessly tethered to my iPad during client studio sessions using Eye Fi cards. No it wasn't the fastest on the Mark IV or 5DIII (the 5DIII is actually faster in transmission because it has a dedicated Eye Fi optimization) but it served me well. What I did love with the 1DX is the gigabit Ethernet connection which I'd use to replace the Eye Fi option for my clients. I was shocked at how fast the transmission from shutter press to the image appearing on my laptop screen transmitted. Less than a second with a 25 foot CAT 6 cable. But the more that I thought about going to a wired tether the more I worried about people tripping over the wire. You see in my studio sessions I have all kinds of folks around from Marketing types to Art Directors, hair and makeup, set people, etc.So I figured I'd buy the WFT-E6A module and try it out for my session. If it didn't work well I thought I'd just return it and go with the wired option. I tested the performance before I left for the assignment. Keep in mind I'm using the smallest JPG size along with RAW files to my cards. I am only sending the JPGs to the laptop wired or wireless. I was shocked to find that the performance using those parameters was about the same as my wired option using Canon's EOS Utility software. Now for those who like to pixel peep or just 'have to be right' (like an old girlfriend I had to get away from!) I am not sure the actual time difference between wired and wireless transmission, but in human terms it is negligible. My client had started to complain that my camera to iPad to Shuttersnitch through Eye FI was a 'bit slow' during the sessions, so I was hoping he'd like this solution better. He was shocked and very pleased at the immediate performance of the new setup and felt it helped our workflow immensely and made our studio sessions even more efficient. So much for returning the transmitter after the session.....Which leads me to being irritated with Canon for NOT including a wireless option in a 7K camera! Granted the WFT-E6A is weather proof and very small, but come on $600.00 for a wireless option that's not built in? Geesh. On personal work I missed not being able to wirelessly transmit small JPGs to my iPad like I can with my 5DIII and Mark IV using Eye Fi cards. So I searched several sites and found a way to do so with my new 1DX using the WFT-E6A WITHOUT a router using its Ad Hoc mode. YAY!That's it for now, more after I have more experience with The Beast!", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is what we have all asked for.", "Author": "Seth Sanchez", "ReviewID": "R12F6EEWUD3U8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first camera was the 7D. I used it originally for recording videos of me playing an arcade game. I eventually started to take photos with the kit lens it comes with and began to fall in love with photography. After a few months of shooting random things, I invested in the Canon 70-200mm 2.8 IS mark ii. I started to shoot sports and began falling in love with sports photography. I then sold my arcade machine to purchase the canon 400mm 2.8 IS mark i. After a year or so, I began to get frustrated with the 7D's limits. I kept getting out of focus/soft focus images non stop. At first I had thought it was a user error, but after taking it to Canon Service THREE times, the issue kept happening. So after months of hard work, I eventually purchased the Canon 1DX and sold my 7D.Enough story telling though, let me just try to make this as clear as possible for you. This camera, is by far the most amazing thing I have ever held and used in my whole life. I have messed around with the 1D Mark IV and Mark III and the 5D Mark II and Mark III before, but none of these come close to this camera.I have used this for soccer, football, baseball, softball, tennis, track and field, night shots of city lights, portraits, and more. Is it worth $7,000? Yes.Why? Because the autofocus system alone blows me away. It is so precise every single time, I can't even believe it. With my 7D for sports I was lucky if I got a sharp image out of a burst sequence. With the 1DX, I am lucky if I get a single image that is out of focus during a burst!This has a whole autofocus menu dedicated for AI Servo that you can change depending on the scenario you are in, which is VERY helpful for you action//sports photographers out there.Now if you are debating on this or the 5D Mark III, then I vote on this. The only reason you should get the 5D over this would be if you are shooting weddings and want overall better image quality. However, this camera does have better image quality with higher ISO's, and a lot of weddings have plenty of situations where there is very little lighting.The best combo would obviously be purchasing both the 5D and 1DX, but we aren't all made of cash. The biggest difference between the two cameras really is the auto focus system. You get way more useable images with this camera against any other camera I listed before.PROS-Perfect Body DesignSuperb Image QualityAmazing Auto Focus SystemVery Easy to Get Use ToLong Shutter Life (400,000)Dual CF Card SlotVery Good in Low LightCONS-Weight (Heavier Than Normal)Very ExpensiveThe ISO on this camera is ridiculous too by the way. Ya I am sure you are thinking well who the hell will use 204k ISO? Well not really anyone haha, but people use up to 25k ISO though.I can't show you the ISO on this sucker, but I can try to compare it to the 7D since I used it so much before owning this.The 7D ISO was good for what you pay. You can use images that had 6,400 ISO, but you do see the grain at that high of an ISO on the 7D. The 1DX can be used up to 25,000 ISO for usable images.I shot a concert at 16,800 ISO and I literally couldn't see grain on the subject I shot, just a bit in dark areas. 6,400 ISO on 7D images are like 16,800 ISO on 1DX image basically.You just really need to either borrow one from a friend, or rent one from borrow lenses to really get what I am trying to explain. Reading this does not do any justice for this amazing piece of equipment. It really doesn't.If you are really serious about photography and need a camera that is going to last you for a very very long time, give you superb images, can handle very low light situations, and can take a beating, then this is your camera.Also, I have shot in pouring rain and snow with this along with the 70-200 and 400 2.8's without being covered and both the body and 2 lenses worked just fine without any issues at all.I purchased this camera, because I needed the fast as hell dead on autofocus system this camera has and I needed top notch image quality for my sports photography side. If you shoot for max preps, then you know how strict they are with image quality! They demand that you also crop as tight as possible, and when you crop images that came from this camera with an L lens, you really can't see a loss in image quality!My conclusion is this,Think really hard before making the purchase. If you have a load of cash sitting around and it doesn't effect you to spend that, go for it. If you are tight on money and don't really NEED what this camera has, then either wait it off and keep saving until you are okay, or go for the 5D or even a 1D Mark IV if you need a fast burst for action. If there is any way for you to be able to purchase this camera, then do it.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't let the 18 MP or price dissuade you from giving this body serious consideration", "Author": "A.H.", "ReviewID": "RJXXJGDHJFT7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best digital SLR camera in production right now. We finally have a full frame high frame rate camera that has excellent dynamic range, great resolution, and a compact flash card write buffer and write speed capability that has never been exceeded in my use of this body.The price of this camera body is higher than the other camera bodies for sale by Canon today. I think the questions I can answer in this review are: 1. How good is this camera in practice? 2. What can it do that other camera bodies can't do? 3. How much better is it than the other professional body offered by Canon, the 5D III, or older 1 series bodies? 4. Is the price justified, is it priced too high, or is the price a deal? I'll answer these questions in this review.In practice, this camera dominates. I am upgrading from a 5D II and a 1D III. It's substantially better than either of those. The addition of the multi controller for the vertical grip is the best usage improvement. I have used this for fast moving hummingbirds, and professional sports.  Ergonomics on this body are winning. The multi controllers make the selection of autofocus points extremely fast, and with the new autofocus system on this camera, you will be selecting specific points all the time now because you have autofocus points all over the viewfinder. I don't focus and recompose nearly as much as I used to. The autofocus system is extremely customizable and you will find a responsive servo mode for just about everything that you will shoot. The metering system also seems to be more accurate. I recently started working in evaluative for the first time in about 5 years and I think I might stick with this for a while instead of spot. The autofocus and metering sensor work together now in full auto servo autofocus mode, and it does track very well. I tested how automated I can go, and I am getting perfectly exposed shots of football and baseball with very little involvement on my part. It's very cool. And even though I don't use it too much, can't complain about 12 FPS. The low light photography ability of this body is also incredible, from an image quality perspective as well as a focusing perspective. I am nailing autofocus with no AF Assist at night on poorly contrasted subjects with only street lamps. I tried the experiment with my 5D II and the 5D would focus on subject matter beyond the test subject where the lighting was brighter. The 1D correctly focused on the less bright closer object. Usable ISO is also mind blowing. I published shots that were taken on a baseball field, without flash, at night, using 12800 ISO and a 1/1000 shutter speed at f/2.8. I couldn't believe I could ever freeze action without flash at night. Minor noise reduction and sharpening required, but it looks perfect for 8 x 10 prints. The response time of the shutter from when you press the button is faster than any other camera I have used as well. It's so fast, I can hardly notice the mirror close off the viewfinder now and it is shocking that it happens RIGHT when the shutter is pressed. It may only be a few shorter milliseconds on a technical sheet, but it is noticeable. A side effect of this is that while in Servo mode, you can more easily follow the action through the viewfinder at 12 FPS between mirror flaps. So useful.What can this camera do that others can't? The 12 FPS is still the fastest frame rate of any other camera available right now. The autofocus system is shared with the 5D III, but the focus system is the best I have ever used. The metering system is great and accurate in evaluative mode. It's an upgrade from the prior 1D series to 100 zones from 63 zones. Like I mentioned above in the usage paragraph, the metering system is linked with the autofocus system because the metering system uses an additional image sensor that processes color, contrast, and luminescence. It made perfect sense to combine the imaging sensor with the focus processor, and it does allow this camera to track extremely accurately. The usable ISO is up to 12800 in my opinion, but I can grab shots at the maximum 51200 and they aren't bad at all. For smaller prints like an 8 x 10, my opinion is that ISO 51200 is acceptable for sale after noise reduction and sharpening.How much better is this than the 5D III? It has better weather sealing than the 5D and is built like a tank. You can drop it and it won't even dent. It has a much better metering system, and the linked autofocus system with the metering system makes the 1D X better in Servo Mode. It also comes with the integrated vertical grip, and even though my 5D III has a very solid feeling battery grip, the integrated vertical grip of the 1D means you can really handle the camera by the vertical grip and apply torque while holding it. Additionally, the placement of the multi controller and the CF card slots is improved because there is no separation along the body where the camera body ends and the battery grip begins like on the 5D. The multi controller on the vertical grip is slightly more accessible as a result, and so is the compact flash card door (it appears to be better weather sealed as well.) there is also an additional multi-function button that can be programmed on the 1D X body that the 5D III doesn't have. I will be honest: I really wish the 5D had that extra programmable button, and that the 1D X had a third programmable multi-function button. I love those multifunction buttons - they are extremely useful at customizing the camera for specific applications (ex. Setting multifunction 2 to switch between servo and one shot instantly, setting multifunction 2 to toggle registered autofocus point, setting multifunction 2 to toggle spot metering.)Improvements over the 1D IV are in the autofocus system, the metering system, and the addition of the vertical grip multi controller.Finally, is price appropriate? I believe it is. It was a little hard to swallow almost $8,000 to buy this tool, but it really pulls through in terms of utilizing very good technology to it's fullest potential. I am very happy with this body. It can do more than I imagined it would, and I find that having used it for a while, I notice the inadequacy of my old bodies. That's probably the biggest indication of improvements over the prior technology. The autofocus system is first rate, the ISO is jaw dropping, it's very customizable, and it fires off so fast that you really want to keep it in high speed continuous shot mode just to get off a little bit on that machine gun sound. When I use my older equipment now, I have been slightly frustrated with the lack of customization and responsiveness that I am used to on the 1D X.The bottom line is that this body is above the cut in every metric I can assess a camera with. I have converted one friend who bought a 5D III to upgrade to the 1D X. I'm sure that anyone who tests it for more than a week will strive to do the same.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is a Sports/Wedding/Event/Journalism Camera", "Author": "lankynibbs", "ReviewID": "R1Z4J4HHR5S2K5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started out with the Canon 40D, but rapidly felt its limitations, so upgraded to the 7D.  My 7D was a camera I loved except for noise, which seemed to be a very weak point.  The 1DX feels like it is 2 full stops more sensitive than the 7D, and the high ISOs that on other cameras would make my ears bleed, do not even cause the 1DX to break out in a sweat.  If you are a photographer who captures action of any kind, or you absolutely, positively have to get the shot, this is your baby.  I havent been in the studio with it yet, but I am guessing its performance there will be about what you would expect in controlled lighting conditions.  As for handling and feel, it took me a couple weeks to get used to my 7D, but about an hour to feel completely comfortable with the 1DX.  It is a big box, certainly, but the heft and grip just feel right after a short time.  Battery life is less than optimal, so count on bringing a second battery to your typical model shoot... you get a little over 1100 pics per fully charged battery pack.

I am shooting at ISO 4000, 3.2f, speed 500 with a 70-200 2.8 L IS II lens. I have shot about 30,000 pictures with the 1Dx since I got it in July.This is a great camera and I view the bugs as something canon will fix; everything else about the camera is amazing.This is not a point and shoot camera and will require you to actually read the manual.  I believe most photographers bought this camera because it is a must have when shooting in low light.  I can shoot at ISO 4000 and get much better pictures than my 1d mark IV at ISO 2000.  It allows you to up the speed and f-stop when you are shooting in low light so you get more photos that are keepers.ISSUEHaving said that it appears to have an Issue in low light with AI Servo on high shutter speed, I have not tested it on lower shutter speeds but I will this weekend.  I shoot at the high frame rate and mostly at night, if I shoot in the day I have not seen this issue.It seems like the autofocus locks up or stops tracking.  When the subject is running I will get groups of pictures that are in perfect focus and groups of pictures that are not in focus.  At first I thought it was the AI-servo case I was using but I have tried several AI Servo cases it doesn't seem to matter.  I shot 2 soccer games during the day with full sun and I did not notice the issue.  I went back and reviewed the photos and the focus point is on the subject and it is clearly blurry even on the camera.The other thing I checked was my distance from the subject; with this lens you have 2 settings 1.2 and 5 meters.  I set it on 5 meters and I am never that close.The other minor issue is the focus points are black, and most sports photographers use spot focus.  The challenge is you want to keep the focus point on your subject when they are moving, if it is low light and the focus point is black it makes that very difficult to see were the focus point is.  It would be better if they made the focus point red like it was on the 1D mark IV.  The red focus point helps you concentrate on shooting the game; it is a common problem to start watching the play and not thinking about the shot.I am a photographer not a parent with a player.I am not an expert tester but I am an experienced photographer.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sensor Dust Issue", "Author": "Naz", "ReviewID": "RJ0IYI6US1L8K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This will be an ongoing review as I've only had the camera a short while and just getting to know it and strengths and weaknesses- First off let me say the images at high ISOs like 6400,8000,even 10,000 are very very good- I had a canon 7d and anything over 800 ISO would look quite noisy, but with this 1DX the images at high ISO look fantastic. I've taken photos in nearly dark conditions where it was even hard to see the subject- (And when I say 'hard to see the subject' I literally mean that all I could see was a sillouette outline of the subject, and could not make out details and features at all, due to the darkness- situations where I never thoguht it possible to shoot without a flash) and the photos look like they were shot in good light during the day- honest- This camera has opened up evening shots that were out of the question with my 7D due to low light-Second, let me say that the speed of the shutter is fantastic and sounds just awesome- I shoot birds in flight quite a bit, and getting the right frame during a landing needs at least 8 frames a second sometimes for fast moving ducks and such- this delivers 12 frames a second- more than enough really, but really nice to have just the same. Most of the shots come out in focus thansk to the great focusiing system of the 1DX which just seems to lock on and not let go. I'm experimentign with the different focus choices, but so far using the exanded spot metering with evaluative seems to be working very well. It may miss a few shots here and there, but my goodness, this is blistering off 12 frames a second and nailing almsot all of the shots at this speed? Quite an accomplishement if you ask me.Third, The weight and feel of this camera are just outstanding. After using it for a week, and then taking up my 7D again, the 7D feels like a toy now- I had liked how the 7D felt before, but now, I really like how the 1DX feels- it just feels solid, rugged, and comfortable in the hands- I also like the portrait shooting with the buttons on the side instead of having to twist like a pretzal to get portrait shots like I do with the 7D (I don't have the battery grip for the 7D). The weight is a little much for some, but I like the extra weight really- I find that I can steady it well, and with a smaller lens, it's very comfortable to use for longer periods of time- but some might find it a bit heavy I suppsoe- I use it with my Sigma 50-500 OS and the combo is quite heavy- and it's not something I'd want to use all day long without many breaks, but for short periods, it's not too bad even with this lens- The camera fits my hand like a glove- it's such a comfortable hold- I thought the canon 7D was a good feel ergonomically, but the 1DX is even better thanks to it's improved ergonomics- and the rubber casing has a great feel to it too- the camera feels secure while holding, and if you couple the camera with a lens like the Bigma 50-500 OS, you'll develop into Arnold Swartzenagger in a little under 6 months top.Fourth, I love the two card slots- I'm using the Lexar Professional 1000x 32 GB CompactFlash Card 2-Pack LCF32GCTBNA10002  which I find to be very fast, large buffer, and holds lots of photos, especially when shooting jpg's (holds about 2000 large jpg's I believe per card). I saw a video review of a similiar card on Youtube showing the differences between a fast card like this one and the slower cards, and it was quite a difference between the buffer fill time of both cards- The faster card just kept going and going and going while the person held the shutter button down- and the recovery from buffer fill (that period when the camera can't do anything because it's too busy writing to the card) was much much faster with the faster card. I haven't done any tests between this card and my older sandisk 8 gig 32mg/second? (I think that was the speed), but I would imagine that the difference is like night and day- I've not run into buffer fill with this card yet, and I've done a few longish action shots sequences- so far, no problems with the card-Fifth, This truly is a weather sealed camera- everything locks down tight and securely, sealed well against the elements- unlike the 7D which had kinda flimsy closures for the card and cables areas on the camera- I've already been caught in a bit of a downpour, and I really was less worried about this camera than I would have been with my 7D in those conditions.I'll be adding more positives soon as I learn them, but for now I have to mention a couple of negativesFirst, The camera gives a \"Caution 02\" warning (if you go to the menu, 4'th sector in the wrench settings, down to 'Status Update Display, then click on info, then info again, you'll find all your camera's warnings- I've gotten 3 warnings about 'unexpected drop in battery power' \"Caution 02\" warnings- I'm currently in email correspondence with Canon services about the issue- I've spoken with others about the issue, and they have the same warnings in their 1DX's- not sure what's going on here as there is very little info about this warning on the internet that I can findSecond, My camera arrived with a very filthy sensor filter- and the filth is not simply dust it would appear- I was able to dislodge some of the larger dust particles (which actually looked like dust particles when viewing shots of the sky at small apertures like f/22) but there appears to be splatters of something across the whole sensor filter which can not be taken care of with just air cleaning. I've noted on several forums that this appears to be a somewhat common problem with the 1DX? I'm also corresponding with canon about this issue as well- which I';m sure they will want me to 'send it in for inspection' which will mean being without a camera for probably several weeks- yay- I spend nearly $9000 only to have to have it serviced almost immediately? There seems to be something about Canon's new second generation dust removal system that makes the sensor filter less strong and more susceptible to damage if the owner tries to clean sensor filter themselves? Not sure if this is true or not, but it's got me a little worried about attempting a cleaning myself until I learn more- I was almost convinced that cleaning sensors wasn't too big a deal before I got my 1DX, and figured I could simply clean my sensor myself without much problem, but after reading some postings on the issue after researching the dust/filth on 1DX sensor issue, I'm not as confident anymore after learning about this supposed new sensor issue? Someone correct me if I'm wrong please- But back to the actual dust issue- it was pretty disconcerting to see the issue in my sky shots- and after looking it up online, it looks like others are having the same issue with this camera- I've seen photos of other folk's sky photos, and they look exactly like mine- A little actual dust is fine, no big deal, but I'm talking about so much filth that the photos are pretty unusable if they are small aperture and have sky in themas I said, this will be an ongoing review- I'm no pro, so I don't know all the tech terms and functions and settings yet, so this will be a quite informal review by an average Joe- this is all a learning experience for me too- to shwo that I'm no pro, I used my canon 7d for what? 3 years and never knew about the exposure lock button until just recently- and now that I know about it, I wonder how I got along without it for those 3 years (Manual? What's a manual?)Quick update- just tried with my Canon 85mm 1.8 and wow- this lens really shines on this camera- the detail was fantastic- showing even the fine hairs on a face from about 10 feet away or so- even at 1.8 the detail was fantastic, aqndf the bokeh was smooth and fantastic looking- the lens was good on the canon 7D too, but it really shiens o nthe 1DX- I'm really likign hte results- I couldn't beleive how much sharper and how much more detail was seen with this lens compared to my 50-500 on the 1DX- I wish I knew how to post photos to show the differences- anyways- the contrast is also quite good too- More review to come Lord WillingUpdate Dec 11/12: Still getting the 'Caution 02' warnings- there doesn't seen to be any set reason as to why it's happening- I've spoken with many who are experiencing this issue too- Also, many of us with the 1DX are coming to the conclusion that the dirt is most likely excess lubricant that is splattering around inside the chamber when taking photos. The site \"the-digital-picture\" . com has an excellent review of the 1DX and talks about the 1DX and the sensor dirt somewhat too- It's just frustrating spending this amount of money, begin excited about getting the camera, then having to send it back in almost immediately- On a cheerier note, I just received my canon 35mm 1.4 lens- tried it on the camera, and wow! What a lens! What a combo! it really shines on the 1DX (and will make a nice 50mm or so equivalent on my canon 7D too). With the 1DX and it's high iso capability, and the 1.4 of the lens, I'm taking shots with very little noise that I could never have dreamed about with my 7D, and am able to shoot much later into the evening outside with available, or lack thereof as the case may be, light. The camera is locking onto subjects that I can barely even see with my eye because it's so dark out, and the focus acquisition seems fairly quick and accurate with the camera lens. I also did a series of tests through the different F stops right up to 22 for sharpness contrast etc, and this is one fine lens and camera combo- photos are very sharp- even down to f/1.4 (which is obviously 'softer' but still much much sharper than any lens I've had to date). I'll be going out today to get some environmental shots and landscape shots to test for sharpness and detail/resolution- I suspect I'll be more than pleased with the results judging from my previous sharpness/contrast test. As I update this review, I will be more specific as to the functions of the camera, IE: Focus strengths/weaknesses, low light capabilities or lack thereof, menu functionality, etc.UPDATE 10/6/13: Just foudn out that the \"Caution 02\" was fixed via a firmware update, and also just found out that the filthy sensor is apparentyl due to insufficient lubrication in the mirror box assembly- evidently the 'symptom' is 'specks i nthe upper left corner' (buy my whole sensor is covered in these specks, and has been since day one- only it';s gotten worse over the months)Also- when I turn camera to portrait orientation, the portrait orientation scroll wheel that changes the aprature sometimes won't work- I have to turn camera to landscape orientation, move that scroll wheel to change aperature, then I can again use the portait orientation scroll wheel and the aperature will now change as needed- This issue cropped up shortly after gettign hte camera- only I thought perhaps I was doign somethign wrong- but now I think it's a problem with the camera- I'm having Canon check it out when I send the brand new camera in for their recall/checkup/repair- yippie-Feb 18 2014 UPDATE:Now Apparently The seriel number 8, along with 0-7 (basically the entire lien of 1DX's) is also affected- it seems Canon KNEW abotu htis defective mirror box assembly and yet sold the products anyways- My camera arrived with an absolutely filtyh sensor- splattered with oil and debri- it was so bad the photos were basically useless- no amount of spot healing was enough to fix the large amount of spots- I sent hte camera in, they lubricated it and apaprently that is suppsoed to 'fix' a defective part- yet 4 months after service, the same spots are showign up again due to excessive part wear and tear in the mirror box assembly. I can't beleive Canon hasn't issued a recall to all affected owners of defective 1DX's (of which there are quite a large number from the looks of it) to REPLACE the defective part with one that will NOT cause excessive soiling of the sensor. I'm very upset that Canon KNEW abotu htis problem beforehand and yet sold these cameras with DEFECTIVE parts- NO amount of lubrication is goign to 'fix' a defective part that casues plastic pices to rub against metal parts- at best it will only slow the wear and tear down for a coupel of months until the lubrication begins to wear off again-For htose that want to know if their camera shows the same crud o nthe sensor, take a photo of clear sky at f/22 - take it into photoshop, increase contrast, and look especially in the corners- upper left and right seems to be the hardest hit spots- although mine was so bad the filth was compeltetly coverign hte whole sensor-The portrait orientation scroll wheel also didn't work properly fro mthe beginning, and Canon supposedly 'fixed' the issue, but it too is not workign again the way it shoudl be- So far Canon has refused to issue a recal to replace the DEFECTIVE Mirror Box assembly, and basically is just issuing bandais for their top of thel ine model- so basically thsoe of us facing the issues caused by this FAULTY mirro box assembly pretty much got screwed- Very disheartenign hwen the camera cost so much-UPDATE MARCH 19 2014: My camera, 1 year and 3 months old, has died- Won't turn on any longer- Can't get it to power on- no matter what I try- Tried different genuine Canon batteries, tried reseating batteries, tried taking battery out with the power switch in on position etc etc etc- Nothing- Camera is dead- Come to find out, several folks o n the net are experiencing the same issue- and the camera has to be returned, at MY expense, to replace the PBF board which controls the power from the battery to the camera apparently- So basically the bottom line is- Buy a $7000 camera that has a defective mirror box assembly, has a scroll wheel that doesn't work, corrupts Raw files regularly to the tune of about 20 per 300 raw shots or so- and which will die a year later needed an expensive fix- I sure wouldn't want to have to rely on this camera for important shots- as there's no telling when it's going to just up and die on you-I'm lowering my rating because this camera has been a nightmare for me- I've only had one major purchase in my life, and it's turned out to be a lemon. It's been a very disappointing experience for me. I'll give it two stars only because the camera works great when it's working- hitting the exposure and focus almost spot on most of the time with great speed- I maybe should give it three stars, but I'm a little upset over the fact that Canon rushed this camera to market and very likely knew it had defective mirror box assembly, and possibly even knew about the power issues/defective PBF boards- and that they won't stand behind their flagship camera by actually replacing the mirror box assembly with one that is NOT defective, (i.e.: won't wear out prematurely due to wear and tear fro m the poor design of the defective box assembly)but I'm giving it a 2 star rating based on MY experiences with this camera- For those who might not be having any of these issues, I'm sure the camera is fantastic- however, that has not been MY experience", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "At first the price is unbelievably high, but then you find you are actually willing to pay it, which is even more unbelievable.", "Author": "VW151", "ReviewID": "R3C1YJDW6GSG00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bottom Line, Holy Cow it's $6800, but Holy Cow it's that good. I have been shooting Motorsports for about 4 years now with a 7D as my primary camera. Auto focus speed and accuracy is important to me. Image quality is also important but when your subject is going 100mph getting them in focus is your number 1 priority as great dynamic range means nothing if the photo is blurry.None the less, I became a CPS (Canon Professional Services) member a year or 2 ago and as part of that program I \"evaluated\" this Camera. I now own this camera. That could basically be the end of the review, WARNING, if you don't want to part with $6800 then don't try this camera out.I considered and rented the 1D mk4, and shot with a friends 5D mk3, both great cameras, in the end I still went with this camera. This should also tell you something.Why you ask? Well, 12FPS (yes there is a noticeable difference from 10) makes getting that perfect shot way easier, and it gives you more usable images. The 61 point AF system and more importantly the sophisticated AI servo tracking is insanely good. The color and overall image quality is on another planet and lastly the 400,000 click rated carbon fiber shutter is great for me since I shoot 8-10k images per event during the summer. This thing is a beast. Feels good in your hand, does everything exactly as it should. It has more features than I care to list but it just is what a pro camera should be.Then there is the other part, and I'm sure the 5D mk3 is pretty similar for this part. The low light capability. On the 7D I avoided high ISO like the plague. The noise was terrible. Not on the 1Dx, ISO 1600, images are wedding usable, 3200, still great, and when you go up from there I could not believe how well things held together. You literally get grain like in film. Sure your image quality breaks down but you don't get that ugly purple color spec stuff that the older camera's give you. I've shot as high as ISO 25,600 and sure, it's pretty grainy, but the color still looks decent, apply some Noise reduction in post processing and you still have an interesting and somewhat usable image. If you shoot ISO 25,600 and go to black and white I would liken the image quality and grain to something maybe a bit grainier than the old Kodak T-MAX 3200. So sure it's grainy, but it's also using 3x less light to make the same image, which means you have hand held shutter speed in low light situations that make it tough to use auto-focus. Maybe I'm freaking out because this is my first full frame camera, Maybe all you 5D guys are laughing but I am absolutely blown away by what you can do with the ISO on this camera.To get back to reality what this really means is, ISO1600 or less is fair game for useable images for almost anything. It's hard to put a price on being able to get a shot that other camera's just can't. This is that camera, the combined package of raw processing power, frame rate, Autofocus and low light capability mean you can literally shoot in a whole new way.My only gripe, and it's a small one, I wish this camera had the dual pixel live view AF like the 70D, and I wish it had built in GPS and wifi so you can use it with the remote app out of the box. Not because I'm dying for these features but because you can get them on the 70D and 6D and this camera is the current flagship. I don't want to pay $600 for a wifi module.

I made the plunge this year with the 1Dx in hopes that is superior low light image quality coupled with real sports oriented AF and frame rate would allow me to be a bit more spontaneous on the sideline and really increase my `keeper' rate.Ergonomics:It doesn't get any better than this. Ever since the 1DmkII, I've fallen for the 1D body configuration and I've fitted all my cameras with extended battery grips but they never come close to the comfort of a real 1D body. All controls (and Canon crammed a lot of em in there) fall comfortably under your thumb and finger tips.  You can quickly make adjustments to most of the major camera settings without ever taking your eye from the viewfinder.  I sorta wish they used a dial  for mode selection like on the 5D, I use custom settings quite a bit and I think using the dial to switch between them is much faster  than the 1Dx's button press plus scroll  - but that's such a small nit pic.AF:Most of the internet reviews have commented how immediate the AF is on the 1Dx - I guess it's all relative, compared to my 5DmkII this thing is WORLDS faster but my old 1DmkII with the 300F2.8 lens has been my standard for AF speed and tracking performance and regardless of what the numbers say, I don't feel that the 1Dx is significantly faster than that model is - just than now I can finally enjoy this focusing speed at night.What the 1Dx does bring to the table is 4 menu pages of AF parameter settings to tweak. I'm a major geek so I appreciate the ability to tweak things the way I like but I'm sure others may have an opinion similar to my Nikon friend that says `you shouldn't need a 32 page white paper to learn how to use the autofocus of your camera...It should just work'. I can't really argue with that logic. One interesting mode that is exclusive to the 1Dx (for now) is Canon's Intelligent Tracking and Recognition(iTR) mode that uses data from the 100,000 pixel color metering system to `recognize' the subject and track it across the screen automatically switching between the 61 AF sensors to maintain focus. Wow this sounds really awesome, reading the marketing literature. But,  iTR can only be selected when the camera is in Automatic Focal point Selection, a mode that I never use because it rarely focuses on what I want to focus on .  Unfortunately I found this to be true here as well, at least for my Football shooting, where there are many objects in view,  all wearing similar colors. I'd imagine it'd work pretty well on single subjects, like a tennis player or a car on a track, but then again, I never had issue with the accuracy of the normal AiServo modes for tracking things like this.Image Quality:It all comes down to this right? Canon's flagship doesn't disappoint here, I found images to have great color rendition and excellent resolution. Subtle textures  are rendered with such great detail that doesn't make me miss the extra megapixels of the 5D.  And unlike the files I got from the 5DmkII, which I found to be a bit unexciting and in need a bit of mid tone contrast adjustment and sharpening in post, I am liking these straight out of the camera.In my initial game day outing I did something I never do, I shot in jpg. I wanted to see how all the camera's bells and whistles worked to produce a finished image. So I set the camera to F2.8@1/500s and let the camera auto adjust ISO for the correct exposure.I found the camera's auto white balance did an excellent job maintaining sensible colors as lighting changed from daylight to dusk to sodium vapor lighting. The Matrix metering did an admirable job of not blowing out white jerseys against a dark background.  The Standard Noise reduction setting however, was a little too heavy handed for my taste, smearing finer textures into an almost cellophane look but otherwise excellent in holding detail in medium and larger textures and eliminating color noise in the shadows. Any noise in the shadows had a film like grain to it which I found pleasing.  All in all, I'd judged the jpg quality with NR to be better that what I was able to achieve shooting raw at the same ISO with the 5dmkII and doing NR in post. I think if I bump the NR down a click, I'll be happy shooting jpg and finally just go from shoot to publish without any post processing.Conclusion:The 1Dx is an AMAZING camera, I barely touched on a fraction of its feature (nor will I likely use all of them), but $6700? That's $2k more than the 1DmkIV it replaces. I think Canon pushing their prices a bit too far North lately and honestly, if I didn't have a fortune in Canon Lenses, I'd be writing a Nikon review right now.You may have noticed there was a 5DmkIII in my opening paragraph; I picked that up because I was afraid the 1Dx wouldn't ship before the season started. I seriously thought of cancelling the 1Dx order after shooting the 5DmkIII as all my complaints about the mkII were fixed - better build quality, higher frame rate, a modern AF system. In fact the jury is still out on this one. I'm only keeping one of them so I'll be shooting these side by side this season -  I think the 5DmkIII may win out at $3k less.To be continued.....", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast, Sharp and Easy to Use", "Author": "T.

And it was worth the wait.One notable improvement is the control buttons.  The improvements over the 7D demonstrates Canon's focus to continually improve their product line for every release.  The 1DX controls are highly intuitive.  Setting bracketing, changing modes, etc. is much more intuitive.  It is clear Canon engineering took the time to do this right, not only by keeping the best of their earlier features, but also revamping the product to improve easier use.  Based on the cost of the 1DX, this is targeting the professional market, but any pro would appreciate the 1DX updates that help ensure the photographer captures the best picture regardless of the underlying technology.My main work is sports photography.  For sports photographers, there is no question the 12 to 14 fps will be much appreciated, and 12 fps more than sufficed in all cases I have encountered. Also, the camera's ability to focus while shooting in high speed continuous mode is truly amazing.  The 1DX available two CF card slots are UDMA 7 compatible.  12fps was amazingly fast and met all my needs as long as I am using a fast card.  The Lexar 1000x UDMA 7 memory card addressed that need.There are some good articles that explain the value of pixel size, and the almost 7 micron pixel size on this camera provides great results both for pictures and video.  I have taken photos in all conditions, cropped some and also performed a bit of post processing while I get familiar with the camera.  If you are considering the 5D Mark III versus the 1DX, note the 1DX specifications have one more f/stop of ISO performance than the 5D mk III.  At some point it will come down to what is in the price range and your specific need.As stated in many review, ISO on this camera is amazing.  I have pushed this camera to ISO 6400 on football fields with Tungsten lighting at night and the results are excellent after applying some quick post processing adjustments in Adobe Lightroom.  In fact, when depth of field is important with wide angle shots, I'm finding the higher ISO settings are working extremely well.  One cautionary note:  I have found when in AF mode the 1DX generally does not select the ISO setting I prefer.  In most cases I use manual mode for best results.Weather protection is second to none. Even better is the ability to remove the memory cards from the camera, very simple and solid release!The battery charger hasn't received much press, but it has multiple LEDs to let you know battery charge status (50%, 80% and fully charged), and supports charging two batteries, although you only get one battery with the camera. The provided battery is the LP-E4N - 11.1V, 2450mAh.  This canon battery new cost $168.  I purchased a third party LP-E4 battery that is compatible with the 1DX and costs $22.  I am finding the third party battery holds a slightly shorter charge, but more important, it doesn't communicate with the camera. The impact is you will not know the charge status of the battery. Also, the third party battery is a very tight fit.  To top it off,one of the post have smartly advised against third party batteries as any leakage would void the warranty.  I believe it is best to stick with canon batteries despite the additional cost.I didn't think I would use the hard wired gigabit Ethernet port, but now finding it is fast, easy to set up and includes features I did not know were available when I purchased the camera.  I now carry a dedicated laptop to most of my shoots to capture pictures on a large screen for quick review.  In addition, using an ftp server, you can transfer files as you are shooting or wait until you are done and transfer all files at once.  You can also hook up two camera's directly in a master - slave configuration, or connect one or multiple cameras together using a hub.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that you can use a web browser to capture, download and view images remotely.  Simply supply the IP address of the camera in the web browser.  You can also set up the camera as a media server, where images on the memory cards can be viewed on a DLNA compliant TV or digital photo frame!  It would have been nice to have wireless capability but that is a product that will need to be purchased separately.While I always use external flash whenever possible,  I would have appreciated a built in flash for those few times I am without an external flash and a direct camera flash would yield a better result.To top it off, I was happy to see the TC-80N3 timer remote control I like and use on the 7D is compatible with the 1DX.  No need to purchase another accessory, especially one that already works well.Way to go Canon!  You have helped me feel that my investment in your lenses was the right choice, as this camera is a perfect match!Update 9/23/2012:Flying in a small aircraft at 1500 to 2000 feet above a football field using the 1dx and the 200mm Canon f/2.0 lens and mostly shooting at a shutter speed of 1/2000, I captured some amazingly good clarity photos of the band players on the field.  We can recognize each specific player on the field regardless of the distance and 100 mile/hour aircraft speed.  Just make sure you match this camera with a great lens.Update 10/31/2012:I'm finding the transfer rate from camera to my laptop computer through Ethernet cable is quite fast.  Transferring large individual raw files occurs under 3 seconds.  Using cannon software, the pictures initially appear in a grid display within digital photo professional.

I've used the 1D3, 1D4, 1DS3, 5D, 5D2,  and of course over the years the majority of the 1.6x crop cameras from Canon including the 7D recently (just sold it). My interests are mainly wildlife and landscapes.I currently own the 1D4 and now the 1DX. The latter is so much better in almost every respect, I would buy another one if it weren't for the fact that on safari or for birds I sometimes need the extra 'reach' the 1D4 offers (it was an easy decision to sell the 7D instead, despite the extra crop factor).The AF is so much better, esp in AI servo mode. I have not used the 5D3, but from what I hear, despite having very similar AF, the 1DX is better for BIF. I was never very impressed with IQ of the 5 series over the 1. I used the 5D2 alongside the 1D4 in Jasper and found the 1D4 images were crisper, had better color and were overall more pleasing even though the megapixels are less.I have used the 1DX with the new 600 f4 MkII lens and it is a match made in heaven (almost). The lack of visibility of the AF point has not bothered me, although it is now irrelevant with the new firmware. The camera is heavier no doubt but still feels just right. The extra joystick in portrait mode is really useful esp when selecting AF points quickly. Microfocus adjustment is also more detailed and you can set a different number for the wide and the telephoto ends of a zoom lens. The multiple exposure mode is going to be quite interesting for landscapes, although I have not tried it yet. The two CF cards are a blessing since I can now record simultaneously on both (thought I would never need that, but for the first time in my life my CF card was corrupted recently while in camera).Finally, the battery lasts longer and the 1D4 battery and charger can be used interchangeably with the 1DX.Is it worth the price?

I shot a video at 12800 ISO, could not believe that the image had no noise, and I was shooting in very near dark environment.I read a couple of other reviews about this camera here on Amazon, most had really useful things to say, but the guy that give it one star because it did not come with a lens, is a moran.  He saved up 5 years to buy this camera.  This camera is only less that a years old, so I'm wondering what he's talking about.  Canon never sells it flag ship cameras with lenses, this is the Pro side, not the non-Pro side of the camera world, and this is where gear gets expensive, because they are better.  This is not 5D world, this camera is way beyond that, and those that but this camera without knowledge is insane.Finally the the pros out there, this camera is for you.

The people who would consider a nearly $7000 body are either professionals who will come to their own conclusions based on the specs and in-depth reviews on digital photography sites, or price-insensitive enthusiast photographers who can commit to a high-end system based on the notion that it is in some sense \"the best.\"For the benefit of the second group I will observe that there are two overriding reasons why you might have a need for this camera to the exclusion of others: (1) the fantastic low-light level performance and (2) that insane frame rate of 12 fps (14 fps if you are shooting/storing JPEGs). If you engage in low-light photography or action photography, this is the body for you (though of course low light levels and high frame rate are mutually exclusive in the real world). If you don't need the fast frame rate or will be satisfied with merely excellent low-light image capture instead of spectacular capture, you might as well consider the Canon EOS 5D, which has otherwise similar specs and is somewhat less massive at about half the price.On the other hand, massive has advantages for particular types of photography. Even with Canon's image stabilization lenses, extra weight has advantages in controlling camera shake and consequent image softness. The extra mass in the 1D X, as in other makers' high-end offerings, at least partly stems from a design that offers two independent grips and sets of control buttons. Some days you shoot landscape mode, some days portrait. No need to hold the camera in a position that may be awkward or uncomfortable to get the frame shape you want. Just rotate the body and use the other grip position and alternate buttons. Furthermore, the 1D X body is stronger and more weather resistant than Canon's other EOS bodies. If you find yourself out photographing in the wet, consider this one.Just in case you are thinking of a dual purpose body that allows not only excellent control of single images but also generation of high quality video, you should know that the similar but greatly more expensive (about $12,000) EOS 1D C (for Cinema) body offers similar single image capability plus video recording capabilities that exceed this unit's HD recording standard. The 1D C offers full 4K recording at four times the resolution of the 1D X (twice the pixels in each dimension). That doesn't mean this body is a slouch at video, because it offers full 1920 x 1080 HD capture, which is pretty good even for some professional work. But if you are a budding filmmaker who foresees the possibility of theatrical presentation of what you produce, the 4K standard is where you probably ought to be. Compare the price of Canon's dedicated video body, the EOS 500C, at somewhere around $25,000. Admittedly it is a lot more sophisticated than what you get in the 1D C body, but maybe you don't need that level of power. And if you are satisfied with HD resolution, or don't do much video work at all, there really is no reason to look further than the 1D X.I have had the 1D X body and four lenses (three zooms and a fixed length macro) for a couple of months now. I could not be happier with the body or the quality of the glass. For my purposes I know I overbought with this camera, but the truth remains: too much is always enough. And it certainly affords me room to experiment and grow.I am not a professional photographer, but I have considered myself a serious amateur for over 40 years.

Lerch", "ReviewID": "R1WM2KTLPXBNAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been saving up for some time for the Canon EOS 5D MarkIII. I wanted to upgrade from crop sensor Canon to full frame Canon. I saved the money up, and just as I was prepared to pull the trigger, along came an unexpected windfall that essentially doubled the cash at my disposal. I researched, and awaited reviews (and pre-release reviews/thoughts) for a few months to decide if I would prefer a lens and 5D MkIII or \"just\" a 1Dx.I went with a 1Dx, based on my desire to own top of the line and not be limited by the tool in my hand. I couldn't be happier.I am not a professional. I am simply a photography student and photography enthusiast that had too much money available to him when making a purchase. Moving from cropped sensor, via my 3 year old Canon XSi, to full frame, was an eye opening experience.Weight:On its own, this camera is just shy of 3.5 (3.4) lbs or 1.54 kg. It is HEAVY when compared to any cropped sensor camera. The size and weight still over shadows a crop prosumer DSLR, even with the battery grip installed (mine was roughly 1.6 lbs or 725 g and the 7D, top of the line crop prosumer, would be right around 2 lbs w/ grip).Add on a quality L series lens, such as the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM, not unheard of for wedding photographers, and you're looking at just north of 6 lbs (2.72 kg), and you have a heavy beast of a camera.And the first thing you will want to do, and in fact, I would recommend you purchase along with the camera, is to replace the poor, poor quality Canon neck strap. Yeah, the gold colored embroidery is nice, but I'm sorry, for this price you can't include a strap of a higher quality and usefulness than what's provided with Canon's \"bottom of the price barrel\" DSLRs?  I went with a OP/TECH USA 1501012 Pro Strap, which turned up only a few days ago. I plan to write up a full review on that when I have used it long enough to properly review it. This isn't just a Canon flaw. Nikon, Sony, Pentax and Olympus all suffer from poor neck straps included. Of course, most professionals that have been working in photography for years already have a brand and model strap they prefer - for those just moving to into the ranks of full frame cameras, you will definitely want to watch the strap.Ease of Use:If this is your first DSLR, you're in for a steep learning curve. If you're accustomed to a non-weather proofed Canon, you're in for a smaller adjustment. In order to keep the 1Dx properly weather resistant, Canon uses buttons for anything and everything possible. WB, ISO, etc. are all set with buttons. The dials are used for aperture and similar type function changes, but most everything is button based.Overall, the buttons, for my medium sized hands, seem to be properly and appropriately placed. I'm finding that I can have my finger on the shutter button, press the AF button and then control the little joystick on the camera without looking and by feel alone. After using the camera for roughly 2 hours in near complete darkness, I think the button configuration is about as close as you can get to perfect.The additional portrait style shutter release, which includes all of the AF functions and the dial, means battery grips aren't needed. And to conserve power, you can actually turn this function \"off\" until you need it. I'm finding I just leave it on, as sometimes I like to recompose to portrait just to see how things look. It's great to finally have a camera where this capability isn't added as an afterthought.One thing I really appreciate is the button that can be pressed to light up the 2 camera LCD displays. These are not to be confused with the LCD monitor as Canon calls it on the rear of the camera. These are the displays that show you WB, ISO, Aperture, etc. In darkness, this function is a life saver and I'm sure they've had this on previous bodies - it is my first experience with it. The orange color didn't ruin my night vision, which is an added bonus.An oversight on a camera with such a tremendous ability in near complete darkness shooting, is that none of the buttons have any lighting at all. You had better study your camera in detail and know it front to back, top to bottom, if you plan on any real night shooting. The argument could be made that this lighting could affect AF or some other camera function, but perhaps there's some way to link this to a certain length of time and when you depress the shutter button half way, it turns those lights off? Long and short of it is, if you shoot in darkness, \"know thy camera.\"AF in AI Servo mode is nothing short of amazing. There's a certain joy to mounting a high quality lens to this camera, picking it up, pointing at your chosen AF point and it takes almost no time to focus - THEN it can follow the subject near perfectly no matter where it heads. I've tried several of the AI Servo AF modes and this is where I plan to focus my learning next. The results I've gotten from just a few weeks with the camera are very good - once I know what I'm doing and which mode to use and when, I'll go from very good to great. I've captured images with this camera that my old XSi would have never been able to compete.The camera is complicated. It's not something you'll pick up and \"know\" right out of the box. It has a learning curve.Image Quality:At normal ISO ranges, 100-1600, images are high quality and sharp. I've yet, even without any processing in Digital Photo Professional (or my preferred tool, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4), had anything that needed any large amount of sharpening, if at all. Low to no noise is order of the day for these ISO ranges.Bumping into the 2000 - 12,600 range, you start to see some noise creeping in. I would say that at 12,600, the results are STILL better than the highest ISO of my old XSi (1600) and actually usable for prints. At 13x19 print size, you need to denoise a little, but they are still quite sharp at those ISOs.Bumping into the 25,000+ range, you can probably pull off 8x10 quality. At 52,000 you will want to really shrink that image if you want to print.The two \"H\" modes - 102,400 and 204,800, are essentially useless for prints. If you absolutely have to get the shot in complete darkness, this might give you a result, but it won't be decent, and it won't be something any paying customer is likely to want to pay for. It's a novelty, and I guess it's nice to have, but in real world photography, most users won't bother going there.To me, it's amazing how far we've come in just the short time since the first Canon DSLR (D30...not the Kodak rebrands) was released. ISO was 1600. 12 years later, we have a camera that is capable of 128x the ISO range. It's only a matter of time before the big camera manufacturers can offer the 204,800 ISO and actually have it usable...In terms of contrast, dynamic range and color, even discounting the 6 MP advantage over my XSi, the 1Dx provides some of the best dynamic range I've ever had the pleasure to see from a DSLR. And yes, I've used and seen RAW images from more than just my own XSiAdvantages:12 fps burst mode. The sound of this is something that simply has to be heard. It's such a satisfying sound the first time you hear it. And with AI Servo, capturing that one sport shot you've always wanted, the bird in flight, the dog mid-jump... whatever fast action you want to grab, I can almost guarantee you'll have an easier time capturing it with this camera. No doubt.Super-fast AF. This cannot be stressed enough. Mating the 70-200 mkII to this camera, picking up the camera, aiming and pressing the shutter button takes fractions of a second. In the high speed world of sports photography, this would be a heaven send.Phenomenal low light performance. I've visited the Longwood Gardens Bruce Munro Lights display twice. The first time, I took my XSi and tripod. The second time, I took the 1Dx. I captured images, albeit at 12,600, hand held, that I could only achieve on tripod with the XSi. Granted, I can't hand hold at ISO 100 and have anything usable, but the quality, even at 12,600, is more than usable for any size print I personally will want. If I can't capture the image I want now, then it's almost certainly the photographer and not the camera.Potential Issues:As others have complained, the AF points only light up when AF lock is achieved. When you shoot in AI Servo, these lights NEVER light up. The workaround that I've found that is serviceable, is to hit the AF point button, have all the points light up, choose my AF point and compose my shot keeping this point in mind. This is a rather shoddy way to have to do things, but it does work. It's quite an oversight on Canon's part, but one I can personally work around.Of course, if you only shoot during the day, this is probably less of an issue, or probably a non-issue. The hope on the Internet is Canon will fix this with a firmware upgrade. In my mind, the argument made thus far about why it is setup the way it is, is for AF and light metering. Since the viewfinder has an LCD overlay, perhaps Canon can program it so I don't know, maybe the camera can use its advanced functionality to tell how light/dark it is in the environment and keep it black in bright light, and turn it red in the dark, only lighting the single AF point in use? Not sure how well that would work on subjects moving in the dark, as it might mess up your night vision (though red is the color least likely to break your night vision).The other potential issue is it's \"only\" 18.1 MP. Yes, Nikon has an absolute MP MONSTER on its hands with the D800. I don't know how that particular camera would compare to the 1Dx, but given the lower, non-expanded ISO range, I would think it possible the 1Dx would be a better option for low light photography. The better option, on the Nikon side, to compare this camera to would be the D4 where Canon has an MP AND burst rate advantage. If Nikon comes out with a D4 speed and D3 24 MP camera, Canon will need to worry for certain. If Nikon pulls out a D4 speed and a D800 MP count, Canon is definitely going on the defensive.One more potential problem is for wildlife photographers - you can only obtain AF on 5.6 f aperture or larger lenses. If you like to shoot with a 2X extender, and a lens with a max aperture of 4 (making the max aperture effectively 8), you will want to rethink your strategy. This is disappointing, because the fast burst rate would be most wildlife photographers dream come true. Having to invest in this fast camera, and then upgrade all your glass? You're talking $1000s more. Having a \"cheap\" extender on max 4 /f has been a staple of wildlife photography life, especially where you don't want to be eaten by your subject or disturb your subject's way of life and can't invest the $13k+ on the 800mm . Why Canon went this route is beyond me. You can still MF on subjects, but at this kind of range is that really all that feasible? Why not still allow AF, but put a caveat that AF is 50% slower? I've read forum posts where third party lenses were mounted w/ extender and able to achieve, albeit very slow, AF, so it's not that it CAN'T do it, it's that it likely doesn't meet Canon's high quality standards for fast AF.Final Thoughts:By all accounts, the 5d MkIII, if you don't need the fast burst speed and enhanced AF tracking, is probably a more economical choice. If you need the extra MP count for higher quality portraits, you may be better served with the 5d MkIII.If you are a sports photographer, a wildlife photographer, or similar, weigh the price of this camera against the potential for needing to purchasing faster glass. Of course, this strategy seems to be the strategy Canon is taking on all of its DSLRs, so it may be the one thing that either has you pull the trigger to purchase faster glass, or push you to a competitor's product. From what I've read, Nikon isn't hampered by the 5.6 /f constraint (though AF is said to be slower at those ranges).I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I've already managed to capture images I would have never had the AF speed and burst mode to capture.PROS:12 fps burst (up to 14 if you lock up the mirror and don't mind JPEG)100-51,200 native ISO (expandable to up to 204,800)Images with great dynamic range18 MPCONS:AF point selection not always lit, making low light photography a bit more difficultCamera buttons aren't litAF can only be obtained with 5.6 /f or larger max aperture lenses18 MP (if you subscribe to the MP race)Recommended - though you may want to ensure you're not better served with the 5D MkIII and a better lens or two.EDIT- please check the first comment in my review, I've included links to sites that helped me decide to make this purchase, so maybe they'll be helpful to others?EDIT- There is a firmware update to version 1.0.6. It doesn't address any of the cons with the camera I've noted, but it does fix some errors (none of which I've experienced). Link is in the comments.EDIT- Canon has just released, or is set to imminently release, a new firmware that will fix the f8 AF \"problem\" AND adds RED as the color for the AF point selection while using AI Servo mode!

It has not failed me. I have specialized in photographing stage shows. This requires rapid fire, bouncing around stage pits, shooting on stages with weird lighting and moving fast. It is a heavy camera. I use a Cotton Carrier hand strap and the Cotton Carrier Camera System (a sort of vest holding my 1DX and my Canon 5 D.) In the past year there was one recall. I sent the camera back to Canon and they said \"preventive measures have been applied. Product functions were confirmed.\" I did not notice any problem but Canon saw a need for preventive intervention. I'm happy they are on top of these things. While expensive, the fact of its sturdy, solid build gives confidence that it will take rough wear. The complexity of the camera is demonstrated by the 2.5 inch thick print out of its manual which has recently been updated due to a firmware update. My one complaint is the lack of wireless ability. It has USB, ethernet & HDMI which I find  kludgy in trying to use them. Canon is good at cameras but somewhat late at the technology table.

There was the comment I did not like. The comment was that you should buy a rable for beginner with automatic settings. I totally disagree. With an automatic camera you will never learn photography. The computer gets in the way of that. My suggestion if you are a beginner and have the money this is perfect for you. Manual settings will force you to learn about the settings and set it for your self and not to be over reliant on the computer. This subject comes up again and again. We have photographers that have been shooting for years and don't know some of the basic settings or why for they have always used the automatic settings. With manual camera it will be hell for you for the first week or month but after that it will become second nature and you will count your blessings for you will learn all the basic settings. After that you wont even flinch when you have to set things for yourself. Photography is not a complicated thing when it comes to basic camera function it gets complicated when you have to think about composition and artistic levels. Also a beginner will have to go all manual anyways to learn about the settings. That is what you supposed to do in the first week and month anyways to learn how to set things or how things work.

Jones", "ReviewID": "R3JI24JGMES6XV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Canon EOS 1Dx review  9-23-2012These are just my opinions. You can love or hate them, I don't care. I do like my 1Dx.I consider myself to be an advanced amateur or semi-pro photographer. I do sell a few photos butnot enough to make a living.  This is my first impressions of the 1Dx after about two weeks ofshooting with it.It is heavier than my old EOS Mark III. The Mark III weighs 40 ounces where as the 1Dx weighs54 ounces on my postal scale. I could feel the difference the first time I picked up the 1Dx.I almost always shoot in RAW. I process all my images through Photoshop Lightroom 4.1  (LR)and only \"very\" occasionally go into Photoshop CS5. I use PhotoMatix a lot.The images coming from the 1Dx have amazing detailed and very sharp. I use eye lashes andbrows to check focus. In LR at a zoom of 1-1 eye brows have sharp edges straight from thecamera. Only LR's default 25% sharpening applied. Every pore, facial hair, and wrinkle are invivid detail. For female portraits plan on using slight skin softening.EXPOSURE. The images are under exposed by about 2/3 of a stop even with the Auto LightingOptimizer on high. With ALO disabled they are under exposed by a full stop or more. HighlightTone Priority is disabled in my 1Dx. I judge exposure by the histogram. It seldom reaches theright side. Easy fix, by Exposure Compensation or in LR. Again I'm shooting raw. Maybe Canonwill fix in a firmware upgrade.FOCUS is accurate and super sharp in good light. Focus speed is subjective. The 1Dx seems atad slower in the dark night club than my Mark III, but is more accurate. I get a greaterpercentage of tack sharp photos with the 1Dx. Again this is subjective. In good light I can't tellany difference between the two cameras.AI SERVO  I shoot a lot of dancers in a dark night club. Ambient light consist of Xmas iciclelights around the dance floor and ceiling fan lights dimmed to about 5-10 watts. I use on cameraflash. Shutter set to 1/50th, f6.3 and ISO at 500. The 1Dx has a neat AI Servo setting in the menuthat allows different focus tracking based on the speed or movement of your subject. I use the\"case 5\" setting \" For erratic subjects moving quickly in any direction.\" I get more in focus shotswith the 1Dx than I did with the Mark III, but it still misses focus frequently in this darkenvironment. Looking forward to shoot my grandson's baseball game in the daylight next week tosee how the AI Servo works with plenty of light. I discovered on my Mark III that AL Servoworks best with Automatic AF point selection mode. The same seems to be true with the 1Dx.Use the 61-point automatic selection AF, page 70 in the manual.ISO and low light.  +Scott Bourne on the PhotoFocus podcast states \" ISO 800 is the new ISO100.\" I have to disagree. At ISO 800 there is noise in the shadow areas. Remember I take photosin dark night clubs. I have tons of shadow areas and lots of black. But a 15-20% noise reductionin LR takes care of most noise even at a pixel peeping zoom of 1-1.  I did take one photo in thenight club at ISO 51200 and is was very noisy. But I was able to hand hold the camera with shutterat 1/80, f6.3.  After some LR noise reduction and other tweaks the photo is usable for newspaperand tabloid print. Took some outdoor photos of my car on a partly cloudy day at ISO 2500. Youcan't see the noise until you pixel peep at a 1-1 zoom in LR. My dark blue car with fine metalflake paint looked like large metal flake. Added 15% noise reduction in LR and it smoothed outthe paint with no detail loss. I have to do more test to see where my ISO limit is for outdoorshooting. With my Mark III my limit was 1600 ISO. Maybe Scott Bourne was talking about goodlight at ISO 800 being the new 100.AUTO WHITE BALANCE is dead on in most shots. Even standard tungsten light bulbs producegreat color. My Mark III was always too warm under tungsten on auto white balance. I have to dolittle or no adjustments in LR to correct color with the 1Dx. My Mark III was a color nightmare.CONS: The 1Dx will NOT auto focus with my Canon 100-400mm f4.5-5.6 L lens WITH myCanon 1.4 teleconverter. This is a big disappointment. My Mark III had no trouble. If your lenswith a teleconverter goes above f5.6 it stops focusing. If you use a teleconverter check out themanual starting on page 76. There is a list of Canon lenses that work with the 1Dx. I researchedthe Internet and found a work around. If you tape the last three contacts on the lens it fools the1Dx into thinking it is a different lens. The focus is much slower and hunts a bit but it doesfocus. Because of the slower focus it does not work well with AI Servo and moving subjects.To get into video mode, you have to go into the menu and then use the MF button to start and stopvideo record mode. How stupid. My wife's Canon 7D has a dedicated video button. I put the video menuin \"My Menu\" so I can find it faster.Another big disappointment, the 1Dx will not shoot tethered in LR 4.1. I'm sure Adobe willcorrect this in an 4.2 release. The clunky work around is to shoot with the Canon Utility and haveLR watch a folder. But this opens the LR importer dialog box with every photo and you have tocancel every time.
