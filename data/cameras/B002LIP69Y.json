Alston \"Wolfy Dan\"", "ReviewID": "R3RX1YWAIEGWBX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I buy and sell merchandise here and on the other auction site. So I came here to do research to sell my camera simply because I have too many digital cameras including those made by Sony, Casio, Panasonic, Canon, Olympus and Nikon.  Out of all of those cameras this one takes the best pictures and is the easiest to use.  Even when used by small children the pictures come out great.  I usually don't keep cameras very long, I usually test them out and then sell them but I have been using this camera for over a year and have had no problems whatsoever, in fact, it is my favorite camera.  There are two small drawbacks that keep this from being my overall top pick: 1) compared to some of the newer cameras it is a little thicker; and 2) When used outside in the bright sun the LCD screen gets washed out and it is a little hard to see what you are shooting.  I used it on Labor Day at the Cleveland National Air Show and because it was so sunny out, I couldn't really tell how my pictures were coming out but when I got home and put the SD card in the computer I was blown away.  I got really good pictures of the Blue Angels in flight.  In contrast my son had one of the Sony cameras and all of his pictures came out as blurry streaks.  In summary, I don't understand how so many people have gotten bad cameras but I'm sure that I'm not the only person who has a good one.  I'm very happy with my camera and I think that I will just hang on to it.  A very good inexpensive multi-purpose camera. Don't be persuaded by the bad reviews.", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "A waste of money...", "Author": "D.

Husband got me one about two years ago for Christmas! He got it a big box store around Black Friday! I use my camera about everyday! I don't really see why the others \"reviewers\" didn't like it! It takes awesome pictures! We have a 16 month old daughter  I posted two pictures of her that we used THIS camera on) and it doesn't a great job! It has this blur reduction setting and works great! As anyone with kids knows, they WON'T sit still for anything! Maybe the \"reviewers\" that say their camera shuts off or doesn't work NEEDS NEW BATTERIES!!! I love this camera and it does an awesome job for the money!!! I have even taken picture of our daughter had an online photo place make them into 14x16 prints!! This a great camera for the price!!!", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "People live to complain I guess", "Author": "coloradomom", "ReviewID": "R2FRPWYMSGNDUC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't write reviews for products and I didn't get this camera on Amazon, but Walmart. I just wanted people to know that this is a good camera to have for people that just want to take regular photos and short videos.  I don't know how many pictures I've taken in the 2 or 3 years I've had this camera, but I usually take a couple hundred every time I go on vacation. Let me add a few simple statements to explain my point:1. I use this camera frequently and it has never disappointed, as far as a point and shoot camera goes. I post pictures on my blog and Facebook and I am not a professional photographer by any stretch of the imagination. People get the bright, crisp pictures that Kodak is known to produce.2. I have children, and this camera has gotten its share of \"bumps and bruises\" and still works. I am not easy on electronics by any means. Until I got this, I went through a camera a year--everything from Vivitar to Olympus.3. This is not a video camera. You can take videos for about 30 seconds at a normal distance, but it will not do well if you try to zoom or take longer videos.4. I have taken some beautiful shots outdoors, indoors, with almost every white balance and scene (portrait, closeup, museum, sport, candlelight, sunset, etc.) setting on here. It is sometimes a nuisance to have to go through all the menus to get the perfect shot, but you usually know what situation you're going into and can preset the camera. Most pictures, however, will come out just fine in the default settings.5. I have never had any problems with the automatic focus and flash. I would advise people to not be so impatient and pay attention to what the camera is telling you.6. The camera came with Kodak Easyshare software. It is very handy and easy to use. I also load the pictures directly from my memory card to my notebook when I am away from home. I don't have any extra software, like Photoshop, either. I usually do all my editing at the picture-taking stage, so I rarely do more than upload the pictures. I am almost always happy with my pictures, and am sometimes surprised that they came out better than I anticipated.7. Just for full disclosure, I actually have the aqua version. I think this is the silver/grey one. Not my favorite color, but my husband had to replace the camera he drowned in a whitewater rafting trip. Not bad for an emergency purchase!I'm not sure why I wrote this review, other than I was surprised to see so many people were unhappy with what has become my constant companion. If anything, maybe I will keep someone from spending more money than they have to on a more expensive camera.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't bother", "Author": "John D \"John D\"", "ReviewID": "R20WTIISTOEEW1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one about 4 months ago and it failed to work after two weeks.I returned it and got another one and it stopped working today.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "S.
