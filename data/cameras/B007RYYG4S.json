{"Reviews": [{"Title": "excellent zoom, but...", "Author": "Rhonda", "ReviewID": "R18X9P1JCB0AJ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the zoom capabilities. I also LOVE that the camera recognizes which way is up, whether you take a pic in landscape or portrait orientation. No more going through the pics and having to rotate them. It's automatic!I really dislike the \"blink detection\" because you can't snap another pic right away. You have to wait for the blink detection notification to go away first. I'm still playing with the camera, and figuring out everything you can/cannot do, so maybe there's a way to adjust the duration of the notification or something, but so far, I haven't figured that out. The other complaint I have is the delay from the time you press the shutter button until the pic is actually taken. It's not a huge delay, but I have stubborn kids that I try to catch on camera, and I like to catch them right when they glance at me. They never glance long enough, or \"hold that pose\" for me, and I miss the shot due to the delay. You almost have to anticipate their glance.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$189.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix S4200 24x Optical Zoom 14 MP 3 inch LCD Digital Camera 8 GB Bundle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515Ig%2BGuCdL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007RYYG4S"}}
