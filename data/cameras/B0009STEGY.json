This camera is for shooting people, or some light landscapes and putting it in family albums. And i don't get how you can complain about the slider problem, this thing protects the lens from getting damaged. i put it in a case and it never slides off when its in my pocket.", "Date": "August 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Fabulous second digital camera to always be with you", "Author": "Man in the Middle \"strasma\"", "ReviewID": "R205Q2G9AMJKMV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently decided to supplement my Sony DSC-F828 with a second, much smaller and less intimidating to subjects camera to share with my wife. Key requirements were: small and thin but with a large LCD, zoom lens that does not protrude from the camera, and automatic dust cover.The new Sony DSC-T7 is by far the thinnest camera I could find that is any good. It is 5MP, only 1/3rd of an inch thick, has a solid lens cover and huge 2.5\" LCD , and its lens does not protrude from the camera to scare the subjects. Amazingly, it not only fits in a shirt pocket, but fits along with an iPod or Treo.If you get one, also get a spare battery, as one is only good for about an hour of use. Also get a bigger Memory Stick (Pro Duo). The largest I could find in stock was a 512M Sandisk that works fine, but if a 1GB one had been available, I'd have chosen that instead, and in the 5x higher-speed Sony version. Be sure to cover the LCD with a sheet of the screen protectors sold for Palm PDAs. Also, since it isn't water resistant, you may want to carry it in a small ZIP-lock baggie when there's any chance it will get wet.Compared to the DSC-F828, the DSC-T7 lacks an optical viewfinder, has only a 3x zoom, and a maximum aperture of F4 rather than F2 (so can't take pictures in dark areas as easily, and the resulting slow shutter can lead to blurry photos if not held very steadily.)", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "blury pictures", "Author": "Fred Fuchs", "ReviewID": "R1T7EJ5Q0XUHBV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is true that the cammera is cool looking and easy to carry around.  I tend to take more pictures since I have it with me.The problem is that everything must be perfect or the shot is blurry.  The auto focus is horrible and there is no manual override.  I have to take tons of shots and use a wall to steady the camera to ensure there is no shaking while the auto focus is trying to take a shot.", "Date": "February 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera (Sony T7)", "Author": "Paolo M.

What I hate about this camera is that when taking pictures you really have to be still or the picture would come out blurry, and using the zoom with low lighting, the pictures taken would be unrecognizable. This camera is not for indoors but taking it to the outdoors, it works perfectly fine.", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Owesome digital camera", "Author": "Celso Petersen \"Celsinho\"", "ReviewID": "R1F8HJH69QV5H5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very glad with this camera. It's portable, thin and light! Perfect to carry on your pocket everywhere you go.The only thing that is not so good is the focus. Sometimes, when you are not hanging the camera so tigthly, the photos are blurry. I think it's because the fragility that i mention before.", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0009STEGY"}}
