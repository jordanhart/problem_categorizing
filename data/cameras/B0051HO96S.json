Nor the main battery neither the 2 replacements are Canon, as well as the battery charger. However I think it's worth the price if you compare how much it costs to buy this same camera with the 18-135 by itself, no bundles.Highly recommended if you want to start in the DSLR world and don't want to worry about buying extra accessories, this kit has everything you need for ages!", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.00", "Features": "SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card Slot, 18MP APS-C CMOS Sensor\n3.0\" Clear View Vari-Angle LCD\n100-6400 ISO, Full HD Movie Mode w/ Manual Exposure\nCompatible with Canon EF and EF-S Lenses, 3.7 Frames/Second Continuous Shooting\n63 Zone Dual-Layer Metering / 9-Point AF, Intelligent Auto Mode", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i 600d Digital SLR Camera with Ef-s 18-135mm F/3.5-5.6 Is Lens, 2x Extra Lenses, 2x Extended Battery, 16gb Sdhc Memory, Hdmi Cabel, 57 Inch Aluminum Tripod and More", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ab2fKKeQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0051HO96S"}}
