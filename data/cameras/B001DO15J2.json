{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fancy Features, but still just a point and shoot", "Author": "Eric Hwang", "ReviewID": "R3I9AAY297DCL0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a Nikon enthusiast. I own two professional digital SLR bodies and several lenses, but I wanted something small to carry around when I didn't want to lug a big SLR around. You know, night on the town or anywhere where a big camera would attract too much unwanted attention. So when Nikon announced a point and shoot (P&S;) camera that supported a RAW file format, I was immediately interested. When I heard about all the other bells and whistles on this P&S;, I was determine to get one. So does it live up to all the hype? Let begin with what I liked.THE GOOD13.5 Megapixel RAW files - Yep, it's even got a higher pixel count than my D300 and depending on the settings I can get some great enlargements or a lot of flexibility to crop. With RAW files, there's more latitude for post-processing adjustments.Fully Automatic or Manual - Just like its bigger brothers, the P6000 has Programmed Auto, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority or Full Manual modes. A large selection dial on top of the camera selects the mode. The command dial near your thumb controls the selection of speed, aperture or both in manual or programmed modes. It also has specific scene modes just like Nikon's other P&S; cameras.Two User Modes - After you've customized the settings to what you like, you can save them to one of two user modes to recall anytime by just selecting U1 or U2 on the mode dial. Pretty handy.Auto or Manual Focus - Yes, manual focus on a P&S.; Select the macro/MF button and put the camera into manual focus mode and you have even more control. Another to the left of the screen activates a close up section of the screen--apparently to help focus--and also allows the same command dial that control everything else to also focus the lens. It sounds good in theory, but more about that later. Auto focus is probably easier and does a good job.Facial Recognition - Select Face Recognition for focus mode and the camera will find the faces in the image shown on the screen and put a square yellow box around each face. A half-press of the shutter and the box changes to green to indicate it's in focus. The caveat here is that the entire face must be visible for the camera to recognize it. If your subject has their face slightly turned, it won't see it.Geotagging - This is Nikon's first foray into the GPS arena and when it does work, it works well. It's not as quick in acquiring a position as the one I use on my SLR, but because it's built-in, it's always available and convenient. When you use it with good software or upload your pictures to Flickr, it proves to be very accurate. Great if you do location scouting or if you're just getting old like me and having a harder time remembering where you took a picture.VR (Vibration Reduction) - By default the VR mode is on. I can't see any reason to turn it off. Even when mounted on a tripod, it works fine and causes no problems. Of course, I haven't tried a long time exposure yet and that's usually where VR gives me problems on my bigger cameras.Optical Viewfinder - This is a rarity in this day and age, but I like to have this option when I really want to be discreet and not even have the viewfinder screen turn on. It zooms with the lens but only shows about 80% of the actual image.Decent Movie Mode - It's only TV quality and not HD, but it works for those few times I would want to record a short video. I captures the sound and allows you to zoom the lens during the movie, unlike some cameras.Ergonomic Design - The camera has enough size and weight to be substantial but not too much to be difficult to carry around. Granted, it probably won't fit into your shirt pocket, but it can certainly fit in places your big SLR won't. The camera has a magnesium front and rubberized grip and feels like a bigger camera. The buttons are, for the most part, in logical places and the layout will seem familiar to Nikon SLR owners. The one thing that I had to get used to was the zoom control. On the P6000 it's in the same place that the power control is on Nikon SLR's.Flash i-TTL Hot Shoe - You can use your big flash on this little camera. When I mount the SB-800 on this camera, it dwarfs the camera itself. I think the SB-400 would be ideal if you need more flash power than the built-in flash provides, but for most situation, I think the built-in is more than sufficient.4X Zoom ED Lens - Equivalent to a 28-112mm in 35mm format. It's more than enough for most needs. If I need more than than, I'll grab my SLR. The two ED elements do a good job of correcting chromatic aberrations.Lens Accessories - There's a screw ring that allows a 0.75X wide-angle adapter to be used, making the effective focal length about 21mm.THE BADDistortion - At the widest zoom, there is a lot of barrel distortion. You'll especially notice it when taking pictures of building or anything that has parallel lines in the image. At the telephoto end of the zoom there is just a slight amount of pincushioning. Nikon must have been aware of this issue since they've included a menu option for Distortion Control. It works, but there are limitations which I mention further in this review. At the widest zoom, there is a fair amount of image softness in the corners which I would expect in a P&S.;Noise - Even though Nikon advertises that this camera goes from ISO 64 to 6400, The usable range is effectively 100-400. ISO 64 is just too slow unless you have a tripod. Everything above ISO 400 produces too much noise. Even at ISO 800, the number of artifacts in the image starts to get distracting. At ISO 3200 and 6400, the camera automatically reduces the resolution to 3 megapixels. So you end up with a photo that's grainy from both the noise and the small resolution. In other words, barely usable. I can't really think of a situation where I would want that.Horrible Software and Mac Support - This is usually Nikon's downfall. There software is so bad, it's not even usable. As a matter of fact, I can't even use the latest ViewNX software that the installation program downloads from Nikon. Every time I try to view my images, it crashes on my Mac. The RAW format is a new Nikon proprietary format: NRW, and it only seems to work natively on Windows Vista machines. To use it on my Mac, I need to convert them using Lightroom or ViewNX...which, of course, doesn't work. I'll need to wait until Apple releases Aperture NRW support so I can use my normal workflow.Poor Battery Life - The P6000 is using battery technology developed nearly 4 years ago. It's the same battery that my old 3700 P&S; used: the EN-EL5. Good for maybe 250 shots if you don't use the flash much and turn off the GPS. With the GPS on, and updating only every 5 minutes, the battery life can be measured in hours since the GPS updates even when the camera is turned off. With all the bells and whistles this camera has, you would think they would come up with better battery technology. A spare is essential.GPS Acquisition - It takes a long time to acquire the satellites when you first get to an area and turn on the GPS. In an open area, it took over 5 minutes to first acquire. Thereafter, it still sometimes took up to 2 minutes to get a good signal. If you're inside or amongst trees or buildings, it may take even longer and even then, it may only get three good satellite fixes which means your altitude measurement may be less than accurate.Features Disabled in RAW mode - Talk about bait and switch. If you use RAW mode, many of the image adjustment features are disabled. True, you would probably do most of the adjustments in post-processing, but if the Nikon software doesn't work, how do I correct the barrel distortion since the Distortion Control is disable? Active D-lighting isn't a great loss, nor is the ISO 3200 and 6400 settings that won't work in RAW mode, but Auto Bracketing is a nice feature to lose. They don't tell you this in any of the advertising or on most of the trade sites.THE QUESTIONABLEPopup Flash - I'm not sure why Nikon did this. There was plenty of room to have the flash flush with the front. In the fully automatic mode, I would expect the flash to pop up and fire if needed, but that doesn't happen. You have to manually pop up the flash if you want flash. Some people may like this feature as an easy way to disable the flash, which then begs the question: why is there a disable option in the flash menu?Built-in LAN - Sounds like great idea until you realize that it's wired Ethernet and it only connects to Nikon's Picturetown service. Pretty much useless if you're using wireless like most people.2.7 inch Screen - There was room for a 3 inch screen but Nikon opted to use the smaller screen when everybody else is maxing out screen sizes.No Battery Charger - With such poor battery performance, you'll need an extra battery. But how to charge it? You only get an AC adapter with the camera which forces you to charge the battery IN the camera. Which means you're tethered to a wall outlet until you charge two or more batteries. Add the separate MH-61 battery charger to your shopping list.Remote Control - You can use an infrared remote to trigger the camera. Why didn't they include it with the camera though? Minor, but annoying point. (I have the infrared remote from a previous camera, but most people will not and I always find it annoying when companies make you pay extra for these little things.)SUMMARYAs a point and shoot camera, the P6000 is very good. It takes excellent pictures that you would typically use a P&S; for. But for those occasions when you want to do a little more, and you would think with all the features of this camera, it's not an unreasonable expectation that it should do a much better job. Unfortunately, even all the features have limitations if you choose to use the NRW format. And forget about making it work on your Mac.After looking at this and the Canon G10, I'm tempted to return the P6000 and get the Canon. It's priced competitively and has many of the same problems but at least it works on my Mac. But then, I'd have to give up the GPS.Should you buy one? That depends. Do you really need 13.5 megapixel RAW images? Do you need the GPS feature? Can you live with poor battery performance and the need for a charger and extra batteries? Are you willing to spend $550 for the camera and necessary accessories? If so, you might consider the P6000. You might also want to consider a D40 or D40x. But if these features are a mystery to you, you'd be better off with a much cheaper camera without all the extra features. Any of the Nikon S-series P&S; cameras or the Panasonics would do the job splendidly.", "Date": "October 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "No SLR replacement, but a good take-everywhere camera", "Author": "Michael A. Hansen \"Michael Aaron Hansen\"", "ReviewID": "RVGQVS9V5Q16T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this camera yesterday evening and have had time to play with just about all the main features. I also own a Canon PowerShot G9 so I find myself comparing the two all the time. With that said, I wasn't expecting anything with ultra low noise. The G9 noise levels are unacceptable (in my opinion) at any ISO setting over 200. Having come from this same type of CCD, I wasn't expecting miracles so I'm not disappointed. If anything, I think the noise is on par or a little less noticeable on the P6000 than it is on the G9. That was a surprise considering that the P6000 is packing in more pixels on the same sized CCD. Here's my summary:Noise = not great, but not bad at all as long as you stay ISO 200 or lower. If you go up to 400 and above, plan on using noise reduction software.Optics = not tack sharp like you can get out of a dSLR, but, again, not bad. It reminds me of a good mid-range P&S; camera in terms of optics. I think the G9 might be a little better here.GPS = great! I really love this. Two words of warning: it eats the battery quickly and it takes a while to lock on to the GPS signal (especially if you are in a city like Chicago). Once it's locked on, the GPS coordinates are pretty accurate.Speed = Good. I found the camera responsive. No speed demon, but shutter lag isn't a problem and all the camera functions are fairly snappy.Mac Compatible = 50/50. It's terrible if you're expecting native Mac support from Nikon on it's new RAW format. It's great if you're just shooting JPG images. I only use a Mac, but third-party solutions are already available to let you process the RAW files on your Mac. Lightroom 2.1 is compatible with the new format and so is Adobe's Camera RAW 4.6 plugin for Photoshop and Photoshop Elements. I've been shooting almost exclusively with RAW and happily processing them on my Mac with no problems at all.Size = GREAT! I love the size. It's just about the same physical size as the G9, but it's twice as light. It's much easier to take this camera long and stuff it into a loose pocket. You almost don't know it's there. Anything smaller would have been too small.Vibration Reduction = a must have. It really works well, especially in lower light settings.You'll enjoy this camera if you want a high-quality compact camera that has GPS, RAW and great creative control. It is a nice camera to take along with you when you just don't feel like pulling out the dSLR, but don't expect it to be a dSLR replacement because it's not. I'm quite happy with it and look forward to using it more and more.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "One Packed Little Camera", "Author": "F. Leonard", "ReviewID": "R2M4H1NFOQYWYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, this is an early review (more as I run the camera through its paces), but I must reply to the review by TGre.  If you want EVERYTHING found in a D-SLR, then you need to buy a D-SLR.  I own a D300 and use it professionally.  However, I needed a camera that I carry with me at all times and that packed as many features as possible.  This camera certainly seems to be it!  I still can't believe that this little beauty packs 13.5 megapixels, raw camera mode, aperture and shutter priority, and vibration reduction.  My preliminary photos with the P6000 are sharp, vibrant, and solid in color rendition.  I am impressed.  As for not being able to see the zoom through the viewfinder, I don't get that at all.  The wide-angle and zoom functions are clearly viewable.  Maybe TGre was referring to an accessory zoom lens.  Again, if you want an SLR, go out and buy one, don't expect a small package like the P6000, at a very reasonable price, to replace high-end professional cameras in every respect.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pro-photographer needing somthing light.", "Author": "Dangerous Fashions", "ReviewID": "R1Q3RQROR30VE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon Coolpix P6000 is a great camera.  I have two Pentax k-1000's, Nikon 808, Nikon D-100 and now this!  I had an accident In Jan 06' and since then i haven't been able to work professionally as my d-100 was too heavy for me to carry on my shoulder and hold.  I'd been discouraged with so many light weight cameras out there, too much noise, light sensors were horrible and the list went on and on.  So finally this came out and still looking after two years i found this one.  I was skeptical at first and turned off, since amateur photographers rave about the digital little point and shoots and even their cell phone cameras for that matter!  But i decided to give it a try.  Within a week i had shot over 500 pics and now have my true love for photography back.  I love the fact it has a manual focus, which really works and shows your depth of field. The colors are awesome and even has settings you can set yourself to increase your contrast and tonality.  Depending on if you are inside or outside the iso's matter.  Shooting above 800 iso w/o a flash, you will start to see some noise.  WIth flash, obviously that is eliminated.  Now i know for the pros, flash is always a huge reluctance, but ahhhh with this camera you can turn down the flash to use it as a fill light or increase it for a more dramatic affect.  You can shoot in black & white, sepia, and blue (can't remember the technical term), plus you can change the saturation on these as well, and or the contrast.  I love the wide angle, and was even surprised by the digital zoom!  Most digital zooms are worthless, but this looks pretty good and is useful.  The light sensor is great for reading available lighting and you have the option of changing your white balance and even customizing one of the WB settings.  For a little camera you have lots of control with how YOU want your photo to look like.  I am absolutely impressed!", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "First impressions : disappointing performances", "Author": "Dan \"Dan\"", "ReviewID": "R26ZVB8D45FPKX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am a big fan of Nikon and before buying this P&S;, I got a D90 which is really phenomenal.I did not have much time yet to review in details the performance of the P6000 but I want to share the first impressions I had from using it indoors for the past 3 days.I must admit the performance of this camera is extremely disappointing- Slow Focus- Slow file saving on the memory card when selecting fine+raw- Very slow continuous shooting- You need to wait 5 seconds for the flash to be ready!!! This can completely ruin the picture you want to take! You cannot ask people to stand still for 5 long seconds to take a spontaneous picture. Nikon must absolutely do something about this.After years of developments in cameras, this is simply not acceptable.I had read on the web that P6000 is not as fast as the canon G10 but I would never have imagined I would be so much disappointed.So think twice before buying this item if performance matters to you.Should you have suggestions for me, please do so and I will update this review accordingly.PS : I will update this review with more details in the coming weeks when I test the camera a bit more in other contidions (outdoors, etc).

The Coolpix P6000 is the newest addition to the P series family, replacing last year's P5100. Loaded with onboard GPS, ethernet connection, VR(Optical Vibration Reduction),13.5 Mpegs, D Lighting and wireless flash, the P6000 finally brings to the table Vista compatible raw format.Even though wireless flash has been around for a couple of years now and most notably on Olympus systems, it is still rather uncommon in point and shoot systems. As far as external lighting support goes, the P6000 operates with a single external speedlight. I am not totally sold on the wired ethernet connection but Nikon is betting that somewhere out there, someone may have the need to connect the camera to a router.Like all point and shoots, the Coolpix P6000 does have limited flash capability. For those insistent on shooting in auto mode in low light situations, the noise gremlins are indeed going to be noticeable due to a higher preset ISO. To alleviate that scenario I suggest that if auto is the preference, try shooting in a programmed auto mode. This will at least give the photographer options to work with.Unlike earlier models in the P series line, Nikon opens new doors with the NRW raw format. NRW is compatible with Vista's Windows Imaging Component codec API whereas NEF format is not. NRW format allows using raw files more transparent under the Windows umbrella. Simply put, the operating system does the format transcoding rather than the application. So much for scratching your head wondering about application support. This is a sweet bonus for amateur photographers trying to go the extra distance in achieving quality photographs. For NEF format and Nikon Capture junkies (Raw Processing Software) no worries. With all the dollars sunk into Capture software Nikon is not going to abandon NEF format anytime soon. Not as long as it remains a bankable money cow at least.Of note, the P6000 utilizes a 1/1.7-inch 13.5-megapixel CCD that supports sensitivities up to ISO 3200 at full resolution. A 4x 28-112mm optically stabilized lens does an all around sweet job. The well lit, wide view 2.7-inch LCD is standard. Taking a page from its family of DSLRs Nikon incorporates the Picture Control settings feature. Manual and semi PASM shooting modes remain the same.The onboard GPS worked well with no hiccups and is a sweet addition for allowing the user to immediately id shooting locations. Similar to its predecessor the Coolpix P5100, I still encountered a sluggish feel in between shots. Other then that, the P6000 operated smoothly in transition and delivered some great shots. As with all new digital cameras it comes down to memory card speed and quality batteries. I highly recommend SDHC cards and rechargeable batteries.Novice camera owners should remember that like all point and shoot cameras, the Nikon P6000 will only go so far. It is by no means a DSLR and does have limitations. Point and shoots are all about convenience. Overall, I remain quite impressed with the Nikon Coolpix P6000.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Point & Shoot", "Author": "J. R.

For those of you not old enough to remember, I can assure you that back in the Nikon F days of the late 60's & early 70's the 35mm rangerfinders were a compromise vs the SLR's too! That what this camera is, a compromise between a DSLR and a DP&S; (glorified digital instamatic).This is actually the first digital P&S; camera I have ever owned, but have in the past owned a D-70 and currently have a D-200 with the extra battery pack and many Nikon lenses including the 300 2.8 (which weighs a ton.But I needed a very small HQ camera that would fit in my pocket, give some of the creative control I wanted, be durable and most of all be one 20th the weight of my other camera gear so I would carry it with me all the time and the P6000 has filled that need.In the last week and a half, I have given this little camera a great workout and tried every control feature, every image quality feature, time lapse, GPS & more and have had better than good results in many different modes and conditions leading me to say I am more than happy with this camera because I didn't expect too much and judged it on it's own merits.It will require a bit tweaking to get the image you want but it is well worth it in the end and that is one part of photography I have always liked the best, playing around with the equipment until I get the results I want!I agree the GPS is semi useless inside a building and the battery life could be better but overall I like this little camera and really enjoy having it with me at all times to capture life's unexpected moments.", "Date": "November 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "NIKON COOLPIX 6000", "Author": "B.

If you are looking for a point and shot camera that feels professional this is the right camera for you. I have done amateur photography with SLR and now with DSLR (I own a D40X) but I needed a smaller camera that I can easily carry with me with most of the DSLR features (you know, you want to feel in control of the camera rather than the camera in control of you). I was looking around and tempted to get Lumix DCM LX3, I went to the store, play with Lumix and Canon and I decided to get the P6000. So far it has performed very well, the camera was designed for those who are used to manipulate a DSLR, it feels professional, much more than the Lumix does. Besides all the features that you can find in other reviews I wanted to add 10 that I found extremely good:1. 1:1 format (square) photograph format. I know you can crop images later but I found this format good to play with2. Monochrome filters3. BSS (Best shot selector)4. Multi-shot 16.  This is a very cool feature that takes 16 consecutive shots and groups them in one single image.5. Auto bracketing (not even my D40x has most of this features) with several exposure options6. Face priority focus mode7. Wide Angle Converter. It works great and if you compare it with its competitors no one offers this wide-angle (21mm for 35 format). If you take photographs of interior spaces and architecture in general you will like this feature. The distortion control minimizes the barrel distortion effectively.8. Viewing pictures by date9. Voice Memo for each of your photos (you can attach a 20sec memo) and voice recorder!10. My Menu. Customized menu access on the back by the screen.This camera is a very fun camera with a lot of features and with the feeling of a professional one. Very well constructed and with an intuitive interface (especially if you have worked with Nikon before) You can be in control of everything and you can place it in your pocket too!As I mentioned before, I do not regret obtaining this camera but the opposite.

My main purpose was to photograph landslides, geologic formations, karst terrain, historical monuments and other features along the river and side trips. Without lugging around a separate GPS unit, I wanted to know fairly accurately where my photos were taken. The Nikon P6000 performed without failure, especially since some sections of the river were not visible due to fog, and it was easy to get lost. Even in the narrow, deep canyons of the Three Gorges, the GPS unit was able to detect 6 to 12 satellites. Before the trip, I tested the camera at home, and found the GPS accuracy to be 20 to 50 feet horizontally, accurate enough for my purposes. The accuracy is largely due to the satelite signal frequency and the Nikon P6000 runs on the low commerial frequencies, not high frequencies which allow high accuracy such as surveying and military frequencies. To save battery life, one needs to shut off the GPS function when not taking outdoor photos. Purchasing extra rechargeable batteries is recommended.When I got back home, nearly all of my outdoor photos could be uploaded to Google maps, showing the location of the photos. The Nikon camera and included software worked flawlessly.My next objective is to purchase a SLR camera with built-in GPS capability.Gregory T. FarrandEngineering GeologistSan Diego, CA", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sophisticated point-and-shoot with lots of features", "Author": "Busy Executive", "ReviewID": "R2L200N2QWXVFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many of the other reviewers in here, I was shopping for a point and shoot to supplement my DSLR, and the P6000 stood out as the ideal candidate.I like the Canon G10 and a few others, but I use Nikon's DSLR cameras and the P6000 feels more comfortable and familiar to me. Nikon's intuitive menusing system and well laid out controls are actually a major advantage, especially if you're already familiar with them. I felt confident with even the advanced features of the P6000 with nothing more than a glance at the instructions. Can't say this about most of the competitors.As for image quality, so far I've been pleasantly surprised. Nikon kept the lens zoom range fairly low (4x), which generally adds up to better picture quality. It's also a fast f/2.7 at the short end of the zoom range, giving you more flexibility in lower light situations. It also takes amazing close-ups. Mine seems sharpest in the middle of the zoom range, showing a bit of distortion (curved lines) at the short end, and fuzziness in the corners at the long end, coupled with some flare when shooting into any type of light and purple color fringing if you look at the image close-up. I'd rate all these defects as minor - overall, I'd say excellent lens performance for a point-and-shoot.Still, many people are lured in by the megapixel count, but in reality, point-and-shoot cameras have too small a sensor to take advantage of all those dots. On the small sensors, the pixels are packed too close to each other, to a point where the lens really can't make much use of them, and this gets more noticeable at higher ISO settings. If you're thinking  the 13.5M pixels in the P6000 compare directly to, say, a DX D300 or FX D700 (12MP), you're in for a surprise. But for prints up to about 8x10, taken in good light with proper technique, there's not a huge difference between the P6000 and a DSLR.The P6000 has a ton of sophisticated features, some I find useful and others not. On the positive side:- The image stabilization works well (nearly as well as that found in Nikon's pro lenses).- The built-in GPS is handy, although it only works outdoors and takes a few minutes to acquire a strong signal. If you're the type who turns the camera on, takes the picture, then turns it off, you'll find you almost never get GPS data. Turn it on and leave it on.- The camera can generate RAW images, resulting in a bit higher quality than JPGs, although the files are much larger (so you'll want bigger/more memory cards).- The accessory flash shoe is very handy, although most of Nikon's add-on flash units are larger than the camera itself. Still, considering that I own several Nikon flashes, this comes in handy.- Wide range of manual adjustments and controls, although the camera takes generally wonderful pictures on full-auto mode.- The built-in Ethernet connection is also great when you want to share pictures but don't want to lug a computer around. Plug the camera into an Ethernet cable and your pictures are automatically uploaded to Nikon's \"My Picturetown\" site (you can also use something called a wireless Ethernet bridge to do this wirelessly)I can find few negatives to complain about, but among them would be:- High ISO performance isn't very good, mostly due to the small sensor. Nikon is dreaming with ISO 6400 - I wouldn't use anything above 400 if I were planning on getting a high quality result.- Battery life is somewhat less than ideal. Since I tend to leave it on so it can get good GPS signals, the battery tends to drain quickly. Plus, the built-in LCD panel is very high quality and must draw quite a bit of power. Add to this the relatively small size of the batteries and you find yourself with not a lot of shots per charge.- Although the camera generates RAW images (a positive), the raw file format is different than Nikon's NEF format used in Nikon's DSLRs. This required additional software and plugins, although eventually I was able to get it all working properly.- There's a fair bit of lag time between when you press the shutter button, and when the image is actually taken. This is a common problem in all of the point-and-shoot cameras I've used, but if you're used to the near-instantaneous operation of (say) a D700, it can be a bit annoying.- Although it's a small camera, it's not quite small enough to fit into a pocket.Overall, I'd say that I'm very happy with the camera and it's exceeded my expectations in every regard.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "An overall solid camera with good potential", "Author": "S. Ho", "ReviewID": "RTY27F8817H1J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "About my background:  I have had the P6000 for about 3 months now and have probably taken over 1000 photos on summer travels, local excursions, and family gatherings.  I am not a professional photographer, though I can put myself somewhere along the lines of an advanced amateur (not sure I would say that I am an \"enthusiast\" without having used RAW/photoshop- at this time I only shoot in jpeg).  My review is basically geared towards those who would like to have the option to have more control than a simple point-and-shoot, without the bulk and complexity of a dSLR.  I have owned a film SLR in the past, and found that after the initial novelty of the camera wore off, I rarely used it because of its bulk/weight.  Since the onset of the digital camera, I've rediscovered the excitement of photography with the convenience and portability of point-and-shoot cameras (afflicted with an unhealthy addiction to electronics, tempted by newer features, increasing megapixels, etc, and having gone through about 5 digital P&S; cameras over the years before the P6000...).  As other reviewers had done, I researched other models of \"enthusiast\" cameras, including the Canon G10, Panasonic LX3, etc, but for personal reasons I decided on the P6000.  I am overall pleased with my purchase, but that is not to say I didn't encounter some frustrations as well.  My current P6000 is actually my \"third\" P6000.  Having ordered the camera through Amazon, the first supplier shipped the camera with an obvious defect on the lens surface.  I thought it was just bad luck until my replacement from Amazon itself was another camera with another surface coating defect on the lens, this time more prominent than the prior!  The defects were significant enough that with certain types of lighting it will show up on the photo/video itself.  Thankfully the return policy with Amazon was relatively painless, and the third camera shipped with a normal lens (though there is a tiny dead pixel on the LCD screen, which is supposedly within \"acceptable\" manufacturing variation, and not on the actual images taken).  Evidently quality control on these cameras is not what it used to be...  The camera itself is otherwise very solidly-constructed, physically comfortable to use, and I have grown to really enjoy using it on a regular basis.  It can take some amazing images, but not without a learning curve (with repeated consultations of the users manual to remember settings/options, test shots for exposure/saturation/sharpness, etc).  The customizable menus are handy, but manual focus (of which I was initially excited of the capability) is usable but awkward, unrefined, and limited at best.  I have found that images up to ISO 200 can be quite good, but as with other cameras with similar type sensors, ISO 400+ should only be reserved for images where image noise isn't a big deal.  Some shutter and processing lag prevents this camera from being able to capture good \"action\" shots (unless you are aiming for motion artifact qualities in your images).  With the help of a steady hand or object when needed, I have however, been able to capture some pleasing low lighting shots at ISO 200 with acceptably low noise and good clarity (I have uploaded some samples from recent travels).  Focus on this camera is a little hit-or-miss, face recognition is helpful with people, but I often need to switch modes to prevent misfocus if going from people shots to still object shots, etc.  Some pics that I thought were focused (even with directed center autofocus) ended up with the focus adjacent to where I had targeted- a bit frustrating at times, but overall less frequent as I gradually become more accustomed to the camera.  Otherwise the images produced when the right elements are in place can be quite impressive, and the ability to have more control over shutter speed, aperture, saturation, sharpness, and exposure allows for creative opportunities.  Battery life isn't stellar, but day trips are quite manageable with a spare battery (external charger recommended, since it's not included...), and even better when using an external flash.  The Nikon speedlight SB400 external flash was a little splurge for me, but it worked seamlessly with this camera to take some excellent indoor photos with indirect bounce flash.  I admit that I have not used the GPS option (I didn't purchase the camera for this option and have not been interested in exploring it at this time), so I cannot comment on its performance.  Video, though not HD, is fine and usable.  Overall, I am quite satisfied with the P6000, despite some limitations and inconsistencies.  Even though it takes some great pictures in its Auto or Scene \"point and shoot\" mode, I can say that this is a camera capable of so much more for those that are willing to take the time.  Many people seem to want a camera that automatically produces magnificent images with every press of the shutter, but with such a minimal effort camera, I'm not sure if I would feel the satisfaction that I had \"captured\" that image myself (since anyone else in the same setting could have pressed the shutter with the same camera and got the same image without much effort).  I actually enjoy the challenge of trying different settings & options to capture an image that pleases me.  By taking the time to learn this camera, knowing its limitations and potential, and using my creative outlet and photographic eye, I find myself enjoying the end result that much more.  I'm sure many others would be able to say the same and more about their own \"enthusiast\" cameras (such as the Canon G10 or Panasonic LX3), but  as someone who enjoys the beauty and challenges of digital photography, the P6000 fits my needs well by offering a solidly-build, high quality camera that allows me the flexibility to exercise my creativity and produce some stunning images.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera....when it works", "Author": "Roger A.

I love the time-lapse feature which I still want to play with, but have not yet. GPS is a little slow to acquire a signal sometimes, but that's only a minor irritation in the big scheme of things. Here's the problem: Three-quarters thru my vacation, I noticed a black out of focus spec on the top right area of all the pictures. Depending on the zoom setting, it would be clearly visible or almost completely out of focus and not that noticeable.  I think some dirt may have gotten inside of the camera, but I'm not sure. There was nothing on the lens. Therefore, I sent it in for warranty work. Here's where the problem started. It took 2 MONTHS to get the camera back. The service website showed \"Awaiting Parts\" most of that time.  When I finally DID get it back, the problem was fixed, but they managed to break the GPS function while it was apart for repair. The camera no longer received any GPS signals whatsoever.  So, I sent it back again, with a detailed letter explaining what they apparently did. I also said that I've lost confidence in this particular unit and would they mind please replacing it outright.  I got the camera back in about 3 weeks. The invoice showed that they replaced some more electronics, but apparently nobody bothered to take the camera outside to verify that it now receives GPS signals. It doesn't.  They did not fix the problem.  And they used a completely beaten-up and ripped box to ship it back to me. They simply taped over the damage with extra tape and stuck a shipping label on it.

During the summer of 2009, i biked across America with this camera.  And later today, I leave for Tanzania for 5 weeks to climb Kilimanjaro (I'll update this review with this camera's performance).  I have had a lot of time to go seriously in depth with this camera, and there are things I love, and things I loathe.BUILD QUALITY: you can't really tell from the pictures, but it is built like a tank.  The body feels like it is mostly metal, a blessing on my bike trip where I had one serious accident that the camera fortunately survived (the back wheel of my bike on the other hand, did not do quite as well).  The buttons feel a little mushy, but other than that, its a solid camera.SCREEN: it's not huge, but it gets the job done.ISO: this is not a strong point of the camera, at the low end, the noise is negligible, but once you start cranking up the ISO, you get a lot of noise.PICTURE QUALITY: the picture quality is pretty good, however, unlike Nikon DSLR's it does not boost the contrast to the famous \"Nikon Standard\" in camera.  I wish it did, but it all comes down to personal preference, and editing can be done back on a computer.GPS CAPABILITY: this was one of the first cameras with GPS built in, and it is, to say the least, \"meh.\"  It takes an absurdly long time to get a lock, and don't even think about trying to get a lock indoors or anything less than an open field.  And try not to move either, it will throw it off.  But fortunately, once it has a lock, it is very stable and it is very hard for the camera to lose the lock.BATTERY LIFE: it is a pretty bad battery, not a newer generation type, and the inefficient GPS module kills it quickly. I have higher hopes for the [hypothetical] P7000 in this regard.OVERALL: a meh camera, but that's what you get for being on the cutting edge.  Hopefully the P7000 will have a superior GPS chip, a better battery, and less noise.  if they can do that, i would buy it on in a heartbeat.

I have the used the camera for over a month.  Picture quality is good.  Usability is fair.  The image capture time is very slow slow which means you can't shoot several pictures in rapid succession.  The power on/off switch is poor and often has to be pressed several times.The fatal flaw however is the GPS which is so insensitive that it simply doesn't work.  In the entire time I've used the camera I have gotten a GPS lock only once.

It excels in good light at ISO 100 to 400.  I've set the color enhancement to vivid as I've done with my Canons and the colors come out rich and beautiful!  If too much color or I want B&W;, I make changes via iPhoto - a very simple process.  The photos are crisp, clean and the camera focuses quickly and very well.Low light situations will require a tripod and some manual adjustments.  If it goes over ISO 400, the noise is miserable and the photo is virtually worthless.  To avoid that, you will need to use a tripod , which I have only done a couple times since my Canon S2IS does a better job in low lights.The GPS does take some time to obtain a signal so does not work right away.  When it works, it works very well.  To that end, I can just add the basic location data to the photos that are missing the information through my software when I download the photos to iPhoto.  It's not difficult but can be time consuming.  Sadly, I think this was Nikon's first and last consumer level GPS enabled camera.  They should have worked on improving it instead of only developing the one model.The pop-up flash works fine.  I've seen some complaints about it but I have no issues and find it adequate in normal situations.Movie mode is a great disappointment.  The microphone does not pick up sound very well and the video quality is just ok.  My Canon S2IS does stereo recording and allows the full use of the 10x optical zoom lens during video recording.  This newer camera appears to only allow digital zoom.  Oh well.Overall, I love this camera and have no regrets and will keep it for a long time.

There are more features than necessary on this camera (two user settings, the 'mypicturetown' direct download crap, and the GPS, although the geo-tagging GPS feature is still novel to me). If you are a price-sensitive consumer like me, and your cameras break down within a year, this camera is less expensive than the Canon G 10 and it feels more rugged. (also, the digital zoom seems to work much better than any other camera I've previously owned).", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Coolpix P6000", "Author": "James L.

I am your every day user.Eric Hwang has put most of the concerns I have about this camera.  I have only had this camera for about three hours now and see the power and GPS issues he talks about.  I need to take pictures at remote radio sites on public land.  I wanted to be able to know where the picture was taken.  I order to find the name of the mountain and name of the site after a week or two on the road.I wise that Nikon would have used the USB power as a charger too.  With the GPS on the battery life is short.  I think it was about two hours just sitting on the table connected to my laptop.  The owner's manual tells you to turn on the GPS off when the camera is not in use so that it does not run the battery down.The software that comes with the camera is not as good as the FREE software that comes with Canon's P&S; cameras.  Nikon wants you to pay for their program called Capture NX 2.  I have not used it yet, so I don't know why I would pay for the program yet.My needs for the options that don't work nicely on this camera may cause me to send it back.  I will test this camera out for a day or two once I get the memory card, camera came with little internal memory.  This is my first and may be my last Nikon.

I don't mean to sound pretentious, but I have more of an \"artsy\" interest in photography.Admittedly, I did not go into each and every feature of this camera.  The reason I purchased it sight-unseen was because how happy I'd been with my Coolpix 8800 and I liked the idea of a higher number of megapixels as well as the option of a wide-angle lens.I read the overview Nikon had written prior to release of the camera and I swear it stated that the P6000 would have the viewfinder with the diopter adjustment, just as the 8800 has.What a disappointment!  The viewfinder's only purpose is for looking through if the ambient lighting is so bright you can't see the camera screen (which drove me crazy cleaning off fingerprints); it doesn't show the zoom, the display of your settings, or the review of your pictures.  If you have the wide-angle lens attached, part of the viewfinder is obscured.Maybe I need an upgrade as far as cameras, but it's very difficult for me to frame a picture without that viewfinder. And by the way, what's up with the \"borders\"?  Never did understand why they included that feature.The wide-angle lens was a disappointment as well.  Even though I made sure to follow the directions insofar as telling the camera that it was attached and checking the \"Distortion\" control, my pictures really did not come out as I would have expected - they did appear to have kind of a fish-eye look to them.The camera is MUCH smaller than the 8800 and although it feels well-made, it just doesn't feel substantial.  Having to purchase the battery charger so your camera's not out of commission was a negative for me as well.  You definitely need a 4GB card.Also, (as I said I didn't investigate it thoroughly so please feel free to disagree with me), I didn't like the fact that the software that comes with the camera is for Nikon's PictureTown - I liked the old system where you could download your pictures and edit them with Nikon's simple, but effective program.Anyway, I'm sure a lot of people will be happy with the P6000, but I felt that I could have gotten just as good of a camera for $200 as the P6000.  In fact, I had just helped my girlfriend choose a camera since she's new to the digital game, that had 12mp, face recognition, etc. for $195!Hope no one's put off by my experience, but this is my 2-cents' worth: The camera just did not meet my expectations.I've returned it and all the accoutrements I purchased for it.
