{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Foscam Cameras good value for casual use", "Author": "E. COMER", "ReviewID": "R2DJVDKPTN42IJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Over the past year I have done a lot of work with network IP cameras including high-end commercial models from Axis Communications; mid-range units from Panasonic and budget cameras from Foscam. I have worked extensively with three Foscam camera models - FI8918W Pan/Tilt, FI8909W-NA fixed camera and the FI8904W fixed outdoor model. All of these cameras were purchased directly from China rather than from Amazon, because Amazon did not offer them when I made my purchases, however, Amazon's price is very good and I would purchase any future units from them.The Foscam cameras are made by Foscam Intelligent Technologies Co., Ltd. in Shenzhen, China. Their website is often down, apparently due to China's  pervasive interference with its Internet service. Despite this, Foscam's support via email is quite responsive considering the time difference.These cameras have proven reliable after months of service both indoors and outdoors. All of the camera models have been installed outdoors in semi-protected locations, such as under a building eve and the model FI8904W has weathered a less protected location where only the rear of the camera was shielded from rain. Note: only the front of the  FI8904W is water resistant, despite what the brochure says.These cameras are consumer grade with a small sensor and a plastic lens. Display resolution is modest at 640 x 480 Pixels (300k Pixels). They are adequate for general observation and surveillance and are especially good for monitoring a home interior. You can test drive a Foscam FI8918W camera installed in Russia at this link: [\u2026] Login using Server Push Mode as user  demo and a password of demo. You can fully control the pan/tilt. Personally, I recommend that you never use the ActiveX mode - it is, in my opinion, buggy.All of the Foscam cameras come with infrared LEDs built-in the camera face. This enables night vision in black & white. The  FI8904W model is particularly good at seeing in the dark, given its large array of infrared LEDs. The manufacturer claims 20 meters of visibility. I can say that a pitch black 20x20 foot room will appear as if the room lights are on in the FI8904W 's video.The builtin software enables multiple cameras to be linked through its built-in web page, creating a single monitoring center for multiple cameras. A demonstration of this feature can be seen on YouTube at:[\u2026]One issue is that to save cost, Foscam cameras lack the switchable infrared filter found in more expensive IP network cameras. As a result, the colors of images and videos will not be true, primarily concerning the color green. Plant foliage will appear gray. Given the camera's security goal, this isn't a big issue to me.All Foscam cameras have built-in software supporting a motion detector feature that can be scheduled by day of week and time of day, in fifteen minute increments. When active, detected motion will cause six time stamped (in the filename) still photographs of what caused the motion to be emailed to the email address of your choice. It supports access to smtp mail servers, such as Yahoo but not SSL servers, such as Gmail.Lastly, configuring any network IP camera, not just Foscam, is not plug and play and Foscam's little  instruction booklet is minimal. Help exists on  Internet forums like [\u2026]", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great so far but wish it had some features", "Author": "JayJay \"Bovie Muff\"", "ReviewID": "R3QN4MB33MQ4XU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had it for about a week so far and bought it to really monitor my dog's behavior while I'm away.  The infrared beam is excellent especially now with the dark winters.  In fact the beam reaches pretty far and the picture at 640x480 looks very clear.I had a Compro IP60 stationary camera before and one thing I really liked about it was I could point my Blackberry to an RTSP address and it'll stream right to the phone (when it worked that is).  With the Foscam it seems I'm dependent on purchasing an IP camera program.  Two I saw in the app store cost $15 or more but I tested out Total Control which is $6 for a 4 camera version.  It seemed to work and has options to pan the camera but my experiences showed my camera just moving on its own with me having no control whatsoever, even connected via wi-fi on the same network.  Because of that I won't try to pan it at all since you'll just wind up staring at a wall.The audio is incredibly clear, although only available with IE, and with minimal lag.  The Compro IP60's audio has a lot of lag and there's a lot of clicking sounds, like relays going off inside, before and after which is pretty annoying so I was happy this didn't have any of that.I read a lot of reviews about this before getting it and I'll just say that if you're technically inclined and can read the words on the web GUI, you don't even really need any instructional book at all whatsoever.  I had the thing set up and going just by looking over all the settings.  It's actually all quite simple so jump right in.The other complaint people listed was ActiveX crashing a lot with Win7 64bit.  Mine crashed often too but one day when I had it in compatibility mode it seemed to work perfectly.  Today though it's crashing again.  Kind of sucks since it's so inconsistent.  Hopefully a web UI update will fix this soon.Currently I'm using a Synology DS409 with its Surveillance Station to record video but it doesn't fully support the 918 yet.  I can pan and tilt and all but there is no audio.Overall it's pretty nice.  I intend to buy a second one so I can monitor more areas in my condo.  The infrared beam only turns on when it gets dark so you don't have to worry about wasting energy.  Even in the night though you have the option of turning it off altogether.  All in all pretty nice but due to lack of HTTPS, and the fact I leave it on all the time, I don't port forward to it but instead use an SSH server to connect to and then tunnel to the camera.  Now all my data is encrypted with an incredibly complex passphrase.The one feature I wish it had was some sort of pan limit settings for the patrol.  It will scan side to side or up and down but all the way to the ends.  I wish it had numbers displayed for its pan location and somewhere you can enter in a min and max range.  I really don't need it to patrol the two walls I have, since it goes 300degrees, just down the two hallways.  It's like limiting sticks for a machine gunner position.  There's just a lot of wasted motion when it goes well beyond where it really needs to go.And yes, my dog is freaked out by it when it moves and I fear I'll have video of her attacking it some day but that'd be worth the $92.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "NTS ( Not too shabby)", "Author": "a_justice", "ReviewID": "R26A5675VC03RW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I purchased this product I was expecting a heap of crap I would just throw in the trash can. Day three of having it, I am pleasantly surprised. There are, although, a few stipulations to my 4 star review. I work in IT and have for quite awhile, that said, if you are not technically savvy, do not buy this. You will be lucky to get the installation cd to work correctly. After installation of the software I found that the start menu shortcuts and desktop shortcuts didn't even point to the product *.exe. This was an easy fix after searching for it. Once that was fixed I was quick to learn the OEM software doesn't even work ( for me, your experiences may differ. I am using Win7 x64). I quickly trashed the DVD, obtained the IP address of the camera (of which you must plug into your network through Ethernet cable first) from the DHCP client table on my home router and just visited the built in web server via chrome(the web site works with all major browsers, I have tried it on IE, chrome and fire fox). From this point it was easy. I quickly set it up on my wireless from the website. Skipping the technical details, once setup, I was quite pleased with the quality of video and all the feature that came OEM. If you are a technical person and able to throw some time to setting it up, I would recommend it. For the price, I wouldn't buy anything else.**A side note. I am not a fan of thieves. We recently had our vehicles broken into in the middle of the night. That said, my objective when buying this camera and basis of the review, revolves around the idea that I would be able to be better guarded against future thieves/ scum of the earth. I hope this helps for those of you in the same boat.Suggestions you might find helpful.---Router- Disable mac address filtering.- Assign a static IP to or reserve a DHCP IP for the camera.- If you want to access the camera remotely, forward an obscure port (ideally not 80 as most consumer plans block this)to the camera's IP. ( you must also make the proper changes on the camera for the port change)---Third party software- Make use of it. The VLC plug in does not work as it should. I spent a long time figuring out why I could not use the two way audio from the website. I just installed IP Cam Viewer on my phone and Ispy IP Camera Viewer on my laptop.- Recording works best from a third party solution. To my understanding recording with the OEM setup is done through active X in IE. If you as me this is a crappy solution and doesn't allow full use of the features.- As a rule of thumb, if you get frustrated with the OEM solutions, don't even bother.--- Remote viewing- Just break down and buy the dydns solution. It is built in and works well. It will save you from the frustration of trying to use a free solution. Plus it updates automatically when your outside IP changes.- Be aware of ISP port blocks. My ISP (like most) blocks port 80 (which is default for all HTTP and this camera). It is easy enough to change the port access on the camera, then forward all port X requests to that camera. Then of course if you have to take everything to far like me and don't want to type in website.com:X everytime, just setup a redirect from dydns. i.e. redirect requests to website.com to website.redirect.com:X. **Quick tip. Don't use cloaking when you redirect. This makes everything on the camera's website \"undefined\".Hope this helps for those of you who are on the fence. 4 solid stars and a great buy for the price.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not be tricked into buying a Look Alike", "Author": "Whatmorecanyousay \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R17IBR6ORWW0J8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There. are exact replicas of this unit on the market at less than 50 dollars.They Stink.

There is a bonus with this unit it has eyes, ears, and a voice.You can say thank you to the UPS person from 500 miles away and he thinks yourin the house. The voice is not so hot from a 1 inch speaker. The software forAndroid phones is available at the apps store. The best is free for testing butwhen you get to more than 1 camera the very best is IPCam by Robert Chou.He upgrades and takes in most camera specs so that you have only one tap and allof your cameras in different locations come up on the screen because all of the key strokesare put into the on board application for each camera and the camera mfg specs are alreadyin the application.

It was a bit complicated to install it. Make sure that after you install the software on Windows 7 that you change the path for the desktop camera icon (it is on the instructions).  Also do not panic if the tilt controls do not appear on the software itself.  You need to upgrade the firmware on the camera and then upgrade the software user interface (also on the instructions.)  Great quality in low light. I was impressed with the speed you can tilt the camera.  Works on Iphone, Android.  There is a rubber coat around the body of the camera and base. Wall mount is a plus.

NOT the case with this camera -- I had it up and running wirelessly in less than half an hour (and I can't claim all my attention was devoted to camera installation during that period; it could be done more quickly if one weren't distracted, I'm sure!)  I configured it by the desk, but then decided to move it to a window to look at something interesting.  Held my breath a little when I plugged it back in -- could it really be this easy? -- but it still worked!  The camera does go into automatic panning once you turn it on/plug it in, and it does take about 60 seconds for the video to register at the controller software/network browser.Like most wireless devices that don't have keyboards or other methods to input wireless keys, you need to plug the camera into a wired network port to setup the wireless.  There are included printed Quick Installation Guides for both Mac and Windows OS,but I would recommend using the manual on the included CD -- it is SO much easier to read!The pan and tilt are just a hoot to use and the range of motion is quite extensive.  The camera control utility on the PC allows you to set the \"patrol speed\" as well as how far the camera pans and tilts while it is \"patrolling\" (or you can tell it to just be still!).  When I opened the box, my husband said \"Oh, you bought the one without zoom.\"  Hm.  That was the first I realized I had done that -- there were so many features from which to choose, and I was trying to be budget-conscious.  However, while I can't zoom, the camera resolution is good, and I feel we can see both close and distance.  The color is also good.  The camera control menus are extensive and not always totally intuitive to use -- a \"what is this?\" function would have been really nice if you weren't going to actually include help.  However, there is that manual on the CD! Setting up email to get alerts would be next to impossible without the manual, but is quite easy with it.To use the audio, I had to download a free utility (link is provided on the camera control menu).  Audio fidelity is not the most fabulous -- if you were using this to record anything critical, well, I wouldn't.  However, I am confident it will be fine for our purposes.I'll update this review when we've had a chance to try the \"night vision,\" and motion detection.  It's interesting that the motion detection seems to come with a scheduler, as in \"ignore motion during regular activity hours but pay attention during this period when we don't expect much to be going on.\" Our intended target is figuring out how raccoons are getting into the barn so that we can prevent them from getting into the barn, and we need to extend our internet up there before we can use the camera for that.

Mills", "ReviewID": "R2NH5N399GXAJY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall this is a great webcam that is easy to use.I bought this webcam to track how often my wife sleep walks at night.  With the night vision, motion detection, programmable motion detection times, and FTP image upload it is perfect.  I consider myself a \"techy\" type of person so I didn't have any issues with configuration.  I also have my own domain with web space and FTP access.  You could probably run a simple FTP server on a local computer and have the images transferred to that local computer.  The motion sensitivity is adjustable (1-10), by default it was set on 8 and picked up way too much of us moving in our sleep.  We finally settled on 5, it gets the larger movements in our sleep and every time my wife sleep walks.The motion detection is programmable on a per day basis on 15 minute increments.  This makes for a nice visual display for when images are uploaded.The pan, tilt, and zoom feature is really nice.  This thing is so quiet when it moves, our dogs can't even hear it.  The built in speaker and microphone are average at best but they do work.  The speaker can sometimes have a little echo.  Which really freaked my dog out the first time I tried to talk to them.I would have given it 5 stars but it does lockup when viewing the feed with a desktop computer and web browser for long periods of time.  It then has to be manually restarted which is a pain.  Camera works flawlessly when using the Android app tinyCam.  All the features of the camera can be controlled using this app.If you want to use this camera over your broadband connection you need to be familiar with opening ports on your router and assigning an internal static IP address to the camera.

You just connect it to your home wireless network router and follow the instructions included on the CD. Once it's correctly setup, you can mount it anywhere you want as long as its within the range of your wireless network.Not only can you watch your webcam on your home PC, but you can watch it on ANY PC, anywhere in the world (Internet Access Required of course). You can also watch your webcam on your Smartphone by purchasing any of the Apps that are available.The webcam can pan left to right and up and down, you can even use the available function buttons that, once setup, you can pan and/or tilt the webcam to any position with the push of one button. Depending on the Smartphone App, you may have up to 11 presets? The only thing this webcam can't do is zoom in or out, but again, depending on the Smartphone App, you can pinch & zoom the image which works just as good.The webcam also has infrared lighting so you can see the image on the webcam in darkness or very low lighting. The PC software and the Smartphone Apps give you many other types of setups so you can customize you webcam viewing. Overall, this Foscam webcam works so well, I ended up buying two.... and I'll be buying a 3rd webcam soon!I'm very happy with this product so I give it 5 out of 5 stars!

Hofstetter", "ReviewID": "R1Y8T7U6O9DYZH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchased a few different wifi \"Netcam\" brands. This one was by far the easiest to setup and has the most features for the dollar that I have ever encountered. I set it up on a computer running Windows XP, MS Internet Explorer and a Netgear (N) router. Once camera was initially setup to work on a laptop, I also downloaded the iPad2 app and there was no setup at all for that...it just worked locally and remotely. Details: Like all wireless devices it gets a bit complicated if you want a secure Internet setup. In my opinion the manual in places, requires advanced home network knowledge. It has been translated from Chinese to English and some of the language (Sentence structure) is confusing due to that. If you are not afraid to wander off your default router settings, you will be able to setup a very secure internet camera to meet your very specific and secure needs. If use is limited to a local network its quite plug and play for basic needs and needs very minimal setup. Strengths: Being able to transmit your voice and listening while viewing remotely is a real plus. Microphone is pretty sensitive as well. Infrared seems a little dark but I am impressed with sensitivity and range. Weaknesses: Internal use only unless protected from the elements. Must have a router that handles  802.11 b/g at a minimum, 802.11 b/g is old protocol standard and has limited range and older security protocols, Need to understand how to setup a domain using one of the free service providers for remote(WAN)Internet use like dynds.org.

I bought two of these units and configured them in under 15 minutes. They are easy to configure, you simply plug in the camera with an ethernet cable then using the IP Camera tool you configure the wireless network settings. I configured the first one with no problems but the second unit would not even see my wireless network. This eliminates the possibility that I was doing something wrong. The second unit was defective, I contacted Foscam via email and they agreed to RMA the product. The very next day I had an emergency that I had to travel out of state because my mom was in the hospital. To make a long story short I was out of town for quite a while. When I returned I attempted to exchange the camera as agreed on by Foscam's rep. I was told that after 30 days I could not exchange it even though I was given an RMA number to do so. I just wanted to confirm that upon receipt of my defective unit I would be given credit to purchase another. They refused to answer my emails after 3 times of refusing to refund a defective unit. I have the RMA number but am afraid to ship the unit back in fear they won't credit me anyhow and I'll just be out the $89 I paid for the unit plus shipping on top of that. The cameras (well the ONE that works) are fair at a close distance, anything beyond 10 feet isn't too clear. Not much else to say other than how displeased I am with the lack of them holding up to exchanging the unit.
