{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wrong Camera!", "Author": "Richard DeMar \"mad scientist\"", "ReviewID": "R3VLGD165N0TT2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, wow... My first ever complaint review on Amazon! Not the first time I've ever had something negative to say, of course, but definitely the first time I've ever totally dissed a sale I got into. This is NOT the camera stated in the description. I ordered this under the clear indication that it was the KPC-DNR700NB. What arrived is a KPC-E700NUB. Sounds about the same, right? NO. It's a totally different experience. #1, NO SENS-UP control what-so-ever. Does it have the feature at all? I don't know, probably, because it does have really great low light performance, but the feature settings are NOT available in the OSD menu as they are with the KPC-DNR700, and that's half the reason I ordered. Having full control over the Sens-Up feature makes for a completely different camera with completely different abilities, far, far beyond this one. #2 is also a deal-breaker for me - any motion in the scene causes a huge amount of interlace distortion. It also runs a bit warmer than the KPC-DNR700, so that could also be a problem for me with my very specific applications in mind. Add these up, and it's a definite FAIL. What are you people doing up there on Amazon.com? With literally thousands and thousands of different camera models out there, and each having its own unique personality that can easily make or break a destination project, shouldn't you be making absolutely sure that the model numbers match between advertised description and product sent to the customer?Granted, this is the first time this has happened to me, so there IS that. Damned unfortunate that I now have to return an item I don't want anything to do with. >:-/Rick NR417", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1/3\" Sony Super HAD CCD \u2161, High-Resolution of 600 TVL\n3D DNR (3D Digital Noise Reduction), Digital WDR, Digital Day&Night;\nOSD with Built-In Joystick Controller, Privacy Mask\nCompact Size of 30mm(W) X 30mm(H), RS-485 Support\nDC 12V, KPC DNR700NHP1, P3, P4 AVAILABLE", "Name": "KT&C Color Miniature Camera 600 TVL, 3D DNR, SS-WDR, HSBLC, SENS UP, OSD, 12V DC, 30mm x 30mm", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TJZ6uyWsL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005QD97MI"}}
