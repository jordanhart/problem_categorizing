Conrad \"Cody  Conrad\"", "ReviewID": "R2IV283TQIHJWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I moved from Canon to Pentax About a year ago when I saw just about every piece of Cannon gear increase in cost by $1000. I was a 5d Mark II user,and could not fault the resolution and sharpness of the Camera, But It could not focus as was a the Rebel Series Cameras. I Had grown tired of Canon's Marketing strategies, So I sold all my lenses For more then I had purchased them for (Thank you Canon inflation). I also sold my 5d Mk II for a Very good used rate. I purchased the original Pentax K5, and very much liked a lot of things about the system.Better focusing, better metering, Much better color rendering. Canon always pushed the primary colors, and even the neutral setting has a Greenish hue. Pentax has a much better color representation, there are more hues, and rolling tones, also the shadows look much better. But the K5 was not as sharp as the Canon 5d MKII. Not the end of the world but still... Enter the K5 IIs This is a very different Camera entirely. It looks, and feels like a K5, But under the hood it is a detail Deva. Now I have the best of both systems. It's every bit as clear and detailed as the Canon Full Frames. Focus the eyes and you will see the depth and little details. Hairs are crisp. There is no need to sharpen the images in post like you might have done before. I shoot Raw plus Jpeg, but very rarely use the raw files.My settings(Highlight correction) on(Shadow Correction)  on(Expanded Sensitivity) on(Camera setting) Natural or BW There are three different Sharpening algorithms on this camera. Sharpen, Fine, and Extra (AKA Extra Fine.They are like selecting finer Radius amounts with higher amounts of output. I currently have mine set to Extra fine @ -2This sharpens down to the sub details without causing edgy halos.I adore this camera with the Sigma 85 1.4. At 3.5 Subjects are razor sharp with creamy butter filled backgrounds.So I am ecstatic about the images this camera body Produces. Do I miss shooting Full frame? Not really. I know in theory it should be a better image on a 35mm sensor. Bigger photocells,Better DOF, Blah,Blah, Blah. Here is my scientific Opinion. The movie industry uses The Red Epic Camera. It's sensor is 27.7 by 14.6 mm 5120 x 2700 pixel, 13.8 megapixel Bayer pattern 14 bit CMOS sensor. This would not seem very impressive in the still camera world, but I believe it proves a point that there is a lot more to consider for image quality then bigger sensors with more pixels. Sensors that produce the least amount of heat with on board Converters Can offer some of the best results. Then there is file handling,compression formats, and lots of other things we like to pretend to understand. The point is there are lots of things happening when you pull the shutter release, and when you compare the final product you should like what you are looking at. The Pentax K5 IIs looks like real life with a bit more punch, and I love it.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "GOODBYE CANON!!!", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R11X4G13R0U3AK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several professional cameras, more recently the Hasselblad H2 with P30 back and the Canon 5DMKII.  Hasselblad makes some of the best medium format cameras available.  I wish I could say Canon makes some of the best 35mm cameras but hey... the millions they spend each year on marketing and sales promotions doesn't equal the quality of image their camera's can produce.  I only bought the 5DII with 50mm 1.4 and 24mm TS-E II (allegedly some of Canon's \"BEST GLASS\") because other friends in the business prompted me to buy Canon.  \"It's great, you'll love it\", they told me.  They were wrong... DEAD wrong!  I hated Canon after owning a medium format camera with a Phase One back.  The Canon was lighter sure and much cheaper but I also learned why... it's designed and built to a much cheaper standard!Canon and Nikon (Pre-Nikon 800 / 800E owners that is) don't think there's anything wrong with their cameras because quite simply they don't know any different.  Harsh... not really, just the truth!  Until you've owned the best you don't know what GOOD/BETTER/BEST is.  I've heard so many \"experts\" and \"semi-pro's\" go on and on about Canon and Nikon and the proof is simply in the image quality and with Canon (all current models) and Nikon (except for the new 800/800E) quality simply isn't there.Then comes along a new Pentax camera, offering a model with no Anti-Aliasing filter.  Funny thing about that, medium format cameras... have no anti-aliasing filter... never have!  That's why MF is so much more crisp and vibrant.  It isn't just the extra sensor size and more megapixels (though believe me that makes a BIG difference).  The AA filter accounts for a HUGE part of the final image quality.  Nikon realized this and removed it from the 800E model and amazingly now.... Peter Lik is starting to shoot with an 800E... funny how people take notice of no AA filter.Pentax hit a home-run with the K-5 IIs.  This camera is my ultimate walk-around.  Does it replace my MF film equipment for landscapes... no, but then, few cameras truly can (Hasselblads H4D60 maybe, but not many).  What the IIs does is make things much harder on Canon and Nikon now because Pentax has mastered the art of squeezing every last ounce of dynamic range, sharpness and overall image quality out of this 16.1MP sensor.  Just check out DXO... the lab results don't lie.  This camera blows my old Canon 5DII TO THE WEEDS!!!!Just wait until Pentax unleashes the K-3 (said to be a FF 24MP follow-up to the K-5 II/IIs release of this year).  The K-3 is supposed to come in 2013 and I believe these two cameras combined will shake up the DSLR world in a way few cameras ever have!If you want an AWESOME DSLR, buy the K-5IIs and don't look back.  You'll be glad you did.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I finally found love", "Author": "Z. Wagner", "ReviewID": "R36GIYTQSKSUEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As silly as the title of this review may be, it's absolutely true.I've been through quite a few cameras:  Nikon D5000, D300s, D600.  Canon T2i, 5d II.  Panasonic G5, GX1.  Olympus EP-2, E-PL2, OM-D.  I've also owned various lenses for the above-mentioned cameras, many of them very nice.  But all of those cameras and lenses are now gone.  Selling and buying a new system can be very taxing, both financially and emotionally, and it was the same when I decided to try Pentax.  I remember the day I found this camera online; I just wasn't satisfied with my setup (at the time using both the D600 and OM-D) for whatever reason.  It's hard to explain.  I have gone through various states of enjoyment in the usage of many of the mentioned cameras, and the D600 and OM-D are both great in their own right (I really did enjoy my OM-D).  Absolutely.  But I just didn't LOVE them.So as I'm scouring the internet, searching for who knows what, I finally realize I've never given Pentax a chance.  So I click on over to the Pentax website and see the K-5 II.  Looks simplistic enough, but it's very small and looks as though it's got a good feel.  Then I see the K-5 IIs, sans AA filter, and immediately go: SOLD.  I then look at the lens line, and availability of lenses on Amazon and elsewhere and I'm not super impressed compared to other manufacturers (at least for the newer stuff).  But I decide, to heck with it.  I'm getting one.Best decision about photography gear I've made in my life.The first, and best, thing about this camera, and the thing I'll keep repeating is this: it just makes SENSE.  From the button layout to the way it feels in your hand to the size to the menus, the camera just makes SENSE.  I've had so many moments (more with certain manufacturers than others) that just made me go \"Why in the heck did they do it that way instead of this other way??\".  How many times have I asked that of this camera?  Zero.  It's so easy and quick to change the settings I use most it's almost obscene.  The best I can say about it is that it doesn't even feel like a camera.  It feels like a companion, or an extension of myself; one that is working with me, helping me to accomplish my goal, which is simply to make great images and absolutely enjoy doing it.  And I was able to have this experience right from jump.  I picked it up, put a lens on it, and started shooting, and the camera answered all my questions.  I don't think I looked at the manual one time.#2 is that this camera takes fantastic images.  The dynamic range is truly astounding, and I've taken shots that actually look like HDR shots without doing anything to them in post.  I've recovered detail from absolutely BLACK portions of a shot, where I was flabbergasted to find that there was actually something there.  It's amazing what you can pull out of these raw files, truly.Obviously the images are very detailed as well, which is an effect of the missing AA filter, and a welcome one.  In all the shots I've taken so far with it (I've yet to use it for a wedding, however), which is probably around 4k, I've yet to experience a hint of moire anywhere.  So if that's what's stopping you from getting this camera, don't let it.Don't believe me?  Go on over to dxomark and compare this camera's sensor to ALL other Canon sensors and see what you get.  Trust me, revelations are waiting.  Nikon has some of the best sensors in digital right now, and this camera is right there with them.#3 is that the AF system really isn't as bad as everyone makes it.  I'd say it's better than my 5d II was, but not by a lot.  I shot a hockey game in low light with a Sigma 50-150 2.8, and this camera did just fine.  Is it a speed demon?  Nope.  But never during that event did I find myself wishing for a faster AF.  And it will focus in EXTREMELY low light, which is a bonus if you ask me.#4 is the portability factor.  The size of this camera is fantastic.  Perfect.  Just verging on too small, but not jumping the line.  I've got fairly large hands (large glove size), and I have no trouble with holding or using the camera.  You can change pertinent settings with one hand if need be, and the camera is light enough that you can shoot with it all day and not worry about it.  Sure, my OM-D trumped it for portability, but certainly not for ergonomics!  This camera has the perfect combination of good ergonomics and portability.  For me it was nice to get a camera that was somewhere between the D600 and OM-D that I had.Negatives?  Well, the newer Pentax lenses have lots of SDM problems, and in general aren't the fastest focusing lenses on the planet.  That said, my Sigma lenses are great (the 50-150 focuses quite quickly).  And Pentax does have some pretty stellar prime lenses to choose from.  Their lenses are generally more contrasty than other manufacturers, which can make shots 'pop'.  So while there are some issues with the lens lineup, there are various ways to fill these problem areas.  And every manufacturer has issues somewhere in their lens lineup.Also, 1/180 flash sync could be much better.  This seems an odd thing to not address.I don't believe the camera supports UHS-1 speed cards either, which is another oddity that makes very little sense.However none of these negatives can overcome the sheer usability of the camera, and the absolutely fantastic level of enjoyment I get out of using it.  I can't imagine anyone who truly loves photography being disappointed with this camera.I'm certainly glad I took that pit stop on Pentax Imaging that day.(Update May 25, 2013)Well I've now been using this camera almost 4 months.  Not much has changed from my original assessment, if anything.  It remains an absolutely fabulous camera, with incredible image quality, that is just incredibly user friendly.  I can't recommend this camera highly enough.  While the lens situation can sometimes be odd (and Pentax just raised the price of a bunch of them, which sucks), Pentax still makes some of the best primes on the planet, and you can always get sdm motors repaired should they happen to fail on lenses like the 17-70mm f4.  Or just buy Sigma like I did.  Whatever lenses you choose to use, rest assured that the K-5 IIs will absolutely make the best of them.  Still highly, highly recommended.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "A surprisingly GREAT camera ... MUCH better than the specs!", "Author": "Jerry Jackson Jr.", "ReviewID": "R3KXCVD93AQXPI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a working photographer who has switched camera systems so many times that now I just accept the fact that I use a variety of camera brands. I don't get hung up on the brand name of my gear ... I just want my gear to work and deliver the results I want to produce.I have to say I've been completely blown away by the Pentax K-5 IIs.On paper the K-5 IIs looks like a fairly average professional DSLR with an APS-C image sensor. Looks, however, are very deceiving in this case. For starters, the K-5 IIs has an extremely rugged body made of magnesium alloy and fully weather sealed. When combined with a weather-sealed lens you can cover this camera with mud or sand and then just rinse it off with some tap water in your kitchen sink! I've owned Canon and Nikon DSLRs with equally impressive build quality but they are MUCH larger, heavier and more expensive. The K-5 IIs gives you professional build quality without useless weight and bulk.Additionally, the AF system is able to correctly focus even in almost complete darkness WITHOUT the aid of an annoying AF-assist flashlight!!! Any wedding or event photographer knows the frustration of trying to focus in the dark and we know the added frustration that comes when our subjects get the \"deer in the headlights\" look from an AF-assist light. Having a camera that can focus in the dark without the trance-inducing AF-assist light is a good thing. The K-5 IIs does have an AF-assist light, but it rarely needs it and you can disable it in the menu so it never turns on and you probably won't have problems focusing.I almost dismissed the K-5 IIs out of hand because of the fact it \"only\" has a 16 megapixel image sensor, but I'm glad I took another look. Sure, cameras with 22, 24, 36, or more megapixels sound better, but upon closer examination those higher-megapixel cameras aren't really rendering much more detail (if any) and the limited increase in detail (if any) comes at the expense of higher ISO noise (at least with higher megapixel APS-C cameras) and much larger file sizes (meaning your memory card fills up faster or your computer slows down when editing the files later. After looking closely at images from the K-5 IIs and two DSLRs with full-frame sensors (which are MUCH more expensive) I can't see a significant advantage in terms of detail, color or ISO performance (except at extreme ISOs above 3200) to the images from the full-frame cameras.These comments are from someone who OWNS and USES full-frame cameras and not a Pentax fan who is trying to justify spending less on a DSLR with an APS-C sensor.Part of the secret to the success of the K-5 IIs is the fact that Pentax has perfected the use of this 16-megapixel APS-C sensor rather than jumping immediately to a new sensor. Another reason for the extreme image detail from this camera is the lack of an AA filter on the sensor. An AA filter is used on most cameras to avoid moire (a color banding effect that can occur in fine details with complex patterns). AA filters prevent moire but in so doing they introduce a blurring effect to fine details. If you remove the AA filter you get no blur but you \"might\" get moire which you'll either have to live with or remove later using Photoshop, Lightroom, or another image editing program.This is why I love the K-5 IIs: in the \"rare\" event that I see annoying moire in an image I can remove it using software that doesn't blur details. Another camera with an AA filter is less likely to record moire in the first place, but there is no way to bring back the fine details that were blurred out at the time the image was recorded. I'd rather remove annoying moire from time to time and record ALL the details rather than blur out detail just so I don't have to worry as much about moire.I was also completely taken by surprise when I noticed that the JPEGs coming straight out of the K-5 IIs (I shoot in RAW+JPEG) have roughly as much detail as the processed RAW image files coming from the Canon 5D mkIII and the Nikon D600 that I've used. That little surprise is HUGE. What that means is that I don't have to process RAW just to get the fine detail that I want. I only have to process RAW files from the K-5 IIs if I completely messed up white balance or need more exposure latitude in highlights or shadows. If you're a working photographer (or just someone shooting for fun) then you know that time is valuable ... and if you can get away with JPEGs rather than needing to tweak RAW files and then convert those RAW files to JPEG that's a HUGE advantage.Bottom line, the K-5 IIs is an amazing camera that is worth more than the selling price and is MUCH better than the specs suggest at first glance.Highly recommended.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "More than a worthwhile upgrade", "Author": "Elixer", "ReviewID": "R2V6876YAS7TGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from an advanced 'point and shoot' camera to the Pentax K5 in mid 2012. Initially, i worked the kit lenses and not long after purchased the Pentax 70mm prime. I was very impressed with the image quality. The thing is, later that year(2012), Pentax announced the K5ii and the K5iis. At that point in my life in mid 2012, i predominantly did work in the auto-sport arena and i was very enthusiastic(still is) about that type of photography. I had however moved onto Weddings by the end of 2012.I ordered my K5iis early January 2013, the Tamron 70-200, Pentax 40mm prime and i was ready for business(Tamron 17-50 on the way). My first few shots with the K5iis looked quite nicely on the new gap-less screen but, i was blown away with the sharpness i saw after i viewed those very photos on my computer! I have been using this camera mainly with my Tamron 70-200 and the sharpness is remarkable. I believe any user coming from a K5 will also appreciate the fact that the ISO performance is noticeably better along with quicker low light focusing.Basically, what Pentax claims you get with this camera, i can confirm is true. In the end, we want a camera that's dependable, sharp, quick enough, easy to manipulate and a joy to handle............the K5iis is all that and more. Now, its not perfect because i have had few occasions where moire was present but, subtle and corrected in my post processing 90% of the times. The K5iis promises incredible results that will impress ANY client you have or will have. Any competitors you have i believe will now have to try harder to be you OR, better you!!", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most excellent stills DSLR, with some video added as after-thought", "Author": "Gal", "ReviewID": "R2QO3KBT2JX8SO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My previous, and first, DSLR was the very good K20D. Sturdy, ergonomical, but with mediocare autofucos and handling low light and high contrast situations. And of course, no video.Before going on a big family vacation to western Canada, including a week on the Rockies, I have decided an upgrade was in order. After considering various alternatives, including mirrorless systems, the K-5IIs remained on the top list, maily due to the fact that I am mostly a stills photographer.Overall the K-5IIs was used to take some 1000 shots before the trip and about 2500 during it. The K20D was taken along as a backup. was completely unused and is slated to be sold soon.The K-5IIs has indeed met all my expectations as an upgrade to my older DSLR --* Superior ergonomics with very few caveats. Very small (took some time to get used to) and very solid. Direct access to almost all the important functions. Button on the PASM is a bit annoying. Function button on front got accidently pressed from time to time. LCD is industry standard, removal of airgap have helped a bit in usability under bright sunlight. K20D was very good ergonomically, K-5IIs is overall better.* Focus is amazing, very fast, very accurate even in very dark situations. AF.S mode is as good or even better than on Canon 7D, AF.C is of less use to me, but functioned to my almost comlete satisfaction.* Body is very robust. I miss the little handle opened SD card cover of the K20D, but beside that the K5IIs feels like it predecessor - built like a tank. Got realy wet in a rain during the trip - no problem. Battery would last 600-800 shots, depending on your usage profile.* Image quality - AMAZING. Very high contrast in the rockies came out amazing. In ISO=80 the dynamic range is outstanding, who needs HDR? ZERO noise, even in the deepest shadows in ISO=80 and almost no noise up to 400 and even 800. Results up to 6400 are good and are still acceptable at 12800 and in a pinch at 25600.Colors? A bit dull by default, but they are all in the RAW file, a few seconds with the sliders and you get the magical colors of the Fujis and more if that is your wish.And oh, sharpness. The results are sharp to the point your eyes would bleed. Get a decent lens (mine is a Sigma 17-50/2.8), shoot at f=5.6 and the lowest ISO possible and enjoy a most vivid picture overall and details down to the pixel level.Important note - this camera cries for a sharp lens, so if you still haven't one and this camera is on your list, consider expanding your equipment budget. Also - in order to fully enjoy its outstanding sensor, better shoot RAW.* Liveview and Video - Liveview improved over the K20D and is much more usable, but this camera was designed to be shot from its bright, 100% optical viewfinder.Video is of excellent quality, but for such a camera, lack of manual control is unacceptable. MJPEG format gives you crystal clear clips, but eats up memory cards like crazy. Microphone is monoaural and of acceptable quality, a stereo mic input is available, as well as an HDMI for external display.So - 5 stars as a stills camera, 4.5 stars if you also want video from time to time.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Detail Monster or This is the camera I've been waiting for!!", "Author": "Tandy J.

I am not a professional but done some research since I had bought my first DSLR and figured it was time to jumped off the Fanon Wagon. I have sold a few of my canon accessories here on amazon after going back and forth between a Mark II and the Pentax K-IIs as my upgrade options; since the price is now almost the same.

One, the camera is weather proof and magnesium alloy body.  Second, I like that the \"shake reduction\" is in camera which might be an advantage when buying lenses.  Pentax lens should be cheaper and if not, they do go on sale plenty at B&H; Photo. The buttons for this camera is also laid out nicely, changing shutter/ISO/Aperture with ease. It is packed with features, from built in filters/electronic leveling/photo editing etc. I also like the size of this camera, it is a smaller DSLR but hefty and solid.

The vendor, a NJ outfit, called me almost immediately when I complained the packing was inadequate and not sealed, although the camera appeared undamaged. I must say after a day of shooting both stills and video, it is easily the best of them all with the K5 being the runner up, and the K-01 coming in 3rd. Still, each camera has its niche and does very well in it.This is my 1st camera without an AA filter. Yes, I *DID* notice moire. The band's speakers had a honeycomb regular appearance that brought moire with it in the video. But the excellent color rendition and picture quality made the moire trivial. Perhaps it would have been more objectionable if it had been in the textile of runway models. So don't use the K5-iis for that. But for average scenes, it can't be beat if it has a good lens on the body. The AF *is* quicker than the K5. This body brings out details in the shadows even without any HDR bracketing. The internal mic is fine for most purposes. 99% of people will love this camera with all the quality classic and newer lenses available for it. The Street price has come down to just over $1,000 for it--a steal driven by all the hype about full frame sensors and the increased size of sensors showing up on P&S; cameras.I'd like a FF digital body & sensor myself, but that's mostly ego talking. This body does better than many pricier FF bodies. It does lack focus peaking and, more importantly, AF in video mode, but in bright daylight, I found the depth of focus adequate to compensate except for subjects 4' away or closer.  I was using a Tamron 2.8 28-75mm zoom lens for a street fair which included a klezmer band and it did quite well. I'd recommend this camera body and its lens selections to those who want an unsurpassed solidly built photography tool with almost all the bells & whistles without the overpriced hype and advertising overhead.There are better bodies for sports photo professionals, but this can produce respectable shots even there for patient amateurs with the right flash gear.  I feel it's greatest strength is in most news gathering venues. The Nikon Coolpix P7700 has better low light capability, but this body and the appropriate lens blows the P7700 away when it comes to color rendition and IQ. Also, the P7700 has considerable shutter/refresh lag which this does not. Like motorcycles, each camera has its own personality and strengths. One size does not fit all. It *is* easy to go through batteries in all the excitement, so purchase 2-3 extras for quick reloading on a shoot. I prefer  Sandisk (U1) (i.e. class 10+) 32GB SDHC memory cards...at least 2 or 3 for this body because video can eat up memory quickly. Review ratings for this model are consistently high. You won't ever regret owning one.The vendor (Big Value, Inc.) who sold me this was extremely cordial, helpful, and expressed a firm desire to have satisfied customers. The vendor's price was very competitive. I'd buy this camera from that vendor (Big Value, Inc. in NJ) again. The gratuity (32GB class 10 Patriox LX SDHC memory card) arrived insanely well packaged, perhaps as a statement the vendor would henceforth package the K5-iis body more prudently when shipping.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Step Up", "Author": "Ed Bob", "ReviewID": "R21XHG8UPT4V3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a K20D and read about the K-5 iis and decided to step up( I have been completely satisfied with the K-20D.

I still own the istD, K10, K20D and K-7.  Now I have added the K-5IIs. I choose the S model of the K-5II for the improved sharpness with the removal of the anti aliasing filter. I have shot about 500 frames with the IIs since receiving Xmas day and it has shown to be the sharpest imagery I have ever taken.  My lenses are all the same (a mix of Pentax and Tamron).  BTW,  I shot from f2.8 up to F11 and intentionally increased sharpness to drive moire or other effects.  I have not seen anything that looks like an oddity.  If your not a semi-pro or higher you may want to stay with the K-5II but if you are experienced I would not hesitate to go with  S model.  Other notes,  I skipped the 1st Gen K-5 but compared to the K-7 the ISO performance of the K-5IIs is phenomenal, Very pleased with the auto noise reduction through the ISO range. Image noise at ISO 5000 on the K-5IIs is as good as ISO 800 in the K-7.  ISO 51,200 is something to experiment with and seems best in just B&W; mode.  Other items that are useful.  If shooting in JPEG your last frame remains convertable back to RAW with a press of the AE-L button.  Very handy.  Also the + - extended bracketing for white balance or sharpness, contrast etc is an awesome tool either alone, or when combined with exposure bracketing will give you net 9 images to work with for a 3 shot  -,0,+ .X EV.  Focusing speed is vastly improved and in continuous focus mode you can prioritize  whether you want the frames per second or focus accuracy.  I tracked my son playing singles tennis with the FPS priority and still had crisp shots.  I believe Pentax has been very thoughtful in keeping strong consistency in the user interface and in keeping the same form factor from K-7, K-5 to K-5IIS. the camera is a delight to hold, work with and will travel well.  I am exceptionally pleased with this purchase, because 1300 dollars is still a big expenditure when you have a family. I am on the pentax photogallery as artist search \"buh\" first initial \"c\".  None of my Pentax cameras have ever failed or broken and I shot about 20,000 images this year alone.

Garrard", "ReviewID": "RNCRQKGB3MZOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Differences compared to the K5 (to which I gave a DSLR of the Decade award on my blog photographic hyphen central dot blogspot dot com) is a short list: Gapless LCD screen (better viewing w/glass cover!), Safox X af system (improved), and lack of an Anti Aliasing filter. A few tweaks on the firmware that aren't really advertised are also part of the package.The K5 was so good it was hard to improve upon, that is what the K3 is for :).That said, the short list of improvements are three areas the K5IIs addresses that are all welcomed by myself and what looks to be like just about everyone that has reviewed this camera here on Amazon. Since the K5IIs is weather sealed at a much higher level that other cameras in its class, having a flip and twist LCD would only open up places in the camera to intrusive weather elements- so Pentax filled the gap between the screen and protective plastic cover so internal reflections and/or debris were eliminated. Better viewing and no more debris showing up inside the screen that you can't remove. That was a smart decision.Removing the AA filter is a great way to improve fine detail in comparative 16mp sensor cameras, effectively making this camera compare more to 24mp in fine detail output without having to deal with storing those file sizes. Moire isn't easy to remove so that is the downside of it but, I find shooting in real life this isn't as much of an issue at all as it is made out to be.With the auto focus, its much more sensitive than the K5 was in lower light levels, and speed of AF is only slightly better with good light. That's ok because the AF system on the K5, for the camera you are getting, was already pretty darn good- Pentax just needs faster focusing SDM lenses to help the matter. The screw driven lenses are quick enough but are louder- so be prepared for that. The upside- all pentax K mount lenses fit and work on the K5IIs, unlike other manufacturers. It's a huge advantage to those with K mount glass, huge.Moving on from the differences, the K5IIs is a literal toolbox of features for active photographers. If it were a swiss army knife, it would be about 3 feet wide compared to other cameras. There is just so much it CAN do, I cannot mention the entire list here on a review like this. Here is the pro list from my K5 review I completed on my blog Oct 2011 which many apply to the K5IIs, along with the above improvements I outlined already:  Customization Galore  Huge ISO range 80-51,200 (and a true 80!)  Highest  Image Quality of any APS-C DSLR (as of writing)  Images Print Excellent Up to ISO 16,000, Useful Beyond to ISO 51,200  Excellent Extreme Weather/Environment DSLR  A Enthusiasts Wish-List Come True  Generally Fast, Accurate, and Tenacious Low Light Auto Focusing  SHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhh..... It's Ultra Quiet (see con list)  Small form factor, well balanced weight  Excellent Large, Comfortable, Secure grip (one handed shooting all day long)  Handling is excellent for such a small DSLR  Best Dust Removal/Prevention System of Any DSLR  100% Accurate, Large, Bright Optical Viewfinder  Big LCD Screen (Color/Brightness Customizable)  Dual Customizable Control Dials  Stellar Price/Feature Ratio  Fast Frame Rate (6.9 fps Tested, 7fps claimed)  Strap Lugs Do Not Interfere With Handling (do not press against pressure points on hand)  Excellent Live View Options (Fast Contrast Detect AF w/firmware update)  Several Firmware Updates Enhance Feature Set/Support User  Excellent Choice For Military/Coast Guard/Government Service Journalists  User Choice for Noise Reduction On Jpegs  Automatic Lens Distortion Correction (for more modern Pentax Lenses)  Autofocus Fine Tuning (up to 20 lenses)  Embedded Custom Copyright Information Option  4 Customizable Buttons/Dials  Tilt/Axis Digital Level (tilt level even in the viewfinder!)

Right now, the K5IIs remains the best bang for the buck in DSLR territory on the market, hands down. It's highly recommended, and a very mature and progressive product that has been tweaked since the introduction of the K7 back in May of 2009 (still has the same form factor mostly to the K7).There are lots of lens options within Pentax and with Tamron and Sigma too. If you don't need the zillion choices Canon and Nikon give you with their lens lineup, you'll likely be a lot happier with a Pentax like the K5IIs.

Removing the AA filter made for a significant upgrade from the K5. Finally, crisp sharp images and more accurate colors. The newer screen on the back is also much brighter, more colorful and easier to see in the daylight. I chose this over the newer K3 because the price was unbeatable. Also, the K3 didn't appear to make quite as good images. Being a new design, with a new sensor, there may be issues, much like the K5 had.The only real advantage of the K3, image quality wise, is the increased number of pixels, which allow for greater enlargements. But, I can make 8X10's that show no signs of pixelation, and probably double that size if I wished with my k5IIs. If you purchase either one of these cameras, prepare to buy some better lenses, because all the flaws will appear in your images using cheap zoom and kit lenses. One of the great advantages of this camera is the fact you can use a multitude of older lenses, and still have the shake reduction feature. Pentax is the only one to offer in-camera shake reduction.

I was seriously considering a K-3 but the price for a K-5IIs was too good to pass up. Even though it is still a 16 MP camera, removing the AA filter has significantly increased the sharpness, resolution and the general overall image quality. Other improvements such as extreme low light AF and AF consistency have also made it a better experience. Lenses that used to require quite a bit of AF-FA (such as Tamron 17-50) no longer need any. Since it replaced a nearly identical but older K-5, there is no learning curve at all.Jan 18 2014 updateI have been using the new K-5 IIs for about 2 weeks. I am truly amazed by the clarity and sharpness compared to the K-5. AF is significantly improved over the K-5. It does not perform just like a 16MP camera, it is definitely a step jump that I was not expecting.

However, if you're kinda new to this and seriously wanting to invest in a nice camera for the long haul, en I can offer you some advice.I was looking for an entry  level to mid-range DSLR.  I researched for a two months before my purchase. I chatted with different types of photographers as well as a couple of specialists on Adorama.  I feel like I covered my bases!The cameras I was considering:  Pentax K-50, Pentax K-30, Pentax K5ii, Canon T3i, T4i, Canon 60D, NikonD3200 & D5200.What I will use it for:  Various shots while hiking, landscapes and some portraitsWhat made me consider Pentax in the first place?  The toughness of the body and the weather sealing advantage.  I spend lots of time hiking and outdoors; It would be nice to have a camera I don't have to stow away when the weather isn't perfect.  Of course, you have to invest in the Pentax weather resistant lens to have the full effect.Why Canon?  My 35mm was a Canon as well as my little Powershot point and shoot camera.  They have a huge selection of lenses and a great reputation.All of the reviews I read comparing the Canon T3i and the Pentax K-50, had the Pentax winning out every time, especially in image quality.  They both had categories in which they beat the other, but overall the K-50 pulled ahead in first.  Both of the specialist I spoke with at Adorama are photographers.  They both admitted Pentax couldn't  be beaten in image quality for the type of camera I was considering. Also, I was told their lens build is exceptional quality.  One specialist just advised me I wouldn't have the lens selection like Canon.  This isn't a concern for me.  I don't see me acruing a massive selection of lenses or that I will ever have the need to do so.  Plus, with great third parties out there now like Sigma and Tamron, this just isn't an issue in my eyes.  So after I read all of the positive reviews comparing Pentax to these other powerhouses, and considering the weather sealing properties, it tipped the scales for me.I went with the pentax K-5iis over the 50 because it is a higher quality camera.  Also, once I added up the cost of the two cameras with the lenses that I wanted, there was just a $200 price difference.  I thought that was worth going with the \"better\" camera.Out of the box:  very sturdy and solid, substancial battery grip & perfect layout of dials and buttons.  This camera fits my hands perfectly.  I was afraid it would be too big since I have somewhat small hands but it was perfect.  The one thing I love the most is that the layout of the camera just makes sense!  It's just like everything is where it needs to be & you have no thought of, \"why is that there?\".  Image quality with my 50mm f1.4 is crisp and clear.  The viewing screen is very bright and nice size.  I just wish it was moveable but that's not that big of a deal for me.  I also would like to have an extra card slot but it's fine with just one.I will add more to my review after the holidays when I will be giving it lots of use.  Please feel free to ask any questions!

I thought they were just great.  And they were.  But they were a product of their time.  Enter the digital age and the D1, the D50, D70S and the D200.  They were good also and you could see your pictures right away, there was no waiting.  Then something happened.  I began to look around and notice other camera brands.  I took a chance on Pentax and never looked back.  Not only were the Pentax cameras every bit as good as Nikon or Canon, but they had features that the others lacked.I bought the K5.  It was built like a tank, very solid, weather proof and comfortable to hold in the hands.  The K511s is even better.  Not only does it retain all those good features of the K5, but with the anti-alliasing filter, the images are even sharper.  The auto focus seems to be quicker, especially in low light.  The controls are well placed and intuitive.  The menus are easy to understand and navigate.  I especially like the digital filters, which remain unchanged from the K5.  Both they and the cropping tool are much better than Nikon (D 7000)or Canon (60 D).But the real test of any camera is how well you can take pictures with it and just how good are they compared to what you have been taking.  With me, there is just no comparison.  Maybe if I was a pro things would be different, but I'm not.  I take amateur pictures just like most other people.  I find that my photos (I never use photo shop) come out of my camera in exactly the condition I desire.  I use the filters and croping tool to customize my photos to my satisfaction.Pentax makes excellent lenses, however, I have been using Sigma and Tamron lenses.  They operate on the K511s quite nicely.  The Sigma 17-70 2.8 is an upgrade to the 18-55 kit lens that comes with the camera.All in all, the Pentax K5lls is a very wonderful camera and it is among the very best in the world.  Now that I have both the K5 and the KllS, I can go out in the field with two lenses and will not need to change lenses often.

Through time I have used and still have a Pentax K1000, Canon AE-Program, and I recently got a Nikon F100, which I absolutely love. In fact, I sold my Nikon D80 earlier this year to get back into film with the F100.As I realized that I needed to have a digital SLR camera as well, I started researching the Nikon D7000 and came across the Pentax K5 IIs. As I have a couple of lenses from the K1000 I got interested as Pentax glass is very good. As I was used to Nikon and really liked it, I decided to buy both the D7100 and K5 IIs (both filter-less) and took pictures for over a week with both. The D7100 is an excellent camera and my wife and I really liked it, but the K5 IIs just worked better for us. I read the manual and was able to manage all the features/menus more easily than with Nikon. The D70 and D80 I used to have were packed with useful features for the time, but the reality is that to use many of them I needed to get deep into menus, which in practice I almost never did. With Pentax, I am really using many features, which I am enjoying greatly, and I can see the results in the pictures I take.I bought the K5 IIs at the end of Feb-14 and waited to write this review until the end of April, after we went East for spring break. We are positively impressed with the pictures we took. My wife took a picture of the cables at the Brooklyn bridge in NY with no visible moire, nor in any other picture. That same night I took a few beautiful pictures of the Chrysler building at around 8pm, with lights on and a blue sky on the back, at ISO 2000, hand held, of course with no flash, very nice. For the most part we used the Pentax 18-135mm WR lens. We did not do video at all so cannot comment on that, and will probably seldom use that feature.The only problem we found was with how reds/pinks/purples sometimes appear in the pictures. I have read a little about it and it seems that digital SLRs have some issues in general with reds, but I need to do more research on it.

It all about lenses and photographers skill and time, a newer camera always appeals to the geek in me but unless you really need it it often becomes a let down (perhaps prompting you to try a different brand or camera body).  All that being said I am skeptical whether the new K3 is worth the money; it's review is as great sounding as K5iis that I purchased less than a year ago.  Pentax and other camera producers;  please give us consumers a worthwhile upgrade for our hard earned money.  All I see are small incremental features in these body changes for big $.  There are many less expensive Point and shoot cameras now available with wi-fi and a plethora of proven high tech features.  Why release all the new high end model \"upgrades\" without any substantial improvements or wi-fi for instance? This marketing criticism is not just directed at Pentax.  Nikon and Canon also whip out new models with little regard for adding consumer value and it appears they are only geared at padding their wallets thru product obsolescence.  My advise is to resist the newest camera and purchase the previous model (like this k-5 iis) at significant discounts vs last year and they are throwing in other goodies for free.  Its now selling for 60% of last years price. I feel like I've been ripped off.

Looks and feels very well made and ready for action. I picked this model and the Pentax WR lens as I am going to use the camera on my trip to Europe and I wanted a rugged and weather resistant camera and lens. However, I was surprised that it did not come with a printed manual. It had a cd with the package with no instructions. Not only no printed manual but not even a quick start guide. I guess Pentax feels if you buy this type of camera, you are already an advanced photographer and don't need a manual. Even the cd had no instructions regarding a manual. I had to Google for a manual and I found the manual download on a Pentax users Forum. I downloaded it and printed it out. I then checked Ebay and found some printed manuals for the Pentax K5. The sellers wanted $14.00 but I thought it would be cheaper to print out the download.To make the camera even more rugged I purchased the battery grip and a glass screen for the camera's monitor. The lens I ordered came with a UV lens filter already. I may even buy a screen for the lcd on top of the camera. I want to make the camera as weather and scratch resistant as possible. This is the main reason I did not go with Canon or Nikon. I will update this review after my trip next month. I bought everything through Amazon as they have the best price and service.
