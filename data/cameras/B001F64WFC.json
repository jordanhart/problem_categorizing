The price is certainly right and it works as advertised.I did hook up the video out to my PC and was not pleased with the quality of the video as displayed there.  However, it might be that the problem resides in the device that goes between the two.  I'm still working on that problem.

I am installing this is a Home System Cabinet so the space is limited. This resulted in requiring another Power Strip.Total additional cost of $60.00.3) After finally getting it connected, it failed to work. Only one Camera would come on regardless of the settings. After fooling with it for hours I went out and purchased a new 19-inch monitor, another $190.00 wasted.4) So spending another 90 minutes and still only one Camera would display no matter what the setting, I returned this piece of crap.==> Do NOT purchase one of these. I cannot say enough BAD things about this product.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$279.45", "Features": "Four camera outputs can be combined into one video signal for simultaneous display and recording\nSelectable picture in picture modes, quad split mode, full screen mode, PIP screen mode, dual split mode, auto sequence mode\nCamera title, time and date display for easy identification, 4 channel BNC input and 3 video BNC outputs\nFreeze picture capability for each camera, audible notification of motion detected\nPlug and play, very simple to install, comes with 12V power supply, free remote controller", "Name": "VideoSecu 4 Channel CCTV Surveillance Security Camera Color Video Quad Processor Splitter Real Time with Remote Controller C43", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-PreQQIL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001F64WFC"}}
