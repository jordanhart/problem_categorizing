{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not the US compatible model", "Author": "Michael Leonard", "ReviewID": "R57HGVZP9UNM1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would love to give this purchase a 5 star rating. It is a great camera and the bundled package offers a ton of great stuff. I paid $10 more for this package than just purchasing the camera alone and you get $100-$200 worth of extras. The extra battery alone is a great deal. HOWEVER, and this is a MAJOR however. I purchased this camera not only to take pictures with and replace my older Sony a100 but also to shoot video with it. I purchased it on the Amazon US store. The camera in the kit is the EUROPEAN model and does not shoot video in US standards. In the US we have 60i/p TV sets as the standard. This camera can only shoot in 50i which is the standard for European and other countries. So, if you shoot video with it you can't watch. It is totally unsatisfactory for a company to sell a camera in the US that isn't compatible with US standards. I contacted Amazon and all they could do was have me send everything back. They could not guarantee if I ordered the package again that I would get the US model of the camera. They said Web Offers just send Amazon their inventory and Amazon sells what they receive. Now besides several hours of wasted time playing with the kit, finding out it was the wrong version of the camera, contacting Amazon to get it sent back, and packaging everything back up to ship back; I now have to settle with just buying the camera without the awesome package if I want to get the compatible US model. I feel like my time has been totally wasted. Web Offers should have told Amazon they were selling a non-US model of the camera and the description of the camera on the website should have described to shoppers it was the non-US model.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great package!", "Author": "Melissa Frier", "ReviewID": "R1EWRDW4QATX3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd like to start by saying I am not a professional photographer; photography is just a hobby for me.  But this was my first purchase of A DSLR and I couldn't be happier.  The pictures are crisp and clear, and so far the extra lenses, battery, and such have come in very handy. The performance of this camera has outdone anything I expected, and my friends have been very jealous!  I am still learning how to use this camera, but it comes with a complete manual that has been really useful.  I greatly recommend this package deal to anyone wanting a good DSLR.  I know there are much fancier ones out there that would be a better choice if you are a professional, but this suits my needs well.  And I will definitely look for this same seller when I decide to purchase more items for this camera.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera and package", "Author": "Thomas Tackett", "ReviewID": "R2UD8BZABQUJZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is great! The package gives you some nice quality items and some very cheap stuff, but considering the included items are basically free since the package is the same price as other retailers charge for only the camera you really can't complain. It allowed me to get gear I can use as an amateur without spending an insane amount of money on everything separately. Highly recommended!", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pros and cons about the items.", "Author": "pablo", "ReviewID": "R12XXT666IZL76", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is excellent, perfect, too much camera for the price, the only thing i didn't like about the package was the tripod and the memory card wallet, also, the Macro/Wide angle and the 2X telephoto converters have to use a mounting ring because they are for 58mm lenses, the mounting ring came in the package, everything else was excellent, the 3 filters have a really nice case and the tripod has it own bag, just like the filters. really liked it, would buy it again and recommend it to a friend, or anyone looking for a good camera for the price.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Definitely a good buy!", "Author": "joshua snow", "ReviewID": "R1VKB5RD01FV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use!

There were so many extras in the kit that I couldn't believe my fortune in deciding to purchase this camera. However, it is a European model, thus some of the features are differenct and for some reason, not as responsive as I hoped it would be. I sometimes miss photos because of this and am disappointed in that because I do much candid photography and when the moment is gone, it's gone.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great deal for the money.", "Author": "Catherine Baschmann", "ReviewID": "R24Z01EYST0DX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is very easy to use and takes extremely nice and clear pictures. I am just learning how to use all of it's features. You can also use Minolta lenses if you had a Minolta in the past. I'm really finding this camera easy to use in auto and in manual.
