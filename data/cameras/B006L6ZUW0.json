We loved it. I was very happy to find the newer version C135. I ordered 2. So far, we have only used one but it is great! I love the picture and video quality. I have not tried them underwater yet but I will be doing that soon. I recently bought a Nikkon waterproof camera and I was completely disgusted with the picture quality. I returned it in like 3 days. I am very picky and hard to please so it says a lot that I am so happy with this camera. Unlike the Nikkon, with this camera I can control the flash with ON, OFF, and AUTO settings with the touch of a button. Also, I can change settings (underwater, etc) with the touch of a button. I don't have to acces a menu which makes using the camera quicker and easier. Always a plus!", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kodak C135- worked great!", "Author": "Judith J. Gossett", "ReviewID": "RW4JMDK6DKVQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had my worries since Kodak has quit making cameras, but have to say that I couldn't be happier with the purchase! Paid roughly $75!Shot pics and video for 6 straight days in Kauai and our family took video and pics in the pool on three occasions as well.There seem to be two different review links on Amazon; one with 700+ reviews, which seems to be lumped with the older C123 model, and then this review batch with only a dozen or so. Looking at the reviews in the larger group, I was apprehensive about fatal failures listed of water leaking into the battery compartment, so when I got the camera I checked out the compartment doors.There is an outer door and an inner door. The inner door hinges shut, then you have to slide it a bit to ensure it is fully closed. Just speculating, but it may be the case that the leaks listed on reviews are due to the inner door not being properly slid shut?Picture and video quality were fantastic. Was even able to adjust resolution underwater rather easily. To be honest, I should have studied the functional menu a bit more before taking it in the water, but it was fairly intuitional.Was pleasantly surprised at how long the battery life was on the camera. Could get a pair of Duracell's to last through two days of snorkeling (3 sessions per day, probably 200 pics and a couple dozen videos of 1 minute or less each). Read other reviews where this was not the case, but this is an honest assessment.At the most I only dove to a depth of 6 feet or so (2 meters max). Water temp was 78 degrees everyday. Had no issues with the lens fogging up as others did in the C123/C135 review column (700+ reviews).I am very happy to have snagged one of these cameras while they were still available for this trip!!

(Use good Enhancing software)", "Author": "AmazonAaron", "ReviewID": "R7Y37CYH7XMAE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera specifically for above- and underwater use on a snorkeling trip, and it did an amazing job.  the camera was very easy to use, again whether above or underwater.  I love the separate video button, especialy when snorkeling giving you one-click access to video.My only complaint regarding use of the camera was that I had to keep putting it back into H2O mode while snorkeling; when the camera went to sleep it reset itself to Auto.The pictures I took underwater looked rather green on the screen and when first uploaded to a computer, but once I used some editing software and just pressed the \"Auto Enhance\" button, the underwater pictures POPPED with gorgeous color the camera had captured!  The Enhancing also helped the above-water pictures have brighter and truer colors (blue and greens).  (This camera did not come with software; I was using some software that came with my kids Coleman cameras.)Warning: this camera sinks!  So get a floating wrist strap to go with it. (intersetingly the Coleman cameras I got the kids floated by themselves, but weren't overall as nice as this one.)The camera did suck down batteries; i put in three new sets of AAs over 5 days of intermittent use.  The camera would say it had half a battery left, but then it would turn itself off when I tried to take a picture, so be sure they are full before you set out for the day to avoid getting disappointed.I had NO issues with water leakage.  There are two doors protecting the batteries and SD card, and I could possibly see that if you only closed the outer one without seating the inner one first you could suffer leakage, but properly closing both doors in turn seemed to create a tight seal.  My only question is how long that tight seal will hold up over months or years of use...that has yet to be determined.Finally this camera does not come with an SD card.  This seems to be standard practice now, although they don't mention that in the specs, so I thought i'd point it out.  It takes a full-sized card, not micro.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "very disappointed", "Author": "wadep", "ReviewID": "R11KTE9MYBCXP6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this camera before we went to Cancun, and on our first day there we had taken over 100 pics and vids and when we were looking at the pics the camera deleted all of them. Very upsetting but at least it was the first day and not the last. Then a few days later the lens fogged up a number of times and we never took the camera below 6 inches worth of water.

Used on two different cruises and worked well both times. The nice surprise is how well pictures taken on auto setting are.  It is a handy little camera.  It has a few scene settings which worked well.  I also used it to take indoor shots at shows at Disney World with the flash turned off and got really great pictures.Make sure you follow the directions after replacing batteries and/or memory card. There is a small orange door that covers the batteries and memory card. Close that door first then the outer door of the camera itself.  This is two separate steps which are  necessary to make sure the waterproof feature works.Also used the video feature which is again a pleasant surprise. No issues at all. The zoom does get a bit grainy if you are really far away.Was very pleased with my pictures, the overall features (i.e.: auto setting, waterproof feature, choice of scene settings, video, and zoom) I also liked the size of the camera..

I have not yet used it under water and will update this review after I have done that in a month or so.  I am using it with the eye-fi card which is something you should definitely check out.  I was (am?) worried about the number of customers who said this did not work underwater and ruined their sd cards.  This camera has two doors to protect the battery/sd card compartment.  The manual warns to not close them together, but to shut/lock the inner door and then shut the outer door.  I can see how it might seem you just need to close the top door.  I'll be paying attention to that and will update on how it does.  More to come....Update (moving 4 stars to 5):I have now taken the camera on a snorkeling trip and it did great.  No leaking at all. Definitely make sure you shut the inner door and then the outer door.  On a guided snorkeling trip, the guide took my camera and took pics and videos for me.  He dived down quite deep a few times to get shots down in crevices and those turned out great.  For videos that I took, I merely started the video, then pointed it in the same general area I was moving.  Trying to see the viewfinder underwater is difficult as some have said.  But who wants to look through a viewfinder when you're snorkeling live? :-)  I definitely recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "ok for the price", "Author": "dissatisfied", "ReviewID": "R3T5AEIP5Z3RB0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The pics are decent.

It just says Kodak for 7 min, so odd. In my situation that is a complete downer because I mow 30 properties a day I want to turn it off while I am driving to the next property to save on AA battery life but its pointless because it will just stay on anyway.Also 4 stars because with the memory card having pictures on it you cannot review a photo without the camera saying processing for 5 min. Again servicing 30 properties a day and I need to see if I got a shot or not I did keep making the mistake of hitting that button the first few days.

I didn't want to spend another $200 for another camera that I knew I might possibly lose again since we float rough rapids. I wanted a waterproof camera because we kayak alot and I needed something that we could take with us to capture our adventures. My girlfriend is always raving about Kodak Easyshare cameras and how she has always had great luck with them. So I figured for the price, why not give it a shot. After the second day, I was HOPING the river would claim it so I would never have to see it again. Finally my girlfriend even got sick of it and asked me to return it. The best thing about it all was that they were great about accepting the product back. They had UPS come to my house and pick it up the next day and within a week I had the money refunding to my account. I use Amazon a lot, I never write reviews unless I love a product. Just in the last 6 months I have ordered about 50 items from Amazon, and this is the only item I have EVER returned.Pros:It turned onIt took picturesIt was waterproofCons:5 times we selected to delete one picture, it would delete ALL of them.

Overall, it takes very nice photos. I did experience the issue that others have mentioned that after it has been in the water, even just for short periods of time, and not totally submerged, the colors on the screen become washed out and the LCD screen becomes almost totally useless. I did what I read others had done - took out the batteries and memory card and let it dry out overnight and it worked fine the next day. The interesting part is, sometimes it would take photos fine while the screen was washed out and not working and sometimes that is actually how your photos would turn out - no way to know for sure though.Generally though, it took great photos under water and on land as well. Just know that as soon as you put it in water, you'll likely not be able to use it again until the next day. Given the cost of the camera, I wasn't that disappointed.
