If you have gotten to this bundle you have already decided on the RX100 and are just trying to get some additional value as I was. I will not speak to the quality of the Camera as that has been done much better than I could do.I managed to get the Camera today with the associated goodies.What you get for your $11 premium over the camera alone are:Spare battery -- not Sony brand it says it is 1600mah vs 1240mah for the stock Sony time will tell if that is accurateTripod --------- Zeikos brand its tiny-- pocket size-- it even has a clip for your pocket. Not complaints for what it is.Cleaning kit --- A small bottle of fluid, 5 q-tips, and a small microfiber snippit.Camera case ---- Vivitar brand Meh it will do nothing fancy better than letting it get banged against car keys in a purse.Card reader ---- Zeikos brand it will do the job and I suppose if you don't want to plug the camera into the computer its ok.LCD protector -- Zeikos brand a universal product you have to cut to fit, the cardboard squeege with it scratches it up:(32GB SDHC ------ Sony Brand item #SF-32NX this is what you are paying for. $23.20 with prime is the cheapest on Amazon.Sony SF32NX/TQ 32GB SDHC Class 10 Memory CardSo in summary in my opinion the only thing really worth the price in order of value are the Sony 32gb card-- that alone is a steal. The tripod is nice I can see it being useful and who doesn't like a spare battery even if it is cheap and craps out quickly it is basically free. The rest are junk and if I would have known the lcd screen protectors would scratch so easily I would have ordered a good one already cut to fit with the camera.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE this camera", "Author": "Suzanne M.

It captured great video quality and very decent sound inside a 1000 year old dark cathedral, wonderful panoramic shots and the stills are also spectacular. Love that it fits in my pocket, metal body, and great lens. Best all around camera I've ever owned. Only thing that's missing is a bigger zoom but gosh, this little thing packs a lot of great features. Own a Sony Nex 5 with several lenses that I also like a lot but it's large for travel. Have also owned Nikon SLR and bought a Canon S100 that I returned because of bum picture quality.

The camera is just as featured, its 20.2 MP resolution exceptional, and its recipient delighted.

Bjornseth \"Dick Bjornseth\"", "ReviewID": "R1K51SEH4XBY13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hate to admit this, but I now own 8 digital cameras (too many) ranging from an Altoids box sized Pentax to a Fuji X100, to two  Infrared-converted cameras, to full frame Canon Mark II 5D.  Was looking for that ideal combination of a pocketable camera with a decent-sized sensor and some zoom capabilities and the Sony RX100 is in a class by itself that fits the bill.  Have now used this camera for several months and am thrilled with the results.  The best things about this camera are it's unique combination of small size, large sensor, and top resolution.  No need to carry around a dslr on a daily basis in case I see something worth photographing - which is every day.  This guy fits easily in my pants pocket - not possible with the 4/3 cameras with their bigger lens. I have a 27 inch monitor and the images of the Sony appear to be the same resolution and quality as a dslr.A few other comments: 1. As others may have indicated, the only small flaw (if you even want to call it a flaw) is that the access door to the SD card and battery appears a little flimsy - but I've never had any trouble with it.2. Some sort of grip or texture on the front might be nice, but I've added a leather Gariz 1/2 case that provides a little better grip without adding much to the bulk.  Having compared and tested the Sony RX 100 to other compact-sized camera - including my slightly larger Olympus XZ-1 here are some final comments:  1. I find myself going to the Sony when I want especially high quality images. 2. I use the Olympus when I want easy access to special effects such as \"dramatic tone\" or \"pop art\" or \"pin hole.\"  The higher price of the Sony RX 100 (over $600) is worth it to me - especially if I want enlargements beyond 13 x 19.  Otherwise the Olympus XZ-1 is a perfect lower- priced pocket camera with outstanding capabilities as well.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best purchase I've made recently", "Author": "Jennifer Boyle", "ReviewID": "R2CK6CPAM6DKDG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this up just prior to leaving on vacation to the Grand Canyon.

I'm still learning what this camera can do (and it appears to do almost anything a photographer would want), but at first blush, it thoroughly meets my expectations (and then some).  One of the best things is its size...it's small enough and light enough to fit into my purse (or could be worn in a case on one's belt), so it will get used.

Although I use mainly the Macro lens (for photographing small items that I sell on-line), I appreciate all the features and the fact that the camera automatically adjusts to different situations.  My only quibble is that this camera does not come with a battery recharger and the ones offered for purchase as substitutes do not work.  However, I have luckily found a source for inexpensive X batteries.  The ones offered by Sony are expensive, and believe me, this camera eats up batteries.  Also note: this camera gives no warning that the battery is low.

The menus I believe are set in quite an intuitive way and give access to lots of shooting options and features and you can customize the function's menu to suit your preferences. The ring around the lens with which you can control the diaphragm aperture, the manual focusing or other functions which you can assign to it, feels great. It is also great that you can take pictures directly in Raw (for which you will need to use a program as could be Image Data Converter ver.4 that you can download freely form Sony`s web site, capable of correcting the strong optical distortions produced by the lens at some of the focal distances it covers and which the camera corrects automatically when shooting for jpg) and that the sensor, apart from being quite big considering this is a compact camera, covers a 12 EV dynamic range. Noise is not too visible in images nor bothers much below 1600 ISO, which is good enough. It has a pop-up springloaded flash which you can twist backwards to bounce the light on a ceiling when the camera is in a horizontal position or against a wall if it is in a vertical position, which is a nice detail. As with any camera without an optical viewfinder, with just an LCD screen, taking pictures under the sun can be tricky. Not a good camera for macros (most compact cameras with smaller sensors can do better in this respect) as it only focuses at short distances with the zoom at its widest angle. The same can be said for the maximum aperture, which closes rapidly as soon as you zoom-in just a bit, though it stays big enough anyway. In spite of some minor drawbacks, I would recommend this camera for anyone that can do with a 28 to 100 mm (35mm equivalent) focal length zoom and does not need the camera to shoot macro photos of flowers nor close-ups of birds, but want near DSLR quality images delivered by a pocket size camera.Regarding the bundle which is being offered by this seller, I would say it is worth paying for it. Except for the \"deluxe case\", which is not a great deal (the one I got is too big for just the camera), the rest of the accessories are fine and I think that having a spare battery is a must and if not as part of a bundle, you ought to buy one anyway.PS. (added): The lighting of the flash is quite weak (it has a very low guide number). It is of course strong enough so as to be able to trigger (using the camera in Manual mode) a photo cell from an independent speedlight which could be used nearby or beside the camera as slave to achieve more flash power.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super camera!", "Author": "DC", "ReviewID": "R6TDSWZYOJ1IE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An incredibly versatile pocket sized camera.

From range finders to SLRs to compacts to smartphones.  This camera truly hits the sweet spot.  The advantage to this camera is that it has the versatility of an SLR except for lens interchangeability and the size of a compact.  The resolution of the images is stunning and they can be cropped without losing much definition.  It has a fast lens and can shoot in very low light - perfect for indoor candid photos of children.  I don't use the zoom lens much indoors since the aperture drops off as you zoom in.  It is easier to simply crop the photo later and not sacrifice definition by increasing the ISO.  I have it set up so it is virtually silent.For those who want to be able to go full manual and set aperture as well as shutter speed and ISO this camera has it all.  Sony left very little out on that side things.  It also has HDR settings and exposure compensation.  The automatic focus is very fast, close to the speed of a DSLR.How could it be made better?  A lens that does not close down on the aperture throughout the zoom would be nice.  An articulating screen would be a plus as would built in wifi and gps.  Some of those things would probably add bulk, however.  One thing that should be added is a small grip to the right side of the camera.  Unfortunately, the camera is so sleek it feels as though it will easily slip out of your hand if you hold it one-handed.  I added an aftermarket grip for about $34.00 and it was worth every penny.This is not a cheap camera.  It is almost double what a \"good\" compact camera costs.  On the other hand, I have not found a truly pocketable camera that is remotely close to the images this camera can produce.  I was considering a DSLR, but when I thought about lugging a big camera with extra lenses around when I travel I thought I would try this.  I'm glad I did.

I own a Rebel XT and a Nikon S8100 and neither one takes as sharp of a photo as the Sony.  My Canon is too big to bring to family events and the Nikon started making clicking noises as if it can't find it's focus point.  Stops if I put it on fixed focus.  Very annoying in video. Been repaired once under warranty.  Canon takes great photos, but I wanted something the size of the Nikon I could keep in my pants pocket.  This fit the bill.Still are so sharp and lifelike.  The scene selector wheel give a brief overview of what the setting does.  Nice feature to help learn all the functions.  I still have not learned all the features and I sometimes get oddities;  taking a photo of my daughter it took what I had in the viewer and also a close up of her face.  Don't know why, doe this only if I am close to my subject, so it might be a portrait feature.  With some settings the camera takes a few seconds to \"Process\" the photos, which slows down the action if you are trying to take several photos in a close succession.  Might be my fault since I'm still figuring out how it all works.Videos with the Sony are sharp, but when I put it on the video selection, they are too dark.  Video works best under normal settings.

The 32GB SD Card was a Sony Class 10, perfect.  The extra battery was a Vivitar, which works as well as the original Sony, perfect.  The case is not bad - good size for the camera, but no pockets and a cheap strap.  The SD card to USB adapter is a Vivitar - if you need it I'm sure it works fine.  Ditto the little tri-leg stand.  Only complaint is the screen protector - worthless!  You must cut to size and it peels off immediately.All-in-all a very nice addition to a great camera.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "very nice product.", "Author": "Xiaming L.", "ReviewID": "R3M3URJ7D90JSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is so light and so powerful, if you need a very light camera with high quality performance, I strongly recommend this one.", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "What a GREAT camera and kit", "Author": "Dennis Bennett", "ReviewID": "R2UCU8YACFLUL4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a few different pocket cameras, which were good for snap shots, but with no manual controls, often times I couldn't capture an image the way I wanted to. The reason I sometimes carried a pocket camera is because I didn't want to carry a full size DSLR due to weight and bulk (for example - when hunting or fishing in the mountains).The Sony RX100 reminds me of the old Leica rangefinders with all of the manual controls, but much, much more capability. It's GREAT in low light, and the image quality allows me to make beautiful enlarged metal prints.

I'm not a videoguy I am a shooter so this review is based on what a camera is SUPPOSED to do, that is provide sharp images.I tested it against 2 premium cameras; my EOS 5D (original 12mp)with an EF 28-105mm and my Panasonic dmc-LX1 (the best point and shoot of 2005)the same scene was shot at 28 and 100mm with the same f stops at iso 100.The result;The 5D combo with the 28-105 was last, perhaps a 24-70L would have fared better since there was a bit more color represented in the scene.The rx100 was second place-YES SECOND. The image was the largest, but the lens sharpness, color and contrast was not up to the Lens on the LX1. The right side and the upper left corner were slightly less sharp than the center.The LX1's Leica simply is the sharpest lens to the edges and has the most striking contrast and colors (I paid $39 on Ebay for it!!). I'm sure at iso200 and up it would be last due to grain and its old processor, but this result is making me think that the LX7 may be the sharper shooter than the RX100, I have already seen some sample tests online that show it has a more uniform image.Do your homework and compare them before buying.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great small camera", "Author": "Ramos Apulan", "ReviewID": "RGAR757RDQ3VB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only used this camera for a week now and I can say that this is a great small camera.
