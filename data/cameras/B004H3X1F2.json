{"Reviews": [{"Title": "casio Ex-zr100", "Author": "esper88", "ReviewID": "R19HF5IDD20CKZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a small light little camera with lots of muscle. I does all of its basic jobs well. HDR ( high dynamic range) works well and is a great addition. Panorama shots are the best I have encountered. What does it lack (Raw file support ) the manufacturers description  of what the camera does is a little off. It is touted as a high speed camera , which it is, but the faster you ask it to go the smaller the pictures gets.It is a very good and interesting camera that takes very high quality digital pictures. It is not quite up to newer cameras and is a little pricey, but has some interesting capabilities that make up for what it lacks. It gives the user a lot of control over almost every aspect of digital photography. I get special cameras to do special jobs and this is a sweet little machine for someone who knows what they want.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT bit of gear...", "Author": "BigBilly", "ReviewID": "R24VRB8L2Z3KVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera primarily to have a relatively inexpensive high-speed camera in a point-and-shoot sized package.  It has vastly exceeded my expectations in all categories.For an example of what a novice is capable of producing with this Casio gem, please visit YouTube and go to /watch?v=ma7tQ4kS_xUThe controls may not be the most intuitive for everyone and the manual is largely useless, but after you have flipped all the switches, pressed all the buttons and played with the camera in different lighting conditions it will become second nature.As a bonus, this camera takes very nice shots offhand, has a great sequential photograph feature and is capable of extremely fast shutterspeeds.  This is a great camera for photographing sports action or wildlife when you don't want to tote an SLR and camera bag around.Great for the outdoors enthusiast / camera enthusiast who prefers to be IN the action rather than sidelined by the camera.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!!", "Author": "IJW", "ReviewID": "R14JWS9AS1VB02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had Exilim cameras before and that's why I keep going back.

Sad they left that out on the video. The camera has the shutter speed on the camera picture taking but not on the video capture.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Richard Tan \"Rich bloke\"", "ReviewID": "R3R1HC3JM53QTC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loved the features in this camera simple to use lots of selection and fast too, great color sharp pictures could not ask for better.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this.", "Author": "Amazon lover", "ReviewID": "R3EGTW6M0YY4IB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know why it is so expensive on Amazon but I bought it 16,000 Yen at Japanese online store. About $200.USPS doesn't take lithium battery from other country so we have to buy battery in here though.I don't know much about mechanical things and I'm proud of it but this camera works pretty good for me. I take pictures flowers, bugs, dogs, cats,,, something like that.Battery life is very long.Micro is very clear.Very bright. Dark room at night, still good without flash.It is easy to handle.Monitor is big enough.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004H3X1F2"}}
