{"Reviews": [{"Title": "good quality, easy to use camera", "Author": "Matthew Cordeiro", "ReviewID": "R88JBOCKF38N4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The DSC S980 is the 2nd Cybershot I've purchased.  The first one lasted 4 years before it was time for an upgrade.  I tested the camera on a Disney World vacation before writing this review.The camera itself is light and compact.  It lacks a view finder (great for sunny days) but compensates with an above average sized LCD screen.  It runs on a series K Sony lithium ion battery (included).  I got about 250 pictures on the initial charge.  The camera requires a Sony memory card (not included), which is not the same size as an SD card.  Accessories include photo software (not yet tested), a USB cable to connect to the computer, a video/mono audio RCA cable to connect to the TV, and a battery wall charger.The face recognition and image stabilizer work well.  The camera has a number of user friendly settings ranging from an easy mode to somewhat more advanced settings for distance and lighting.  I used the movie setting once - decent picture quality, mediocre sound quality.Overall, a great camera for the price that withstood the rigors of a Disney vacation and gave me hundreds of good pictures.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Still pictures good, Video is disappointing", "Author": "D. Rude", "ReviewID": "R3L7C4RL8L4WET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is great for still pics, they are very crisp.  The sound for the camera, however, leaves much to be desired.  Even up close, you can barely make out what is being said when in play-back mode.  When hooked up to my TV you have to turn the TV sound way up to hear it.  This was definitly disappointing.  Again though, the still pics are good, I'm a nanny for 3 young kids and get great pics of them with it!", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Easy, lightweight and compact", "Author": "R.

It is easy to use (point and click as I am a technophobe), compact and lightweight.  The pictures we have taken so far have all been good quality and even when zooming the quality does not appear to be affected. Would definately recommend it.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Value for money", "Author": "Anoop Vishwakarma \"-av\"", "ReviewID": "RJTD7A3M0HI59", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last week after getting frustrated with the ultra-short battery life with NiMH batteries on my Kodak cameras.- The camera is slick! Very small and very smooth operationGoodies like on screen live histogram helps you capture better images- Very Long battery life - I took the battery out of the box and used it without charging it. Captured about 80 shots so far (most with flash) and it still is showing about 3/4 battery available. I have read other user stating that it really goes all the way up to about 380 shots on a SINGLE charge. This is what I love about this camera.- Large LCD (no view finder) makes taking pictures easy)- Easy and intuitive controls on the camera back- Efficient power management (like lens automatically withdraws when reviewing pictures, auto shut down when idle)- Photos are good (I am a casual photographer - not professional). I would not rate them excellent - the Kodak had better pictures- The camera does not like very bright light sources in front of it. The LCD as well as the picture taken has pink/purple streaks on it when bright light sources are present. Not very goodOverall - a pretty good camera given what you pay for it - under 150$ and reliable quality from Sony!", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Deana S.

Then last year we saw a camera when were were at a show in Vegas that was to be the next greatest thing - so we laid down another $500... Well, even with the stabilizer on, that new camera couldn't take a clear shot so feeling a little burned we put our HP back into operation.  Recently, our 18month old started to get her hands on the HP camera and it suffered abuse that quickly put it out of commission.  With the holiday upon us, we needed to quickly get a new camera.I had done a little research in anticipation but... by the time you compile your info, new stuff is always out...THE REVIEW: That said, we wanted to get a camera that would live up to the standards set by our HP but didn't want to buy another $500 camera.  So on a 20 minute shopping spree in Target, we compromised and got this SONY Cybershot DSC-S980 camera for $150 + 2GB memory card for $25 (Memory Stic Duo).  The memory card is a must as the camera only holds a few photos.1) It was pretty easy to just pick up and use without looking at the manual... but we did skim it to make sure we didn't miss anything.2) This was said to have a faster regeneration speed than others in it's class which was very important to us... we are not disappointed but it is certainly not faster than our HP which had a 3-5 second delay.3) This camera has a 4x optical zoom - our last had 10x and we definitely notice when taking shots from further away.4) The steadyshot feature is decent but we still get blurry pics when trying to take many shots quickly.5) It has a self timer - which was a mandatory feature for us.6) It has a video mode - another mandatory feature for us...7) It is small enough for my husbands pocket or my purse...8) It does not have a view finder but we are not concerned - the display is actually larger than our HP display was...9) The batter charge is a compact wall unit - no cords.10) The battery lasted well over 200 pics/1 week the first time we fully charged it. (The manual indicates 330 still images on one charge)11) The photo software (Picture Motion Browser) seemed to take a long time to install on our computer but works well.12) Comes with dedicated USB cable and dedicated A/V cable.13) Red-eye correction works but doesn't catch them all.14) It has other \"standard features\" like Black & White and Sepia modes, Burst mode, scene selection... but not panoramic mode as our HP camera had...15) The 12.1mp has not proven to be a great improvement over our 8.1mp HPAll-in-all - the is a great, portable camera for the money - but don't expect professional results.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "Sally", "ReviewID": "R3H12JP39VD8QA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really love this camera because it's a definite upgrade from my 5 mega pixel camera. I wish the sound was better on the mic though. It feels so small and delicate I always feel I'm going to break it. Other than that I really like it. It takes great pictures. Just remember to buy a memory card with plenty of room if you want to take large pictures and film videos. I also like the fact that on the dial you can go to \"P\" which are your personalized settings, or the little green camera which are the default settings. I thought that was really great. I figures out how to use it rather quickly..about 5 minutes of just playing with it. I didn't really read the manual. For the price, it's a pretty good camera.", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Angie B.", "ReviewID": "R1OFFGOORXE1OO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent compact camera.
