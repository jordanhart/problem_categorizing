I am not a professional at all...but of the pictures I've taken...so many of them are sharp and clear and exactly what I wanted in a camera.  I am still learning all the features and know with time and practice I'll achieve a much higher quality of camera.  I have been pleased with the 18 - 140 zoom lens.
