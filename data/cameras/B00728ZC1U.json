I wanted a waterproof camera so I wouldn't have to worry about ruining it in rain, snow, dirt, or anything else I throw at it.Here are some my favorite things about this camera:-It has a really fast shutter speed so it captures subjects in motion without blur.-It has a burst function that takes lots of pictures in a row, and so far they have come out incredible. I recently went cliff jumping and got some really good progressive shots of people falling in the air.-The camera has really good speakers when playing back video.-Picture quality is fantastic for a point and shoot, both inside and out. Some pictures taken in darker rooms turn out grainy, but that has happened with all my other cameras in the past.-The wrist strap is adjustable so it can be securely fit to your wrist while in the water.-The interface is really quick and easy to use.-The camera turns on incredibly fast so it's good for spur of the moment photo-ops.-You don't have to change settings between photo and video, you just push a different button for video to start recording. This is really nice because on my previous camera I often forgot to switch it back to photo mode and would take videos instead of pictres.All in all I love this camera. I don't have any complaints about it yet and I would definitely recommend it! I would also recommend buying a spare battery. The charge holds pretty well but if you are using it a lot in a day it's better to be safe and have a spare just in case. Wouldn't want to miss any great opportunities for a picture!TO ADD ON:I recently had my camera at the beach and someone dropped it in the sand. All the cracks had sand in them, so I was a little worried. I just filled my sink with water and sat the camera in in for about 10 minutes, and all the sand just fell off. It's like nothing even happened! I was so happy since my previous camera was ruined by sand.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid", "Author": "Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R2MV0LHBC4P1A8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera a few months ago after researching waterproof digital cameras and reviews extensively. The price has come down a bit from what I paid, but it was worth every penny. My camera has been in the water in San Diego, Cabo San Lucas, and Maui. It has survived in my boardshorts pocket while:Surfing - heard it knock against my board multiple timesbody surfingswimming in riverjumping off 20 ft waterfallHave taken video underwater with good quality. This camera is great. Hopefully it will last longer than my previous waterproof cam that was by a different manufacturer, but I didn't properly care for that one. I've been more committed to using the suggested maintenance procedures when using this one, like soaking it in a bowl of water after having it in salt water and keeping the seal clean with the brush they provide. The pictures are sharp and defined - high quality.In 7 days in Cabo I didn't have to recharge the battery once. I expect this camera to last for years.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's okay, but has issues.", "Author": "Anthony Burokas", "ReviewID": "R1Y7WIQ35SHBIX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have to admit, that I wanted to like this camera. It was to replace my old and now, not working, Olympus SW720- a precursor to the \"tough\" cameras. That camera went through a lot and kept working, till the screen went white for no apparent reason, but I digress...This camera is thin & light. It has a 4x zoom (longer than my old cam). It shoots HD video (not SD like my old cam). It doesn't have a lens cover to jam up on sand, like my old cam. More resolution. Panny's \"intelligent resolution\" to ensure sharper looking images and \"intelligent exposure\" to brighten some darker areas. I looked forward to using it.But the image quality was not up to what I expected. Even bright daylight photos, with a forced flash to fill dark detail, when you look at the photos at 100%- the images just get muddy and undefined, they lack the detail I'd expect. In darker situations, image quality deteriorates pretty quickly. I tried forcing the ISO to 100. I tried letting the camera pick everything. I tried dropping the frame size in case it was \"interpolating\" to a higher resolution. Nothing helped. At best, some images are \"nice\" but none are great. Some suck. Several wee missed because the camera wasn't focused. I mean- on the beach, there's my boy, and the whole shot is out of focus. What did it focus on? I have no idea.The video is rough and heavily compressed. Audio is \"eh.\" Audio in my old camera was bad too. I guess that's the nature of being an underwater camera. But why is the microphone on TOP of the camera when the lens is capturing something in FRONT of the camera.Battery lasted one day of occasional shooting, with more photos on the beach, but maybe 50 - 70 shots (I shoot a lot in a row when the kids are doing something interesting) total before I had to recharge the wafer-thin little battery. I admit the camera is thin, easily pocketable. Convenient. But that extra thinness also made it a bit harder to grip while my hands were wet. I'd prefer something chunkier. Then it could have a bigger battery.I tried to shoot a couple panoramas with the camera. It stitches and crops the image in the camera and, no matter what I did, the panos are very small. Maybe that's just how they are- lower resolution than actual stills. A lot lower resolution. Plus, exposure changes throughout the shot made it look weird. But I was impressed at how well it handled houses that would be \"bent\" because of the wide angle curve of the lens. Sony's in-camera pano mode has fared worse in this regard, but Sony delivers higher resolution stills and the exposure is locked through the pano. Also, Sony reliably gave me a pano each time (even if the pano sucked). The Panny would error out about half the time because I was going too slow, too fast, whatever. I don't know. As I didn't buy this underwater camera for panos, I don't hold that against the score of the camera.Lastly, there's two places you really expect to use an underwater camera- the pool & the beach. It was fine in the pool and the wrist lanyard was very good. But at the beach, when you get some sand on your hands because, well, it's THE BEACH... the sand gets under the shutter trigger and, again, I was missing photo opportunities because I couldn't press the damm shutter button. The video button still worked, but why would they not expect that SAND might be present at the most common areas on the planet where there's water- the beach.Some vigorous sloshing in the sea while pressing the shutter button worked the sand free and I was able to take more pictures.Pros:- small, lightweight, thin- waterproof, submersible- shoots HD video, big stills- can force the flash, can compensate the exposure, set spot focus/exposure, manually set ISO- has some scene modes that help a little with dark shotsCONS:- high resolution is lost when you actually look at the stills- video is grainy- a little too thin for my hands- debris can get under the shutter button preventing you from taking a picture- sometimes focuses on... nothingI really wasn't expecting DSLR-like quality, but I wanted better, and I wanted reliability, not missed shots.

The camera is made of mostly metal and feels very solid and durable. It is very compact and fits in my pocket without a problem, a big plus+ for traveling and wanting to avoid carrying a big camera.  Also, having this camera made me feel more comfortable about not scratching or damaging it because it is made to be handled without the 'white glove' treatment.  I'll get to the main point of having this camera; it does take really nice pictures -- outdoors / indoor and with good light. Night time pictures can be a bit tricky and you will have to play with the scene settings. Just like MOST small compact cameras, their strong points are NOT taking pictures in low-light situations.  Don't forget, this camera is waterproof and can take picture / video under water.  I haven't tried this feature, yet.  Will this camera replace a DSLR or micro 4/3 camera?  Not quite.  It will be a great in taking quick snapshots when you want to go out and not worry about carrying an expensive camera/equipment.  For example, going out for dinner with your wife/husband and/or friends.... IMHO you really don't want to be carrying any big camera ( I have a micro 4/3 camera and I think it is sometimes a bit big to carry in certain situations).  Did I mention that it fits easily in your pocket?  If you are looking for professional photos, this will not meet your needs. If you are looking for a rugged, all-around fun, waterproof and durable camera that takes great pictures, the Panasonic TS20 will fit your needs... especially at a reasonable price.

I was looking for a camera that took quality digital pictures of things standing still, moving objects/animals, and a camera that took quick pictures to get those moving objects.  I purchased the 32GB SDHC digital card for use, which was a little overkill, but it can hold over 4,000 pic's using the 16MB quality.Decision Points- Quality Pic's - from color to contrast is awesome.- Shutter Speed allowed me to get great pic's of objects moving clearly...to include a Tomahawk being thrown.- Easy to use, hooked right up to my MAC- Zoom for what I want to use it for is good, I will give up distance for the quality of pic's. (I would NOT recommend this camera if you are taking pic's of your child's soccer game and they are across the field, quality will be good but it won't be a closeup picture.)- Battery Power - I did not put the battery on a time; however, after a few days of taking pic's on and off through out the day I had to recharge the battery.  I plan on purchasing an additional battery.- I have NOT tested the waterproofing, I am sure my husband will drop it in the water soon enough to give a review on the waterproofing.  (Rated at 16Ft for 60min)- The camera is also rated at 5Ft for Anti-Shock Performance (again another good thing with my husband)- The camera is also rated at a temperature between 14deg F to 104deg F. This camera will be used anywhere from Alaska to Afghanistan so temperature variations was also a factor in our purchase of the Lumix.- It is a small camera that can easily fit in a hunting pocket out in the woods or in a combat vest pouch when deployed.Overall we are very happy with our decision to purchase the Lumix, it does everything we need it to do for our active lifestyle.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Died a watery death after 33 days", "Author": "farul ghazali", "ReviewID": "R34T8EIIQAD3M3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worked fine for a few weeks, the camera was used mostly in my Intex pool, never in salt water.

They also told me that if it required repair, it might be $140 or $180 - the CS rep didn't seem to understand the silliness of that price for a camera that cost $139 brand new.I'm sad writing this review, because I've had great luck with Lumix cameras over the years, but this was really frustrating!", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "product description", "Author": "Kimatthebeach", "ReviewID": "RVZGIF649M0SB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I could not find the list of contents in the product description.

The good thing is that this is a 16 MP camera, so if you are not making a poster print, the quality is still ok; however, you will need a lot of storage space since the pictures are huge. This camera doesn't have the 60 second exposure time which the Lumix normally have.  The panoramic function is unacceptable and unnecessary since it already have a 25 mm lens.  At a glance the miniature effect seems cool, but this effect has nothing to do with depth of field, rather it is a simple process that blurs out the top and bottom portion of the picture to create such \"effect\".  The screen has an additional setting to increase the view angle from the bottom.  It is useful when you have to take pictures over head. However, the viewing angle from the top of the screen is limited so its hard to take pictures down low.  The zoom buttons are too sensitive when you are holding the camera with one hand.So far this is a good little rugged camera for casual shooting such as a day out at the beach, fishing trip, party, sport event, etc.  It is light, small, and fast thus allowing you to carry it through out the day and catch any moment of your choice.Con:-Image not as sharp.-useless panoramic-zoom button too sensitive-fake miniature effectPro:-25 mm wide angle-fast shoot-highly portable-waterproof", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not waterproof", "Author": "MattK", "ReviewID": "R32DB6D6M57O12", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Used the camera for a week on land, and worked as expected.

I know it only takes 720p video but that was better than my old waterproof Olympus Stylus 850 and the price seemed right.  I was concerned by the number of reviews that noted problems with water entering the camera but figured that it was a result of not following the directions or asking the camera to do things it was not designed to do. I have had my old Olympus that has probably over 12 to 15 hours of actually sitting in salt water and never had a problem so I kind of dismissed the reviews of water leakage.  I read the directions and played with the camera before my trip to the Caribbean last week and thought all was well.  Wrong!My first day on our cruise while in St. Thomas we were on a turtle snorkel and the camera failed in less than 15 minutes in the water.  I had placed a freshly charged battery and a new SD card and was ready to film some turtles.  I double checked the seal of the camera and thought all was well but after about 10 minutes or so I noticed some video noise on the LCD screen.  I swam over to the boat but now had no picture on the LCD Screen.  I opened the battery compartment to find some water inside along the SD card and battery. The boat crew laughed as they have seen this a lot. I got as much moisture out of the compartment as possible and wrapped the camera in a towel.  Back on the ship I dried everything out and reinserted the battery but the camera was gone.  The LCD screen worked in the menus and I could view the few photos I had taken but the camera could no longer take photos.  I was lucky to pack my old Olympus waterproof camera and it proceed to work well the rest of the trip adding another 3+ hours of underwater use.The Lumix must have a design problem because the seal looks cheap.  I was never in water deeper than 3 feet because we had to swim with a vest and didn't swim waving the camera in the water.  Comparing the older Olympus with the new Lumix water seal I must say that the Olympus has a much better looking seal and snaps down with some pressure.  The Lumix does not!  This is not a Waterproof Camera!I'd say if you want a camera that doesn't need to go into the water or is used in mist or light rain the Lumix might be worth a try.

The center of the photo is reasonably sharp -- or as sharp as one has the right to expect for a camera in this price range.  But the picture becomes blurred as you go towards the edges.  On my camera, this was especially pronounced on the right side, with one-third of the frame unacceptably blurry. This is probably due to a poor quality or defective lens.

We took pictures and video clips both on land and underwater.  At the end of the day, I still had plenty of battery left.  It handled the salt water and the sand just fine.

I haven't used a point and shoot in about 5 years so I'm mainly comparing this camera to Nikon SLR's (I know not a fair comparison at all but at least I know that). As far as image quality goes ...well, let's just say it's a fun camera. I recently put it through it's paces during Songkran 2012 in Thailand and even compared to my buddies Oly TG-610 ...image quality is horrible. Compared to my 5 or 6 year old Canon G7 ...image quality is horrible. Video is way too grainy also.That said, this is a 170.00 USD camera and it is just about the smallest, lightest, waterproof out there so it's just what I wanted. I was able to take shots in places I wouldn't even dare take the SLR. I was able to throw it around, give it to other people to take shots, keep it in my pocket and capture some great memories.Would I recommend it ...yes and no, as long as you know that it's a total piece of junk image quality wise ...I love the little guy though and will take it along next time, it's that fun. I also had no expectations and knew going in it wouldn't compare to much else out there but hey, it's fun, really fun, and cheap, really cheap. If your looking for the best IQ and such, well, this isn't the camera. If your looking for fun and memories, this may be your camera. Small, light, tough and above all else, well, fun.Bottom Line: it's $170.00 ...you get what you pay for ...and for that price, you get a camera that just works and isn't a hassle to carry.Oh yeah ...mini mode takes outstanding shots, panorama is quite interesting, and the whole iA mode is pretty much useless. I'm not sure why Panny doesn't just tweek the camera to make every shot come out with the colors and sharpness of the mini mode without the blur.It's a tough rate ...I'm giving it three stars overall.

Only this last week did I get a chance to float the same section of river and attempt a rescue.  Sure enough, my Lumix was waiting for me (now only under 5 feet of water), perched on a rock ledge and just barely visible through the algae that had started to grow on it.  This camera spent 2 MONTHS underwater, and when I pulled it from what should have been it's watery grave, all it took was an hour of charging the battery for it to be back in full operating condition.  It works totally perfectly!  That, to me, is incredible.

I took it on a recent vacation to Mexico and began using it on the day we went to Xcaret, where we would be swimming, snorkeling, etc. I took a few land pictures and all seemed fine. Then we went into the water and after only taking 5-6 pictures, the LED screen went white and would no longer function. (Note: I had checked and double checked the battery door to make sure it was sealed tightly before I started using the camera.) I was extremely upset, as I would have no photos with which to remember this fun day. I tried pressing the shutter and the camera sounded like it was taking a photo, so I spent the rest of the day pointing the camera in the direction of what I wanted to photograph, depressing the shutter, and hoping for the best. I didn't know if it was working or not, nor did I really know what I would end up with if it did work since I couldn't see anything on the LED screen. Back at the hotel I removed the memory card and inserted it into my other camera to see if any images had been captured, and surprisingly, they had. So I was at least able to have some pictures from that day. However, the camera is really useless without being able to use the LED screen. Apparently, the camera isn't as waterproof as it claims to be. All I can figure is that it must have leaked somehow and caused the malfunction. I immediately sent it back to Amazon when we got home. Luckily it was still (barely) within the 30 day return limit, as I had emailed Panasonic and they seemed like they were going to be less than helpful.I commend Amazon on their quick response with my return.

After having 2 incidents in 2 weeks with liquid damage on expensive electronics I decided to get something a bit more \"weatherproof\".I did alot of research for waterproof tough cams that apparently have just recently come back into vogue again. For the price you really couldn't beat the features on this one. If you wanted to spend 2x to 3x as much and pay for the Sony or Nikon they obviously have better picture quality, but for this price (I got it for $110 currently) you could not do better. Camera review sites seems to only factor in quality sans price. If price wasn't an object I wouldn't even be looking at a point and shoot so it seems kind of counter-intuitive to read a review website and have them tell you \"Your best bet is to buy the $350 Sony\"Picture Quality: It has alot of 'fuzz' in the pictures when you view them at full size. I thought this was because of point and shoots tenacity for raising the ISO to ridiculous levels but even with the ISO set to 200 or 400 manually it still has alot of fuzz. The tilt/shift \"mini\" mode is sort of fun, but takes a while to process and apply the effects and can be added to a greater degree in post processing (READ: Photoshop). Macro pictures seem to come out pretty decent and for some reason don't seem to have as much distortion/fuzz/blur. I haven't taken it underwater yet, it says it's for fresh or sea water only so I assume swimming pools being chlorinated are out (which is sort of the kicker unless you live by the beach). I'm not sure on salt water pools but I assume they should be ok.Video Quality: It's 720P it picks up motion ok and lower level light (not sure HOW low level but my test video came out very decent) is ok too. I filmed my wife and daughter rolling skater at sunset and the video was of acceptable quality.Summary: Over-all it's not stellar, but will suffice for our trip and will be a great camera (shock-proof waterproof) for my wife and daughter to use especially because even if she get's it grubby a quick rinse and it's good as new (I hope!). It's small will fit well in even a clutch purse or pocket, it's slim and lightweight. iA (Intelligent Autofocus) makes things EXTREMELY simple with facial recognition autofocus, auto flash, red-eye removal, and automatically detects when objects are close and switches to macro mode.

So I decided to buy a waterproof digital camera instead.  I wanted it for the main purpose of being able to kayak and not have to worry about the camera.  I just came back from a trip.  I kept the camera in my bathing suit pocket when not taking pictures.  I took quite a few from the kayak and no issues with water.  I put the camera in my pocket but later had to jump into the water to help a kayaker who fell out of their kayak.  I actually forgot it was there.  I got back into my kayak after swimming around for a few minutes, took the camera out and continued to use it.  When I got back to the hotel, I followed instructions, soaking it in fresh water for 10 minutes, let it dry and then accessed the memory card.  I had absolutely no problems.The only issue I had (and I figured it out pretty early) is that the drops I saw through the view finder were actually on the lens window (I'm used to view finders not being the lens) so some of my shots had water drops in the way.  I started wiping the lens window (calling it a window because the lens itself is protected) before taking a picture.  Underwater this would not have been an issue, but I was on top.The pictures are pretty large (about 3.5 - 5mb) because it is 16mp.  I'm used to 12mp which gives about 2-2.5mb, so I bought a larger SD card.  The pictures were pretty good.  Not quite as good as my Panasonic Lumix ZS5, but much better than a throwaway.  The zoom is only good enough for framing a picture, but again, more zoom than the throwaways I've used.  Size-wise, it is a little thinner than the ZS5 and fits into a men's pants or shorts pocket (we all know women's pants and shorts can barely hold a credit card).

It's a very low cost, you might even say near-disposable, underwater camera.  Read through the reviews for any underwater camera and you will find complaints about water leakage, so none of these products are infallible.  My view is that it's better to have a lower-cost model with some compromises when none of the alternatives are going to have perfect water protection, image quality, or ergonomics, because if something goes wrong, you can just buy another one.I'm not a serious underwater photographer; if I were, I'd want an SLR with an expensive underwater housing.  What I did want was something that could take a bit of a beating and go underwater, and as a bonus even survive to be used again in a similar fashion.  This by itself is an improvement over any standard compact camera, which (and I know from experience) will die a quick and hopefully painless death after even one curious if accidental foray into the briny deep.The TS20 is very small, very light, and the actual water sealing looks very flimsy - but it works.  Just don't expect a solid \"sealed vault\" feel to the door -- it closes, that's all, and it does keep the water out.The lens is unremarkable (somewhat slow), the LCD is a bit laggy, and the image quality is about what you'd expect (ok in good light, lousy otherwise), but you'll get pictures that you wouldn't otherwise have.  The 16 megapixel resolution is just a marketing spec; from a quality standpoint, a 16 megapixel raw image from something like a Nikon D7000 is going to be on another planet compared to what comes out of the TS20.

I've had no complaints so far, and the picture quality is very good, but up until a couple days ago it hasn't really seen any harsh use. But I just had an incredible experience so I just had to write a review.I was fishing from the rocky shore of a bay (it's like a bank of boulders going into the water) and set the camera down on some of the rocks. When I reached to pick it back up I clumsily knocked it off and watched and heard it tumble down between some of the rocks and into the water. At first I thought no big deal, after all that's why I use a waterproof camera (I hadn't even thought about the shockproofness), but I quickly found out it had fallen so far between the rocks that it was out of sight, and even worse out of reach. I spent probably 20 minutes with my shoes and pants soaked standing in the water reaching between the rocks and scratching up my hands but I couldn't find the camera. I was super bummed because I had just caught 2 types of fish that I'd never caught before and had those pictures on the camera, and also the SD card contained pictures of my pregnant wife's belly that we've been taking each week. So it was more about wanting the pictures back than the camera.I decided my best hope was to come back at low tide with a magnet on a string and see if I could see it and fish it out. Unfortunately that was on a Thursday evening and because of work the next low tide I had free was Saturday evening. After 2 days of dread I went back to the same spot where the camera fell (luckily I scratched the rocks with my pliers so I could find the same spot) and I was happy to see that the water level was significantly lower. In fact I was able to stand lower down on the rock bank and peek through a gap from the side and my heart lifted when I saw the camera sitting there. I was able to just reach in and grab it (I couldn't do that before because my head would have been under water). And the best part, I was amazed when i pushed the power button and the camera turned right on! I took some test pictures and everything was still working perfectly. What a relief.So in summary, after tumbling down rocks and spending 48 hours outdoors, half of that time under sea water, the camera survived. Later upon further inspection at home the only thing I noticed was a tiny bit of condensation in the lens and flash areas, but not in the screen.

Kudos to Panasonic & Amazon for being the first to hit the $100 price point with a legitimate tough cam (apologies to those in market but missed that sweet Gold Box deal).News of the death of the pocket digicam have been greatly exaggerated. Otterbox or no, my precious iPhone 4S is going nowhere near open water. Neither is my Nikon D3100, purchased largely out of disgust with typically awful digicam shutter lag. But not only does the TS20 love the water, it's a pretty snappy performer too. Press the shutter button and it actually takes a picture in an instant--a novel concept STILL missed by many affordable cameras.I also love the dedicated record button that allows you to instantly shoot video without having to worry about the mode dial or god forbid, hunt through the menus like some cameras. Speaking of video, 30 minutes in high def is pretty impressive, especially at this price. While the zoom buttons take a little getting used to, you need to understand the usual spring-loaded thumb lever is not easily water-proofed. Engineering is a science of compromise, so concessions are to be expected on any budget model.I was afraid one such concession would be picture quality, especially while under water (isn't that really why we buy \"tough\" cams?) After seeing online comparisons of tough cams costing 3 & 4 times the price, I was absolutely stunned how good the TS20's underwater photos looked! Outdoor shots looked fantastic too. No doubt there are artifacts, fringing, and whatever not seen with a Canon EOS 5D Mark III, but seriously for $99, or even $138, you're simply not going to beat this bang for the buck any time soon.Almost on cue, on day one I accidentally knocked the camera off a towel rack (while changing out of my bathing suit after taking the aforementioned pictures.) I was concerned its light plastic body wouldn't truly be rugged like other metal bodied bricks I've tried, but it slammed onto the cherry hardwood floor without a scratch or dent...to the camera that is.By all means if you are going heliskiing at Mt. Kilimanjaro, step up to the TS4 or Olympus TG-1; however if you simply want to be able to take pictures at or in the backyard pool and local waterpark, you simply cannot go wrong with this camera. To me part of the beauty is that, at least for my budget, it is one thing to break or lose a $100 toy, and an entirely other thing if replacement will set me back $300 or $400.

Now all I can think of is the old maxim \"You Get What You Pay For.\" In this case, I got a poor quality camera that even the manufacturer seems to acknowledge. Here are my quarrels with this camera and why you may want to look elsewhere in spite of the low price:1. POOR PICTURE QUALITY - Maybe it's the lens or the quality of the electronics, but the pictures I did manage to take with this camera were washed out and otherwise of poor quality (particularly in bright light situations). My camera phone did a better job in bright light situations.2. CONDENSATION ISSUES - I should have known something was up when Panasonic went so far as to put a special insert in the box about condensation issues and problems with the lens clouding over. Although Panasonic provides \"tips\" for avoiding this problem, my conclusion is that the design of this camera makes such issues unavoidable. After only a few weeks, and even following all the tips, the lens on this camera clouded over from condensation. The lens is now permanently cloudy and there is nothing you can do about it. The camera is rendered useless. I've used a lot of cameras in a lot of environments. This one is just not designed to take it. I am going to send this camera in for warranty service and I will post an addendum to let you know how it turns out. I'm not holding my breath that Panasonic will cover this problem.3. WATERPROOF SEALS ARE POOR QUALITY AND MUST BE REPLACED \"AT EXTRA COST\" YEARLY - That's right folks. Read the fine print. The requirements for keeping this camera waterproof read like a novel. Even if you do everything right, Panasonic says the flimsy waterproof seals need to be replaced every year at your cost. They surely don't tell you this up front. Can you imagine having to bring this $140 camera to an authorized repair facility every year and being charged for replacing the seals? Nobody is going to do that and Panasonic knows it. It's basically a disposable camera if you bring it in the water to begin with. After one year Panasonic admits it. Mine didn't make it past two months.I love praising a good product at a good price. This camera is not such a product. In my humble opinion, you would be better off spending a little more and getting a better waterproof camera that is truly as rugged as they claim.ADDENDUM: OF COURSE PANASONIC BLAMED ME FOR THE CAMERA HAVING CONDENSATION DAMAGE AND REFUSED TO HONOR THE WARRANTY.

Unfortunately, the image quality was mediocre at best, with soft images, lots of flare, poor color rendition, and little ability to control camera settings.  My copy also had some crazy lines going through the video.  Obviously, I may have had a faulty unit (I returned it), but you should not buy this expecting it to produce images as nice as a typical point and shoot.  It doesn't.By way of comparison, I have a Canon SX260, a Sony NEX5n, and some higher end Canon dslrs.  It's only moderately fair to compare to the SX260, which is also a small sensor point and shoot.  The Canon kills it in exposure, colors, sharpness and controls.  Obviously, it's not waterproof though.In sum, if you do get this, temper your expectations and realize you will be sacraficing some image quality for the \"rugged\" features.  In that category, it's a relative bargain, but only if you aren't expecting to make large prints and have realistic expectations about the IQ it will produce.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "failed in 13 months...1 month out of warranty", "Author": "Bobby Oberlechner", "ReviewID": "R2FUCFU5KIGT0B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I never write reviews.  I probably should because I purchase a lot of products and for the most part, they perform as advertised. However, I purchased this camera in late August of 2012 to take on a cruise.  We used it and enjoyed it for the 2 days that we were doing underwater pictures. We used it a time or two above water during the next 12 months.  We took less than 100 pictures and less than 5 minutes of video all total in a year. This year we packed it again to take on another cruise. mind you, an additional month has passed and we are in our 13th month of ownership.  On the second day, the camera fails, the screen goes white, and we have access to nothing. So when we get back, we send it in for repair. Panasonic is telling us that it is out of warranty.

Do not buy this or you will be wasting your money....yes I am upset enough to write a review...that's how bad it is.Update 10-10-13. I called 3 different numbers and emailed the main office after I sent my camera to the repair facility in McAllen Texas. All said the same thing;\"if it is out of warranty there is nothing we can do\". So I waited....I finally received an email that asked me to send it to the repair facility and NOT include all of my accessories as they have them there...so I at least got the answer to that mystery. Well today when I came home, I had received a box from the repair facility. In it was a replacement (the next newer model) camera.

At 16.1 MP, it seemed like a great small camera that would work for underwater pictures as well as pictures elsewhere out of the water. The camera comes up with a warning outlining the necessary precautions for underwater use. I had read all the prior reviews and assumed that those who were frustrated with their purchase must have neglected to follow these simple precautions. I was very wrong in this assumption!Within no more than 15 minutes of use, following all the on-camera precautions, the camera no longer worked. I could potentially have understood this if we were diving deep down in the ocean and putting a significant amount of pressure on the camera, but we never had it deeper than 3 feet in our hotel pool. After being turned off, the camera came back on but the buttons no longer worked. Then, the buttons began to work again, but moisture had already made its way into the camera and it was impossible to capture a photo and have any recognition of what the camera had taken a picture of.The description of this camera states that it is \"tough,\" but I can honestly assure you that is not the case. We have had other underwater cameras in the past, including a fujifilm underwater camera that lasted us nearly three years of great pictures under much more strenuous conditions than this camera. I will be returning this camera to Amazon and expecting a full refund as well as something to mitigate the fact that we were left with no camera in Mexico for a good portion of our trip.I know it seems easy to assume that myself and the other reviewers who had similar issues simply did not follow the precautions, but that is what I thought as well and here I am writing a similar review.

Today I received from Panasonic a replacement for the TS20 - a refurbished TS4. I haven't used the new camera yet, but from a quick Amazon search it seems a [new] TS4 costs about twice as much as a TS20 and has more features than the TS20, albeit only 12MP vs. 16MP.While Panasonic did send me a replacement camera, I can't in good conscious change the rating for the original TS20.  The fact is that the TS20 broke after only one underwater use, which is unacceptable.  However, my opinion of Panasonic and their customer service is improved after receiving a replacement camera.---Original review---Executive Summary: I do not recommend this camera to anyone attempting to use it underwater since it died on me after one use.I bought this camera ~2 weeks ago specifically for my trip to the Great Barrier Reef to take pictures underwater while snorkeling.  I also used it as my point-and-shoot camera while in Australia when it was easier/faster then using our DSLR.  Prior to being submerged in water the camera took great pictures and I was happy with it.  It focused quickly in full auto mode, and even adjusted automatically for shots of landscapes vs. plants/flowers vs. portrait.The first time I went snorkeling the camera took OK shots.  It still focused on what I wanted and the 4x optical zoom was handy since at points where we were the GBR is 10-40ft below the surface and the fish aren't always accommodating to portraits.  On review, most of the pictures turned out to be a little on the green side.  I suppose this is to be expected with underwater shots.After snorkeling the first time, I followed the instructions and rinsed the camera off with fresh water and let it sit for a little while (~1hr).  When I looked at it again, both the lens and the LCD screen were foggy, meaning any shot I took was blurred so as to be useless.  I let it sit for another ~1hr and tried again for my last snorkel of the day.  Both lens and LCD were still foggy and I was not able to take any more decent pictures.  The foggyness never did go away.When I returned to the hotel to view some shots, the camera turned on with a completely white LCD screen, followed by a couple beeps, followed by some error messages ('error: zoom'  what?).  At this point, the camera is useless. Now that I am home, the camera won't even turn on at all.  No LCD screen response, no pictures, nothing. It makes a noise like a Geiger counter sometimes, but otherwise is completely dead.Very, very unsatisfied with this purchase and am unlikely to buy a camera from Panasonic again, especially not an \"underwater\" camera.

Underwater pictures turn out surprisingly clear and normal everyday photos turn out well.Unfortunately, this camera has issues with high and low light conditions. Low light pictures look almost like they were taking with a cell phone... pretty grainy and lacking contrast. Bright light, such as the sun behind your subject, will cause your pictures to be pretty washed out.

I used it the next week on the beach, the lens fogged up after underwater use (with the water safety feature completely closed), but after a full night opened up it aired out and worked fine so I kept it. Huge Mistake! Went to use it 4months later for our 2 month honeymoon in the south pacific and the screen completely fogged up after one use outside and in the water.

Well, I was on vacation for another 7 weeks so this would not help me at all. I let it air out for a full week and luckily MOST of the fog went away and we could capture pictures. After another day of use more fog dissipated and it was almost normal. This is when the battery decided not to charge, even though the light was green. We found someone with a similar charger and it worked so luckily we could use our camera for a few more days while we were around them. Eventually the battery died and we tried recharging it at every hotel, and while the light lit up the camera wouldn't even turn on when we put it in the camera. We assumed it was the charger so I called to ask for a new one since it was obviously faulty and they would not send one unless I had the original receipt from 8 months ago.

And oh, bought an open box to reduce the price more, so may need to take my review with a grain of salt, although my experience aligns with the smaller percentage of folks with bad experiences.Research: From the reputable web sites that review cameras, there are no clear cut winners in the $300 and below water, dust, drop, etc, etc, proof cameras. There are sacrifices in design that have to be made to build a waterproof electronic camera. Your mileage is going to vary based upon expectations.  If you\u2019re a photo hobbyist, prepare for a let down.  If you like to capture picture memories, you maybe overjoyed with the results. I lean more toward good photography results.  Out of water, the camera performed as expected and was happy with the results.  Underwater, meh\u2026 But that wasn\u2019t all the camera\u2019s fault (see tips).Tips: 1) Keep your camera wrapped (insulated) in your very cold cabin.  A lens that has been cooled for hours and brought out into a warm moist tropical environment is going to fog up (just like sun glasses). It\u2019s a documented troubleshooting issue in the manual. The solution however, isn\u2019t a quick fix.  It took the camera almost three hours to unfog, making it useless for the planned activity I had for it.  2) Expect 25% to 40% of your underwater pictures to be bad and no fault of the camera.  You\u2019re snorkeling, have this mask on, getting pushed around by the current, bumping into people (most likely your spouse), trying to get that beautiful fish to stop moving and say \u201cCheese\u201d for the camera.  You\u2019re going to miss the fish!  Take three extra pictures for every scene you want to capture (law of probability means you might get a good picture out of the four you took).  Also, trying to preview your picture to see if you got the shot, bobbing up and down, in bright sunlight\u2026 not going to happen. You\u2019re not going to know if you got a good picture until you get back on the bus. Prepare for the let downs, then you\u2019ll be happy with what did turn out. 3) Buy a floating wrist strap.  It\u2019s a pain trying to get in and out of the water from a boat with a camera on your wrist.  This camera is light, with a floating wrist strap, you can throw it into the water, get in, then swim to the camera.Performance: Here\u2019s the let down of this camera, three days after the cruise (total ownership was three weeks), the camera failed.  I get \u201cSystem Error (Zoom)\u201d, which if you do a little research on the web seems to be more of a common occurrence.  Tried all troubleshooting recommendations in manual.  The other fix\u2026 a visit to the factory where it will cost almost the price of the camera to fix. If I had bought new vice an open box (where I wasn\u2019t sure if the warranty was still valid), I would have sent it in.  But there are a few horror stories of the companies saying that\u2019s not covered under warranty (dude, you\u2019re marketing as a water proof camera) to paying for postal for the repairs (why should I have to pay for your camera failing to meet expectations). A little more research shows that sand/salt can get lodged making the camera inoperable (occurs more than not), requiring troubleshooting, i.e. soaking in fresh water to hopefully fix.  Another annoyance, Panasonic recommends soaking the camera in fresh water upon returning from a sand/salt water activity to make sure that no sand/salt gets into the battery and SD card compartment, (which may be why companies invalidate warranties cause they can claim you didn\u2019t soak the camera in fresh water before opening and therefore sand/salt entered the camera).  Battery life was good, didn\u2019t have a problem keeping a charge for the entire time I used it during an activity.Recommendation: Had the camera not failed after getting home from the cruise, I would have given it 3 to 4 stars.  The camera is fine out of water, and the underwater shots have exposure issues (when you can get a good shot).

It was in/under the water for at least an hour, one or two times a day, for five straight days.I hemmed and hawed for a little over a month looking at about 10 waterproof cameras for an upcoming trip to Bermuda where I planned to do a lot of snorkeling. After considering price and knowing I had a decent back-up in case this broke (an old canon point and shoot w/underwater housing), I bit the bullet and bought this camera. Unless you really mistreat this camera, I don't understand, outside of a manufacturer defect, how it becomes un-waterproofed.I tested it first in my 75 gal fish tank, letting it sit with the float strap for 30 minutes. It turned on in the tank, took pictures of my fish, and it continued to work after it was removed. No problems!I used this for snorkeling five days in a row while in Bermuda, and one day had it 1hr45min continuously (turned on the whole time, taking pictures on and off) in the water (it says it can go up to 1 hour safely). It worked like a charm. I made sure to soak it in fresh water for 10-15 min and press all the buttons (to remove salt) when I arrived back at the vacation rental (sometimes after more than an hour), shook it out, and let it sit on a washcloth to dry (all in the directions that come with the camera). I guess I babied it a bit but maybe that's why it has worked so well?I used the underwater mode so I wouldn't have to fuss with anything and most of the pictures came out fairly well, especially with favorable water conditions (crystal clear water, lots of sunlight, not a lot of sand particles).The video function worked nicely and it was quick to switch back and forth to taking still pictures. Under water, you cannot hear the motor of the zoom and it stayed in focus pretty well, I thought. Play back seems a little weird at times (too fast?) but it's all good. The colors were nice as well.I took it snorkeling at a couple shipwrecks and dove down at least 9-10ft with it, and it continued to work at that depth and when I resurfaced.The reason for the 4 stars is mostly due to the picture quality and options of the camera's features.What I disliked:-Underwater mode uses AWB which still allows too much blue and green in most pictures, they could easily fix this without having someone make a custom white balance which would be time consuming to do while in the water.-Underwater mode only uses the \"standard\" color mode and does not allow you to choose \"vivid\" like you can in Normal mode. It seems that b/c it uses AWB and AutoISO that you could just shoot in Normal mode underwater but for some reason the pictures were worse than using the specified underwater mode... at any rate, the vast majority of the underwater pictures came out a tad underwhelming in terms of color. However, because of the 16M capability, this is pretty well remedied in post-processing (if you do that)-Most of the pictures (in normal or underwater) came out very over exposed. In post-processing, I had to bring down exposures .5-1.00 full exposure to bring colors and highlights back in check. This happened moreso when taking pictures on the beach and of landscapes, but it also occurred under water.-In EVERY panorama I took, there are several vertical sections of the overall picture where the exposure has obviously changed and you can plainly see the overlap the camera made when moving the camera side to side. You'd think in panorama mode, there would be an automatic exposure lock but that does not seem to be the case. So this aspect was disappointing.-If there was not optimal lighting and optimal water quality, picture quality seemed to drop off fairly quickly. Once the light levels went below partly sunny, the noise in the underwater photos was more noticeable. I was not able to test this on land since I didn't really take any pictures outside of bright sunlight.-Burst mode (high quality, 16M) was lackluster... it was too slow to even be helpful.I will post my unprocessed pictures so people can see the sometimes lackluster color and overexposure, but also the great underwater capabilities without buying several thousand dollar professional equipment.Overall, if you take care of your equipment and need a fairly priced underwater camera, I would absolutely recommend this product. Just make sure you buy it pretty soon before you need it. That way, if it doesn't work, you will still be covered with the return policy from wherever you bought the camera. (This camera was $150 at Target when I bought it, they also have a 30-day return policy). If you post-process your images, the 16M allows a good amount of flexibility to add some more saturation and alter exposure without suffering too much in image quality.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera but it leaks.", "Author": "Agapemou", "ReviewID": "R3UI76E1TBRYCM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera took great pictures in the water.

I could have bought a cheapie for him, but I wanted a good, sturdy camera that could grow with him until he's an adult and can upgrade, knowing more about what he wants.  I researched cameras on Consumer Reports, etc.  I could not find the top rated camera for sale anywhere.  Then I looked at the waterproof ratings, and found this one.  I definitely wanted something sturdy, since Victor is still a kid and would probably be bouncing it around on his trip along with other places he'd take it.  I am concerned about the \"waterproof\" reference, since in reading the reviews I found that most people found it wasn't really waterproof.  I told Victor to never actually take it under water because of the ratings, but I was pleased that it would probably be OK in rain or water fountain sprays.  I also liked the lens set up because an extendable lens might get caught on things or open accidentally.  This again makes the camera more likely to hold up to the uses he'll give it.When he opened it on Christmas, I had charged the battery (easy to do) and also loaded an SD card (none came with the camera).  So, it was ready for use.  He seemed thrilled - he loved the orange color, tho' I had been a bit worried about that.  He knew enough about digital cameras from watching & occasionally using his parents' camera that he began taking pix right away.  He's a tinkerer, and was able to figure out how things worked pretty quickly.  I was a bit disappointed that the various buttons didn't stick up higher, and so were hard to \"feel\" and use without looking - that slows you down when you're taking lots of pictures, but that also means they don't stick up to catch on things that might damage the camera.  I even added a tiny book about digital cameras for dummies, and we found out his school has a camera club, so he should be a pro by the time the trip comes around.  His sister was jealous (maybe next year?), and my only disappointment was when I saw an ad at a local store 2 weeks before Christmas for the same camera, but $20 less!", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Daylight only", "Author": "Mark B.", "ReviewID": "R8BCS965Q7K4A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I used this in a pool and on the beach and it takes great pictures during the day.

The return process was easy, and the customer service was excellent.  So, if you should buy this camera and something is wrong, in my experience the company will make it right.  Therefore, I am upgrading my review from 1 star to 3 stars, and may move it to 4 stars once I try the new camera underwater.------- Original review below -----I was very careful to follow all the directions, and looked forward to some great underwater photos during a recent cruise to the Caribbean.  Sadly, the LCD screen on the back of the camera became damaged after only 20 minutes in the water. Because I could still see ghosts of images on the screen, I kept taking photos hoping that they would turn out. When we got back to the room, I rinsed the camera thoroughly in fresh water and hoped it would dry.By the second day, the \"ghosted\" screen began flashing off and on (like an electrical short), and the camera would take a photo only when the screen was on. However, with no other alternative, (and nothing to lose at this point) I just pointed the camera in the direction I wanted and clicked blindly, hoping that I would end up with a couple of usable images.When I got home and loaded the SD card, I was happily shocked to discover that the damage seemed to be completely limited the LCD screen.  The images themselves turned out far better than I expected - particularly since I was unable to see anything I was shooting. The flash and autofocus seemed to work fine, and the color/contrast on the images was quite acceptable for vacation photos.But without that LCD screen, the camera is basically useless -- you can't see what you are shooting without it. Because I ordered the camera from Amazon on Oct 25th rather than November 1st, I am ineligible for the extended holiday return period (next year I will delay any Q4 Amazon purchase til Nov 1st) and will have to contact the manufacturer to see if a warranty replacement is available.  To be honest, I'm not expecting much help from them, and I assuming that I've simply thrown away $180 -- but at least I managed to get a few vacation images.

I give it a 5 out of 5 in this area. I've only used mine in pools and water parks, so I don't know how the clarity will differ in lakes, oceans, etc. but I get several compliments on my underwater photos. The camera is also super easy to use in water and drying it just means placng it on a towel to drip dry on its own (for pool use). If your main purpose is an underwater camera, I highly recommend this one, but if you want a multipurpose camera, this may not be it.Cons:For regular pictures, the quality is a bit grainy. I've been trying several different settings and the biggest thing I am noticing in general with this camera is grainness. With the underwater pics, it's a little harder to notice, but it is definitely noticble in regular photos, especially in darker settings. However, even inside a house during the day, the photos still look a little grainy/blurry at times. It works fine outside in good lighting, but I'd say for standard use picture taking, quality is about a 3.So overall, I gave this a 4.

I took a waterproof disposable last year to Warrior Dash, and it worked out fine, but the problem with the old school wind-up cameras, if you accidentally hit the picture button, there goes a waste of one photo gone of your hand or blurry shirt or whatever!So I decided to invest in a digital waterproof camera. I already have an AWESOME Canon for my regular everyday and special events, so I didn't want to spend so much on a camera that I would only use for my obstacle marathons and beach/pool-side outings.After reading up on a few on the lower costs models (I really wanted the waterproof Canon, but just couldn't pay that price!), it came down to the Waterproof Kodak Easyshare and the Waterproof Panasonic Lumix. Both had decent Pros and Cons Feedback. I opted for the Lumix because come down to it...I just didn't want to deal with carrying AA batteries. REALLY?!...batteries! I'm all about the lithium rechargeable batteries.I took the camera to a pool party this past weekend, and was a little hesitant to dip the camera and take under water shots, but hey...that's why I bought it...to test it out! So I did it....and the camera worked out GREAT! The under water shots of the kids were awesome! I thought there would be water spots when taking photos in the pool (splashing kids), but none! The battery and card section is sealed tight! I made sure to keep it locked and let the camera dry off before opening it to retrieve the memory card.I tried out the video, and the videos came out clear and fine.Now there are some feedbacks on this camera about the quality of the photos. Honestly....the photos were nice and clear. Not great like my non-waterproof Canon, but I bought it for the ruggedness and waterproof ability; to be able to not worry about dropping it in the pool or kids splashing nearby.There are also feedbacks here that state their camera isn't waterproof. I think that those individuals may have received a defect that may have came off the production line. But those are few here and there that comes out defective straight out of the warehouse.This being my first time use of it, I definitely LOVE the camera!

EVERYTHING PROOF!!!So I just came back and survived Tough Mudder! This little camera is ALL AROUND TOUGH!!!! I honestly thought that at one point mud would seep through. But I waded through mud, jumped into muddy waters, swam through even more gross water, and the camera kept turning on every time I took it out of my Spi-belt to take photos. I do have to say that some photos came out smudgy only because it was hard to clear out the lens from all the mud and I was so dirty and muddy that wiping it off on me wasn't helping. Plus it was sometimes hard to see on the picture viewer only because of the mud. But the point of this all, is that the camera took pictures way better than a disposable could ever, and I was able to take video also! AND it survived TOUGH MUDDER!! Now if you don't know what event I'm talking about, look it up! When you do check it out, you'll probably think, \"yeah right!\" But believe me...this camera is TOUGHER and more rugged than it looks!

The main reason i bought it was because i would be in the water most of the time, and I did not want to worry about getting the camera wet. I pretty much kept the camera in the water the entire time; it was in my pocket while i was in the pool. Most of the reviews I read seemed to complain about the camera breaking after a few days. I read the instructions and cleaned it each night to ensure it did not get any sand in the battery opening; this would cause water to get in the camera. After the 4th day the camera's screen got a little foggy, but it usually disappeared within seconds of being outside the water.Pros:Descent picture qualityWaterproofGreat extra features: Panoramic, Tilt shift (miniature), and other basic settings.Re-chargeable batteryLong battery lifeGood price $160Cons:A little bulkier than a regular digital cameraIf there are any other issues i will update this review.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still working great after 2 years", "Author": "R.

The photos enlarge well and no one can believe they are from my little small Lumix pocket camera. I recently took it to Saint Lucia for two weeks, instead of my larger cameras. ALL the photos turned out so nice, I put together a very nice picture book from one of the man sources on line. It looks like I went to a bookstore and purchased it, as one friend said when she saw it. YOU WILL LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CAMERA and it WORKS SO WELL. Has several setting and during this trip, I took many pictures from our moving car-all turned out great. I have taken it to the beach, on out boat, used it on cloudy days, in the rain, in bright light, in sunlight and at night-all turned out nice.

You'll come back from your adventure and be thoroughly disappointed with those pictures, though. To give you an idea, they are much worse than any smartphone cameras of today, about as good as a decent digital camera from 2002, and way worse than a GoPro 3.I took it whitewater kayaking in Pennsylvania, and would rather use screen grabs from the GoPro footage, than the photos from this camera. I am a hobbyist photographer, and use a GoPro 3+, a Nikon P7100 with a dive rated housing, and a Nikon D7000.I thought this camera would work great to carry along in my pocket and take slightly zoomed in pictures of kayakers surfing, since the GoPro is too wide. Turns out the quality is so bad that I wouldn't even want to show anyone those pictures: the beauty of the scene just wasn't captured. Panasonic really needs to up their game. I understand that this class of cameras is not supposed to take GREAT pictures, but they need to be acceptable at least.

I've used it in the swimming pool and on rainy days and taken it camping  I've dropped it with no damage.  It takes excellent pictures and 720 p video.  It has a variety of nice shooting modes including \"Happy\" which produces richer colors without being over the top.  It shoots a variety of aspect ratios for still pictures, the full range from 16:9 to 1:1.  I liked to shoot square images sometimes because it hearkens back to my first camera, a Kodak Brownie which shot medium format square photos--and is already popular for retro look applications like Instagram on your tablet or smart phone.  It is Eye-Fi compatible, so one can offload pictures without removing the card or using a cable.  It also has a fun auto panorama mode which allows you to create panoramas in camera by panning the camera.  it also takes good underwater pictures and has a greater depth rating than some of it's competitors for the same price point.  It's high megapixel count makes it possible to create high quality large prints or have more latitude for cropping out unwanted areas.What I don't like:  muddly looking view finer that's difficult to see in bright light and no optical viewfinder to offset that.  Secondly some of the paint has worn off the silver handgrip--which is made of plastic.  The third thing is that battery life is middling.  It takes a small proprietary battery.All in all a good 2nd camera for the money for when you don't want to take your more expensive camera out in all sorts of weather.  I got it at a good price.  My recommendation is to have a spare battery and make sure you have a full charge if you're going to a wet environment.  If you need to change the camera's battery out when in the field make sure it's dry, your hands are dry,  and there is no sand anywhere before opening the battery compartment as it could cause damage to your camera.

The camera leaked the first time it was used underwater (after having testing it at home in the sink).  I followed the directions precisely,  brushing the flimsy silicon seal on the inside of the locking mechanism indoors using the provided cleaning brush and checking for any sand, dirt or debris that may have come in contact with the seal.  Once I was sure that nothing was on or near the seal I closed the compartment and made sure it was locked.  When you turn the camera on and select the underwater mode it reminds you to make sure it is clean and locked and to only use it at the proper depth, all of which I did prior to heading to the beach per the directions in the users manual.After coming home and placing the still locked camera in a bowl of clean water to clean the salt off per directions, letting it air dry for several hours I opened the camera and noticed water inside the SD card slot and around the battery.  Dismayed, I let the camera dry for two days with the door open and the battery and sd card removed (the photos were fine).  Once I replaced the card and battery and tried to turn the camera on it would no longer write to the SD card.  Since this was the only camera I brought with me for my two month trip, I let it dry out some more in the hopes it would work.  After a week of drying it began to write on the SD card about 70% of the time.  This was at least an improvement but  still meant that I had a brand new camera that did not function properly and no way of replacing or repairing it until I returned home.  I was able to take non underwater photos of my trip but decided to save using it for underwater photography until the end of the trip when I'd be going to the best snorkeling site.I was able to use the camera underwater again by purchasing a plastic case for it while on the island which completely negates the reason to purchase this camera in the first place.  I could have simply bought a better point and shoot for the same amount of money and bought the casing.  The reason I did not due this is because most casing in my price point effect picture quality so I went with underwater camera that I thought would at least work for more than one day.Unfortunately I bought this at Target and the 30 day return policy has expired since I was in Saipan for nine weeks.  I am going to try and contact the company for a return or replacement (perhaps I just unlucky and bought a lemon) but I won't  be able to get back the missed opportunities that the failure of the underwater feature of this product created.My suggestion is to not purchase this camera for underwater photography, save your money and buy one with a better seal and locking mechanism.

My best friend recommended I check out this camera.  It had all the main features I was looking for and mainly the high quality 16 MP pictures.  I noticed mixed reviews, but after I compared the features and saw the price was very reasonable I decided to go for it.I have used the camera on a few trips outdoors and liked the picture quality.  The first time I had it out a friend was taking a picture of me and dropped the camera on a rock and into a mud puddle-that's one way to test it.  It seemed fine and had no issues.  I was a bit concerned about the waterproof feature after reading other reviews, but my friend with the same camera thoroughly used it underwater and assured me there were no problems.  So I took the camera with me on a cruise and used it for its intended purposes-I took it snorkeling.  Well, of course it leaked.  I  didn't notice until the evening when I took it out to take some shots and the screen looked funny, like there was too much light and the top of the screen was all bright.  The picture feature menu was all whited out and hard to see.  I opened up the battery door and sure enough the battery terminals were wet and there was some water inside.  Now before you say \"oh this guy probably didn't use it right\", let me assure you I followed the instructions to a tee.  I made sure the door was closed and locked, no debris in the seal, only had the camera submerged for less than probably 45 mins, and washed it thoroughly when done.  I never hit it on anything and was pretty careful with it.This was the first time I had used a camera like this and was a little skeptical in the first place.  Now the camera still worked and functioned good, it was just the screen that was messed up.  I continued to use it hoping the pics would turn out OK.  The next day the lens was fogged up and the screen was still too bright and looked like it had a fog layer as well.  This eventually cleared up and so did the brightness of the screen.  The pics turned out good except for a few when the lens was real foggy.  I was gonna send it in to Panasonic for warranty service, but it seems to be OK for now.  I'm just going to continue using it and see if there are any other issues seeing as I still have 7 months on the warranty.  I won't be taking it underwater again which isn't too big of a deal for me.Summary:Pro'sGood pic quality for a small handheld (16 MP)Great featuresDecent video (720P)Good soundVery compactVery reasonable priceFast turn on speedSeparate button for videoConsNot really waterproofNot HD1080 video (the one main feature I wish it had)Overall I would recommend at this point if you don't intend on getting it wet which I think some people may think that makes it kind of pointless to have a \"waterproof\" camera and not get it wet.I'll update the review if I have any more issues or end up needing to send it back.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Real Disappointment", "Author": "Joseph Kolupke", "ReviewID": "R25O5Z6XWYNS0M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife's birthday in January.

But for only 3 times...", "Author": "Aija", "ReviewID": "R2OH9ICZPWP4VU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this camera because I was moving to Hawaii and figured I'd see lots of sea critters that I'd want to take pictures of. First time I used it was just to dip it into the water (about 2-3 inches under the surface) to take pictures of some sea turtles that were insanely close by, and WOW! The pictures turned out AWESOME! I was super stoked that I bought this camera.Then I used it again, had it a little deeper in the water this time (about four feet below the surface). I used it in the water for about a half hour, pictures turned out okay, but the water had a bit of current to it so it wasn't as clear as the last place I was at. Btw, this camera is not great at \"above water\" pictures. They always turned out really washed out and cruddy, but I was always excited about the underwater quality (cameras can not be blamed for currents stirring up sand and muck in the water). Then again, I'm no expert on cameras, but I couldn't seem to figure out how to get the non-water pictures to turn out good.ANYWAY! Then my third time using the camera I was again, in the water, camera was, at most, 4ft down in the water, used it for about 15 minutes, even got some video this time which was super awesome and exciting and then suddenly, out of nowhere, all the buttons stopped working. Not a single button other than, oddly enough, the power button, worked. Just out of the blue, they all stopped, and haven't gotten them to work since. I've soaked the camera in fresh water, cleaned it out, dried it out for weeks, nothing. It turns on and off, but can't do anything other than that. So I went back, read the one-star reviews and it seems like most people had the same problem with the buttons stopping working after 2-3 underwater uses. So, I guess that's that. $120 gives you about 2-3 underwater photo shoot fun times, and that's it. It's a real bummer too because I really loved this camera before it stopped working. ALTHOUGH, I did notice that each of those times I used it under water, no matter how clean the rubber was, or how tightly the latch was closed, there'd always be a tiny bit of water all over the inside of the door that goes to the battery and memory card. That always made me nervous.Very disappointed. I really did love this camera. It just didn't last nearly as long as I'd hoped (obviously. Who'd fork out $120 for a camera that's only going to work three times?!).

I sent it back. They told me they could send me a new one in red. I preferred blue to avoid the possibility of scaring fish with a bright red camera and told them I could wait for a blue one. Instead, they repaired the camera we sent in despite my assertion that I would never trust this camera again.Whatever. Now I have it back. If I do decide to try it again, I'll make sure not to have a particularly expensive flash card and not to be too upset when (I mean if) it dies again.

I was amazed at the small size, intuitive nature of the controls and quality of the pictures right from the get go. Because of the reviews, I took the warnings about reading all instructions and followed them to the letter from the moment I took the camera out of the packaging. Our first foray foray into the water (pool) went off without a hitch. Great images, easy to use event the zoom was easy underwater. I took movies and about 50 pictures and saw nothing to concern me.On day two, I noted moisture in the view finder. I ignored it per the instructions and the moisture faded away after the morning. After letting the camera dry out on a towel for several hours, I wiped it down again and then brushed around the opening to confirm no particles. When I opened the battery door, I noted two rivulets of water in the seal track. This would appear to be water that was still pulled in when the door was open. The rivulets were tiny, but still of concern.I love the camera and have not had any issues, but I will be testing it further over the next week.

It worked great for traveling due to its small size and light weight, which allowed me to carry it in a pocket of my shorts without even knowing it was there. I actually forgot I had it in my pocket a couple times and used my phones camera instead. It appears to be very durable so far as I bumped it around quite a bit and had it in salt water while we snorkeled and then stowed it with wet, sandy gear on the boat and it held up just fine. The rechargeable battery pack stayed charged for a few days, about 160 pictures, and the camera being left on for sometimes as long as a half an hour at a time. No disappointment there at all. The overall picture quality is not quite as good as my wife's camera, which costs about the same but is not waterproof and slightly bigger. I expect that is due to the relatively small size of the lens on this camera. I did forget to change the setting for underwater pictures so most of them came out with a bluish tint. I also figured out that changing the settings to match the scene is more crucial with this camera than some others and results in a better quality picture than leaving the camera on auto. There are several options. The image stabilization doesn't work quite as well as a couple other cameras we have had, but again it seems to be helped by using a different mode setting rather than auto. Guess the key here is that auto setting is kind of limited. I have had it about 3 months now and overall I am very pleased with it for what I am using it for, really nice snapshots of vacation and day trip traveling from a camera you can actually fit in your pocket without feeling like you have 2 rolls of quarters in there.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product !", "Author": "Zaraguate", "ReviewID": "RRXFUKMSHIQ0S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used during the holidays dry/wet and just perfect, the quality of the underwater pictures are fantastic.

We are an active tropical family and love the rainforest and the ocean.  We surf, snorkel, kayak, hike in the rainforest (sometimes it's raining - imagine that) and play in the river.  My 13 year old grandson wanted a camera for his birthday so I got him this one.  We all avoided taking our cameras with us on many of our adventures (after a few casualties) so I bought him this one in hopes of being able to record more of our fun.  The first day we opened it, my grandson used it to create a claymation video.  He got modeling clay all over the camera, in the grooves, etc. and we were worried that he had already ruined it.  No problem, it cleaned right up for our trip to the beach where we took it into the ocean for surfing pictures.  We took underwater pics and pics from the surfboard.  The camera stood up well to quite a beating in the salty surf.  The pictures turned out well and the camera is no worse for wear. My grandson left it out on the porch one night and it rained through the night.  He has had it in the ocean and on the sandy beach.  Each time, it cleaned up easily following the instructions provided.  This is a tough little camera that has so far been able to take whatever we dished out.  He also got a floating wrist strap for it so if he accidentally drops it in the water it will float.  That's working well, too.  He loves his camera and it has become the family's camera of choice for all our adventures.In addition to all that, I got it at a great price.

Then it came to Nikon (with GPS feature, the only provider for that), Fuji (claimed to shoot a clear picture underwater and having colorful and chic look), and Panasonic (with common features but very cheaper than the other two).Later I found out from many reviews that you could still have a problem of water leaking  into any camera if you didn't follow the instruction strictly. Then I decided to buy Panasonic Lumix because it was cheaper and it shouldn't be that bad.Then surprisingly, in my first trip to snorkeling in Hawaii, I took the pictures with this camera. And the pictures underwater turned out to be great and clear! Better than I had expected. The key is you need to take your camera close enough to what you want to shoot on. For example if you want to make a headshot of yourself underwater, make you it's close enough to your armlength. If you want to take a picture of a fish and coral, make sure it's not far than 2-3 feet. Also I guess the sun on that day might help too. Because I went snorkeling at noon.Then I went home and cleaning this machine in room-temperature fresh water as directed in the instruction then left it to dry. Then I opened it, using the brush given to make sure there was no sand or anything in the battery slot, removed the battery, recharing it and put it back. Then I could turn it on without any problem. You just need to make sure also when using it underwater, the lock button is still locked well. Then it shouldn't be any problem.

I had Pentax waterproof cameras for 5+ years without an issue. This camera had water inside the battery/memory card area during use which shorted it out. The photos also were not clear when used before testing in water. I am not sure why this camera was rated so highly. Our Pentax (older model) took much better video and photos with a much wider angle lens and superior zoom.UPDATED: I ended up mailing the camera back (at my expense). To my surprise, Panasonic mailed me back the TS4 camera. This camera is about double the cost of the camera I returned. I was pleasantly surprised, but still a bit concerned about it being waterproof. Thankfully, the new camera hasn't had any problems so far. The TS4 seems to be made better overall.

As a minor concern, some of the buttons' names are wearing off after only 2 months use, but through plenty of wet usage.  Another complaint is that every time the camera turns on, a screen asks if you want to review the waterproof guidelines.  One touch of a button gets rid of this screen, but it is a bit annoying nonetheless.Overall, I think this camera is the best buy for anything in its class, there are no major concerns and I couldn't be happier!", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "My TS20 is great, but its blue color gets me as many compliments as my photos!", "Author": "QuintBy", "ReviewID": "R3IKYSYFQ7Y5RR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my TS20, which I bought brand new at $20 off even though it was listed under the \"Refurbished\" category.

Followed the instructions to soak in fresh water for 10 minutes after usage and the camera was good the next day. The battery last a whole day fully charged which I LOVE since its rechargable!Con: There's no view finder on this camera so you have to be careful not sticking your finger in front of the lens. While using the camera near water or out of the water, you have to make sure that you wipe the lens because if you don't then you will have a water drop in your photos.Overall I love this camera and it's my to go to camera now!

The idea was to have as easily accessible camera to use while hiking and kayaking. I am far from a professional photographer but I was very disappointed in the picture quality. Why cameras with viewfinders are going the way of the woolly mammoth, I'll never know. The grainy LCD viewfinder was difficult to see in the sunlight both to frame your picture and then to see what the picture you took looked like. Still, I could live that. However, this is supposed to be a point and shoot camera, none of the settings on the camera resulted in good picture quality. After using the camera to take a few hundred pictures and finding myself disappointed when I uploaded the pictures to my computer, I decided to return the camera. It's not good when your phone takes better pictures than a device that is specifically made to take pictures. I'll keep looking and likely go to a Canon product; I've been happy with my old, bulky AE 80 Powershot so hopefully I will find a Canon compact camera that fits the bill.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great value", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R28IN4Z091OAHC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a 3-day canoe trip, and it worked like a champ!

the reflection of the sun from the water or you look at the sun directly, I see green vertical bars on the LCD and resulting picture/video.  I uploaded a sample video from the camera to this review.(please leave a comment or write a review stating whether or not your camera has this same issue)I've tried resetting the camera to make sure it wasn't a bad setting by me, but it still does it.Wondering if anyone else has this issue... if not, I'll look at exchanging it for another one.But again... for the price (and even with the issue described above), fun camera :)(Note: Normally I'd just exchange the product and try again in this kind of scenario, but Best Buy (where I got the camera) is currently out of stock both in store and online... so, all I can do there is return the camera.  If it's an issue with all DMC-TS20 cameras, I'll keep mine.

I brought it with me on a trip to Mexico, where I had anticipated taking a lot of underwater photos of fish and things.  Spent most of the time on the beach, however, and not snorkeling or anything.  I did take a few underwater photos, but the water was too murky to really see anything too well (this was around the time of the hurricane in August 2012).  The pictures were often a little overexposed, I thought, in beach mode, and nighttime mode wasn't my favorite, but in general my photos were good.When I first tested the camera, it was in the resort pool.  I did look at the rubber piece that keeps it waterproof, and used the brush to wipe away some lint that I noticed on a very close inspection.  It's annoying, yes, but it's worth taking care of if you are planning on using it for water photos or near water.You do need to be very very particular with this camera; I also noticed that some of my photos came out with a \"blob\" on the picture where there was a water droplet left on the lens.Overall, it's a decent camera, and I will be using it as my main digital camera from now on.

I don't mind; this is a point shoot camera and the dials would compromise the weather seals.- Weather sealing seems okay, but again I've not used it underwater yet.- Exposure compensation is available and it's worth underexposing (-1/3 to -2/3rds) sensor in bright light.- Macro range is not great - 5 cm (1.97\"), but with the 16MP sensor you can crop and still get huge images.- Flash range is 4.4 meters.More specs are listed on DPreview.com, but they are not complete for all features (They don't list the Underwater mode.)[...]", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "For lumix TS20", "Author": "Temma Deguchi", "ReviewID": "R1XBT8XGBMOASS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Best fit for panasonic TS20.But it is not good design to hold snap.too easy open and afraid of dropping camera.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Durable", "Author": "Krissy", "ReviewID": "R9SG3VG8298JE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera for a young man.
