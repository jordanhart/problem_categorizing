{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing software and firmware, a great buy.....", "Author": "jd", "ReviewID": "R33IE18NEHGKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started with a Swann DVR, then later a Zmodo DVR - gave up on them (both failed within 1 year).  This one blows them all away.  Great features that allow many ways to set up your system to do what you need it to do.  Motion detect works well, dual streams (with different quality) for normal record, alarm input, and motion detect modes.  Sub stream to view many cameras over the internet at a lower resolution.  Ability to take snapshots and send to a network drive as a backup data location.  Very configurable to do what you want.  Great customer service for technical help.  You can select 1 channel to email you or trigger many cameras to record (at higher resolution) and it records all video at a lower bit rate until motion or alarm is detected and it jumps up to higher quality..... All configurable.  Professional Security System software is truly professional grade software to do what you need it to do, easier to find motion footage or events on while viewing multiple cameras.  Buy it!  -  you will love the features and have the freedom to configure as you need it to function in your situation.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "NICE DVR But no mobile or mac support", "Author": "T.
