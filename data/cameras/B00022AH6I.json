{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Quality and Price!", "Author": "Q", "ReviewID": "R1CK8LROQ21INB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second digital camera, so I shopped around very carefully and chose this one. I haven't been disappointed.One thing I really like is that it is relatively easy to hold and handle--not like some of those super compact cameras that are so popular now. The DX7440 has a nice hand grip, and the controls are all very accessible.This camera is also very FAST. Many digital camera have an awkward shutter lag. This camera focuses very very fast, and there is no discernible shutter lag. Look at the specifications and compare to other cameras!The \"automatic\" picture-taking setting work great with no worries and excellent quality, but if you're ambitious, there are lots of manual controls available like aperture priority and shutter priority and etc.The zoom lens is wonderful; 4x is better than the 3x on most cameras in this price range, and it zooms in very fast and smooth. 4x zoom is actually more powerful than the more expensive Kodak DX7630, with 3x zoom.4 megapixels allows plenty of room for cropping your shots and still retaining good quality.I just got a set of photos back from Winkflash, an on-line photo lab, and the picture quality is excellent for 4x6 snapshots.Battery life is quite good. I went for a 4-day camping trip and filled up an entire 512 mb memory card without running out of juice. That's with the supplied battery, and a longer-lasting one is available for $24 on Amazon.The extra-large LCD screen is also much better than most of the competition, and can be viewed even in bright sunlight.On a Macintosh, you do not have to use the Kodak software. The camera interfaces fine with mac's Iphoto software. The Mac X image capture software allows for downloading movies.You can shoot movies in 640 by 480, double the resolution of most cameras.I bought a 32x high speed 512 mb Lexar Sd card, which works fine--although apparently there is only a minimal advantage to a high-speed card, and Kodak does not recommend them.For a camera case, I highly recommend the Lowepro D-Res 10AW. The DX74440 fits PERFECTLY, with room for a battery and spare memory card. The case is well-designed, well-padded, and compact.For the range of features, ease of use, and price, the DX7440 can't be beat!", "Date": "August 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "I like Kodak cameras so much I just bought Kodak stock", "Author": "Chris Rachael Oseland", "ReviewID": "R3FTXTUXSMB1QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not joking about the stock. This is my second Kodak EasyShare camera. My first was a basic EasyShare CX4310, which is a sturdy digital point-and-shoot. After a year of digital photography, I wanted two things in an upgrade: zoom, which is easy to find, and fast shutter speed, which is not.Most digital cameras have significant shutter lag. You press the button and tell people to just keep smiling, really. By the time you get the shot, they've started looking elsewhere or the smiles have faded into irritation or the photo is just a blur of movement. I went to several local electronics stores and experimented with display models (often putting in my own media card so I could examine the photos later) before making a final decision.There are plenty of cameras with more megapixels, but I feel comfortable in saying NONE below $900 with a comperable shutter speed. I didn't want a digital SLR. If you whip out a huge camera at parties, people flinch. I wanted something both fast and discreet, something I could carry in my pocket and whip out the second anything intersting happened without having to stage a shot.The Kodak EasyShare DX7440 lives up to all my expectations. If it did nothing more than take fast, clear photos, I would be thrilled, but it is loaded with other features I appriciate.PROS:* The 16 built in presets work beautifully. I've been very pleased with the results ranging from \"Sports\" to \"Self Portrait.\"* If you don't like their presets, you can make your own settings very easily.* This camera is great for a whole family. Point and shoot people can just leave it on \"auto.\" More advanced photographers can set fstop and aperature settings manually. I particularly appriciate that Kodak made seperate controls for the dummy and pro settings. A little wheel in the upper right corner controls manual settings, so if your point-and-shoot spouse picks up the camera, they don't lose your settings OR take lousy pictures and wonder why you broke the camera.* The preview screen on back is HUGE, making it very easy to frame shots.* You can change aspect ratios on the camera itself, so instead of shooting at 4x5 (equilivent of an 8x10 photo) you can set it to shoot at 2x3 (equilivent of a 4x6 photo). This means less cropping and photo editing later. This feature is espically nice if you have a printer dock and want to print straight from your camera.* The video feature works shockingly well. Set it to video, press the button once, and it will film until you fill up your memory card or you press the same button, telling it to stop. You don't have to hold down the shutter the whole time, which is a major bonus. The video quality is about average, with surprisingly good sound pickup. The ability to simply plug the camera into a TV using standard cables is *wonderful.* I never thought I'd want something like this, but now I'll be disapointed if I ever lose it.* Burst mode works very well.* Zoom is smooth and fast. You can set it to either flow organically or to hop to 1x, 2x, etc.* The interface software is hands-down the best in the business. You don't have to \"learn\" a Kodak camera. They are very intuitively designed. Other manufacturers could learn something from studying their interface.CONS:* The presets are easy to access, but just as easy to accidentally switch while in the process of taking a photo. Several pictures intended for party mode have ended up in \"Night Landscape.\" They were partially salvagable with color correction software, but still pretty unsatisfactory.* The camera loses the time and date settings every time you remove the battery. If you have a charging dock, this probably isn't an issue, but for those of us who charge the battery seperately, it gets annoying very fast.* Like most digital cameras, people complain about the brightness of the flash. As a photographer, I'd say they use just enough, but as a subject, it can be painfully blinding. This is all the more reason to take action shots rather than lining people up for posed photos.All in all, I love this camera and expect to use it for years to come. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality pocket sized digital camera.", "Date": "November 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "The best camera!", "Author": "MM", "ReviewID": "R3V9FRC11ZHC7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the best!  I upgraded from a 3-yr-old Olympus 3MP/2X zoom to this 4MP/4X zoom, but the best thing about the upgrade is how fast it is.  It has an internal memory that is used as a temporary hard drive, and taking pictures is instantaneous.  I think the specs on Kodak.com say it takes 0.2 seconds to take picture after picture (to up to about 6 or so pics in a row manually), and only 1.2 seconds from turning the camera on to taking a picture.  I can vouch for that personally.  You can literally circle the room, taking pictures like a gunslinger.Don't let the \"Professional\" grade scare you off.  Just put it on auto and go.  If you want fine tune your pics, it has 16 modes you can use, like sand, night landscape, night portrait, etc.It also uses a lithium ion battery, similar to what camcorders use.  It even comes with its own charger.  I know you might prefer AA rechargable types, but lithium ion lasts a lot longer.  And besides, if you don't use the viewfinder to take pictures (since it's unnecessary) your battery will literally last months between charges.  So if you are going on vacation, just charge it up before you go.  No worries.If you are thinking about getting the 5MP/3X Zoom that Kodak also sells, which I was also considering, then realize that a zoom level is equal to about a MP.  4MP by itself is plenty, unless you're making posters, and the extra zoom lets you focus on what you want, and helps to eliminate cropping later.The USB plug & software works like a charm.  Even if you don't use the software, my Windows XP automatically recognizes the camera as another hard drive, in my case, the \"J\" hard drive.  Then just cut and paste.  Some people might complain about the low budget photo editing software, which lets you get rid of red-eye, and do some cropping, and that's about it, but if you want something fancy, then go out and get some $50 software that will do everything.  Don't let that keep you from getting this camera.  The charger that comes included is worth $50 by itself.The camera looks bigger based on its pics, but it's actually quite small and light, and will easily fit in a pants pocket.The bottom line is there is nothing I would change about this camera.  Every time I use it I literally say, \"I love this camera.\"  I was very pleased with the photo quality from my old Olympus, but I'm a die-hard Kodak user now.  Don't forget about how fast it is!  Nothing's more frustrating than missing out on a great picture because your camera's too slow.", "Date": "September 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great features - Easy to Use!!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2HDJC7QW2FJF8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kodak DX7440 is a near perfect combination of features and ease of use.  The 2.2\" viewfinder is great for framing shots both inside and outside and the 4x zoom gets you a little closer than most cameras in its class.  The ergonomics of the camera are also a plus.  It fits comfortably in my hand and the dial and joystick are very easy to use.  The Kodak DX7440 produces vivid colors that other digital cameras just can't match and the images are much sharper than the Canon I previously owned.For the beginner photographer, it has a full auto mode and a number of special scene modes to help take great pictures.  For the intermediate photographer, it has PASM modes which give you even more creative control.  The movie mode is better than most cameras, but if you really want to make movies, you should probably get a camcorder.I have only 2 complaints about the DX7440 - the lack of a superfine compression mode and the use of a proprietary battery.  However, neither of these issues are too big of a deal.  Hopefully Kodak will release a firmware update at some point in the future to address the superfine compression.  I ended up buying 2 backup Li-Ion batteries so that should not be an issue in the future.In conclusion, I would recommend this camera to any beginner or intermediate photographer who wants a camera that is simple and fun to use.", "Date": "July 10, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great, great camera!", "Author": "Kelly", "ReviewID": "R2W59AVATNX7UJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this as my second camera in a rush because my HP \"fell ill\" after 3 years (that was a good camera also). I could've never made a better choice. I have so much creative control with the focus, zoom, color, lighting and all other choices that I had never had before. This camera gives you the ability to be as artistic in your photos as you want. The photos come out clear and big and as someone said in a previous review, their original resolution gives you a large enough size to work with. The 16 set scenes give you even more creative control, there is one for anything you dream of taking pictures of.The software is easy to install and transfer is very simple. I had the box open, battery in and had taken the first few pictures all within 5 minutes of buying it. Battery life is about 45 minutes before you need to recharge (takes about 3 hours or less depending on how much you want it charged). This camera even gives you a snapshot sound (which you can change to music) each time you turn it on or take a picture. The pictures take incredibly fast. You can literally shoot in the moment, not 2 seconds from the moment. The 2.2 inch screen is also a good size to work with. I've found no problems with it at all.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone, beginners and intermediates alike. It will put the life into your photography. You'll never want to stop taking pictures! For the price and the artistic freedom, this would be your best choice, you won't regret it!", "Date": "September 13, 2004"}, {"Title": "My favorite digicam!", "Author": "Camera addict \"Love it!\"", "ReviewID": "RVN4RJTG1TKGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned many digicams, and this one is the best! I've had Olympus, Canon, Toshiba, and Sony cameras... this is the first one I've LOVED both the camera and the capability! I've even downgraded from my 5 MP camera for the shutter speed and better zoom.Pros: The shutter is very fast, MUCH faster than any previous camera. It turns on quickly, and shoots fast. The pictures are great 95% of the time (not in love with the macro mode, though). There are many different scene presets, like museum (where the sound and flash are turned off), Party (red-eye reduction on), etc, etc. There are on screen prompts that tell you when you might want to use each mode. VERY VERY user friendly. It has a neat \"favorites\" mode, that saves a smaller copy of favorite pics on the camera so you can use it as a sort of album, one touch easy. Very cool. The shot-to-review time is lightening fast. I LOVE this camera, if you can't tell.Cons: If you have picture preview, and are using the screen to frame shots, the delay is sort of long. (Just use the optical viewfinder to avoid this problem.) The macro mode.. didn't like that preset. Did better getting further away and zooming, but that changes the depth of focus. Need to figure out the manual settings that work for this. Battery life wasn't great: I got about 100 pics, but that's why I always buy a back-up. I'm hard on batteries. Use the LCD all the time, show lots of people the shots, etc. Although the batteries are proprietary, they're not too crazy expensive: less then $25 here.I thought about the higher resolution DX7640 (6MP, 3x optical zoom), but a manual lens cap? Are they insane? I'm as lazy as the day is long, and would either never put it on, or lose it right away, and end up with a scratched/useless lens very quickly.I haven't tried the EasyShare stuff, like the dock for the computer and the printer, but some might find this nice. The pictures this camera takes are well worth printing, that's for sure, but I use online printing.This camera has reinstilled my love of taking photos (note: not photography.. I'm definately not a pro, just a consumer that wants to document puppies and children before they become dogs and adults). The difference a short shutter lag makes is HUGE for me...As a rank novice, point-and-shoot person I am, I can't tell you about the advantages of the more advanced features. But apparently the PASM can be advantage, if you're smarter than me. For me, I shoot, upload, crop, email and/or print.I would also like to recommend Photoshop Album for those that are getting into digital photos. It integrates well with this camera, and allows you to keep all your photos much better organized. In my years of digital photography, I've accumulated about 4000 photos... without Album, it'd be near impossible to find particular photos.", "Date": "September 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Perfect digital camera for anyone except super-pro!!", "Author": "M. R. WONG", "ReviewID": "R2TN2K821SUN3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have received this Kodak new digital camera DX7440 for two weeks. The lithum-ion battery and charger that come with the camera are nice extras. The 32MB memory is enough for 20 pictures or about 1.5 minutes movie in highest resolution. I love the movie mode right away. The camera also record sounds, I filmed my cousin's birthday party with a brand new 256 MB secure digital memory card. We connected the camera to the big screen 42\" TV and it was a moment of blast!! We laughed and enjoyed every moment of it. It captured a lot of details and it seemed that the camera erased a lot of my hand movements and shaking; i.e. stabilizer. The sound recorded was good as well. Man, the pictures are wonderful. We went to the dark backyard at evening time, played hide and seek, and the viewfinder lighted up and I saw everybody in the viewfinder even though it was very dark. The flash light worked excellent in dark as well and the pictures turned out great no matter day or night. The 4X optical zoom was amazing, better than my other friends' 3X; and the viewfinder was big measured at 2.2 inches wide. The joystick was fun to play with, it controls a lot of things, such as when reviewing your pictures and you like to zoom to an area and enlarge it. The camera lets you zoom to 8X as big when reviewing pictures. Man, you see a lot and a lot of details. And, the quality is so amazing!!! I am so much in love with this light-weight Kodak that I want to enjoy its full extend by purchasing the camera printer dock and print pictures myself. As of this writing, I am waiting for the printer dock. I will give you an update soon. Man, this is one heck of a digital camera. Kodak, you did it! Highly recommended. -------------------------------------------------------------- Update One (8/6/2004): Later found that the CD that comes with the camera contains interactive tutorials about how to use the camera, how to email photos, how to printer photos, etc. Nice!! Just got our 10\"X8\" photots ordered from Ofoto.com, the pictures look perfect, no distortion, vivid and true colors. We even got our first 10 free 4\"X6\" prints. Wonderful!! I know that its capable of getting up to 20\"X30\". Yet, we don't have room for that big a picture yet. My Kodak Printer Dock has just arrived. It automatically recharges the battery, nice!! Emailing pictues to friends and relatives is just one touch away after inputting email addresses. It's so very easy!!! ----------------------------------------------------------------Update two (8/9/2004):  The camera comes with 10 4\"X6\" free printer dock photo paper, the printer dock also comes with another 10 free 4\"X6\" photo papaer.  I printed 5 of my pictures; since Kodak says that the printer automatically laminates prints, I put one of them in a bowl of water and see.  I got up the next morning and picked up that picture from the water, the pictures was still intact.  The lamination was perfect and make the picture free of weather attack.  Still, one has to keep the picture from direct sunlights, but at least it is free from moisture attack and finger prints.  This is an advantage over other print sources for 4\"x6\"s.The quality of the prints are also great, with true colors and sharp clarity; just as how they look from the viewfinder.Some of my friends ask if there is another Kodak that may be about the same quality, functionality, but cheaper.  I also suggest the LS743, which also let you take 4.0 Megapixel photos and TV-quality movies with sound.  I think that that one is slightly cheaper from Amazon.com.  Yet, that one has a slightly smaller viewfinder and 1X less zoom (3X instead of 4X of the DX7440).Also, taking movie seems easier than using the camcorders.  The advantage is that it is smaller and lighter, making it easier to carry around and my hand does not get tried fast.  The quality is already TV-quality, which is the same as the camcorders.The disadvantage is that the battery does not last as long as the camcorders as theirs are heavier and bigger.  And, movie length is limited by the size of your memory card.  So, you may need a bigger card to take longer movies.  Yet, memory card prices are getting cheaper and cheaper; and battery lives are getting longer and longer.In conclusion, this is the camera for all the photo and movie needs, with ease of use and handy features, especially big viewfinder, TV-quality movie functionality so one can occaionally take movie for memory.  My other friends are surprised by its various abilities and quality.", "Date": "August 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera! Highly Recommended", "Author": "Jonathan", "ReviewID": "RSISSCXAOM8CU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This incredible 4.0 mega pixel camera comes with an amazingly big and high-resolution 2.2\" TFT screen and is equipped with a fabulous professional-quality SCHNEIDER-KREUZNACH VARIOGON lens, capable of 4X optical zoom, which is - in my opinion - very impressive. The camera is compact and very aesthetic, easy and comfortable to use. It has excellent features, such as the very smart and useful \"Share\" button, 16 programmed scene modes, 5 color modes (low color, natural color, high color, black & white and sepia) and 2 movie modes. You can also choose image resolution out of five options: 1.1 MP, 2.1 MP, 3.1 MP, 3.5 MP and 4.0 MP.The camera also includes manual and custom controls. You can choose between auto mode (camera sets settings for you), scenes mode, program mode, aperture priority mode, shutter priority mode, manual mode and custom mode.A feature which I found helpful is the image-rotating sensor, which automatically rotates the vertical image once it's taken. It saves you the trouble of doing it yourselves with an image-editing program.The important feature that this camera offers, aside from many more terrific options it has, is the \"Share\" button, that allows you to tag pictures for printing and for emailing, and later when you connect the camera to your computer it can do that immediately - according to the software settings. The software is not the best I've seen, but still it's pretty good (of course, there's lots of room for improvement). I personally don't like it very much, but it helps you organize your pictures and it also has some minor editing options that help you make corrections in your images to achieve the result you want. Once the camera is connected to the computer, the software wizard pops up and helps you transfer the pictures from the camera to the computer. Also, you must work with this software in order to create an email address book and then transfer it to the camera so that you will be able to tag the pictures. For instance, if you have Friend 1 and Friend 2 in your address book, you can do the tagging so that the image will be sent to Friend 1 when the camera is connected to the computer.I am generally very satisfied with the camera, and it surprised me big time when I got it with some awesome things that I didn't expect to see. The camera delivers stunning pictures at an excellent quality. The pictures are sharp and detailed, colors are accurate and the result is as good as promised. The first few pictures I took with this camera didn't turn out very successful, but since these were my first ones and I hadn't known how to use the camera fully, the camera is not to blame. The last few pictures I took are stunning.I have a 256 MB SanDisk memory card. With an empty card like this I can shoot a video in 640x480 mode in the length of 13:55 minutes. You can also choose the 320x240 movie-shooting mode, which allows you to make a 24:28-minute long movie. That's a very good thing that I haven't seen so far in the cameras I know. The video comes out very good, but the thing I was disappointed about is you cannot use the camera zoom while shooting a video.The menus are nicely designed, have lots of options and let you choose and control quite about everything.One thing that I found lacking is the way the mode dial is built. \"Video\" and \"Favorites\" are both located behind \"OFF\", and that means that you have to turn off the camera first and then turn it back on to get to these.I have owned it for a pretty short time, but already impressed a lot from it, but then again haven't fully figured out how to use all the smart advanced features it has to offer. I bought my camera for 283 dollars, and I think this camera is a great value for this amount of money.The camera comes with a Lithium-Ion rechargeable battery (isn't it much better than those AA batteries?) that takes about two hours to recharge, and all the necessary accessories, plus the EasyShare Software CD and a manual book that explains the basic things you need to know about the camera and the way to use it. The book is very helpful, and helps you learn what you need to know.Plus, the fantastic Kodak website offers all the support you need (and if you lost your book you can find it there and read all of its contents on the web!), advices for taking pictures and using your digital camera, and of course if you want to buy and haven't decided yet, just go to the camera page, where you'll find everything you want to know: detailed camera specifications, larger views, camera demo, package contents, features highlight and system requirements. I highly recommend visiting the Kodak website.I would recommend the camera to anyone. It's simple and easy to use on one hand (you just turn the camera on auto mode, take as many pictures as you like and then press the \"review\" button to see them); but it's professional and has many options and qualities on the other hand, and that allows the advanced user to produce great images maximizing the camera's abilities. The camera also has an option for a date stamp for those who don't want to forget when the image was taken.Summary: Superb camera, except one weakness - the software. Apart from that, I must say I'm really pleased with this camera. You get your money's worth.In my opinion, the Printer Dock / Printer Dock 6000 (you might want to wait for the new model, Printer Dock Plus) would be a perfect addition. The Camera Dock would also be a nice thing to have.", "Date": "August 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent quality", "Author": "Lake", "ReviewID": "R26ORPM5MI2S98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a full featured yet easy to use camera that takes excellent quality pictures and has a high quality 4x optical zoom lens.It is extremely fast in focusing and taking pictures, and the focus is almost always perfect. It has a large number of preset settings for circumstances like landscape, portrait, close up etc, but has manual options as well where the enthusiast can set all the settings. It has a burst mode to take pictures rapidly and the ability to take 3 bracketed exposures to get just the right one. The shutter can be set for as long as 64 seconds, for long exposure shots of dark scenes.The image quality, which is where cameras must perform, is really excellent. There are setting to adjust the sharpness and color saturation to the users choice, so if one wants more muted colors they can be obtained. The usual 'normal' setting though provides rich perfect color. I've taken over a 1000 pictures on this camera to date and have been delighted in the quality of the vast majority--any problems have been the photographers, not the camera! The color reproduction is perfect both indoors and out. Kodak cameras tend to give pictures with high color saturation, but as mentioned, this can be toned down in one of the settings if desired. I like the saturation as it is--looks vibrant and lifelike. The 4 megapixel size is plenty--I've had 8x10 prints made that look identical to film.Battery life is excellent. The flash is powerful for indoor shots, and it's power can also be adjusted by one of the settings. It is easy to use--the settings are intuitive and the controls are easy to use and easy to find on the camera.The price for this is also great--making it a stand out deal in the 4 megapixel, 4x zoom lens category.Highly recommended--easy enough to use by a novice, but has more than enough settings and features for a more expert user.", "Date": "August 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "A GOOD CHOICE", "Author": "H.

The ones that seemed to be the best were Nikon (which has an attachment for photographing slides), Canon, and (surprising to me) Kodak. The factors that turned me towards this camera were:1. 4.0 megapixels. 3.2 megapixels is the minimum to get decent pictures that print up well at sizes up to 8x12 inches. Different settings provide different formats in terms of relative dimensions, which may result in some cropping of your pictures (a 3x5 picture will be cropped compared to a 4x6 because of the different dimensions). You can set this camera to shoot at different resolutions, including 3.2 megapixels, which is ideal for shooting 4x6 inch photos. You can select sizes down to 1.2 megapixels, with corresponding losses in resolution and gains in the number of photos that can be stored on a memory card.2. Quality of the pictures. The resolution and color are excellent. I used it in Florence this last week without flash in the museums, and found that this camera is far better than film cameras with 400 speed film in picking up images.3. 4x optical zoom, which is significantly better than the 3x offered on most cameras in this price range. Anything more than that, and you'll get blurred pictures, unless you use a tripod.4. The camera is about the right size (many Asian manufacturers miniaturize their cameras to the point they are hard to use), and is comfortable to hold.5. Ease of use. The automatic setting will handle most situations, but the camera also has a large number of pre-settings and allows a limited amount of manual control.Like all digital cameras, you will have to buy several accessories to use this one properly, including:1. A large memory card. 512MB will store in excess of 350 pictures at fine resolution. Larger cards are now available, but the manual doesn't discuss them, which may mean they're incompatible with the camera.2. A charging dock, which will allow you to recharge the camera without removing the battery  by just plugging it into the dock. The DX 6000 charging dock will take voltage inputs between 110 and 240, which means you can use it overseas, provided you have the appropriate adapter.3. A larger battery (1750 mAh) to replace the 1050 mAh battery the camera comes with;4. A carrying case. Get the cheap small one [ASIN: B00006HXMQ]5. Hold off on buying a printer dock until you know whether you will actually use it.

My new digicam? Another Kodak, the DX7440.(...)A few months ago I was looking for a camera for my mom. Since she's somewhat of a technophobe, I wanted something simple. And since your close-up vision starts to go south with age, I wanted something with a big LCD. I also wanted something that about the same size as her old film camera. I brought her to Best Buy and we looked at a bunch of cameras... from Olympus, Canon, Sony, and Kodak. I ended up getting her the DX7440, even before I'd reviewed it.I'm no technophobe, but I went to look at the camera and was plenty impressed. The LCD screen is huge and high resolution. Life Jeff's mom, my close-up vision isn't what it used to be; compared to the two Canons, the Kodak LCD won in a walk. I found the Kodak's menus much easier to read than the Canons'.But that wasn't the only thing that made the Kodak win. Not only were the Canons' menus hard to read for me, they were unfamiliar. Doubtless my learning curve would have been fairly short, but I already knew the Kodak's menus. Also, the \"scene\" customization for the Kodak was slightly more comprehensive and scenes are very easy to select.The Kodak was praised in reviews for its extremely short shutter lag, short shot-to-shot time, and, importantly to me, its low-light performance, including that it would focus even below 1 lux. Its specs in these categories were superior to the Canons'. Both cameras offer full-manual operation, though neither allow manual focusing. The Kodak permits time exposure up to 64 seconds, four times as long as the Canons.Nonetheless, everything involves tradeoffs. For the Kodak I gave up AA-battery power; the Kodak uses a KLIC-5000 or 5001 proprietary batteries. The 1050 mAh-5000 battery is included and I bought a 5001, 1700-mAh second battery. So far, though, the OEM battery is doing well.I also gave up some compactness. The Kodak is noticeably larger than the Canons, though not massively larger. So the Kodak is not quite as \"pocketable\" as the Canon models -room for that big LCD has to come from somewhere. OTOH, the Kodak's larger form factor makes room for dedicated buttons on top for controlling flash, focus and exposure, which I have already found very useful.Two features the Kodak has that the Canons lack is a diopter-focus knob (again, important for my presbyopic eyes) and a shuttle-jog dial on the top-right rear for easy manual customization. You can also save a manual setting as a custom set, enabling you to create your own scene mode. I don't think you can do this on the Canons.Both cameras take video with sound. The Kodak will take VGA (640X480) size movies, but only at a jerky 15 frames per second. It also takes 320X240 video at 24 fps, which is 4/5th full speed. That video looks pretty nice actually, but it has less resolution than the VGA mode. Both modes are superior to the Canons, and both modes on the Kodak will record to the limit of your SD card. A high-speed card is not necessary. On my 512kb card I can record more than 45 minutes of 320/240 video, not too shabby! The Canons' recording lengths are limited to 30 seconds in VGA, at an even more miserable 10 fps, and three minutes at 320/240 at 15 fps. Clear winner: Kodak, and you don't need a high-speed SD card to record either mode.But there is a serious drawback to the Kodak package: the included Easyshare software simply refuses to install on my computer. Judging from the Kodak forums  online, I'm not the only one with that problem. I have other photo-management software. HP's ImageMixer was included on my computer, so I'm not out of luck, and the free-download Infraview takes care of redeye, editing and color management. (Speaking of redeye, DC Resource said that it was a real problem on the Canons, very little on the Kodak.) But doggone it, I paid for Easyshare and I want to use it - it's supposed to be a very good package, anyway.

Like most, I love the exposure flexibility and lens options onthe SLR but the simplicity of the other is useful on most occasions.So, of course, I'm looking for the best of both worlds.The key things I was looking for in a camera:(in order of importance)- excellent prints up to 8x11\"...which basically means a minimum  of 4M-pixel resolution, allowing for some cropping of the shots- at least 3x optical zoom- shoot 640x480 video without an arbitrary length limit (subject to  the available memory, of course).- print photos without a computer- largeer than average size screen (>2\")- macro mode - ability to shoot very close-up shots- full-manual mode - allow control over all aspects of the  shot, just like a high-end 35mm camera- assisted-manual mode - choose one key setting, such as shutter  speed, and the camera will optimize the other settings for the  best shotAfter much online research and two trips to the local camera shop, Iended up with a Canon camera and printer.  The salesperson had WRONGLYtold me there was no video length limit.  But even though the built-inmemory was enough for several minutes of video, it would cut off after30 seconds for no apparent reason.  Additionally, the printer couldonly print from the camera, not the computer, which I discovered afterseveral hours of frustration.  I was glad that I bought it locally - Ireturned both items.  Incidentally, I bought them at the local WolfCamera.  While it could be had cheaper online, the price differentialwas not much and the service was great.I ended up with a Kodak DX7440 and Easyshare Printer/Dock.  I also boughta 512M expansion card for the camera.  Total cost ~$600.  Normally thiswould be a little pricey for my taste.  But with the arrival of thekids, the upcoming holidays with the grandparents visiting and a smallwindfall in our pockets, we decided it would be well spent.  It was.Kodak's DX-models are the enthusiast line.  One step above the consumerline (CX), but one below the pro line (Z).  This translates to aprofessional-grade lens, but still a compact size.SizeIt is small, but not tiny.  About the size of most point-n-shoot 35mmcameras.  IMO, if it was any smaller, it would be too small to holdcomfortably.  For reference, I have slightly small hands for a 5'10\"male.  It is a little thick for pants pockets (except cargo-style pants)but fits nicely in a jacket pocket.ScreenThe 2.2\" screen is large enough to view pics without squinting.Coupled with the \"favorites\" gallery, it's a great way to show offyour pics if you happen to have the camera with you.  It seems tobe bright enough for viewing anywhere, but I have used it only afew times outdoors.Ease-of-useAfter demonstration by the salesperson, I have rarely consultedthe manual (maybe never?).  The on-screen display and help arevery intuitive.  The most-frequently used photo options (flashsetting, burst and normal/macro/lanscape) are on the topof the camera.  The zoom is right in front of the shutter button.The camera modes and menu/review navigation are all controlledwith a dial and joystick that is intuitive, but probably toosmall for fat-fingered-folk.  I would have to rate the ease-of-useas excellent.Auto-modeAccording to the reviews, this camera has one of the best \"auto\" modes- which is very point-and-shoot.  In my experience, most pictures intypical situations come out very well.  It has a no-red-eye flash modethat works very well.  Except, of course, that the double-flash tendsto make people blink and distracts kids.  The Easyshare software (on thecomputer) does an excellent job of removing red-eye with a click of abutton - so I rarely use the no-red-eye flash mode.  However, thisediting is not available without the computer, so when I'm planningto print directly from the camera, the no-red-eye is a necessity.Macro-modeThe macro-mode (very-close-up) is pretty darn good - they claim aminimum focal distance of 3.9\", which I have not confirmed butI think I've come close to that.ScenesIt has 16 scene modes, such as daylight-beach, night, sunset,snow, portrait, indoor-party, sport, text, fireworks, museum,backlight, etc.  These are very handy because giving the cameraa 'hint' about the environment you are shooting in greatlyincreases the photo quality in difficult environments.  I'veonly used a few so far (backlight, party), but they worked well.I didn't compare them to \"auto\" mode on the same picture.VideoWith the expansion memory, it will shoot almost 30 minutes of 640x480video at ~15fps.  Although I don't remember it mentioned in the specs,I seems to have anti-shake compensation because the vids seem steadierthan my hand.  Unfortunately, the native format is quicktime (.mov)which none of the grandparents computers had installed.  So I alsoneeded some software to convert to a more Windows-friendly format.I wondered if I would really use the video features - they have beengreat for the intended usage - sending vids of the boys to the grand-parents.  While we send them plenty of pics, I think they really loveto be able to see (and hear) the kids playing, rolling, sitting, etc.PrintingThe print quality for 4x6\" prints are excellent quality, IMO.  Theylook as good as any 35mm shots I've ever produced, anyway.  Printingfrom the camera directly to the printer is pretty easy.  Dock, turn on,choose picture, choose size, print.  You can print 1 4x6, 2 3x4s,4 2x3s or 8 2x1.3s on a single sheet.  The special paper/printcartridge packs cost $25 for 40 prints.  This comes to 60c per print,which is kinda pricey.  However, since we never print a picture wedon't really like, I'm not sure we are spending much more per picturethan with film.  The instant gratification is nice when visitingfriends and grandparents can take the pictures home with them.SummaryObviously, I'm happy with the purchase.  I'm sure there are camerasthat take equally nice pictures and cost less.  And the Canon printercost significantly less per print to operate.  But for the combinationof features I was looking for, this camera/printer was a great choice.", "Date": "April 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera that makes you a pro!!", "Author": "T. Y.

I agree with the other user that the movie mode is a blast!!!  the TV-quality of the movie is just wonderful and I have a 512 MB secure digital card that stores up to 24 minutes of movies in the highest resolution of this DX7440 movie mode.Most of the time, I use the \"auto\" mode to take still pictures.  The colors are not satuated.  I don't quite understand why there is another review that suggests the otherwise.  The trick is that, one has to press the shutter button half-way for half a second, let the computer chip analyze the brightness, colour pattern and speed of the object BEFORE totally pressing the shutter button all the way down and take the picture.  Try it, and you get a much improved results.When you take pictures in \"auto\" mode, the huge 2.2 inches LCD screen shows where the focus is with a pair of squares.  If you are taking picture of a moving object, the computer chip senses it and automatically traces the object; this is some high-tech feature!You can also use manual mode to select your own focus point.  This comes in very handy.All in all, I highly recommend this Kodak DX7440.  I have owned a SONY, Fuji cameras.  One was 3.2 Megapixel, the other was 2.0 Megapixel.  In no way, can those two cameras' quality matches the Kodak's.  You don't have to take my word for it, try it yourself.  This [the Kodak] is the BMW or Lexus in digital photography!!I have one suggestion for Kodak though, the flip-door on the side of the camera where the USB connector is, is hard to open.  I think that using a hard plastic door will fix this.  However, this is just pretty minor.After I installed the software, I connected the camera to the computer with the USB cable and it automatically uploaded the pictures and movies at once.One can use the Kodak software to enlarge photos and zoom left and right.  This is pretty good.  One can also adjust contrast, brightness, make black-and-white photos, cut unnecessary parts, etc.  One can even download from Kodak for a better software and have more editing features.I have also considered the new SONY 4.0 megapixel with full movie mode camera, I forgot about its model number.  Anyway, it is not important, I've found that the SONY's picture was kind of fake and the movie mode doesn't provide enough anti-handshake power.  The Kodak is definiety better.If I would ever consider buying digital cameras, I would only consider either SONY and KODAK, I wouldn't consider any other brand, not even CANON.  Last time, Sony won.  This time, the Kodak DX7440 wins hands down!!!If BMW is the \"Ultimate Driving Machine\", the KODAK is the \"Ultimate Picture Taking Machine\" !!

The Kodak Easyshare camera DX7440 says just how easy it is in the title. This phenomenal camera has brought pictures to awhole new level of quality and will have an individual wanting to take more and more pictures than ever.  The sixteen automatic scene modes programed on this camera have made the quality of my pictures sky rocket. Modes such as \"objects in motion\" to \"distant scenery\" create anexcellent picture quality. The fact that there is a long lasting battery gives the individual time to pick which mode they would like to use; it's not a race against time. Disposable cameras on the other hand tend to be a \"pain in the butt.\" The only option an individual has is to have a flash or not have a flash. Also, there is no substance or quality to the picture. An individual does not have the option to look at their picture on an lcd screen opposed to the Kodak Easyshare camera,  which provides an excellent screen.  The best feature Kodak Easyshare camera provides is the \"movie mode.\" There are a total thirty-two mega bites available for personal recording. This product providesvideo recording, saving individuals the hassle of using both a camera and a camcorder.Whenever there is a movie someone would like to delete, it can be deleted with the click of abutton; pictures can be deleted as well. On the other hand, disposable cameras only provide pictures; movie options are not available. Also, pictures can not be deleted from a disposable camera.  Another available option that comes equipped with the Easyshare camera is picture sharing. This easy to use program comes right with the camera, along with a touch up program to fix red eye problems. This process takes seconds depending on the total amount of pictures stored on your camera. There is one cord that connects a camera to the computer allowing each picture to be stored on any computer. Two-hundred pictures can be stored on the camera at one time. Purchasing a digital camera saves  an individual time by emailing pictures to friends opposed to copying them on a machine and then sending them through the mail. This process is costly and inconvenient.  A digital Camera is expensive, but worth the money. Digital cameras save a person time and money, but also gives a person the choice to delete what pictures they do not like.

In comparison, Kodak DX7440 has a great form when holding with right hand, large LCD, very easy to use, lots of features. It's also cheaper than theother two products by about $100. So it's a great value. I took some photos in the show room, and with the larger LCD (2.2') display the Kodak DX7440 seem to have pretty good picture when comparing to the other LCD displays (1.8').So I bought it. But when I uploaded the pictures I took onto the computer and blow it up using Windows XP picture viewer, I see significant amount of noise in the photo. The edges of objects were a little blurry.

Sure, there are a few flaws (explained later), but overall, this camera is awesome; a full 98 of 100.  I bought this camera nearly 8 months ago, and I've had maybe three times where I couldn't figure out how to get a  GREAT picture.  Not just a good picture, but a GREAT picture!  I've used the auto settings indoors and out, the movie video to record the kids playing in the [high glare] snow and videos of rushing rivers, catching fish; I've used the fireworks setting (and actually turned out some beautiful photos of fireworks!) Try that out on any other camera.  The multi-picutre (\"like a model\") setting where you take 6 or 9 photos in immediate succession has produced some terrific shots I would have otherwise missed using my regular camera.  I wish I could show you the zoom capabilities - we went to the mountains, and I used the \"mountains\" setting, and it was incredible. I've never run out of space for my pictures, and I've had several hundred of them at a time, including videos.The software that comes with the camera is great, too!  I'd been using Adobe Photoshop for nearly two years, but now I use the Kodak Easy Share instead.  Red eye?  Click.  Now they're blue eyes.  Photo dull?  Click.  It's autoadjusted.  The only software adjustment I'd make it to auto click the zoom in and out feature, or by keystroke, but hey, maybe it does and I just haven't found it yet.  I don't like the file folder settings very much, because when I renamed them later, it couldn't find it.  (Adobe can find it...)I really wanted a \"larger\" camera that fit my hands, and wouldn't get confused with my cell phone in my bag, but was small at the same time.  I like the \"adjustable\" view finder, where I can set it to my very own vision characteristics, not the \"generic\" 20/20 vision.  I also like the easy turn of the settings, but locked in place so I don't mess up.  Can you tell I LIKE THIS CAMERA!!!!The downs sides:  Like others, the re-sestting of the date everytime you take out the battery is just nonsense, and frankly, well below Kodak's standard.  I didn't think it would bother me, as I though how often would I take out the battery?  I never took out the other ones.... Well, if you want to recharge the battery, you take it out!  (Or you can buy an adapter, ranging from $25 to $200, depending on what else you might want it to do, like print, sort, etc.)  Normally, I like the date on my photos, but the automatic date on this camera is HUGE and bright yellow.  Too big, especially when you crop the photo and get only a partial date.  So I turn it off, and self date when I upload to a website, or on my own disc.I LOVE the quick shutter response -- no more \"lost\" shots while the camera readied itself or focused; but I do not love the time it takes to re-ready itself after showing a preview.  But I can turn that off if I like.... but I do like seeing the preview to make sure I captured the shot I wanted.I have not been able to get a good, distant indoor shot, say at a graduation setting.  I can get the lighting right, but without a tripod, I cannot get it sharp enough.  So, I've given up on that! But I haven't tried all the settings yet; I imagine there's one that will work.I've had the fortunate experience of shopping for a digital camera for my son; and guess what -- even 8 months later, I  $100 cheaper than advertised at CompUSA; new in box, full warranty.

Not knowing too much about digital cameras I did a lot of research on options, reviews, and prices, and I came across the Kodak DX7440.  I bought it, holding my breath wondering whether it was a good camera or a lemon, and found out it was neither;  This is a GREAT camera!Things I like about this camera...-Intuitive design.  All the controls can be accessed by the thumb and the forefinger.  A dial around the shutter release controls the zoom lens, pressing the shutter release halfway down controls the auto-focus, a large dial in the rear selects the different functions, and a tiny joystick in the center of the dial cycles through the function option.  You can literally control the camera with one hand.-Nice feel.  The right side of the camera is enlarged with a rubberized surface to give a better grip on the camera, and it's heavy enough to feel like it's not just a cheap piece of plastic.-viewer.  The LCD viewer is huge, bigger on this camera than I've seen it on others.  There is also an optical viewer, but I've found that I don't need it.  It also allows you to cycle throught the photos you've taken, and if you don't like it, a press of a button deletes it.-photo quality.  This camera has a color enhancing chip which brings out the true natural color of the subject.  Photos appear as if you're actually looking at them, instead of just a flat image like you'd see in film.  This $250-$300 digital camera takes just as good or even better photos as my friend's $1000+ regular camera-aesthetics.  The one thing that turned me off from getting a digital camera is that most of them have a weird new-age shiny silver case, like something NASA would make.  This one is much more conservative, with a subdued metallic flake gray with black grips and lens.-compatability.  You can plug it directly into your PC to transfer the photos for email, OR you can take out the memory card and bring it to a drugstore photo kiosk, OR you can plug it directly into your TV via video out and show your photos or mini-movies on your television.-low light quality.  The low light photos this camera takes isn't too impressive, but it's no worse than a regular film camera.  However, if you use the \"night time\" option, and if you can hold the camera steady enough, the shots it can take are almost breathtaking.Things I don't like about this camera...-Battery life.  The battery holds enough charge for maybe 50 pictures, becuase the the LCD viewer you're using to take them is a huge drain on the battery.  Remember to turn it off when you're not using it.-too many confusing icons.  There are more icons you need to look up than there are on your PC, and not all of them are helpful.  Some of the best photos I ever took with this camera had an icon of a garbage can appear on the monitor when I shot them, which I take to mean \"my photo was a piece of trash.\"-Constant need to reset date.  Every time you take the battery out you need to reset the date, and it gets old fast.  However all the other settings you put into the camera remain.  Weird.-Accessories.  The DX7440 comes with 32 meg of memory, which you will find out quickly that it isn't enough.  You're required to go out any buy an additional SD memory card to take advantage of its capabilities.  There's also an available docking station which recharges the camera without needing to remove the battery, as well as transferring the photos you took to the PC.  You don't absolutely need it, but Kodak does its bit to \"encourage\" you to buy it to make your life easier.All in all, an excellent first time camera with only a few things to detract from it (unless you don't care about them, in which case, go ahead and give it another star).

Movie mode is awesome and with sound makes for great memories when \"filming\" holiday events. It's connectivity to your TV is simple and straight forward for family veiwing. I bought the 256mg card and that's good for almost 15 minutes of video. With just a few minutes of video the card will still hold a few hundred pictures.

I'd prefer to have the colors in my pictures actually represent the colors in whatever I'm shooting.So I ended up returning the Kodak DX7440 and getting a Pentax Optio S4i instead. The Pentax doesn't match all of the Kodak's good features (it's not quite as good ergonomically, has a less powerful flash, and offers less manual control) but its color rendition is more natural, and it's super-compact size means I can carry it in a pocket and literally take it anywhere without a second thought.If the Kodak didn't produce such overblown colors, I would have had a very hard time giving it up.

I was thinking of the bigger players like Sony, Cannon, Nikon, ect but I love this camera!1- It takes great pictures. A lot of cameras these days are 6 or 7 MP and a 4 MP camera sounds ancient. However, a 4 MP is way good and I actually put my settings to 3.1 MP. I developed it at the store at it look just as good as a 35 mm camera! Also, I can store a lot more pictures at 3.1 MP and am VERY satisfied with the image quality.2- It's FAST. Takes the picture when you click the button! You do have to wait a few seconds to take another picture (there is a processing time) but I find this much more bearable than the initial lag that some cameras have.3- It's very user friendly but offers other options for more advanced picture taking. You don't even have to read the manual to use the more advanced options- it's great.One of the disadvantage is size. I was well aware of this when I bought the camera but I wanted something nice in my hand that I can hold. I now wish I would have gone with a thinner camera so it will fit in my pocket. I am younger (21) and when you're going out to clubs, you're usually not bringing a huge purse so the camera seems kind of bulky. However, I do like the feel of this camera much more than little ones. If I was middle-aged, I'd much rather have this one than the tiny ones. I have no problems with the size other than when I'm going out.I did tons of research when I bought this camera and have 0 regrets. However, I will make other noteworthy concerns by other reviewers that I took into consideration when purchasing this camera.1- the wheel is small and you need to push this little button simultaneously while turning. If you have large hands, it might be a problem. I am a small girl, so it works fine for me (not my father). Also, sometimes the wheel can be hard to move if you haven't used it in a long time. It's a delicate wheel, don't force it or it will break.2- be careful when replacing the batteries.

This camera is suited for the amateur photographer whose is just beginning to use a digital camera.  Yet the pictures taken with this camera deliver high quality.  For those trying digital photography the Z730 is the perfect camera.  The best features this camera has are the ease of taking pictures and the numerous settings for different picture - taking scenarios.  The zoom dial on the Z730 is located on the top right of the camera and is used by moving it to the right or left.  Many cameras zoom buttons are located near the display screen on the back and while you are trying to take the perfect picture, it has passed.  When you take a picture there is no delay like many other digital cameras which is great for catching that perfect moment.  There is also a shutter sound after taking a picture which assures that the photo has been taken.  The photo can be viewed on the 2.2 inch hi - resolution display screen on the back of the camera.  Many other cameras with the same price offer a 1.5 inch display and lack the resolution quality on the Z730.  With many digital cameras you must go through several menu pages to pick the setting for different picture taking situations.  The Z730 has a small dial on the back and you can turn it to take pictures in low to high lighting, fast moving objects, different color shades, and the list goes on.  The flash is easily turned off by pressing a button on top of the camera and does not require going through an options menu.  Offering a Kodak Easyshare camera dock and the ease of transferring your pictures from the camera to a personal computer (PC) is one of the major selling points of this camera.  The camera dock is only available for the Kodak Easyshare cameras and relieves the photographer of taking the memory card to a local developer in order to obtain pictures.  The dock prints in high quality and it is simple as scrolling through the photos and pressing the print button on the printer dock.  The camera comes with a compact disc and USB cable for transferring photos from camera to PC.  The compact disc explains a step by step process of taking photos from the camera and placing them on the hard drive of the computer.

The plastic battery clip broke the first time I replaced the battery, a month after we got the camera.  Then after we got it back the shutter that acts as a lens cover would stick.  Sometimes it would stick open, sometimes it would stick closed.  Worst of all, you'd pick it up, switch it on to capture a moment and then discover that the cover was stuck halfway open.  We lived with the problem, as a little nudge with a fingernail would get the cover unstuck.Then the shutter button stopped working -- every other control and interface worked, but you couldn't snap a picture.  We sent it back again and asked them to look at that problem and the lens cover problem.  When we got it back, the shutter button worked but the lens cover stuck half-open the first time we tried to use it.

Zoom doesn't work when you're in movie mode -- you're stuck with whatever magnification you had when you started to capture video.Now that we're going to have to send it back a third time for the lens cover problem, we asked Kodak if they'd just replace the camera with a more reliable model, as this one has had one problem after another.

I'm not a photography expert, in fact I've previously only used cheap consumer cameras, but this seems like a pretty good one to me. As long as you have good lighting, it seems hard to take a bad picture with this camera. Using the Auto setting, most photos come out looking great (in my opinion). There are also a couple dozen special scene modes for capturing specific types of scenes. I've mostly only used the one for closeups, which worked well.However, I haven't yet figured out how to take decent photos in low light. Outdoor photos taken at dusk tend to look like they were taken at midnight, even with using the night setting. If you use the flash in a low-light setting indoors, it tends to completely illuminate the scene and make it look like broad daylight. If you turn off the flash, the image is usually too dark to see anything. Even increasing the brightness/gamma in photo editing software doesn't help, as the detail just isn't there. I'm sure there's probably a way to take photos in low light and get them to look like they do to the naked eye, but I haven't yet figured out how to do that.Once you take a picture, the camera shows you a preview of that photo for several seconds and a few of the other reviewers have mentioned this as an annoyance because it takes several seconds before the camera removes the preview and goes back to normal mode. This can be turned off so that the camera never shows a preview, however there's no need to do that. While the preview is being displayed, you can partially press the shutter button to immediately cancel the preview and return to normal mode. In fact, if you press the shutter button all the way, you can immediately take another photo.As others have mentioned, the battery clip, at least in the earlier models is extremely flimsy and will eventually break, no matter how careful you are. The problem is the battery is constantly pushing against it while in the camera and the cheap plastic just isn't strong enough to hold it forever. Kodak should have used a metal part rather than plastic. Thankfully, the compartment door will hold the battery in place just fine. Also, if you hold the camera upside down when inserting or removing a memory card, the battery will stay in contact and you won't have to reset the time and date.From what I've read, the maximum size memory card you can use in the DX7440 is 1GB. While that's plenty of room for hundreds of photos and almost an hour of 640x480 video, the problem is that 1GB cards are relatively scarce now. You can't go into any major store without finding 4GB SD cards, but try to find a 1GB one! I had to order a couple online and paid about as much for two of them as I would have for a 4GB card. It's not just that the camera won't use the extra space, it won't even recognize a 4GB card. A sales rep at Staples told me that I could use a 2GB card and that it would just use half the capacity, but I didn't feel like experimenting.Finally, I know a lot of people like the Kodak Easyshare software, but I hated it! I don't use my camera every day, so I only want the software to run when I need it, but yet, like most software today, it automatically installs itself in the startup so that it runs every time Windows boots. I removed it from the startup, but then getting the camera driver to load was hit-and-miss. Often, I'd have to reboot my system to get it to recognize the camera. As for the software itself, I found it quite primitive. I couldn't find any way to select a range of images to transfer off the camera or to delete. It usually just transferred all the images by default. I also didn't like the way it basically hid the actual files from you so that you had to access them through the Easyshare software. I'm more of a computer nerd, and I want access to the raw files so that I can load them into other programs, manually attach them to email, sort them into directories, burn then to a data disc, etc. I just didn't like the way the Easyshare software seemed to want to be your one and only way to access the photos. Now I just pop the memory card into my card reader and use whatever software I want to access the photos. Much simpler for me.Since you can now get the DX7440 for less than $50, it's a great little bargain. Just don't expect any support from Kodak, even if you buy it new. They consider it outdated and won't even answer email about it.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "The modern Point and Click", "Author": "Michael A.

When my first basically wore out after of several years of hard use and thousands of pictures, I was still so impressed with its performance that I sought to replace it with another of the same model.  It is light and easy to use.  Although not as compact as some of the latest digital cameras, it will readily fit in a jacket pocket.  I take it with me whenever I don't want or need the bulk of my digital SLR.  For most situations, it is literally a 'point and click' type of camera:  turn it on, aim, shoot.  The most common controls, flash mode and zoom, fall readily to the fingertips.  One caution - the zoom feature is great until you push it into the digital zoom mode.  Then you really should use a tripod and hold the camera really still to get decent picture quality.On the back, the on/off switch is part of a mode selection 'wheel.'  When you slect any of the photo options, a brief (very brief) description of the function appears to assist you in making your choices.  Among them is a video mode which includes sound recording.  I find it to be about the quality of a Skype video.All told, I think this is an excellent camera for anyone who wants a compact, sturdy and relatively inexpensive digital camera for everyday use.

Battery life is great, I'm able to go through about two days of consistent use on our trips before I need to recharge. Speaking of which, recharging is a cinch, I bring the little charger, plug it in at the hotel room in the evening and by the next morning I'm ready to go (usually takes less than that but I plug it in and go to bed).My only problems have been with trying to use the camera in lower lighting situations, like at my children's school assemblies and performances. Perhaps I'm not using the settings correctly but those pictures are coming out too dark with the colors off.This has been one of the best presents ever.

Wilkinson \"DX7440 4EVER!\"", "ReviewID": "R3959VW0WBSVRX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading the negative reviews on this little camera, I felt obliged to put in my two-cents' worth!  I've used a Kodak DX4530 (Excellent camera) for about 4 years now and decided to hand it down to my daughter.  I came across a DX7440 in a pawn shop.  It was mint condition, but the pawn shop owner thought he fried the camera accidentally. I handed him $25 and walked away with my PRIZE!  I ordered new batteries for it, THREE KLIC-5001 batteries for $18 TOTAL.  I was not sure if it would work until I received my batteries, charged one and tried to use it. Well, it worked.....and is a fantastic little camera. No need to pay $30 for a single battery when you can order a set of 3 KLIC-5001's for a total of $18 (already includes shipping).It may not be small enough to fit into your pocket, but unlike the newer pocket-sized cameras, the DX7440 has large front and back hand-grip areas - where the newer cameras are SO compact, that there is no place to grip the back with your thumb, and little area on the front.  So I would gladly give up a \"pocket option\" for these benefits.  Plus, the \"feel\" of this camera in my hand represents (to me) a feel of quality.As for fuzzy pictures, I have yet to take one where it was the camera's fault.  Now that I know all the options available on my DX7440, my family is stunned at the quality of pictures from this little camera. I took three pictures using the three obvious features and the picture started out VERY blurry.  The second was still awful, but much better than the 1st.  The 3rd picture, using the top \"flower\" button option, was stunning!  So one only need learn the abilities of the camera.As for not taking pictures well inside or in dark areas -- again, using the correct simple options available on this camera, I have yet to miss a great picture opportunity in the dark.  They are fantastic!  One must simply read the manual and learn the camera.  It is truly a great little camera with so many options for the price.The unlimited video-taking is great and the quality of the video is great. Keep in mind that this is a digital CAMERA, not a dedicated video camera.  Obviously, the internal memory is insufficient for handling much video. So you would be well advised to purchase additional memory for your DX7440.The automatic lens cover is great!  My DX4530 had a cap that popped off and dangled from a tether.  So the auto-lens cover is a welcomed addition.There are only two negative things stated about this little DX7440 that I cannot defend.  One is that the battery clip (orange tab) breaks easily.  But it is an irrelevant piece.  The door holds the KLIC-5001 quite well.  I'm not sure about the KLIC-5000 battery, given that it is a thinner battery.  But personally, I prefer the 5001 because it lasts longer - and the 5001 charger came with the camera from the pawn shop! Be forewarned though: DO NOT try to charge a KLIC-5000 battery in a KLIC-5001 charger.  You will fry the battery!The other negative comment made about this camera is a biggie!  The Mode Dial (or \"wheel\" as we are calling it) can be a problem for some.  My camera works perfect, as does my parents.  But when I tried to find a good used one for my sister, the first one arrived with a Mode Dial that would hardly turn at all.  I returned it.  I bought another used one, which camera is in mint condition.  But again, the Mode Dial was very difficult to turn.  After using it quite a few times, my sister says it's working just great now. Not sure what causes the Mode Dial problem, if it's preventable or user-induced problem.  The used we bought for us and the used one we bought for my parents work like a charm! Initially, we took my sister's camera to a camera shop and they suggested that it may have some dust or dirt lodged behind the wheel (and this must have been the case, since hers is now working great!) The wheel is obviously connected to the control circuit board, which is essentially the entire camera.  So if there is a problem with the wheel of a NEW camera, you would be well advised to return it immediately to have the problem fixed by Kodak.I would mention as well, that it is better to first deal with Kodak via E-mail.  You will get personal attention a little easier that way, and be locked into a particular person.  They DO have nice and knowledgeable people there....if you go about it the right way!  It may not be as simple as picking up a phone, but it will get the job done!We now have three of these DX7440s in our family and we are ALL very thrilled with the picture/video/sound/option qualities of this little camera.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "A WINNER", "Author": "philadelphia phil", "ReviewID": "R2L4EFA8CNUQJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WHEN YOU PURCHASE THE DIGITAL CAMERA....I BROKE MY FIRST ONE AND I LIKE IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT A 2nd.", "Date": "November 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Camera Ever!", "Author": "J.

The main features I was looking for was 3-4 megapixel resolution and 4-5X optical zoom and 3-5x digital zoom.  A movie mode would also be nice.  I looked for several months before finally deciding on the DX7440 from Kodak.  Kodak came highly recommended from friends and various online reviews.I purchased the camera and have been using it regularly for the past 10 days or so.  Now that I have had an opportunity to use the camera, I can honestly say it is an utter disappointment.  It is being returned to the store from where I purchased it this afternoon for a full refund.  Picture quality is a disgrace.  Out of approximately 200 photos taken, perhaps 20 of them yielded something remotely acceptable. Perhaps my unit is not functioning correctly, but most pictures are so blurry that they aren't even worth keeping.  The settings are not user friendly.  After multiple attempts to work through the instruction manual and set the camera to the optimum settings for my photos, the camera still took blurry photos.  Very frustrating to say the least.  Movie mode isn't very clear either, even when set on the highest quality.Oh, my battery clip also broke off the first time I took the battery out to recharge it.  Poor design.  The battery cover seems to hold the battery in securely, so I do not know why they even bother with the flimsy plastic clip.The only good feature of the camera is Kodak's Easyshare software.  It was a joy to use.  Kodak's statement that you can get borderless 4x6 prints with any inkjet printer is false, however.  I am using a new HP inkjet printer and the Easyshare software, even when set in accordance with the instructions will not print borderless (I am even using Kodak's print media).All in all, a very disappointing experience.  I will continue searching for a suitable replacement for my Fuji (which takes better photos than this Kodak even though the Fuji is only 2.1MP and has no optical zoom).", "Date": "June 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "Sadly a discartable good camera", "Author": "CCristina \"CC\"", "ReviewID": "RZOAJRDE60X2P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Awesomely, before the bought of this camera I read this costumer review, so well opinions, that I thought it was a good camera -and it really was- BUT JUST FOR A MONTH.I travel to Costa Rica, and it took wonderful landscapes photos,everyone was enchanted with my trip photos.

Incredibely, that battery longs a lot, so I didn't recharge up to 3 times only.  So I don't know what happends to it.But my worst nightmare became with the new Panama Kodak dealer, because KODAK offices were leaving my country, so they only kept an official distributor to do changes.Until I had to wait almost 2 months to know which would be the Dealer, the official distribuitor doesn't have any camera with  4x optical zoom or higher as I wich, and the consumer laws in my country demand to any defect product change has to be in the same or higher product conditions.So, at final february I doesn't have any camera yet, because they can't give me a 4x optical zoom camera as I bought before.

Pero al regresar a mi pais, Panama, se da\u00f1o.  Yo era tan cuidadosa al sacar la bateria, que no se como se da\u00f1o o mejor dicho se partio la palanca que sostiene la bateria.  Increiblemente la bateria duraba tanto, que a lo maximo solo la recargue 3 veces en todo ese mes.Pero mi peor pesadilla fue lidiar con el representante de la marca.  Porque Kodak estaba mudando sus oficinas del pais, por lo tanto, tuve que esperar DOS MESES hasta que me dijeron quien iba a ser el distribuidor oficial.  Para luego conocer que no tenian una camara con la misma caracteristica de 4x de zoom optico, y las leyes paname\u00f1as de proteccion al consumidor exigen que todo cambio por mercancia defectuosa DEBE ser en la misma calidad o si no, superior calidad.Por lo tanto, a finales de febrero todavia no tengo camara, porque he ido 3 veces a buscar una camara de reemplazo y ninguna tiene 4x de zoom optico como la que compre.
