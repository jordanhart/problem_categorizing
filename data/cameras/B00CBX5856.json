I wanted a Canon 7D, but out of my price range. The lens range on this camera is great and the quality seems great also. I read in one review that to use the video part of this camera was awkward. I find that absolutely not true. Turn the dial to video and push a button and you are shooting. Only complaint is the size of the bag and the light weight tripod.  The tripod is way too light for the weight of the camera in my opinion. The bag is just big enough for the camera with no supplies. Solving the problem by giving the bag and tripod to my cousin for Christmas to use with her small digital. But, if you are reading this, try to find a package that gives a charger instead of a tripod.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very nice package deal", "Author": "David DeQuick", "ReviewID": "R1SQB46ZBJX1Q0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Though I only recently purchased this camera I am very happy with it so far.  This camera takes crisp, high quality photos and has excellent macro and zoom lens optics.  It's fairly intuitive for basic use and the automated settings and I can't wait to learn everything it can do!  The package deal was a very good price and offered every accessory component that I will probably ever need including a tripod, filters, case, etc.  Time will tell but it may be the last digital camera I will ever purchase for the next 20 years or so.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Denise", "ReviewID": "R2CLMIS85L8XMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Still exploring all of the possibilities but the camera does all the thinking for me for now.
