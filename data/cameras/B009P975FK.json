{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ease of Use", "Author": "Sim", "ReviewID": "R3BGJ2FODLF747", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fujifilm's latest addition to their F series of travel zoom cameras is the FinePix F660EXR. Packing a telephoto lens, full manual control and Full HD video recording capability in a slim body, the F series is targeted at those who want serious shooting capabilities without having to carry too much bulk.The F600EXR is available in black, blue and red. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, but a tad heavier than most ultra-compacts due to the slightly larger body and telephoto lens. The edges of the camera are well rounded and the glossy finish lends it an attractive look. However, you'll have to keep a piece of lint-free cloth handy to get rid of smudges that accumulate too easily.Fujifilm has paid a good deal of attention to user comfort, especially while shooting. There's a large rubber grip on the front and rubber dimples for the thumb on the rear, just below the mode dial, for a slip-free grip. This greatly adds to the comfort and inspires confidence while shooting. The rear of the camera is dominated by a large 3-inch LCD screen, which has a resolution of 460K dots. The layout of the control panel is pretty standard with a 5-way d-pad and dedicated buttons for playback, video capture, F-mode and Display/Back. The F-mode button brings up a small menu from which you can set the ISO, image size, drive mode and color mode. A jog dial around the d-pad makes menu navigation a breeze. The d-pad arrows double as shortcuts for instant access to macro, flash, self-timer and EV controls. What we really liked was the placement of the mode dial. There's a small hump on the top right corner to angle the mode dial so that it can be rotated with only your thumb, and is right in front of you while shooting. The flash pops up from within the body on pressing a button on the left side. It's locked when the camera is off and automatically sinks into the shell when you switch off the camera. A mini HDMI port and a proprietary USB port for data transfer are housed under a flap on the right side.Right from the shell to the buttons, dials and flaps, the build is excellent. We couldn't find anything tacky or lacking in usability. The only thing we didn't like was the all-glossy shell, which picks up smudges like a magnet.FeaturesThe FinePix F660EXR is pretty much the same as the F600EXR with the built-in GPS and RAW support removed. Both models, and even the F500EXR and F550EXR, share similar specifications and design. At the heart of this camera is a 1/2-inch CMOS sensor with an effective resolution of 16 megapixels. Note that this sensor is slightly larger (15 percent) than 1/2.3-inch sensors found in most compact digital cameras, so you can expect better control over noise with the ISO speed set even above 800.At 24 mm (35 mm equivalent), the lens is wide enough to capture a broad field of view from short distances. You won't have to stand too far from a subject to shoot full-length portraits or large groups of people. Capturing distant scenes is effortless too, with the lens extending to 360 mm, which translates to 15x optical zoom.Apart from the regular auto and PASM modes, the F660EXR offers EXR, Advanced, and Scene modes. For better understanding, each scene preset flashes a crisp one-line explanation along with a thumbnail example on screen. Some of the interesting presets are:Natural and With Flash: Shoots two images in a burst, with and without flash.Portrait Enhancer: Skin appears smoothDog and Cat: Optimizes focus by using face detection for dogs and cats.Night (Tripod): Clear shots of night scenes at slow shutter speeds", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Get this amazing camera before they're gone folks !!!! Doesn't get much better than this", "Author": "Neo \"Mr. Anderson\"", "ReviewID": "R226NDUI2I9C28", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well this Finepix F660EXR have been in my wish list for a long time but I finally listened to my gut instinct and made the purchase of the ridiculous low price of $112 free shipping. These things sell for $300 on ebay. And the nice candy red color is even less than the other color options.Ok now on to the meat & potatoes, does it take gorgeous pictures in low light or indoors which is the most important criteria to me? A big emphatic YES. I currently have a Nikon S 8100 which I'm perfectly happy with and I also owned and sold a Canon S95 not too long ago and this Finepix takes pictures just as good as the $400 canon s95 which also is rated as one the best compacts out there. I really didn't think it could best my S 8100 but it does. So why the switch? well I was able to buy the S 8100 for cheap and with this Finepix on clearance price of measly $112 it was a pretty decision as I could sell the S 8100 on Craigslist for prob more than what I paid for this Finepix.What I love about this Finepix is that it has most of the advanced options as the S95 but it's much more user friendly for a novice like myself. NOTE: I maybe a novice but my eyes are as discerning as the pro users because I have much experience with video and home theater so I know what a good picture should look like. My Nikon S 8100 takes super nice pics as well but the scene options were a bit lacking, This Finepix is a perfect balance between the S95 and S8100.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazingly high quality camera for a low price", "Author": "AndrewS", "ReviewID": "R1UR4K7UO7ALR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not only do you get a lot of features for a very low price, but camera is relatively sturdily built, the automatic settings work very well, and it takes excellent pictures. I continue to be mightily impressed with the camera, several months after purchase. Low light performance is excellent since it has a MOS chip, something almost non-existent in cameras near this price.Only drawback is video: quality is moderately good, but built in mic is poor and there's no mic input, and almost no control over shooting perimeters.

Lots of functions, and attractive, seemingly high quality. Takes a bit of time to learn the locations of everything.

Let me go over some of the highlights of this camera for you.SENSOR SHIFT IMAGE STABILIZATIONWhile it's not as good as optical image stabilization it's better than the old digital only type and having it at all is better than nothing.  During normal usage I haven't found it to work that well for photos because it is difficult to hold a compact camera steady.  However for video it is a life saver.PRO-FOCUSThis handy feature allows you to blur the background which works best when taking photos outdoors.  It does this by taking 2 shots and using the information to keep the subject in focus and blur the background.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  It works best when your subject is wearing colors clearly different from the background otherwise you could have a situation where the left half of the background is blurred while the right half is still in focus.  Typically it's easier to use a long zoom with the macro setting which works extremely well.HIGH ISOThis camera really loves to bump up the ISO which after ISO 400 the images gets noticeably noisy and smudged.  Personally I try to keep the AUTO ISO setting at ISO 400 max and use a slow sync flash indoors.  If you need to shoot at high ISO I'd get a DSLR.PRO LOW-LIGHTThis is my favorite feature of the camera.  It works by taking up to 4 photos at once, which with the EXR 1/2\" sensor accomplishes it lightning fast.  The 4 photos are merged to enhance detail and remove noise.  I only wish it had a setting to merge the 4 photos for DETAIL without removing the noise (I'll do it myself on the computer or keep the noise so as to not sacrifice detail/sharpness).  This setting greatly enhances dynamic range and smooths the edges without blurring them.  These photos when sharpened further look incredible.  Sometimes it tends to overexpose the image though.BEST SHOTHigh fps shooting BEFORE you fully depress the shutter button and AFTER (you can customize the amount of shots before, during and after) allows you to get that perfect shot 90% of the time when you are dealing with a subject that keeps changing their pose (like my wife who can't keep still) or blinks or doesn't smile at the right time.  Let's say your subject smiles half a second before you normally get a shot off.  This feature will allow you to capture that moment.SELECTABLE IMAGE QUALITYSelectable from 4mp, 8mp, and 16mp, I prefer to use 4mp most of the time which speeds up processing and saving images to the card.  Sometimes the 4mp and 8mp photos look even better than 16mp.  That is really unique to the EXR CMOS sensor and Fuji's image processor that downsizes the images to your selected megapixel.Now that I've gone over some of its features let me tell you about the CONS of this camera.FUJINON Glass ED 15x f3.5-5.3 lens 24mm-360mmThe 15x zoom is fantastic with it being most sharp at 3x zoom.  But I expected more sharpness out of the lens with it being an ED glass lens.  The f3.5 lens is not a sensitive lens for indoor shooting so that's why the camera defaults to bumping the ISO so high.  In order to get the most sharpness you have to use PRO LOW LIGHT mode outdoors in sunlight and then sharpen it in post processing.SMALL BUTTONSThere's 3 dials and they are tiny and difficult to adjust.  Basically Fuji packed so many features onto this camera that there's just not enough physical space to conveniently use them all on the fly.  If you have the time to set up the dials before taking a photo (such as shooting food) then this is fine for you.  Otherwise it's best to leave it on one mode (I switch between PRO LOW LIGHT for outdoor sunlight and SP Portrait for flash indoors.  For outdoor night time I'd use SP NIGHT TRIPOD.HEAVYIt's built like a brick and that is a pro, but it's definitely heavy at 196grams, basically equal to my old Sony DSC-W5's 197 grams from 2005.  The Sony's slightly larger sensor at 1/1.8\" and 5mp arguably took better photos too, but it couldn't handle noiseless photos at ISO 400 like the F660EXR can.This so far is my most favorite compact camera I've ever used.  It has extremely fast autofocus and no shutter lag for a small camera, nearly on par with DSLR's and certainly better than any compact I've ever used before.  But as good as it is it will never replace a DSLR even with its PRO FOCUS and PRO LOW LIGHT features.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Read the review that says...Everything top notch except the picture quality.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R14PLZ7NHZE6B0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HATE IT.

That being said, both of the models are incredible, and very very affordable. they are also small and fit easily in a pocket. Of all the digital cameras I've had from when they first came out, I have to say Fuji 550exr and 660exr are the best. What the cmos does is sense color pixels. The pictures the 550exr and 660exr cameras take are fabulous and clear. The absolute favorite thing I like about these cameras is the ability to not use the flash. They take great natural light pics, and indoors too. You just push the flash down and that's it. no flash. great at concerts where flash may be banned. great to not use flash and blind people. want the flash? then pull it back up. terrific!The camera is a full function camera where you can even take super closeups. I use it for everything from flowers to ebay items. It will also do panorama shots, and of course video. The battery is a flat lithium battery and charges quick. Plus, the camera doesnt eat power like other digital cameras!! Ever put a camera down for a few days only to find out the battery needs charging? not these!
