The video picture is ok but the sound for the video really sucks.  Love that its waterproof but I'd prefer better sound and picture instead of waterproof.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for the money.", "Author": "James D.

I bought it for my grand daughter, it will meet her expectations, we won't feel bad if she breaks it or loses it cause it didn't cost a mint.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Image quality really bad", "Author": "KMARTIN", "ReviewID": "R330PU5ZBSJ3UZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The idea of this camera is great and, it seemed to be made well. However, for day to day use, the LCD is extremely dark and hard to see. Also, any slight movement results in a blurred photo (so dont buy this for kids). Also, the flash has to charge between shots and takes a full 5-7 seconds between pictures. Lastly, the menu isnt intuitive at all. For pure under water purposes, it may be just fine. Just not a day to day camera", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "SVP WP6800 delivers quality images with CMOS Sensor (Max. 18.0M via interpolation)\nWaterproof digital camera you can use in any condition\nThe 2.4-inch Color TFT LCD monitor allows you to see the images in detail.\nFace detection technology recognizes up to five faces in a photo and automatically controls focus\nSmile shutter mode helps you capture more smiles", "Name": "SVP Waterproof 18MP Digital Camera& Video Recorder (Pink)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kwEj6AorL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003V5D3AA"}}
