{"Reviews": [{"Title": "not the best, but not the worst", "Author": "E. May", "ReviewID": "R2N80C72BPR7XF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking for a replacement for my Nikon coolpix that I dropped, but couldn't find a new Nikon cp that was in my price range that had AA batteries.  I read other reviews/features for the GE and thought it was the best deal for my money.  I'm an artist so I take lots of photos of animals and kids for reference.  This camera has lots of great scene settings and does have a good stop action.  The price is good, and the high mp lets me enlarge my photos also.  It's almost impossible to find a camera with AA batteries, and is one of the main reasons I chose this.  So it has many great features that I like, however, the things I don't like, that are very annoying for me, is although the iso is 1600, like the nikon, the nikon takes great photos in almost darkness, without flash and this one takes lousy low light photos.  if it's even the least low light, it suggests a tripod and does a slow shutter speed.  It's impossible to get a clear photo in low light if you don't want to use a flash.  Also, I don't like to use the flash unless I absolutely have to because of color accuracy.  Therefore, I generally leave it turned off.  You can't do that with this camera.  Everytime you turn the camera on, you have to turn the flash back off.  Also, everytime you turn the camera on, you must choose your scene or auto setting.  You can't just turn the camera on and shoot.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera- Highly Recommended!", "Author": "Julien", "ReviewID": "R1EFP57964BALU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "5/5 on this Camera. I highly recommend this purchase. It produces amazing image and video quality and has great built in speakers for sound. The power consumption on the batteries isn't too too bad. I suppose it could be better but they use AA batteries and those really don't cost a lot of money at all so it's not a problem for me.Great little buy for $59.00! If you're looking for just a basic point and shoot camera for outdoor events, portraits, parties, or you just want to record something relatively close to you- go for it!", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good For the Price", "Author": "kindasorta", "ReviewID": "RLJBPL7WENB6L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall a very good camera 'for the price.'  As with any pocket point and shoot camera its fantastic outdoors, ok indoors, and passable in low light situations.  There are a ton of different modes for different situations, and most of them work very well.  Not much shutter lag and battery life is excellent.  I was able to take about 400 pictures with the included AA batteries, many with the flash on which is very impressive.  Panorama is a nice feature but you have to line up the shots manually, which is often difficult to do and get a good panorama.The cons:  Its very light and portable which is a pro, and a con.  Its very light in your pocket but seems very fragile, one waist high drop would probably kill this thing.  The wrist strap included also does not adjust to your wrist so I would suggest an adjustable strap instead. Also the shutter release button is very cheap feeling and flimsy.  Its often hard to detect when the button is halfway down when trying to focus.  The camera also 'forgets' settings when powered off like suppressing the flash, digital zoom off etc, which is quite irritating.  Lastly, this camera has difficulty focusing on a subject properly when zoomed into an object, long range photos often come out slightly out of focus.Why four stars then?  Because generally speaking for casual use, the photos are fantastic...for the price.  If you're a serious photographer I'd opt for a better model but for basic snapshots and such, this does a passable job and gets good battery life.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good point and shoot camera", "Author": "Lewis Martin", "ReviewID": "RM4UCR8WTMMWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a simple camera that workes well to keep in my truck.This camera is a great point and shoot camera, it does everything I need it to do.I have taken about 100 photos so far, this camera works well and takes clear pictures.I haven't changed the batteries yet so it must be good on battery life.This camera takes pictures as clear as my Nikon Cool Pix L810.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Complex enough for my 12-year-old...", "Author": "David Rinehart", "ReviewID": "R3KWAEBFZ9LPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...and simple enough for me!Purchased as a present for said child.

I like the little cameras...just drop them in your pocket or in a pocket in you purse. I like to use AA batteries, too...just swap them out when they are dead...only takes a few seconds. The video is fun, but the zoom in and out action is not smooth.

I love that it takes AA batteries which are available everywhere! And I like the fact that it uses a SDHC card and that it is plug and play. Just insert the card, bam, instant memory. You NEED to use an SDHC card because the internal memory is NOTHING! This is definitely a good point and shoot camera. And I love the zoom feature. It comes with a wrist cord but you should definitely invest in a camera case.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesomeness", "Author": "KrijgerGeist", "ReviewID": "RCSH1ONXSX4AG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lovin the Panorama shots.  I can take pictures of people and Pan-shot myself in the picture as if I was there with them.Took this camera clubbin, there is no night vision, so video was dark.  It would have been awkward if we brought a bright light in a dark place where people are dancing.  But then again for the price, who can complain.Also took pictures at nighttime (without extra lights), pictures came out not too good.  Person in the picture came out looking weird with the background really dark.  But when I shot the video (at night, same place, same ambient lighting), the video came out much better than the pictures.  (Mind you I'm still learning how to use the features)So to remedy this trivial situation, I just take videos (during nightime) and upload the mov files to Final Cut Pro, capture the still images, and voila!  Perfect images captured.  FCP can also do color correction and image brightening but that's for another review.  I've become a lazy amateur pseudo-photographer so I just shoot videos and pick out the favorite images.Havent dropped this camera yet (no intention to).  Instead of buying one of those soft case camera bags for 10-20 bucks, I splurged on a $1 Glasses Case (made in Tokyo).  It fits perfectly with a long lanyard sticking out.  It is also probably the best protection for this camera.  And since it's in a glasses case, it may not attract camera thieves in the local nightclub.Another awesome thing about this camera = disposable battery usage.  But do not buy the 99 cents only batteries, they do not work on this camera for some reason.  Spend the extra $2-3 on batteries and they can last you a couple of events/nights of photo/videography.Awesomeness :)", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Shannon Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R2T3JM4T120CMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

Uses regular batteries, not rechargeable, which can be a pain when your battery runs down and you aren't anywhere you can charge it easily and does come with a fairly good sized memory card.
