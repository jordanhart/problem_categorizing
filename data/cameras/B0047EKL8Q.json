It is made out of some kind of heavy duty steel (heavy enough that you would not want to drop it - in fear of injury) and should be durable enough for use outdoors for many years. The paint job is an excellent beige color, all sides are coated and should help to prevent corrosion as well as look nice. This bracket would not quite clear the corner on my building (mounted 15' up on the corner that gets the most Michigan weather) so I used two 2-by-4's mounted on either side of the bracket, and then anchored the bracket to them. This mounting method worked well. It also gave me more clearance to mount my camera an inch or so further away from the building. I think I could literally hang off of this bracket and it would support my weight (5'11\" 250lbs). The bracket came with four hefty looking nuts and bolts which I did not use but will save for another project. I removed one star because there was a scratch on the bracket which did not appear to break through the paint job but concerned me enough that it might weaken the corrosion resistance over time. Overall, the workmanship is high on this part and it should allow you to mount your camera equipment (especially a PTZ camera) on any corner, no matter how heavy/big your equipment is (so long as the bracket is anchored well).", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yes, somebody bought one one these.", "Author": "Dave K.", "ReviewID": "RP1R2DNFN9KNN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is such a specialty item, I'll bet that even the seller is surprised that somebody actually bought one through Amazon.com. The holes in this bracket apparently line up for a specific make and model of security camera, which severely limits its application. In my case, I was looking for an outside corner bracket for mounting a Agasio A622W Outdoor Wireless Pan/Tilt IP Camera with IR-Cut Off Filter for TRUE COLOR Images (Not Washed Out), Auto-Iris (Auto-Brightness Adjustment), IP66 Waterproof Enclosure, 50ft Nightvision, 4mm lens (72\u00b0 Viewing Angle), Synology & Blue Iris Compa... above my patio. This bracket is well made, sturdy, and with a durable paint job. But since the hole pattern didn't match my camera, I had to improvise. I used  Gorilla Glue 50004 Adhesive, 4-Ounces to attach a small piece of 1\" X 6\" outdoor treated lumber to the face of the bracket, covering the holes. Then I used a router to open up the two large holes and the space in between them in the wood to make room for the camera's connectors. I attached the camera with outdoor-rated wood screws and washers. I then used some 3M Scotch Foil Tape, 2-Inch by 50-Yard to protect the otherwise open top and bottom from rain and insects, and finished it up with paint to match the trim on my house.  It took some effort, but it's working great.I realize that it's unlikely that many people would go to this much trouble to mount an outdoor security camera. So maybe the manufacturer will take the hint and eventually offer a treated lumber-faced outdoor bracket that can be used with ANY outdoor security camera.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0047EKL8Q"}}
