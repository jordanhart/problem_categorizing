{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Owned for two full years.  True tips.", "Author": "Coolkayaker \"ck1\"", "ReviewID": "R26RTVB4PHFKID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned two of these fake cameras for two years.They look real.  They are small, but the LED light is noticeable.The other, larger fake cameras require screw in mounting, and  you should be ready for that.  Then, it's hard to replace the batteries (and if you mount it low, people will play with it and see that it's fake).  But, with this GE camera, you can rest it on something--such as the window sill above your front door, and it's effectively peering down on people in front of your house.  You can set it on any flat surface.It is pricier than the other large fake cameras, and the LED is not as large.  On the good side, however, the blinking is only about once every fifteen seconds, which is realistic and saves batteries.  I have changed the batteries in this camera once in two years; the batteries will keep blinking for about 18 months!  That is great!  My larger wall-mounted fake camera blinks annoyingly every 5 seconds, and batteries last about 4-5 months tops.  It is more visible, though.I like this camera more than my larger one for the reasons above.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good fakes!!", "Author": "Kwan", "ReviewID": "R3PM0SRYWF9GUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As we all know the world of wireless is very popular. I do have a monitored security system with one wifi enable camera inside the house but I wanted to put more in different areas of my home so I purchased the decoy cameras for additional deterrence.I have a cleaning crew that comes monthly and various handymen that fix things as needed.  I just feel better by having the additional decoy devises inside and outside.  When my friends see them they think that they are real because they look very authentic.These blink red on the camera and really does do the job for me.  I have four of these around inside and outside.  The ones outside cannot be exposed to the weather so I could put them where they can not get wet.  The battery life on these are good also.  I have a few that I have not had to change the batteries (2 AA's) now for six months.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is my second one, the first one lasted about 4 years.", "Author": "Louis Navarra", "ReviewID": "R3CL92BN2B0QSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second one, the first one lasted about 4 years. The batteries went dead 2 times in that span. I took the old batteries out replaced them and it never worked again. So i bought a new one. If it still works for 4 years i will buy another one.

I have contacted the seller with only a request for a replacement (no refund) I will report back if they respond.  So far 5 days later...no response - so I have written to amazon about it. IF the seller finally responds and replaces it I will re-rate it.  IF not...do not buy this item...OK update...while the seller did not replace this item...I had orderd it several months ago and so complying with those terms...he refunded me $10.00 while I paid a lot more than that...I have to say at least I was refunded something.IF YOU BUY THIS...test it right away so you are not in a circumstance like mine where it is defective from the start.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Save Your Money", "Author": "James D.

The product was in a box that had clearly been opened and then taped shut.  The outside of the box said \"Decoy\" security camera, however the directions inside the box were for an actual security camera.  I thought \"Oh well, how hard can it be to just place batteries in a \"Decoy\" camera\"?  After I had tried prying open the camera looking for the battery compartment, I realized that I had not received the \"Decoy\" security camera, but an actual wireless security camera.  I had kind of messed up the outside of the camera so I figured I probably couldn't return it.  And, I really only wanted a \"Decoy\" camera so I just threw it away.  I don't know who is to blame for sending me the wrong product, Amazon or the company that manufactured the camera.  I will not order another \"Decoy\" camera from Amazon.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great and easy to install.", "Author": "Princeton Reader \"Princeton Reader\"", "ReviewID": "RPKVXTOPB3HW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was worried about installation (as I always am) but this one was real easy even for the technically challenged.
