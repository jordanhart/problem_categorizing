{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love the camera, accessory pack was OK", "Author": "RJ", "ReviewID": "R17TYQXMDZVNFJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far the camera has been great.  I primarily acquired the camera for use in all kinds of weather and other rated its macro feature as excellent.  The accessory pack was less inspiring but still worth the price.  Would have been nice if the camera write-up had indicated that is came with a charger and battery, but no memory card.  The accessory kit  did come with the memory and the extra batteries are nice.  Really didn't need the extra charger although the one in accessory kit was 12VDC compatible, so that's a plus.  The mini tripod is worthless and the camera was too large for the case.  Despite feeling like the accessory kit was a grab bag of stuff just thrown in, I'm not disappointed with the purchase.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$266.84", "Features": "A backlit 16 megapixel sensor coupled with the new-generation imaging engine delivers a top sensitivity of ISO 6400\nFurther enhanced waterproof construction allows for depth of 45 feet\nTriple shake reduction with sensor shift shake reduction, shockproof for drops up to 6.5-Feet, cold resistant to 14 degrees F, dustproof\n3-Inch LCD, HD 1080P video with h.264 compression @ 30fps\n6 LED macro lights for macro illumination", "Name": "Pentax Optio WG-3 16MP Waterproof Digital Camera (Black) + 32GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card + Extra LI-50B Battery + External Rapid Charger + Carrying Case + Mini Tripod Kit + USB SDHC Reader + Memory Wallet", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2B85WICpnL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C6OVL0G"}}
