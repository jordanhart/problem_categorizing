{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent camera for the price", "Author": "Jpesci", "ReviewID": "RRY41MXWHL5I3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon A530 is an amazing camera for the price or anyone on a slightly tighter budget. The first thing that surprised me about it was how small it was; at only 3.5 inches wide and 2.5 inches high, it fits easily into your pocket, and serves well as a travel companion.Pros:- Amazing image quality for a camera in this price range- Excellent clarity in macro mode- ISO 800 is useful to have when taking night shots without a tripod or flash- My colors settings are useful and surprisingly intricate; you can set a custom setting for levels in red, green, and blue individually, as well as contrast, sharpness, saturation, and skin tone- Color accent and swap are nice features for the creative type, and are often more accurate than I had expected- Stitch assist mode automatically locks exposure compensation and aperture to make panoramas easier and consistent (I would really recommend a tripod when doing this to keep the camera level, though. Stitch assist software isn't perfect)- Widescreen 16:9 framing is a nice feature (not to be confused with true widescreen, but automatically frames and crops in 16:9 ratio)- 4x optical zoom works very well- Extremely fast start-up time (about one second)- Excellent auto-focus features- Amazing battery-life (a pair of Energizer lithiums lasted me about 800 shots with LCD)Cons:- Only two aperture settings per zoom level in manual mode. ex. f/2.6 and f/5.6 at 1x, but nothing in-between (the A540 has in-between values for each zoom)- Would have been nice to have had a flip-out LCD like the A610- No Aperture or Shutter Speed priority modes (the A540 does have them)- LCD screen extremely hard to see in very bright conditions (although to be fair, this seems like a more common issue among digital cameras)All in all, the Canon A530 is an excellent choice for the price, and might be the best bang for your buck if you're looking for something with more features than your standard point-and-shoot, along with excellent image quality.", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent value for the money", "Author": "Floyd Turbo \"carl0086\"", "ReviewID": "R3NZI10Z18CS76", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't want to trash the reviewer from Florida, but reading the manual will take care of all of your problems. The flower icon is for the Macro setting. There's an easy-to-read chart of icons in the manual and if you can't figure out the icon from a chart that shows all of the icons it's no wonder that you found an actual written manual too complex. The macro produces crisp pictures with excellent color.I also use this to take pictures for eBay and it works wonderfully and needs no additional lighting. I have a simple 200watt soft light and the flash doesn't go off when I shoot items. Turning off the flash is even easier - it's just one button to push and I can't fathom why anyone can't figure that out.The ISO 800 setting is much better than on the previous PowerShots, but still isn't perfect. However, this is a point-and-shoot camera and is adaquate for almost all needs if you remember that. I shot some wonderful pictures in a dark concert hall and got excellent clarity on about 80% of the pictures - the rest had some slight blurring.I enjoyed the various settings, especially the stitching, and found them all easy to use and useful. The videos are of pretty decent quality as well, though it's not a video camera.For the price, this is an excellent camera for everyday use and special occasions.", "Date": "May 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "The Cannon A530 5MP Digital Camera", "Author": "G.

I chose the A530 for several reasons: 1- The number of shooting modes (over 17), 2- It uses two inexpensive  AA batteries rather that more expensive Lithium, or other specialty batteries, 3- The new ISO 800 setting which reduces camera shake, 4- The White Balance Control (Auto, preset for Cloudy, Tungsten, & Flourescent, and the 4X Optical zoom lens, and 5- The Post Card Size and the Date Imprint.I takes excellent clear  pictures. The color is very true. The exposure is right on. I have tried editing a few photos, and cannot make them any better by editing brightness, contrast,saturation,and color.Although it has an optical viewfinder, the LCD is bright and clear even in sunlight for composing a shot.It is on the verge of being too bulky, but Cannon has other smaller models with similar features (at a higher price).

The start up is fast and this is particularly helpful to me since I use it extensively to shoot pictures of our toddler who is always on the move and decides to do something new and interesting without a warning. With my old Samsung digital camera I missed capturing a lot of moments due to the slow startup. Also, in my old camera there was a lag between the flash coming on and the actual clicking. My daughter would invariably close her eyes after the flash and all her pictures came out with her eyes closed. Not the case with the A530. The color accent feature is very addictive. It does not gobble up batteries like many other cameras do and the video quality is good too. On the whole I would definitely recommend this camera.

Shaw", "ReviewID": "R28L490L4KAZXV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 2 weeks.  It's definately the best digital camera I have ever owned.Pros: Small, compact size, yet not so small that its hard to hold; 4x optical zoom is very effective; takes 2 AA instead of the 4 AA I'm used to - this is a good thing as long as the camera lasts a while on the two batteries; many shooting modes available, and they work well; manual shooting controls available if you need them (though I will probably not use this, the shooting modes are what I use); video mode shoots VGA (640x480 - full DVD quality) as well as a compressed mode which generates file sizes suitable for e-mail.Cons: the only con I've found so far is the SD card slot is in the same compartment as the batteries, and since the batteries are spring-loaded, it makes it a little annoying to open the battery/SD card door every time you want to get the card out to download images/video to your computer.  To solve this, I've just been using the USB cable that came with the camera to download, this way the card can stay in the camera.  The only drawback to this is the camera must be turned on in order to access the images/video, but it's a minor problem.Overall, this camera is excellent.  You get a whole lot for the money you pay.  I would definately recommend purchasing a 1 GB card; the camera only comes with a 16 MB card, which you will fill up with 20 seconds of VGA video.", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Wonderful for snapping quick shots.", "Author": "dddddsssss \"gggogogog\"", "ReviewID": "R1YJSFBA0TU7ZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought this Canon deserved more than an average of 3.5 stars, so I'm adding my comments.I bought the A530 for my daughter when it became available on Amazon.

Her product pictures on a very low end camera she bought a few years ago really needed some help.This camera is fairly intuitive, and worked well out of the box.No strong negatives, but prepare for the following:Some of the the menus are complex  and options I would consider commonly used (like photo resolution) are rather deeply buried.The memory card and batteries are located within the same access door on the bottom of the camera. This seems like a good way to end up picking up batteries.The bundled software is only OK. You can get a better organizer for free (Google's Picasa) and the editing software is nothing to get excited about.The flash options are limited to \"auto flash\" and \"no flash\". I was surprised not to find a \"manual flash\" to force flash operation (this may be one of the deeply buried options).It has lots of \"scenario\" presets (kids and pets, landscape, etc), but none of these seemed to offer any improvement over full auto. Inexplicably, the \"nightscape\" setting doesn't turn of the flash.If your needs are simple (and if you are already running an organizer like Picasa or the one in Photoshop Elements v5) then this camera should be more than adequate.", "Date": "November 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Value", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R1UJ8L8ZVZGIHS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to supplement my DSLR.

(I had a Fuji FinePix, which was darned unintuitive.  And it broke!)  It's small, lightweight (even with the batteries). Low-battery icon.  Low-memory peep.Software for transfer to computer is excellent and pretty intuitive, but do read the manual for the transfer software.  Cables and all that included.It takes AA batteries, which was the next-most-important criterion for me. AA batteries are easy to find anywhere, and they don't cost an arm and a leg.  AAs do add weight, but this was a small matter to me bcs I didn't want to be tethered to a battery charger for proprietary batteries.Also, another deal-maker was a viewfinder.  This camera has one (in addition to the screen on the back).Zoom is easy to work.  Button to take picture is centered in zoom dial. Easy to manage both with the same hand.Buy an extra memory card (the one that comes with it holds about 8 pix!).  The camera takes a garden-variety memory card, not a proprietary one (cf.: Fuji).Buy the case.  Front pocket holds 2 extra AAs.

I shopped this purchase very long and very thoroughly (many places, many brands, many types), and this one was hands-down the best for my needs and honoring my deal-makers.  Don't hesitate to get this camera.  mbUpdate, 2011:  Turn off the flash entirely and choose smallest length of time spent in \"view\" mode (where you look to see what you just took) for faster refresh.

At first glance the camera seemed a bit flimsy being made of plastic and the battery compartment being a tiny, tiny bit loose when closed, but I have to say despite that flaw, the camera is a great buy for the price. The pictures are very clear, the camera is very portable, although it is a bit thick, and the fact that it uses 2x AA batteries makes it much better than my former camera which uses a proprietary battery. I bought some rechargeable AA batteries and I'm good to go! It does only come with a 15Meg SD card, which I replaced with a 2Gig SD card I got for around $40 and now I have no worries about running out of space.Overall, it is a great buy and does what a good camera should - take good pictures!", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "A little money can get you a great deal with the Canon A530.", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R2NFHK70S8CNO8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several A series Canon cameras in the past, as well as the Canon SD series, the Canon S series and also the S2 IS.A series - In my opinion, the A series is best for you if you're looking for a low cost camera that gives you a wide range of features, many manual controls and great image quality. Especially if you love the convenience of AA batteries which are available in every corner of the world.The SD series cameras are smaller and fit into small pockets but more expensive and their smallness makes some features only accessible through the menu which makes changing between modes more cumbersome. They also have less manual controls. I also find that the smallness and lightness of the SD series makes my hand shake more than when I'm holding the A series camera with the side grip. I get more fuzzy pics with the SD series and I hardly ever got any fuzzies with my A series.The S2 and S3 have great image sensors, a great zoom and super macro function but are also more expensive and pretty bulky.The A530 comes to you at a super low price with some great features, and at this price is an easy upgrade. At this price, it is just a tiny bit more expensive than some toy cameras and makes a great gift for a \"tween\" or teen who is just starting to learn about the power of the camera lens.The A530 gives you:- A nice sized 1.8 inch LCD screen, and 5MP resolution. Seriously, you don't need any more to for regular sized prints. The higher MP cameras also create giant files and fill up my hard disk too quickly!- It has an intelligent focusing system AiAF and a DIGIC II processor which can give some pretty good results on auto mode- SD card slot - cheap to buy 1 GB. You can choose from 4 sizes for the pics depending on the size you may want to store/ print.-The controls are pretty simple too. The top dial helps you scroll through modes including the special SCN mode-Photo-stitch - For stitching together panoramic views. I have shot countless seascapes, 'bridge'scapes, and landscapes from all my Canons using this function and stitching together 6-10 shots in one. It is really easy too with the software provided which does it intuitively!- Portrait, Landscape and Night shot modes. The night shot mode gives great results if you can hold the camera steady with the delayed shutter response.-Macro mode - Great for close ups of babies or product shots- The SCN mode is great for point and shoot convenience in special situations- Fireworks, Beach, Snow, kids and pets, Underwater (with the waterproof case), Foliage and Indoor. Now even amateurs can use Canon experience to get the best shot quickly before they miss the photo opportunity while fiddling with manual controls.-The \"My colors\" option allows you to choose a color you want to highlight or darken and lighten skin tones. It also allows you to capture only a particular color in a shot while the rest of the picture is black and white. So you can do a black and white portrait of your child with a red ribbon or red ball. Or you can swap out one color with the other, like change your car color to blue from red...In a nutshell, it allows for some creativity in your pictures.-Complete Manual functions available - shutter priority, Aperture priority, White balancing, Manual focusing etc.- Tone settings for different lighting (Tungsten, Sunlight, Cloudy etc.) which helps correct the White balance-Special effects (B/W, Sepia, Vivid, Nuetral etc.) I have used sepia a lot when taking potraits giving them an 'old world' feel. Vivid has been helpful in special situations like a red kite against a blue sky to bring out the colors.-You can also take videos in 3 different resolutions with this camera and edit them right on the camera. And you can create a slide show of all the images you took on the camera itself with fancy transition effects of your choice. The zoom button shows one or many images at a time in the replay mode and you can zoom into each individual image to see parts of it closely.-Free Canon software, which though not the best in the world works well and allows you to edit images, photo-stitch images, maintain an album, change camera settings from your computer, subtitle and edit videos, upload images back to camera to transfer to another computer etc.-It uses AA batteries which are available anywhere in the world.A Sony Super Quick Charger (5 hours) with 4 rechargeable 2300mAH NiMH batteries is available for around 20 bucks Amazon! Charge these batteries up to 1000 times. I keep the LCD on for all my shots and usually I get 300-400 shots from each charge.Overall, you are getting a great deal for the price you pay for this camera.

As a rule I've found that blurriness/darkness/brightness/etc. tend to be the photographer's fault much more than the cameras, and if you use the camera a lot and get familiar with the controls you can generally find a way to take care of the problem. One feature I love is the color change: black and white shots are clear, sharp, and dramatic and can make a pretty bland subject more interesting, and portraits come out great. There's so much more detail that you would miss in a full-color photo. Sepia photos are antique-looking, and with a few props you can take photos that look just like the ones you might see in a Civil War book. For a beginning digital photographer, or someone who doesn't make high demands on a camera, this one is pretty sweet.Now, the cons: first, plan on either buying rechargeable batteries or buying a lot, because this camera burns batteries like they're going out of style. This could be because I took nearly 500 pics the first week after I bought this camera :), and probably this camera doesn't burn batteries faster than any other model in this category-I've heard digitals are notorious for spending batteries. Just thought I'd warn you. Secondly, plan on getting at least one additional memory card. The included card takes about 15 Medium photos before the you have to upload-very annoying.  The zoom is ok, especially if you utilize the digital zoom, but at just 4x it's not quite enough for my taste. It's great for normal use, but to capture that shot of a bird (or something) in that tree way over THERE-you may want to look into a few more \"x's\". It's also a little slower than I would like-it's \"point-pause-shoot.\" Which means someone can make a face at the camera and have looked away before you get the shot-so it's not so great for children or active pets! Also, it's not a \"click-click-click\" continuous camera; there are a few seconds between the time one picture is taken and the time the camera is ready for the next.Overall, despite my critism, this is a great starter camera that goes far above and beyond the conventional film cameras most amatuer photographers have (the birthday/Christmas 35mm cameras that are limited to a flash, a viewfinder, a shutterbutton, and a wriststrap) and I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't make big demands on a camera, like really fast speeds and a powerful zoom (most people don't, I expect, need pro capabilites!) and who just wants a versatile camera for taking pictures of the kids (or the parents, whichever the case may be). It's pretty simple to use, it can give clear tight closeups of objects within its range, and with a little practice it can fill most people's needs, I think.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Andrew J.

Bought it to replace my venerable 2.1MP Oly C2040.  Wife wanted a smaller camera (the Oly got left behind a lot simply because it was so bulky), and liked the feel of the A530.Outdoors, it's a great camera -- great zoom for a compact, good viewfinder for when the sun washes out the display, and continuous shoot mode gives well over 2 shots per second (with a 150X SD card anyhow -- I found my old 40X SD card bogged the camera down in continuous shoot mode).  Resolution and color are quite good.Indoors is a different story, 'tho -- the flash maxes out about around 10ft, so shots of most indoor sports are either dark, grainy, or blurry, depending on your settings.  Even worse, the flash takes nearly 10 seconds to recharge, even with freshly charged NiMH batteries.  This is an eternity when you're trying to do any sort of indoor photography.Unless you're planning to do all of your shooting outdoors, I'd stay away from the A530 (and the A540, which has the same issues indoors).  If you want small, take a look at the Canon Elph series -- spendy, proprietary batteries, and fragile screens, but the flash recharge time is roughly half that of the A530/A540.

This camera has MANY more bells and whistles than I need and although I am looking forward to learning them all I feel that it is a little overwhelming right out of the box. Don't get me wrong - right out of the box you can take a great picture even if you did not want to learn anything more about the camera and its other capabilities at all! It is very easy -- insert batteries, insert memory card, push the power button and you are ready to roll but MY GOSH the options on this little thing!I really enjoy learning and using all the functions on my cameras and home electronics but this one may take me a while. You can make adjustments in the functions of this camera very similar to how you would in a regular 35mm camera!

If you are looking to do high end work, you might want to look at the SLRs.  For everyday snapshots and photos this is more than suitable.  For a carry in your pocket camera, this can't be beat.  I bought one for my personal use, then two more for work.  At work they get used by many people to photograph construction activities (generally not treated very gently) and have held up very well.  Considerations for buying this:1.  Good price.2.  Uses AA batteries, so you aren't stuck with expensive proprietary batteries and you can always find replacements.  I use rechargable NiMH and they last a long time (deplete faster if you use the screen and flash).3.  Uses low-cost SD card.  Sony and Fuji use higher cost Memory Stick or XD.  I use 2GB Kingston cards, which cost about $40 each.  Holds over 1000 photos at max resolution.4.  The screen on the back is the right size.  The later models have a bigger screen, but you lose the space in the button area.  This model has a good combination of a readable screen and buttons that you can push wearing gloves.5.  4X optical zoom is a plus.6.  Comfortable grip.  One hand only works fine.All these small cameras have weak flashes.  Don't expect more than about a twelve foot range.  For low light shooting, I set to multiple shot mode at 1 second increments.  Then it shoots itself with no wobbling from the finger pushing the button.5MP max resolution will get you great 10x12 prints, and decent larger prints.  Anything smaller is excellent.This camera takes great outdoor pics, with good color and resolution.  I don't have to do much (if any) photoshopping on those.The included shooting modes are useful.

She's actually downgrading from a Nikon SLR film camera to this point-and-shoot and is perfectly satisfied with the features and ease of use of this camera.In my own evaluation of the camera, I find it remarkably well made and capable of producing surprisingly high quality images.  If you're wondering about purchasing a more expensive model with higher megapixel numbers, I'd say save your money.  For all around use---family pics, snapshots, etc.---the 5 MP of this camera is more than adequate for 5x7 prints.  In fact, it does something my Nikon D80 can't:  you can use the display screen to frame shots as well as the viewfinder.  An advantage I noticed during a family get together was that 3 of us had these Canons; so if you have trouble figuring out how to use it (unlikely), you'll probably find a relative who can show you how!My one criticism of this camera---and it's a commentary on many miniaturized electronic devices these days---is its unnecessarily small size.  Sure, it makes this camera pocketable, but for large hands it is a bit of a challenge to use.  More importantly, the size limits the number of batteries to 2.  For a negligible increase in size Canon could have made a camera that uses 4 AA batteries and a shot-to-battery-charge ratio that would be far more practical.  Watch how fast you go through a pair of batteries and see if you agree.

It's a feature-rich pocket-sized cam with 4x zoom: adequate.First off, the tiny, brightness-UNadjustable tiny LCD mkes framing in daylight impossible unless you're staring at it dead-on.Then, I dropped it, from my coffee table onto a carpeted floor, and somehow the crappy plastic door over the batteries broke.  I tried to return it for exchange, but no dice.  So I wrapped rubberbands around it to get it to function.  As long as I squeezed it while shooting, it kind of worked.Then, inexplicably, about 6 months into it's use, the pictures started being very blurry, no matter what I did.  I took less than 1000 shots with this camera, and am now the happy owner of a Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ8.When I bought my 530, a friend bought a similarly sized-and-priced Sony.  It has a 2.5\"LCD and is very bright.

I bought the Fujifilm Finepix A400 4 mega pixel for my girlfriend and this is 10X better! (She's gonna kill me since she wanted this one, but it was outside my price range at Christmas). The photos are crisp, detailed and clear and the menu is intuitive. It's Picture Bridge enabled. It uses an SD card, which is MUCH cheaper than the XD that the Fujifilm and Olmpus cameras use. The downloads via USB are simple.  You can download ALL photos or NEW photos or select the ones to download and you're prompted with a blue light on the camera. The pictures download VERY quickly. There's a ton of included software, most of which I will never use, but it's nice to have. The micro zoom is nice for shooting close-ups of flowers and smaller, detailed subjects.Cons: 1. Eats batteries like nobody's business - I put the included batteries in, took about 12 shots using the flash and within 30 minutes the LCD flashed the weak battery symbol. 2. Shutter lag - powers on quickly enough, but speed between shots is somewhat gimpy.Other Thoughts: I had an old Sony Maverica with the floppy disk for storage. This is my first REAL digital camera. There are a LOT of adjustable settings, both manual and automatic, that I have yet to play with completely.

As a poor college student, I could not afford a new camera for my summer study abroad trip to China in 2012. So I took this little Canon. The absolute best feature of this camera is its battery life. I was able to take about 630 pictures using energizer lithium batteries. Its size and light weight also enabled me to keep it in hand for long periods of time without getting fatigued; this enabled me to capture many nice shots that I otherwise would have missed with a bulkier camera. Like all older point and shoots, this camera is sorely lacking in low light performance and has a rather low iso range compared to the cameras of 2013. To get a remotely acceptable night shot I would have to take around five shots. Four of the shots would be blurry and unusable, and one would be clear and very noisy. In daytime this camera takes more than acceptable pictures; however, don't expect to take many good nighttime shots. The 5 mp shots the A530 makes are fine for viewing on the web and for smaller prints, but as soon as you view pics at more than 50% zoom they no longer look that great.

I have used the movie mode for over 200 videos on youtube, and though it's not HD, I never had a complaint about the video resolution.

Here are the main problems I've had:The lens cover often sticks and fails to open all the way. This blacks out half the picture. You often can't tell without specifically checking (and in the beginning I constantly forgot to check), because the image in the view screen is not visible in sunlight or at night. I've lost many good pictures this way.Although it is supposed to remember my settings, it often doesn't, so the flash is constantly going off when I've just set it to not go off (for that wheel setting). This really chews up the battery life, and make for an extremely long delay time between pix.As I said, the view screen is generally useless. That means I have to rely on the optical viewfinder, which is offset so far that I do not get what I see even with landscapes and other distant objects. Forget about anything close.The switch to review and delete pix fell out early on. I can now only delete by popping the memory card in my computer, and I can't review how well pix turn out as I take them---for example if the lens cover has blacked out half the pic again, or if the the optical offset is so bad that I failed to capture what I was trying to get.Over all, grab it if you find it at a garage sale, and be grateful if it's a gift, but otherwise try something else.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great camera !", "Author": "Huntter55", "ReviewID": "RCZ2GCLNVBJDW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchased this camera 4 years ago, and I am completely satisfied with its high quality photos.

Haviek \"mom, teacher, and light ...", "ReviewID": "R10T54L84IOKP3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera; perhaps I will have more to report in the future but these are my first impressions:Design- Very good. Not an ultracompact, but quite small while still allowing ample space for comfortable, uncluttered controls. Combo of mode dial+ D-pad allows for easy access to many handy functions. The viewfinder, though not exactly accurate, is positioned well and functions decently when the LCD is not convenient-- you can always crop off the extra later. Overall, a very nice look and functional design. However, I would have preferred a sturdier body. The A530's plastic casing feels a little fragile to me; I'm quite nervous that it won't hold up very well to average bumps and scrapes.Features- Also very good. Basically the same set of preset modes you'll get on any well-rounded camera, in addition to some manual settings. I appreciate being able to experiment with more professional tweaks, and I don't envision wanting more (aperture and shutter priorities available on more pro cameras). I like the fact that you are able to edit videos right on the camera. That means that you can keep shooting without missing anything, and then delete unwanted parts to free up the memory. Even though the video is not such high quality, it is a little perk that I enjoy.Images- This is where the A530 really shines. The first day, I was disappointed that my pictures were coming out more grainy, blurry, or off-color than I'd expected. However, after a little bit of playing around, a peek into the manual (don't bother) and some online tips, I got the hang of taking great pictures in all kinds of settings. With a little practice, I hope to become even better at it. If you want to be able to just point and shoot, I reccomend sticking with \"Auto\" as often as possible, using the flash as infrequently as possible, and set the color mode to \"vivid.\" According to my own experience and online reviews, this ought to produce in most situations. Oh, and the macro mode is awesome!Manual- Wasn't terribly helpful. Look around at user reviews online for tips. The manual basically only says what the different options are called and how to access them, but not what they mean. Fortunately, the menus are quite intuitive once you get used to them (didn't take me long) so the tech-savvy user shouldn't need much help. A real novice would probably want to just stick with a simpler camera, trade in the fancy features for better ease of use.BUT, the big BUT-- this camera is not speedy. Not at all. Without flash, it's about average- not bad, though not great. If you use the flash... well, for still life settings, it's just dandy. But if you have people posing, you'd better get it right on the first or second try because they're not going to stay for a third. This is the only thing that keeps the a530 from being the perfect family camera, which is a real pity because nothing else comes quite this close (unless you want to kick in another $200 at least, which I don't)I'm not sure yet if I'll keep this or sacrifice the features for more family-friendly speed. I generally prefer not to use flash even if it would be fast. On the other hand, it does come in handy-- often, too. And many ultracompacts are zippier in other areas, too (startup, next shot). Unfortunately, the A530 and A540 are the only Canons this size-- very small without being too tiny to handle. I'm quite frustrated now, trying to make the decision. My other main option is the SD600, almost $100 more. Any advice or other suggestions are welcome, though they'll probably just make me more confused... :(", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Cannon 530 A great camera", "Author": "M.

From the very first photo, I started having horrible experience. The night scene mode capptures extremely grainy images - nowhere close to what's expected of a 5 MP camera. Each picture takes 30 seconds or more to be saved - so you really cannot take more than 2 pictures per minute. Yes - not 2 pics per second - but 2 pics per minute. That is unacceptable by any standards - right? In addition, it has a terrible time focusing while taking nightshots.I am increasingly finding it difficult to accept that Cannon would manufacture such a low grade camera.

Although it claims to be ISO 800, it's really closer to ISO 40. You cannot take pictures indoors without it using the flash. Even with 500 watts of extra lights suspended over my subject, it still wouldn't take a picture without the flash. Contrast this with my $79 Intel camera from years ago. That worked fine indoors with no flash or extra lights at all. I wish that hadn't broken; the Canon was a waste of money.It's also very difficult to use. There are hundreds of pages of manuals that come with it, and there's no way to use it without constantly referring to them. There's no sense to the controls. For example, you have to turn a knob and press four different buttons to change the shutter speed. I still don't know what the button with the flower on it does; that must be in the Advanced manual somewhere. The zoom control is not where you'd expect it to be, nor does it move in the direction you'd expect.The only good thing I can say about it, is that outdoors, or with kilowatts of extra lights, it does take very good pictures.
