The 8 cameras around my house have not only helped keep an eye on my house but the entire area around it. I can see my cameras from my phone. if my alarm goes off I check the cameras to see who is there.

It is very inexpensive but not \"cheap\". This security system has all the features you could want in a home system.

Especially if you are buying a security system, and have problems in the week end or any other times, you should be able to get help. When I got them on the phone on a Monday, they acted like they don't give a damn. So, I do not recommend this at all.
