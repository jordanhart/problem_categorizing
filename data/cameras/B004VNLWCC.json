Needs some getting used to. Arrived as advertised with all the accesories. Would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to start taking great pictures for good memories. Throw that point and click away and get a Canon rebel.The bag that comes with it allows storage for most of the needed accesories. The filters are not that good. But filters can be purchased anywhere.Overall a great purchase and arrived as promised.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon T3 Bundle", "Author": "LarryMac", "ReviewID": "RDCJQ878V07H0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has been fabulous for us.  Easy to use and provides far more picturing taking options than we knew or need.  We were beginners but this camera has given us a ton of great action photos from our kids' sporting events and it has been a dream for us.  Everything was new as described and came in perfect condition.  Very, very happy with this purchase!!", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera For The Money", "Author": "NicoleJ", "ReviewID": "R2Q4YH54ZE1Y4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always used point and shoot cameras and have been looking to purchase a dslr camera for awhile. When I saw this deal I just couldn't resist so I purchased it and I could not be happier.  Once I received the camera I couldn't wait to use it. This camera is very easy to use and it takes amazing pictures. I would recommend this camera to anyone. Also the amount of stuff that came with it was awesome. This is a great company to deal with. Their shipping was amazing. My camera came within 2 days. Once again a great company to deal with.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Bundle! Highly Recommend This!", "Author": "Melanie", "ReviewID": "R3TAH37LZR8BF0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a GREAT package deal for everything you get with it. It might not all be the best of quality, but for someone on a budget having all these items come with the camera is a great money saver until you can save up to buy better quality items.I bought this camera on June 19th around 9am and was very surprised when 2 hours later I got an e-mail telling me that they had already started to ship my items! I was so excited I tracked the package every morning and night until finally June 21st, 2 DAYS LATER, it finally got to my house! I am VERY pleased with the speedy delivery of this camera package.I've played around with the camera since I opened the package and so far everything looks great! The camera takes amazing pictures, the quality is great! It's easy enough to use if you play around with the settings for about an hour. The only thing I do not like that came in the package is the \"starter kit\" which comes with cleaning supplies for the camera and screen protectors. The cloth that came with it is very cheap and my shirt cleaned the screen better than the cloth did, and the protector is one that you must cut on your own which makes it look funny when placed on the screen.Both lenses that come in the bundle are wonderful! And the carrying case has the perfect amount of storage space for everything that comes in the package, except for the tripod, which comes with its own bag.Other than the \"starter kit\" I have no other complains as of yet. I am very happy with my purchase, and I would definitely buy from this seller again!", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$879.99", "Features": "Canon EOS Rebel T3 12.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging - Body (Includes manufacturer's supplied accessories)\nCanon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II SLR Zoom Lens - Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens - 5pc Deluxe Lens Care & Cleaning Kit\n16 Gigabyte SDHC Secure Digital Memory Card - Secure Digital USB Card Reader - Universal Memory Card Wallet - Pack of LCD Screen Protectors\nLP-E10 Rechargeable Lithium-ion Replacement Battery Pack - Well Protective SLR Camera Gadget Bag with Pockets & Strap\nFull Size 59\" Tripod W/Case - Jumpstart Guide to Digital SLR Cameras - HDMI cable for HDTV connection - BONUS!!
