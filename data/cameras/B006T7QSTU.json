{"Reviews": [{"Title": "low shutter priority", "Author": "Shorty Jones \"Shorty Jones\"", "ReviewID": "R2INCRCRWHV5UR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera prefers to shoot at low shutter speed 1/50 to 1/100 seconds;  thus resulting in motion blur. Even if you raise ISO to 800 it drops to f8 or even f10 and maintains low shutter speed. A low aperture (f4) priority would have been better. Auto focus not a problem except at maximum 5x zoom. I have yet to take a picture at 5x zoom that is in true focus.  If you hold the camera steady and not rely on zoom the results are fine.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Overall Camera", "Author": "Brianh", "ReviewID": "R19GZ3PFEKG6U6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera more than two months ago and I am very pleased with the purchase. First the Bad. There is no stereo sound on the video clips. The sound is a bit muffled. Not clear compared with previous camers I have owned. There is only a three shot burst mode. On Auto mode I am getting a mixed result at night. Few problems indoors. The battery life could be better. I am taking mainly night shots with the flash. I am getting about 100 shots and around 8-10 minutes of HD video, then on goes the red low battery indicator. During the day you should get more pics. I purchased a 16 GB class 10 memory card and the quality of video is off the charts good. As good as any camera in its class. To improve indoor and night shots you need to go to Program mode then set the ISO to 1600 or 3200. Do this and you night/indoor resolution will be very good. The optical zoom is excellent. But you may want to turn off the digital zoom and opt for optical only. Great results. Daytime/Outdoor shots are among the best I have seen. This camers requires a bit of work. There are around 20 shooting modes. Its a good idea to experiment with these. They are there for a reason. This can greatly improve results. Overall this is a great camera and for the price the JX580 is tough to beat.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Little Camera", "Author": "Milady D", "ReviewID": "R308QUZY5QE9NV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This a fine camera for the price.

But sound is not all that important to me so it was not enough reason to send the camera back. But maybe the camera was trying to tell me something,like flash unsyncronized with picture snap, light effects not exact.focusing problem.Last week I took the camera to a friends daughter first communion. I took maybe 50 pictures of which 5 were decent but not vivid.So into the waste basket with this junker.If you do go for this cameras check it out early for possible returnIroncrossguns", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good first camera for a 8 year old", "Author": "Dawn O", "ReviewID": "R3ULBTYJR2F7VC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a good first camera for a responsible child, but within a week of having it, the charging cord broke....the end just broke off....of course, no information in the provided manual, product insert, on Amazon in the product description, or on Fuji's website tells you what kind of charger it is......so instead of ordering a replacement online, we have to head to an electronics store to find a replacement.
