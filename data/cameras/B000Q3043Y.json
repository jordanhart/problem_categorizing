{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Loaded with features, but don't expect amazing results", "Author": "David Devine", "ReviewID": "RAUW5FPACJOQL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been eyeing this camera since it was first announced.  I was looking for a decent camera, a step above the compact point-and-shoots, and a step below the DSLRs.  This camera seemed to fit the bill, and it was at my price point also.  I bought the camera with the idea that this would be the be-all-end-all of non-DSLR digital cameras for the next couple years, and I bought it before the review sites had their reviews up.Anyway, I've used the camera for a couple days now and taken about 400 shots with it.  It is pretty good, although I want to share my thoughts on a couple things that other reviews have brought up.PROSVery quick.This camera focuses extremely quick (and beeps to let you know it's in focus), and when it can't focus it lets you know.  I use it in the 'P' setting mostly, and if it can't focus (due to low light or no contrast) it just doesn't beep.  It is very quick to turn on and extend it's lens.Feature-packed.The amount of features on this thing are truly spectacular, even the creature comforts are nice (such as the histogram and over-exposure detect).  The rotating LCD screen is awesome.  It enables shots that otherwise wouldn't be possible.  You won't find another ultra-zoom on the market at this price range that offers more in this area.FeelThis camera feels nice.  It feels solid (as long as the lens cap is off).  The rotating LCD doesn't feel loose or cheap.  The on/off button is nicely located.  It makes it fun to use. The zoom is silent too.There have been a lot of complaints about the battery door being too flimsy.  I think this is a little overblown.  It's not as nice as some other cameras, but it's not that bad really.  As for the batteries being in the same slot as the memory card, I can see why for some people that would be an issue, but for 90% of the users I don't really see it as that much of a problem.  I think of it as only having a battery door since I rarely take the memory card out of my cameras anyway ( I just use the supplied cable to transfer the images and a very large memory card).CONSNoise present.There is an unpleasant amount of noise at the 8 MP setting, especially in ISO 200 or above.  This seems to be the trend, cram as many pixels as we can into this thing because the market dictates this.  Noise is comparable to the FZ8 in my opinion, however, the noise reduction is not so aggressive.This being said, I prefer some noise way more than an aggressive noise-reduction system's effects.  However, if I wanted a camera that delivers the quality of a 5 megapixel camera I would've bought one.  They are much cheaper.Lens cap flimsy.The lens cap is somewhat flimsy, falling off easily if you bump it, or even set it on a table too hard.  This is obviously so you don't jam the motor by turning it on without removing the cap (which you're bound to do eventually).  I'm used to the self-contained lens caps which retract automatically, but I understand this is tough on a camera with a lens this long.  I had a camera once that when powered up would detect that the cap was still on and beep, letting you know to take the cap off.  That's probably too much to ask these days.Red-Eye.The redeye reduction is not great on this camera (it doesn't pre-fire the flash, it just illuminates an LED on the front), so I find myself using the red-eye removal tool that is in the camera.  The results of this were only so-so for me.  I've had mixed results.  Sometimes it works wonders, others it did indeed detect and remove the red-eye, only to replace the red with an unnatural looking black (it's hard to explain, but think of what the photo touchup machine at Target would do).  If you wanna see this, e-mail me.  This is OK if you're just creating small prints, although if you look at it on your computer display at full-res you clearly see this effect.  If your subject is looking directly at the camera, the detection can remove the red-eye from both eyes.  However, if your subject is not directly at the camera, sometimes the red-eye removal only catches one of the eyes.  This is somewhat of a minor issue due to the amount of aftermarket red-eye reduction software available (CS3 anyone?).Chromatic Abberation/Blurry CornersThis seems to be a bit of a problem with this camera.  Not more so than some other cameras in this range, but it is annoying.  I don't know what exactly causes it, but I have taken shots in my backyard during daylight, and whenever light is reflecting off of something with anything dark in the background, I see this red/magenta outlines.  Some cameras remove this in processing the JPEG image(e.g. Lumix), which is something that would be nice to have.  I'm probably making a bigger deal out of it than it really is.  I've seen much worse in some of the competition.  Blurry corners seem to be a problem as well.  If you take an outdoor scene shot, you'll notice that the four corners are a little blurry and distorted.  Some people wouldn't see this being that much of a problem, but I love taking outdoor scenic shots where details like that are important.Zoom Control.This aspect is really annoying.  The zoom control is somewhat cheap feeling and over-sensitive.  It is one of those that changes zoom speed based on how hard you press the lever.  It has a slow speed and a fast speed.  However, the slow speed doesn't have enough hysteresis.  It is difficult to get the zoom speed just right.  I have a feeling the slow speed will wear out and only the fast will remain.  I actually used a S3 with this worn out zoom controller and it was quite annoying, as you could only zoom fast.If I weren't so picky I would LOVE this camera, however the less-than-outstanding image quality make it 4 stars instead of 5.  As it is, it's not perfect for indoor nor outdoor shots.

The hot shoe (external flash socket) is a HUGE help, since the builtin flash on these cameras is pretty wimpy. The camera takes unbelievably good pictures and has excellent first shot and shot-to-shot times (it helps if you use the Energizer e2 Lithium Batteries). Although the S5 weighs about 4 oz more than the S3 (About 20 oz vs 16 oz inclding batteries), its construction \"feels more rugged.\"BTW, I don't know that you need to wait for larger cards for bigger movies, etc. I use an 8gb SDHC card now. Be careful, though, which SDHC cards you get. Even with Sandisk's attempt to standardize the speeds, I found that an A-Data \"class 6\" SDHC card was about 25-35% of the speed of my Transcend class 6 card.  Also, remember that you need an SDHC card reader (I got mine from meritline for $5).", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sweetest of the Mega-Zooms", "Author": "Rachel Barr", "ReviewID": "R3GFUTR2W1J5G2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is anyone else as flummoxed by the negative consumer and expert reviews of this camera as I am?  If I were paranoid, I'd think a conspiracy existed to drive down the cost of this remarkable camera.The range of controls is very broad, their setup is intuitive, and the camera's performance is exemplary.  Not only am I pleased with how the camera handles and what it will do, but I'm WAY pleased with the images it produces.  I've had my camera for a week now; I've played with all the shooting modes and have taken pictures in all sorts of lighting.  As long as the camera is set correctly for the shot, images are consistently superb. The ones that have been anything less than stellar were caused by my own hastiness or error.Movies also are awesome, and stereo sound is a huge plus.Maybe I just lucked out and got a good copy.  Maybe it isn't really the fantastic piece of photographic wizardry I believe it is.  But I am a long-in-the-tooth advanced amateur with perfectionistic tendencies.  And in my estimation the S5 IS is an amazing tool.Minor issues inherent in a camera of this sensor size and lens zoom range do exist.  According to the many expert camera reviews, there presently is not a mega-zoom on the market that is completely free of chromatic aberration and some noise at higher ISOs.  If you're planning to print poster-sized images, get a 35mm digital SLR and some very expensive lenses--you'll be pleased with nothing less.  But if you're looking for a go-anywhere camera that bridges the gap between that big D-SLR and the teensy little super-compact in your photo bag, if most of your prints are average size, and you do the majority of your viewing on a computer, look no further.

This is not a Canon only problem and it's becoming a troubling trend as megapixels are added at the expense of image quality.It's not a matter of the S5 being better than the Sony H7 or H9, it's a matter of any of these cameras being able to equal their own previous generation model with regard to noise. The megapixel war is simply marketing nonsense unless you plan on printing wall posters or drastically cropping images. The fact is that only so many pixels can be put on the same size image sensor before the noise level becomes a problem and anti-noise electronic counter measures simply trade one problem for another.My S5 went back to the store and I'll continue to use my S3. I'll miss the hot shoe and the new LCD viewing screen, but for me photography is more about images that camera features. Eventually the companies will probably come around, but until then you may want to regard ever higher megapixal ratings with suspicion.", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Another win from Canon", "Author": "Michael Janocik \"mikesuej\"", "ReviewID": "R2UGJCDLH19WYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned the S3 for three months - I bought it at a very reputable national retailer that had a very generous return policy.  THe S3 is a wonderful camera and if you are cash strapped, you'll be hard pressed to find a better camera under $300 than the S3.  However, I did look at the Canon S5 and found it worth the $200 upgrade for me.  I buy cameras about every 4-5 years and I think the larger and higher resolution LCD makes the S5 a superior camera to the S3.  They both take great pics and I don't particularly care that the S5 has 8 Megapixels.  The best camera I ever owned was a Nikon Coolpix 950 - I'd put it's pics up against any and it was only 2.1 Megapixels.  Megapixels is for marketing purposes, but after you acheive a certain level of resolution, it's pointless beyond that.  Anyway, the S5 has some nice upgrades including, I think, a better battery door, better buttons - they're recessed and softer and have a better feel.  Also is a metal tripod mount, hot shoe, Digic III image processing, and a larger, higher resolution LCD.  The video mode allows for larger file sizes as well, which means you can record for more than 1 GB before having to start a new file.  The S3 is a great camera and the S5 is the S3 with a few nice refinements.  If you are one to upgrade every year or two, get the S3 - it's a great camera.  If, on the other hand, you upgrade every 3-5 yearas and you want the best you can get for your money right now and you can afford another $150-$200, get the S5.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "A fantastic camera, but the S3 IS is a better deal", "Author": "Ethan Winning \"Ethan Winning\"", "ReviewID": "RHX7FJ9BUOKLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The S5 is a great camera, and everything that I said in my review of the S3 goes for this one as well. However, the difference between 8 MP and 6 isn't that great if the largest prints you want at 11x14 or 8x10. I can't see the difference and I've got a fairly critical eye. (I also disagree with a review in the San Francisco Chronicle this morning that said that the S5 (and S3) \"can't shake the digital look.\"I've been taking pictures since 1948 (a Kodak Brownie, what else?), and color since 1960. I've used three SLRs professionally, and I'll match the 6 and 8 MP with any 35mm I've used. How can a camera be rated as having a \"high quality lens\" have less than high quality pictures and still have a digital look ... although there is more noise with the S5 than the S3 IS.Five stars because it deserves it. The price of the S3 is/was much better, and I really don't have a preference because both have the 12x stabilized zoom, the feature I use most often. And the larger LCD is nice, but I use the viewfinder on both, the first I've had that works well with glasses.Neither camera is a point-and-shoot even in the auto setting. I do not recommend the camera to those who think they can pick it up and take pictures right away such as those that I and other experiences photo buffs have. If most of your pictures of people are missing heads or feet and you can't center anything on purpose, got to an Elph or Sony or a lower end Kodak.

I was so impressed that I bought it and haven't been disappointed. Takes a while to learn all the whistles and bells. Movie quality rivals my digital movie camera. When you read all the reviews talking about spherical aberration, etc. you have to think about what your realistic use will be. If you merely want to take higher quality pix without lugging around heavy lenses, I think this is a fine choice at about 1/3 the price of a digital SLR kit.You will read about the lens cap...yes, it falls off easily - also pops off when you turn the camera on, avoiding damage. A reasonable trade off. The high end rechargable batteries seem to be a must as it eats up the standard ones. Again, if you want convenience of being able to keep shooting when you are in the outback away from a recharger, but close to a kiosk, it is a reasonable trade off. My previous Canon elph is ~ 5 years old and still going. The image quality on this model is worth the upgrade for me and it is just more fun.

Set it to auto mode and have at it.  The results are great.  What is nice, is all the optional settings available for \"special\" situations when you are so inclined.I use the view finder most of the time and it is nice and bright. I wasn't that excited about the vari-angle display before getting the camera, but now I am happy to have it.  I like the idea that I can keep it \"closed\" to protect the screen from scratches and dirt during most of my shooting when using the view finder, yet use it for reviewing pictures and making menu changes.  I also like the large size and the quality of the display.The biggest surprise was the quality of the sound when using the movie mode.  It takes a nice quality video and is so simple to use.  Just push the dedicated button to start, then again to stop. (I have not found a way to \"pause\" the video, so each cycle created a new file.)  A big plus for the Canon is the ability to zoom while capturing the video.  This was the main selling point for me when trying do decide between the Canon and Panasonic.Finally, the camera has a good overall feel.  The button layout makes sense for the most part, and considering the complexity, it is fairly intuitive.Not so Good:This is one of the worst manuals for any product I have ever owned.  It is poor physically and poor in content.  The print is small and the icon images blur into the cheap paper.  The manual will instruct you to push a button by showing the button icon rather than naming the button.  Because of the poor print quality, it is hard to make out the image of the button.  Additionally, the starter guide booklet defines many of the button icons, but Cannon decided to save on a couple of sheets of paper and did not include this information in the main manual.  As for content, it is lacking.  The instructions basically show a setting, but there is little or no explanation as to what is happening or the cost associated with a particular option. Much of the manual consists of poorly laid out charts that are hard to understand.  Basically, the manual does not define terms and do not introduce concepts.  Anyone new to photography will have to find other sources that explain what is being discussed in the manual.  The saving grace is that the actual camera is well designed and relatively intuitive.  Use the manual as a starting guide, then experiment with the settings.  Film is cheap with a digital!  The software CD does not include a PDF file of the manual, but you can down load it from the Canon web site.The only problem I have had so far is that the date/time function has reset itself to zeroes on three occasions.  It appears to happen after I remove the SD card to transfer the files to my computer via a card reader.  What is strange is it does not happen all of the time.  I am trying to figure out the pattern.Other Comments:You can remove the trim ring off the front of the lens and add an adaptor tube for a teleconverter, wide angle, or filter lens.  Canon only shows 58mm accessories, but 52mm also works.  I went with the after market Lensmate Online adaptor in 52mm to keep the size down.  (If I weren't interested in small size and low weight, I would have bought a DSLR.)I sent Canon Support an e-mail question before buying.  They responded within a few hours.  They actually read my note in detail, then directly answered the question.  Amazing!  I called Panasonic with a simple product question, but they could not answer it.  They took my phone number with a promise to call back soon.  I am still waiting ........Many have complained about the battery cover and using this cover for the SD card storage.  I agree it is a dumb design, but I didn't find it to be a significant problem.What to buy???? Keep in mind that other manufacturers are coming out with 18X zoom factor cameras.  Olympus has the SP-550 (poor reviews) and announced the SP-560. Panasonic announced the FZ18.  I suspect Canon will have to respond.  It will be interesting to see if they replace the S5 in the near future or add an 18X zoom model in addition to the S5.  After some thought I decided the S5 12X met my needs and decided not to wait.  (I also considered a potential downside of a larger size lens, more weight, and lens design compromises.)As pointed out in many of the professional reviews, the downside of a super zoom point and shoot like the S5, compared to a DSLR, is more \"noise\" in low light situations, slower lens (f stop setting), and lack of optional lens.  However for most of us taking pictures of vacations, birthdays, camping trips, etc, these are non issues.  The S5 will meet most all of our requirements without the size, weight and cost of a DSLR. Don't get lost in the details of the reviews.In conclusion, I really like this camera!", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice camera - But don't trust the AUTO mode!", "Author": "NLee the Engineer", "ReviewID": "R1Z91Q4MQG317Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon S5 is a very capable camera, but there is one major caveat: You should NOT use the AUTO mode when shooting under dim light. This is beacuse the camera may automatically selects the highest 'film speed' of ISO=800. This will produce extremely noisy, grainy, or pixelated images. The same problem occurs in Sports mode as well.To avoid this problem, you should manually set ISO=200 or lower, then shoot in 'P' (Programmed mode) instead. Of course, now the exposure time is increased by 4x, so camera shake may be a problem even with image stabilization.If image quality under low light condition is critical to you, your best choice is to upgrade to a digital SLR.[The following section is for geeks only]:In order to explain the root cause of noisy images at high ISO, I have to tell you a secret: the so called 'film speed' for digital camera is a big scam. Unlike film camera world (where a film with higher ISO number means it has higher light sensitivity), the digital camera's optical sensor has a fixed sensitiviity. The signal amplitude from each pixel is proportional to the integral of light intensity and exposure time. To simulate a higher 'film speed' (from 200 to 400, for example), a digital camera simply reduces the exposure time by half (which means the signal amplitude from sensor is reduced by half), then crank up the gain by 2x afterwards. But since noise level from the sensor is fixed, the new signal-to-noise ratio is reduced by half. That is why images always become 'noisier' at higher ISO number.The problem with noisy images is made worse by the \"mega-pixel arms race\", where camera makers continue to cram more pixels onto the same sensor area. The old S1 has 3.2 mega-pixel on its 10mm by 7.5mm sensor. The new S5 has 8MP (2.5x more) in the same area. So the amount of light falling on each S5 pixel is only 40% that for the S1. The S1 can produce reasonably noise-free images at ISO=200. For the S5 sensor to produce the same signal strength, it needs 2.5X longer exposure time, which means ISO=80. That is why when you shoot the S5 at ISO=800, the noise problem is 10X worse compared to shooting the S1 at ISO=200.The only reliable way to improve signal-to-noise ratio is to increase sensor area. Professional DSLR typically have full-frame sensors (36x24mm, or 10x larger than the sensor in S5). Those can operate up to ISO=1600 or even 3200 and still produce almost noise-free images. Pro-sumer DSLR such as the Rebel XT have samller APS-C sensor (22.5x15mm, or 4x larger than the sensor in S5). So those can only operate satisfactorily up to ISO=800.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for this family of 5 (4.5 stars)", "Author": "gregg", "ReviewID": "R169KMKFDIVTIO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In short, we really love this camera.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  I will point out the pros and cons, but in sum, this is an excellent camera.  We have three toddlers and we take lots of pictures and video.  I am probably more than an average consumer with my picture and video editing, but I do not really think of myself as a hobbyist.  I just use Photoshop Elements (the consumer version of Photoshop) and Studio by Pinnacle for video.We purchased this camera to replace an almost 3 year old Canon Powershot A80.  It is an excellent camera and we decided to keep it as a backup.  The picture quality in the A80 is quite good, but we were looking for a larger zoom, some extra pixels for the occasional enlargements we do (I am no expert, but from all of the reviews I have learned that too many pixels can be a problem--plus our A80 only has 4 mega pixels and takes great pictures), and DVD quality video.  Any image improvements would only be a plus, since the A80 produces great pictures.Build QualityI read a lot of reviews and played with the camera at some local stores.  It feels nice, is substantial without being too heavy or big (though, it really is too big to be considered a \"point and shoot;\" it is too big for most pockets), and seems well built.  I read reviews on the Canon S3, which is very similar to the S5, but even though it was available at a good price since it is an earlier version, the layout of the buttons and the ease at which a button could be hit inadvertently (and thus ruin an image), plus the smaller video file capacity on the S3 led us to the S5.VideoOne of the big things for us was the ability to take DVD quality video with decent sound.  We really wanted to only have to carry one camera with us.  The S5 consistently was reviewed as excelling at this and I think the reviews were about right.  The video definitely is DVD quality and the sound is excellent, but our dedicated Panasonic digital video recorder takes a little better quality video.  I think to some extent, though, this is kind of like comparing two stereos or televisions at a store.  If you took either home you would be happy and probably forget the differences you saw or heard at the store.  What are the differences?  Basically, the S5 is a little more vulnerable to lower light video (like in a home or on a cloudy day).  Also, sometimes nearer objects may appear dimmer than farther away objects that have more light on them--like someone facing you, but not directly illuminated.  The dedicated digital video camera we have appears a little brighter in lower light situations.  The difference, though, is not that much.  And, you can work around it to some extent by being a bit more mindful of setting up your shot.  Also, moving the camera (i.e., panning from side to side) produces just noticeable choppiness compared with our Panasonic digital video camera.  Again, you can work around this by zooming out a bit and/or not quickly panning the camera around.  The zoom, by the way, is great and very quiet.  It works perfectly in video mode and I have not been able to hear any zoom motor in the videos we have made.  In the end, these are really fairly minor complaints re the video quality.  Technology is so powerful today that the differences between newer models of computers and cameras often is more nuanced than significant.  For our family of 3 young boys, the video is great and the ability to record straight to a flash card, which I then can zip right into our computer is super convenient (I use a cable and not a card reader--so the issue of the battery compartment holding the batteries and card is not an issue for us).Picture QualityThe picture quality is excellent, though so was our A80, so there was not much of an improvement, but that is really more of a compliment to how good Cannon optics are.  Plus, at this price level to be able to have a 12x optical zoom with image stabilization (i.e., more complicated electronics and glass) take such great pictures really is amazing.Lens capThe lens cap issue is real (it falls off far too easily).  This is one of those annoying design flaws that makes you scratch your head and wonder why such a great camera has to have an annoying fault.  Kind of like every rose has its thorn.  The issue can be corrected, though, with an extension adapter.  This allows you to add a UV lens (which really is just a lens protector) and later add a wide angle lens or additional zoom lens if you want to.  Like others, I chose the Lensmate adapter (52mm).  Lensmate was great to work with.  I ordered the adapter and a matching lens cap and it works perfectly (just note, when you receive the adapter and lens cap from Lensmate, it comes with no instructions or even receipt; luckily, the Cannon manual basically covers things--it assumes you purchased the Canon version of the adapter).ManualThe manual is not the best, but I was familiar with the A80 and the operation of the S5 is similar.  Plus, the camera is pretty intuitive to use.Battery LifeOur first batch of pictures used the included batteries from Canon.  They lasted for approximately 20 minutes of video, a little bit of playing around with the camera, and maybe 75 or so shots.  I now use rechargeable AAs and battery life is better than with the alkaline batteries, plus I can just recharge when I need to and always have the convenience of being able to get AA batteries pretty much anywhere.All in all, we are very happy.  I thought 5 stars was too much given the slight video issues I talked about and the lens cap annoyance.  4.5 seems about right.

The autofocus function works exceptionally well, the portrait mode is a breeze, the stability control function helps control for shake and the extra large LCD screen is a huge bonus.

The 12x zoom range has an amazing reach, equivalent to 36mm to 432mm (in a 35mm film camera).The controls on the camera are well laid out.  It is evident that Canon has learned from all previous models and they finally have things about right.  With the additional adapters it is possible to add ND filters or a tele-converter to give a top end of 950mm or more (Raynox 2020).For me the DSLR equipment load was just too much.  If your camera and lens cost so much you can't take them on vacation, they are worthless no matter how good the pictures might be.  With the S5 IS you get great pictures AND a camera you can afford to replace if it gets stolen or damaged.", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I wanted, minor gripes, FABULOUS photos!", "Author": "K.

I took 4 gigs of photos on my trip in every setting imaginable.I'll start with my only two gripes. First, this camera has THE WORSE lens cover I've ever seen. It pops off if it is barely touched. I have resorted to keeping it on with a rubber band. Second, the battery cover seems cheap and feels like it might break any minute. I open and close it VERRRRY carefully. So far, so good, but I'm amazed that a camera this great could have flaws as stupid as lens cap and battery door.WHAT I LOVE: This is my fourth digital camera.  GREAT clarity, even at huge distances. I took a couple hundred photos w/o flash or tripod at a choir concert, from at least 100 feet away. I got BEAUTIFUL close-ups of the people, no problem. Yes, it is a bit grainy, BUT SO IS HIGH SPEED FILM! Gosh, I can't believe the gripes in these reviews re: graininess at high ISO. The quality and clarity of these high digital ISO shots are far superior to anything I shot with film.GREAT CLOSE-UPS. This has macro and super-macro. I do a lot of plant photography. FABULOUS macro.FACE DETECTION: I didn't think I'd use this much but I love it.CHOICE OF SETTINGS: I use the \"Custom\" setting and can mess with it to my heart's desire, then save the settings. Wow. I love that. If you are an AUTO photographer I think you'll be happy with the auto setting too.GOOD MENUS: Menus are easy to use and intuitive. I especially like the +/- exposure access and the white balance settings.HEFTY FEEL: This feels like a substantial camera. It is easy to hold steady for a long shot or low-light shot.GOOD FLASH: I don't use flash much, but this is a good built-in one. I bought the Speedlite 220EX to go with it and found I don't really need it.AA BATTERIES: I bought a set of Sony AA rechargeables to go with this camera. I shot all day and never once ran out of juice with those batteries. I carried a spare set of single-use alkaline batteries and never used them.IMAGE STABILIZATION is incredible. At the last minute I decided against taking my tripod to China. Didn't ever need it, even in very low light. Even though the \"camera shake\" warning came on, I could still get good photos without blur if I held my breath!VIEWFINDER: I was SOOO glad to get away from having to look at a TV screen to frame my shots. This viewfinder is digital, but it looks like an SLR one, has adjustable diopter, and best of all, is great for bright situations when a little TV screen just doesn't show you what you need to see. I don't think I took a single photo using the viewscreen, but for editing and trashing at the end of the day, the big screen was a plus. The slideshow setting is a nice bonus.VIDEO: This isn't a video camera but in a pinch the video is fabulous! If I'd had bigger memory cards I would definitely have shot some video.If you want more than a point-and-shoot, love bells and whistles, and are willing to hassle with the lens cap, this is a great choice. I'm very happy with my purchase and expect to shoot thousands of great images with this camera.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "I smile after using it the first time dispite the flaws.", "Author": "Excalibur", "ReviewID": "R2QXM19XGG9091", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The longer I use it the happier I get. Unlike the S3 this is a real update of the S series camera. So many little changes were made that you are relearning things but overall made it a better camera.First thoughts after buying;1) The new lens cap is even worse. It seems like it pops off a lot easier then the S3.2) While the batteries are now easy to get in and out it is now harder to close the battery door.3) It is now heavy on the battery side. There must be more plastic this time, making it noticeably heavy when you hold it for the first time.4) The increased body size is enough that you will have to hold the S5 with your right hand differently form the S2 or S3.5) The button layout is easier to reach but are soft to push. There is not sensitive so you have to push hard to get a result.6) The menus have changed some, the ISO now comes up as a pop up menu you can go back and forth with so you do not have to cycle through the whole list to get the setting you want. Overall it is streamlined.The camera has had a overhaul. It is much more fitting the category of a prosumer camera then the versions that came before with the hot shoe and 2.5 LCD a long awaited addition. It still holds true to being a point and shoot by being simple to use and figure out. Two of its best selling points, AA batteries and a flip LCD are still there. More few more options have been added without taking away any of the previous ones.For S2 and S3 users who own the lens and batteries already and still want more out of their camera this is a great buy. The upgrade from the S3 is noticeable and more then the casual user will most likely make it worth the money.For a new user to the S series the 500 dollar starting price it is probably not be the best buy for you that amount of money. Once it drops in price then it would be in the right price range. Particularity for those who want the ability to choose their own settings and do not want the hassle of owning a SLR and multiple lenses.With the Panasonic FZ50 and Sony H9, Canon really should have done more to make the S5 standout from the competition and worth its high price tag.

So we're comparing it to something 3+ years old. I took some pictures at a graduation today; the distance that the camera can take quality pictures is limited just like any other digital camera. I prefer my film camera for pictures that will be further than 15 feet away. For close up shots I think it's a very nice camera. I'm still playing around with the white-balance feature. Most of the time on auto mode, it does well, but other times the photos looks slightly washed out. This is easily fixed by setting your white-balance.The only big flaw that I've found out so far, is that while recording a movie, you can take pictures...well the movie is interrupted to take a picture. You will be recording the movie, and when you click the button to take the picture, it stills the image, and makes a clicking sound from taking the picture. So you have a movie with pauses in it and clicking sounds for each still picture you've taken while shooting a movie. I was lead to believe that taking still images while recording, that there would be no pause in your movie. Maybe I don't know how to use this feature fully yet, or maybe it's just not possible to have non-interrupted movies and take pictures...As with my other canon camera and reading reviews of other people with canon cameras, the exposure level sometimes needs adjusted to get quality photos. You can't adjust the exposure settings while in auto mode which my wife would like. It doesn't bother me though because I'm usually in a custom mode.We haven't tried the hot shoe yet, but it was one of the reasons we got this camera as opposed to the S3. The face finder works great, and auto-focus seems to be very quick and accurate.I'm sorry for my thought jumping around from feature to feature, but I tried to hit all of out points of like and dislike without being too wordy...ENJOY!", "Date": "June 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera..BUT...Received Two Defective Units!

However, both the first camera and replacement camera I received had a defective sensor that would cause a small dark spot on the upper right quandrant of the picture in certain conditions.  Those conditions were whenever the aperture was in the range of f6 - f8 (small aperture).  This aperture setting would usually occur under bright conditions (auto) or manually set.  The spot looks like a dried water spot on the lens.  If you have this camera, check your pictures for this and test it yourself.  The spot may not be in the same area as mine, so look at the whole picture.  The easiest way to test yours is to point your camera against a light background, such as a blue sky, set the dial to Av, and set your f-stop to f-8.0.  Depress the shutter button half-way and look for a spot on your LCD.  Take a picture also, to confirm it shows up on the picture too.  In both cases my lens was completely clean.  I suspect that either there was a bad batch of sensors on the assembly line or these cameras that Amazon are selling were refurbished to some extent.

I read MANY of these reviews before purchasing, both on amazon and other sites. I also read reviews on other cameras. I finally made my purchase decision for the Cannon S5IS and I have no complaints. I read the chatter about pixel noise and this and that. And I'm sure that at the upper end of photography this is very important. But I'm your basic dad looking for good vacation and family photos. I'm looking for above average performance and flexibility with good value. This camera provides all of that. The price point can't be beat considering all the features. And the photos are great. They look awesome on my 20\" monitor and superb in 4x6 prints. Color rendition is excellent. My previous (cheaper) point & shoot cameras required virtually every picture to be color adjusted. This Canon looks great every time. I don't use any in-camera editing features as I find editing software sooo much easier. But even there I haven't needed to do much editing (except maybe to crop out my brother-in-law when he stuck his head into my shot of the Grand Canyon, but I digress).Features I like are the ease of going from full auto to full manual or anything in between. Manual controls are intuitive. I like the smart-rotation feature and flexible LCD screen. I love the 12x optical zoom, though I will agree that at the \"slow\" zoom speed it is a bit touchy and hard to get precise.All the complaints about the lens cap falling off are over-rated. Yes, it is not very secure, but I can't tell you how many times I turned it on with lens cap on. You will too. So I'm glad it pops off easy and doesn't strain the motor. In normal use and carrying around, I did not find a problem the cap spontaneously falling off. A few times. No big.I was a little concerned about 4AA battery life. I use rechargeables and I can report I got several hundred pictures before batteries died. So two  sets, one in camera and one charging, should be all you need. I will say one thing, the camera does not give much warning when batteries are nearly exhausted. The low-bat warning came on and like 2 shots later the camera turned off. So do keep those spares handy.Overall I am VERY happy with this camera. I tried several models out at a store, Sony, Nikon, etc. This one offered the most, cost the least and had the nicest feel.

However, if you take the time to experiment with different ISO settings and modes, you will learn what works to deliver absolutely amazing photos.Some hints:Auto settings will fail you unless you're taking shots in broad daylight with nothing to correct for.  I never use auto mode.Experiment.  Though it might seem counterintuitive, you can get great indoor moving shots with flash and an ISO of 100 to 200.  Want to get a great shot of your kids or pets indoors without blur?  I recommend shooting in AV mode with flash and an ISO setting of 100.  You will be pleased with the result.  Trying the same shot in auto will likely have you packing your S5 back into the box for return.  Like I said, it's not a great out-of-the-box camera, but it will delight the patient user.The color swap and color accent modes are amazing, they work in just about any setting, and you'll love the results.  It's a very fun feature to play with, especially if you're just starting out.Be patient with your S5.  It really is a fabulous camera if you take the time to get to know it.  It truly is worth looking through the instruction manual or checking out a how-to on YouTube.I've seen reviews debate whether the S5 is a good bridge between your typical point and shoot and an SLR.  You'll find conflicting opinions, but personally, I think it's great.  To use this camera, you'll have to learn about settings, ISOs and so forth, and this can only serve you well with the SLR later on when you decide you're ready.One of my favorite features is the one-touch video.  You won't miss a great clip because you're fumbling with settings, you merely push a button and it begins recording!  When you're done, you can go right back to snapping photos.  I think Canon really knew what they were doing here.More megapixels on a point and shoot camera doesn't deliver better image quality.  To accomplish this, the camera would also need a bigger sensor.  Too many megapixels can equate to noisy or grainy images without a corresponding larger sensor.  Don't be fooled.  Unless you're printing photos larger than an 8x10, a 6MP will do everything you need it to.  And frankly, without an SLR, most enlargements beyond 8x10 are going to look noisy anyhow.If you're deciding between the S3 and the S5, don't let the megapixels decide for you.  The only real difference in my opinion is the larger LCD screen on the S5.  It's pretty huge as far as digital camera LCDs go, which gives you a better idea of how the photo will print, so it's nice for that reason.  Still, the S3 has a decent size display for this purpose and it's a lot cheaper.  Really it depends on how much a big LCD means to you.It is a pretty solid camera.  Some people think it's bulky and prefer a lighter, thinner camera.  Personally, when I'm holding a camera, I want to feel like I'm holding a good piece of equipment, and the S5 delivers.PROS:With a vast array of shooting modes and ISO settings, you can get some absolutely amazing photos out of this camera.Startup time from \"ON\" to capture is very fast.Photo capture responds very fast.With features like color swap and color accent, you can be really creative and create beautiful professional-looking photos right out of your camera.One-click video recording.Uses SD cards - cheaper and easier to find than XD.Uses four AA batteries and you can get a LOT of life out of these.  Nice thing about AAs is that if you run out or forget yours, you can get a pack anywhere.  The S5 uses FOUR of them, but they do last a good long while.Video clarity is great, even in settings where bright light is not available.  With my previous digital camera, indoor videos were mostly impossible without direct blazing sunlight coming through a window.CONS:Not a good out-of-the-box camera, requires knowledge of ISO and modes.High ISO = image noise and grainy photos.If you don't learn your settings, you can end up with some seriously blurred images.The batteries and SD card share a space, which I'm not so thrilled about.  Mostly this is because the door is a bit flimsy and awkward to open and close.Lens cap pops off and is prone to getting lost unless you attach it to the camera.Bottom line, there are really only two reasons you would be disappointed with the S5 and they are:1. You're looking for the kind of quality that only a professional DSLR can offer (in which case I would recommend the Nikon D60) or2. You want a camera that you don't have to do anything with in terms of learning about shooting modes and ISO settings.

I was shooting wildlife, but had set the image stabilizer on \"continuous\" instead of \"Shooting\".  It made a major difference.  Set it only to work when the shutter button is focused half way, so you will get better long range stability.  I agree fully with other reviews about the newly designed battery/memory card door.  It is stupid and difficult to close, and probably will break. It's a real design flaw.  I am really glad to be able to use 4 gig and higher cards now.  I use these cameras for video at times, and the larger card handles the load (FYI, video eats memory like crazy).  Also, the S5 has two extra megapixels (8) for better resolution whereas the S3 has only 6. And finally, it's a great camera to pack around when you don't want to take the higher end stuff along. All in all, I am very pleased with the upgrade but knocked it to 4 stars because of the battery door.  So, how do you move up to the next \"S\" model every year? Simple.

Combining its higher ISO and anti-shake technology allows clear photos without flash in situations that formerly required flash and still came out dark; the 12X optical (plus 8 MP) allows quality total magnification of 36X.

The S5, despite it's mini-DSLR style, is still a point 'n shoot camera, albeit one that is of very high build quality and loaded with features.  Major shortcomings first: images are noisier than in some competitors down to ISO 100. This is, frankly, unexpected at this price and in this brand. Start-up and shot-to-shot recycling times are still on the slightly slow side. Expect to miss a lot of critical moments as you would with any other point 'n shooter. The camera is a bit on the heavy side, though this is consistent with the build quality (I think) and the use of AA batteries. On the whole, not a long list and nothing serious.  On the plus side, there several features I consider outstanding and unique. The video quality (with stereo microphones) is nothing less than astounding. A friend of mine has been making videos for YouTube of music club performances, handheld with harsh club lighting and they are surprisingly good. I have been very impressed with the videos I've made under a variety of conditions. I suspect many people like having a video capability in their still camera. I know I do and appreciate that I don't have to carry a separate device. The zoom range is terrific, the Image Stabilization (IS) works while in video mode, which is very welcome and very important and you can zoom while in video mode. All in all, if you appreciate having a video capability, a good reason to buy the camera.  The Canon LCD display can be set in many positions, with its unique hinging system. You can hold the camera overhead or ground level. You can flip it over for use as a monitor when doing photos or videos of yourself. (A particularly handy gadget to use when you're on vacation or otherwise want to include yourself in images is the Quik Pod Pro-Plus Extendable Handheld Tripod (18-inch) with Accessory Kit - for Canon Powershot, Casio, Epson, Fuji Finepix, HP, Kodak Easyshare, Minolta, Nikon Coolpix, Olympus Stylus, Panasonic, Pentax Optio & Sony Cybershot Digital Point & Shoot Cameras.) There is also an optical viewfinder. I find this combination in many Canon cameras an unbeatable feature.  There is, unusually for a camera of this class, a hotshoe for external flashes. Adding an external flash will provide tremendous improvement to the range and versatility of your camera in almost all photographic situations. Ever wonder why the pros always use and external flash? It's because it helps them turn out better photos. Even a low power external flash will work wonders and the S5 is one of the few cameras in this range to permit you to use one.  The S5 uses AA batteries. Many will argue that this is an old-fashioned approach. Not me. On too many occasions (one is actually one too many), I have had run out of juice with lithium ion battery powered cameras. Nothing is more frustrating then a camera that is without power. AA batteries are available worldwide, are relatively inexpensive and relatively lightweight. Again, I consider the use of AA batteries in the S5 to be an advantage and a reason to buy the camera. A set will last for 150 -200 shots.  In terms of general features, image quality is excellent, with ISO available up to 1600. Noise starts at ISO 100 and becomes progressively worse at higher ISOs. This is normal for this kind of camera.  Color rendition is excellent. I haven't yet notice any purple fringing which is relatively common in cameras of this kind.  There are more than 20 pre-set shooting parameters, more frankly than you will ever be likely to use or even remember. There is - bless Canon - full manual control available. This is a real camera!  The controls are well laid out and, even with my large hands, I had no difficulty manipulating any of the controls. Menus are intelligently done and easy to navigate. There is a separate button for video which is a nice, but necessary, touch.  Focus at all ranges is pretty quick, though I have encountered some occasional hunting.  Lens range is typical for a 12x. Be nicer if the bottom end were the equivalent of a 28mm, not 35mm.  There is competition in this price and feature range. Panasonic offers the Lumix FZ18 which offers an 18x zoom with a 28mm equivalent bottom range. It is worth considering, but lacks the Canon swivel display and video zoom capabilities.  Overall the Canon S5 is an undeniably fine camera for its price range. It is absolutely not a DSLR and anyone wanting the feel of a traditional 35mm SLR and the ability to grab instant pictures should seriously consider spending far more and buying a DSLR. Within its limitations, however, the Canon S5, in my opinion, sits at the top of its class and should be seriously considered.Jerry", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Exected more", "Author": "David A.

My $200 Sony does better in this category.  Maybe a quarter of the indoor photos we took were slightly out of focus.  That's hard to forgive, but unforgiveable is the flash.

The problem is most people who call themselves serious amateur photographers aren't. My travels have taken me to many parts of the world, and wherever I go I see amateur photographers struggling  with their Nikon D80s, or, sadly enough, D3s and D200s. Often by the time they are set, they have lost the shot. The fact is a camera like the Cannon S5 IS is enough camera for most amateurs. Indeed, if you want a camera with a good telephoto range, the ability to quickly adjust shutter speed (up to 1/3500), aperture, and ISO, this camera may be for you.  One of the premier features of the S5 IS is the image stabilization (I.S.)function. Some reviews have criticized the I.S., because it creates blurry photographs. However, if the I.S. is set to single shot, instead of continuous shooting, not only is blur not a problem, but the I.S. is a great tool for creating crisp telephoto and windy condition photographs. Note: the continuous shooting modes (and there are several) are very easy to use.  Further, switching to digital movie mode is only a matter of pushing a single button. The movie images are equal to any digital movie camera. Canon could not have made it any easier to use.  The digital zoom and macro functions are more than enough for most amateurs. Indeed, when digital zoom and optical zoom are combined the camera has an incredible focal length of 36-1728 mm.  Amateurs who are new to the digital world will appreciate the ease of operation. If all you ever do is point and shoot, this camera will satisfy that need, while providing the photographic quality and focal length of much more expensive cameras.  For camera snobs, and probably very few of them are still reading, I am sure I have done little to dissuade you from your secret fantasy of one day owning a D3. But for people who have a nice photographic eye, love to frame the world through a lense, but know the offer from National Geographic will probably not be coming anytime soon, this camera is worth considering.", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love the camera", "Author": "Ronald Byrd", "ReviewID": "R1QI5M8VYNIJ4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the S5 about a month ago to use for a trip to Africa. I'm an amature who takes lots of pictures of family and travel sites, having used other compact and subcompact digital cameras before. I've used my new S5 frequently in the first few weeks and have been impressed with it's easy of use, breath of features and quality of pictures.The zoom works very well including the digital zoom giving a 48x view. The zoom bar in the viewer tells you when the digital zoom is starting to degrade the quality of the picture, a nice feature.The S5 takes great video: With the large capacity memory chips one can take a couple of hours! of video. You can choose the quality of video, there is a separate video button so you can start/stop quickly and you can zoom while in video mode, something I haven't seen on other digital cameras.The articulated display is a nice feature, both to protect the screen when not in use and to orient it anyway you want.The batteries seem to last a long time.This camera is packed with lots of functions, things you can change and display options (including a live histogram)that I'm still learning to us. But its very well designed all around: layout of buttons, depth of options, layout of display information, 'feel' of camera in you hands.Also, there are over a dozen, what I call, picture content pre-sets like landscape, portrait, sports and even one for fireworks, which I had a chance to try and got good results.My one minor complaint is the flash doesn't automatically pop open when needed, you manually have to open it.As you can see, I'm really pleased with the purchase. I'd recommend you take the time to study the manual to take advantage of all it's feature.

I was concerned about both the possible theft of my Nikon film cameras, which I would normally take, and about airport x-rays. In the end, after a great deal of research, I selected this camera. I was not disappointed.Here are the positives for this camera:. Size and weight; truly carrying a larger and heavier camera would have been tough on this trip. This little camera tucks nicely inside a jacket or vest.. I found that shooting in manual or in aperture priority gave me all I needed. I have no problem enlarging to 12x16 with good results.. The multiple shooting modes will appeal to many casual photographers. The movie mode works very well, and, as a bonus, eliminates the \"video camera fee\" charged at many sites in India..  For travelling, I like a camera that takes AA batteries, which can be found everywhere. Special lithium cells are hard to find in many countries. This alone eliminated other cameras from consideration..  Nice lens; it outdid the \"street\" zoom on my daughter's Nikon D80. I did however add an auxiliary wide angle, since the bottom end of the zoom range is lacking.. The variable screen is brilliant - it allows those floor level and over-the-crowd shots to be composed with ease. This was another deal maker for me. A plus here is that this rear screen can be protected by turning it into the camera body where nothing can get to it, like zippers or buttons. This proved invaluable when thrashing through the Nepalese jungle or banging around on elephants. I would have purchased the Canon G9 if it had this feature.Negatives:. Lack of RAW format will drive some people nuts. I would have liked to use RAW but heh, it's not a pro camera.. The battery/card slot was poorly thought out. A separate slot for the memory card would have been nice.. There is some blue fringing at the extreme end of the zoom range. You would need high magnification to see it. In the end, Photoshop can take care of it.* I did not use the software since I have other applications that I use regularly.So why did it not get 5 stars: principally because the zoom range is not short enough in the wide angle department. Secondly, the battery/memory card compartment could have been better designed. Removing the card always seems to involve mucking around with the batteries. Truthfully it deserves 4.5 stars, were this allowed.I have no hesitation in recommending this camera to my friends as a great all around shooter that will perform beyond the average point-and-shoot.

Without removing the camera from your eye, you can easily go into playback mode and zoom and pan the picture you just took, and then go back into record mode.o The anti-shake works and the camera is light, so I can take 12x pictures with confidence without a tripod.o Movie mode button lets you switch from taking a picture to taking a movie. May not sound like much, but when you're looking through the viewfinder and some action catches your eye, you don't have to lower the camera, rotate a knob to movie mode, and find the subject again.o Flip-out rotating LCD display lets me hold the camera as high as I can reach and take pictures of, for example, my family eating dinner at a restaurant.o Fun to use.

The problem was due to Canon's CCD fault so even though it was out of warranty, they were to repair it.  But no parts to repair, so they gave me the equivalent line of model which is now the S5. I didn't even have to pay shipping returning the unit! Talk about amazing customer service.  What other company would do this?  This factor alone suggests that one should not just look into price/features but also that of the reputation for customer service with the company.  Canon is at the top!As for the camera itself, I'm just floored since going from the S1 to S5 is a huge difference.  The basic shape remains the same, which I just love.  The flipping LCD means so much to me since I can take self portraits all the time.  The larger LCD allows for increased resolution and it shows!  The old S1 had a tiny 1.5\" screen that made it impossible to really get details in the shot.Lens cover -- same as the S1, it's hard to put on.  BUT there's a reason for this.  You can screw on an extension lens body.  If they made the lens cover integrated this feat would be difficult to offer.  I prefer the ability to add a wide angle lens to the unit.Video quality -- Truly the best out there for a consumer camera. Some criticize the lack of onboard compression.  Well, I'm glad there isn't any.  Compression makes the video look horrible.  Witness that on other cameras out there that offer so-called 640x480 30fps with quicktime or whatever.  Looks fugly when you view it with pixelation and jerkyness in high speed action.  Not the case with the S5 where video is as smooth as from a camcorder.Quality of the photos -- this is definitely no SLR.  ISO 80/100 should be the main shooting speed.  ISO 400/800 should only be used in cases where you either have a choice of NO shot or a shot at all -- they will be noisy but at least you'll have something.  The high zoom makes this particularly true for action shots.  Honestly, let's be real here.  You're next step for a high ISO with image stabilized high zoom on an SLR is going to cost you thousands of dollars just for the lens body itself!  I'll happily take the noise over the cost savings.Scene modes -- so many features, so many settings.  But it's actually pretty logically laid out for you.  Each setting will print the words so you no longer have to guess what the heck \"TV\" mode is (and it's not for television!).Dislikes from the S1 -- very upset that the SD card slot is integrated under the battery cover. What were they thinking?  It's moronic to say the least.  I'm always afraid the battery cover latch will break off years ahead.  Anyhow, I would suggest people to purchase an 8GB SDHC card to remedy this situation.  Use a very large card so you don't have to swap out the memory card.  8GB is very cheap now, around $50.  Don't buy little 1GB cards due to this issue.Overall, I'm looking forward to using my S5 for years to come.", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "GOOD CAMERA OVERALL", "Author": "D. W.

It had been a long time since I'd had a holiday and even longer since I'd been to the USA. This time I wanted to do a few things more, especially since I was going for 5 weeks. A new camera was a must as my old and much loved first digital camera, a Fuji S300 has dust on its sensor and was a little annoying due to shutter lag, plus nearly everything needed colour correction on the computer. Nevertheless it had taken excellent pictures many of which are on the walls of our current home. I thought by now it would be easy to replace this with a dSLR, I used to use an OM1 (film SLR) with a nice heavy zoom lens. There were some excellent bargains in the shops, or so I thought until I started looking closer. The choice last year seemed very much to be Nikon D40 or D40X or Canon EOS 400D. Then again the Olympus E410 & 510 had just arrived. Had the E510 been cheaper I would have bought that but being new it had not yet reached its discount levels so I hesitated.Eventually I bought this camera last August. This seemed to be the most recommended ultra zoom, with reservations from some reviewers. Mine was made in Japan which I like but at the price last August it needed to be! I find it works very nicely especially the video with full stereo sound! I have to date taken some 7566 pictures; some just practise shots, some discarded and many of the rest avi's. If I have any complaints about it they are these:Batteries, I have destroyed a fair number of NiMh rechargeables or at least the camera and a quick charger have. In fact due to batteries and charger problems or rather the batteries not lasting 5 minutes in the camera I started on an updated hunt to replace it, again with a dSLR - plenty of new ones to choose from! Whilst hunting I came across recommendations and bought a pack of 4 Duracell Japan AA's and then came across a bargain 4 hour charger. This combination seems to have solved battery issues albeit at a price. It's still good though to have 4 Alkaline AA in your pack and use those when in need. Good batteries however last a long time - days of hard use but that's how you eventually destroy the less than top draw ones it seems!Wide angle is issue 2. Whilst in New York I needed it, how else can you snap the glorious buildings? I popped into a store just off Times Square (where you are supposed not to shop) and picked up a fish eye/wide angle for a couple of hundred US$. That felt expensive at the time but Canon had not yet got their act together with supplies of this much needed item. It turns out the quality was pretty good as long as you don't forget to take it off when you go telephoto that is. I became a quick hand at slipping it on and off, only dropping it twice (dented the lens hood but nothing else!)  So if you photograph buildings or similar with wide angle lens this camera may not suit you and a $200 upgrade could buy you something with a wider angle.Issue 3 is the lens cap dropping off but if you have a wide angle I keep that on mostly and had both lens caps on the thread for use in field - also I use black electricians tape (PVC, what we used to call insulating tape). I had needed that as the only converters anyone had last year were for the S2 which had a slightly different fitting so I used the tape to stop the tube moving in the mount (it clicked in but ...). I recently tried a really cheap teleconverter (2x) it didn't work too well, focus and f stop wise, however it showed me that I would gain very little from buying the quality Canon one (1.6x). I now use the lens tube for the wide angle since it was made for the S5. I have a polarizing filter but haven't found the need for it yet - when next on Sydney harbor perhaps.Issue 4 is non issue in some ways - video is so good on this camera I defaulted to using it (just pressed that red button) as soon as there was something interesting, so ended up with great avi's but hardly any decent stills, although you can scavenge those from the avi in the software but the pixel count is of course lower! The issue is that I feel I haven't achieved my previous standard i.e. when using the Fuji or OM1 and predecessors.Issue 5 there is some noise around but never having had the S3 at 6mp I suspect it won't bother most people very often, though I worked in summer mostly and here when it's sunny. On grey overcast days maybe, though indoors with or without flash it never seems to be that bad.Pluses:Hard working, great pictures, excellent video and frankly until recently I never used anything except auto, it doesn't need it. Here are some things that I wouldn't be without from Canon anyway, a DIGIC III processor which I suspect accounts for colour and exposure control (Canon use it in the EOS40D & the EOS 450D), IS (image stabilization), scene modes especially foliage, ISO range from 60, yes folks 60 not 200 as some dSLR's (e.g. Alpha 700), preferably live view and naturally @100%, tilting and rotating LCD screen (both the latter mean overpriced Olympus E3), diopter adjustment on the viewfinder, SD cards for storage (now I have them that is, I have 2x4 gb, 3x2 gb, ah not E3 - uhm you know the problem or else you wouldn't be reading this).I have tried exposure bracketing and focus bracketing the latter was unnecessary and the exposure gave some slight improvements at a 1/3rd less but nothing to worry about in the incandescence of a normal sunny Australian day! Will try in less ideal conditions.Vivid colour I like to play with though it often turns our roads blue (set it for custom mode). You can also shoot B7W or even black & white, sepia or colour accent but I haven't explored those much yet.To say that in looking for a new camera whilst this one still isn't broke was perhaps foolish is true but it has lead me to better understand what this camera will do. I compared same time location shots from the S5 IS with those from a EOS400D with the kit short zoom lens and my picture quality won out (Digic III processor, I suspect, it couldn't be the small sensor - but perhaps the lens). See TrustedReviews.com thoughts on the S5 IS and compare his Exeter Cathedral shots, I preferred the S5 to the EOS40D though that might just have been the weather.Recommendation - don't ditch the manuals but do get \"A Short Course in Canon Powershot S5 IS Photography\" from Amazon or [...] Shortcourses.com. At US$29.95 online it's a steal (you'll find out things you never noticed in the advanced users manual, especially on P, Tv, Av mode use. There are 2 typos, one is calling the sensor CMOS, it says in the said manual CCD, the other is an unfinished unimportant sentence, but hey he's probably like the most of us, married & interrupted when composing!). Also download a manual from Canon then you can print out the excellent list of features at the back of the advanced version - take that with you just in case you find auto doesn't do it for you - I even used auto for night photography in New York!On balance I might even replace this with another S5 IS if the untoward happens! Oh and if you think you will buy an EOS450D they'll share a flash unit but I haven't needed it and look at the prices Canon want for them - could buy a competitors dSLR at the same price as the 580 flash unit.PS - if you are reading Canon I very nearly snapped up a Samsung GX10 for the price of a Nikon D40, half of the price of the EOS450 all with a kit kens, the GX10 & D40 probably have better than your basic kit lens.ENJOY!", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Can be use both as camera and camcorder", "Author": "G.

I got some way cool fireworks shots and Christmas light shots at night.Concerning the image stabilization with the 12x zoom, I never sought big zooms so I never thought how nice they could be. After using the S5 and it's 12x zoom with IS, I gotta say, it's great! Being able to zoom in on subjects from afar and get a non-blurry shot...it just works, AND, by doing so, I find the focal length changes so that you get better portrait shots e.g. the subject is in focus with the background all blurry like the pros do. So nice.

When recording video, you can indeed take full size shots. When you do, the video recording freezes for a second, and when you play the video back, you will see the video freeze for about a second then also, but unless you're actually shooting a movie or a wedding this should not be a problem. I'm even impressed with the built in video editing features. It actually saves some time and makes it easier to edit or compress video later in Adobe Premiere Elements. I have found that short 30 second video clips on the S5 can go from the camera straight to Blogger online for uploading and without having to first compress the file myself, and the resulting quality online is great. Very pleased there.The screen - It is indeed crisp and colorful and large. You can shoot and playback with ease. The stills and video show up beautifully.My only negative is that the pictures in auto mode indoors without a flash can be a bit grainy, thus the 4 star rating. I attribute that to the 8MP. I think if it were a 6MP it'd be 5 star perfection.Lens cap pop off - It does come off easily, but it don't bother me none. I like that it takes out the risk of damaging the lens motor like if you turn on the S5 with the cap still stuck on there.Battery/Card door difficult - Non-issue. After the 3rd or 4th time opening and closing the door, you figure out how it works just fine. Just push down with your thumb right and start taking pictures.Give me a week in the West Texas mountains with this S5 and I'll print you a new photo book!This top of the line P&S; does it all, and beautifully.

If you turn the camera on with the lens cap still on, it will shoot it off, but that's not the camera's fault.  The battery door is on the flimsy side, but it's the same as it is on my A80 and I've never had a problem with it.

I just wasn't ready to put 1,000 to 1,500 into an Slr Camera, so we went on this one, based on the reviews and a friend using this camera indoors with good result.My last Digital camera is A small sony cybershot. Not bad for the price, but not great in low lighting and indoor lighting can be touchy with yellowish pictures. Great shutter lag time. I got a lot of really good pics from the camera. But I would try to take pics of my husbands small band indoors and my kids showing animals at the county fair indoors and they weren't great pictures.So I used my new canon this summer at the fair and I got a lot of great pictures to choose from and I also used it sitting in the audience while my husband's small band played ina town hall and I also got much better pictures than my sony every gave me.I am using the energizer Lithium E2 rechargable batteries, and they last forever.I purchased a SanDisk Ultra II memory card 1GB Holds something like 600pics at the 8 mega pixal setting. There is a difference in quality of memory cards. We shopped for ours at circut city to get adice.I load my pictures onto my computer using my HP printer slots. A little slow, but I have windows 98, and the program that came with the camera wont work on my computer.It takes a little while to get used to what setting you have the camera in and when the flash will and won't work, Like in sport setting the flash doesn't come on at all, so you have to change the camera to automatic or to portrait setting, or indoor setting.The zoom is nice, but can get grainer and shaky the more you zoom in on something and even the manual recommends a tripod when using a lot of zoom. So some of my indoor pics of the kids showing did come out grainy, when the lighting wasn't real bright in the barns. But they were way better than my sony cybershot.I have been using the camera for about 3 months no. So far no problems. I am very happy with it.My husband used the video camera part for work and loaded it on his powerpoint presentation and he said it turned out nicely and he didn't really now much about the camera when he did it.

Yes it's loaded with adjustable features and a great zooming video mode, but what good are all these bells and whistles if the pictures don't look that good even at the lower ISO settings. To make things worse, my LCD has a stuck blue pixel and the camera's CCD has 2 stuck pixels which I easily noticed in darker pictures while pixel peeping. One stuck pixel is blue and is easily noticeable for me now as I know exactly where it is located in all the pictures. It stands out like a sore thumb. The other stuck pixel happens to be white and it not as noticeable if the pictures are bright, but it is still there in all pics. I did this dead pixel test by shooting in complete darkness. The 2 stuck pixels are evident on every single picture including ISO 80 and much more pronounced at ISO 400 and above. Unfortunately, this camera is going back to Amazon.

The \"typical\" current price of the S5 IS camera is $[...] but many places are now selling it for $[...]. I got mine at Circuit City (local) for that price.This camera does extremely well right out of the box, but with just a little tweaking (as in, \"read the manual\" or purchase a digital photography book) it produces outstanding photographs! I bought this book Canon PowerShot Digital Field Guide, which is a good general reference with specific information about this camera as well.I also purchased the lens adapter set, which amazon has for a great price Canon LAH-DC20 Conversion Lens Adapter (LA-DC58E) and Hood (LH-DC40) Set for the S5 IS, S3 IS & S2 IS Digital Camera and Hoya HMC UV and circular polarizer filters Hoya HMC - Filter - circular polarizer - 58 mm. These work great and do not add much bulk to the camera. Your zoom mechanism is well-protected as is your lens if you add the lens adapter and a filter and keep it on at all times (I keep the UV filter on at all times).Furthermore, you can get additional \"converter lenses\" that attach to the adapter (personally I do not think you need them, but they are available for this camera)--these include the telephoto converter (as if 12x optical were not enough!), the wide-angle converter, and the macro lenses (again, as if the camera's macro and super macro weren't enough!). Amazon just happens to have very good prices on these accessories Canon TC-DC58B Tele Converter Lens for S5 IS, S3 IS & S2 IS Digital Camera. Canon Powershots have, as a rule, won many awards for image quality and the Canon brand typically comes out on top when this is the major criterion. As far as I am concerned, these additional lenses are just icing on the cake.Additional considerations:(1) Being a Canon, it connects directly to my Canon PIXMA printer for incredible prints.(2) Some reviewers' star ratings are lowered because the \"lens cap comes off easily.\" I do not think this is a major flaw--I think this is to protect the camera's automatic lens extension mechanism when you turn on the camera. If you turn on the camera and the lens cap is still on, it will pop off when the lens extends. This is a safety feature. If you really can't stand it, just get the adapter and UV filter and put a new 58mm lens cap on the filter (it will not pop off nor does it need to, because the lens extends within the adapter tube) and you are all set. Alternatively, just get a new lens cap if you will never forget to take it off prior to turning on the camera.(3) This camera is out of stock from many vendors. I think the S6 is going to come out soon. However, it will probably be several hundred dollars more. I would get the S5 while it is still available, especially at this price (price has dropped about $150-$170 dollars since it came out in 2007).What about the G9? Well, I chose this over the G9 because I prefer the 12x zoom and 8 megapixel combination for my personal picture-taking needs. 8 megapixels is plenty for me and in my opinion additional megapixels add more time for saving the picture and also add a bit of noise on the point-and-shoots. The G9 shoots in RAW but I don't need that when the images I get are so uniformly excellent (they do not need a lot of editing). The G9 does have an optical viewfinder (the S5 has a digital viewfinder that is 100% accurate, unlike some cameras, but it low resolution, which is annoying at first but does not affect the quality of the pictures). The G9 does not have the swing-out LCD screen. This feature is very useful as it can be turned/rotated toward the camera and the screen is protected when not in use, and the screen can also can be turned a tilted for hard-to-get shots at graduations, with pets, etc. where you can't aim the camera directly.I think the best way to decide about this camera is to go to the flickr users' group (one of them, there are several) and look at the pictures that people have taken with this camera. The url is [...] and you can see not only photos people (even newbies) have uploaded, but also read discussions about this camera. You might find this thread of particular interest: [...]I am a person who usually experiences \"post-decision regret\" (\"shoulda, coulda, woulda. . .\") but I am completely satisfied with this camera. I originally wanted the Canon EOS 40D (DSLR) but got this one due to price (and they actually share much of the same technology). Now I even think this was the better choice for me overall (regardless of price) due to its compact size and the fact that I can take it everywhere with me. Even when I am driving I can just hold up this camera and snap it and get terrific pictures of scenery that catches my fancy (optical stabilization is fabulous).This is just about the most perfect combination of features and image quality I can imagine. You do not need more megapixels. You do not need more zoom. You do not need RAW. You do not need a DSLR (if you did you would not be reading this). You need to get this camera for yourself before it is out of stock everywhere. Buy it. You will NOT be sorry![I do NOT work for Canon nor does anyone in my family! I usually do not write reviews.

I only know to try to adjust the exposure value.I only bought it the day before leaving for a amsterdam/belgium vacation. It was very easy to use (having not read the manual).

The camera was fast and responsive, took good pictures, and the auto focus was good in most cases.I've since taken around 3000 pictures with it, and I'm pretty nitpicky about the image quality.  My favorite type of scene is mountain type scenary, and these all tend to come out perfectly.  Even while zoomed in all the way, I've yet to have a problem.The complaints that are here about image noise are usually able to be fixed by adjusting the camera.  I've found ISO 400 or higher is worthless unless the light is low.  I took an 8 second explosure at ISO 400 with infinity focus of the constellation Orion, and there was still virtually no noise because there wasn't any background signal (from the sky.)Generally, I leave the camera on the \"P\" dial, forcing ISO of 80 or 100.  This effectivly removes the noise by increasing the shutter.  Since I tend to take professional quality pictures (even being just a hobby) I always have a tripod with me.  If the camera ever wants 1/30th or slower shutter at such a low ISO I just stick it on the tripod.Make no mistake, the camera could have a better sensor or maybe better image filtering, but there is nothing about this camera that can be worked around to obtain near perfect images.  Considering the price is half what a decent true DSLR is, you get your money's worth and then some.Just don't expect perfect images taken in the dark without external stabilization.

I did compare many cameras in the same class (the Panisonic and Olympus super zoom models) but I ultimately decided on this one for several reasons.One all the pros agreed that this takes better quality pictures than the others.  While the optical zoom is not as great as the other super-zooms, I chose quality over function in this area- including the absence of RAW  (I am an amateur do I really need that? No I want quick photos at decent quality and jpeg gives that).  If you keep the pic size at the medium to small sizes with super fine detail they do look really good (I admit at the largest size they do become grainy- see other review of super zooms for why).Two, the fact that it takes regular AA batteries was a huge plus.  You can find them anywhere and with a decent case you can bring enough batteries to keep you shooting all day if need be (e.g. when on vacation).Three, this camera allows you to use the zoom while capturing videos.So that was why I bought this camera but how does it perform?Well I waited a few weeks after getting it to come to a conclusion.  After attending some sporting events, taking pics outside and inside I can say that I am a satisfied customer (not to mention that you can get this camera cheap now with multiple accessories).Although the pics meet my expectations the video capture far exceeds what I expected.  I have a Canon miniDV camcorder and I doubt I will be using that much anymore.  The quality of the video as well as the sound is amazing.  I went to an Ohio State BBall game and the music was supper loud, yet when I went to replay the video the audio was not distorted at all!!!  I was so surprised that the bass did not cause distortion.Overall for amateurs this is a solid buy ($325) if you want more than a simple point and shoot but less than an expensive SRL.  I would suggest getting the lens adapter and hood (which are cheap) as well as a UV 58mm filter (also cheap) and the Canon Ultrasonic Lens Cap (the one included does suck).  Both will protect your camera's lens as well as give you options for the future.  I would keep in mind that my rating is based on an amateur's perspective and not a professional.

The 4 AA batteries give you security knowing that you can get replacements almost anywhere. I like the viewing screen, it's big and can be moved to the back or the side whatever you wish. The SD card is in the bottom of the camera with the batteries and is very easy to replace as are the batteries. The 12x zoom is nice if you are a peeping tom, but Canon should have given a wider wide angle zoom if you like to shoot groups of people.  The 32kb SD card is too small except for cleaning your teeth and a 2MB SD card will give you plenty of room without worrying about filling the card.

I used Canon A-1s up till a Year Ago, Could No longer Buy the Film I use ,So I Bought a Canon D-20 , its a Great Camera, I Do things with Digital I Couldnt Get Away with on Film ,But its a Big Camera and sometimes , I dont Feel Like Loading all the Gear . Camera Bag , Lens and so Forth , thats were this Camera Comes in ! The Reason I Bought this was so I can Always Have a Camera on Me at All Times , The Best Shots Always Happen When You Dont Have A Camera on You! Happens Everytime !Now I Have seen some People Saying this or that , You have to look at the Facts , 1st it is What it is , Meaning its in between  A Point and Shoot And A SLR Camera , there is a Trade off for Everything , Here You Get Alot of Camera in A small package .Some Examples of this , It has a Manual Mode , I use this Just Like A 35mm Film Camera , I love that and You can Set the ISO like on a Film Camera , Now also the Lens is Equal to Lens from 36mm to 432mm ! This gives You A Wide Angle Lens 36mm ,a Standard Lens 50mm , A Portrait Lens 100mm , A Telephoto Lens 200mm And a 300mm and 400mm Telephoto Lens , All On one Camera ! Think if You had to Carry all That ! I usually Do ! Now with a 4GB SDHC Card You Get About 768 Pictures ! Thats 21 Rolls of 36 exp Film !Have You Carryed 21 Rolls of Film or Tryed Loading a Roll of Film in Cold Weather ? I Have , its not Fun to Be in the Middle of a Shoot and You Run Out of Film ! Also The savings alone of Not Buying Film anymore Will Pay For The Camera . The One Draw Back to This Camera is You Cant Store The Pictures To Raw Data , But Again the Trade off is The Size of The Camera . if Your Doing Blow-ups to 8x10 the Quality of The Pictures are Great , Meaning its Better to Have A Smaller Picture then No Picture at All ! The other Draw Back is The Manual Focus , But Again Thats one of The Trade-offs . Now this also is a Video Camera and with 4GBs they claim 1 Hour of Video with Stereo Sound ! Try that with Your 35mm Film Camera !There is Alot to this Camera and for Me , it will take awhile to Learn each one , But thats Part of The Fun of it !No Camera will take Great Pictures , The Camera is Just a Tool , its The Person Behind the Camera That Creates Great Pictures  , This is a Fun Camera and if Your Having Fun , You will Take Great Pictures ! Cheers  Up Date ! March 17,08 , After Using this Camera For awhile I Am Having a Blast ! My Canon D20 has Dust on it . Some Features I Would Like To Talk About Are The My Colors Selector , This Mimics Different Film , What do I mean ? Color Films Favored One Color or Another , Example , Kodak Film Brought Out the Reds , So select Red in My Colors and it Mimics Kodak Film , Want a Fuji Film Look , Select Green and it Mimics Fuji Film ! it even Gives You a Slide Film Look , Select Positive in My Colors Section .I even Pulled a Fuji Reala Film Look out of it , one of My Favorite Films ! I use this Camera on Manual , as it Functions as a 35mm Film Camera , My A-1 had Auto modes I never Used , Because its Easyer to Shot in Manual Mode , If that Scares You , Dont Let it , Any Basic Photography Book will Give You What You Need , You Miss Out on What this Camera Can Do 1n Auto Mode . I think this is one of the Reasons some People are Having Problems with this Camera , The other is this is not a Computer Based Camera , it is Really Designed for the Photographers as a Film Camera .The other Great Feature is to Be able to Change a Color Picture to Black and White , Have a Great Picture , But it Lacks Color or is alittle Washed out ? Change it to Black and White !I use the Canon Rechargeable Batterys , as I Like the Charging Kit , it Functions much like Charging The Canon D20 Batterys .I Have Been Using 4GB SD Cards and Have Gotten 1567 Pictures Before I Have to Reload !In Film Terms, Thats 43 Rolls of 36exp Film !The Picture in My Profile Page was taken with this Camera !I wish You Many Great Pictures and all the Fun That Brings !", "Date": "March 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Has some great features", "Author": "Tezza \"Tezza\"", "ReviewID": "R13MP9FPREB6JC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All cameras are loaded with compromises, however the S5's impressive features outshine the drawbacks.The S5 picture quality is very impressive. Shots tend to be well exposed.  Image stabilization keeps blurred images to a minimum.  A complete novice could use this camera \"out of the box\" and product a high percentage of \"keeper\" photos.Lens quality is impressive. The S5 has a looong zoom range from 36 to 422mm - which should suffice for most situations.  Too bad the lens isn't 28mm at the most wide angle, and then it would be truly a versatile tool.  Sometimes you will have to stand back a bit to get the whole scene in without the 28mm wide angle capability.The long end of this lens is 432mm which is extreme telephoto.  To be honest, the long end of this lens results in very dark photos - to the point it's of limited use.  However it never hurts to have a long zoom so that you can grab some kind of shot of a long distance object, even though the photo quality won't be great.The zoom is a little \"touchy\" however it can be gotten used to.Another amazing feature of this camera is the movie mode.  This camera can take better movies than most movie cameras below $1,000 US dollars.  The camera could be justified in it's own right as an inexpensive but high quality movie camera.The S5 is also quite small and light, so it won't be a problem around your neck during vacation.All in all, this is a very impressive camera at a really nice price.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the lack of 28mm at the wide angle, and the slightly touch zoom control.All cameras are compromises, but the image quality, lens and superb video quality - and consider the low price - the S5 has to be highly recommended.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Dead", "Author": "Fred Menschel \"FISHING NUT\"", "ReviewID": "R37EOX2OS880XO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have this camera for about 6 months, it started out great, great pictures.

The lens cap does come off far too easily. I have a habit of mistreating my cameras, even when I try to take care of them, and the lens cap is something I rely on to help me take care of the camera. There needs to be a tighter, stronger lens cap. There is a good thing about the lens cap popping off so easily though. If you have to get ready to shoot quickly, as soon as you turn the camera on, the cap pops off and you are ready to go.The S5IS has great features and is ergonomically designed.

The other reviews and technical data will make it clear what an impressive set of features this camera possesses.  I wanted a camera that used AA's, had a high zoom and powerful macro, and offered a top-of-its-class movie mode.  The Canon S5 gives me all of these.  It also has full manual control and a multitude of settings, and you would do well to learn how to use them.  Auto mode generally does \"okay\" but you can always get a better picture by tailoring the settings to the situation.It is important to understand that a \"bridge\" or \"mid-range\" camera is not necessarily \"mid-way\" between a $100 point-and-shoot and a dSLR in picture quality.  The S5 is more like a point-and-shoot model which has been enclosed in a dSLR body.  What you're getting is not a low-end dSLR, so much as a high-end point & shoot.  Nevertheless, the S5 can take some amazing pictures.  Like every Canon I've used, the S5 has excellent color and exposure and does well at preserving fine detail.  Check out the Canon S5 page at flickr for samples of the beautiful images skilled photographers have gotten from this camera.  Although it may only have a point-and-shoot heart, the controls permit you to coax some incredible details and effects.However, the limited sensor size of the S5 (compared with a true dSLR) does mean high image noise at relatively low ISO, as most reviewers have noted.  Canon has opted not to include aggressive noise reduction in this model.  Thankfully, Neat Image does a perfect job 90% of the time cleaning up noise from anything you want to view or print at larger than postcard size.I've seen pictures from three similar cameras owned by my colleagues at work):  the Sony DSC H9, Fuji S100 (which actually is priced considerably higher than the S5), plus one more the name of which escapes me.  All three were good cameras and had their virtues, but overall I preferred the color of the S5 and the class-leading movie mode.I also wish the S5 had a true wide-angle, but it is possible to buy a lens that goes to 28mm (35 mm equivalent).  Image stabilization on the S5 has satisfied me and made it possible to shoot decent telephoto without a tripod.  The f-stop range is enough to enable decent blurring of the background for close-ups, which is something you usually can't do with lower-priced P&S;'s.I also like that control over several features (ISO, flash, focus, etc) has been moved to the body.  I may not like where some of the buttons ended up, but the body does not feel cluttered and it's nice not to have to go hunting for the control in a menu.The electronic viewfinder has gotten some criticism for its low resolution, but I wanted a viewfinder and I'm glad the S5 has one.  It's convenient to have it for when ambient lighting washes out the LCD.  It also enables you to compose your pictures with the camera held against your face for additional stabilization.  I assume it consumes less power than the LCD, too, making it an attractive option if you're trying to husband battery power.I don't really watch the digital camera market closely, but I expect within a year we're going to see mid-range models step up to larger sensors which truly will bring them closer to dSLR's in their picture quality.  If you can wait for the next generation of cameras, it might be worth it to save your money till then.  But if you need to have something now (I did!) the S5 is a great value and you should enjoy learning to get the most out of it.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Terrific Camera", "Author": "T.

The time from off to ready to shoot is among the best of the p&S; cameras. Shutter lag is pretty good, much better than my old Sony and my wifes Konica. Great movie mode. Light on batteries. Nice LCD that can be folded away to protect it.Cons; Hunts for focus at long telephoto occasionally. Could use a better AF assist lamp. Using auto mode sets ISO higher than I would like.

This can be eliminated by purchasing a LA-DC58E Conversion Lens Adapter for the camera. Not only does it allow a better hold on the camera for zooming it also lets you put on a haze or UV filter to protect your lens. A secure 58mm lens cap would then be used to protect the filter and lens. Not much of a big deal for such a fine camera.

I enjoy photography on an ametuer level, so I thought I would take it up a notch slowly before jumping into a fancy camera that costs $1,000+As always, Amazon came through and the communication and delivery from them met my expectations. (I always check amazon for anything related to this camera before I look anywhere else). For what I wanted, this camera does the job. I have taken some amazing sunset shots and most recently attended a bodybuilding competition where I got to test the Powershot S5 IS in low light and also the \"action/sports\" setting, as there was a lot of quick movement I wanted to capture. The pictures turned out great. I have a bad habit of taking a million pictures and rarely making prints because I share them mostly online. There were a few prints I made at the beginning when I was just learning to use the camera and they came out grainy and \"soft\" looking- so I was starting to doubt this purchase as others had commented on this issue as well. I read the manual thoroughly to see if I could fix this problem and played around with the camera, taking pictures of anything from my feet to our cats- basically anything where I could test ALL of the settings in different light. I recently made prints after learning more about the camera and they came out flawless, I really have no complaints about the quality.Yes, the camera lens falls off all of the time. It gets annoying, but you just have to be extra careful. I wouldn't say that's a reason not to buy this camera though. I would advise in purchasing a good quality camera bag and lens cleaner in case you are like me and keep the lens cap off most of the time. I have been pleasantly surprised with how well the batteries last in this camera- this too depends on how much you are using the flash, zoom and other features. I recently purchased the eneloop rechargeable battery pack, so we shall see how those batteries do- I've heard good things.Overall, if you are looking for a point and shoot camera on steroids at an affordable price- this is the one. It has lots of fun features to play with, allowing you to take your ametuer photography to its fullest potential. There are a few accessory lens and flash options to beef this camera up even more as your skills progress. I suggest reading lots of reviews on this camera and its accessories on Amazon and other Techie sites as they are very informative to a beginner, also read the manual- it helps. One thing I did find out about this camera is that it is not able to shoot in the RAW format- something that most beginners won't care about, but also something you should know before buying. If you think you might want to take your photography to the next level, I would suggest purchasing a camera that shoots in RAW.

I'd like to have a DSLR for the large lenses & better image quality.  But I also wanted the comprehensive feature set the S5 has (in a smaller package), and I wasn't willing to fork over a  huge investment to get all those features in a DSLR and multiple lenses.So far I have shot several hundred photos with it and some are among my best ever.  The S5 has not disappointed, and has inspired me to a greater interest in photography.Favorite Features of this Camera... Image Stablized Big Zoom, low-light/high ISO, Face Recognition & focus, fast shutter response, larger lens = better image quality vs point&shoots;, Large Flip-out Display, Flash Hot-Shoe, Stereo Video, artistic modes, on-board Red-Eye correction, Price.I think the performance of these cameras regarding noise and ISO settings is mis-represented by some reviews.In my experience the noise level in AUTO (compared to point & shoots) is very good. Considering this lens offers 12x zoom, I think it is unrealistic to expect miracles in low-light from the digital ISO setting.  In this low-price, feature laden camera I think the emphasis for the ISO setting should have more to do with well-lit, high-speed action.The same concepts that apply to film - apply to digital photography... Using 800 ISO produces faster response and better contrast in low light, but there is also more \"noise\".  In tricky lighting or moving scenes don't lean on the ISO setting.  You are probably better off to avoid fooling with the ISO setting since it just shifts the sliding scale for shutter speed and aperture anyway.  Use the custom settings such as \"sports\" or \"night shot\" to shift the ratio of aperture and exposure time to get best results.  For minimal noise, use minimum ISO, and maximize lighting, aperture and/or exposure time depending on the subject. Keep in mind that in order for these optics deliver 12x zoom, even close up, these lenses will reduce the light delivered to the sensor.  And the digital sensor has a fundamental limit of sensitivity to lumens that is mainly limited by its smaller area compared to DSLRs. If there isn't enough light, the high ISO settings won't magically capture images without any noise.  However the Auto setting with Image Stab produces nice stills in low light.

It's a light camera too, and easy to carry. One thing I must clarify: there are many complaints about the fact that the lens cover comes off too easily. Well, that's a good thing! It is human nature to forget to remove the lens cap before you extend that lens and we have done it many times. The easy off lens cap certainly protects the mechanism that opens the lens and with it being rather loose, the lens just \"pops\" off.

I took a picture of a crane that was at about 50 stories up and a block away, and zooming in, between the optical and digital zoom, I could actually see a person inside the machine!  Indoors the pictures are ok, just like any other camera, and you have a lot of different options to work with to come up with something really nice.There is one thing I don't like about the camera.  The lack of Optical viewfinder.  With my other Powershots, I used to turn the lcd screen to my daughter so that she can see herself while I was taking her picture, and I would focus looking through the viewfinder.  With this camera you can't do this; EITHER you use the screen OR you use the viewfinder.  Something I guess I can live with, but I like to be like Hannah Montana and \"have the best of both worlds\"!Some people complain about the lens cover being so easy to come off, and that's true.  The only explanation I find for that is that without it being so easily removable, if by accident you pressed the on button without taking the cover off, you might mess up the lens itself.

I was able to buy everything needed here from Amazon obtaining free shipping for the whole order . I bought the camera , 75 case wich is basically a belt worn one that tightly fits the camera , 4 extra batteries , and a memory chip period if you want more you should buy up but I like this for day travel .The camera comes with a lens cap , batteries , neck chord and 32 mg memory chip .

I was able to set it up ( put on the neck strap with lens cap camera holder so you dont loose it ) read the intro manual and download the softare , take some photos within a hour of unpacking it . You can use this as point and shoot if you want . Just adjust the zoom to frame in what you want its so easy . Yes its a little bulky compared to newer stuff but its no Poloriod Land Camera .It did take 11 days for me to get my Camera by regular ground free shipping . They called in the morning to confirm someone would sign for it . It was boxed very nice and brought by UPS . I saved quite a bit over sale price at Best Buy plus no tax . When it comes to important merchandise I do not want to take a chance getting burned on Amazon is the place to go . I charged it on my platinum card doubling the 1 year Cannon parts and labor mail in warranty over buying one .

They don't claim you can, but it would be nice. Nikons do.My camera gives no reasonable warning about the battery charge. It displays a warning message, and then quits.

I haven't run any tests with the Image Stabilization turned off, but the images that I have taken hand held at max zoom look really good. This camera works fine as a point and shoot, but also has the capability to do much more. The flash is typical for any point and shoot but it does have a hot shoe for an external flash. The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars are for the Cons listed below...but these are mostly ergonomic design issues and don't interfere with the basic photography process.Pros: Basically does what it says. Good quality images. Zoom works fast. AF seems to be pretty accurate. I haven't used any manual settings yet except to explore the functionality. Adjusting shutter and aperture are quick and easy. The pull out screen looks good. It is easy to toggle setting information off and on for those that are interested in ISO, Shutter speed, etc. I seem to remember that Digital Zoom was enable out of the box and since this is a worthless addition to any camera and should be disabled before shooting.Cons: The optical view finder is less than stellar...almost useless. My guess is that Canon expects most people to use the LCD display. There was some lag time between shots that seemed a bit long. This could be due to the LCD display of the last shot taken. I haven't disabled that yet to see if it recycles faster but I assume it will. The worst part of this camera is the battery/memory card access. This is done through the bottom of the camera. Opening the compartment is easy. But you have to keep the camera upside down or all 4 of the batteries will spill out as you are changing the memory card. Closing the compartment is rather tricky as you have to push down on the cover rather hard in order to slide it back in place. Doing so requires you to get a firm grip in the top part of the camera, possibly gripping buttons a bit hard, in order to manage the entire process. It just feels like a lot of pressure is being exerted to close the cover which makes me wonder how long the hinge will last. You can't easily remove the SDCard and set the camera down without the batteries falling out...or you have to manhandle the lid closed again. Seems this could have been designed MUCH better. I have a 300D with a rechargeable battery. This battery latches in place and will not fall out if the compartment is open. If Canon was going to opt for 4 AA batteries it would have been better to separate the battery and SDCard compartments. I'm sure many people will find themselves chasing batteries across the floor at some point.Also: The lens cover is not tight...this is by design and is really more of a warning than an issue. Since the lens completely retracts when you turn it off and then extends when you turn it on, they have designed the cover to pop off automatically when the lens extends. This keeps the lens motor from being destroyed. But it also makes it easy for the lens cover to pop off when you don't want it to so be aware of this if you are carrying it around out of a case.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Pat", "ReviewID": "R2SJ1252CQTQRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned the Canon G2 for many years and took thousands of pictures all over the world.

The macro and super macro open up a whole new world of photography for the amature like myself.

With a tripod I was able to open the shutter a bit longer and get a high qual shot (of non-moving objects)in manual. I have not tried a hot shoe flash yet and I'm hoping that improves the indoor low light shooting. Don't get me wrong the pictures are still really good.The lens cap issue so many others complain about is a non-issue as far as I can tell. Yes it falls off easy, but if your like me that is a good thing. I have turned the camera on serveral times with the lens cap still in place. The cap easily poped off when the lens hit it. This protects your zoom motor from damage.If your a novice like myself and know just enough to be dangerous be warned.

I have been an owner of the S2-IS for many years but it just finally gave up the ghost. I don't believe it is product deficiency but just some rugged use and thousand and thousand of pictures and videos taken. It was time to move up. I was so impressed with the S2-IS that the obvious choice was to look at the improved version. I still shopped around but given the choices and my previous experience, the S5-IS was the logical choice.First, the pro's: Overall, an excellent camera. Excellent pictures w/fine detail. The enhanced video device within the camera is much better that the S2-IS. If you like to take pictures and movies, this camera is the best around. The mpeg video is excellent in day light and above average in dim lighting conditions. I am more into pictures but there are times where a video is much better. This is probably the finest feature that Canon created for their cameras. The ability to take high quality pictures along with video.Con's: Sometimes you just want to sit down w/the engineers and say, \"what were you thinking???\" The S2-IS had the card on the side of the camera. All you had to do was pop out the card, insert into your computer, and all is done. The S5-IS card is now in the battery compartment. So you have to turn the camera over, pop out the card, snap the battery compartment back and download your pictures. I believe the fault the engineers assume is that consumers are going to just plug the camera into their computer and let the software automatically download the pictures. Well, if you want a painfully slow process then go this route. Taking the card out and putting into the card reader in my computer is 10 times faster. This is more of a nuisance than anythingThe second \"con\" is the pre-determined shooting modes. In the S2-IS, if I wanted the \"Indoor\" shooting mode but in \"Vivid\" color or maybe \"Black & White\" or \"higher flash exposure\", I could make changes. You can't do that in the S5-IS. The shooting modes are no longer changeable. You have to use one of the manual modes (P, TV, AV, M, C) to get these features.The third con is the Shortcut button. The Shortcut Button was a valuable tool in the S2-IS b/c I could quickly change the picture I wanted to take (i.e. Vivid to Black/White). The Shortcut Button in the S5-IS only has limited function availability now.These \"cons\" are more nuisances than serious design flaws. Again, those that are not as experienced w/this camera will not be affected and will feel my findings are trivial.Recommended Add-Ons:The Canon Conversion Lens Adapter (LA-DC58E) is a must have. One, it is a great lens protector. Secondly, you can add the conversion lenses (I have both the tele-photo and wide-angle lenses.) I initially bought the Conversion Adapter for the tele-photo lens.  I rarely use the tele-photo lens but the Conversion Adapter is constantly on my camera.I also recommend the Canon Snap-On Lens Cover that will fit the Lens Adapter. This is small, convenient, and adds an additional level of protection to the lens.Overall, this is an excellent camera.

I usually take pictures using a traditional Canon EOS 300 with film. When I bought the Powershot S5 I compared it to my SLR. This is not a good idea. As good as the Powershot may be, it can never measure up to a SLR camera. Don't get me wrong, the Powershot is a very good camera but it doesn't aim at the strengths of a SLR.So these are the things I really like about the Powershot:* The quality of the pictures is usually very good when taken at low ISO settings. The level of noise in the pictures increases dramatically when you increase the ISO setting.* It supports most of the shooting modes I use with my EOS. Setting the aperture manually for example or calculating the shutter time and aperture without using the flash are essential features the Powershot almost handles in the same way like a traditional SLR. You'll immediately be familiar on how to use this.* The camera is easy to handle, especially when you're used to other Canon equipment. It feels very natural in your hands and it's easy to do difficult shots where I'd use a tripod with other cameras.* It's a very solid piece of hardware that doesn't feel cheap or crappy at all. For me, that was a major buying argument* Given the functionality of the camera, it's still very compact compared to a SLR.* I appreciate the fact that the large display can be \"hidden\", thus protecting it from scratches and saving battery power while shooting.* The additional equipment available for the camera makes it worthwile for a long time until you might want to invest into a real digital SLR camera.At this price you'll hardly find a better camera. If you want a better camera you'll probably have to invest into a SLR at approximately twice the price.

The separate video button is GENIUS and still lacking on a lot of competitors!  Not having to switch dials etc. is ideal for sports and children playing because second-to-second you can alternate from video clips to photos.  This camera is a great all-in-one for vacations for the same reason.  Video is not HD but is generally good enough to be quite useful and the zoom is progressive and smooth even when on video mode.  Battery life is quite good using eneloop batteries and I rarely run them dry even with lots of screen use.

I've had it for 4 years now, and it's everything I want in a camera. (Well, now at 4 years old, there are cameras out with more megapixels, but 8 MP is still pretty good these days.) I needed a camera that could keep up with two energetic young boys, something I could point and shoot before I missed the moment, but something with more features for the times when I had time to set up a shot. The super long zoom is great for sports, and the dedicated video button is a must!The S5 has been ideal. It powers up super fast, recycles super fast, finds the focus super fast, and takes the shot right when I want with no lag. The layout is ideal, providing everything you need right at your fingertips, and yet designed so well you never accidentally change the settings (as I have on my other cameras). It runs on 4 AA batteries, which I highly prefer over specialized rechargable batteries. I use rechargable AAs that I can put in my 15-minute charger, but if you're really in a hurry, you can always just pop in some regular alkalines. Love that flexibility!This was lightyears ahead of the Coolpix I had been using, has a better layout than the Finepix I have, and puts everything right where I need it. Now after trying out the new Powershot SX40, I still love my S5. As the Powershot line continues to come out with new releases, the software can do a mind-boggling amount of processing, but it's slowing down the time it takes to focus. I'm not a fan of the SX40's auto mode as it tends to focus on objects that aren't my focal point -- thank goodness for manual mode!PROS:Great zoomLightning fast all aroundNice button layoutDedicated video button -- everything is accessible, but you don't accidentally change settingsLots of bells and whistlesHotshoeSuper close macro mode takes great shots!AA battery gives you options (recharge in your own 15-minute charger or use alkalines for speedy charges)CONS:Lens cap is a bit annoying. It falls off at the slightest bump, so you have to be careful.SD card and battery compartment are the same. This never bothered me, but it's probably not the ideal layout.The battery indicator doesn't give you a lot of warning before the battery dies, although there is a software hack available for that.SUMMARY:If you're looking for a great camera to keep up with kids, sports, and animals -- this is it!

Wide flexibility in a relatively small and light package.  Takes wonderfully sharp and balanced image-stabilized pictures at 80 or 100 ISO.  Has a zoom range that used to require 10 pounds of lenses.  Focuses quickly and dependably.  Takes truly decent videos with stereo sound.  Stores images on inexpensive SD cards.  Has a moveable, articulated LCD screen.  Runs \"forever\" on four rechargeable AA batteries if composition's done through the viewfinder - a feature that's becoming increasingly rare on non-DSLR cameras.Sure . . . . pictures start getting noisy fast at ISO 200 and above.  Changing settings beyond what's under the \"function\" button can be user-unfriendly.  Low-light performance and bokeh pale in comparison to even a basic current DSLR.  And finally, while comparable models from Olympus, Nikon, Sony, and others may be a bit better or worse, similar limits exist with pretty much any point-and-shoot camera.Accepting those limits, the S5 is a great newbie's camera that \"even a caveman can use\" in the Auto mode five minutes after loading some batteries and an SD card -- then play with later to learn about Aperture and Shutter priorities, exposure compensation, spot metering, ISO and bokeh.  Since I'm a good ways along that learning curve, my S5 serves as a DSLR companion that's now used when I want to travel light, just take some simple snapshots, or want to make a movie.  For those uses, it's a keeper and a definite 5-star performer within its limits.With the advent of the SX10, I think Canon's stopped production and sales of the S5.  But used ones are pretty widely available in the mid-$200 range.  Additionally, the earlier and not-too-different S3is has comparable performance and commonly sells used in the low to mid $100's.

This is the next best thing, in my opinion. I love the option of full manual control, and the automatic and program modes make this camera nearly foolproof. I was taking great pictures right out of the box, and they've only gotten better as I've learned more about the camera. Contrary to what other reviewers have experienced, I've enjoyed the AA batteries. It's nice to know that if I'm out on vacation and run the batteries down, I can pop into Walgreens and grab a pack for $4 rather than being without my camera until I can charge it. I immediately replaced mine with Low Self-Discharge rechargeables and find they have a remarkable lifespan. I can take probably 300 pictures or more on a charge. I've been using this camera for 6 months now, and here are some of my experiences with it:Pros:1. Zoom- Once you get used to it, the zoom is really precise. I can compose a shot in under a second without having to fiddle with it too much. At first, the variable speed zoom lever takes a little trial and error though.2. Hotshoe- To be honest here, I don't have a speedlight yet. But I am thrilled to have the option and it's next on my list to purchase.3. Layout- I find the buttons, menus and overall layout of the camera extremely intuitive and easy to use. Buttons are easily accessible and comfortable while gripping the camera. After one quick read through the manual, I could easily locate any setting I might need in the menu system.4. LCD- I am so addicted to the pivoting screen that I'm afraid I won't be able to take pictures without it when the time finally comes to upgrade from this camera. I love that I can take eye-level shots of my kids without crawling through the mud with them, lol. I can compose shots that do not include tourists' heads because I can hold the camera above the heads and still see the screen. I can take a family portrait and see that everyone is actually in the frame. Brilliant!5. Pictures  a. Auto- This camera takes some of the best exposed, consistently good pictures of any point and shoot I've ever used. This holds especially true in low light.  b. Manual- Mastering manual control was much simpler than I thought. Nearly all the adjustments can be made with the 4-way button. The on-screen meter runs a little underexposed for my taste, but only by about 1/4 stop. I just compensate accordingly with my settings.6. Focus checking- I frequently use the feature that shows where the camera focused after the shot. It's as easy as tapping the display button while the review image is displayed on the screen and it shows a crop at 100%, a bounding box around the focal point, the histogram and a few other details. This can be an invaluable tool when shooting because nearly all shots look sharp on the LCD of a digital camera. It's not till you download them to your computer or try to print that you'll realize if the focus was off.7. Size/weight- The camera just feels good in the hand. Enough weight and grip to balance nicely and get a stable shot. The ergonomics make it easy to hand hold, even with one hand.Cons:1. Noisy- At anything above 200 (and sometimes even lower than that), the pictures are really noisy.2. Lens cap- This might seem like a petty complaint, but really the lens cap is an important part of any camera, protecting its most delicate part. And this one is terrible. It falls off if you so much as look at the camera too hard. Forget about tossing it in a bag or purse, you'd better have a dedicated camera bag for it in case the cap pops off in transit (which it most certainly will).3. Lack of available accessories- This really limits this camera, in my opinion. The only accessories available for this model are wide angle, teleconverter and close up lenses. A greater variety of lenses and other accessories (like the underwater housing available for previous models) would have been nice.In addition to these cons, I have had 2 problems this far: the supplied USB cable died after only a few months. While I realize cables are cheap and readily available, it was a difficult problem to diagnose and caused a lot of frustration. For the price of this camera, and the fact that it comes with zero accessories, I expect the things it did include to be of a higher quality. The other problem I have is that after less than 6 months of use, the pivoting screen no longer consistently detects it's position. When I try to flip the screen outward, the camera switches the display back to the viewfinder. It works fine when I have it opened away from the camera, but as soon as it clicks in place, the display transfers. I have to turn the camera on and off several times to restore correct functionality of the screen. This is frustrating, and I've missed a shot several times because I am fighting with the camera instead of taking pictures. I plan to contact Canon customer service about this issue, but was waiting until after my recent family vacation in case the camera needs to be sent in for service. I docked the rating of the camera 1 star for the Cons and also this problem.

For somebody who wants a point and shoot, this isn't the camera for you. It isn't too portable and won't fit in your pocket. But if you are anything from an amateur photographer who wants a good automatic features to a professional who wants a supplement to a DSLR, this camera is perfect and definitely worth the money.The best thing about this camera is its ability to take good videos. There may be other cameras with comparable picture quality but nothing compares when it comes to a still camera taking videos. it takes crystal clear videos at 640x480 and 30 fps and even 60 fps at 320x280. You can zoom during the video. The way you take videos is by pressing the dedicated movie button. There is a movie mode on the mode dial which serves absolutely no purpose seeing as you can take a movie in every mode, and if you press the shutter button in movie mode it takes a picture. This is a minor quibble that in no way detracts from the quality of the camera.The color LCD is gorgeous and really gives you a good sense of how beautiful the pictures are. The EVF has a disappointingly low resolution but it does its job.The 12x zoom is great. The optical image stabilization is flawless. The camera doesn't perform as well as I had hoped in low light, but the camera does better with the flash than most cameras do.The flash is nice- it won't pop up when you press the shutter. When you want the flash you flip it up manually. Occasionally, the camera will not want to use the flash when it is up, and instead of using it anyway, you press the shutter button and... nothing happens. But this doesnt happen too often.This camera has everything you'll want and more, and is a pleasure to use. If you don't care much about the video quality, check out the sx 100 is. It is the same camera only more compact, with a 10x zoom and which doesn't take very good videos, but it has the same image stabilizer and CCD.This camera is excellent.

Now I'm back to a Canon and glad I am.  It is so much more intuitive than the Olympus. I haven't even read the manual and I can navigate the controls pretty well. Of course, my SLR experience with a Canon is helping there.  When I want to do some more complicated things, I'll have to open the book.  But I haven't had it long - so this is a sort of \"at first glance\" review.Maybe every digital in this price range has the cool features I like, such as image stabilization ,etc, so I'm not going to dwell on that.  It meets my needs, especially the 12X optical zoom, an iron-clad requirement for me.  Forget digital zoom, it is worse than worthless.The one thing I absolutely HATE about this camera (but it wouldn't have deterred me from buying it) is its loose lens cap.  Yeah, the SLR was the same way.  Helloooo, Canon?  Can't you do better? Also, I can't put a UV filter on it to protect the lens.  Oh, well.Oh, another thing I'm not particularly happy about:  the Olympus put the date in the file name.  That was darn handy.  Canon just numbers the images.  And although it's nice that in Explore the camera shows up as itself in the list, if I look at the files there, they have no time, just a date.  When I copy them to another folder, the time shows up.  Maybe I have to configure the software for that - but as I said, I haven't read the book yet.  Nor have I used the software for uploading - I'm used to doing it the manual way with Explore.And think long about buying its Canon case - at least see my review there first.

The video features of this camera are especially keen - the ability to shoot up to a full, continuous hour of video in stereo is awesome, because I've been wanting to interview and make a documentary about my grandfather for a long time, and couldn't buy both a new camera and a camcorder. I spent a lot of today, Thanksgiving, making home movies of his piano playing, which was fantastic, and the camera starts up very quickly so I didn't have to miss much, if any, of the opening notes.The only things I've observed, so far, as being drawbacks - and they are pretty big drawbacks, for me - is that I've yet to discover a good setting for shooting decent pictures in low light without a flash. My A95 was far superior to this model in that regard. I shoot a lot of bands in low-lit clubs, and with the A95, I could just wave it over my head, with a cursory glance at the LCD screen, and get dozens of great, well-illuminated images with just stage lighting and no flash. This one either requires a combination of settings I just haven't found yet or isn't capable of the ease of point-and-shoot low-light photography. Don't get me wrong - the A95 wasn't perfect in that regard, as I also did get a bit of noise in dim lighting, but I did get bright scenes with a fast shutter speed, something I'm not finding a good or simple way to do with this camera. As soon as I've found a good combo of aperture, speed, and ISO, I'm sure I'll save it using the Custom feature (once I read how to use it!) and I'll be good to go, but from what I can tell, I can't do the same kinds of indoor night shots without a flash and not get a lot of blur or very dark images, or a much greater amount of noise than with my trusty A95.The Macro and Super Macro functions are also quite nice, and the video functionality and the super-big swivel LCD features were major selling points (why doesn't Canon make ALL their cameras with swiveling LCDs?), and all-in-all I'd say it was a good upgrade. The good seems to outweigh the bad. Dedicated buttons for video and image-taking are cool, and the zoom I've found to be very nice and nearly silent, as is the camera start-up, which is great for shooting in quiet circumstances without creating an interruption.I do recommend the S5, with the aforementioned reservations/ considerations.", "Date": "November 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Best Camera I Have Ever Owned!", "Author": "Wayne Yarrell", "ReviewID": "R25LLJ8XW8ZYOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an amateur photographer and have been taking pictures for over 30 years.

I can shoot in Program, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, Sports, Manual and a host of other modes, including Auto, plus, it has a great movie mode as well, so you can use it like you would a camcorder, if that is your preference.  Also, I love the fact that it uses AA batteries.  It is always a plus if you are ever taking photos and you get a low battery warning, all you have to do is pop in a new set, instead of having to recharge your camera.  I have purchased rechargeable batteries for it, and I would highly recommend it, because it eats up AAs if you are doing a lot of shooting.  The other nice thing is that you can purchase adapters to add different filters to get really cool photo effects, and there are also adaptive lenses out there as well.So, if you are looking for a great camera, and you would like to delve into the photography world, but your budget doesn't include DSLRs, then this is a great choice, IMHO.", "Date": "November 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Almost SLR performance for less than half the price", "Author": "Angelia B.

Also the lens cover was affixed to the body instead of the lens that comes out, so they had to make the latch really loose to keep from damaging the camera if you forgot to remove the lens cover before turning the camera on, you barely touch it and it comes off!

The down side is, unlike 99% of the digital cameras offered in the market place, this camera will not allow the dragging or coping of its own files from a computer based storage folder back to its incorporated memory card. In other words once you transfer or relocate a file or files from the memory card thats it, i.e. you can never drag or copy it back to the memory card in the camera.While Canon touts the use of Camera Window this is  luck based or wishful thinking more than any assurance of the action. It is not reliable mostly does not perform as touted or promised.Why does this matter, after all anyone moving a file or files off their camera most surely wants to put it in another place.......not really.

I was overjoyed at the time I got it because I finally had a camera that was better than a wimpy, cheap digital camera. However, from the very start I was always extremely annoyed with: 1) the inconvenience of the camera running on batteries. I found it to be quite the battery hog and the batteries only lasted about two days tops before they had to be replaced. 2) I was NEVER impressed with the use of the flash on the camera. It either created red eyes or, depending on how far I zoomed in on an object, it took up to a minute to shoot one single picture. 3) It sucks with close-ups and outdoor shots (especially during the winter and on gloomy/humid days). 4) The camera hardly ever focuses when you want it to. If you shake it even the slightest bit, you have to zoom all the way out and start over or switch the settings to something that'll work correctly. It's extremely annoying! and 5) It absolutely SUCKS with moving objects in hardly dim light.Quite frankly, the only good thing about the camera was it took decent pictures in the sunlight. Other than outdoors in the middle of the day, the camera is absolutely useless to someone like me. I got 20 times better shots using a Nikon coolpix s3100, which cost me only 100 bucks. The S5 was a complete disappointment. Anyday now, I'll be upgrading to a Canon EOS Rebel T3 (1100d).All in all, the S5 proved to just be an inconvenience and a waste of my money. It's okay for amateurs who are not into \"portrait\" kind of photography, but it's no good for someone who wants a decent shot that gets above a 3 star rating. I personally had a lot of problems with the piece-o-junk. I don't know about anyone else who bought this camera.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Nice Super-Zoom With Manual Control Options", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R2Z2484R5N2F1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The S5 gives me a great deal of control over my photos, enabling me to select the ISO level, and adjust contrast, color saturation, and sharpness.  The 36mm to 400mm zoom is almost perfect...28mm to 400mm would have been better.The S5's image stabilizer enables me to take sharp photos at 400mm.  Today, I took a photo of people standing on the penthouse deck of a 20 story building that was 200 yards away.  You could see that one of the people on the roof had a cigerette in her hand.The flip-out viewfinder may sound like a gimmick, but now that I have used it, I would hate to be without it.  Today, I was taking photos with the camera held up above my head, and the viewfinder let me see exactly what I was doing.  The eyelevel viewfinder is provides an excessively contrasty view, with highlights blown out, and odd color shifting,  but a mediocre eyelevel viewfinder is better than none at all..and none at all is what most cameras provide in 2011.In bright sunlight, the S5 provides the rich, but natural colors that Canon is known for.  However, in shadow areas, and in low light, the colors can become murky and dull.  And worse, the S5 has problems with high contrast subjects:  you can expose for the highlights, and have the shadow areas become dark and murky.  Or, if you expose to bring out detail in the shadow areas, the highlight areas are totally washed out.The performance with the built-in flash is okay, as long as you keep the subject in the three feet to seven feet range.  Outside of that, results can vary.  The flash, using AA batteries, takes a good amount of time to recycle, especially if you are shooting a series of flash photos.I have been using Sanyo Eneloop AA batteries, and get 400 to 500 photos outdoors without flash.  Using a lot of flash would likely make it necessary to recharge after 200 to 300 photos.  I keep an extra set of Eneloops with me, so I can take up to 1,000 photos before recharging.A polarizer filter is very helpful for landscape photography, so I've added the Sakar Digital Concepts 58mm lens adapter to my S5.  It enables me to use a 58mm polarizer filter with NO darkening of corners, as the Sakar adapter is perfectly designed for the Canon S5.  The Sakar 58mm threaded wide angle lens converts the 36mm lense of the S5 into a wider \"fixed\" length 28mm lens (zooming causes focus problems with the 28mm adapter mounted).And, lens caps fit tightly to the Digital Concepts lens adapter and don't fall off as the original Canon lens cap does.  I'm leaving the Digital Concepts lens adapter on my S5 permanently, as it protects the lens, and you can grip the convertor with your left hand to keep the camera steady.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "amazing", "Author": "dena cellini", "ReviewID": "R2Y7GO9XLGRE7N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera before my 6 month stay in Argentina, I love this camera!

Maite \"I love books\"", "ReviewID": "RZ3S1OWSOGTVF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research, I finally bought this camera mainly to have a long zoom with which to take sports photos. But I find that it is a great all around to have. I especially like having the ability to zoom in movie mode. This is one of the few cameras on the market to offer that feature, and it has come in handy more often than I ever imagined.The image quality is excellent for a digital camera. Other reviewers here have complained about the noise, but I have found that virtually all point and shoot digital cameras have noise problems, especially in low-light situations. There are work-arounds to avoid some of the noise issues in the myriad manual controls on this camera, including an ISO setting (even though I'd recommend using the f-stop settings instead), and I have found that I can effectively eliminate noise in all but the lowest-light by utilizing a combination of manual settings.The scene modes are really handy if you want to point and shoot in a hurry, without bothering with the manual controls.---The sports setting in particular is great for catching fast-motion action, but it is also useful for other situations. The continuous-picture drive in sports mode ensures that you get great shots.---The portrait setting allows you take photos with really effective depth-of-field focusing, whether you are taking an actual portrait or other photos where you might like that effect.---The color swap/custom color feature is great for taking more artistically styled photos. I took photos at a ballet studio, targeting the pink ballet tights for a muted pink custom color and the effect was just beautiful and similar to a hand-painted black and white photo.The flip out LCD screen on the back is a terrific feature that few cameras have. This feature does mean that the screen size is a bit smaller, but I think it's worth the trade-off. If you are short like me, you can raise the camera at arm's length above your head and still see what you are shooting through the tilted screen. Tilting the screen also allows you to set the camera against still surfaces for steadiness in lower light situations and see the screen without having to contort yourself to do so. You can also turn the LCD screen completely around when you are taking timed shots that you yourself are in.There are so many settings to experiment with on this camera. That's half the fun of it. The other half is having the ability to take truly beautiful and spectacular photos.", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "Albert S.

I replaced a 3 yr old S2 IS.  It developed some blurring on the left of the image in the last few months (other than that reliable as heck) and at over $150 for Canon to repair, it was time to upgrade.  The S5 is basically just an upgrade from the earlier Powershot S2 and S3. Same lens, just more pixels and some additional features and functionality.I understand the problems with the camera series; low light focussing is difficult; chromatic abberations to the extremes of the image with high contrast edges; grainy shots above ISO 200, appalling lens cap concept.  However, I fixed the lens cap issue by buying a lens adaptor and fitting a standard 52mm UV filter.  I can use the usual snap on lens cap with no problem.  I also have protected the lens surface this way.  It makes for a bulkier camera, (2\" added to lens length) but I'd rather protect it than worry about carrying it.  Having the same lens, I have been able to fit my adaptor to the S5.  The movie function is invaluable.  With this camera, I can take high quality photos and movies - very versatile!  The Image Stabilization is great and works even in movie mode, eliminating the dreaded shaking at high zoom significantly.  The flip-out and rotate LCD screen is good for those over-the-head shots in crowds.  The traditional viewfinder, which I use most of the time, is also useful to stabilize the camera against your face and compose the shot in more detail, especially in bright sunshine.  If you're an \"older\" photographer, you can understand the usefulness of the viewfinder.This camera is not a pocket camera and neither is it a point and shoot.  The functionality of this camera is amazing (the operations manual is 200 pages long!) and the image quality is very good.  It also uses 4 AA batteries; very useful if you need more power from the local store!If you know alot about photography, aperture settings, shutter settings, focussing fields, etc, but you don't want to carry a bulky digital SLR around, [I have a bag for the S5 that hangs around my belt with a velcro loop] and you want movie capability, then this is the camera for you.  It really is a compact version of an SLR, but with movie capability.If you know little about photography, and don't want to learn, then maybe you need a simpler camera.Yes, the S5 IS has some image quality issues, but you won't notice in 95% of your photos.

I would love to have been able to go to a digital SLR but that wasn't in the books this year so I started looking down the scale a bit.Is the S3 IS an upgrade from a film 35mm AE 1 with a good assortment of lenses? After owning the S3 for six or seven months now and taken somewhere around a thousand pictures with it and, with the exception of extreme zoom range pictures, I'll be damn if I can tell the difference. One thing I do notice is the money not spent having to pay to develop all those bracketing/varied angle/change of lighting/etc shots that go in the trash can after the best of the sequence is picked. Then of course there is the two or three thousand photos I can shoot without having to change film.The decision made to do the change I read numerous reviews on every major brand digital camera maker's offerings, examined every options those cameras offered, compared those options to my AE 1, and somewhat considered price (most were so closely priced the issue was almost moot). My conclusion was, obviously, that the S3 gave the best bang for the buck and was superior to the newer S5. I have not been disappointed. Well, there is that lens cover thing, it isn't automatic, you have to put it on and take it off yourself. However that's so minor it borders on compulsive obsessive.NOTE somewhere in the user pictures section of the S3 I have posted a macro called flower.

Let me tell you what a jump that was.  From the expanded LCD screen to an even better zoom (though the S1 has 10x optical & the S5 has 12x optical), I thought it was a pretty good investment. I think it's a much more sturdier hold, that when you hold the S5 and any other camera, you can notice the difference in feel, it feels more like a real camera. Asides from the outside aesthetics, the features aren't anything that's really different from the old version of the camera.  The continuous mode of the S5 is nice, it takes more pictures in a second, however if your subject is constantly on the move it works well only in the daylight or somewhere that has a good light source.  Otherwise it turns out blurry and you'll have to use more exposure or put it on sports mode, which ends up giving you pictures with noise.  The one thing that I still don't like about Canon cameras is that does not do very well in regards to low light.  In addition to that, the camera lens cover does come off easily, let that be a warning to those who like their covers, however I've gotten used to it, and it makes things very easy when you're trying to take a picture on the fly and it pops right off. Overall it's the best bang for your buck, and it's as close to a DSLR you can get for a point & shoot.  There's also the option to get a converter that you can put different lenses on it, but I haven't tried it yet, so I cannot say anything other than that it does offer that other feature.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Deployed camera man", "Author": "Marc P.

So far, I think it is great with some amazing features. The zoom feature is outstanding. I can't believe how far I can zoom. Most of the pictures I have taken are crisp and clear. When I messed around with some of the settings though, some were a bit blurry but I'm sure that is just me trying to figure out all the features and settings of the camera. When we were shopping around for a camera, one of the biggest things we were looking for was shutter speed. We wanted a camera that can take several pictures fast withing a second or two. This camera is pretty good with that, but again, when I messed around with the settings, I must have made it slow down. Of course, this can be fixed by going back to the default settings which is very easy. My main problems which are very small is that the direcions are very confusing. I'm basically learning how to operate the camera and the features by messing around with it myself. I tried to read the instructions, but it is very confusing since there are so many features. Another small problem I'm having is that we can't figure out how to attatch the lens cover and its strap to the actual camera. The lens cap also seems to come off very easily so if you buy this camera, be sure you have it on the right way and don't let small kids get near it. I also don't know how long regular batteries will last, but the camera itself came with 4 AA batteries that died out very quickly so they may have been cheap batteries, or maybe the camera takes up a lot of battery power, but then again, I have not put it down all day yesterday and today. It does not come with a rechargable battery or cord to recharge batteries so it would be smart to keep extra batteries around if necessary. Some of the best things about this camera is that it came with its own memory card which I thought was great. It can only hold a few pictures, but it was an accessory that I did not expect it to come with. You can also purchase a seperate accessory flash to attatch to the top of the camera in the event you may need extra lighting. The camera also lets you shoot movies in which you can zoom. There is also stereo sound which is pretty clear. One of the best features is the ability to take a pic in black and white and have certain things in the background in color. I thought this was great as was the fact that you could adjust and change colors in still shots. I could not possibly explain all the features, but the camera is worth the money and I highly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Versatility and optical clarity in a stubby little package", "Author": "Steve M.

Santiago Jr.", "ReviewID": "R2NXMLHLW5PMZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using Canon Powershot cameras for a number of years now.  I've had the S400, S500, SD550, SD800IS, and now have the SD870IS.  I have been extremely happy with every single one of them.  I now wanted something with a longer zoom lens and considered the SX100 Canon before going ahead and buying the S5IS (read the SX100 has poor battery life).  A friend at work showed me pictures he took with his S3 IS (telephoto moon shots, etc.) and I was very impressed.  At first I thought this camera looked a little busy, maybe difficult to use but it was not.  I actually like it very much.  It looks a little busy because the buttons you need the most are on the camera, not hidden inside a bunch of menus.  The zoom range is incredible.  I can photograph a satellite dish on a house from almost 2 blocks away.  There is a lot of camera shake at that zoom level but the IS feature seems to take care of that because the photos are sharp.  Having shutter and aperture priority is also a very nice feature, along with the auto setting.  The SuperMacro feature is also very nice as I take a lot of close up shots of plant life, coins, jewelry, etc.  The menu system is typical Canon Powershot.  Once you've learned one you won't have any problem moving to this camera.  I have taken over 125 shots already with lots of flash and zoom use, with my first set of Duracell alkaline batteries and no sign of dead batteries yet.  I bought some rechargeable Energizer's but have not used them yet.  I wouldn't call this a great camera, but it sure is pretty darn nice and a pleasure to use.  I also appreciate that it doesn't weigh a ton like other cameras this size.  My Canon powershot will be used as my in pocket carry everywhere camera.  This S5IS I plan to use for sporting events like baseball and boxing, and will also be taking it along on an upcoming cruise to Alaska.  By the way, we have taken thousands of photos with our Canon Powershots and not one of them has ever failed us in any way (knock on wood).  That's why I'm sticking to Canon.5/11/08:  I have now had my camera well over 1 week and have taken approx. 500 shots now.  My son loved the results so much he sold his Sony Cybershot and bought himself an S5 IS and he also couldn't be happier.  We have had so much fun with this camera.  Every once in a while we may get an out of focus image or a grainy one, but the wonderful shots we have taken and the incredible zoom lens just outweigh any minor occasional bad shot.  This is really a great camera for the price and it's quick and easy to learn to use all of the fun features it has, like color swap, color accent, etc.  Battery life has been outstanding considering the size of the LCD screen, constant zooming, flash photos, etc.  This Canon S5 has quickly become one of my all time favorite cameras, and I've been an avid photographer for over 40 years.Only thing I don't like is the image quality when looking through the view finder.  It's much clearer using the LCD screen.  This is not an SLR so I can understand that.  Since I wear glasses it's much easier just to use the LCD screen to compose my shots.Added on 7/9/08 (after trip to Alaska with this camera):This has turned out to be a great camera for me, and one that has been a lot of fun to use.  For what I paid for this camera, in comparison to an SLR with the weight and burden of additional zoom lenses, I couldn't be happier.  I bought this for a cruise to Alaska and I got great results.  No camera is perfect, including this S5 IS, but I am very happy with the results.  There is some noise at high ISO, and there is some purple banding at the maximum zoom, but you know what?  I'm getting photos that I wouldn't be able to get with an SLR and the standard lenses they come with.  With the S5, I don't have to change lenses and I've got a 420 mm zoom lens.  I posted 5 photos or so from my recent trip to Alaska, so please take a look.  I was able to zoom in on bears, birds and got beautiful landscape photos and some nice wide angle shots.  I used rechargeable NiMH batteries and never ran out of battery power in a day of heavy shooting, sometimes as many as 200 photos a day.  I would just recharge the batteries each night just in case and never needed my backups.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Powerful digital camera", "Author": "Marsano", "ReviewID": "R2XQ5PGHH8CG44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Canon S3 IS but it has something missing, when i see this new version with a external flash mount I knew I have to bouy it, gladly it come with some extra features I has enjoy a lot.

The one main flaw I see with the camera is the battery door which is a pain in the butt to operate. I thought I was going to break the camera before I ever got a chance to use it. It's not a simple swing style cover, it's a swing and slide style cover and it makes me nervous every time I have to change batteries. I've seen other reviews where there is complaint about noise, and I don't notice any with mine. I do have some problems with focusing with this camera, but I haven't worked with it enough to know if it's machine error, or operator error at fault. The manual that comes with this camera reads like a chemistry textbook in that it seems overwhelming to the lay person. There is another manual that comes with the camera that helps you turn the camera on and do a few things with it, but ultimately you'll be sent to the big manual for further education. This isn't a simple point and shoot camera. This camera is for those who take their photography a little more seriously than the weekend shooter. The images I am getting are fantastic with this camera and there's no wash out from the flash like many cheaper cameras do. In fact, this camera takes the best low light images of any camera I've ever owned. I'd give this camera a 5 star rating if it weren't for the battery door and complicated manuals that come with the camera. I would suggest a DVD showing how to use the camera as opposed to a book so crammed full of symbols, abbreviations, and what not that the average person sits there and scratches their head over. I'm also a little frustrated at some of the focusing aspects of this camera, but again, is it the camera or the operator? Only time will tell. One last thing, I've seen a big debate over the Japanese vs. Chinese versions of this camera. Mine is Chinese made, and it works like a charm. I don't know if the Japanese vs. Chinese argument holds any water.

However, given most reviews of this camera, this may not be releavant--I certainly hope it isn't.The ProblemAfter your warranty runs out, good luck with any possible product defects; that's why I urge you to buy an extended warranty on an expensive product such as this. Here's some excerpts from an email posted to a CNET thread on the Canon A-610 (for the complete thread, please go to[...])\"I've made two phone calls to Canon Factory with no luck. This morning I spoke with a supervisor named ...who refused to budge. I have a very small dent in the top corner of my camera so naturally that's their excuse for charging me (even though it's been dented for over a year and I've taken well over 1000 pictures since and in spite of the \"known\" CCD problem). I politely mentioned all the cases on dpreview, Amazon and CNET in which consumers are having the CCD problem with their A610's and that Canon HAS made repairs to some A610's free of charge. He quickly and somewhat nastily cut me off saying they don't consider internet reviews as fact. He proceeded to tell me that the A610 CCD has different components than those on the advisory so I asked him who the manufacturer of the CCD was in the A610 and he told me he didn't know... He instead told me that I could have them repair my camera and if Canon later added the A610 to the [\"advisory\"] list my money would be refunded...he wasn't friendly and when I told him to send my camera back unrepaired he said okay and hung up on me...\"Granted, this is NOT the Pro Series camera.  However, I post this only as information about post-warranty experiences (again, you may wish to read the thread, or you may see this as entirely irrelevant to your purchase), and the possible advisability of warranty extension.

However, here is my take on this S5 IS and I want to keep this review real short. I bought this camera just because I didn't want to carry a big SLR everywhere and I thought this would take better pictures than the point and shoots. The camera takes great pictures in brightly lit outdoors. That's about it. The camera is nothing close to a DSLR when it comes to taking close-ups (zoom) or pictures in low light. Most of the pictures I've taken at night or in low light are terrible and there is not a setting or configurationg I've not tried. As many people say this camera is not comparable to a DSLR, not even close to a Nikon D60. Most of the decent point and shoot camera's will do just fine as this S5IS, apart for the zoom and the swivel screen. Trust me.Battery life has been decent, but yeah you put 4 of them in there (I use Duracell re-chargeable which lasts for a day or two roughly 150 shots). Flash photography is good at low light, but a point and shoot can do just fine. Super macro function works well.If I were to get another camera I will get a point and shoot, really, otherwise just get yourself a cheap SLR. This is neither small to carry around nor as good as an SLR.", "Date": "May 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but why get ripped off here???", "Author": "TheRealDeal", "ReviewID": "R21BJ7MRMQJ51T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The ridiculous prices here aren't even CLOSE!

Only the Canon S2~S5 cameras offer uncompressed stereo 16-bit PCM audio in both Video or digital voice recording modes.

I didn't think I'd be able to tell much difference in the pictures since the S5 is only a few steps up, but the difference is huge!  My pictures are so much clearer and the colors are so much more vivid.  If you are considering a powershot, but not sure which one, I'd definitely recommend getting the S5 over any of the A series.As a side story... something interesting that happened to me with this camera the first week I had it...Well, I'm studying abroad in Japan.  I got the camera like the day before I went on a 10 day Japan-wide vacation with my husband and in-laws.  On the last day of my vacation, we were in Hiroshima and wanted to go to the Island of Miyajima to see the shrine lit up at night.  Well, we took a taxi to the station, then took a tram but decided that was going to take too long, so we got off at a random station and took a taxi from there to the Ferry to go to Miyajima.  While we were waiting for the ferry to Miyajima, I realized I didn't have my camera anymore.  I started FREAKING out, not only because the camera, camera bag and memory cards totalled over $400 dollars, but also because all my pictures from my whole vacation were gone with it, all those memories... I cried and tried to use my Japanese at a police box to explain what happened.  It was really difficult explaining that it could be in two taxis or on a tram.  They filed a report, but I never thought I'd see it again.  I told my Japanese friend what happened and asked if she could call some of the main taxi companies in Hiroshima, since there are thousands of them.  She looked it up online and there is a website where most of the main companies are affiliated with and you can report lost items, so she sent a message about mine.  The next day she got a phone call saying they found it and asking for an address.  I gave them my address and received it in the mail the next day.  Cost me 12 bucks for the COD.  Japanese people are so honest!!  In America, that would be the taxi driver's lucky day!There is another funny part to this story as well.  While I was at the police box making the report, I told my mother-in-law to go on to Miyajima so she could take pictures of it for me.  I didn't want the expensive taxi ride to be for nothing!  There were two ferries over, one at 10, and one at 10:24.  She took the one at 10, and got off, ran to take pictures, and came back to the port in Miyajima.  She assumed that since the ferry at 10pm went back to the main island, that the one at 10:24 would also go to Miyajima and then back.  But it didn't, it just stayed in Miyajima.  So, my mother-in-law would not leave the port and kept crying, saying her family was on the other side.  Poor woman, doesn't know a lick of Japanese.  Meanwhile, me, my husband and his dad are on the otherside waiting for her to come back.  Suddenly the lights turn off at our port.  What the heck?  We go to look to see if the ferry is coming in, and we see nothing.  Everything is dark.  So, we forget about the camera and everyone starts freaking out.  I start asking a taxi driver about how we can get over there, and he says there are no more ferries, but he might be able to get his friend to take us across for 20000 yen (200 bucks, 300 both ways).  We have to do it, because we know she is freaking out and scared and alone and probably no one understands her. (Not as many people in Japan speak English as they lead you to believe.) But the taxi driver can't get ahold of the guy, he's sleeping.  THEN the police from the police box come, saying that our mom is at a hotel and will take the first ferry back in the morning.  Apparently, the police from there called the police on the main island.  They took us back to the station to talk to her, and we saw her again at 7am the next morning.  As soon as she got back, we headed straight for the airport, making our flight just in time.  What a way to end a trip, right?Everytime I look at my camera I think of this story!!!", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Una Excelente Camara", "Author": "Omar Ola \"omar ola\"", "ReviewID": "R1SG6N2PB9OAR4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Esta camara es lo mejor que hay por su precio.

However I still prefer my Canon A620 for outdoor shots of kids and animals where I'm looking to catch the cutest moments of action because the A620 has shorter lag times while it saves and prepares for the next shot (when you're not using/needing flash) - the A620 can go click-click-click-click really fast but this one has to click and short wait (it's not really long, I've seen longer, but still....)You can buy adaptors and add lenses or filters which is hard to find in most point and shoots, and it's got a hot shoe for attaching a separate flash.It's bigger than most point and shoots and seems a bit heavy.  The LCD screen rotates into lots of different positions which is SUPER handy for avoiding glare on the screen and for moving the camera into a position your face can't reach (I'm 5'1\" but I can rotate that screen down, hold the camera way above my head and still see the shot I'm composing).I've used my camera quite a bit and it hasn't broken/gotten glitches/need repaired at all - some reviewers report major issues; I think there are a few that are lemons but mine sure isn't.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wouldn't buy a Canon ever again", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2EHJTW3TWENBN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at the birth of my daughter, when I did, I thought that I would at least have a camera to take pictures of her growing up for quite a few years (especially since I paid $400. when it now came out).

No more missing the shot because of my antsy children that can't sit still for more than 1/10th of a second.-Enormous zoom (compared to my old Canon Powershot A7).-Automatic face recognition is cool.-Hot shoe in case you want to bring your own more powerful flash to the party.-Video is good and stereo sound is a plus! Additionally video can be much longer than the 30 second max my old camera had, and you can zoom in and out while the video is recording too.-Fast image transfers to your computer...providing you are using USB 2.0.-I am glad I purchased this camera and no one could beat Amazon's price (and SuperSaver free shipping)...It was money well spent. I may buy a second one so my wife will have one while I am deployed.-For the past 20 years I have only owned Canon cameras and have been increasingly happy with each new model that I have purchased. The optics are always top-notch, the operation is always simple, and the features are always robust.Things to improve upon this already great product:-Wireless/Bluetooth transfers to computer would be awesome.-Canon should start shipping their cameras with larger capacity memory cards. The bundled 32MB card is a joke and can be filled within minutes. C'mon Canon, flash memory is CHEAP put at least a 1GB card in there!-There should be a warning on the box stating you may need to purchase a much bigger hard drive to store the thousands of photos you're going to be taking with the Canon PowerShot S5 IS.-Illegal ninja moves from the government would've been nice to have, but not entirely necessary for the majority of photography applications I guess. ;-)", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Just bought this yesterday - very excited!", "Author": "WilmNHC \"Heather\"", "ReviewID": "R2BZO4LG08629K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all - I am just excited as I can be about getting this camera!

I don't see it listed now and the Canon S5 seems an approximate competitor of the same style.  Both are rather rare creatures and probably deserve better attention.First my background and biases:  I'm an amateur who escapes into photography to take a break from the numeric / financial world in which I work.  The Panasonic FZ 30 is a lightweight compact plastic body with a heck of a Zeiss 400mm lens attached to it.  That is probably very comparable to the Canon S5 and both record 8mp.  I bought mine primarily for outdoor wildlife shots, but over the past two years used it for everything, including a friend's wedding and shooting a glamor session with the then current Playboy Playmate and later for a catalog competition for a clothing company.  I was always competing with photographers with much more expensive Canons and Nikons.Recently I purchased the new Nikon D300 with the 18-200mm zoom for about $2,500 before lots of accessories... purchased because I am getting more into the professional realm of photography and I wanted better low light capability.Looking back, I'm amazed at how much I did with an approximately $500 plastic non DSL camera.DSL cameras have a lot of moving parts and their advantage is to be able to take one lens off and insert another.  Doing so allows dust etc. to get into the camera and the pro version DSLs now have vibration mechanisms to shake that dust down to the bottom of the camera.  Moral: if you keep it simple in the first place, you don't have to pay for that high tech correction.I was in Brazil a few months ago and talking to a pro photographer who said of my old camera:  \"What you have is a great lens with a simple camera attached to it!\"  Exactly.  And that is good.A camera of this type will probably do only mediocre in low light non flash shots in museums or in artistic settings.  It will probably be better than other point and shoot cameras, but not much.  But that's about its only limitation.  My camera and this one from Canon are lightweight, relatively inexpensive, and mass produced to allow a very good lens to be sold at ordinary consumer prices.I used my $2500 new DSLR today in a non flash setting in a museum and got great low light results.  Later I took my dog for a walk along a creek and left the DSLR behind and picked up my old $500 camera with the longer zoom for outdoor shots.I think my $2500 camera is about twice as good as my $500 camera.Hope this helps.", "Date": "May 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon PSC-75 Deluxe Soft Case for S1 IS, S2 IS, and G6 Cameras", "Author": "J.

I feel that cameras have come far enough that this should not even be an issue.Also, many of my issues are very blurry or hazy, BUT, my disclaimer to that is it all may be caused by user error??? I THINK I know how to use the camera, but on the offchance I don't, and I am causing these issues to occur - I am just putting that out there....(I am doubtful this is the case, but you just never know.)I am not overall very impressed or highly satisfied with this purchase.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Horrible Pictures", "Author": "Disappointed Shopper", "ReviewID": "R3UKKS2ZJH5Y4K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Takes horrible pictures.
