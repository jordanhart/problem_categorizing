Lens Cleaning KitZESG26: Digital Camera and Camcorder Screen Protectors for LCD's (pack of 3)ZEUV49: 49mm Multicoated Protective UV FilterAt this point I have not used all of these, and some I may never use. I don't expect to use the gadget bag to store my camera or lenses in, since the one divider is not very impressive, but I will probably use it to store equipment I don't need to cart around everywhere. The SD card works fine. The non-Sony battery works fine (too soon to compare how long it lasts with either the original battery or Wasabi Power Battery (2 Pack) and Charger for Sony NP-FW50 and Sony Alpha NEX-3, NEX-5, NEX-5R, NEX-5N, NEX-6, NEX-7, NEX-C3, SLT-A33, SLT-A35, SLT-A37, SLT-A55V, which also works fine). I have also used the USB card reader and the LCD screen protector, and have no complaints with either of them.I have barely begun using the camera, but there are plenty of reviews available for it already, and I will just mention the bundled items for those wanting a bit more detail than the product description gives. I have noticed that this bundle is not always available, but has come and gone a couple times since I placed my order.Edit: Prices fluctuate, and at the time of this edit there is a small difference in the price of the bundle vs. the camera. I think the biggest value items in the bundle are the SD card and the battery, and spares of those are always welcome, so it is probably worth the extra. And while I bought B+W 49mm Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Coating (010M) and B+W 40.5mm Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Coating (010M) (not knowing what filters were included), I expect the bundled filters are better than nothing. I tried the polarizing filter once, and it made a difference on reflections off of glass, and I didn't notice extra artifacts.Edit (March 13, 2013): I have been using the camera and each of the lenses for awhile now, and would rate Sony SELP1650 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens at 4 stars. The size is convenient, but it comes with some optical compromises that I have had to fix using Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4. However, since I am able to fix them in post processing, I am happy to recommend the lens for general carrying around. You can see more details in my review of the lens.Edit (April 10, 2013): I have used the HDMI cable, and it works. I have discovered that the USB card reader works on some of my SD cards, but not on others: after a long delay recognizing the card, the computer asks if I want to format it - and I don't! The fault does not appear to be with the SD cards, since they all work normally in another reader. And still no problems with the spare battery.Edit (May 13, 2013): I had an opportunity to take extended video at a school play. Some previous NEX cameras have had overheating issues with video, and I wondered how the NEX 6 would behave. I did see the overheating warning indicator come on a few times and the body did feel warm, but it did not actually shut down. I was stopping recording between scenes and had the LCD screen pulled out a bit to help it cool. I turned the camera off during intermission. The indicator came on after about 50 minutes of mostly active recording. I am quite pleased with the video quality and the experience, and the overheating does not appear to be as severe as earlier NEX models, as far as I can tell from their reviews. But heat is an issue when doing extended recording, and care needs to be taken. I have not noticed any noise issues mentioned with prior NEX models. And the NEX-6 does quite reasonable correction of distortion on the 16-50 mm lens when taking video.Edit (May 24, 2013): I noticed that Sunset Electronics is currently the lowest priced (and therefore default) seller, with Beach Camera listed under \"More Buying Choices\". Since the list of items included in the bundle is not given in the description, I don't know exactly what they include in their \"ultimate bundle\". I expect it is more or less the same sort of things that Beach Camera included, but there may be a few differences for all I know. Since I gave Beach Camera's product codes, it is probably clear that they were the ones I got my bundle from, but I wanted to make it explicit and call attention to the fact that there are now multiple suppliers. The lowest priced supplier could change in the future as well.Edit (July 15, 2013): The included card reader (Beach Camera product# XTSDCR) is my #1 suspect in a case of corrupted directories on two SD cards - the corruption happened while the cards were being read by the computer. Recovery software indicated an extremely high rate of read errors, whereas another card reader enabled full recovery of all photos. A similar directory corruption happened once months ago (before I had the recovery software which gives read error counts), and I thought the problem was due to a software conflict and immediately uninstalled the suspected software. Now I wonder whether this reader was the cause of all three corrupted cards. If I later encounter the same sort of corruption without using the card reader, I will note it here. Until then I will certainly not use this reader again, but will do some tests with the SD cards.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony nex 6", "Author": "Antonio Alvarez", "ReviewID": "R3133TY8O2LAJ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this camera and  this bundle makes it even better for almost the same price of just the camera alone.My only problem was with the non Sony (extra) battery. It's  initial charge lasted for quite a long time but after I tried charging it for the first time..I noticed the charging light would shut off almost immediately.I left it charging overnight but never charged. So i ended up throwing that battery away , I didn't want to risk damaging the camera .The Sony battery charges with no problem... so I'll end up buying another battery,  no big deal. .As for the other exteras, So far I've only used the card reader , filters, hdmi cable, blower, and the 32gb Sony memory card with absolutely no problems.As the previous reviewer noted, the bag is not cushioned at all so the only thing I'm using a this bag for is all the accessories, I wouldn't trust it to protect the camera.Even though I had bad luck with the non Sony battery I don't regret going with this bundle.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite camera out to date.", "Author": "Finn Smyth", "ReviewID": "R1SE6S429XON7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This bundle is an incredible deal. Most of the stuff is a budding photographer's dream. It is all of the little things that you forget to buy when you first get your camera. The two lenses are wonderful and the stabilization for filming is a god-send. The camera handles well and is, of course, very compact. It has a solid body that makes you feel as though you didn't miss out on the metal body of the NEX-7. The sensor is delightful allowing great light intake and making full use of my legacy prime lenses. There is a wide range of adapters available so using legacy lenses is a great idea. I have found that FD and Pen F lenses are a great choice. The Pen F have a better fit to the body as the adapter isn't quite as large. The camera set up is simple and the manual setting is a dream with the customizable dials. I left them as is due to my familiarity with the set-up. Overall, this is a great camera and a great camera package.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "maid marian", "ReviewID": "R25T3V900X7XT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose the NEX 6 because it combined the good elements of the 5 and the 7 at a good price and because I have difficulty holding a full sized SLR.

I just love the quality I'm getting from both lenses, and I am continuously impressed by the many features of the NEX-6 as I learn them.  My only complaint is short battery life.  The OEM lasts a third as long as the one in my Alpha 350, and the after-market battery about half of that.The bundle is okay.  The two UV filters were immediately installed.  I'm sure there's better glass out there, but these haven't degraded the images that I've noticed.The polarizer might be useful; I can't imagine ever using the florescent. The camera bag is an El Cheapo, zippers jam, not well designed, and I've already replaced it. The lens cleaning kit, dust blower etc. are cheap throw-ins that every bundle includes; inexpensive, but useful none the less.Bottom line, if you've settled on the NEX-6, which is a great camera, and these two lenses fit your shooting style, then this a grand bargain.OE MONTH UPDATE:  The price has gone up $70.  The \"Sports\" scene isn't too good.  The camera picks an incredible high shutter speed and the frames per second in full sun is pretty slow.  Switching to aperture priority and manually changing the focus and shooting mode, then adjusting the aperture to get a 500-650th/sec shutter speed solves the problem.  That gets me about what i was getting with my A-350 in raw, 6-10 fps with good autofocus on a moving target.  It's a lot of fusing around to get a few shots at the dog park, but the results are fine.The only app I've installed is the free \"smart phone-remote\".  Incredibly cool!  You can see the shot on your phone, then touch the phone to take the shot. I haven't gotten any of the pay apps.  I've seen some results of time-lapse video on YouTube, also very cool.  I may get that one for $10.I have also updated the firmware.  A time consuming 20 minutes, but fairly painless.  It's good to stay current.The in-camera HDR works really well, but it doesn't work in raw. Also cool is the 'hand-held twilight\" mode that takes 5 or 6 really fast exposures in low light high ISO and, combines them to eliminate noise. It's hard to believe a camera in this price range doesn't come with a battery charger and you have to charge in-camera.  I have ordered an after market charge.", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Cristian Fatu \"Portraits, Travle and more..\"", "ReviewID": "R1GN2PX8L3AWFJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera.
