{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Watch out for replacement part availability!", "Author": "Ron Hildebrand", "ReviewID": "R3TGXDCMLB9GYO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is more a review of my experience with SecurityMan customer service, not this specific DVR. My model is the DVR-04.I called today to order another power supply, and that's when I learned the DVR-04 had been discontinued. The person on the other end of the phone put me on hold to see if they had a power supply for it. After a couple minutes, he returned and said they'd have to look \"in the warehouse\" and call me back.I asked two things; how long has this model been discontinued, and, how long until they'd get back to me after they check the warehouse?Reasonable questions, right? Not so the answers:I was informed the SecurityMan DVR-04 had been discontinued about a year ago, which means someone who bought one just about the time it was discontinued may very well not be able to get replacement parts after only one year. (And this is the *second* time in probably a year that my power supply has died.)Granted, my unit is around 3 years or so old, but the point is that even someone who bought this model new just 12 months ago and has a problem with it, may have more of a problem than they may think! What's reasonable here? Should SecurityMan regard what they sell as simply disposable equipment, even if it fails only 365 days after purchase? I can get parts for my 6+ year old 52\" Philips TV right now, but SecurityMan feels no obligation to stock parts even one year after discontinuance? (And this power supply seems to be unique, so you can't just pick one up anywhere.)As to when they'd get back to me about the power supply, I was told \"I don't know--no time frame\". No time frame???? In other words, \"Take a flying leap, my friend, we've moved on. Your problems with our old equipment mean nothing to us\".OK, everyone who thinks either one of these answers equates with even minimally acceptable customer service from SecurityMan, raise your hands!______________________________DECEMBER 2011 UPDATE: No real surprise here, but SecurityMan never did get back to me.I'd suggest staying far away from this unit, or anything else by SecurityMan.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Bad But Cound Be Much Better", "Author": "wediggers", "ReviewID": "RAK6A1Q5QYH4Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been using this for over a year now and it is working great with no trouble.but as far as the software goes there is a lot of room for improvement (and it doesn't seem like they ever release any updates)Pros4ch with motion recording for each channeladjustable sensitivity and areas for motion recordinglarge hard driveeasy to record images or video clips to computer or USB sticksoftware for viewing pretty good over networksconssoftware for playing back really hard to use and almost impossible to search for time or date recordings. you pretty much have to sit there and watch through everything backwards in 16x speed till you see what you want. you can't even jump to another daymotion detection picks up rain and snow (but that is so be expected)overall i got a good deal on amazon and at the time there was nothing close to the price with network and motion recording so i would say pretty good but if i found another brand with the same features and some decent software i would get it instead", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.99", "Features": "VCR-like easy-to-use and reliable embedded standalone DVR.\nVideo Motion Detection (VDM): programmable up to 48 targets for each camera\nTriplex DVR: Able to monitor, record and playback simultaneously.\nNetworkable over LAN/WAN/broadband Internet with fixed IP address.", "Name": "SecurityMan 4 Channel Triplex Network DVR with 250GB USB Motion Detection (NDVR0400)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HSQK8Z2KL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000MDWIOG"}}
