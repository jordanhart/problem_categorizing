There arent much reviews on a camera unless it's totally famous or new. So I bought it because it was sale for mothers day.I have been using it for about a week now, took it to the zoo. It took excellent pictures, and on top of that the video function is just awesome, it looks like a movie when you're shooting it!The only problem with this is how the price when up like crazy in a day or two. The camera bundle (red) was on sale for 120. Then the next day it was 130 (when I bought it), then the following week, I check it goes up to 220, then 200. Now it's in the 150's. Just keep your eye on it, don't buy if its over 150!I would recommend it to everyone, unless you're a professional, then buy a bigger better camera. I am looking forward to taking this to Europe and Asia this summer :DOh it's touch screen too, thought it was cool when I found out by accident.You probably wanna also buy the class 10 memory card for this camera when taking high resolution pictures due to the lag on lower class.

I use a Nikon D5100 and a Canon SX40HS as my higher end cameras but wanted something to just throw around and carry in my messenger bag for daily events. I blog and Facebook and am always shooting pics around town. I had been using a sd700is for the last few years for that purpose but being from 2006 I figured I'de get something more up to date. The A3400is has not let me down, It takes pictures on par with the SX40HS and sometimes can't tell which camera shot what. It's touch screen is easy to use , it's compact and for the money you just can't go wrong. To be honest I just don't have anything I can say that is negative about the A3400IS. Low light, sunny days the photo's are all sharp. It's a great starter camera or just to leave in your bag for that special photo that comes along.

I've had it for almost a week now, and I've got to say that it's almost perfect for the casual photographer.

I like that you can shoot movies by just pushing the red button, instead of having to twist the dial as on other Canon cameras I've owned. Very simple to operate and the shots are great, even in low light. I haven't explored all the options - mainly because I just want a handy point and shoot. I haven't really used the touchscreen either.I agree that it is not very easy to use the screen in sunlight.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "\"Red Bundle\" Digital Camera Bundle", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "RYJ86TC3I79SP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally purchased as a gift this special \"red bundle\" of this camera: this \"red bundle\" includes a nifty black case, the A3400 camera in red, and a 4 GB memory card.Instead I ended up purchasing for her the Canon PowerShot ELPH 110 HS 16.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom Lens and Full 1080p HD Video and returning this one.The primary reasons are that we found the Elph 110 HS excels in low light situations if put in 'manual' mode, and the A3400 does not handle low light as well as the Canon Powershot Elph 110 HS. The Elph 110 HS has a maximum 3200 ISO in manual mode, versus the A3400's 1600 ISO. Neither camera will reach their full ISO in automatic mode, according to Canon. In auto mode, the Elph 110 HS will normally stop around 2200 ISO and the A3400 will stop around 1200 ISO, according to Canon.In addition, the Elph 110 HS records video in HD 1080p at 24 fps or 720p at 30 fps, while the A3400 records at 720p at 25 fps.We tried both cameras and compared images and videos from both cameras, and preferred the images/videos taken with the Elph 110 HS. Although the low light images taken in manual mode look a little \"pushed\" from both cameras, to use a darkroom phrase. I think it's because it is such a high ISO that it is like using a high-speed film and can't look entirely natural.Yet the A3400 does a good job overall; we got bright and pleasing shots with it. So you will get good stills or videos with this camera. Canon makes excellent point-and-shoot cameras so if you choose this one for casual point-and-shoot photography, you won't be disappointed.Both cameras have image stabilization, which means if you have shaky hands, this will make the picture quality look better.This is a great package deal in a camera at a great price. Also, the red is a really nice color. I usually prefer Canon cameras in silver, but the red looks clean, crisp and modern.WHAT'S IN THE BOX (RED BUNDLE ONLY; THE OTHERS ARE ALL ITEMS MINUS THE CASE AND THE MEMORY CARD):* PowerShot A3400 IS* Battery Pack NB-11L* Battery Charger CB-2LD* Wrist Strap* Stylus Pen* USB Interface Cable* CD-ROM* Getting Started Guide* Canon Deluxe Soft Camera Case PSC-2070, Black* 4 GB Class 4 Memory CardWHAT YOU WILL NEED:* If you buy the red bundle, nothing, unless you want a cloth to clean the LCD lens.* A memory card reader or memory slot* If you buy any A3400 camera in any color except for the \"red bundle,\" (which comes with the red camera, case and memory card), you will need a memory card and a case, if you like the protection of a case.WHO SHOULD GET IT:* If you are looking for 720p video* It has 16 MP which produces really crisp images* It has a touch panel LCD that is very convenient* If you'd like to have a bundled camera, case and memory card all-in-one (as of this writing the \"red bundle\" is the only color choice available in this camera).* If you like to shoot photos in low light, if ISO 1600 is enough for your low light needs.Overall, a great value (depending on if you can purchase it at a sale price), especially the \"red bundle\" option (red camera, case plus memory card) which is currently being offered. One could also consider the Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom, although the Elph 100 HS has a 4x optical zoom and not a 5x optical zoom like the A3400, and 12.1 MP instead of the 16 MP of the A3400, but the Elph 100 HS does 1080p video and has a 3200 ISO. Good luck in your quest to find the right camera for your needs.~~>> \"I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.

The touch screen is very easy to use and has several cool preset modes that you can play with. ...And that's about all the good things I can think of for this camera.Picture quality is  a major issue for me. No matter the setting is, it is VERY difficult to produce a sharp image unless you are under a strong, bright sunlight. The pictures all look great on its LCD, but once you see the pictures in their original sizes on the computer, they all tend to be fuzzy around the details. My 6-year-old Canon SD700-IS does way better under the same conditions (although to be fair, SD700 is much heavier though they are about the same size). I don't expect it to create quality shots like a DSLR, but when compare pictures taken with other powershot models that either I owned or my friend owns, this one is a disappointment from Canon.It'll be a fun, stylish, and easy-to-use camera for your children or teenagers, given its touch screen and some of its funky modes such as 'Fisheye' and 'Poster,' but if you are look for picture quality, this will disappoint you.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good little camera for the price....

Hailey \"haileymon\"", "ReviewID": "R3TYU6L8DCZ07B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Gave one of these to my wife for Christmas. She was using an old A520 (I think), 5MP, 5X Zoom. Awful screen. But it does have a real optical view finder. I like that. I love her but, bless her heart, she's just not good with technology. I had to force an iPod and a MacBook on her. Although she shows signs of her inner geek, She actually asked for a radar detector. I digress...The criteria were: Very Small, lightweight, reasonable pixel count, good screen. And able to just keep in her purse. For $70 this is it.Is it rugget as the old S600? No. I don't think anything is anymore. (except L glass lenses.) So I was looking at all comers from all major brands. Nikon and SONY have some contenders but, partly due to the fact that I am a confirmed Canon Devot\u00e9, This seems to fit the bill perfectly. It is indeed small and light weight, it will fit nicely in a small purse. The zoom is not great, but then again, its a compromise between size and function. The stabilized 5x zoom is just fine for the kind of photography she does, and the 16MP sensor gives us enough detail to play with and enlarge images. As for the touch screen, meh. Its a nice shiny widget but, personally I prefer buttons. It feels awkward (to me) to use the touch screen to shoot. It feels unstable. I want a good two-hand grip and elbows locked in. It feels (to me) that changing the grip and moving the fingers around is not stable. The A3400 has lots of modes and enhancements and filters. They're fun but I want the image captured clean. Then I can futz around in CS6 or Lightroom and add the 'artistic' effects. But ya gotta start with a good image. You can do it with this actual pocket sized camera.The camera will also record video in 720p and uses the proprietary Canon Digic4 processor. Its cheap enough that if it gets crushed in her purse, meh, we'll get another one.Spousal Unit likes it. It lives in her purse. She takes more pictures than when she used that clunky 520.

In between I purchased another brand, (that I will not name here, but the name rhymes with icon) - anyway, I found my Canon camera amazing to work with. I easily shot several thousand photos with that original Canon Elph. After a while I had a minor issue with my Canon, and I found their customer service to be among the best in business. They were very professional, and a pleasure to deal with. I also had a major problem with the other brand, and found their customer service to be totally incapable of even responding to my requests for information. As a result of this, and because my experiences with the actualy Canon camera was everything it was touted to be, I decided to stick with Canon products. My original instincts with my Canon were correct, and for that reason, as well as because of the amazing features that came with both cameras, I have decided to stick with Canon products from here on out. My first Canon was less than 4 megapixels, and I loved it. My current Canon, the model listed here, is 16 megapixels and has touch-screen capabilities.

The main problem is the complete LACK OF SHARPNESS. Every picture comes out BLURRY, all detail is LOST, and there's a noticeable LACK OF CLARITY and crispness around edges, even when using flash. You can tell the pictures are going to be blurry even before you take them just by looking at the already-fuzzy preview in the LCD. The lack of sharpness problem is only exacerbated by the EXTREME GRAININESS. This camera overcompensates for camera shake by using ridiculously high ISO speeds, up to 1600 ISO. The graininess present, especially with indoor and/or dark pictures, is simply appalling. I have seen camera phones take better pictures than this thing. The pictures taken with this camera have the unwanted distinct appearance of an OIL PAINTING. Plus the pictures are consistently OVEREXPOSED and the colors are WASHED OUT, FADED and DULL. Also there is some noticeable VIGNETTING around the corners of images.I have adjusted every setting on this camera in both Auto and Program (P) modes to correct this overall problem, and to no avail. Maybe I just got a dud, but even then the problem would be inconsistent manufacturing, which means you have a 50/50 chance of ending up with one as bad as mine.Putting and keeping the camera in Program (P) mode and reducing the ISO to 100 (or 200 at the most) is basically a requirement if you expect to at least pretend to be happy with the results. Unfortunately there are no provisions for adjusting picture sharpness at all, unlike with some other makes of cameras. It will take some heavy editing on a PC for exposure compensation, contrast/brightness adjustment, saturation increase and color enhancements just to make the pictures useable. And of course, true image quality cannot be accurately assessed except when viewing them on a high-quality PC monitor, as about all camera LCD screens make images look better than they actually do.I took comparison shots with this camera and my 5+ year old Samsung S630 camera, which much to my surprise did a lot better than this camera. The Samsung produces surprisingly clear, crisp, vivid, sharp, detailed images that this camera can't seem to match. Seems strange since this camera is nearly 3x more powerful than the old one.Other complaints: The flash unit looks too small; it's about 1/2 to 1/3 the size of the Samsung's flash unit. As a result, flash-fired shots often look \"underpowered\". The buttons are too small and too recessed (especially the movie button, although it is convenient). I wish they were more like those on the similar Canon A1300, which are larger and laid out better (and has a seperate viewfinder). The battery/memory card cover can be hard to open.All that said, where this camera seems to do well is in recording movies. Even at 720p, the picture quality is crisp and clear. If only this camera would take still pictures with the same degree of sharpness and clarity, it would be about perfect. The image stabilization for movies works pretty well. And it's nice to start recording just by pressing the dedicated movie button, without having to switch camera recording modes. But please note that all movies, although with HD picture, will be in MONO, NOT stereo.A few other good points about this camera: The design and styling is overall very nice, even in red. It's a nice size, lightweight, and easy to hold. The Touchscreen is actually fun to use and works really well for browsing through images and zooming in and around images. The dedicated movie button is convenient. The included rechargeable battery is decent enough, and seems to last for about a day of average picture taking before having to be recharged.But ultimately it's the image quality that counts, and that's where this camera simply fails.[WHAT'S IN THE BOX]The cameraCanon rechargeable Lithium-Ion batteryBattery chargerWriststrapStylus (for use with Touchscreen)PC interface USB cableGetting Started guideWarranty cardPC CD-ROM containing camera user guide, drivers and photo importing/editing software[WHAT YOU'LL NEED]SD memory card with at least 1GB capacity recommendedCamera case (optional)USB memory card reader or slot (your PC may already have a slot installed)[THE NUMBER ONE BEST THING ABOUT THIS CAMERA]Movie quality[THE NUMBER ONE WORST THING ABOUT THIS CAMERA]The images it takes.BOTTOM LINE, it's a nice little camera, but you're supposed to be enjoying and looking at the images it takes, not the camera itself.[WOULD I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS CAMERA?]No.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Seemed a bit too cheap for the price.", "Author": "belizeanbuay", "ReviewID": "R3C48WU5QH8ILF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera seemed a bit too cheap for the price.

In fact, I bought this camera because I wanted to replace an old 5mp canon powershot, which technically worked fine, but, not having any kind of image stabilization, meant my photos always came out blurry. I wouldn't have bothered with a new one if the reviews here hadn't been decent and the price super-cheap for a 16mp from a trusted company.Pros:--The picture quality, to my non-professional eye, is pretty darn good. Colors are real-to-life but vibrant, auto settings seem to work well indoors with relatively dim light.--Image stabilization is GREAT. Per my notes above, this was a vital feature for me; my hands shake slightly, without image stabilization, I can't take a picture that doesn't have some level of blur. I've managed to snap about 20 pictures on this one, most of them without even bothering to try and hold the camera particularly steady, and they came out clear.--Touch screen: this wasn't a factor in my selection, so it was a surprise to me that i immediately started using the touchscreen more than the buttons - it was responsive, and the icons are mostly large enough to select easily, even with big fingers.Cons:-- the body and charger feel cheap. My previous camera, from nearly 10 years ago, is all-metal in the body, feels solid and good quality; of course, it was a $400 camera at the time, and I picked this one up for $95 after tax, so I wouldn't necessarily expect them to be the same quality. It was just a bit surprising to see the shiny, pretty front, then pick it up and find out the back was a kind of ugly brown plastic.Overall, for the features you're getting, and the current sale price, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal. This seems, so far, like a great camera for the casual user who wants to be able to take nice pictures. Especially if you, like me, only take photos once or twice a year, and really don't want to invest a lot of money in a camera.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't be fooled by the low price...Highly Recommend!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R37BEEVUMYSSDK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the second camera I bought...the first was a more expensive Samsung ST200F which I promptly returned because the interface was so clunky - it took way to long to get through the menu and options.

I LOVE it!!Far exceeding my expectations, this cheap little camera takes excellent pictures, has a touch screen to get through the menu quickly, even in shooting mode, and has a lot of fun features.  I have shot almost all my Christmas pictures in \"toy camera mode\" which softly blackens the edges and gives a warm nostalgic feel to any photo.  Close up shots are crystal clear in most lights, the zoom is decent, but not amazing.  The stabilization is excellent even on no-flash settings, which I use most and I have very shaky camera hands.My only real complaint is the dinky noise it makes when you use the zoom.  I almost sent it back the first day because of it, but after giving it a test run, I love the pictures it takes waay too much.  Its kinda like a great car which has a dinky horn.I'm not a master photographer, but for an average family this is taking fantastic pictures.

I was replacing a 9 year old Sony DSC-V1 that has gotten pretty ragged over the years.Pros:- battery life has been very good in my experience- good zoom- one touch video recording- pictures are goodcons:- when recording video if the focal length changes you hear a 1-2 second buzzing sound in the video while the focus adjusts.  basically makes the video unwatchable for those 1-2 seconds.- shutter delay is longer than most cameras.  easy to miss pictures if you are taking pictures that aren't posed.- the auto flash can be inconsistent which can lead to blurry pictures at night.- touchscreen is not really that useful.overall I wasn't sure what to expect since I had never owned a point and shoot before.  The DSC-V1 I was used to was a little more on the higher end side than this camera and so it has more features.  I was looking forward to a camera that I could whip out, take some quick snaps and put back in my pocket.  However, I found the picture taking to be less easy than I was hoping for.  Pressing the button to take pictures would sometimes quickly take a picture and sometimes not.  Sometimes the autoflash would fire and sometimes not.At Disney World we were often giving the camera to Disney photogs to take our picture and many of those shots ended up being blurry and unuseable.

It has given me nothing but aggravation from day one. Do yourself a favor and spare yourself all that aggravation.Honestly, this is the first review I've ever written. I'm not the type to write reviews, but I feel  a responsibility to tell other buyers what I wish I knew before I purchased this piece of junk, in order to spare other people the disappointment I suffered following this most unfortunate purchase. I have a very busy schedule and limited online access so I would only write a review if I'm REALLY riled up, which I am.Right away when I bought it, I saw that the camera was not a good camera and wanted to exchange it for a better model. I didn't feel like spending all that money for a mediocre camera. So within 30 days of purchase and with the original receipt I went down to the retail store I bought it from and they refused to take it back. I called Canon directly and they also refused to exchange it for me because I didn't buy it from them directly.I bought it to replace an almost 7 year old Canon SD400 which was still working but going bad (it was 7 years old after all). I was happy with that camera but towards the end of its life the pictures were really blurry. So I decided to invest in a good camera that would last. I just needed a decent camera that would take good pictures when I needed them. I barely use my camera but I just want to have one for when I need it. I wasn't looking for professional grade or fancy features. Just a good decent camera that would take good pictures and last. I had good faith in Canon at that point. So I was only looking to buy a Canon since it's supposed to be a good company. What can I tell you, I was extremely disappointed; this is not what I expected from Canon.I have to admit, it is a nice looking camera (I have the silver) and I liked the size. But the picture quality is TERRIBLE. Takes awful, blurry pictures. (I noticed now that many other reviewers had the same issue, so this is not an isolated case). I did not invest in a new camera to get a disappointment like this. And the touchscreen is not even so great. In fact, I didn't realize it had touch screen till someone pointed it out to me.After everyone refused to exchange it for me I was terribly disappointed and felt ripped off, but after the initial disappointment was able to live with it (though still very unhappy with the camera). But after just a few uses the camera malfunctioned and simply REFUSED TO START.  Got it to work again, but this happened a few times and now is just not starting no matter what. And the camera is still brand new with only a handful of uses. (Just to give you an I idea of how often I use my camera: I own one memory card that has less than 1 gig of memory. That memory card has 4 years worth of pictures on it- and still has available space!)All in all, I was terribly disappointed in the quality of this camera and feel I paid lots of money ($129.99 on sale, $179.99 original price) for a piece of junk. Main issue was picture quality, and then malfunctioned after a few uses.
