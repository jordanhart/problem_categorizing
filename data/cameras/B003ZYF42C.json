One thing that I have found that I am not clear as to the why is the limitation of 10 minutes or 2 gigs for video, but for this camera, video is a bonus feature, NOT a primary focus.

Before I made my purchase I had came down to 3 choices from all cameras I looked for - Canon T1i/T2i and Nikon D3100. And I chose D3100 for its great and competitive features and equally important its better pricing as compared to Canon counterparts.I brought Canon T1i first from local retail shop and used it for a week and I also took D3100 and compared both in home. I took different snaps with both Canon T1i and Nikon D3100. After comparing multiple indoor and outdoor pictures, I came to my conclusion that - T1i was slightly better than D3100 indoor but D3100 was way better than D3100 in outside snaps. Another factor was price which was very important when you chose on DSLRs because you should get the best value for your money. I found D3100 pricing better than Canon T1i looking at all similar features they are offering. Then I decided that I am going to keep my D3100 and return Canon T1i. Again Canon T1i/T2i are great cameras but for me looking at all necessary DSLR features I needed and pricing, I felt D3100 is best choice. It offers all important features that Canon T1i/T2i offers and some very new that are exclusive to D3100. And D3100 is cheaper than T1i/T2i so it is best value for money.I am using D3100 a lot now and I have to say I made the correct choice. It captures awesome snaps. Its auto focus is OK- not perfect but not bad. It has great HD video feature but I dont shoot video a lot so I dont care on it. As far as picture quality and editing features, D3100 rocks as my first DSLR. I took extra 55-200 mm VR lens along with regular kit lens and all set is working great for me. Do get a good camera bag for your kit. I am enjoying in my photography world !", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "JUST BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Ravi Patel", "ReviewID": "R1TT9QUSP5UJKC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK so i'm a high school student who was interested in photography ever since i took my first photography class. I loved all the things relating or about photography. I always used to use some point and shoot camera but not anymore. I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA and couldn't be more happier. This is a superb DSLR for the money. It has FANTASTIC & CRISP IMAGES. I  can't afford a 1,000+ DSLR so i bought this one. This still is a great DSLR. I currently own the kit lens but they still gives some of the best quality photos i ever took. i posted some of my sample images. One thing that I don't like about this DSLR is the 10 minute limit in movie recording but oh well. after all it is a DSLRR and not a camcorder. I plan to get more lenses and may post some test pics later on. Bottom line, BUY THIS DSLR, and never a canon.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Jean M.

I've had it slightly over six months, sufficient time to evaluate it. The camera does everything that Nikon says it does and has operated flawlessly. The lenses are lighter and feel like there is some 'play' in the focusing compared to old SLR versions. I haven't found much utility in the VR function, but the autofocusing gives generally excellent results. The learning curve for operating the D3100 is a much bigger digital version of the old SLR. The best part of acquiring the D3100 is that my interest in imaging has been rekindled in a really big way. The Amazon purchase process was fast and easy to accomplish.
