What I like about the G9 over the G7:1. Bigger screen (3.0\" vs 2.5\") - with no apparent decrease in battery life.2. Picture quality is better. I have done many parallel tests using the exact settings on both cameras (with the exception of the 12 vs 10 MP of course) and the results have been clearly more favorable towards the G9 in terms of light metering and sharpness. The G9 has a new metering system as well as a more advanced focusing system too.3. RAW option is great. Even though most pics will be taken using JPEG (to conserve memory space), you know it when you've got a great landscape with just the perfect lighting conditions that you know may result in a printable pic, in which case you will want to have a raw copy for processing it to the highest potential.4. Timelapse photo functionality is a very nice to have option which the g7 lacks5. The physical handling of the camera is better, the front has more grip.6. Some other design aesthetics have also gone into the g9 which I prefer.7. Noise levels are exactly the same as in the G7. I tested both up to 400 ISO (I would not use anything higher that that) many times and the speculations found on the internet forums that the higher number of pixels would result in more noise is simply incorrect - at least in my ability to see it in my tests.* the only thing I dislike in the g9 over the g7 is that new usb connection door mechanism. It feels like it may one day break even with proper use. The \"slide out\" door (like the battery door) mechanism was so much better in terms of use and possible durability.If I were a G7 owner (and you could not return it because you've had it longer than 30 days) I would not upgrade as the g7 is a superb camera - but if you were looking to buy a new camera the g9 is a better choice over the g7. The g9 is the perfect camera alternative to a bulky SLR - without the loss of total photographic control or quality.

Kaufmann", "ReviewID": "R2JDECIQHTH3UE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're a photographer who cares about image quality, and can't always lug around a DSLR, buy this camera.  You will have no regrets.I've had its predecessor, the G7, for about a year.  It has been my normal always-in-the-bag camera.  The G7 was limited at ISO 400; the G9 isn't.  My normal workflow with the G9 is to use CS3 to import RAW images (fixing chromatic abberation on the way into CS3 in 16-bit mode), and then to use Noise Ninja to clean up image noise.  With this workflow, ISO 400 and ISO 800 are completely usable.  (You can also play with some other settings in Adobe Camera Raw, like Recovery.)And for everyone: you really should never, ever use a built-in strobe on a camera.  The G9 (like the G7) has a hot shoe.  Use it!Canon fixed a bunch of the G7's problems in the G9, the most glaring of which is the G9 now has a battery meter!  (I can't tell you how much that lapse bugged me.)  The new LCD monitor is much, much bigger -- and gorgeous.  And best of all, the camera body is the exact same size and shape, and fits in my underwater housing.  (Update: not all the buttons work.  The most glaring problem is possibly the zoom can't be changed, and that you can't change to macro mode underwater.  I'll probably get the new housing, but the existing one is functional.)Nits: the new cover for the USB connector is a downgrade, but one that I can put up with.  The lens is unchanged, and has a fair bit of barrel distortion at its widest angle.  You can clean up the barrel distortion somewhat in CS3, but straight horizontal lines become slightly wavy.  I'm being hyper-picky here, but please know that you're not replacing a DSLR with a prime wide angle lens.  You're just buying a small camera that you can take anywhere.Buy it.  Shoot lots of pictures with it.

That's almost thirty years using kit like the Olympus OM-1 (my first love, too bad it was stolen!), Pentax MX, numerous lenses, professional flash equipment like Vivitar 283 and Sunpak 383.  My cousin asked me to shoot her wedding, so I thought maybe the time had finally come to switch to digital.Okay, so maybe I'm old school, and maybe I have some unrealistic expectations for modern equipment, but every time I looked at the digital SLR offerings, I was disappointed.  Even the Nikons (well, the affordable ones like the D70 and D80) were polycarbonate bodies with plastic lenses.  Not professional-grade.  Do you have to pay thousands of dollars to get a metal-bodied SLR today?  Something built to withstand a 5 fps motor drive, like in the old days?  Well, I looked at the Pentax K10D -- metal body, reasonably affordable, fully compatible with all my lenses -- but I just had this vague sense of dissatisfaction.  These fragile contraptions are big, clunky, dare I say dorky compared to an old film SLR.  Hey, and don't let any dust get on the sensor.  Sheesh, talk about wearing kid gloves.Then a friend told me about the Canon G9.  Whoa, paradigm shift here, folks.  I hadn't considered a non-SLR, but I sure am glad I did.  This thing has pro-grade features:  aperture and shutter priority modes as well as full manual exposure, manual focus, RAW capability, decent optical zoom range, spot metering, a hot shoe that works with all my existing flash gear, and many other things that usually only make it into SLR's.For example, with most P&S; cameras, shutter lag is a huge problem.  Good portraits demand instant shutter response.  The G9's shutter is almost instantaneous SO LONG AS you half-press to lock the focus, and compose with the optical viewfinder (i.e, turn the LCD off).  I am getting great portraits of my kids using this technique, and it does feel a bit like using an old Leica rangefinder.  Never understood why anyone would give up an SLR; now I get it.  Quiet, easily concealed, doesn't announce \"I AM A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER!\" or otherwise make you look or feel like a dork.  The optical viewfinder zooms pretty closely with the lens, and parallax has not been a problem.  I wear eyeglasses and the viewfinder works just fine with them; in fact, better than with my MX.  When using the viewfinder, the LCD just displays important camera information:  shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation, stuff like that.  I've found it's pretty easy to glance down at the LCD to check those things, then return to composing in the viewfinder.For those moments when I really need to see exactly what's in the frame, I switch to composing with the LCD.  This is handy to set the manual exposure, too.  I shot some pics of my kids in front of the fireplace and in front of the Christmas tree, with available light, and I just dialed down the shutter speed in manual mode until the exposure looked right in the LCD.  And what an LCD -- again, it's SLR-grade.Overall, the build quality is phenomenal for this price.  It feels solid.  Others have compared it to a tank, or a swiss watch, or a Leica.  It is very enjoyable to hold and use.  Taking pictures is fun again!Video capability is a bonus, too, that you won't find on SLR's.  I'm not a big video shooter, but I have two young kids and there'll be times when I want it.  Back when I was looking at SLR's, I always figured I'd need to purchase a separate (cheap) video camera, maybe a Pure Digital Flip model.  Not anymore.The G9 is not perfect.  Some shortcomings can be overcome or compensated for, while others simply can't.  I am disappointed with the noise above ISO 200.  Autofocus is not as fast as an SLR.  Wide-angle zoom isn't as wide as I'd really like.  The retractable lens looks a bit fragile to me.  I recommend the Lensmate lens adapter for when you think you might bump into things.  It's anodized aluminum, so it's rugged; unfortunately, it really sticks out into the optical viewfinder, cutting off about half the view.  Well, that's when you go with the LCD, I guess.  Works of man fall short of perfection, and all gear has strengths and limitations.  Learn them and use them, or work around them as best you can.  There are lighting conditions that NO digital handles well, and for those, I'm happy to continue shooting film.But for everything else, I'm really happy with the portability, control, responsiveness, and quality of the G9.  All things considered, especially that it's less than half the price of a D80 or \"serious\" DSLR, it is a great camera.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Review compared to G7", "Author": "RonAnnArbor", "ReviewID": "R1X9G8IO0PWZ67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the opportunity to get my hands on the G9 a week ago and have used it exclusively for the past week.Based on my personal observations (And I loved the G7):I see practically no differences in Image Quality at all. I thought the G7 was superb, and I find the G9 to be superb.The 12 MP is practically indifferent from the 10 MP on the G7. Sure it gives you slightly more pixel to play with for cropping and printing, but negligibly so.The design is virtually the same -- the screen is a bit larger, but for all practical purposes it looks and feels the same. I don't see any difference in \"brightness\" on the screen -- it looked great on the G7 and it looks great on the G9.THere is a slight contour change on the front with a barely noticable front grip molding -- maybe 1/16 inch more than the original. I honestly can't feel a difference although some users have.It does have RAW - a feature I don't need nor do I plan to use. But its nice that it is there for those who want it.The ISO and noise appears to be the same -- the G9 excels at night neon shots - just like the G7. I see no difference in noise between the two cameras.The shutter lag is exactly the same as the G7 - I don't see any difference like some reviewers have mentioned... it seems exactly the same.Some say that the optical view finder works better - that it is clearer with less parallax. I have never used an optical view finder on a point-and-shoot in my life, so I can't compare this feature. I will add that here, though, since others have found it a useful improvement.I also don't see any difference in battery life -- maybe its more problematic if you use RAW, but I've gotten the same 450 plus shots out of the battery, just like the G9.The design of the lens and the connections are the same, so I expect those of us who carry it around in our pockets are going to have the same dust problems we had with the G7.Finally in similarities -- the camera feels the same and weighs the same. It responds the same when you start it up, and it makes just as much noise as the original. The trademark Canon grinding lens noise is intact.in differences: that old 2GB card that used to get 800 shots at 10 MP now gets 600 shots at 12 MP.The autofocus seems slower on the G9.Macro shots do not focus as quickly or as well on the G9. There are some shots that I routinely was able to quickly use macro for on the G7, that now require quite a bit of futzing to get sharp and focused in the G9. I suppose that is one of the changes because of the larger sensor, but I don't know. I actually thought there might be something wrong with the camera, but looking at another G9 at a different camera shop (so it wasn't the lot number) I was able to reproduce the same difficulty focusing with Macro as on my personal G9, so it's apparently a camera thing.The long and the short of it -- I don't think it is worth the Upgrade if you have a G7 unless you really really want the RAW. For all other practical purposes, it's the same on a day-to-day usage level.If you are new to the Canon Powershot G line, then skip the G7 and purchase the G9 -- it is like \"G7 SuperCharged\" -- while in general the two are identical.  THe G9 is actually less expensive than the G7 as well.", "Date": "September 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "about as good as it gets in a compact camera", "Author": "Arifyn \"arifyn\"", "ReviewID": "R3FILARL5QA2HG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my G9 for a few weeks now and am very pleased. Image quality is top-notch for a non-SLR and the ability to shoot in RAW format is inidspensible. I've also used the G7 quite a bit previously and thought people might be interested in a comparison between the two.In short, if you already have a G7 and don't need RAW support, you won't see any huge advantage to the G9. However, anyone worried that the G9 will have greater noise issues due to the greater megapixel count will be reassured to know that, even at high ISO, the G9 seems to take slightly better pictures than the G7. Of course both are still pretty noisy at high ISO compared to a dSLR or even Fuji's Finepix f-series, but for overall picture quality and features I'd still go with the Canon unless high ISO shots are your primary focus.Users of the G7 will find a few menus reorganized, which is mildly inconvenient. The shortcut button makes it easier to set custom white balance modes but you can no longer use it to switch image stabilization on or off; you'll have to go through the menu for that. On the other hand the new screen is easier on the eyes, and despite the increased size the battery life is about the same.As others have mentioned, the one serious disadvantage to using this camera *now*, if you like working with RAW, is inconsistent support for the new RAW file format of the G9. It works reasonably well with the latest camera raw driver for Photoshop CS3, and I have no problem working with it in Adobe Lightroom, but it's not yet supported by iPhoto and the default exposure settings sometimes seem to be misinterpreted by other apps, so photos require more tweaking to \"develop'. If you have a previous version of Photoshop or another program you can use the free Adobe DNG converter to convert the files, but this is an inelegant solution. Software updates will undoubtedly resolve these problems, but it's disappointing that Canon chose to introduce yet another proprietary format.", "Date": "September 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great point & shoot for a pro", "Author": "Brett Harkey", "ReviewID": "RY0KIRBGEZAIU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a professional landscape photographer and I wanted a small point & shoot to have handy to grab pictures of my family as well as keep in the car at all times.  The G9 delivers on all counts.  I was waiting for Canon to release a point & shoot that could capture in RAW format, and when I heard about the G9 and after hearing lots of great things about the G7, I knew this would be the camera for me.  The G9 is built like a tank for a point & shoot, captures beautiful images and is easy enough for my wife to use!  My only beef is that the images get quite noisy at ISO's above 200, but that's the nature of the small sensor in a point & shoot.  In most cases, it delivers very clean images.  I like the manual dials on the top that allow me to very quickly choose the shooting mode and ISO.  This is also a great camera to shoot in scenarios when you want to be a little more inconspicuous - great for street shooting.

This is the perfect camera for street photography.  It takes much sharper pictures than the typical point and shoot and it is much easier for me to carry around than my Canon XT.  (I keep it in my messenger bag when I walk around the city.)The 2 downsides:1) Noise.  The pictures are definitely noisy indoors, no matter how much light.  However, it's not any worse than your typical P&S.;  (It is worse than DSLR for sure though)2) Poor quality control.  SHAME ON CANON.  I'm on my fourth unit.  All of them have been defective:a) Green cast on LCD edges when the LCD is black.b) Tilted/crooked LCD screenc) 4 bad pixels (two red and two white)d) Green case on LCD TOP AND BOTTOMI've given up on getting a good unit and am keeping the last one.  Of all the potential defects I've seen, the green cast on the LCD is the least bothersome (since you can only see it on dark images; in most normal cases you can't really detect it).  Much rather have a bad screen than bad pixels.I don't think I've really seen non-defective units of the G9....maybe at B&H; at the store (where I bought mine), but now I think the lighting in the store just made it difficult to detect the defect (since when I looked at mine at the store, it was really hard to see the defect in the store lighting for some reason).Again, I'm REALLY disappointed in Canon's quality control.  They made a great camera, but not a single one I've seen is defect free.  This is the only reason why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5.  This also gives me great hesitancy to buy other more expensive Canon products.  ($500 for the G9 is not chump change, but I can live with bad qualtiy for good design.  If I spent $1,500 on a Canon 40D and had a bad screen or hot pixels I would totally go nuts.)In addition, in reading many online forums on this issue, it seems that no one has gotten Canon to even acknowledge the LCD defective screen exists.Finally, I give Amazon 5 stars for their customer service.

This is a long one.", "Author": "sap \"sap\"", "ReviewID": "R186GAYI9RX9BK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i would highly recommend heading over to luminous landscape and reviewing the travel article about a trip one of these took to japan in the hands of an expert, Nick Devlin.  i think it very realistically sums up the capabilities of this camera far more accurately than a lot of the sourness you read here.I've owned and used several canon S and G series cameras in this range. Before the advent of affordable DSLR cameras my assessment would be different than it is now, much more harsh perhaps.  Many of us vacillated to these from film SLR's because they were the only show, but the world has changed.  DSLR's were out of reach as they were crazy expensive, so cameras like this, at the upper end of the PS scale (dubbed \"prosumer\"), had some big shoes to fill and were labored with high expectations.  All of this history is crammed in 5 or 6 short years; the velocity of change has been incredible. Today is no different than it was then, this is not a do all, end all camera and I don't think Canon means it to be. One main distinction is that the ranks have thinned and many of its features can only be found in a rangefinder camera if you go all the up the food chain the Leica M8.  It is not a beginner's camera, unless that person wishes to learn about the fine points of photography. A DSLR is quite simply a better deal and can be had for about the same money as the G9, but the price you pay is bulk.This is an advanced piece and it fills some very specific purposes, but it is not for everyone. I get the impression from many that they expect it to be a viable replacement for an SLR and it is not.The G9 will produce excellent results, easily approaching what can be got out of an SLR in many situations, but it can take a lot more work to get those results and the images may have some noise or contrast issues in extreme cases.It does have a major flaw in viewfinder coverage and parallax, but it is clearly left on there as a bail out. In case of low battery or for some discrete times or in high contrast conditions it can make the difference between getting the shot and missing out. You can use it, but it requires some creativity and practice. This is not unique to this camera, but common to the breed. It seems worse since there is such a huge focal length range to cover, but these optical VF's on all brands of cameras have always been marginal at best. One thing I do miss, though, is the swivel LCD. That was always a gas to use, but it also made the G (G2/3/5/6) cameras bigger and fatter than the S's (S30/30/45/50/60/70/80). Once I could afford an SLR, all I owned was the S's. Now I think Canon has kind of blended both lines into one, and I can live with what the G9 is fine; kind of an S series on steroids.The LCD might look a little cool in color temp, but saying it's got a blue cast and suggesting that it's not usable sounds like looking for something to complain about. I didn't buy and don't use the G9 as an image viewer, but as a tool to make them. All the LCD is meant for is basic shot framing and exposure review. Canon have done a splendid job in the live and shot review settings (live histogram, all the image details you could want) making this large LCD a great tool. No blue cast is evident in the final images (jpeg or raw), so what difference does a cool LCD make? If lighting is an issue and if the user is trying to control the output, the only real way (with any camera) to insure the final color balance is to shoot raw anyhow, so again, I just don't see an issue here, at least not where I'm sitting. I also own the SD850, and side by side I just don't see anything to carp about with either.I travel extensively and bring the G9 everywhere as I can't always carry my DSLR gear. I have found that I \"need\" one of these to satisfy my addiction.  There is simply nothing else on the market that can offer the features and produce the results in such a compact package at such an affordable price (sometimes at any price). This one shows that Canon still sees this a viable niche to fill, and the G9 is the best of them I've used, all things considered. If Canon would design in a legitimate viewfinder, and if the lens could pick up a stop or 2 in speed and go wider on the short end, I think more serious photographers would own one. There would be no choice, unless you had the cabbage to carry the Leica. You just have to learn to compensate for the parallax, or frame more often with the LCD as things stand now, or go without. I think it's a shame if anyone ignores the G9 who is serious about making top quality images and needs the portability.

I have a Canon SLR (the 10D), and it's hard to beat the SLRs for taking a picture exactly when you press the shutter, though the G9 is no slouch in reaction time--and it will fit in my pocket, where the 10D requires its own pack.I did a lot of research when choosing the G9, but I had some pretty specific criteria I wanted to satisfy: Long digital zoom, RAW-capable (no G8), very portable (jacket pocket, not ultra-portable), and a flash hot shoe. It's a small camera--smaller than the flashes I tend to attach to it (like the Sigma EF 500 DG Super), but after learning how much better an external flash could make my photography look, I never wanted to go back. If you want the best facial tones you've ever seen, bounce a flash off a white ceiling rather than using the internal flash. The results are incredible.The screen is huge, the video quality is excellent, and the 6x optical + 4x digital zoom brings your total zoom to 24x, and at that magnification you still get a 1600x1200 photo (using digital zoom effectively crops in-camera)--which won't make a very good poster, but is more than enough to make a decent 4x6, and is huge if you're taking pictures for a web page. While you can certainly crop photos later, the extra zoom allows you to tell the camera what it is in the frame you're interested in--and then it can auto-focus on exactly the point you mean, just scan the interesting area for faces, or what have you. A great feature IMHO.Just turning this camera on is AMAZING. It must be less than a second from when you hit on to when the lens has extended and it's ready to take a picture--actually faster than my old 10D! It has a quiet zoom, and the auto-face-recognition is pretty magical, though it doesn't perform as well on a face in profile.I love the animated user interface, too--a minor bit of polish for sure, but it's yet another thing to be happy about. :)Negatives: Well, I have the Canon 10D, the old PowerShot G1, and a Canon MiniDV Camcorder that all use the same battery type (Canon BP511A), and so it was a bit of a bummer having to use a new charger and battery for the G9--though it's smaller, and as a result the camera can be smaller, so it was a minor price to pay. The G1 also had a fold-out swivel screen, which was great, and I do miss it on the G9--though the G9 has a HUGE screen, so again it's a trade-off.If you're not used to holding the shutter down half-way to prefocus, it's not the fastest at locking on a focus and taking a shot--but just about no auto-focus pocket-cameras WILL focus from scratch really quickly, at least none that I'm aware of. If you do learn to press halfway to set up the shot in advance, it's decently fast for a non-SLR--and you can set it to \"Kids and Pets\" mode to encourage it to prefocus as much as possible.In any event, it's my new favorite camera.

I wanted to upgrade to a small P&S; that would have great image potential and would give the controls of a DSLR.

It is the most advance P&S; camera I've every used and in some respects is more advanced that my 40D. I don't shoot in \"MODES\" very often, so most of the consumer features are meaningless to me. The face recognition is interesting and works as advertised. Having a flash hot shoe really makes this camera nice for night work. Although my 580EX flash is larger than the camera.

Generally, I found that the camera works well. The \"usage modes\" do less than you might suppose; I ended up going with aperture-priority much of the time. The ability to shoot videos was nice, but only at slow velocity (an attempt to film the ground speeding by underneath a flying helicopter resulted in a long, green blur). Audio annotations worked well.The camera is easy to use, at least if you've dealt with Canon's digital cameras before. I've not had to read the manual yet.

When I came to US i decided to buy a new camera. I wanted a high end Point & Shoot, as they are easy to carry and I thought SLRs would be tough to use. I had multiple choices at hand Sony T200, Canon 850, Canon Powershot S3 or Canon G9. Well I read a lot of reviews, went and checked out all these cameras at B&H; Photo Video and finally i decided to buy G9. It was a little pricy when compared to all the other choices I had, but it offered tons of other features which none of them had.Usage - I have been using G9 for over 3 months now and believe me its worth every bit of money and more. First of all the colors that I get from Canon G9, i could not get such beautiful colors from my Sony Camera. The features provided by G9 gave a lot of control and creativity to my pictures. I always shoot my pictures in the Manual Mode now, and G9 makes it so easy to use. The wheel at the back controls a lot of features but mostly i use it for shutter speed and aperture. You can also control the ISO separately and it goes up to 3200. When you play around with these shutter speed, aperture and ISO you get to know that there is so much more to photography. You can freeze motion by using high shutter speed and bigger aperture or you can imply motion by using a shutter speed as low as 15 sec. There is a whole set of pre-adjusted modes available, but when you start using the manual mode and read a little bit about photography you will prefer the Manual Mode.Apart from shutter speed, aperture and ISO you can also use presets for White Balance, flash (both strength and timing) and manual focus. The 6X optical zoom is better than most of the cameras in its class except Canon Powershot S3. Some say that 12.1 mega pixel is an overkill, but never the less its very useful when you want to take pictures and edit them on your computer, most helpful when you want that wide angle look from your photo.Size - Canon G9 is a bit on the bulky side, its not one of those cameras which you can slip it in your jeans pocket. But i guess you can pack all the power in a smaller camera. It feels a little heavy, but then again you will get used to it and when you see your pictures on that 3 inch wide screen, you wont regret the size. The screen is very bright and beautiful.Pictures - I think i have used G9 for all sorts of pictures - I have taken Portraits, Landscapes, Kids, Slow Shutter speed, Fast Shutter Speed, Indoors, Outdoors and they all come out great. I don't use the presets much, but once i used the Snow preset and it did the job perfectly well for me. I have used the RAW pictures a few times and its really useful feature to have, if you would like to edit the pictures without loosing quality. I have also taken a lot of Movie shots and they also come out reasonably good, I don't expect much from it as its primarily for photography. One good thing is that you can zoom in and out while taking the video, which was absent in my Sony. Finally speaking you will be amazed to the pictures you take...when they start to look pretty professional.Other useful features include Color Ascent mode, where only one color gets highlighted in your picture and rest of the picture is B/W. You can use this to play around with your pictures and it gives excellent results.Battery Life - Well Battery lasts for only one day out i.e. around 200 photographs without flash. It also depends on the time you spent in viewing your pictures on the wide screen. But I would have loved it, if it lasted more. I guess you need to keep an extra battery with you.Memory - Only a meager 32 mb card comes with the camera. You definitely need a bigger card. Buy a 2GB or 4GB one, so that you can make full use of the 12.1 mega pixels.Recommendation - Well i think this is the best Point and Shoot camera available. It has acted as an inspiration to me and I have learnt a lot about photography after buying and using this camera. I just love the hobby now and probably in few months I would shift to SLRs as now I feel comfortable in using them.

Once the warranty expires there is a $120 fee for this.2. using the larger file sizes, the G9 is SLOW. Most of the time I use a smaller file size setting to speed things up, which pretty much negates it's supposed hi-res capabilities, and makes it no more useful than my wife's SD750 elph, which takes similar quality pictures, much faster at these file sizes and at half the price (not to mention lighter, and more compact).And like all cameras at this size, the optics are quite mediocre, so I find it to be only marginally better than many other smaller, lighter, and cheaper point and shoots. It seems to me that the G9 is a more a marketing niche for people who feel the need to hold something in their hands that's more rugged, heavier, and with a \"retro\" appearance so that they can still perceive themselves as \"serious\" photographers while using a point and shoot.", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "The 21st century Leica, kind of...", "Author": "The Pod Guy", "ReviewID": "R10YA7UYVO6XT3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read tons of reviews, and checked out all the online forums, so I thought I knew what to expect.

Now I know what everyone is talking about. It's substantial. Canon PowerShot G9 12.1MP Digital Camera with 6x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomYes, you can read zillions of reviews about the technical abilities of this little camera, how it's no DSLR, how noise can become a problem, how everyone wishes it were faster, smaller, with a wider zoom lens, etc. But once you get it in your hands, and start taking pictures with it, you realize how the balance of size, picture quality (with image stabilization and RAW shooting too), and ease of use, all come together to help you capture great shots in a spontaneous way that your DSLR may have discouraged. If you own a digital SLR, you know how that big body and lens, with subsequent \"support system\" of bags and gear tends to hamper spontaneous activity. With the G9, just go to the park, take a walk, play with the kids or the family dog with the G9 in tow and you realize how handy it really is. Hint: a wrist strap is useful on this camera.However, this is no ordinary point and shoot camera. When you want to get creative, go nuts with full manual control of everything. Great retro-style display of aperture with linked shutter speed via thumb wheel, really handy. Even focus via the thumb wheel (I like the smooth focus capability a lot for composed shots). Very nice. Want filters? Get a Lensmate or Canon adapter and throw some 58mm filters on it. I like polarizers outdoors, they make my pictures pop. Doing some simple studio work? Throw some cheap radio triggers on the built-in hot shoe and use those budget flashes off-camera, or maybe cheap fluorescent lights. Keep the ISO low for those magazine spreads and noise is no problem. Process through Aperture, or Lightroom (or the included Canon RAW processing software), manage noise with Noise Ninja, etc., you'll get some fantastic images. Use what ever you feel comfortable with, the camera will deliver. There's enough dynamic range there.No, it's no match for the sheer picture quality of your (probably expensive) DSLR with the big lenses and the big sensor, but really people, it's less than $450. And it's portable. So with a little finessing, and a little understanding of how light, aperture, shutter speed and image quality affect your shots, you'll really enjoy this camera. It is reminiscent of those wonderful old, high quality compact 35mm film cameras long since gone, where the key philosophy here is to keep it simple, carry it with you, concentrate on the composition and don't look too obvious while doing it. Only the G9 is thoroughly modern with face detection, auto bracketing, spot metering, scene modes and custom setups too.I've even ordered an oversized, vintage 35mm viewfinder to sit in the flash shoe (the bulit-in viewfinder is a bit too small and murky for me) so I can keep my eyes open with the camera up to my face while shooting, and in the process perhaps see things differently than by using the (huge!) LCD display held out at arms length. Set the camera at the right zoom and snap away (yes, the shutter noise is a digital recreation too, there's no real shutter noise or mirror flip, and it can be turned off for stealth).So there you have it. Quick, easy, high quality pics, lots of pixels, RAW processing (a MUST for real digital photography, so get a big memory card) and full manual control in a solid, easy to hold, small brick of a viewfinder camera (with a giant 3\" LCD). Oh, sure it does video and records audio too, blah blah blah, but it's the images that shine here. If you want, you can control it via USB through your PC or Mac too. There's nothing really like it.  Buy it through Amazon (an authorized Canon dealer) and get peace of mind, US warranty, great return policy, super fast shipping.

Let me explain: I am 80 years old, started out with a Speed Graphic using the Ansel Adams Zone System, graduated to a Linhof Technica V with all the extras, downsized to an Olympus OM-1, then a Canon EOS 35mm with most of the extras, got older and grew tired of toting all that gear and, in 2000, gave it all up for snapshots with a Canon Digital Power Shot 100. Shot lots of 2.1 MP stuff and quickly lost all interest in photography. But the spark was still smouldering so this year (2008)I bought a Canon G9 and started shooting again.  Wow! It's like my Linhof days with 2 pounds of equipment (including the tripod) instead of fifty pounds.  There's an abundance of technical reviews on the G9 so I'll skip that and move on to the REAL reason I give it 5 stars: When I put this little digital tank on a tripod and set it on M (manual) it reminds me of my 4x5 days, under a focus cloth composing on a 4x5 screen or peeking though a mirror back and checking parallex, depth of field, and composition. When I scroll through the aperture and exposure settings it reminds me of my spot meter days of evaluation except, with this little jewel, you see the final result BEFORE you press the shutter.  What I missed most was the way 4x5 slowed you down and made you study your subject. You weren't after 10 shots bracketed, you were after 1 shot carefully composed and technically structured. There was something special about getting to know your environment while you took the time to compoose and evaluate or wait for the right sky conditions. 35mm didn't satisfy, it simply motivated me to become a quick shot bracketed shooter. And, like 4x5, it hid its final result until after the darkroom.  So - if you REALLY want to experience the shot and put it in your memory bank, get this camera, put it on a tripod, and ENJOY photography. And, when circumstances dictate, just whip it  out, point and shoot on auto, and get the shot. Either way, this camera excels.

We are both members of the local camera club.  Amazon came through with their as-promised delivery time, as usual.  I'll admit that I am totally spoiled by Canon's 5D, and, as such, my G9 expectations were probably bound to remain unrealized. Nonetheless, there are many \"good\" G9 reviews.  The first thing that I noticed was that there is noise that simply cannot be ignored: shoot at ISO 200 and there it is.So, what I take for granted: using most any ISO that I want to capture a low noise image, just cannot be taken for granted with the G9.  To be fair, just about ALL compacts suffer from this shortcoming, more or less. For the price I expected \"a cut above\" in performance. My friend noticed the same thing.  Even though Canon software has adaptive noise reduction to minimize this annoyance, it's \"just one more thing to worry about,\" and, in fact, was the deal-breaker for my friend who reluctantly took advantage of Amazon's outstanding returns policy.  My G9 had one more surprise in store for me: it almost unerringly \"back-focused\" so that the subject in the \"focus square\" on the LCD came out \"soft\" while the background immediately behind the subject was in sharper (but not tack-sharp) focus. My friend's G9 produced sharper pictures than mine did with no back-focusing problem.  My wife owns a Canon Elph ( SD700 IS ) camera that she keeps in her pocket. It takes great pictures for what it is, and she loves it. My Canon 5D DSLR is simply great, and I have won many blue ribbons in juried competitions with it.  I had hoped (perhaps unrealistically) to get another Canon with at least some of the ease of picture-taking that the 5D offers. Although a properly working G9 is probably somewhat superior to the usual compact cameras offered today, if you are seeking a \"photographic tool\" that won't get in the way of deliberate artistic picture taking, try out the G9, but don't throw away the packaging material that you may need for a return.  If you are seeking a grab-and-go compact camera that has a LOT of DSLR-type features in a slick \"retro\" package, you could do a lot worse than the G9.  I also own an old clunky 7MP Canon G6 which still takes OK pictures.  I'll use it until something better than the \"OK\" G9 comes out.  For ME, the G9 is just too much of a compromise for $440,although, if it was a GREAT compact, I'd be willing to pay more.  As you can see, it all depends on what YOUR requirements and expectations are. I feel almost guilty giving the G9 3 stars since I really like the other fine Canon cameras that I own.

I'm your average point-and-shoot-er... I'm not well versed in ISO, focal length, color depth, noise & color aberrations. I tend to point, shoot, and hope it comes out well.That said, I've done a bit of reading over the last month after buying a Sony H3 and being moderately unsatisfied with its point & shoot results (noise & color aberrations).However, having read so many reviews, I got a bit more info on things like ISO settings on digital cameras and links with noise, and color issues. So, I think that some of my prior issues with the H3 may have been \"user-malfunction\"-related. IE, \"know thy camera, and they camera will love you.\"Prior to the H3 I owned a Canon A70 (3MP), which I'd say was an excellent point & shoot camera that rarely disappointed me.Anyway, partly due to my initial bad experiences with the Sony, partly due to its overly expensive memory cards, and partly because I really trust Canon (had prior bad experiences with a Sony P72, I think, as well?), I decided I wanted to upgrade to the 12MP + RAW of the Canon G9 (after reading lots of reviews of it versus some other models).The things I like about the Canon G9 were several:- Its portability (very similar to the Canon A70, and slightly better than Sony H3)- Its heft. Believe it or not, I *like* the weighty feel of it.- Its metal body. Again it feels sturdy (though I hope never to drop it and test just how sturdy it is).- I like the fact that under normal lighting conditions you can point & shoot, and it seems to take extremely crisp images with very little noise (from an amateur's perspective), and the noise that I can see only seem to be noticeable if you zoom all the way in to view the actual pixels and such up close.- I like the dial with direct access to ISO settings. Somehow that gives it a rather \"professional\" feel. Even if it's only a mental thing. It's still nice to have easy access to the setting rather than having to fiddle with menus, etc.- I like the fact that despite having a slightly more complex button layout than the H3 (something I wasn't looking forward to), once you figure out what the buttons do, it's rather intuitive and the multitude of buttons doesn't really detract (for me) from the usage experience.- I like the instant access to a white balance (I think?) adjustment button in the upper right of the back face, just above the back face jog dial you use to control it. That way you can instantly dial up or down the exposure a few levels. I find that could be handy for \"mood lighting,\" and have already used it a few times to set the lighting a bit lower in a scene like candle light, etc. (where the camera tends to want to expose a bit more, but it would detract from the candle light).- I like the fact that one can zoom in on images in playback mode to see if focus and such were correct, and if detail is sufficient, or if the shot needs to be taken again. I realize other cameras probably have this feature too. It's just nice.- For me, startup time seems very quick. Hit the button, lens extends, picture shows up on the LCD, ready to start snapping away (unless you need to change modes or flip to a slightly different exposure setting; but that's not the camera's fault! You should have been ready beforehand!).- Thus far I've not run down the first charge on the battery. Then again, I'm casual about images, turn the camera on for a few minutes, snap a few good photos, kill the bad ones, and turn it off. I've snapped a number of shots around the office to test it. I've snapped a few images around home in non-optimal light to figure out how to get the best quality image. I took pictures at our work Christmas party, and briefly took a couple pictures at my own family Christmas dinner. I've still got 2 out of 3 bars left on the battery.- I like the fact that it uses a standard USB A-MiniB cable, unlike the proprietary Sony AV cable that came with the H3.- Likewise, I like the fact that the Canon uses standard SD/SDCH cards that are cheaper than the Sony H3's Memory Stick Duo and Pro Duo cards.I'm finding it hard to say much negative about it thus far. I'm still learning how to take the most crisp images with the camera. But I've got a book now with tips and tricks. Will have to start using my tripod more, it looks like, for the old \"tack sharp\" photos. But, under normal light, it seems to take pretty excellent images, even just point and shoot.One complaint might be that the button in the upper left (the one that flashes when the camera wants to \"shift gears\" to a different ISO) is actually somewhat difficult to press / activate while holding down the shutter part way to maintain auto-focus. For me, I seem to have to either push it with a fingernail, or push REALLY hard with the edge of my thumb.Oh, yes, and the fact that several lights blink constantly while the machine is downloading images is rather distracting (and I wonder if it wastes the battery; though I suspect they run off USB power); likewise the \"fireworks\"-like animated graphic in the middle of the LCD that also continues to play while downloading. Minor complaint. But I'm sure I'll learn to ignore it. Would be nice to find a way to turn off the blinky lights though, as they're a mild nuisance.I'm pretty sure this will be my new \"work horse\" camera for the foreseeable future. I don't expect I'll have to upgrade any time soon (unless of course they come out with a camera that's a portable/pocketable, point & shoot, does full HD video, and lets you zoom while shooting video, and/or lets you use a wireless remote to take photos w/o camera shake). Unless such a lovely hybrid comes on the market any time soon w/o sacrificing any features (like RAW support), I don't foresee having to switch camera again.To those who complain about some subtle cool blue tint to the LCD, I don't see it. Perhaps I'm not a \"pro,\" so I don't notice these things. But, so what? Really... Is it designed to be a \"professional\" camera or a high end point & shoot? I think it's the latter, as intended.If someone wants to USE it for a professional camera, by all means, be my guest! But if one EXPECTS a high end point & shoot to *be* a low-end DSLR, perhaps they're setting their expectations too high in general. If you want DSLR quality, get a DSLR. If you want a PORTABLE point & shoot with near-DSLR (but still point & shoot) quality, the G9 is admirable. My opinion only, of course. As a casual user who is thrilled that a PORTABLE / POCKETABLE point & shoot camera can achieve such high quality output while maintaining relative simplicity, depth of features, PROFESSIONAL LOOK & FEEL, etc.Likewise, to a few people I've heard complaining that there's insufficient \"grip\" or that the zoom lever or button are too small: I've not had an issue with either. The zoom lever has been sufficient for me to use under a range of circumstances and camera angles. Likewise the grip isn't all that large, but it's large enough, and I've never had a slippage or inability to grip the camera. I generally hold with the index and middle finger up front on the grip and thumb in the space just left of the mute/microphone button. Seems to be ample space for me. ring and pinky fingers usually just rest at the bottom of or underneath the camera.The small viewfinder is a neutral issue for me. I don't use the viewfinder, frankly. It doesn't display the entire image to be taken, and the LCD allows for a much wider number of shots to be taken, where you can't always have your eye pressed right up to the camera. Likewise, I'd hate to smudge the LCD. I'd probably not care much if the viewfinder was removed completely. I doubt I'd miss it, honestly.----------Addendum (12-26-07): I've added several shots to the \"customer gallery.\" One is a night shot capturing a bare tree in the flash, with the moon back-lighting a portion of the branches. For being a newbie and using mostly automatic settings, I think it came out pretty well!The other images are a set of 3 images of a Christmas decoration, progressively cropping to finer and finer detail. I find it rather amazing how closely one can crop this image and still retain excellent picture quality (right down to not-too-bad reflections off a tiny ornament in a large scene and the fine gold inlaid detail printed at the top of a decorative glass). As of this writing they put it somewhere int he middle of the gallery.

They are just to heavy and easy to steal.  This little camera fits in my fanny pack and gives me about 70% of the control I have with the bigger cameras.The manual control is simply outstanding both in what you can do and how Canon implemented the menus.  I have a SD500 that I've used for years and it has little manual control. What the SD500 does have in manual control is all burried in layers of menus that make it slow and hard to get to.  The G9 is nearly as easy to use as my 5D and that is amazing for a little camera like this one.  Having the ability to shoot RAW is the final icing on the cake.  Don't let earlier reviews worry you about RAW, Adobe photoshop and Lightroom support it fully.The build quality is amazing, it feels like a tank and I expect it to stand up to my needs very well.  I will also be using the underwater case and that is a great additional feature that further inhances its value to me.On the down side, the f/stop is a little limited. It stops at f/8 which is a little less than I would like but it is mostly fine. It is very noisy at ISO 400 or larger which makes me wish the camera manufactures would stop playing the megapixel game and focus more on image quality.  I would take a 8mp  camera that looks great at ISO400 over a 12mp that doesn't any day.In the end it is a camera that I will have with me a lot and it will take great photos in most of the situations I need to to.

Far too many people think that they are going to get DSLR performance from what is essentially a point and shoot camera.Sorry, but there is no free lunch. You can build a camera to high standards. You can have it save in RAW. You can do all sorts of things to improve it. The bottom line is that the G9 is a small-sensor camera and suffers the same fate as every other camera with a small sensor.Given current technology, nobody can make a small sensor perform like a larger one. Going much beyond native ISO is going to substantially lower image quality by introducing digital \"noise\". That's just the way that it is and neither Canon nor anyone else has solved the problem. In fact, it may not even have a solution.That said, the G9 may just be the best small-sensor, high-end p&s; on the market. Granted, it doesn't have much competition, but Canon has itself a winner. You'll hear gripes from older G series owners about the G9 having a slower lens and a non-articulated LCD. I'd prefer a faster lens too, but it is what it is so make the best of it.Image quality, within its limits, is excellent. At 12.1mp, the resolution of this sensor can allow for prints larger than many of us will ever make on a regular basis. The catch is to not shoot at an ISO over 100 and ISO 80 would be even better.That's the price that we must pay for having 12.1mp on a small sensor. Small price, as far as I'm concerned. The G9 is not meant to replace your DSLR. If that's what you think this camera will do you are wrong. What it will do is allow you to capture high quality images, in good light, with a camera that will fit into a large pocket.Having shot with numerous cameras over the past 40 years, I'd like to see Canon make a few improvements. For one thing, the \"grip\" (or what there is of it) stinks. Sorry, I don't know of any other word that accurately describes it. Having to pay $25 for a third-party grip annoys me since the much less expensive A series cameras feel much more secure in my hands.My pet peeve, and it's not only with Canon, is small sensors with too many pixels. Up to a point, I have to agree that more pixels are better than less pixels. That point is reached when a manufacturer (and they all do it) crams so many pixels on the sensor that image quality is compromised by the time you reach ISO 200. I think that most people who want a camera like the G9 would be happier with 1/3 fewer pixels and improved medium ISO performance.Well, nothing is perfect but the G9 is pretty darned good.

I can now leave the DSLR home with no regrets that I'm giving anything up.Like all compact digital cameras, at higher ISOs it doesn't match DSLR performance, you need to use this camera at low ISOs.The \"image stabilization\" really works. I have been able to get sharp photos at full telephoto at 1/8 sec while handholding the camera. (Of course you must concentrate carefully for that to work.)This camera is bigger and chunkier than the typical compact camera. This is because it has a larger sensor (1/1.7\" while most compact cameras have smaller 1/2.33\" or 1/2.5\" sensors) and a 6X lens. It's worth the extra size and weight if you are serious about image quality.

Then came a digital era, and I purchased several generations of Minolta DiMAGE pocket cameras. For my downhill skiing trips I wanted a rugged, dependable miniature and intelligent cameras with viewfinder, minimum of controls and ability to shoot movie clips. Back then DiMAGE cameras met my all expectations. I used them at home, daily at work and during vacations. Unfortunately Minolta folded before producing a compact camera with image stabilization. IS is very important for low light shooting from hands. During my September trip to the picturesque Greek Santorini island my DiMAGE X50 had to struggle on it's own with both strong and low lighting of day and night. There thoughts of a better camera with manual controls came to my mind, views were so precious! I carefully studied reviews of DSLRs, looked at them - O boy, they are bulky, and they do not shoot movies! Super-zooms with fixed lenses were not smaller either. Thoughts of falling again during skiing on such camera didn't make me happy - I had few of them. Suddenly I stumbled upon Canon G9 review - it was what I wanted: relatively compact, flat, almost no protruding parts, small Lithium battery, compact but effective optical image stabilization, F2.8 35 mm 6x zoom lens , amazing 3\" LCD + viewfinder, ergonomic manual controls, black, takes movies and have newest 12 MP image sensor. I immediately ordered it on Amazon because of better price and assortment of options available; I wanted a decent camera case with it as well. UPS ground parcel came shortly; camera was safely packed and started to work right away. I used camera only for a month so far at home and outside. Quality of the pictures with stunning details exceeded my expectations. Skin tones in portrait shooting came out so good! DiGIC III processor was able to adjust even to strong back light conditions. During night shooting I saw IS kicked in: pictures came out sharp and colorful. I took Halloween pictures in a dimmed light using built in camera flash and got praises from my friends on the web photo album; velvety fabrics came out beautifully. I shot several short movies at standard resolution at 30 fps - they came out crisp and well balanced with good sound from the built-in microphone. I'm wondering: does G9 sensor provides pixel binning for a movie resolution, or is a better sensor? My Minoltas with rise of sensor pixel count would capture exceedingly darker and blockier movies. G9's black paint makes it to look larger and heavier, but it feels just right in hands and don't strain my shoulder on a strap. Lens on power up/down telescopes in and out fast, and hides behind the lens protector - no lens cap needed. Shooting lags for portraits was imperceivable. LCD image is so good, even with sun beaming behind - I didn't glance into viewfinder yet. Shutter release is a feather like comparing to Minolta's; at first I was struggling to find \"half way\" for the focus check. So far, I charged battery only twice during a month.

Background info:  I am not a Canon user (but I have nothing against Canon products), I've shot with film for many years (Contax), and digitally for the past 4+ years (Sony 828, Sony V3, Sony R1).2.  I was very interested in the G9 when it was recently announced because of the great reputation of the Canon G series and most importantly--> the return of the RAW format in the G9.  Furthermore, everything on paper completely outshined my ancient Sony V3; a very good camera but very very slow... and with limited zoom range etc...3.  Thus it was very dissapointing when I had to return the Canon G9 after several days of testing.  Here were my impressions of the camera.  a.  Build Quality: Good  b.  Size:  Good; actually smaller than my V3.  c.  Performance:  excellent--> RAW write times were impressively fast (for a point and shoot).  d.  LCD:  completely terrible.  This is supposed to be the state of the art LCD (3 inch), but there was an overt cool /bluish color cast.  I tried every suggested variable (via Canon Tech and various on the forums), I went to a local camera store to try another G9 (same problem), and my observations were also confirmed via numerous folks on the web.  Some suggested that I just ignore the color cast and just use the LCD for framing and for checking basic exposure--initially a resonable argument but then when you logically think about it--> why should anyone put up with an overt color cast (and also an overly contrasty) image on the LCD, in a supposed top of the line point and shoot camera, from an industry leader like Canon?  It just doesn't make sense.  I mean, a $200.00 cheap 5 MP camera has better color rendition on the LCD than this G9.  e.  Even with the above LCD issues, I was still going to keep it if it weren't for the only \"ok\" image results.  I did some basic testing comparing the G9 vs Sony V3 (real old camera)--> all shot in RAW, all shot via Tripod, all shot using calibrated gray card etc...  Bottomline, the G9 images were good and I'm sure that people will be able to get nice shots from this camera--> but when / if you actually compare it to something like the Sony V3 (which again is an old camera)--> the Sony consistently just produces more sharper images.4.  Thus each person will have to decide what's important to them in regards to their photographic needs / wants / goals etc...  For me, it's always image quality and thus I had to return the G9.

The image quality, at max res and minimal JPEG compression is similar to what I remember my ancient, first generation digital SLR was--a nice overall Histogram reading, terrific auto white balancing, and decent contrast control using the aperture and shutter settings.This is a camera for someone who has at least a year's worth of good experience with a previous \"prosumer\" camera.  It is not for little Johnny and his summer camp adventures--but I think given the price, you know that already.  While you can certainly give it to a child, there are so many higher function settings and dials that a novice will easily get confused.  This is the kind of camera best suited for outdoor shots and well lighted indoor shots; lousy for professional users who may complain about \"noise\" with low light levels, or the difficulty of getting RAW file format shots unless you use Canon's cheesy downloading software (the Photoshop plug-ins are out there for reading RAW format files, but it seems Canon has written them for Adobe Photoshop CS3, and I still use CS2).  I managed to get spectacular night shots with very little JPEG compression noise by opening the aperture and using a tripod.  Honestly, that's a big deal over my previous Canon A710.Now for the bad part.How difficult would it be for Canon corporate to hire a few more \"non-English as a second language\" tech writers to write their manuals in a grammatically correct, spell-checked manner?

The real trick was to find a camera that was small enough and automatic enough for my wife (basic level camera user) to use without my assistance, and flexible enough to provide me with advanced functionality.  The G9 filled our wish list and much more.  The videos are high quality and a real nice bonus when you don't have a video camera with you.I bought the 430 EX flash to go with this, which makes a huge difference even in every day shots (kids birthday parties for example). We got the Canon 2X teleconverter which also made a huge difference on a recent trip to Costa Rica.  Thw wildlife shots are great, and we got some incredible, vivid, up close shots of birds, crocodiles, and monkeys. We also purchased the teleconverter and a polarized filter, which really enhanced the many beach and boating shots we took.Although the battery lasts for about 300 shots (all in 12 MP), I grabbed another one for the trip, just in case.  The battery charger that ships with the camera is wonderful -- it's small enough to fit in the camera bag, and in a pinch you can charge the battery for 15 minutes and get about 20-30 more shots out of it.I do recommend a 4 GB memory card.  I purchased an 8 GB card: 500 full resolution photos, and about 20 four minute videos still left me with room for 700 more photos.  I suppose it will come in handy for a two-week trip. I even made use of the audio recording feature, which allowed me to capture some reggae music additional to some still shots I took.The bundled software is really nice for viewing and tagging photos and videos, though I use Corel Photo Album for all printing, and Photoshop Elements for any editing. Someday I'll find one package that will do it all well, but not yet.Camera, teleconverter lens, flash, conversion lens, spare battery, filter, charger, and a few other items, all fit comfortably in a LowePro Nova Mini AW bag.  It's very durable and has a water proof cover.In all, I'm thrilled with this and amazed by how much functionality Canon put into this camera.  My wife is very happy with the great shots taken in Automatic mode too.", "Date": "February 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Grey-market Canon G9 - WorldWide Distributers", "Author": "Igotstuck", "ReviewID": "R3CJKT31NYM8DZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Canon PowerShot G9 12.1MP Digital Camera with 6x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomThe Canon G9 is a great little camera.

Kurtz \"Working Photojournalist\"", "ReviewID": "R2YTGV25WTFJUC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay, that's a little hyperbole, but just a little.The Canon PowerShot G9 12.1MP Digital Camera with 6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom is hands down the best \"point and shoot\" digital camera I've ever used, and I've used a lot of them (including the Canon G1, G2, G5, Olympus 7070 and Canon G7). The image quality of the G9 is among the best of its breed, which says a lot about the quality of the Canon lens and sensor it's built around. For a point and shoot, it's very fast. The shutter lag (time between you press the button and it actually makes a picture) is greatly reduced compared to its predecessors and it writes to the card practically as fast as you shoot, about 2 frames per second when shooting JPEGs, about .7-1 fps on raw. Speaking of raw, this is one of the few digital point and shoots that still has raw capture. This is a great feature for serious photographers.The full selection of manual controls means this a camera you can buy and grow with, from letting the camera do everything to making all the decisions yourself. In my case, I use it as a backup to my digital SLR bodies (Canon 5D) for my documentary and reportage work.The same caveats that apply to most other point and shoot cameras apply to the G9. Noise at high ISO (400 and above) is pretty obvious and takes away from image quality, and although it's fast (for a P&S;), it's still not a sports camera. Shutter lag may prevent you getting a lot of those peak action photos. But these are issues shared by most point and shoot digital cameras.My only complaints that are G9 specific is that I find the buttons on the back a little small and a little too easily accessed. So I sometimes turn the flash on accidentally or change the motor drive from continuous to single frame.This camera is best suited for travel and street photography in nice light. It's a formidable photographic tool.", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great compromise between SLR and point-and-shoot", "Author": "Ian McAllister", "ReviewID": "R36YFQMU2VJ9AW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want a camera with many of the features of an SLR but in a more compact form-factor then the Canon PowerShot G9 would make a great choice. That's what I was looking for and I'm pleased with my purchase of a G9.I've been using a Canon EOS-10D for about 4 years with great results, even though I'm essentially a novice photographer. I find that a great quality camera coupled with an external flash allows me to take very nice pictures. While I love the 10D, I decided that I'd like to get a more compact camera that I could take with me all the time (vs. the 10D which I share with my wife). We also have a Canon PowerShot S500 but I find that the S500 has way too much shutter lag to photograph kids and dogs and lacks features like RAW and a hot-shoe so I decided to purchase a new camera.Ultimately I chose the G9 because of the following features:* RAW support* Manual ISO selection option* Image stabilization* Histogram* 12 mega-pixels* Large 3.5\" LCD screen* Flash hot-shoe* Manual shooting modes* Video shooting modesI've been using it for several weeks and have been very pleased with the results. The ability to add Canon Speedlite to the camera is one of the best features as bouncing a speedlite on indoor shots was the single biggest improvement I've made to my photography ever. I'm learning how to read a histogram and the G9 is proving to be a great tool as I learn more about photography.Here are the only drawbacks I've found:* There is noticeable shuutter-lag. The G9 is much better than my Powershot S500, but there is noticeable lag when compared to my 10D and other Canon SLR's.* The ergonomics aren't great. The camera would benefit from a slightly larger grip but there are aftermarket grips available to fix this.* The balance is pretty poor when used with an external flash. This isn't really a knock since the camera is supposed to be small and any small camera will be top-heavy with a flash mounted.* The onboard flash does a pretty poor job on indoor shots, lighting up the subjects way too much - predictable for any onboard flash.* The tripod mount is centered on the camera rather than aligned with the lens. This hasn't proved to be a big drawback yet but looking ahead to more tripod use I wish they would have aligned the mount with the lens.All in all, a great camera.", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "the great compact substitute for DSLR", "Author": "Hyun S.

The model is quickly becoming obsolete.  The next generation of prosumer cameras has already entered the the market (Canon G10, Panasonic LX3, Nikon P6000, etc).  So unless you get a really good deal, there are few compelling reasons to buy G9 any more.  One caveat, however: if portrait taking is of importance to you, this is the area where G9 still delivers the goods (more on it later).Other people have already discussed nearly every aspect of the camera in great detail.  So I just have a couple of additional comments and observations to share with those who are still considering G9.  Hope that some folks will find these useful.1.  A number of Canon G9 users have complained of dust getting into the lens barrel.  Apparently this stuff coats the inside of the lens elements and essentially turns the camera into a useless piece of junk.  It is a known manufacturing defect, wherein dust is trapped within the bodies of some cameras during the production.  Canon will clean it out for free during the warranty period.  Obviously, not every camera has been affected, and the lens on my camera has stayed crystal clear.  But if you are considering buying G9 on E-bay, it helps to be aware of the issue.2.  At the full extended zoom (6x), Canon G9 blurs the background and takes studio-quality portraits.  This is where G9 really shines.  There is a beautiful 3-dimensional aspect to the faces, just like what you see on professional photos.  In my opinion, this is by far the best feature of this camera.  I previously owned Sony V1, which had a large sensor coupled with a high quality Zeiss lens.  It produced excellent photos, but it could never match the portraits that come out of G9.Incidentally, judging from the CameraLab review of G10 (Canon's next generation upgrade to G9), the G10's shorter telephoto lens (5x) loses the capability of shallowing the depth of field, and as a result produces only average portraits.  So in my unprofessional opinion, G9 will beat G10 in portrait quality on any given day.3.  I love the photostitch mode.  It creates some amazing panoramic pictures; you gotta see them to believe.4.  Low light performance is OK, but not quite as good as some other point and shoot cameras.  Pictures with ISO above 400 are only marginally useful.5.  The dynamic range of the photos is frankly mediocre.  Hopefully, Canon G10 will perform better in this area, thanks to its new intelligent contrast feature.  I-contrast is a new image processing algorithm designed to brighten up dark areas on the picture.  Nikon P6000 has a similar function called D-lighting.  It is my understanding that you can improve dynamic range of your photos by fiddling with RAW images on the computer, but I have not been so successful using Canon supplied software.  I do not own Adobe, which could be my problem to begin with.6.  The G9 lens is not quite as sharp as I expected coming from Canon.  I am not talking about the soft-looking image tones, which are a hallmark of all Canon cameras (as opposed to Sony or Panasonic).  What I am trying to say is that the detail-resolving power of Canon lens on G9, while by no means poor, does not quite match what you get from Zeiss or Leica.  Apparently, Canon has been painfully aware of the fact.  As a result, Powershot G10 is reported to have been given a much sharper lens with greater detail resolving power.7.  No matter what settings I use (including custom white balance, different saturation and sharpness levels), my camera is uncapable of correctly rendering purple color.  The color looks violet on final images, which is close enough but no cigar.  In comparison, Sony V1 renders the same color accurately in auto mode.8.  Finally, the camera has a neck strap, but no wrist strap.  Most of you don't care, but those who prefer a wrist strap will have to search for an aftermarket option.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "The person who gave it a 2 is wrong", "Author": "M.

I am very impressed with its sturdy and compact built and it has not failed me in taking wonderful pictures in my travels both here in the US and abroad hence I decided to buy another one.  The choice to buy the Canon G9 was initially driven by the need for a higher megapixel camera and I truly believe you simply can not go wrong with the CANON brand especially with the compact point and shoot type.  The reviews from early buyers also influenced my decision.The body frame of the camera ( metal alloy ) is bar none the best in its class, the look and feel is expensive and classy, very comfortable to handle and operate, long battery life and the pictures are awesome! The  large active LCD matrix does not strain the eyes of the viewer. The accesories (teleconverter, macro, wide angle lenses) are really not that essential for this very versatile camera.My few complaints: the zooming in and out function is surprisingly slower than my digital elph which is a disappointment. The LCD viewer is raised from the main surface of the camera back hence can be potentially scratched although this can be alleviated  with a peel off screen protector which is a challenge to apply completely free of trapped bubbles. For future models, a recessed screen, like the digital elph's is much more protected and lasting.Overall, still highly recommended for quality, durability,and  dependability if needing a higher end but still compact point and shoot type digital cam.", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Problems with dust", "Author": "Gregoire Dubois", "ReviewID": "R3ULOF66LZTWAN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am a canon fan and had only very positive experiences so far with canon cameras and lenses.

Not sure yet if I was unlucky in getting a poorly build examplar of the G9 or if the tropicalisation is badly conceived, but dust entered far too easily in the lens which can be unmounted only in a specialized canon center (still haven't received it back after 3 weeks now).Should you consider using it for outdoor activities where dust can be a issue, you may reconsider using/buying the G9.

I have found that I use a camera alot more if it is easy to carry around, and the G9 fits that bill very well. It's not like my little Elph, which almost goes unnoticed in a shirt pocket; but it will fit into a jacket pocket quite easily and takes vastly superior pictures to the Elph.Do not be under the impression that the G9 will shoot the \"same as\" a DSLR, however, because it won't. But in most circumstances (other than low light, as others have mentioned) the large majority of people will be fairly awed by the pictures this beautiful little camera can take. It IS that good. Start to get over 400 ISO, however, and, well, then it gets a little grainy and noisy.The camera can be set on full auto and take \"very good\" pictures, but I would not waste my money on the G9 if that is all you are going to do with it. This camera is definitely for the more creative types. I think it works best in aperture priority or shutter priority modes, although there are so many different settings on this camera it can take days to wade through the instruction manual to cover them all. I've had mine for about a month and I'm still not through it yet, it's been easy to \"use\" but difficult to \"master\", but I happen to think that's a good thing.I would highly recommend the Lensmate brand adapter for the G9. It solves two problems inherent in the G9's design - first, it protects the zoom lens when it is extended, second, it makes the camera much easier to hold and manipulate. It is also made out of aluminum and is of much higher quality than the cheap Canon plastic adapter. Also, the Lensmate adapter is threaded so you can use filters, which I do, a UV and a polarized, when required. I keep my Lensmate adapter on all the time, even though it adds slightly to the G9's bulk.Also, do yourself a favor and spend the $6 on an G9 LCD screen protector. Peel it off and stick it on, poof, no worries about scratching the beautiful and bright screen (and it is really beautiful at 3\"). 'Nuff said.A few other options for the G9 I found extremely worthwhile: the high quality metal grip and thumb rest by Richard Franiec. Again, they make the G9 so much easier to handle and shoot. I also bought the G9 leather case (these are only sold by Canon in Japan for some reason, but you can find them on ebay). I especially like how \"60's retro\" the already retro G9 looks with this case. It is a two piece design and with only the bottom part of the case attached (screws into the tripod mount), the camera is still functional and it does a good job of protecting most of the camera body.I also bought a Sandisk 4GB Extreme III HDSC card for the camera, with a card reader. It'll hold plenty of pix and vid for my needs. A 2GB card is probably sufficient, and if you tend to lose cards you might want to stick with that instead since it's cheaper than replacing a 4GB card. The card the camera comes with is so small it's really basically useless.Lastly, I considered getting some Raynox lenses for the G9, but decided against it as the effective lens on the G9 is already 35mm-210mm equivalent. Adding a supplemental/larger lens to the G9 (unless I was doing macro work or just had it set up on a tripod and didn't care) would just make the camera bulkier, meaning I would use it less. Again, the point of this camera is to take it with me wherever I go. So I'm happy with the camera set up the way it is.I have not had the chance to use the video on this camera yet, and I've heard people complain about the inability to use the digital zoom function with it... Oh well, that is not the primary reason I bought the camera and it is not that important to me.As far as the pictures I've taken so far, I'm extremely pleased with them. I took the G9 with me on vacation to a New England beach destination this summer right after I got it. Again, I was not expecting DSLR quality, jaw-dropping photos, but the G9 really delivered nonetheless. If you are a decent photographer, \"non-professionals\" will be very, very impressed with your pictures.I hope this review helps you decide if the G9 is the right camera for you, and if it is, what other options you might want to consider getting along with it.

Nichols", "ReviewID": "RXC2HWAE9W1U3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a smaller, more compact solution to my DSLR's when traveling out and about with our newborn child, a diaper bag camera so to speak.  I had bought the Canon S3 IS ealier and while it was a good camera it was still to big to fit in my pocket and had no ability for external flash if I wanted. I decided to go with the G9 and so far I'm pretty happy.  First the feel of the camera is very solid and well built and you defintely get the feeling that this is a nice camera. It is relatively small(campared to the canon S3-S5) and can squeeze into my pocket if it where the only thing in that pocket. Image quality is exceptional at 200 ISO and very managable at 400 ISO, anything above that you will need to have some decent noise reduction software to make the picture relatively usable, that goes for any Point & Shoot though and the G9 actually has better quality than the S3 at comparable ISO's.  The G9 has all the auto shooting settings you could want and the capablity for creative & manual controls.  The button layout I find very nice and I simply love that the ISO has it's own dial on top of the camera for quick changing when needed, no more fiddling in some menue to change the ISO, I wish my DSLR had that feature. The screen is very large and takes up most of the back of the camera and it is nice and vibrant, too bad it doesn't swivel out like the canon S series, though that would probaly make the camera bulkier. The shutter delay(time from when you push the shutter button to when the camera actually fires) is low and the camera is actually pretty fast with minimal lag especially if you have already focused on what you are shooting. As for focusing it seems to work well with very little search time to lock on to your suject. I really like how you can move the focus point anywhere you want on the screen allowing you a bit more compositonal control while maintaing what you want in focus, this was a pleasant surprise. The focal lenghts of the lens are nice from a wide end all the way to the telephoto end covering just about everything you need and the Image Stabilization feature really helps in low light to avoid from motion blur. The G9 also has a macro function that allows for a nice close shot if you are into flowers, insects or any other thing you may want to fill the frame with and I was very impressed with its performance. As for the onboard flash I must preface that I do not like onboard flash for any camera and I try to avoid having to use it unless I do not have a choice.  There is no exception to this flash as it seems harsh and causes red eye frequently even with the redeye reduction on. The nice thing about the G9 is that it has an onboard redeye reduction editing funtion where you review the photo and remove the redeye there on the spot instead of at home on the computer or at your photo printing kiosk, that option is pretty cool I must say.  The savior for the onboard flash is an external flash and the G9 has a hotshoe mount so you can attach a canon speedlite. This allows you to diffuse or bounce the flash making for a much nicer picture in my opinion and is one of the main reasons why I got rid of the canon S3 and bought the G9. Though I find it a bit silly you have a camera for the fact of it being small and compact and then have to carry an additional flash, so I rarely do as I might as well take my DSLR. The G9 has a movie mode so you can record video and they are of decent quality and I am please with them.  You have to switch the dial to movie mode on top of the camera which is no big deal though on the S3 & S5 there was a quick movie button that I wish this had so you could just start filming with the push of a button regardless of what shooting mode you were in at the time. Battery life is about 200 or so shots, give or take, which I find pretty low, so you will need an additional battery. I could go on about more features and the such but I think I covered the pros and cons that realy caugh my attention.Pros:Somewhat CompactBuild QualityImage quality- up to 400 ISOLarge LCD viewerISO DialButton LayoutLots of shooting options especially creative and manual conrolsMacro capablitiesHotshoe Mount for external flashAbility to move focus point anywhere on the LCD screenRedeye reduction with in camrea editingMovie capabiltitiesConsImage quality -800 and aboveOnboard flashBattery lifePriceSo to close I would recommend this if you are looking for a Point & Shoot as it has almost all the bells and whistles you could desire in a camera and it performs well.", "Date": "February 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice But Could Be Better For The Money", "Author": "C.

It is very nimble and light compared to my old Sony DSC-75.  But it's also built well.  I have had no problems with the memory card or battery life (I bought a 2 gb high speed card).  Some of the menus and controls require someone to use the camera fairly often to remember what they are doing.I am irked about the noise at higher ISOs.  It is hard to take good pictures in medium and low light situations (as in a house).  The flash is not that strong compared to my old Sony.  This camera seems to require a lot of post-shot editing, but that may be because I am not an expert at taking photographs and controlling variables.Pluses:*Built well*Lighter than an SLR*Able to add a few lenses for tele and wide shots*Good amount of megapixels*Pretty good design for so many features*Good battery life*Cheap(er) memory cards than Sony*Zoom is pretty decent for a point-and-shoot*Offers many controls and features for those up on photographyNegatives:*Noisy images, especially when shooting in lower-light situations (indoors and such).*A bit of post-shot production is required*When zooming during a movie, an audible click is heard on the audio from the switch being located right by the mic*PriceI am not convinced this camera is worth the $500 I paid for it.  It is a very nice camera, don't get me wrong.  I was in the market looking for a portable camera with high megapixels, a good zoom, and movie-taking abilities.  This one fit the bill, plus I wanted to learn about photography.  I must admit I am not a photo-taking guru, but this seems like a camera where everything needs to be just right to get a good picture right on the card instead of having to edit every little detail in a software program.If you don't feel like messing with the intricacies of adjusting settings and post-shot editing, do NOT purchase this camera.  I do intend on returning this camera to try out the Sony H3.  It has a better zoom, good amount of megapixels, more user-friendly, and $200 cheaper.  It does not zoom during movies, has quite a bit less control in settings, and the memory costs more.

I charged the battery to no avail and have checked online for suggestions. I have now found MANY posts that the Canon G9 is notorious for failing around 12-16 months, often when the camera powers up and extends its lens. In short, what happens is the PCB DC/DC board in the camera may short out by a loose screw -OR- the tiny fuse may blow. Either issue will cost approximately $180 for Canon repairs when past warranty. For those strong DIYers, here is a post that explains to tighten the screw before it's too late and also how to rplaice the fuse: [...] Other searches have revealed several companies that are familiar with this problem and advertise a repair for about half of Canon's going rate.  My G9 has less than 350 shutter actuations. I bought it as a backup/spare and it has spent the past six months swaddled in spare lens wraps and sitting cradled in the center of my camera case. As a professional photographer, the utmost care is taken with my equipment and this camera was never damaged or dropped by myself. It was purchased new from a Circuit City store that was closing when the economy crashed and this model was not a demo. Sadly, Canon is playing deaf, blind, and dumb.

During that time, I have done some random photography, and traveled to Barcelona, Granada, Mallorca, and St. Louis. I have taken water shots, night shots, and usual tourist shots. I have also traveled to 59 cities in 10 countries, and most (if not all) of my earlier photographs are day shots, as most point and shoot cameras offer limited controls.For my trips to wild life refuge, bird sanctuary etc I would carry my DSLR, but I hated to lug it around when I know that I am not headed to a safari. So, I was left with typical consumer cameras- I have tried Sony Cybershot DSC-T70, Samsung (camcorder with 5.2 mp still- NEVER buy it), Canon Powershot S5 IS, and Nikon Coolpix. Samsung- just stay away. Sony Cybershot had poor battery and limited control. Ditto for Nikon Coolpix. Though Nikon one is a much recent model, it still had all the point and shoot stuff, but that's about it. The Canon one was too bulky for a pocket camera.So, I wanted a camera that will have 5 to 6 optical zoom, as I don't need more than that in daily life. Unless you are doing wildlife photography, I don't see the point of higher optical zoom. I would have been happy with about 6 MP resolution- Canon G9 offered twice as that. I wanted a camera that uses SD card (in fact, that is another reason that I stay away from Sony cameras). I also wanted something that would allow me to set light, shutter, aperture, contrast- the whole range. AND YES! Canon G9 allows for all this, and more.There are a few night shots that I have taken with no flash. [IMHO, the flash, for most part, ruins night photography. You can even try taking a photo of a Christmas tree with flash and then compare without flash; and see the difference. The problem, however, is if you use the basic point and shoot cam then you can't control how much light camera should absorb, and the photos will come out too dark; and if you take it with flash, it normally comes out bland. So, THAT is a BIG plus for Canon G9. You get to set every bit of control.The other BIG plus [similar to why I still love the old roll cameras as well as DSLRs] is that I can blur the background  imagery esp. in nature photography. Yes! This one makes it possible, other point and shoot don't allow for this.It also has the regular features- records videos, color swap, color accent, photo stitch, time lapse movies, beach, indoor, snow, portrait, sports, under water, landscape, and the usual stuff.It is not as light as a basic point and shoot, but also not as big as the SLRs.What not to do? After getting this camera I also got the adapter and telephoto and wide angle lenses. Yes, you can attach those lenses on this one. But I returned them within a week. Why? Well, it defeats the purpose of carrying a small camera (compared to DSLRs). Also, unlike DSLRs, where the lense would retract into the body of the camera, with these ones, you are basically stuck with them! So, if you plan to buy camera lenses for this one, I'll say go for a small DSLR instead.I also bought two extra batteries- each could last for up to 5 hours, depending on the weather and use.I use 8GB SD card with it, and it never runs out. I carry an extra one though as sometimes when I take videos it does fill up.What could be better? Well, I wish it had a wider shot capacity. But I don't miss it particularly.The most imp point about photography- it is only 10% about the camera; the 90% is you! Many may disagree, but I also don't believe that one has to join any professional or even hobby class to learn photography. I haven't, and my friends think that I am doing alright! Good luck!

The automatic modes (Auto and P) take such wonderful photos, that it's rarely necessary to use the special settings. Like on an SLR, it's easy to adjust the aperture/shutterspeed on the fly to change the depth of field. The special \"scenes\" settings provide for very useful common settings such as pets/kids, indoors, beach, snow, and lots more. It's easy to control the built in flash, however the manual focus is such a nuisance to use that I never use it. The camera takes great movies, but I was surprised to find that zooming while filming a movie only adjusted digital zoom, not the optical zoom. To adjust the optical zoom, you must first zoom, then begin filming. The nearly HD movie mode works well but suffers from a limit of 15 fps, so I rarely use it, preferring the 640x480 mode at 30 fps, which gives better results. The camera feels really good in your hands, and all the controls are well placed and easy to understand. The LCD screen is super quality and bright enough to see on a beach. The viewfinder is, however, handy in some situations, but I must note that the lens is visible though the viewfinder. I have owned a lot of canon point and shoot cameras and this one is simply the best. It out performs the PowerShot SD series by so much as to put it much closer to SLR quality than point and shoot quality cameras, even though it is much closer in size to the PowerShot SD line.

It has an optical viewfinder that is all but worthless.The controls allow for fairly quick access to key exposure adjustments, but the sensor size limits the DOF range (not much difference between max f/2.8 and min f/8) so Aperture priority mode is not that useful over Program.  I avoid using direct flash, and other reviews have covered the usability of ISO over 400, thus this is basically an outdoor use camera, which serves my purposes fine.  The G9 has allowed me to get some shots while biking that would never have been possible with an SLR, and shooting RAW is critical to bringing out the best image quality in post processing.The built in neutral density \"filter\" is useful in shooting longer exposures during bright daylight, and the size allows for easy placement for bracketing exposures for HDR without needing a tripod.  Image quality at ISO 80 is excellent.In summary, if you are looking for a point & shoot, there are better values than the G9.  If you are looking to learn photography, you'd be better served with an entry level SLR - it will be quicker and more satisfying to use.

There is an aftermarket grip that can be attached and works well.2) Optical viewfinder.3) Dynamic range is limited ( ability to capture well images with very different areas of light and contrast ).  To be fair this is the case with all P and S and is a virtue of the tiny sensors.Things I liked1) Image quality in my opinion is better than the S5 IS that  I owned before.  The G9 does not show purple fringing...the S5 did.2) Solid build.3) Nice set of features.4) Ability to use Canon compatible external flashes.Overall a very nice little camera.", "Date": "January 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "your search stops with the G9", "Author": "J.

I skipped over the G8 since it did not offer the RAW mode, which the G9 does. After having shot almost 1000 pictures in all kinds of light situations during the last three weeks, I must say I am very pleased with the G9. It performs noticeable better than the G6. The sharpness and vividness of the pictures is remarkable, probably attributed to the optical image stabilization. Picture quality and coloring leaves no desires unfulfilled. The camera is noticeable faster than the G6, from startup, to zoom, to focus, to next shot. The picture review and menu respond snappier than the G6. The LCD is very bright and crisp and the colors appear to be very accurate.  Last but not least, the camera is very solidly built and feels quite nice in my hand.I wanted a top of the line digital camera which is still compact and not SLR. The G9 fulfills my expectations completely. Only two things I would wish for that the G9 had, but which I only used for about 5 % respectively 2 % of my shots on my G6, those being the movable LCD screen and the remote control. Just one small bit of advice. The battery which is shipped with the camera is only 720 mAh. I bought two after market batteries with 1200 mAh each for very little on line. These last of course a lot longer.Bottom line. I highly recommend the G9 to anyone looking for a top digital camera, with an extensive feature set, yet easy to operate, producing fantastic results - and not wanting to lug an SLR around.", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Top of the Line Point and Shoot", "Author": "R.

So that's what makes the G9 so much fun.First of all, the retro (Leica-look) style makes me think I can be the next Henri Cartier-Bresson!  With a small G9 in my pocket I can flip it out and capture all those \"decisive moments\" I miss with my big cameras (well, more like \"indecisive moments\" but I'm getting better).Next is all the new tools on the G9.  Face it, a big chunk of camera owners are gadget freaks.  You'll spend hours on end figuring out all the cool features in the G9.  From new Shooting settings to wide (16:9) frame  capture to image-stabilized video it's a dream toy.  Oh yeah, it's got RAW too.The video feature is great.  Anything you shoot on it can go on YouTube any day and look great.Let's talk quality.  It doesn't match the images I can get on my 5D.  If the ISO is over 200 noise creeps in.  Not bad but still the 12.1 sensor doesn't compare to DSLR quality.  But this camera is all about power and convenience which you can't get in a DSLR.

I never thought they could improve a picture this much. I know I haven't discovered all the features even when I already read the manual and I already feel like I have the exact manual setting for each picture.The camera feels heavy and very big compared with my brother's Canon Powershot SD-700, and in automatic control the pictures are almost the same, but when using manual control it just becomes the magic!!I strongly suggest you buy a tripod with this camera, as in some manual settings, in order to not increase the ISO, the camera should be intended to stay out of any movement.

I for one, do not. My point-of-view is positive and optimistic. And, I'll tell you exactly why I feel this way about the G9.First, if you're going to compare this camera to a DSLR, then you're absolutely foolish. There is no comparison, and it's absolutely ridiculous to even try. Why? Well the sensor size being one factor, and then the incredible lenses that are available on a DSLR. At this point, you either understand where I'm going with this, or you don't understand digital camera design.The best way to describe a G9 is to compare it to a Crossover SUV. It's not an SUV and it's not an automobile. Well, the G9 is not a DSLR, but it's also not just a plain point-and-shoot camera. For what it's worth, Canon did a great job taking the best from both sides and blending them to create what I consider the best compact camera available for the enthusiast digital camera photographer. For the size and money, you will NOT find anything better, more equipped, and more capable. I've been taking digital pictures since 1997, and I've yet to find something as well balanced in this form factor. It just doesn't exist. The competition has a lot of trade-offs, and sometimes they are not worth it. I've owned quite a few in the past, and I'm sold on this one. DSLR cameras are great, but they are not reasonable when it comes to everyday use. They are too large and not practical. Unless you're a professional. If you want something to take pictures of kids, take on vacation, use it for artistic flair; then the G9 does extremely well in this area.One of the most common complaints with the G9 (as wells as other compact cameras), is noise at high ISO levels. Well, that's a common trait that is shared with practically ever compact camera that uses a non-DSLR CCD sensor period! As far as I know, there are only two CCD sensors in this class; the one that SONY manufactures, and the one that FUJI manufacturers. The SONY CCD is most common in every camera. So if all compact cameras use the same CCD, wouldn't they all share the same common issues? The answer is \"Yes.\" However, if a compact camera has more manual flexibility and control, then it can better manage the trade-offs with the small CCD. And the G9 has that ability.So far, I'm seeing pretty sharp and accurate pictures between ISO 80 and 200. Even at ISO 400; compared to the competition, it's much better. Try doing that with a SONY camera - good LUCK! SONY cameras have a tendency to over-process the pictures and the contrast is FLAT. The pictures do not look real. The G9, takes very life-like pictures in comparison. The colors are accurate and the focus is always sharp, The DIGIC III does not over process the picture to the point where is looks dull at maximum magnification.Overall, this is a camera that is definitely worth the money. This will not disappoint. It's built like a tank and has SO MANY options and flexibility.

The infamous \"E18 lens error-restart camera\" fault. It renders the camera inoperative.  Fortunately,  I found a good repair place (CamerasandParts.com) to repair it for a reasonable charge.  The problems with this camera are well known and basically boil down to loose screws and untaped connectors inside the camera.  Shame on Canon!  For the price of this camera, these details should be handled at the factory quality control level.  The camera is also sensitive to shock (it apparently has an internal \"G\" sensor.  So, if you plan to carry it in your flight luggage, pack/cushion it very well.The good news is that this camera was the apex of the \"G\" series.  I am told that, in later series, Canon began outsourcing some of the component manufacture and changed digital sensors.  The results have been that newer cameras actually have poorer image quality.  I have a close friend who can attest to this, having upgraded from a G9 to a G12 and is now very unhapppy. (The more the megapixels, the smaller the individual pixel sensors, the less light  received per sensor, the higher the signal-to-noise ratio, etc).If you do experience problems with your G9, my advice is to cycle this camera through a reputable repair shop (such as the one mentioned) and have them do a total digital recalibration of the camera as well as fix the screw and connector problems.

The professional features found on this camera are impressive: image stabilization, lens vibration, raw format, 6x zoom lens w/ 4x digital zoom for a total of 10x... this list goes on and it is a very good list. Do not expect to use this camera to its full capabilities without putting in the time needed to understand its features. I would expect that anyone using this camera is of the type willing to take lessons or read/practice seriously in order to obtain the full benefit of the capabilities of this camera, but if you feel like just pointing and shooting, the G9 works with ease and is intuitive.The body of the camera feels great and has an excellent weight. The lcd screen is huge and easy to read. The layout of the camera makes a lot of sense and the software is easy to navigate. You'd think every company would design layouts that make sense, but trust me, they don't. The flash works decently, but to upgrade, the camera has a flash extension (puchase seperately) for better quality. You can replace the lens with other lenses including canon's pro-line (forgot the name off-hand) used on their SLR cameras as long as you get the adapter. Of course, the lens won't retract into the body if you do this. That is my favorite part about the camera: high-quality shots but it compacts into a tight package that is easy to bring anywhere. The memory card that comes stock is almost useless. I forget the size, but it's something like 32mb. Good luck trying to find its read/write time. First thing I did was spend another $75 on a 2-gig 20mb read/write extreme 3 card. The difference in response time between captures was obvious. Also there's a hard leather case made specifically for the G7/G9 that's around $20. Trust me, it's worth the money. $20 to keep this camera safe is a good investment. For long excursions, a second battery is necessary. Canon's is more expensive and its specs don't read as well as some third party types, but every third party type I've tried failed to work correctly (huge loss of battery life or just complete failure) within 1-3 months.

Who could design a camera where BOTH the viewfinder (so important in bright daylight and for reading glasses wearers in various situations where one doesn't have time to put them on and see the LCD clearly), AND the LCD itself BOTH show an image of a different size than what you will eventually download to your computer? It's a horrid flaw. The views in the LCD are ~10% larger than the captured image, and the viewfinder allows one to see only about 75-80% of what will comprise the final image.Thus one can shoot what the viewfinder shows and later crop the unseen/unwanted edges and discard 20% of the pixels on every shot, but always get a full image of the subject, or one can use the LCD and try to make sure the desired image is close, but not TOO close, to the edges of what the LCD shows, because one will lose tops of steeples, tops of trees, peoples' hair, etc, etc., repeatedly, if one has not developed interpolation skills to overcome these viewing size mismatches. You'd think they'd have made ONE of the two viewing tools produce a WYSIWYG final image (WYSIWYG = Silicon Valley-speak for \"what you see is what you get\", an Apple innovation from the ancient era of Pac-Man and 128MB microprocessors). This engineering lunacy makes the camera always annoying. One can work around this stupidity with great success; I always try to take extra images while interpolating off the LCD. But despite such attempts to compensate, even the experienced user occasionally gets that clipping off of items one wanted intact at the top edge of the frame...WHY WHY WHY couldn't they have made at least the LCD WYSIWYG?

Barnes \"Brian P\"", "ReviewID": "R1BE9BLEXWZWB6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have both the G7 and the G9. The 2 extra megapixels are unnoticeable. The reason I purchased this camera for my recent vacation was the ability to use RAW mode which works so well on my Nikon D200 (for which this is my backup camera). After using it for a month, it has near zero advantages over the highly functional G7.While it can capture a good image, the only way to convert the raw image to a jpg is to use their wimpy, me-too image editor, one at a time. Their batch convert gives the error message: \"Unable to export movies, sound files or raw images\". Additionally, I see another error message about \"Information added by [various programs] will not be included in the exported images\" which indicates to me that any titles, captions or key words you enter will be destroyed.I tried both the CD sold with the camera as well as the most recent upgrades of both the zoom browser and the eos utility on both my laptop as well as my desktop, each a standard XP machine with the latest patches. The errors follow the software, not the machine.The functionality of their software is abysmal. For instance, when browsing you can't use the left and right arrow buttons like most other, modern image viewers support; you must use their next button. The performance in rendering the image is roughly 20 times slower than Photoshop or Bibble when rendering a raw image. You see tiny, 1/2 inch chunks appear on the screen in a very tedious rendering process making me wonder whether they are using decade old, recycled, 16 bit code to save money for canon.After taking over 1200 images on vacation, mostly in raw mode, I have no way to extract them from the canon proprietary \".CR2\" format other than spending days doing each one by hand with an extremely slow, klunky, proprietary program. At roughly a minute each, it would take 20 hours of hand editing to convert each by hand. Picasa shows the images, but the colors are horribly mangled. I can only select a few of the very best images to process by hand and wait for Bibble to support the G9 raw format in batch mode.canon technical support claims to provide \"no hassles, no run-around, total satisfaction\" while on hold. The support person person told me that I was free to use any third party conversion software but could not suggest one. She offered no diagnostic support whatsoever nor any comment on the error messages. Am I dealing with burger flippers turned technical supporters ;-o ?Canon, please get out of the software business in which you have negligible competence, stick to making camera hardware and hire a qualified third party like Bibble Labs to write functional image processing software for you.My recommendation is to avoid the G9 until the raw mode conversion works in batch mode with user input annotations.Update: after a half hour wait on technical support hold, it has just been confirmed that the export function is broken for raw (\".CR2\") files and that individual hand processing, one at a time, is required to export raw files to .jpg or .tif.Claiming to support both raw and .jpg images is one thing. Omitting a clear and conspicuous disclaimer warning that raw file batch processing is broken in their software would seem to be a gross oversight if not an unconscionable withholding of critical information from potential buyers.Very unhappy with the camera package. :-(", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wonderful!!!", "Author": "Cheryl Fleischer \"Chere2u\"", "ReviewID": "RM84J760GQ9J6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it.

I am an architect, and have traveled extensively around the world using this camera for both professional and personal use.The great thing about the G9, is that it is a very effective Prosumer camera that bridges between the point and shoot, and the digital SLR's.  I also bought a high quality aluminum finished wide angle lens adapter from Lensmate, that simply screws in front of the lens when you remove the O-ring around the lens. This effectively brings it up to 24mm wide angle from the current 28mm, and for architecture and buildings, makes an enormous difference. [...] to learn more about this really high quality company that makes lens adaptors specifically for the Canon line....in fact, their wide angle lens is not only much higher quality than what Canon sells, but is much more compact, made out of milled aluminum instead of plastic (Canon's version), and costs less!I recently just got back from India, and took some amazing photos from that exotic country. Before that, I have used it in south america, patagonia region, Peru (macchu picchu), thailand, africa throughout asia....and have shot thousands of photos over these past several years, I still marvel at what a perfect camera this is for so many different uses and conditions.I looked at the G10, but like several other readers comments, I came back to the G9 as actually superior, and in fact bought myself another G9 as a back-up.  It is interesting on amazon that the g9 in fact sells for quite a bit more than the g10 or the current g11 version....and I think it is because serious photographers realize just how good the g9 is.If you can get your hands on one (if not amazon, try ebay), you won't be dissapointed, and I have yet to see the need to go the the digital SLR camera yet, even with all the professional work I do which requires hi-res and quality images.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "canon g9 is one of the best point and shoots around", "Author": "Musicman", "ReviewID": "RWBWEX285YQ4H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am here to save you time on your research....So here it goes.

As people have stated above ISO 400 begins some noise appears.....so just keep it between 80-200 ISO and you will be fine. As for the video the Canon G9 takes you can't find one thats better. It has great low-light capablities and a stereo sound that is sweet to your ears. I have taken some really nice short videos at dusk and they were incredible. Also I love the timelapse mode which the G10 is lacking. The only thing that I wish about the Canon G9 is the RAW files can't be opened in Canons DPP software like the Canon G10....so I use Corel Paint Shop Pro X2 for those RAW files.....Most of the time though I just shoot JPEGS with the 12 megapixel setting.

But a lot of times you just don't want to lug it all around, or even get it out just to take a couple of quick shots.  I really wanted to get a good \"point and shoot\" but I didn;t want to compromise on images and say, \"I wish I got my good camera out\".So I did a lot of searching and playing with various cameras and ultimately I selected the Canon G9 and here's why...1.  It has a huge LCD display so you can hold the camera away from you and still see what you're shooting at, even from odd angles.  Checking photos after the shot is easy too without having to zoom in all the time.2.  It's fully automatic if you want to leave it that way or you can fully customize it with shutter-priority, aperture priority, fully manual... basically almost everything you can do with your DSLR.  So you can manage depth of field, etc. with ease.3.  The ability to add on the telephoto lens and converter is great... effectively gives it a 400MM optical zoom.  I haven't tried the wide lens since the camera lens is wide enough for me.4.  It's image stabilization works well... great for low light shots without a flash without compromising on image quality by using a higher ISO.5.  Finally - the ability to use an external flash is terrific.  I already had the 580EX but wanted to get a 430EX as a \"slave\" - this gave me the reason to do so, as a 430EX looks much better on the G9 and works great. (The 580 works too but it's so much bigger.Are there compromises with the G9?  I suppose so but not too many.  It's not the smallest camera out there.  It fits in a jacket pocket but not a shirt pocket.  Also, it would be if the G9 and it's Raw photos could be managed with Canon's Digital Photo Professional software.  But having two sets of software for my Canon cameras isn't that big a deal.In the end - I think it's a great little camera and with the add-ons of lenses and external flash - it gives you big camera benefits from a little camera package.", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon G9 Camera - Great Pictures", "Author": "K.

I've only had it for two months but I take it everywhere - the office, shopping, etc.  My regular camera when out shooting landscapes is my Nikon D300, and a series of lenses from the venerable Nikon 17-55 F2.8 (purchased here on Amazon for 1150.00) down to a first generation Lensbaby and everything in between.This little G9, which I immediately set to capture jpeg+raw is excellent.  I love sharp, crisp images and I hate noise.  So, I try to keep it at under ISO 100 --usually set to ISO 80.  The IS feature is amazing as well.  It truly works miracles when handholding.The camera, once you get to know it is easy to operate on the fly.  That is very important to me.  No twiddling.  The supplied software which is called the Zoom Browser I've only used a few times as it's the ONLY way to get to the RAW editor!  How funky is that?  I am a Adobe Lightroom user so I really don't need it.  I upload everything into Lightroom and go from there.  I have used the Canon software just to see what it does but quite frankly it is so clunky I don't bother.As far as image quality, the jpegs coming out of this camera are so sharp, and clear and colorful that I find myself not using the raw files.  However as a shooting pro some of my stock agents REQUIRE me to submit the converted raw file after they have accepted the initial jpeg after their review.  So... I'm stuck keeping the CR2 raw file around.In a few weeks I'm going on a photo shoot and I am taking my Nikons and my gaggle of gear but my intentions on this trip are to shoot ALL my landscapes and other shots with the G9.

It's reliable, takes mostly excellent pictures and is fully customizable - kind of a mini DSLR.  You can't change lenses without purchasing additional adapters, but then I wanted a small, light, transportable camera without having to lug around extra lenses.  I also wanted video capabilities.I have only a few complaints:1.  Wide angle is sorely lacking...could use a wider lense.2.  There is a lot of chromatic aberration (purple and red fringing) especially in back lit shots inside (around windows in daytime).  I have learned to Photoshop them out to a certain extent, but that is something I hope they've fixed in subsequent models.3.  It has a bit of a problem focusing on monochromatic things like black dogs, clouds or large areas of the same color especially at long distances.4.  Either I haven't learned how to do flash photography or this flash is too strong for a lot of inside shots.  It washes out faces unless you are a good distance away from the subject.  Get up close and this gets worse.  I have a plant that blooms only at night.  The flowers are white and very large (dinner plate size).  The flash severely washes out the inside of the flower and turning it off results in an extremely yellow color cast.  I have been unable thus far to eliminate this dark of a color cast in Photoshop.I've learned more about the \"Megapixel myth\" since my purchase and it seems to apply here.  12.1MP is too much to cram into a CCD - this doesn't result in better resolution than my old Fujifilm at 6MP or my husband's 6MP, $1500 Nikon D70S (the only reason I bought the Canon was to replace the broken Fujifilm). It's a hard concept to grasp, but I learned the hard way that a high MP count does NOT make better pictures.Bright sunny days outside are this camera's forte.  I have taken many excellent (in my opinion) shots of the mountains where I live and other scenery.  I've gotten some good portrait shots inside (not all - better ones outside) and some good stop action of birds with the continuous mode.The video does an excellent job even at night.  I took several videos of the Bellagio Fountains in Vegas that turned out great, except I couldn't get all of it in due to the wide angle problem (I was right on the rail closest to them).Using the digital zoom produces a more \"fuzzy\" shot when hand held.  It would be best to use a tripod for these.All in all, I love this camera.  Unless it breaks, I won't be replacing it anytime soon.

Richmond \"AZBuyer2007\"", "ReviewID": "R22GPK3G750POJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I don't want to be a party pooper, so rated the camera a 4 star. With regard to my points below, it should have been a 2-3 star, but that would spoil the G9 overall rating, which should be very good. My review is tailored for those wanting high quality editable RAW images using the Canon G9. For that, I give it a 2-3 star compared to Rebel XTI. So on with the review...Here is my warning to many of you thinking of purchasing the Canon G9 camera and using it for shooting RAW mode images. If you didn't know, RAW is the best way to obtain nicely composed pictures; i.e., since many of us are amateurs and cannot compose nicely in the field, RAW allows you to tweak the image in the \"LAB\" on your PC to produce a very good to excellent shot from a bad to average one. If you are into nature and sports photography, you often don't have time to nicely compose (even as an expert), so RAW helps in that scenario too.I own a Rebel XTI, and use DPP (Digital Photo Professional 3.4.1.1 as of this writing). In general, I was very happy with my XTI + RAW + DPP 3.4 solution. DPP is Canon\u00a1\u00a6s software that comes with EOS cameras for processing RAW images. My Rebel XTI problem was weight on long backpacking and climbing trips--carrying 5# worth of camera is a bit rough with a 50# pack. It's also kind of dangerous to have a large camera readily exposed when you are exposed on a face or steep slope. So I bought a Canon G9, thinking G9 + RAW + DPP 3.4 = excellent compromise between weight and quality, since G9 can shoot in Raw mode and weighs < 1#.Well, that didn't quite result in image happiness, and here's why: First Canon G9 can only shoot to F8. I like high F-stop for nice crisp pictures of leaves, rock details, people's faces, etc. F8 seemed a bit low for this. In other words, my sharpness levels with camera were not quit there. Secondly, I like to bracket shoot. (3 exposures at a time with different lighting level). This helps me, especially as an amateur. With the G9, bracketing is possible, but takes like 3-4 seconds to complete the 3 image cycle, compared to <1 with the Rebel XTI. So I get a lot less chance of nice image since bracketing for 3 seconds is a pain and often results in too much blur (shake).Well, ok for my poor ability. The RAW conversion software will handle that, right? Wrong. First off, you cannot use DPP 3.4.1.1 to edit Canon G9 images. Seems like a poor marketing decision by some bozo who didn\u00a1\u00a6t want to let the el-cheapie camera users have access to a nice quality image editing software. I did verify this with Canon tech support today though, so it's a fact.Well, Ok... Thought I: I'll just use the Raw Image Task (RIT) to process my photos.\u00a8 RIT = Canon's budget software for point-and-shoots that can actually shoot RAW. The problem with this is that RIT is seriously deficient in many regards, as summarized below. NOTE: These lacking features are found in DPP 3.4.1.1 (but you need an EOS Raw image for that). In other words G9 Raw images are stuck to RIT for processing*.1. RIT clunkiness: RIT requires ZoomBrowser (ZB is an OK viewer by the way) to start. You launch RIT from ZB. Once in RIT, to edit, your view features are substantially limited. Its generally clunky, as described below. For example, to use the tools palette, I must scroll the tools palette window slider up and down to access all the features controls. So I set exposure for example and then scroll down to adjust the sharpness slider. Way too much work to process photos quickly!2. RIT doesn't allow you to adjust color spectrum in Histogram. This is nice sometimes for creativity, but not possible in RIT.3. RIT Redraws are very slow: When scrolling from one image to the next, RIT presents a blurred image and then redraws it to a sharper level while you wait. The wait is annoying.4. RIT cannot do linear contrast. I like linear contrast setting for creativity. I have gotten some of my best snow shots by setting linear contrast.5. RIT JPG production is time-intensive. Conversion of images to JPG output takes about 2-3x longer than with DPP. So, take a shower, make some breakfast... and read some news during a big conversion batch. ;)6. RIT cannot do cropping: You feel the camel's back getting heavier? In order to crop, you have to go back to ZB or another program after converting the image to JPG. This is an extra time-consuming confusing step. This sucks bigtime!7. RIT (or Canon CODEC bug) with sharpness (I tried CODEC's 1.2 and 1.3 by the way): As mentioned earlier, I like high F-stop shots. Since G9 goes only to F8, it's a bit lacking, so I thought I could count on sharpness control in RIT to make me happy. Well, in RIT, I can adjust the sharpness and get a nicely composed, crisp picture. But when I convert to JPG, I get a dull, unsharp picture. To make matters worse, when I close RIT and go back to ZB, I see the original picture, not my edited one. This was the straw that broke the camels back for me.So I emailed Canon tech-support, and after 1 erroneous suggestion, my tech support case went into a blackhole. The answer given to me was like an auto-responder reading my problem and spitting out a canned suggestion as a \"while you wait for a real person's reply, please try this.\u00a8 The initial advice (coming from a real live tech support staff) was to upgrade software, even though I initially opened the case with a list of detailed and documented software versions, which were the most current before I even thought about opening the case. ;) I kind of new I was in for trouble after getting his \"upgrade-your-software\u00a8 reply. I emailed him back this fact and waited about 1-2 weeks for another answer, but got none. When worked settled down, I decided I need to solve this problem, so called Canon phone support. They had no way of looking up my tech support case opened via website since they were operating on two different support databases. I thought this was weird, but no biggy, and just provided all my details over the phone again.After providing details, the lady on the phone was unable to answer my question adequately and didn\u00a1\u00a6t seem to give me any alternatives. Although she was nice and tried, I just think Canon didn't provide her with adequate training to solve a complex, geek-based question. She talked to a colleague after putting me on hold and found out DPP couldn't process G9 Raw images. She also recommended converting to TIFF for better quality output. Unfortunately, I had already tried that with similar bad results. \"Can you notate this as a bug for the developers to investigate,\u00a8 I asked? I told her I think it's a RIT/CODEC bug with the sharpness feature that needs investigating. She said \"Canon doesn't think that there is a bug and all the developers are in Japan.\u00a8 Well that told me she wasn't connected enough in Canon to actually solve my problem. Japan or USA, you can enter data into a bug tracking program if you have one. So I asked her for any other options and she mentioned just waiting for further software updates. I ended the call politely, with the words Nikon thrown in there a few times and decided I would write this review.In summary, I have taken some excellent shots with my Rebel XTI. I like it a lot. I also like DPP. I am just not happy with the ability to produce professional results with the Canon G9. I think the G9 is an excellent camera for many individuals. For me though, the above should indicate I am seeking a bit more. If you are like me, and take amateur pictures, but want high-grade output, perhaps, you should think twice about using the G9. I hope this review helps you. ;)* CAVEAT: You may be able to find photo-editor software (such as Adobe) to solve many of these RIT problems. But you will also pay more, probably $200-$500, for this software. For that price difference, you could upgrade to a Rebel XTI camera and get DPP. If any of you have experience with good-quality RAW software, please email me.===================PART 2====================Based on feedback, I test-shot a few roses a few hours before sunset. I ran some tests at different ISO ratings and different F-stops. All shots were with the G9.I then processed the images using RIT (Raw Image Task v3.3) and RT (Raw Therapee V2.3). I included some links for you to evaluate. I made first 2 shots by opening up the respective application editor window, and also opening up the resulting JPG from that application. Then put them side by side and took a screen shot, which then gets converted into a JPG. Not the best method. Anyway, here are the links:Raw Image Task (F5, 1/80, ISO100):[...]Raw Therapee (F5, 1/80, ISO100):[...]Raw Therapee (Bee, F4.8, 1/150, ISO100):[...]I make several conclusions with these tests:1) RIT really sucks as one poster has stated: Look at the editor and JPG comparisons in above link! These images look nothing alike! Not only is sharpness off, but contrast and color saturation seem to be whacked. In a funny way though, the image in the editor window looks really good (but I don't want to screen shot every image I edit to make a JPG. ;)2) RT produces very close to editor output. In other words what you see is really what you get. RT also does pretty good on sharpness levels. RT is a pretty good program. I wish it had preset color definitions though, like nature, etc. that you find in canon software. All-in-all, when they get batch processing and make it speedier, I think it will kick some butt.3) F8 diffraction is an issue, but probably wasn't affecting my images as much as thought. In other words, even changing F-stop down to F5 or F4.8, for example, didn't result in a noticeably sharper picture. Take a look at the RT Bee shot above, which was shot at F4.8. It still has a particular dullness, for example looking at the veins in the rose petals.4) DSLR spoils you: Even though RT is true to form, I still notice sharpness loss in the RT image (point 3). I don't know what to call this. Perhaps \"Point-and-Shoot dullness.\" My example and other \"expert\" point and shoot examples, just look kind of dull, compared to my XTI shots. I am not an expert, so this could be attributed to me shooting poorly, or some other factor. All-in-all, I think I have been spoiled by my Rebel XTI.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "One amazing Canon", "Author": "Daniela Lorenzo Burger", "ReviewID": "R1HXOATDQOTWE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it, It feels so great.

I am currently very interested in photography and so I was in the market to buy a camera a few months ago. I browsed Amazon for Canon digital cameras, as I heard from a friend that Canon was the best. I found this camera and read the product description, as well as the reviews. This prompted me to buy it, which turned about to be a VERY good investment. If you are like me, new to photography and very unexperienced, this camera is definitely worth buying to learn how to take good pictures. It had millions of different functions that allow you to learn about what each one does and how they will work to help your photos come out amazing. The manual that comes with the camera is extremely helpful, especially if you are inexperienced or if this is you first camera ever. I doubt this review is helpful, as I can't compare it with other cameras because this is my first camera. However, the reaction that I get from people who see my photos or when I show them what I can do with it is always, \"Wow, that's amazing!\" or \"It has how many megapixels!?\" I am really happy with the zooming capabilities.

Not wanting to have to send it back, I thought since I could hear a motor turn after the camera was powered up, that I might be able to fix it if something was loose.  Wrong.  There is a ring around the lens, and the user manual said that if you press the ring release button, you could rotate the ring and change lenses.  This didn't work so well, the lens became loose, so I had to send it back to Canon.I sent it to their repair facility, and they sent me a letter saying since the lens was broken, they would have to charge me $120.  I agreed to that, since I shouldn't have attempted to fix it myself, but then a week or so later they called me up at 7am to tell me they couldn't fix it at all.  They said when they looked further, the noticed that there was damage from liquid.  I told them this was not possible, as the camera was never exposed to liquids while it was in my possession.  One of their reps said something about corrosion, but I don't think I owned it long enough for it to be corroded by anything I would have done anyway.So I am out the $500 I paid for it, and I will never buy another Canon product again.  It's their word against mine, and I know the camera was never exposed to liquids while I owned it, so they are calling me a liar.  My only recourse, as I told them, is to tell everybody I know they can't be trusted. So here I am, telling even people I don't know, don't trust Canon.

I've got the Canon 5D, which is a very impressive camera, but wanted a good quality point and shoot. Researched for days, read all the reviews, finally ordered the G9. I just couldn't wait until it arrived!! Got here in two days, felt nice and sturdy when I took it out of the box, 3\" LCD Screen is HUGE, controls are easy to get to...but after \"battling\" with it for the last 24 hours, I am terribly disappointed. It's going back.This camera's \"AUTO\", P, TV and AV functions are absolutely useless. The G9 is unable to balance highlights and shadows. It blows out the highlights, which is even more aggravated by the quality of the LCD screen. When you get the shot on the computer, it's not nearly as bad as it looked on the screen, but, it's still bad. With a herculean effort, you can get a decent (not great, but okay) shot in Manual, but if I wanted to work that hard I'd just pull out the 5D.The image stabilization feature totally ruins the shot with noise, it looks like you've \"sharpened\" it to the hilt in photoshop...took me awhile to figure out why everything looked almost \"crystallized\"...so you have to have the IS turned off and without it, the G9 is just not a low light camera. The Flash really produces a very strangely colored shot, which really IS as bad on the computer as it looks on the LCD screen.The color on the LCD screen is really washed out so you can't see if any shot you take under any lighting conditions shot is usable...or should I say \"fixable\" in PhotoShop, because none of the 250 shots I took today were \"usable\" straight off the camera...until you download it to the computer.

I didn't want to have to buy a DSLR and a compact camera to get everything I used to get in one good workhorse. That is why I researched all sorts of cameras for several months before deciding on the G9. In theory it appeared to have all the qualities of both in one camera.I specifically wanted a camera that was physically small enough to become a permanent attachment for those spontaneous shots, one that could take candid shots without spooking people, extra optical zoom, high megapixels so I could print large-sized photos, one that would take spectacular macros.I also needed a camera to take good, clear, close-up photos of jewelry for online sales. I take hundreds of jewelry photos per week, and don't have time to color-correct them all in an editing program. Perhaps I got a lemon, I don't know, I'll try another G9 from a local camera shop before I completely jump ship on this one although at this point I'm pretty gun-shy about Canon.The white balance totally sucks when using the G9 in the studio under ECA lamp bulbs, even when setting the custom white balance using a grey card (or any other color card for that matter). Cyan colors in turquoise and other glue-green gems are interpreted as plain old blue, even in RAW mode. I have an old Sony DSC-S75 that records turquoise as true turquoise under ECA bulbs without any color-correcting needed. I have asked numerous people about this issue, one professional said my Sony was the exception and that most compact cameras have problems interpreting the cyan colors correctly under artificial light. Even directly speaking to the Canon support representative produced no comments or solutions to this issue, it was as if they never heard of this problem before.The battery life is unacceptably short. Apparently this is an issue with other Canon compacts as well from what I've read. I thought it was just because I had the camera on a lot trying to learn how to use the features, but even so the battery should last longer than a day. When I finally did have one of those great spontaneous photo moments, the battery died almost immediately and I had to use my trusty old Sony dinosaur instead.There is a blue cast to the live view screen, but I have noticed that when I download the photos, they all have a slight blue cast when viewed on my computer. Blue seems to be the G9's favorite color. Probably okay for average amateur shots, definitely not acceptable for professional product shots or award-winning photos (like my old Sony has done for me).Macros were okay but not likely to win ribbons. I had trouble getting the G9 to focus on what I wanted it to focus on, and I had tremendous trouble trying to get a sharp photo of earrings hanging on a display, it just would not get it all in focus no matter what settings I tried and, believe me, I tried all sorts of tricks.

Until I recently bought a Canon 30D, my main camera was a Canon G-5.  There is no question about its superior image quality and its rugged build, but the best thing was the LCD which flips out and tilts up or down.  This meant if the only way to get your shot was to stand on a ladder or lay on the ground, you could set the LCD so that you could look straight up at it while holding the camera over your head or set the LCD so that you could look into it while  bending over and holding the camera close to the ground.  It had the added advantage of enabling you to compose and shoot in stealth mode by not having to hold the camera to your eye.  In fact, of the thousands of images I shot with my G-5, I only looked through the viewfinder a dozen times or less. I hope no one takes offense at this not being a review of the G-9, but I've been wanting to whine to someone about Canon turning their back on the incredible feature they discontinued after the G-5. Video cameras still have this type of LCD, but as far as I know it has entirely disappeared from the world of still cameras.  My experience with Canons and with the G series tells me even without that wonderful pan and tilt LCD viewfinder, this might be the best camera you can buy short of a reflex, and maybe better given its small size and low price which is quite a bargain compared to the $850 paid for my G-5 just a few years ago.

But that's where it fails miserably. While the industry is trying to standardize image formats, Canon chose to introduce yet another propriatary raw format. Photoshop doesn't recognize it. Both Apple's Aperature and Lightzone can open the file, but the white point is w_a_y off. So one must load Canon's kludgy image browser/image processor (yet /more/ software and disk space and time) only because of Canon's format decision.This is one of many nice snapshot cameras if you only shoot JPGs. If you're a serious photographer, then save your money in case the Sigma DP-1 turns out to not be vaporware.And it looks like maybe Canon is distancing itself from this thing; their camera registration link for the G9 is dead.", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very Poor Customer Support - PC Downloads Unreliable", "Author": "Paul A.

I recently changed my laptop to one with a Windows Vista operating system. Canon does not provide drivers for the G2 to download pictures onto Vista. So I can no longer download directly via cable from camera to PC. I have just purchased a card reader ($30) - hopefully it works, otherwise I will no longer be able to print, share or store my photos taken on an expensive camera purchased only 5 years ago. I called Canon technical support about this. They were very unhelpful and complacent. Essentially, they said technology changes and they could or would do nothing about it. The lesson here is clear : DON'T RISK BUYING EXPENSIVE CAMERAS, PRINTERS, SCANNERS ETC. FROM A COMPANY THAT DOESN'T THINK LONG TERM SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT !!
