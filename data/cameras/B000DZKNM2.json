That camera had performed well for many years, and indeed still works the same as when it was new. We wanted something a little smaller and with higher resolution. Turn on time was also a problem- often by the time I had the camera powered up and ready to shoot the moment had passed!I looked around a LOT and was ready to purchase a Canon, but then a visitor from China showed me his Sony DSC-T50 (which had just been released in the US at the time) and I was convinced it was the way to go. While I was reading up on the T50 I found a lot of references to the N2. From what I could tell, the N2 had the same great touchscreen plus a few more advanced features and a higher resolution. The lower price was icing on the cake.This is a \"family\" camera- nearly all our pictures are of our kids. The great thing about this camera is the large screen and the ability to easily and clearly show off your pictures to the rest of the family without having to gather around a computer.I think the touch screen is great. I like not having a camera full of more buttons than I'll ever figure out how to use. For someone that wants full manual control over all the shots I suspect an SLR type camera is the way to go. For someone who will be taking 95% of their shots in the default \"auto\" mode, I think this is the way to go.I've taken some shots at night with mixed results. I took some pictures of a house during Halloween which was decorated with orange string lights. Holding the camera by hand produced one clear image out of three. I've found the best thing to do is set the camera down and use the 2 second timer to take pictures in extremely low light conditions. In dim light (not twilight) it does better, and in normal cloudy to daylight conditions pictures are great.Overall I'm most pleased with the small size of the camera and the large touchscreen. The turn-on time is fast too. I've taken some movies of the kids playing and dancing and they turned out excellent. I purchased a gigabyte of memory for the camera, particularly for use with the movie mode. Battery life is good too, even with such a large screen.I'd recommend this camera to anyone wishing to catch a growing family on \"film\".", "Date": "November 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Compact Digital!!", "Author": "SJH AZ", "ReviewID": "R12ZP3P2QI6PFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I choose this camera because of its small size, 10 megapixels, large bright screen and previous good luck with Sony. I also bought the 4 gig card as I wanted capacity for a lot of high resolution pics.The touch screen is GREAT!! You can figure out most of the features of the camera right away just using the touch menu.I hooked the camera up to my PC without additional software and it worked instantly with windows. The picture quality, resolution and color are nothing short of AMAZING on a pc monitor, Photo quality in ten megapixels is incredible....I have had several other Nikon & Sony digital camera's but nothing like the picture quality of this one in 10.1 mode.The camera actually lets you build photo slide shows with built in special effects and music (downloaded or already on the camera).Ease of use, picture quality, large bright screen, small size and touch menu system make this a true \"Best in Class\".Cant go wrong with this one.", "Date": "November 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "The BEST Camera Ever!", "Author": "B.

As others wrote, there is still much to be discovered as I continue to learn and read the manual, but I took pictures immediately. It is easier to use and quicker to change settings during picture taking events. The low light photos are great, as are action shots. The large viewing screen is wonderful. I looked at the 10 megapixel SLR cameras, but to have that capability in such a small format fit my needs so much better. My pictures are clear and close and great for croping and enlarging.

Ironically, the one I had about four years ago with 3.3. MP seems to have taken the best pictures of all, which I attribute to the telescopic (as opposed to internal) zoom lens.  Comparing several cameras, it just seems this particular feature results in sharper, more dynamic photos.  I was pleased to find the DSC-N2 went back to a telescopic lens in a compact style.  The photos are fantastic and the camera is easy to use (once you get used to touch screen for everything).  So I give the camera itself high marks.  The reason for giving it a 1 star is this:  The camera died after three months.  It was working fine, I was in the middle of taking a shot when suddenly the camera froze.  That was it.  I buy enough electronics to know this happens from time to time and shouldn't be an overall deterrent.  There's always a chance of a bad one in the bunch.  However, the treatment from Sony was so appalling that I felt the need to offer this warning to others.  I called Sony, they agreed it was still under warranty and asked that I mail it to the repair center.  I get a call from them a week later telling me the camera suffered from internal corrosion caused by water moisture and is therefore not covered by the warranty (their policy is that the warranty does not cover any external or internal damage.  Go figure).  They told me it looked as if the camera had been submerged in water.  I explained that didn't happen, but they would only go on what their technician told them.  Evidentially a simple humid environment can cause internal corrosion.  I was near the ocean.  Go figure.  The cost to repair the camera was $586.  They're only other solution was for me to purchase a brand new one from them at a cost of $250.  Obviously others are having good luck with their N2, but if this camera is so susceptible to humidity, one might consider an extended accidental warranty with the purchase.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT !!!!", "Author": "Nina Garcia", "ReviewID": "R2R5XZWWUTU42Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera mainly for the one feature the others don't offer which is the High Sensitivity function (ISO 1600), it is fantastic, I am taking pictures in thick fog at night and they are amazingly clear and sharp,no flash needed at all , sunsets come out beautiful.As far as I know this is the only compact point and shoot to have this feature, which only came in the bigger Digital SLRs.Also the writing on the screen feature is fun, and the touchscreen navigation is easy and quick to do.One thing I haven't done yet is to figure out how to see the screen in bright sunlight, anyone have any suggestions?", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "SONY CYBER SHOT AWESOME CAMERA", "Author": "faith \"Faith\"", "ReviewID": "R35TAMPK11GUFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband bought me this camera for Christmas last year.

When I opened my Christmas gift, I was sadden to read the name SONY on the box.First, I charged the battery and then slid in the 2 GIG memory stick.  Without reading a single page of instructions, I was SHOCKED to discover how easy the camera operated.  TOUCH SCREENS seem complictaed, but this was a joy to use.  I will never go back to a button operated hand held camera again.Second, with the combination of a quality optical lens and an incridible 10.1 MP photo, I was shocked at the quality of the images.  Never have I seen so many options so easily adjusted as this camera offers.Lastly, friends have invested twice as much to purchase large SLR style digital cameras and their photos have been half the quality.  This camera has been well designed for the novice user, but with the specialized adjustments allows the mature user to optimize their photography skills to excel at near professional quality for a fraction of the cost.BOTTOM LINE:  This camera is a winner.  Cost is excellent.  Image adjustments offer excellent images.

I liked the features and the large 3\" LCD screen but I was a little nervous about the touch screen.  However, after reading a few reviews that I would give it a try.  The touch screen works great and the camera takes great pictures.  It has a very fast startup and quickly saves the pictures without a noticeable delay even using the highest resolution.  It has high ISO sensitivity and when activated takes great pictures in almost pitch black conditions.

It maybe expensive but it really is worth it. 10.1 Megapixel, compact size, and a beautiful crisp 3in LCD screen that also functions as a touch screen. That's cool. The only thing that I was kind of disapointed in was that the pictures get pretty grainy the higher ISO especially past 1000 . that's to be expected for any digi cam but I didn't think it would be that grainy. However that doesn't bother me much since I don't take many picutres at night. I took me one month to decided to buy this camera. I wish I had bought it sooner.", "Date": "February 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "The N2 is a winner!", "Author": "Michael Olshansky", "ReviewID": "R78IVT5M4WKJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking to replace my 4 megapixel digicam and did a ton of research looking for the ideal replacement.  In the end, the CyberShot DSC-N2 is a winner.This unit is lightning fast, takes great pictures in low light, has a killer movie mode, and a really nice photo album feature.The detail captured by the 10.1mp CCD is stunning. Anyone that says \"you don't need more megapixels unless you're making large prints\" is either lying or uneducated when it comes to digital cameras.  I took pictures of the same subjects with several lower megapixels cameras and the N2.  The differences were literally night and day.Unlike some older Cybershots, this unit's Auto mode is fantastic, making the right adjustments 99% of the time.  This is what a consumer point-and-shoot is supposed to do.Some may gripe about the lack of a stabilizer, but quite frankly, the N2 doesn't need it.  I took tons of pictures in overcast conditions and out of 55 photos, the flash fired 3 times.  Most consumer point-and-shoot cams would have fired the flash 40-50 times in the same conditions.  Quite simply, this is such a fine camera in low light that the flash wasn't necessary!  The pictures all came out fabulous!The movie mode is very nice on the Fine setting, though it uses ancient MPEG1 technology which eats up space fast and is difficult to convert to modern formats such as MP4 or DiVX.  The video converts, but the audio doesn't.  I wish Sony would use something a little more modern in that regard.The battery life is also very good for a camera with a 3\" LCD.  I got about 80 shots and a dozen movies before the battery called it quits.  If you are using it more than this, an extra battery can't hurt.The 3\" touch-screen LCD is fantastic, though it's very difficult to see in direct sunlight.  The touch screen interface is pretty easy to use, though it does have some quirks that may confuse less technical folks.  The main complaint is that the \"Main\" menu feels incomplete since I have to jump around to find the exact setting I was looking for.Flash range is above average for a compact digicam.  It should be fine for most people.As for the unit itself, it's clean, attractive, and simple.  It fits in the pocket easily and seems fairly durable, though I recommend some sort of case to protect the touch screen.  It seems pretty tough, but I'm not taking any chances.I chose the N2 after comparing to units from Panasonic, Olympus, Fuji, and Canon.

The screen size is great but the logic of navigation behind the touch screen is too complex: there are too many menus to select before getting the option you are looking for (for example, the delete function). The stylus pen is the first thing you lose and there is no standard USB connector on this camera : you have to use the cable provided with the camera which is cumbersome and you have to keep it with you when you go to see friends and want to show/copy your photos on their computer (unless they have a card reader compatible with the mini memory stick). When you zoom in a photo, there is too much \"noise\" in the photos, which is strange for a 10 megapixel camera.

That should validate my opinion it is a great camera. Also, bought one for office use.  Most people are surprised when I show them the large photobooks of images produced with this camera. The difference between N2 and N1 is simply the megapixels:  10.1 MP versus 8.1.I would have given this camera 5 stars, for its picture quality, but hard use and even poor practices can produce a problem.  My wife is hard on electronics, and she wouldn't wait (hesitate) when sliding the record, playback, movie selector switch, and in a year, it would not discriminate between the functions as if the logic circuit was screwed up.  So, couldn't slide it and feel the normal detentes between selections. The switch began to feel as if there were no individual selections, just a continuous slider.So, be warned if you don't use a patient, delicate touch when moving this switch by waiting at least a second for the logic circuit to load each function selected.If it is an inherent design flaw that will show up in so many uses, don't expect Sony to feel sorry or admit it.  In these cases, it is a 4-letter word, after all.$177 flat fee repair at its Repair Center. If the camera wasn't so good and worth it, usually in cases where the repair is half the original cost plus depreciation would make it wiser to not repair and just buy a new one.Problem is, this touchscreen model isn't made any longer so buy from existing stock while you can.", "Date": "August 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Can't find anything wrong with it yet.", "Author": "B.

I doubt I was unlucky and got a bad one, I can't believe a 10.1MP sony camera takes so poor pictures.

The camera has a smart look and my wife and I loved the interface. We had a DSC-F717 (fabulous camera, after it was recalled and then fixed) but needed something compact. The slide show feature is really fun, too.Problem: The N2 could not deliver in low light situations without a flash. I mean even on a moderately cloudy day outside. There are just too many situations like that when a better camera could catch the moment in its beautiful natural light. The images were blurry or soft, plain and simple. How can this be with the great optics and the megapixels? I am no expert but would guess that they are massively screwing up in the sensor-software department. I vote for less pixels and more attention to sensors and software. I mean, who uses a point and shoot and *really* needs more than about 8 megapixels for 99% of their photos? No one.Am still looking for a great point-and-shoot for low light camera. Will try the Fuji F31fd -- like the Sony F717, a legend.

For quick snapshot photographs, the quality, color, and sharpness rivals what comes out of my Canon 300D SLR.While most of you are looking for a great still camera, which this is, you will be pleased with the video quality that comes out of this thing.  Full frame 30 frames per second video.  It only takes a second or two to start up and you can record about 20-30 minutes or so on a 2 gig card.  It won't rival the latest high def cameras but it certainly can compare against a standard def camcorder.  Transferring to YouTube or editing is a snap with a format conversion (Mac users - look at Visualhub for this).Battery life is decent.  Video obviously consumes more power than taking stills.No product is perfect and of course there are a few gotchyas:1. First, the interface can get a little clunky and confusing.  I suggest spending an afternoon with the manual and playing with its multitude of features.2. There's a sizable gap between the camera body and the screen where dust will collect.3.  You need to use a Sony's proprietary Memorystick card.4.  You can't zoom while taking a video.

The battery pack lasts twice as long as my old camera, and the Sony charger is fast, (I also purchased a back up battery pack).  As many others have said, the pictures are sharp and clear not sure if I will always need it set on 10 megapixels. The camera only comes with 25 megapixel internal memory, so you will need at least a 1 Gig memory stick.  I love the large touch screen, the menues are easy to use, better than a joystick and buttons.  I was looking for camera with at least 5x optical zoom, but after a week of using this great camera with so much clarity, you just crop the photo later on the computer.  I am sure Sony will add image stabilization to their next model when it goes beyond 3x zoom.The Sony software was nicely done, and great for viewing pictures by date or title.  Much better software than Kodak, (which takes over all your pictures, and hides your photo folder so that you use their developing service), nice job Sony.  I also like the slideshow on the camera, wow, fancy music, fades, etc, your friends will be impressed.Only small gripe I have is that the beep sound is annoying with every button and setting, and when you turn the beep off, it also turns off the shutter beep, so I can't tell if the picture took.

I loved the rechargable batteries. Depending on how long I was going to be gone, I either charged up both batteries or just one.  If I was gone just for 3 or 4 days, the one battery would be enough.  I hate to admit that I dropped the camera several times and it still worked fine.  I'm not sure if you can wear a camera out but the two years I was overseas, I think that this camera has seen enough and has outlast its purpose.

I took some pictures at a convention this passed November and they were just okay. None of them were consistant;had some good, some blurry and some didn't come out at all.

This camera provides crisp pictures in most lighting and manageable pictures in low lighting. It is quick and responsive. It takes great macro photos. With the underwater case, it can survive almost anything. It plays slideshows which you can add mp3 music to. However, this camera's real excellence is in its durability.

It has survived heat, cold, moisture, and an incredible amount of general abuse.

So if you are taking photos to get a wide look at scenery or anything else, you won't get it.3. Megapixel count.  The way it is 10.1 MP is by having that in a non 4x6 mode.

Some other Sony cameras (and competitors) allow you to zoom while taking video.  I was disappointed that this didn't work on a new model.The touch-screen was mostly fine but I had one major complaint.  When reviewing pictures one at a time, there were two big huge 'next' and 'previous' arrow buttons on the lower portion of the screen (with a 'play' button in the middle if it was a video).  These buttons obscured a noticable portion of each image on the touch-screen.  There should be a mode where the buttons are invisible--touch on the right half of the screen to goto the next picture, left half to go back.  This was not the case, however, and the large buttons seriously reduced the satisfaction of the otherwise nice screen.  You could toggle the touch screen on and off but this gets very annoying when scanning through several pictures--(on, next, off, on, next, off, etc.)  It would have been so simple to make it smarter and look better but they failed to do it.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excelente c\u00e1mara", "Author": "Joel Morera Pascual", "ReviewID": "R2FPG6QREZVK0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Incre\u00edble!!!

Bad idea.The camera came and upon first inspection we were happy.  I took a few pictures with it.  I wasn't blown away but they were okay.  I admit I was a little bummed because they were not as nice as the Canon pictures but they were good enough.  So I would have been happy.  I had to add that red eye was a bit of a problem...but that can be edited out.Then the battery needed to be charged.  Now this was really not impressive because it didn't take much for the battery to need charging.  Of course I'm comparing this with my Canon that I rarely charged.  But again I thought I could deal with this.So I charge the battery.  I put it in the camera all ready to take pictures and the battery isn't charged.  I put the battery in the charger, light goes on, stays on and then goes off.  The battery won't charge.  Grrrr..I contact Sony.  I am instructed that I should ship my camera and charger (at my cost) to Sony and in a few weeks they will send it back.  So I'm to pay to send my brand new, yet broken camera, back to Sony and be without it for weeks.  Not okay.  My husband calls.  He tells them he believes it must just be the charger, and the hubby is a techie type, and he would like them to send a new charger.  My husband offered to give his credit card number to cover the cost of the charger and suggested that when the broken charger came back they could then credit him the amount.  Everyone wins in this case.  Well after over an hour on the phone, most of it spent on hold and the rest of the time with rude employees, my husband hung up and had not resolved the issue.So what happened?  The camera went back in the box and was returned.We have since purchased a Canon PowerShot SD900 Digital Elph.  I have not used it yet but I am very excited.  The bottom line is Cannon cameras have a wonderful reputation and this camera had more to offer with little price difference.  We feel this was probably a blessing in disguise that we didn't keep the Sony because there is talk of financial problems at Sony and some speculate that they may end up out of business.I do not recommend this camera.
