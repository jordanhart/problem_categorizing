Received it about a week before the trip, and started playing with it.  It has some nice features, and I like the zoom and image stabilization.  The screen is great, and pictures for the most part are wonderful.  Battery life does seem shorter than advertised.  We only got around 200 pictures out of it per battery charge so far, but my wife does like to review the pictures repeatedly, so if she wasn't doing that maybe it would last longer, who knows.  The other thing my wife doesn't like is that it is sometimes a little slow to take a picture and there's no mode for taking multiple pictures in succession.  She's used to her DSLR's so we can't ding this camera for that.  All in all we're happy with our purchase of the Casio Exilim EX-Z2000Edit: So since I wrote this review, we had an issue with the charger, which Casio fixed for free, but then after just over a year of use (14 months exactly), the camera is now dead.  It was working fine for most of a day at a County Fair, then after a shot, it went completely unresponsive.  The lens is locked in the out position, battery fully charged, but nothing will make it do anything.  Just a few months after the warranty expired too.  Thumbs down to Casio.  You're supposed to make a camera that lasts, not something that completely goes belly up after 14 months of use.  It also developed a pixel that always saved as blue on the image, which had to be corrected on every photo.  Was a nice camera while it worked. Changed from 5 to 3 stars.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Casio EX-Z2000 14.1 MP digital camera", "Author": "RJP", "ReviewID": "R1UD1YW7GOAFPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a dedicated photographer and just wanted a light camera good to take simple pictures of family gatherings and the occasional landscape view. In choosing the Casio digital camera I just followed a recent Consumers Report article and ratings.  Although this Casio model was not at the very top of its class it was close enough to the top and a best buy.  It delivers good quality pictures, has good stabilization, and can take more pictures from a charged battery than similar models (good feature if you travel abroad), all for a very good price.  A moment of frustration arrived early when unpacking: the software and instructions of the accompanying CD were for PCs only and I own a Mac.  But a phone call to Casio solved all problems quickly: using Mac software you can cope with all that is needed for loading your pictures into your hard disk, looking at them and doing most things I would normally do with them.  I am satisfied with the picture quality, and after some study, with the handling of the different functions although at first I missed my previous Canon cameras which maybe more intuitive.  In summary, I recommend this camera highly.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "T. Sen \"Ted\"", "ReviewID": "RJ040UXRPKFS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera before I went to Vegas. First of all, you can take pictures day or night; it gives the same sharp pictures regardless. It has 3200 ASA sensitivity makes the camera comparable to some of SLRs. It has 5X Ultra Wide Angle Zoom which makes a great deal for a regular user. Also, 3\" LCD is bigger than many cameras in the same class and shows the pictures in extreme detail and clarity. You can record videos almost as same as a video camera, no need an extra bag for a video camera. It has multiple color filters which you can use to create some fantastic shots. It is thin comparing to other cameras. Casio kept its historical thinness in EX series including this one. Battery is more than enough to use for at least 400 shots and may be more. I took couple videos at the same time. Only thing advisable, use it with minimum 8GB SDHC memory card. I used it with premium processing option to take pictures, it is taking little longer to process the picture but gives better quality and camera automatically recognize whether you are taking night shot or scene or portrait etc. For the money I spent to this camera, it is all worth it.

I was very impressed when I received it at the features that it had as well as the ease of use.  I took it on a week long trip with me and loved it.  The battery lasted the entire week without even dropping below the 75% mark.  I was very excited about my purchase.Then came the disapponitment.  When I got home I plugged the camera into the TV to review the photos with my family only to discover that over half of the photos were out of focus.  I was very upset that I had done something wrong.  Over the next several days I tried different settings on the camera to see if I could get it to regularly take photos that were in focus.  Basically I was unable to do so.  I couldnt find a pattern as to why it would focus vs not focus.I ended up returning the camera and start my search for a new one.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "K.

Han", "ReviewID": "R1Z112DQ4XRCC9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a little hands on studies before trying to choose between Casio Z2000 and SONY W350 (comparable in both price and specs). Physically Z2000 is a little bigger and heavier. However, it gives more solid feel while holding in one hand. Besides the metal finish looks better than W350.I like Z2000 operating buttons layout a lot, particularly zoom in/out. Easily to operate with one hand only, . W350's buttons are too small and too close to each other.In term of special feature, W350's Panorama shot is very useful. Z2000 has many useful bestshot modes, but may take a couple seconds or so before the next shot.Overall, I like Z2000 a lot for its look and operation. It's also a great camera for picture quality under normal lighting condition.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Casio EX-Z2000", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R1GCPVGECAPUPT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is the third Casio camera I have purchased and the first one to disappoint me.  I have not been able to take good pictures since I purchased the camera.  The pictures are often out of focus.  What is worse is that the colors are all off.  Any pictures taken at night under artificial lighting results in the light producing a yellow tint on all objects around it.  I have sent the camera back to casio for repair and I received what they call a \"reconditioned\" camera in exchange.  This reconditioned camera appears to have the same problem.  The problem became very evident when I took the same pictures with both my old Casio, a EX-S770, and the new one.  The pictures taken with the EX-S770 were far superior in terms of colors vs. the pictures taken with the EX-Z2000.  I bought the new casio since I thought it would be superior to the old one.  It definitely is not.  I am going to send it back to Casio for further repair.  If they cannot improve it I will just have to junk it.

I owned a different Casio EX and hoped this model would be similar. I can't say I liked this camera at all. The usual good features and small size were there, but the quality of the images in anything less than perfect natural light were garbage and totally grainy! Using the flash didn't fix the problem.

At first, I got great results - and this camera proved to be noticeably better in low light than my wife's Canon's.Then the wheels fell off. After nothing but the most pampered treatment, one day I got the dreaded Lens Error 2 message. I'll save you all of the sad detail, but after three tries the Casio repair center still couldn't fix the problem - lens replaced, etc. all to no avail. The camera was never dropped, banged, bumped, bruised or subjected to anything except gentle handling.I explained to Casio Customer Service that I couldn't understand why a camera used so gently and infrequently could be inoperable almost right out of the box. They offered to replace it at no cost, offering several cameras of lower quality and fewer features - why would I do that?  And I got the distinct impression that I was not the first person to call them with this same problem.All in all, a huge disappointment. I will NEVER again buy a Casio camera and I can only caution anyone reading this to consider carefully spending any money on one. As I mentioned, all the research I did went for nothing - I got a lemon and Casio wouldn't do anything to effectively address the problem. Their warranty is worthless if they can't/won't fix the problem.Caveat Emptor.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent point-and-shoot style camera", "Author": "J. M. Ramm", "ReviewID": "RNRBH6LN8ZU48", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 18 months, and I like it. Here's a breakdown of what I've found so far:Pros:* Simple interface, easy to use* You can plug it into your computer over USB with a wire that comes with it. It can act as a mass storage device, so it works just like a USB key. No firmware! Very handy for Linux users!* Pretty good picture quality, I've found. I don't really use cameras all that much, but it seems fine for just taking quick snaps.Cons:* It's got so many useless presets! It's got a preset for taking photos for ebay?* It doesn't have a few very useful presets! Like the stitch preset on some cameras, so you can take panoramas.* When viewing pictures, and you zoom out, this can be really slow. It's quite cool that you can look at them by date, but the slowness just makes it annoying.Overall, quite a nice camera for taking quick snaps.

Ruggiero", "ReviewID": "RDP5ITKS5H44D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is not a review just yet as I have a question for all who currently own this camera...I've owned the Casio EX-Z2000 for the last three months (a summer loaded with photo opportunities!) and I've noticed that it seems to take an awfully looong time just turning on. I'd say an abnormally long time compared with previous digital cameras I've owned. I'd say about a good solid 5-10 seconds, which by that time I've lost the shots I was hoping to capture. There has to be an explanation for this. I hate to have to return this camera (if I even can) since I really like it but this has become an increasingly annoying & aggravating problem for me.Has anybody else had the same problem with a \"delayed\" time that it takes for the Casio EX-Z2000 to turn on or is it just me? If so, what have you done - if anything - to successfully remedy this problem?Appreciate any and all feedback.Thanks,~RobertP.S.

Guys, there is a reason they don't sell them in stores any longer. They probably had so many complaints about these cameras they decided to discontinue.

So I painted the side of the USB cable that faces the back of the camera and instructed the users to put the white painted side toward the camera back. Problem resolved.  The design flaw, though, is that this USB cable fits into the camera in either direction -- the correct way or the incorrect upside-down way.
