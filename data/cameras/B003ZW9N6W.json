After getting them set up and installed, I noticed that the audio on two of the three cameras was frustratingly bad.  Upon close inspection of the three cameras I realized that while the packaging for all three cameras indicated the same exact camera, two of the cameras had different model numbers on the internal labeling.The good camera had model number: CAM-CM01-245AThe two bad cameras had model number: CAM-CM01-245ATIt seems to me that they changed something about the camera (especially related to sound quality) and have the old and new cameras on the market marketed under the same model numbers.  If you're lucky enough to get the good one, it's a great entry level security camera.  If you get the other one, don't count on the audio.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Troubled Neighbor", "Author": "Mama", "ReviewID": "RGO2Z7SG6216R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a Night Owl Security Camera because I have problems with my neighbor threatening my dog.  I connected the camera to an old tv & VCR so I could record what was going on.  I live in denver and shortly after I installed the camera we had a major snow storm, 18 inches of snow and temperatures got down to 15 degrees.  The camera never missed a beat!

Farley", "ReviewID": "RRRYLWFIDPS94", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The cameras are ok, bought 3 of them, but the cables included are fragile.  Closed one in the front door and it broke connection and our front door is not sealed very well.  Needed to amend this review.  The picture has gone out on one camera within a month of installation.  The camera is protected, under a roof and two walls shielding it.  That isn't the bad part though.  The company gives you the royal run around trying to get an RMA.  They think that a screen shot that has had snipit used to shrink it for email is a \"text/editable receipt\".  Five emails to date so just plan on eating the expense of the camera and go with a more reputable brand even if it cost more.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Night Owl Cameras", "Author": "luis Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R2ZXU0FUIVTA4Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased two Night Owl Cameras for my system since they were less expensive through Amazon than the manufacturer.I returned the first one due to being defective (no video signal), they sent me a replacement one in late August. It worked for two days and now it is no showing signal again. What do I do, return it again?????Same exact thing happened with the second camera, it worked for two weeks and now it is showing same icon \"no video signal\"??? I again, requested a replacement on the second one and replacement arrived today.Now, I am the point of having purchased two cameras, both have been return for replacement. One have been received and it is not working again and the second replacement arrived today to replace second camera.Are these defective products being sold? I have purchased many items through Amazon, but this experience, it is just totally unacceptable. Stop selling these items or advise manufacturer. Please advise what to do with first camera replaced in late August,  that has been replace already once and it is not working again??????????????To top it off, I ordered a cell phone battery and it also arrived defective.

These work very well with proper lighting for the area (night time viewing can be hard to see if there is no enough light for the camera to get a good view) I installed a motion sensor light in the same area and have nothing negative to say about this product.Easy to install by yourself; no professionals needed.

Snow blew on it and it still worked great. I attached it to something portable so I could bring it inside. I do not recommend it is left outside in the winter if the temperature gets way below zero and there is a wind chill. Works best in the dark in the winter when there is snow cover, as the snow makes the night vision light up more. I have yet to use this in the spring and summer. If you want this video camera in the winter and the winters get quite harsh like here(western New York), I recommend you attach it to something portable, so it can be brought inside. I sat it on my porch railing and ran the video line through my porch window, underneath the sliding storm window and into the living room.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "mrd", "Author": "mrd", "ReviewID": "R18XF497SK5PGV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased 4 cameras last November and finally I install them.

Strange anomalies aside with random cameras and DVR's, I have had six cameras for over 4 years running flawlessly with one exception. One half of the IR field on one camera has failed, leaving me to move that one to a more naturally lit area to compensate for the lack of night vision distance. Still a pretty good track record, and I am never disappointed with my Night Owl purchases. I am adding more cameras with wide field vision and better color, but these function just fine.
