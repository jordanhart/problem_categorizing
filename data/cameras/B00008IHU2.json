I was moving from a very good 35mm Nikon SLR and so had a solid set of expectations.  My criteria for a camera were- compactness (a major gripe against my SLR)- ample zoom to campture kids' candid moments without intruding- unlimited movie capability - with sound- support for \"normal\" (read: AA) batteries- Support for external flash- accurate color reproduction- Cost ($300 - $400)On all these counts, the C-750 is a winner.  I did not really need the 4MPixel capability and was actually leaning toward the Fuji S5000.  However, picture quality and manual configurability tipped the scales towards this slightly more expensive camera.Although the factory presets will work fine in most situations, I would recommend taking the time to familiarize yourself with its features (on the extensive manual).  Even without the gadgetry of a professional photographer you can easily compensate for unwanted artifacts (such as shadows) or poor color reproduction due to lighting.There is a perceptible shutter-lag: The time between pressing the shutter trigger and the actual picture being taken; you can however, minimize this by pressing the trigger down half-way to compose you picture.  Where I can see this being a problem would be if you are trying to capture those fleeting \"Kodak momemnts\".The charger that ships with the camera takes a good 8-9 hours to charge 4 batteries.  I would recommend that you purchase a smart-charging NiMH battery charger -- these are faster to charge and have auto shut-off features.In comparing cameras based on movie capability make sure that the only limit is the memory capacity -- there are some (not the C-750) that impose a time limit.Finally, if you are like me and this is your first foray into the digital world your expenses don't end with the camera: as I mentioned you need a good charger, a spare set of NiMH batteries,  a good carrying case, maybe an upgrade from the photographic software that ships with the camera....", "Date": "December 22, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer \". . .\"", "ReviewID": "R1T6QGLX1YUJ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera and I am very pleased with the quality of the camera and the pictures.  I reviewed several digital cameras and finally decided on the C750 because of Olympus' reputation for quality lens and clear pictures.  The results did not disappoint.  The 10x zoom is a nice \"bonus\" feature not commonly found on digital cameras.This camera comes ready to shoot straight out of the box in auto mode and yet has many manual features for those who prefer greater control.  As an amateur photographer, the manual feature is a great way for me to learn without having to wait to see how the pictures will come out.There are several negatives, but mostly minor ones.  The C750 is a bit heavy for its size.  The camera does not come with a carrying bag and because of its size, the bags that Amazon recommends are too small.  The lens cover is not automatic, it has to be manually removed prior to taking pictures.  The view screen freezes briefly when a picture is taken, which makes it difficult to follow the subject in an action shot.  Olympus uses the xD picture card which is more expensive than other memory cards.  Finally, the C750 does not have image stablization so a tripod is needed for clear zoom shots.Overall, the Olympus C750 is a very well built camera that takes great pictures and is one of the best value/quality digital camera in the 4MP class.", "Date": "October 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera with a couple concerns", "Author": "\"mrsafetyprofessional\"", "ReviewID": "R2UC4RGQSIV1H5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was comtemplating on waiting for the Canon Powershot A80 but really wanted the 10x zoom so i went ahead and bought the Olympus C-750 instead. The main reason i bought it was the zoom and its usage of AA batteries. I also bought a 512mb xD card by Fuji which works great and holds somewhere around 180 pics at top rez. I dont really use the Camedia software but instead use ACDSee v6 which I am more familiar with, and didnt want to learn new software. I think i will be buying a help guide to learn how to use all the manual features in this cam, as there are many. The digital view finder is nice as long as its not a very dark environment (I have been told that an optical viewfinder on a 10x zoom is not feasible and would result in a very expensive camera). The only things I wish could be different would be the inclusion of a printed reference manual, and if there gonna make this camera only use the expensive xD memory they should at least make it so panoramic mode would be accessible on third party xD memory (if you want to use the panoramic you have to buy \"Olympus\" brand xD memory). Olympus also wants you to send em more money to upgrade their bundled Camedia software to \"pro\" which is pretty shady in my opinion. If they would bundle the \"Pro\" version of the software, and take the restriction off the third party xD memory, this camera would easy get 5 stars.", "Date": "October 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "Zoom zoom zoom", "Author": "\"iwluttdid\"", "ReviewID": "R2533UIYFYVFHJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had this camera for a few days before I switched to the c5050. The zoom is amazing on this camera. And Oly gave this (and the c740) their new ED lens, which cuts down on purple fringing a great deal. I could definitely see the benefits of the ED lens.The picture quality is a little lacking compared to the c5050, but it makes up for this with the 10x zoom and the great battery life. The 10x zoom is awesome. I took some pics at a concert sitting way back zoomed all the way in, hand held..and the pics came out great. It also takes amazing macro shots.I also like the fact that it uses AA batteries and not proprietary ones like some other brands. But you want to make sure to get a nice charger. I use a charger that charges in 3 hours and is smart enough to condition the batteries and doesn't overcharge the batteries. The charger is called maha or something close to that. The charger that comes with the unit will take a whole day and you probably won't want to leave your batteries in there for too long if it's fully charged.This camera will be great for simply pointing and shooting, and it'll allow you room to grow when you can finally utilize the plethora of manual options.Here is why it gets 4 stars and not 5:1. It uses the XD card, which, at the time of this review, is more expensive than the commonly used CF and SM cards.2. If you want to take panorama shots, you HAVE to buy an Olympus XD card.3. It doesn't function too well in low light conditions (in-doors)But the 10x zoom really makes up for all this. I got the c5050 and I really miss the zoom of the c750 :) Very compact too.", "Date": "July 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "The Best 700 Series Yet!", "Author": "Rheumor", "ReviewID": "R2QU14F8E2A8EQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The long awaited Olympus 750 is the latest in a line of excellent relatively compact, long lens models. The last model, the 740, was a stop-gap measure that allowed the company to position a new model in the line while they worked out the kinks in the 750's updated autofocus system. The result was worth waiting for, as a much faster system now exists that allows the camera to take better advantage of low light and fast action scenes.In addition, the 750 addresses another of the 740's drawbacks, the lack of sound on the occasionally very useful movie feature has been fixed. Many users will also be pleased to note that finally they have upped the maximum resolution from 3 to 4 megs.Still troublesome however is the lack of stabilization, making long range zoom shots very tricky. In point of fact, zooming on any camera at 10X without a tripod or image stabilization is extremely challenging.Anyway, this camera is beautifully made and ergonomically engineered. The aspherical all glass lens system is excellent and the resulting 4 megapixel images are crystal clear at 11\" x 14\" and beyond. The zoom of course remains the trump card on the 750, and the smoothness (just the right damping) with which it reaches its 10x limit is awesome.The 750 (a feature that began with the 730) is the third Olympus to utilize the new xD memory card format, the \"xD-Picture Card\". This is a new type of ultra-compact memory media developed jointly by Fuji and Olympus. The main features of the xD-Picture Card are its ultra-compact size (20.0 x 25.0 x 1.7mm), its lower power consumption (the xD Picture-Card users will benefit from the convenience and savings of longer battery life on a single charge) and its faster read/write speeds. Of course, a new card means a new card-reader will be needed, but these are inexpensive and aren't immediately needed, as the camera can be linked by the included USB cable to your PC without too much fuss.Overall, I think the 750 is the Olympus most users have been waiting for, sans stabilization. Whether that system (present on my Olympus 2100 & far from perfect) is in the works on a 760 model I cannot say, but if you're in the market for a relatively compact digicam with a very long zoom, you can hardly go wrong with any of the 700 series by Olympus.", "Date": "September 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "C750UZ Rocks!", "Author": "Ozgard \"Oz\"", "ReviewID": "RIQJA9S9HR25F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After months of research I finally settled on Olympus as the manufacturer.

It was the Best digital camera $500 or more and was even better than the 5 Megapixels compared to it. Easy to use and even better- terrific pictures. Set the mode to Auto and take your pictures its as easy as that or for the more adventurous there are manual settings to muck with. The one insignificant problem that I had was with the manual. It comes on CD and you need Adobe Acrobat to read it. Other than that it was a wise choice. I am extremely happy with this camera, it ROCKS! Advice - get either a 128mb or 256mb xDcard.

I love it.  My first digital camera was Kodak dx4330.  I was glad that I had the kodak one as my first digital camera because it was very user-friendly and easy to use.  But I wanted to have more advanced features, such as A/S/M control, white balance, macro mode, exposure compensation. This Olympus camera offers lots of features I was looking for.I must say that if you're a beginner photographer or new to the digital camera, this camera might be too complicated and not user-friendly.  However, for those looking for cameras with advanced features, such as various manual setups and ultra zoom, this is a great camera for a reasonable price range.When I tried to use the Movie mode with Sound (this model has an option of having Sound on or off with Movie mode), there was a constant mechanical grinding noise by the microphone and whenever I recorded the movie, it would record that annoying noise too.  I called the technical support at Olympus.  The person I talked to told me that that was \"normal\" for their digital cameras.  He could not offer any solutions to get rid of that noise.  I was so disappointed about this fault.  However, yesterday when I was trying different modes and options on this camera, I discovered that turning off \"FULLTIME AF\" option from Movie Mode Menu gets rid of that noise.  \"FULLTIME AF\" mode is offered in both Still Camera mode as well as in Movie mode.  In order not to have the grining noise recorded in your movie, you need to turn off \"FULLTIME AF\" from the Movie Mode menu option.", "Date": "February 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Best value for the price", "Author": "Tibor", "ReviewID": "R8XS4OGQJMH96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I have been using this camera for about 5 months, and we're overall very happy with it. It has rich functionality, and excellent picture quality, not to mention the awesome 10x zoom.Before our purchase, I was reading lots of reviews and viewing lots of sample pictures on the net. While --as other other reviewers have pointed out-- some artifacts may be present in extreme settings, most of these will only prevent you from taking truly professional shots. (However, if you're looking for a camera that exhibits much less artifacts, you'll need to look into a price range maybe an order of magnitude higher.) So since I definitely wanted a large zoom (you really need that if you aim at doing creative things), this camera seemed like an excellent value, with lots of nice features and really few problems.We've made several thousand pictures already, and we really fell in love with the camera. It gives you amazingly real colors, excellent picture quality, and tremendous flexibility for your creativity. After showing it to a friend, he bought his own in a few days.Talking about some other cons that other reviewers mentioned:- small memory card: all cameras I know of come with small memory cards. This is just the way it is. (Probably because memory is expensive and many people just forget about it, making them willing to buy more expensive cameras.) Also, while the xD cards are slightly more expensive than most others, it's a one-time investment, and they are fast.- poor charger, relatively short battery life: This is true but not really an influential factor. Just go and buy an Energizer 8-pack of 2100mAh batteries with charger for about $25, and then you have 12 batteries and 2 slow chargers, which I guarantee will be enough, and you don't need to buy the expensive fast charger.- poor autofocus in dark: This is also true, but even AF assist lamps don't help at more than a few feet distance, so don't feel you're really missing out on that, except if you want lots of short-distance point-and-shoot shots in dark. Otherwise, to take shots in dark, you can buy a tripod (cheap) and use rich array of manual settings, which is what you'd do with any good camera. We've made lots of excellent night shots, even with full auto settings, using only a tripod.So my recommendation: check the specs, and if it doesn't lack something you definitely need, then buy.", "Date": "February 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2QSQHPOO74MCW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is just simply amazing. Whether you are new to photography, or are an avid photographer, this camera will fit all. The auto mode lets this camera operate as a simple point and shoot camera, while the multitude of manual adjustments offer a great deal of flexibility in shot selection. The pictures that I have taken thus far have been of very good quality. I can't wait to see what they look like once they are printed out on a decent printer.This camera comes with 4 rechargeable NIMH batteries and a charger, Camedia 4.1 software, remote control, and of course users manual and cables. I love being able to view my pictures on a tv with the included A/V cables. The remote control is also very nice if you take a lot of self portrait shots or group photos. I haven't used the included rechargeable batteries yet, but they are only 1700MA.The zoom of this camera is great. The optical zoom is a whopping 10X, but you can also use the digital zoom to get as close as 40X... and the quality is actually pretty good for that much digital scaling. The 4X digital zoom is available while taking pictures in any resolution!! My previous camera was a Finepix 3800, and I hated the variable digital zoom.Some of the manual settings include aperture control, shutter control, white balance, saturation, contrast, focus....etc.  This camera has been able to do anything that I want and then some.As of this writing, I have absolutely no regrets about buying this camera.

I am kind of annoyed that there isn't more warning of low batteries. Twice I have had it die right in the middle of a photo (one of the photos can't be replaced) and good luck getting the lens to retract when the batteries die. Another problem is the purpling effect in some photos. One example is a shot taken up the trunk of a tree through a canopy of leaves, the purple effect was very apparent. This was done at F3.2. I tried again at F4.5 and it was better but probably would have still been obvious on a print. I also have a Canon G2 and tried the same shot and it did fine. I have even noticed purple on well exposed photos in sunny day scenes. The camera also just shut off once for no apparent reason. On the upside the pictures are good overall. The 10x zoom lens makes clear pictures. The camera seems to be built well and seems like one that would last. You also have the option of TIFF format, although this is kind of a laugh with a 16MB memory card.  The software with the camera is not bad. I do remember my computer locking up a few times in the \"Browse Images\" selection. I would probably give this camera 3 1/2 stars overall.

I mostly use it for photography on hikes and field trips, so have found it to be useful for both macro pics of insects and distant photos of giraffes, and pretty much everything in between.  It seems to be pretty robust (i gave it a knock in the hills the other day which was equivalent to one which completely disabled my girlfriend's finepix a few months ago), and I have been really pleased with the battery life on 1700mA AA batteries... I can basically fill up my 500MB of cards on 2 battery changes.  On the down side, the camera doesn't focus very well in low light, and the manual focus is obscure and hard to use. The standard macro function is pretty average, but is made up for by the superb \"super-macro\" (with a fixed lens zoom).  As someone making a transition to digital photography from using a mid-range SLR, I find it frustrating that most of the mode dial is taken up with 'idiot' settings ('action' 'landscape' 'people with mountains placed on heads'(?)) that frankly I never use, while Manual, Aperture Priority and Shutter Speed priority all languish under the one mode, and have to be altered by going through menus (which is not too much of a drama, since the menu system is pretty good, and you can programme the 'my mode' mode to do wat you'd like).  The eyepiece is a minute LCD, which bothered me when ordering the camera, but the quality of the wee screen is superb, and a significant improvement on the first electronic viewfinders, which are pretty useless.  Reviews I had read complained about camera shake at high zooms, but I haven't had a problem with this - the camera will automatically select an ISO that is suitable for the task, and, well, that is what tripods are for.  Outside dawn, dusk and stormy days, I find that I can regularly shoot at high zoom with shutter speeds of 1/250 or faster, enough to eliminate any shake.All in all, I think that for simply taking photos this camera is is superb.", "Date": "January 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Dependable camera with one small problem", "Author": "jimj", "ReviewID": "RXDOEK1K4JKCR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about 10 months ago and have been using it since then. This is a great camera, especially with the 10X optical zoom. All my friends have been surprised with the brilliant pictures that can be taken with its full optical zoom. It's got a solid feel to it and is very well constructed - quite unlike the many plastic cameras in the market today. I had even dropped the camera once from my pocket onto a concrete floor while sitting on a bench - a 2 feet drop. There was just a scratch on the mode dial but no other issues - I don't think too many electronic devices can live after a fall like that.The one problem with the camera is low light focus (By low light I mean a standard size room with just one 60W bulb). It often fails to focus in such conditions especially in high zoom. The solution in low light could be:a) Take photos in full wide angleb) If that fails try switching to manual focus. Here you could first try keeping the focus fixed at infinity.But this is a problem with most 10X zoom cameras out there. I guess it's because of the large number of individual elements within the lens that reduce the light reaching the sensors. Due to this you may want to rethink buying this camera if you have to do a lot of photography in low light or you want a simple and uncomplicated point and shoot camera.I have read some people complaining about the shutter delay and how it's impossible to take pictures of moving subjects. The solution is quite simple - just hold the shutter button half pressed and then and shoot exactly when you want to. The only problem could be if the subject's distance from you is rapidly changing. Personally, I have never found problems taking action shots though.Pros:- Excellent array of features.

I have two kids under 4 years old and I knew digital cameras would have trouble with them b/c of their (the cameras, that is) slow shutter time relative to film SLRs, and based on what I'd seen using other people's digital cameras.  But I got the C-750 anyway.  I sent it back after a week.  The autofocus was unbearably slow, even when set in 'sports' mode, with or without flash.  The pictures were often either blurry or I missed the moment because of the slow speed of the camera.  A digital camera review web site I read ranked the C-750 as 'slower than average', and I would say that was also my impression comparing it to relatives/friends cameras.", "Date": "March 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera - beats my Nikon 35mm hands down", "Author": "Howard T.

I have pictures from half time performances at the Yale-Harvard game (taken from high up in the stadium with probably 7-8 power zoom) that I've easily blown up to 20\" x 30\"!  I've shot pics for many years with a Nikon 35mm SLR and I can't get close to the flexibility I get with this small digital.  The C-750 has an incredible number of features, which will take some time to master, though you can get excellent pictures right out of the box with intuitive controls.  I certainly would prefer a hard-copy complete manual, but if that's the only negative, I'm sold.  I had had an earlier digital, also from Olympus, and was not nearly as satisfied.  However, with the C-750, it was like Olympus read my mind, and added every feature that I wanted in a camera and made it an outstanding bargain!  It's an amazing camera, tiny, with built-in settings for nearly all picture taking needs, but still allows creative expression if you want that too.  Olympus has always been known for giving the customer what they want in a product, and this is no exception.  You'll have lots of fun with this one!  I am taking far more pictures than I've ever taken before and getting much better results!  This camera brings the digital world to life.  p.s. My camera came with rechargeable batteries and a charger so you won't need but a spare set of rechargeable batteries.

First one was a C2500L. I still use that camera. I got the C750 because I didn't wait long enough for Olympus to come out with the C2100 with the 10x zoom when I bought the C2500L. So I've wanted a 10x zoom camera for 4 years. The other reasons I went with the C750 is because the hot shoe for the camera is identical to that of the C2500L and it has movie mode with audio.While I haven't used the camera for more than a day, it is very small compared to the C2500L. The camera comes with a tether for the lens cap that I found convenient. It takes amazing pictures with vivid color reproduction. The flash does not wash out the picture like my C2500L does. Illumination is more consistent throughout the shot than the C2500L. I would have liked the view finder to be optical instead of digital. But I am not going to complain since it automatically adjusts the focus and contrast fairly well for framing the shot. You can use the LCD to frame the shot and for recording movies. Very convenient.Movie mode is pretty cool and can be done with or without audio. Pictures can also be taken with or without audio, though the wav file is separate from the picture file when you copy it to the computer. The camera will look like a regular drive to the computer. I use Windows XP. No software needed. Just plug and go. I don't use the Camedia software so I can't comment on that. You can record movies and take pictures all on the xD picture card.Unlike my C2500L, it only takes xD picture cards. Contrary to my initial impression, it can delete all the images from the card all at once, without formating the card. The xD picture cards are so small, I don't mind having three types of cards for two cameras. My C2500L takes SmartMedia and Compact Flash. And the xD card is less than half the size of the SmartMedia at about the same thickness.The charger that comes with the camera is slow. Said to take 9 hours to charge the batteries. It recommends unplugging the charger after the 9 hours even if the batteries are not fully charged. I haven't looked into that very much but I just unplugged it after ten non-continuous hours of charging and the batteries got very warm but the light didn't shut off. Olympus included 1700 mAH batteries. I'm using 2000 mAH batteries in this camera. I've purposely taken over 100 stills at night with the flash, over 100 stills during the day and four 181 second movies and viewed it many many times with audio and I'm still on the same 2000 mAh batteries on its first charge. Incredible.I haven't been able to figure out how to get the camera to do fill flash photography. Don't know if it can.The quick start guide is handy for those in a rush. The basic manual is useless. The reference manual is what most will need and it's on the CD or can be had from the Olympus website, which is where I got it. Unless you shut off All Reset, the camera will keep dumping some of your personal settings every time you power cycle it. That annoyed me because it kept setting the quality to HQ after I had set it to SHQ.This camera is awesome. It's got lots of features that I've not had a chance to explore. More modes than I am used to with my C2500L. I recommend getting the fitted case for it. It should have been included with the camera but this is America where you get nickel and dimed. And plan on getting a larger capacity xD card. 16 MB just won't cut it.Update: Fill flash can be done. It was quite easy with the flash mode button. There are two annoying things about this camera. First off, wherever the camera is pointed, it will try to focus so that you can see what you're pointing the camera at through the viewfinder or LCD. The camera does NOT allow you to change the zoom while it's trying to focus. It's a pain in low light conditions and you're trying to quickly change the zoom to take a picture of the moment. You'll miss it by miles.The other annoying thing is that if you have a dark subject against a plain background, the camera will refuse to focus for the shot. I'll take a black pistol and put it on my bed with light blue covers to take a picture of it. The camera would focus so that the pistol will show up in the viewfinder. But when I tried to take the shot, it won't focus. My C2500L focused no problem. If I put a printed black and white document under the pistol, the camera focused no problem. I ended up taking the pictures with my old digital camera with the external FL-40 flash. I find this camera has inferior focusing capabilities to my C2500L. The C750 has a hard time focusing on a brass door knob on a brown door. No such problem with my C2500L.

Gillespie", "ReviewID": "RX0OIYO3DV9UQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the 750 and I own a 730 and a 700.  All of  them are excellent cameras and offer great optics.  The 700 is still  one of  the only digital  cameras out there allowing an  ISO  of  800 with an optical 10x zoom.  The 730 accepts both the XD and the Smartmedia  cards  and the  750  offers  a 4 MP capacity.  I print 8x10  enlargements from all three  cameras and they look great.  With  regard to some issues  raised  by other reviewers:  the complete manual  is  included  on  the  Camedia software disk  in  PDF format--it is worth the effort to print it out  and read  it.  I have  shut off  all beeps and other noises on  all of  these  cameras  since I  cannot stand any noise--instructions  on how to  do  this  are in the  manual.  With regard  to  shutter  lag, I shoot a lot of hockey games  and I almost  always pre-focus  by holding  the  shutter halfway  down (using flash you see a  green dot in  the viewfinder) and then  finish depressing the shutter when the  picture  is  composed.  If  you  are  taking indoor  sporting events, I  heartily  recommend external flash (get  permission  first).  I use Olympus  FL-40s but with the correct cable you  can use  cheaper  flashes such  as the Vivitar  283.  Note: not all UZ models  allow external  flash--I  do not recommend  buying a  digital camera without the ability to  use external flash. Olympus pioneered the 10x optical zoom  on  a consumer  digital camera and they are great lenses.", "Date": "July 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "What no super bright lense ?", "Author": "Bob Feeser \"MillCrafters.com\"", "ReviewID": "R15G23QPUGZNEF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Olympus came out with the Super Bright 1.8 lense. Simply put, it is a larger opening, which lets in more light. When you increase the zoom, you restrict the aperture size, and let in less light. Consequently, you get slower shutter speeds, which requires a steady hand, and in the case of 10x zoom, a tripod. This Olympus C-750 comes with a 2.8 to 8.0, depending on the zoom level.  What we are missing here is that a significant portion of what most people use their digital cameras for, is interior shots. Conditions that would need a flash. Flash shots tend to be washed out with artificial light, let alone the battery drain.  I bought an Olympus C-2040 a couple of years ago, and it had the 1.8 lense. It is unbelievable. In an indoor shot, this thing sees light unavailable to the naked eye. (At least it seems that way) You can check the shot in the LCD, then take the picture, and what shows up as the final shot in the LCD is way brighter than the room, and the original viewfinder. So consequently, I turn off the flash, take interior shots using only the normal light of the room, and get shots that are nicely lit, warm natural skin tones, great battery life, and non blurry shots.  I remember years ago in my Nikon 35mm days. I had a 1.4 lense, which was a lot more glass than the standard lenses. The 1.2 had even more glass, it looked like an all glass lense, and was very expensive.  So what does all of this mean? Right now, Olympus is selling their C-5050, with the 1.8 lense as a clearance item. They replaced it with the C-5060, which once again, has a darker lense. I guess they figure people go for obvious numbers, like 4x or 10x in the zoom, instead of 3x like my C2040 or the C5050. Consumer reports rated my C-2040, and it's predecessor the C-2020 as their number one rated camera. They reported that the printed picture results were superior to even the 5 megapixels cameras, and the following year, to being equivalent in printed results to the 5's.  If you are doing outside, in brilliant sunlight action shots, then the 10x zoom is beneficial. But if you plan on taking the family photographs indoors, or interior room shots, then this is not the number one pick.  I am not an expert on the C-750, and it looks like a very nice camera. Nor am I into yeah this and boo that, they are both great cameras. Olympus makes nice gear. Personally I find the 3x zoom to be all I need. To think of giving up my super bright lense, for some additional zoom gives me the shivers.  I just thought I would shed some light on this model, in addition to the well deserved, 5 star reviews.

And, as she likes to carry it everywhere we go, I decided to take a look on the new models.  But there are features in the c-750 that I can't find in any other camera of its category.No other camera, even the newest from Olympus, has a remote control like the c-750.And there's no other in its category that has that awesome 10x optical zoom.The only two reasons I have to replace it are its big size and its small display.  And, of course, the complaint of my beloved wife.I would also like something with SD instead of XD, but that is not a big issue.I think I will end up buying another camera without selling my C-750.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great camera with excellent image quality, hard to replace", "Author": "A. Yu", "ReviewID": "R1W90GE6AVQAAH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had this since 2003, I agree with jemaerca's detail assessment. Owing to its size, I was looking for a smaller replacement camera and failed miserably. I purchased several Olympus and Canon for the size (w/bigger LCD) but all have terrible/noisy image quality. Currently still searching.I decided to write this because the C-750 produces pictures easily comparable to my wife's 2 other 8M+ digital SLRs with expansive add-on lens. She was amazed at C-750's image quality when she was testing/comparing her Canon EOS 30D + $1K+ lens. Although our family owns several digital cameras, the C-750 remains the one that takes the most pictures (indoor/outdoor, vacation,...) in our family today.It's too bad that Olympus does not extend this product line, its SP-550uz is bigger/heavier and we don't need another digital SLR. It would be ideal if the C-750 is half its size with a bigger LCD.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Paula Madsen \"paulawong\"", "ReviewID": "R3EHVUYPQLJFEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has been my best friend for a long time. :) I use it all the time.
