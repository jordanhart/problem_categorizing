{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Panasonic BL-C210A Network Camera", "Author": "Easy-G", "ReviewID": "RD4B7IF9LZOO3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this camera through one of Amazon's Gold Box Deals for $130. For the price, it's a great camera. This is my second Panasonic network camera. A few years ago I bought their BL-C1A model Panasonic Network Camera and Pet Cam (BLC1A). The BL-C210A is a much nicer camera. The picture image is several times better, especially when motion is involved. You have the option of pan and tilt to look around. You can disable the indicator lights on the camera that lets you know the camera is on. You can also disable or override the privacy mode button on top of the camera. You can configure the camera to email you a picture when it detects motion in your house. Now how's that for peace of mind while you're away? And my favorite is that the camera is powered through the network cable which eliminates the need for a power outlet near the camera. The camera has a threaded mounting hole in the back that can be used to mount the camera to a standard tripod or an optional wall mount. The cube design is nice because it allows you to just set the camera on a shelf or table. The camera is light, so a tug on the network cable can bring it crashing down if it's not secured.There are limitations with the camera. If you want to view an entire room, you'll need to mount the camera in a corner. It can only pan 41 degrees to the left or right, 10 degrees up and 32 degrees down. The camera is powered through the network cable, but it doesn't support the industry standard PoE. Luckily it comes with its own power injector. You'll need to purchase two network cables to use this camera. One cable connects the camera to the power injector and the other connects the power injector to your router/switch. The cable between the camera and power injector must be shorter than 98 feet. The box says you can only view still images from a cell phone. The website says you can't listen to audio with a cell phone.  I haven't tried either.  The software works pretty good, although I have found a few minor bugs in it. You have the option of viewing multiple cameras on one screen, but the max resolution for multiple cameras is only 320x240 and not the 640x480 max camera resolution. You don't need a computer onsite to use the camera, but you'll need one to do the initial setup.Panasonic has nicer cameras than this model, but the prices also get outrageous. $185 (current Amazon price) is not bad for one camera. But after you buy one, you'll want more so you can monitor the rest of the house. That's when $185 per camera starts adding up. If the price drops again, I'll definitely buy another.Note: The zoom function is not obvious. There are buttons on the screen to do everything but zoom. I discovered you can right-click on the top half of the video to zoom in and right-click on the lower half to zoom out. You can also use the wheel on your mouse to zoom in and out.Update (March 9, 2010): I did a little research on the camera model (BL-C111A) that the BL-C210A replaced.  This camera has a larger CMOS sensor but the same resolution.  The old model can pan 50 degrees to the left or right while this model can only pan 41 degrees.  The old model can tilt down 40 degrees while this model can only tilt down 32 degrees.  The old model had a 10x digital zoom while this model only has a 3x digital zoom.  The digital zoom is not very good.  If you have a need to zoom in on objects, you'll want a camera with an optical zoom.  Some new features added are SSL data encryption for secure viewing over the Internet, power through the network cable, H.264 video compression, and the ability to operate the camera with some models of Panasonic flat screen TV's.I bought another camera from Amazon to monitor the back door and kitchen area.  It comes with mounting holes on the back of the camera so you can slide it down on a couple of screw heads.  It frustrates me that you can't mount it flat on a wall and pan 90 degrees to the left and right.  I ended up purchasing mounting brackets VideoSecu Ceiling Mount Bracket for CCTV CCD Box Body Pro Camera 2-6 inch Adjustable MCB1w 1A2 so I can mount the cameras in a corner.  Again, I really like the ability to power this camera through the network cable.  I have the cameras and my network equipment all plugged into the same UPS.  This way I can still monitor my house in the event of a power failure.  If you're looking for a camera to monitor the baby's room, this is not it.  You can't see much with only a night light on in the room.  You're better off with a dedicated baby camera.  We've had good luck with a baby camera made by Astak Astak 2.4 GHz Pan & Tilt Baby Camera with 2.5\" LCD Color Handheld Monitor with Night Vision.  It can pan and tilt to see the whole room, can see very well in the dark even with no lights on, and comes with a handheld color monitor.  The monitor eats batteries so we just turn it on when we hear something or want to check up on the kids.  It also comes with an AC adaptor for continuous monitoring.  Another reason why a baby camera works better for monitoring babies than this camera is that you don't have to fire up your computer in the middle of the night to see if your child is awake.  A word of warning, many baby camera's operate on the same frequencies as your wireless network.  You might need to play around with the channels on both the baby camera and your wireless network until they don't interfere with each other.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Way To Monitor Your Burglar Alarm", "Author": "Stephen M. Prescott", "ReviewID": "RTRSY04KK0UP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A year or so ago, we installed an Ademco burglar alarm which we found we could not hook up to a monitoring service because we had dropped our landline. There are services that will monitor your alarm system through the cell phone network but they are expensive. So I decided to make a project out of this. I would find a way to monitor the alarm system with zero net monthly cash outlays. I spent idle hours wondering how I might cobble together some homemade piece of equipment that can capture the alarm signal off the Ademco and fire a programmable event on one of our computers through a USB port or something like that. Tricky stuff. Iffy.Then I discovered the fact that this ip camera (as well as many others) have e-mailing functionality. After a little research I bought a couple and they are now in service. I connected the bell circuit on my Ademco, through a relay switch, to one of the two open alarm circuits on the Panasonic and now whenever the Ademco sends an alarm, we receive an e-mail with an alarm message plus, as a bonus, a photo of what the camera is seeing at the time. When we get the e-mail, we can go online either with a computer or our cell phone and see what is going on in the house. If the situation merits, we can then call the police or we can ask the neighbor to peek over. This is intelligent alarm monitoring as opposed to the automated kind you get when your alarm system sends a signal to the monitoring station every time the system is tripped for whatever reason (I read that almost all reports sent to the police by these systems are false and are placed on low priority). I am going to document this system and send it to my insurance agent asking for a premium discount in line with the standard discount you get with automated monitoring. We have achieved our goal of a no-cost alarm notification system.Two very good features of this unit are that you do not have to have a running computer to make it work and it receives its power over the ethernet cable. As long as your run is less than 98 feet, you can snake cable through your walls to your heart's content without worrying about how you will power the camera.Since this camera has, in addition to its ability to take a signal from your burglar alarm, its own internal motion-heat-sound detectors, you could also use it as a sort of burglar alarm all by itself. But it does not have the capability to act as a perimeter alarm as would be the case if you have an alarm system with door and/or window sensors. And it does not turn on sirens to 1.) wake you up, 2.) scare the intruders away or 3.) if they are not scared away, heighten the level of insanity that is already going on in their minds.Like the others, I find that the camera does not perform well in low light. But I have several lamps in our home that are hooked up to X-10 switches. These X-10s are programmed through the burglar alarm to turn on when the alarm goes off. I have not tested them with the camera yet but I am hoping that they will provide enough light to let us see what is going on in the event of an alarm.There is one glaring vulnerability in all of this: your camera gives you notification and visual access through the internet; your house connects to the internet through a wire; burglars know how to snip a wire with a wire cutters and the more experienced burglars are going to do this before they attempt to break in. I circumvented this problem by changing my ISP. My new ISP connects the internet to my house wirelessly and that fixes that. If you do not have the wireless option, however, this issue needs to be addressed. Many alarm systems now can be fitted with an auxiliary backup device that calls you and/or the police through the cell phone network if your wire is cut. They cost extra both for the equipment and the ongoing use of the cell phone network.We got a lot of value for our money here. It proved to be an elegant solution to our problem and added many more features to boot. I love gadgets and my heart sings whenever I see it up in the corner of my living room ceiling with its lights blinking down on me. What other people might think is 'beyond the scope of this review'.ON PANASONIC SUPPORT: I'm not going to lower the rating on this camera because I think it is a fine product. But I will say that Panasonic support falls far short of the mark. In trying to get the camera viewable over the internet, I talked to 4 different representatives each of whom offered a different solution all of which were wrong. I wrote them a letter a week ago with no reply so far. So I did what I should have initially done which is to learn a little networking, specifically port forwarding. After my research and armed with some actual knowledge, I set up the cameras properly and they are now humming along. I can credit the reviewer who praised Panasonic support. However, that was not my experience. All these people had to do was to ask the right questions and then tell me what to do to configure the system properly. It took me, an amateur, a couple of hours to figure it out on my own and yet all four of these professionals failed to come up with the correct solution. And yes, I am fully aware that this is partly a result of a lack of committment on the part of management and not entirely the fault of the individual on the other end of the phone. 1-14-2011 UPDATE: Yesterday, I came across a puzzling issue having to do with sending sensor messages from the camera to our Panasonic Viera TV. Since I already know how good they are at fielding support requests over the telephone and through the postal service, I thought it might be interesting to send them an e-mail message via their website. The model of the camera was stated in the e-mail by way of the e-mail setup fields and I gave the model of the TV in the body of the e-mail. Later that day, I received this reply which I quote in full: 'Thank you for your inquiry. What is the model # to your cameras? If you have any additonal questions or concerns, please contact our technical support hotline at [...]. Thank you for choosing Panasonic.' Additional questions indeed.SETUP NOTE: If your network sits behind two in-line routers (one connected directly to the internet through the phone or cable TV wires, the 'outside' router; the other sitting between the outside router and the LAN: the 'inside' router) and you are having a hard time of it, identify both the public and private IP address of the inside router. Do a little googling to get yourself squared away on what the public and private IP addresses of a router are. Then, when you are setting up port forwarding on the outside router, you need to forward requests to the public not the private IP address of the inside router. Then use the private IP address of the inside router as the Default Gateway in your camera settings. There are other pitfalls but this particular one was my mine.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture on Internet Explorer - Difficult to set up on a Mac.  Horrible LOW light.", "Author": "M.

I absolutely do not recommend this or the 230a for a nursery!Review updated on 2-27-2010.  I will start by saying this was a very difficult to set-up camera on a Mac using Snow Leopard with VM Fusion and Parallels.  I was not able to get it to work on VM Fusion and Windows 7 and eventually switched to Parallels with Windows XP I finally got it to work.  I also have Trendnet TV-IP422W  which was simple to configure.Pro's1. Comparing the picture in bright light using Parallels, IE and H.264 the picture is AMAZING.  I will use the word 'Shocking' to describe how clear the picture is.  Compared to Trendnet it is laughable how clearer the Panasonic picture is.2. Web interface is great and is not limited for Mac users like Trendnet3. The P/T is Very quick and much quieter compared to Trendnet4. Unit size is very nice and the POE is well thought out.Con1.  Night 'vision' is completely worthless.  In the nursery with only a nightlight the TV-IP422W  switches to a b&w; view and we can see basic outlines, blanket vs child is a bit of a challenge.  However, turn on the night vision IR's and you can.  No switch to the panasonic setting next to the Trendnet, NOTHING.  When I say nothing I mean, you can't see anything just a black room.  No joke!2. The range of the P/T is very limited and I haven't figured out how to zoom.3. It appears H.264 compression improvements only work on IE and Windows.  You do not see a benefit with H.264 on FireFox or Mac browsers.4. I found it very difficult to setup on a Mac and feel free to leave comments if you are having trouble and I will see if I can help walk you through what I didI received a 4 pack of Synology surveillance License and it works great.  You can P/T and detection appears to work.  I'm using the latest beta firmware on a Synology DS 409.Final  Bright and I mean bright light the picture is amazing. Dusk the picture is not as good as the Trendnet and in very low light there is NO picture!  If you have the need for Low Light pass on this camera!  I also bought a 230a wireless and I used the same approach and was easy to set up and will put details in comment response.  I'm returning the 230a as it doesn't work in low light of a nursery.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "BL-210A IP camera review", "Author": "E. Lee", "ReviewID": "R2G7CP6WD8VNED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Has been playing with this network camera for 3 days and here's my opinions:1. Setup is easy. As long as your router support DHCP, it's just a matter of popping the setup CD and click on 'Camera discovery'.2. Good built-in software. I have another Panasonic BL-C111A network camera and both of them can show up in the same page.3. Need two ethernet cables separately: One goes to your switch and one goes to the camera. They both connect to a proprietary PoE injector.4. Tons of features: Motion trigger, Time trigger, Upload images to ftp, send images by email, remote access, etc.Let's talk about the image quality, as it's probably the thing most people are interested in learning. In short, if you need a camera for mission critical monitoring (business location, identify a thief, etc), this is probably not your camera. The sensor of this camera is only 1/4\" CMOS, which means it will be performing badly in low light situations. If you are looking for a camera for your business, then get a camera that have sensor size of at least 1/3\", those cameras cost at least $400 or more. However, for basic monitoring, or use it as a gadget, then I think it should be fine.Comparing my older BL-C111A and this camera, I came to the conclusion they perform almost identical, i.e. suck in lowlight, decent in bright light conditions. For the BL-C210A though, the overall image is sharper but it also gives a lot of 'mosquitoes' noise. My older BL-C111A has a softer image, but with a lot less noise. So it really depends on your preference, I find the 'mosquitoes' noise annoying, even though the image is sharper.Another thing is, they advertise this camera as 640x480 30fps capable. This is another one of those advertising gimmicks. The camera image looks the best when they are 320x240. In 640x480 mode, they just extrapolate or enlarge it from 320x240, hence, the noise is even more pronounced in 640x480 mode. You will not see any more details in 640x480 mode than you will in 320x240. But again, this is a $130 (or $180) camera, so this is to be expected. If you need more detail in your images, then consider a 1/3\" sensor camera.In conclusion, I think (just my IMHO) the image quality of this camera is no better or worse than generic Chinese made IP camera you can get on ebay (they all use 1/4\" CMOS sensor). However, Panasonic wins out in terms of support and the software features/quality. I would give this camera a 3.5 star for the image quality, and a 4 star for the value.", "Date": "February 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best you can get at this price", "Author": "Brian Gouge \"Gadget Freak\"", "ReviewID": "RBDKDJQXR6PU3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The MPEG-4 and H.264 are very clear (as clear as 640x480 can be). If you need more than 2 people to be able to watch it, you'll have to not use H.264. The MJPEG is quite a bandwidth hog on LAN, so if you expect to monitor this remotely you would best try to use the more efficient H.264 or at least MPEG-4.If it bothers you to have to switch resolution every time you open it, then set it the way you want it (640x480, etc), then create a favorite and/or desktop icon with the big long address box contents and it will open that way every time.The low light isn't spectacular but it's better than I get with my Logitech Pro 9000 webcam. It's better to see some things really grainy than to see nothing.The zoom is client-side, you can see when others move the camera but not when others use the mouse wheel to zoom in, it's not an optical zoom..The audio works great and there is a configuration for 3 microphone sensitivity levels. Programming the presets sent me to the manual but it's not hard once you see how to do it (the Program button above the presets, when logged in as admin).I have not, and will not, install any included software, so my review is limited to what you can do just accessing the camera via a web browser.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "BL-210a is a great little IP camera", "Author": "Sea Brat", "ReviewID": "RLX7ADYOFSDDT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The BL-210a worked easily out of the box on my home network.

I just recently remodeled a house in which I ran cat5e wires to every corner of the house.  I did not run any power lines out to the cat5e so I wanted some kind of POE (power over ethernet) camera.  I did run fishing line out with the cat 5e just in case I ended up using my old non-POE ip camera (Airlink SkyIPCam 250 and the 250W) so I could pull the power cords/jack through the wall with the fishing line, but I know I'm going to literally run into snags doing this and the line may break. We just stucco the house so getting the actual plug through the wall may be an issue down the line.I just saw the price drop from $180 to $155 on the C210a and saw a used one being sold my Amazon.  I took a chance and a leap of faith and bought a used BL-C210A (update: I also bought two new ones after this review).  I decided to go with wired connection because I've had issues with wireless ip cams before and if you read reviews of any wireless cameras, they _ALL_ have issues.  With a hardwired connection I will have eliminated the most problematic issues of wireless security cameras: video drop outs, connection drop outs, etc.Since I did some research on this camera I know it does not have good night vision - none at all.  And people have issues with setting this camera up on Macs and also setting up port forwarding.  I also know it does not come with ethernet cables.  So will I be disappointed?I got this camera last night and it looked almost brand new, but I can tell it was used.  The question for me? Will it work?  After going through the part list it seems like I got everything.  I scrambled to find two ethernet cables and I plugged one into my gigabit switch and the other end to the proprietary POE box.  I plug the other cable between the POE box and to the camera.  I hear some mechanical whirling noise as the camera centers itself, but I have no idea if I can view video.I stick in the setup disk, ran the setup program and searched for the camera.  It found it with ease.  I decided to upgrade the Firmware so I searched for it on the web, downloaded, and extracted it and used the setup program to upgrade the firmware.  That was easy.  I was wondering if I will run into a snag since most people run into issues setting up this camera.  I then had the setup program set up the networking and it told me how I can access the camera locally using my local ip address.  I want to set up port forwarding so I can access the camera on the internet so I register on the viewnetcam site and tried setting up the camera without ip4v and ip6v. I'm all set up, but of course port forwarding is not setup so I can't get to the camera from the internet.  I decided I should use ip4v to set up port forwarding.  I never used this, but it worked and I was able to get on the internet and view my camera! This was just too easy.  It might be because I'm in the tech field so setting up stuff on the router and devices on the network is relatively easy.  I have a Macbook pro, but I did not try to set up the camera on the mac, but I'm sure I can access the camera with Safari on the Mac.I tried accessing the my camera on my iphone and my Samsung Innov8 and they work great.  You can access the mobile version of the software by appending a \"/mobile\" to the end of the URL.My expectations were based on what the camera can and cannot do and I am completely satisified with the camera so I'm giving it a 5 star.  I would give it a 4 star if I expected night vision, but I already know it does not have night vision and the sales literature does not mention it.I like the fact this little unit buffers pictures so you can see action happening before the action starts.  With my skyIPcam, when action is detected, you will miss a few frames.  The pan and tilt is great and I will probably not get another camera without pan and tilt.  I did not test the zoom, but I heard it was digitial so expectations are low here.The included poe box is great so I don't have to buy a POE injector or router.  It's funny, but I bought two cheap POE dlink router last year from Fry's for $20/ea on clearance..  I returned it two weeks later because I had no need for POE devices.  If I had know I would of kept it so I can set up my security system with POE cameras.  I went back to Fry's last week and the POE Dlink router was $139 (similiar to what I returned).Since I've used it for one day my opinion of this camera may change. I'll be back to post anything good or bad about this camera like I've done with my other reviews.  So far so good. Great product.UPDATE: 7/11/10There is a $70 instant rebate on this camera so I just bought two more! They come out to $129/ea.Yes, I need a low light camera, but I haven't found one yet that is good at low light and good in the daylight.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Good Network Camera - Highly Recommended!", "Author": "C.

Its image quality in a good light is very good and sharp.Now the two bad points I've mentioned at the beginning of the review. Do not expect to use this camera to look at your babies or room in low light. You will not see anything. The higher end Panasonic cam is better suited for low light monitoring. Second, the sound...sound, sound....arg.... you need Internet Explorer because the sound is ActiveX-based. That means, no sound through Chrome, Safari, Firefox and no sound on your iPhone and Androids. Maybe someone enterprising can figure out how to get the sound support on iPhone apps but I don't know of any apps that supports sound on iPhone.Panasonic, it's really a poor judgement to rely on Active X plug in in this day and age where so many people have non-Window smartphones.

Luckily I have a Windows machine and was able to set up the camera.  The setup has different modules depending on what you want to do.  There is one to get the camera onto the network where you can continue the setup on the camera's embedded web interface.  There is another module for recording video and images on your computer.  They are typical inelegant and confusing Windows style apps.  If you like older Windows apps, fine, you'll like these.  So there are multiple apps and multiple pieces of documentation in different places -- on paper, and on disk, etc.You cannot register for the [...] internet portal if you are using an Apple Airport because they are not UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) compatible.  At least the older flying saucer models aren't.  I am not sure about the new square 802.11n models.  I even tried manual port forwarding, and that failed.  I did solve the problem by plugging the modem ethernet into a D-Link Broadband Router, then plugging both the camera and AirPort into the router.

No complaints on the camera itself.  The issue is with the setup to view online.  It requires an account throught Panasonics viewcam.net web site.  Getting that all setup and enabling the camera to be viewed on-line can be difficult and not to probably be attempted by a novice or general user.  It took me a number of attempts to get the on-line viewing setup correctly so that I could view from another location.  Now that it is working it works great and I have no issues, it just took a while to get it setup right.  I had to do some port forwarding from my dsl modem to my wireless router to view from another location.  Now when I want to view the camera I am required to go to the Panasonic viewcam.net web site.  One nice thing is once you are on the site you have access to live view, buffered view (recorded video), and all the admin and configuration settings.I have used the camera from work but you will need to test out your work connection as sometimes the ports that are used for the camera are blocked by your companies network team.  Being in IT I was able to get around this but it might be an issue for other users.  I can view from my phone but it would probably chew up data plan limits if done for a period of time.I used the camera a lot from work when we were having a basement finished and I had to have the contractors in the house when no one was there.  I had the camera pointed at the basement door and when the contractors would come and go I could easily see if they were wandering around the house when they shouldn't have been.  The nice feature on this is you can set the camera to record to its own memory, when it detects either sound or movement.  I used that for when the contractors were there and later in the day I could see what they were up to in my house.  I only have one camera but you can add more around the house.  Just remember this model uses ethernet cable only, it is not wireless.  Panasonic offers a wireless version but this one is not it.  That could limit your ability to put around the house unless your house is cabled or you are using some other device to extend your ethernet connection to where the camera is.Overall I think the camera itself is very good.  Panasonic just needs to improve the setup of the camera to view on-line or it will limit this product to more advanced users.  Also, the price is not cheap compared to other products in the same category.

I'm in the middle of installing them now, and was disappointed to find this out. I had planned this project around using standard POE from my Cisco SG200-08P switch. I'll get by with the included POE injectors, but it adds complexity to my project. Extra patch cords, extra wall warts, extra space for this extra stuff.That said, I have tested the camera and in all other respects it meets my expectations. Will add more to this review after I have completed my project and run the camera for a few days.UPDATE: I've been running the camera for two days now, and am satisfied with it. I've added 2 pictures showing the POE injector mentioned above.I have this thing mounted on the outside of my house, but I live in a mild climate and the camera is under the eaves so it won't get wet. The camera has a pretty good range of movement, both up-down and side-to-side. This is pretty handy for final setup - I can just steer the camera to where I want it while watching the screen. No need to run up and down ladders while getting things situated. There is no zoom, but I knew that going in and I am fine with it. The picture quality is pretty good during the day. At night it's not so good; you can see recognizable shapes, but that's about it. For instance, I can recognize my wife by her shape ... but if I caught a burglar on camera at night, the picture would be nearly useless. Not enough information to pick him out of a lineup!The web software has a LOT of settings. You can ignore them at will; aside from the initial password setup, none of them are necessary to basic operation of the camera. I have tested it with both Google Chrome (version 25.0.1364.97 m) and Internet Explorer 10 (version 10.0.9200.16484) and both browsers work well. There are IPv6 settings which I have not yet used. IPv4, the camera can use DHCP or static IP address and subnet settings. You can change the port that the camera's web server runs on, set it to use HTTPS, Dynamic DNS, and the NTP server of your choosing (for keeping the internal clock accurate). The camera can include date/timestamp and a short string of user-defined text in all its images.It can store images at specified times, or whenever it senses motion or sound. The sensitivity for motion and sound triggers is adjustable. These images can also be emailed or uploaded to an FTP or HTTP server. The camera can stream video via H.264 or MJPEG-4. It has a microphone and relays audio to whomever is watching the camera's web page. It also has a speaker, which can sound an alarm tone, but apparently there is no way to send voice through that speaker (to use it as an intercom, basically).There is a \"privacy\" button on top, which would allow a person in the room with it to disable the camera and microphone. However, this button can be disabled in software and the person under observation wouldn't know that. There's also an indicator light on the front of the camera - it too can be disabled in software. The camera also has connections for two sensors, for example a door/window sensor or a motion detector - I'm not using those so I can't say much about them.Whew, that's a lot, and I have not covered it all.The camera does capture enough detail for my use. In daylight, I saw a bug flittering around on my lawn about 15 feel away, but couldn't make out what kind of bug it was. I can see and recognize my cat when she is across the street, maybe 75 feet away. Faces are recognizable within about 18 feet, I would say.I'm using a piece of software called \"Vitamin D Video\" (VDV) to monitor the camera and record events of interest to me. VDV allows me to draw boundaries on the picture, and record segments whenever anything steps into the boundaries I have drawn. VDV makes it very easy and quick to review the captured video. I really recommend that software.I bought this camera when it was selling for $75 and at that price I would say it's a great deal. The POE issue was a disappointment, and the lack of night lighting may be a drag for some folks.

Comparing specifications, the Foscam has night vision, which the Panasonic does not. However, I went for the Panasonic looking for built quality and reliability, and it turned to be a wise decision.Built quality of the C210 is very good, clearly much better than Foscam. The plastic feels good and the package is sturdy. The pan-tilt and other fuctions work flawlessly and very precise, and the manuals and software, despite being basic, are well developed. Internet conection works very good also.The lack of night vision may be an issue, but from my experience, leaving just a small bulb turned on in the room will let you see what is happening (of course, with lack of detail). One important issue is that night vision may not be advisable in a room where PIR motion detectors are working, as they look for changes in Infrared Light, which is the source of light night vision systems uses to \"see\" in the dark.Mounting was easy. Software and network installation worked good, but it was not that easy. This is not an issue for this model, it is the same for all IP cameras. Configuring a network and external internet access is not like installing the new version of IE. It requires some basic knowledge of networks which is above the average user. If you are not comfortable with basic IP configuration, port forwarding and so on, it is a good idea to hire a technician to do it for you.Image quality is reasonable for the purpose. A surveillance camera is not for filming the next Episode of Star Wars. Even pro security cameras, which cost more than twice of consumer models, don't have great video quality.So, unless night vision is a must, you won't be wrong with this model. Even if you need night vision, you may consider just leaving a light on. On camera IR leds, in models like Foscam, won't let you \"see\" very far, so if the room is not small it won't be useful either. Finally, one thing to consider regarding accessing using the Internet. I do it regularly and it is a \"must have\" feature for me, but in practice, realibily depends on the quality of your Internet conection, both at home and in the place you are.

Setup wad pretty much straight forward but can get confusing when getting to advanced setup, such as; internet viewing.Use: Pretty good image quality if you connect to the camera directly.

Sound works fine on the iPad using Live Cams HD Pro.The not so great:-It doesn't come with a network cable. It would be better if they at least packed one in there because it requires two to use. Not a big deal, just a inconvenience if you over looked this.-The panning, Even though the camera is an orb in front, it only tilts from the middle down and pans left and right.

I am pretty technically savvy and I have an extra windows laptop kicking around so I figured I would get this model which would be easier because it is wired instead of wireless, and I would just plow through the tricky one-time set-up.  I gave up and returned it to Amazon without ever getting it to work.  Some reviewers apparently did get it to work by spending a lot of time on the phone with customer support and changing a lot of their network settings, but after looking at the astoundingly poor documentation and the crude and primitive software windows software that seemed to come straight out of 1980, and fighting for an hour, I just lost the will to fight.  Its a personal choice, but for me spending a little more money to save hours of aggravation is a trade worth making.  These situations are so frustrating and they so rarely work out well that I have learned to cut my losses early rather than fighting forever only to be let down in the end.  Back to the drawing board to find another solution.  Might work for lucky PC-based households with the latest router settings and some good networking skills, but I am not that household.  Off to the post-office to return it.  Bummer.UPDATE:I found an alternative solution that is working quite well: I went with the \"Lorex LIVE SD7 Wireless Digital Security System\" which includes two nice waterproof night-vision capable wireless cameras and a single base station that looks like an electronic picture frame. Then I jacked the AV out into a Slingmedia Slingbox solo which transmits it over the internet to any web browser or android, iOS device. Works exceptionally well for me, with no monthly monitoring fees or anything. But your mileage may vary. Here's some potential downsides: some people complain about reception issues with the Lorex over long distances, but if you keep in mind that the screen is blanked out when it is in AV out mode, and you want it next to the Slingbox and your internet router, then there is no reason you cannot put it somewhere where it gets good reception, as I did. Secondly, out of the box, you cannot remote control the system, but it does record automatically upon detecting motion and put an icon on the screen telling you there is a recording waiting for you to play back later. The slingbox does have a remote IR repeater and the Lorex remote appears to use IR, so it should be possible to set up remote control over the internet, but it would require \"teaching\" the commands to the slingbox using their custom remote set-up utility (remotes(dot)slingbox(dot)com) and I haven't gotten around to that.  Note, this might be a good idea since the remote that comes with the Lorex is a little flimsy.  Additionally, the color rendition on the cameras is not great because the sensors are able to pick up the infrared night-vision illumination as well. The color is fine and it is good enough, but it is hardly deeply saturated or accurate. Also, keep in mind that while the data transmission is wireless, you do need to find a way to feed power to the cameras - minor issue, but does require a little advance planning. And the last quibble I would raise is that the camera stands are a little flimsy - they don't thread into the bottom of the camera well and if you muscle them to adjust them without loosening first, you will strip them. So be gentle and careful. Otherwise, this is a great solution. I have three cameras up and running and I am going to get a fourth and leave it permanently in \"quad\" mode where you can see all four cameras at once. I can view anytime from any computer, any iPod touch, any iPhone or any iPad (don't own any Android gear, but I think the slingplayer app works well on android too.)
