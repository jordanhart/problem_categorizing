It is an excellent camera in both day and night. The image is very nice. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice cheap backup camera.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works OK but all have failed in about 1 year", "Author": "Gary Fortelney", "ReviewID": "R3V8VZ3QUDHZV0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera quality it OK for the the price.I bought five of these less than a year ago and all them have failed. Half of the IR lights have quit working on four of the five and the last one no longer gives a picture the IR lights work but that is it (probably because it only lasted about 6 months before I replaced it).  I ended replacing all the units with another manufacturer for less cost, higher resolution 600 TVL compared to these with 420 TVL and they also have a one year warranty, compared to these that have a 30 day warranty.I would stay away from all VideoSecu products unless you feel like replacing them every year.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Half Works", "Author": "Old", "ReviewID": "R1QR6EKJKRHWPD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera now for about 5 days.Pros:  It's wider screen than I expected, something along the line of 120 degree field of view. That's a big plusfor my requirements.  It has a good quality for a lower priced camera. Easy to install, IR's seem to work out to about 20 ft.Cons: It NEVER switches to black and white, even in a totally blacked out room.  It does pick up some stars and flying aircraftlights at night.  It has a defective pixels so that at night it looks like stars.The sun cover/shade works ok for shielding the lens from the sun but at night it is a total failure. The IR leds reflect backfrom the sun shade and leaves you with a white/gray screen.  You can only use the camera at night if you remove the sun shadefrom the camera. I tried taping black mat paper and black felt onto the bottom of the sun shade but the camera still isn't useable.The first problem appears to be a defect in switching to black and white at night.  The second problem is a design flaw. That's why moreexpensive camera use black non-reflective paint near the lens pickup area.I will not be buying this brand again.OK, rated this at 3 stars. Now I am rating it a 1. I would rate it a negative if I could.Today about 2 weeks after I received the camera it quit. All I get out of the camera now is streaks and tearing white lines.So It's junk, don't buy it.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005USIWG6"}}
