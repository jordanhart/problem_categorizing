{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "E. Randall", "ReviewID": "R32EVY9VW60177", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera and I love it. The pictures are awesome quality. I recently took it to a rodeo and using the action photo setting, took several pictures of bull riders and there was no blur. Using the portrait setting, I took several great shots of friends. While you don't get sound with your movie, it still turns out great. I have used this camera so much in the past few weeks. It is small and lightweight. I have a lot of photography experience with advanced SLR cameras and I needed a small point and shoot digital camera for quick pics. I am really impressed with the quality of this camera. I use it much more than my SLR camera now. I don't even have a memory card for it and it stores 13 or 14 high quality shots on it at a time. I am looking right now for a memory card so i don't have to keep uploading pictures, but it is worth every penny. I would recommend getting some rechargable batteries. Regular batteries get drained quickly and that gets costly. I would also recommend a memory card. I am glad i purchased this camera. Lots of people have commented to me on how cool the camera looks too. Overall 5 out of 5. It is a great camera to use. It is foolproof. Anyone could work it. the dial with different settings do the work for you.", "Date": "August 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "My first digital", "Author": "Evelyn D. Cruze \"evwings\"", "ReviewID": "R1LQ0OYV7R3TSN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband bought me this camera recently as he was tired of me always borrowing his.  I love it.  I didn't want too much camera for beginning and this one is so very user friendly. The display is a good size and very accurate.  The pictures from using the zoom are not distorted. Downloading the pictures to my computer is very, very easy. I like the various features, and changing them is a two step process, but not difficult at all. The batteries do go down fairly quickly, but no more than my husband's Kodak.  I haven't used the movie mode at this time.For an easy to use beginner camera, the 545 is a good choice.", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good camera for a beginner", "Author": "rhododendron", "ReviewID": "R1BJ2O4HI09BM5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is pretty good. I've updated mine since because I don't think 4 megapixels is enough, but if it's enough for you, good!The picture quality when I developed them 4 x 6 is good. It's a lightweight camera and very sleek looking. Lots of shooting modes to choose from. Very easy to use. The cd it comes with to play around with your pictures is a nice bonus!Now on to the bad...no viewfinder so your batteries get eaten up VERY quickly. There also is no sound for the movies, but I never used the movie mode anyway so I didn't care. The main reason I updated from this one is because the lag time when taking pictures is way too long! Mine would take up to 3 seconds, that's pretty slow if you think about it. Just smiling there...waiting for the picture to take...I like this camera though. If you don't mind the lag time, it's perfect!", "Date": "June 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good for amateurs and beginners", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "RLVVV55VOKIMH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just test-ran this camera all day:-Although it managed to take some shots well, the metering is not very good overall. The pictures seem overexposed.-The menu mode is very basic. (Could be a PRO for beginners).-There is no viewing prism. It can get annoying to always look at the LCD screen.-When zoomed in, WITH OPTICAL, the images come out pretty grainy. This is strange with an optical zoom. It should really only be  a problem with the digital zoom, since digital zoom just crops and magnifies the image itself, thus losing image quality.If you just want to take snapshots or are a beginner with cameras, you may enjoy this camera. If you are more serious, this camera will probably be a let-down.", "Date": "April 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "A good camera for the price", "Author": "D. Maxwell", "ReviewID": "R39UGULBNSHRL7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good for my intended purposes. I use it mainly for close-up shots. The video is good, but NO SOUND! (it does not have a built-in microphone). It uses two AA regular or rechargable batteries (saves money on batteries). The built-in memory is handy if you don't need a lot of memory (at any one given time), but it also has a memory slot for an Olympus XD-picture card (a negative, since it is proprietary).", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great investment.", "Author": "Cookiemonster", "ReviewID": "R5LTSBM29W99F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just love this camera.

Luckily I have another Olympus camera so I was able to get the pictures into the computer. I use this camera for a research so I didn't bother sending it back.

It is smaller than my first compact digital (a Canon A70), but much larger than the current line of compact digital cameras.- Battery.  Uses easy to find AA batteries.  So you are not tied to a battery recharger.  This is especially nice when you travel.  Unfortunately, very few of todays compact/point and shoot cameras use AA batteries.  This is probably to be able to make the camera smaller.Con- Battery.  The camera seems VERY fussy about the battery.  Olympus says to us NiMH batteries, but mine does not like them.  The camera says the battery is empty way too often, and I have had to \"cherry pick\" which NiMH batteries to use with this camera.  No problem with standard Alkaline batteries, which Olympus says to use \"in emergency.\"  I think the problems is the battery voltage, NiMH is slightly lower than Alkaline, so the camera thinks the NiMH is \"dead\" when it still has juice left.  I have not tried it with the lithium battery.- Shutter Lag.  As was mentioned, this camera has to me what seems like and abnormally long shutter lag.  Press the shutter and it seems like several seconds later it finally fires.  And this is even when doing a half press of the shutter before pressing the shutter fully down, which in my old Canon reduced the shutter lag.- Control knob is very easy to knock out of position. I found myself shooting a video many times w/o realizing it.  Quite upsetting, as video can eat up the memory card and your battery.It was nice \"in its day\" but I would not buy one today.  For the same/similar price you can find better cameras.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "NO STAR CAMERA", "Author": "Robert L.

However, we noticed that the batteries that came with the camera did not work in the camera. So we purchased two new batteries, and planned to take the camera to our class a few days later to take pictures of everyone. The night before, we tried the camera, just to make sure it was up and ready. But, alas, it still did not work. We ended up having to take our more reliable personal camera for the task.

What is the point of making a movie if you cannot hear it?The much-advertised in-camera help feature is basically non-existant. If you can even find it, it is not much help. Plus, the \"basic help menu\" the give you in the box is VERY basic, only telling you how to put in the batteries and take a picture. They give you a \"advanced help menu\" that you much install into your computer. It did not work on my computer, neither did the photo editing software they give you.I would not reccomend this camera, unless you don't care about anything but taking very simple pictures.", "Date": "July 4, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "4.0-megapixel CCD captures enough detail for photo-quality 11 x 15-inch prints\n3x optical zoom; 1.8-inch color LCD; 14MB internal memory\n19 selectable shooting modes (includes QuickTime Movie Mode)\nIn-camera Help Guide with shooting mode samples and descriptions\nPowered by 2 AA-size batteries (included); stores images on xD-Picture Cards", "Name": "Olympus D545 4MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BZNNXWK2L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0007CZ3EE"}}
