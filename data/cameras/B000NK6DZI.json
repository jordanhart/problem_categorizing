{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Blend of Still Pix, Video, and Compact Size", "Author": "J. Weber", "ReviewID": "RW2CM2YLK9TWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After testing the Canon TX-1, this has been my experience:PHOTO QUALITY:  Excellent. Canon wisely uses in-camera noise reduction (blurring) lightly and preserves sharp detail.  On close magnification, single pixel detail is present, which the Panasonic DMC-TZ3 that I compared blurred details into a gradient.  Color saturation and contrast are excellent.  Focus is fast and accurate.  Overall, superb qualtiy still pictures.VIDEO QUALITY:  Very good.  Quality is roughly midway between DV and a dedicated HD camcorder.  Though criticized by some for their large file sizes, Canon's Motion JPEG compression codec yield video that is of excellent contrast, and good color saturation.  I took video samples and re-compressed them using Canon's codec (included with their camera's software) and other codecs including MPEG2, QuickTime, and multiple other codecs from Adobe Premiere, and found that the Canon motion-JPEG, though theoretically not as efficient a compression scheme, ended up with the best quality video, while other codecs of similar file size were more washed out.  Another advantage of this compression scheme is that you can get good quality frame captures, as each frame is compressed individually.  It's not perfect:  unlike my dedicated HD camcorder, the TX-1's video has a vague \"shimmering\" effect, from the JPEG compression varying from frame to frame.  Also, with moving objects, the motion isn't quite as fluid with as with my dedicated HD camcorder.  But for a combination still/video platform, the video of the TX-1 is remarkably good.  File sizes are large, but they will be with any high quality video.ERGONOMICS:  In my medium to small hands, the camera is easy to hold.  Some reviewers complained that they needed to use their left hand to stabilize the camera, but I always hold cameras with two hands.  This one can be held with one, but any camera will yield less blurry pictures if held with two hands.  If you have large fingers, you may find this camera too small.CONVENIENCE:  The LCD folds into the camera, and there is no optical viewfinder, so when the camera is closed, there is no vulnerable glass to scratch up on any side.  And it is so tiny that you can throw it in a pocket or bag or purse and pull it out for an unexpected spontaneous shot.FLASH:  I was worried that the flash would be too under-powered.  It is a weak flash.  Unexpectedly, this turned out to be a good thing.  I've noticed with past cameras that indoor flash pictures screamed \"FLASH!\" and were bright with a thin dark shadow next to foreground objects from the flash.  This weaker flash ironically ends up making more natural shots as it doesn't saturate the shot and some existing light adds to make a more pleasing picture.  The flash is too weak to brightly light up a large dim room that you are shooting from a long distance, or if you zoom in under dim conditions.ZOOM:  10X zoom is really powerful; I can zoom in a lot more than I expected.  The excellent image stabilization allows these zoomed in shots to not be blurred from camera motion.LOW LIGHT:  Like virtually all compact cameras today, the tiny CCD does not perform well in very low light shots without flash. The TX-1 is no exception. Fuji cameras are known for better performance in low light, but currently don't have optical image stabilization.  The image stabilization in the TX-1 (and other cameras with this feature) help a lot because you can use much longer shutter speeds and make up for the small CCD.PLAYBACK:  It has been fun for me to plug the camera into my widescreen TV and watch the photos and video in a combined slide show.  That format is fun for the family and allows everyone to enjoy the memories without having to sit by a computer monitor or wait for prints.PROBLEMS:  The only thing I've not enjoyed is that the small LCD makes it harder to see detail in composing a shot, especially in bright sunlight.OVERALL:  The TX-1 produces excellent quality still pictures, very good 720p video, is tiny, not easily scratched, has a huge zoom, great image stabilization, and will end up being something you will want to toss into a pocket or bag and capture a spontaneous, memorable moment.  It is a rare camera that can record both stills and video without one of them being useless.  I'm very happy with it.  I hope you enjoy whatever you decide on too!", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Do not buy it for its camera features, but for its HD video capability...", "Author": "M. E. Balzer \"What is Reality?\"", "ReviewID": "R2CLQJ82IX9ZMW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Do not buy this camera if you are looking for either a great camera or camcorder, buy it as the best micro image recording device available.As you will find in other reviews, the camera portion is average.  What makes this camera stand out is the fact that it will do 1280 X 720, 30 frames PROGRESSIVE!  This is simply amazing since this camera is no larger than a box of cigarettes.  It is not perfect though.  There are few manual controls, e.g. no shutter rate or ISO control, however you do have control over locking ASE and Focus, as well as white balance.  Some reviewers have complained about ergonomics, but a small monopod or makeshift grip that attaches to the tripod mount will do the trick.  I personally would have preferred a REC button in front of the camera.  If I could also make a couple of wishes, I would also ask for an external 1/8\" stereo external microphone connector, as well as LANC control that could be used for zoom, focus, record/pause and stop.  Finally, low light levels are very noisy.There are also concerns about battery power.  I have been able to go an hour without a charge.  Again, it is suggested to buy an extra battery.  If you really need to have this camera running continuously, buy the external power adapter.  If you need more remote power, buy one of those extra lithium ion external power packs that has an output of 3.5 volts and retrofit a coaxial plug to fit the external power adapter.Some reviewers are complaining about Canon using the Motion JPEG file format for video.  True it is not the best compression format for making small files, but the quality is better than most MPEG 4 or even MPEG 2 file formats.  Plus, you get frame by frame editing.  To make up for the poor compression, just buy a larger card.There are also some questions if this camera can support more than a four gigabyte SD card.  Yes, but it will need to be a fast SDHC card.  This poses its own problems because it is not backwards compatible with SD card readers so you will not be able to use it with any card reader unless it specifically says it is compatible with SDHC.  This is not too great of a problem since the camera uses a standard mini USB female connector and XP, Vista, OS X recognize it without additional software.In  my opinion, this has been my answer to a stealth high definition documentary camera.  I will find many uses for this camera in the upcoming months.  Look for my documentary \"Gamer: The chronicles of Evanor\" [...] to be released at the end of the year.  It will contain footage from this camera.I gave it a four out of five stars for not adding an external microphone adapter, LANC control, and a few more manual controls.  This would have garnered a perfect score from me.  I hope Canon is listening.", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Perfect for me", "Author": "P. Yoon \"race fan\"", "ReviewID": "R269IJ6CVG74N5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TX1 is exactly what I'm looking for.  In order of importance, I was looking for something (1) small that (2) takes good/excellent video on (3) flash memory that will (4) work with my Mac and (5) can replace my point-and-shoot camera.  I'm not particularly fond of taking video so I didn't want to buy a camcorder that only took video and was large, or at least larger than the TX1.  However, for those times that I do want to take video, this is perfect, and the picture quality, imo, is great.  I can have it with me all the time because it's small.  It's not as small as some cameras, but what do you expect for all that it does?  This is cheaper than Panasonic and Sanyo equivalent camcorders, the small ones also with pistol grip.Those hoping for video quality on par with an HD camcorder are looking in the wrong place.Personally, I think the videos and still shots are fine for this type of device.  The clips and photos I take with the TX1 aren't being broadcast, and they're not going in magazines.  So for what I need, it's perfect.  Actually, the video quality is better than my (older) MiniDV camcorder.  And the truth is, I never use that older DV camcorder anymore.  With my old camcorder I didn't like watching unedited clips from the machine itself, so I had to tranfer them to my computer, which was cumbersome.  The clips from the TX1, while large, transfer via USB, so that's faster than the DV transfer.  And like I mentioned, better picture quality.  I've already used the TX1 more in the past 14 days than I have used my DV camera in the past two years.  When I want to \"serious\" pictures I haul my D200 and lenses.  If you want to take \"serious\" video, buy something dedicated, which will be more expensive.As for photo quality, I have not printed anything, but viewing it on my computer, the pictures seem on par with other point-and-shoot shots.  There is fuzziness and focus searching in low light conditions, but that's what I've come to expect with point-and-shoots; they're inherently limited machines.One last thing, you can zoom while shooting video in the highest quality; you can zoom in any video setting for that matter.", "Date": "June 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great hybird with a few flaws", "Author": "H. Kim \"mac geek\"", "ReviewID": "R186RNG7C5JNNP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a Canon TX1 and have it about a week now and I'm very happy with my purchase.  It's not perfect, it does have some pretty sticky issues, most that I've been able to work around though.The camera itself is a joy to use.  Great menus, easy to use, even in manual mode, and my smaller hands don't make this the ergonomic nightmare that tech critics are panning the camera work.  There are a few things that could be changed, the shutter button could be placed maybe someplace else (not really sure where though so maybe it is in the best spot) but I've gotten used to it and it take pictures pretty well with it.  The auto focus speed isn't terrible as others have noted unless your at full max zoom (and at 10x I can forgive a bit of auto focus speed issues).  The 16:9 aspect photos are very clear, I hear the professionals talk about excessive noise in low light and at high ISO, but I haven't seen it so far with mine, but I'm also not a trained photographer nor do I have a trained eye for that.  It takes photos, they're clear and in focus, the colors are accurate, that's really all i can ask for.  In indoor lighting it is a little more difficult to take good photos, but it is possible.  Outdoors though there are no issues whatsoever, it's just a fun point and shoot 7 megapixel beauty that I'm glad I own now.Video is another story though.  At 1280x720 30fps, the video is good in bright conditions. In medium indoor lighting or less, the video becomes very very grainy.  Not surprising maybe, but a little disappointing.  It's obvious from the LCD that the video is going to be grainy, and on my HDTV or on the computer, it looks VHS like grainy, the quality just isn't there.  The resolution might be there, but things although in focus, look like upscaled SDTV or worse.  Outdoor video shooting is similar to the photo quality, everything works great.  It looks great on the HDTV.  But indoor video is very grainy unless you have very well lit conditions.  At the price I guess you shouldn't expect a product to compete with HDV camcorders though.  And HDV camcorders don't do 7 MP stills.Some people have complained about the MJPEG format for video.  With an 8 GB SDHC card, you get get 27 minutes of shooting time.  And bigger SDHC cards will exist in the future.  MJPEG may not be the most advanced codec like AVC is, but it certainly is still useable and great to edit movies with and older computers can watch MJPEG with little computing power.  On my old Mac, the H.264 files I converted the MJPEG films from choke my computer at full resolution.One big flaw I find is that in OS X, when you plug in the camera, it does not mount the SDHC card, but rather iPhoto or Image Capture just grabs the images and downloads them.  But there's no way to reverse the process without a dedicated SDHC card reader.  I believe that holds true for many Canon models though, not just the TX1.  Again annoying, but there are work arounds.Overall I'm still giddy about my purchase.  I love the product.  It would have been a 5 if it had better indoor / low light performance.  Other than that, this is a great product, and hopefully will only get better with the next version (please Canon keep updating this product).", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT", "Author": "Bruce R. Peterson \"MRP84627\"", "ReviewID": "R10ZP4Z2INEUZS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took a chance on the TX1 and I am SO GLAD that I did.  Just before leaving on an extended cruise I found that my digital camera had some issues so I decided to purchase a new one.  Having suffered through dragging around several different kinds of still and video cameras on previous vacations and events, I resolved that whatever I came up with, it had to be extremely portable and not a hindrance to any planned activities.  After the frustration of seeing Paris mostly through a video viewfinder a few years ago, I gave up taking video on vacations.  But, a side of me still wanted to have HD video available when needed.  So, after reading as much as possible about the TX1 on the internet (instructions, reviews, etc) I decided to make a leap of faith.  I eventually found a vendor with one available and it arrived just a couple of days before we left for the cruise.  Armed with a very fast 8 Gig card and a couple of extra batteries we set off.  A couple of days into the cruise I was hooked.  I carried it in my pocket the whole trip no matter what I was wearing (except when swimming obviously)!  No bag over my shoulder or strap around my neck to get in the way.  It was always ready to capture the moment.  And capture the moment it did....in high form.  I downloaded the photos and video to a laptop several times and we were all IMPRESSED with the high quality of the stills and videos that it captured.  There are so many different scene options available to cover any situation that we wanted to capture.  The colors of foliage and ocean are vibrant and true.  And, when I, in hast, used the wrong settings, I was always able to make a simple correction of the colors in Photo Elements.  The detail of the HD video looks great on out 52\" HDTV as do the photos.  I averaged a hundred still photos and about ten minutes of video per day for twenty days.  I found that the battery life was much better than I had expected given some reviews I had seen, but a second battery would be a good investment if you like to take many photos without recharging. (Only about $12 if you look online)  Some of the reviewers I have read simply must not have spent any time becoming acquainted with the camera or they expected it to be a \"studio\" unit because every \"short-coming\" I found listed in the reviews had a quick and simple solution in the menu settings or with a realistic view of the target audience for this camera.  Without any doubt, the TX1 is the best camera I have ever found for my style of use.  In summary it is extremely compact and easy to transport while delivering excellent high definition still and video output.  But...

Although it may not have saved her from the bears, it would have certainly met all of her other particular criteria.I bought this camera direct from Japan a few months ago when its introduction to the US market was delayed, and have not regretted the purchase.  (Once I was able to find the menu setting to display in English rather than Kanji...)Elph sized, this recording device can do any sort of capture you desire to best preserve those special (and mundane) moments.  It's not too big (like most Hi-def camcorders).  It's not too small (so if you want a spy camera, look elsewhere).  Its size is just right - fits in my pocket, my wife's purse, and surreptitiously in one hand when I want to sneak some video I shouldn't be taking.Functionally, it will record images and videos in every resolution any prosumer could need.  For video, you can capture all frame sizes and rates - from full HD (1280, 720p, 30fps) down to 640x480 15fps, both 16:9 and 4:3 ratios.  For images, it does everything any other good digital camera does, from 10X *optical* zoom to macro, image stabilization, and \"quick settings\" for portraits, night shots, even \"aquarium lighting.\"  (The 10X optical zoom is awesome, btw - I've never found this on any but the pro/commercial end cameras.)  The 7.1Megapixels are plenty for most digital imaging tasks, supporting 8x10 prints indistinguishable from any other higher res images.I've edited the HD video, and it is very easy to work with - much more so than H.264 video.  This is due to the fact that Canon uses motion JPEG compression, which allows each frame to stand on its own (kind of like snapping 30 images per second of 1080x720 pictures - not only can you edit down to the frame level easily, but you can extract a frame as a still image with all quality intact - handy when you want to make a nice picture from some video you've shot).It is true that for any specific function this camera performs, you can find another gadget out there that does the same function better.  But nowhere have I seen one device that handles *all* recording functions (video/image and sound) to the excellent degree that this camera does - you aren't compromising on function here to get the convenience of portability.The primary advantage of this camera is the fact that it truly does it all.  No more do I need to decide in advance whether or not I will want to shoot video on an outing (then deciding wrong and later trying desparately to capture that special live action moment on my 640x480 15fps camera, or worse yet my cell phone!).

But the large sized D-SLR is not convenient for those less formal spontaneous photographic moments such as when you're out with friends or when you're on a vacation and wish to relax rather than document. I needed a small light and uncomplicated point and shoot camera for those unexpected photographic moments. This fit the bill perfectly. I took mine for it's maiden voyage during a weekend vacation in London. As far as the photographs go the 7.1 mega pixel resolution pleased me quite a bit. The 16:9 aspect ratio was a new feature to me in still cameras and is my new favorite feature in the still photo department.But unlike any other still camera that I've used before, this one features the ability to capture 720p HD video at 30 frames per second. This coupled with a fast 8gb SDHC card will land you 28 minutes of highest resolution 16:9 aspect ratio video. Considering this is not a video camera that is excellent. This space is perfect for those moments where you would like a short video to merely capture a moment rather than document an event as you would with a actual video focused product. For instance a few minutes of myself and friends in the Absolute Ice Bar in London. Or the belly dancer in the next bar/lounge we visited.Ultimately I found the camera small, fast and uncomplicated for my level of technical ability which may be higher than the average consumer.

Lam", "ReviewID": "R33IFWKG1VPL9W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Canon Powershot TX1 in September 2007 to replace both a 3.2 MP Canon S30 still camera and a Sony DV camcorder. I selected the 720p/7 MP TX1 over the 720p/7 MP Sanyo HD700 and 1080i/4 MP Sanyo HD1000 because the TX1 (1) is a digital camera first (with Canon's reputation for photo quality) and a camcorder second, (2) has the smallest form factor (slightly thicker than Digital Elph), and (3) has excellent build quality.Having used the TX1 now for 7 months--photographing/videoing my new baby daughter on a daily basis, on weekend trips, and on our 2-week Mexico beach vacation--I rate the TX1 a solid four stars and give Canon a thumbs up for a strong first effort.Here's how I break things down:Video:The TX1 records its 720p video using the same inefficent Motion JPEG (MJPEG) codec that Canon uses in the rest of its cameras (in the AVI container/file format), as opposed to the modern H.264/AVC or AVCHD codec. The result are huge file sizes: an 8 GB SDHC flash card only hold 28 min of 720p video in the TX1 (though each file itself can be no bigger than 4 GB; this is a limitation of the FAT32 file system of SDHC and not the fault of the TX1), while an H.264/AVC or AVCHD camcorder can compress some 80 min of *1080i* video in the same 8 GB card (it's bitrate-dependent, of course). There is, however, the option of setting the 720p recording to 'LP' mode, which doubles the recording time, giving 56 min of 720p video on an 8 GB card--but I haven't tested how noticeable the degradation in quality is.Still, huge file sizes are not a deal breaker--just buy a couple of extra 8 or 16 GB flash cards or, better yet, an external travel hard drive with a built in flash card reader such as the Digital Foci Photo Safe (which worked great on our Mexico trip!). A tip: buy fast SHDC Class 6 cards (not Class 2 or 4)--you'll need it for smooth video recording. What the MJPEG codec does have going for it versus H.264/AVC or AVCHD is that virtually any Pentium4-class PC can play it using virtually any media player (Windows Media Player, Real Player, or Quicktime). And MJPEG can be edited by most video editors. This isn't true of H.264/AVC or AVCHD files, which, while efficient, requires significantly more computing power special software to decode/play back and, in particular, to edit.What kind of video quality do you get in these huge files? In well-lighted environments (daytime outdoors, mainly), the quality is quite good--definitely better than 720x480 DV.  Having been stuck in standard-def camcorder land up until now, I found myself smiling with satisfaction at the new-found clarity and detail in the TX1's 720p video and marvelling at how Canon managed to pack HD resolution into a pocket cam.  Still, I have to confess that the resolution, despite being nominally 720p, looks softer on my 50-inch 720p Panasonic plasma than what I expect true 720p video to be. It's certainly not as good as a dedicated 1080i HD camcorder (video from my friend's JVC 1080i Everio camcorder of the same beach shots looks crisper and has more detail). And in low-light (evening indoor situations without good lighting), forget about it--the TX1's video becomes grainy, and much detail is lost. Because of its small lens and CCD, low light performance is even worse than my old Sony DV camcorder.Nevertheless, with the TX1, these days, I no longer lug around both a camera and camcorder (plus all the requisite extra batteries, chargers, and big DV tapes) when I travel. I know full well the TX1's video limitations, so I accept the trade-off for portability.Photos:I'm no photography expert so I won't go in depth. Suffice it to say that the TX1 photo feature set and photo quality appear equivalent to current-generation canon Digital Elph cameras with Image Stabilization and Face Detection, but with the added bonus of a 10x optical zoom somehow shoe-horned in. Once the camera is turned on, the lens extends out of the body about 3/4 inch, and regardless of zoom, it doesn't extend any further. This 10x zoom lets you boldly go where few other pocket cams dare go and IMHO is almost enough to justify the TX1 price premium over a Digital Elph even if you don't use the HD video.The manual controls are limited to basic exposure and a white balance calibration mode; there are, of course, various canned shooting modes like 'night,' 'portrait,' 'beach,' 'snow,' etc., and various useless canned color schemes like 'sepia,' 'B&W;,' etc.It's worth noting that the TX1 allows you to take photos while recording video without switching modes, though with a brief 1.5-sec pause in the video for each photo taken. This is a killer feature that regular cameras (that I know of) don't have. No more 'mommy takes photos with the camera while daddy holds the camcorder' or figuring out whether to grab the camera or camcorder when the baby decides to try out a new trick she's been learning. This is one place where the TX1 shines.There is one quirk that should be known: the TX1 lets you select different resolutons for digital photos and for videos, of course. Max photo resolution is 3072x2304 in 4x3 mode (which is 7.1 MP) and 3072x1728 in 16x9 mode (which is only 5.3 MP; that is, it simply lops off the top and bottom of the 7.1 MP photo to make the 16x9). 720p video is 1280x720, and there is the run-of-the-mill 640x480 video. Ideally, I'd want to set photos to 4x3 7.1 MP and, simultaneosuly, video to 16x9 720p, but the TX1 does not allow this. If I want to shoot 720p video, then I have to set the camera global mode to 16x9, which forces the photos taken to also be in 16x9 (5.3 MP) mode. If I want full 7.1 MP photos, then I have to set the camera global mode to 4x3, which forces the video to be in 4x3 640x480 standard-def. In effect, because I want my video to always be in 720p, I'm forced to accept 16x9 5.3 MP photos. Otherwise, if I want both 4x3 7.1 MP photos and 16x9 720p video, I have to constantly switch back and forth between 16x9 and 4x3 modes. Again, it's not deal-breaker, but it is an annoying limitation.Finally, even with the anti red-eye function turned on, the TX1 produces terrible red eye in flash photos, worse than any camera I've seen and worse than other Digital Elph cameras. The reason lies with how close the flash bulb is to the lens (directly over it).  Considering how small the camera is, I'm not sure whether is a way around it.  Perhaps a pop-up flash would help.  It does have a built-in post-processing feature that lets you manually attempt to fix red eye in photos one incident at a time, but it's time-consuming and mostly ineffective. The only thing I've found I can do about it is to Photoshop the red eye out of photos I want to share or print.Form Factor and ErgonomicsSeveral reviews have disparaged the ergonomics of the TX1 because of the difficulty of one-handed operation of its small boxy shape and controls. But  with my medium-sized hands, I got used it in a matter of a few days, particularly using two hands (one-handed operation is just too shaky anyway with my caffeinated hands). To all those complaining about the ergonomics, I say it's a fine trade-off for the small size.The camera body is metal and has a solid, luxurious feel--definitely a cut above many plastic-bodied digicams these days. I woukd fault only the flimsy thin strip of a battery compartment cover, which requires a delicate touch each time you change the battery. Speaking of which, filming 28 min worth pf video (one full 8 GB card) will drain the battery, so you'll need to pick a couple of spares.The buttons (all are multi-function, depending on the mode the camera is in) are responsive, and the directional joy stick has a precise, positive feel. The on/off button is slightly recessed into the body to prevent accidental turn-on (and glows green when on), but it nakes it slightly difficult to use.Wish List for the next version of the TX1 (TX2?):- 1080i or 1080p using H.264/AVC or AVCHD.- The TX1 comes with component cables, plenty good enough to display 720p video on your HD TV. But it would have been nice to have HDMI, like the Sanyo HD700/1000.- Longer battery life and less-flimsy battery cover.- Reduced red-eye.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "This camera is awesome!!!", "Author": "Yuriy M.

I also agree that the addition of an external mic would make this camera a perfect 10 but for most purposes that is not an essential feature. One thing that I don't think has been mentioned is that the telephoto (zoom) functions are -disabled- when you are shooting in HD video mode.

There are so many reviews, both positive and negative, that it was almost confusing.  This camera is really for the individual that wants to be able to take both video and still photography.  Is this the best video camera?  No.  Is it the best still camera? No.  Is it the best combo camera?  Without a doubt.  It offers great versatility and quality in a compact, mobile package.First let me say that I have shot with a DSLR for years.  I love still photography and never thought about going back to point and shoot after owning a Canon Digital Rebel and now a Canon 40D.  But over time I wanted something smaller that I could fit in my pocket and take with me to many locations where a DSLR is just too prohibitive.  The Canon TX1 was the one for me.This camera is a just a little wider than some of the small profile Powershot cameras, but it fits very well into the pocket of your pants.  It is sturdy and the lens and LCD screen are protected.Video and Photo Quality:I was impressed by both the quality of the videos and photos.  The only pitfall is the ratio of still photos is 16:9 unless you go into the menu and switch to 4:3.  That's not horrible, but I wish there was a button to easily switch back and forth.  The zoom was awesome.  The videos and photos have great saturation and color.Use of Buttons/Camera:The buttons are small and if you are going to hold the camera up and record video for 30 minutes it can be a bit of a pain.  However, I don't plan on recording 30 straight minutes of video.  If I did, I'd likely be on a tripod.  The zoom button works very well and smoothly for transitions during video recording.LCD Display:I thought at first it might have too small of a display, however, after using it for a couple of weeks it works very nicely.  You can see everything you need to and the quality is excellent and bright.A couple of side notes:-The built in microphone is awesome.-My unit got a little warm when I heavily used it (recording lenghtly vids one after the other), but nothing that alarmed me.-I picked up 2 Transcend 16GB SDHC CARD (SD 2.0 SPD CLASS 6) with Compact Card Reader and they work great.  You get plenty of recording time and photo storage.  Fast transfer as well.-Some people feel that the camera misses the mark in being the perfect video camera or perfect still camera.

Images are sharp and colors are vividly true to the original scene. However, if you try to play the video clip straight out of the camera, they don't look as well, because most of the video players can't play the mjpeg video very well, and also the size of file is very large. However, if you try to compress it using VirtualDub (with file size reduced by at least 7-10 times), the resulting video plays so smoothly and the noise (in of low light situation) is so much reduced. I have no doubt that the video quality from this little gadget is way superior than most of digital camcorders on the market. I have a 3CCD Parasonic camcorder and when comparing TX1 videos with those of Parasonic, there is no doubt that TX1 is way better than Parasonic.The still pictures (using built-in flash) are also very good, considering that TX1 can also take excellent videos. Of course you can't compare the image quality with that of a SLR camera (with a dedicated flash), but all the pictures that I've taken indoor are of very good quality.To rip all these benefits from the camera, however, you have to invest a good high-speed SDHC card (e.g. ADATA 8GB or 16 GB class 6), which you can buy from eBay for about $60-100 (8-16 GB).

Small size was key for me, replacing an old Canon 4MP of about this size.  My main interest is stills. I wanted this camera for the unique 10x optical capability, with image stabilization, in this very small package.  My secondary interest was brief video clips in special situations.  I wanted the HD 16:9 format because I'm migrating everything to HD.  No other camera today would do these things.I delayed buying this camera because I was concerned about the ergonomics.  I wear a men's large glove size but have found no problem with the physical placement of controls in relation to hand size.  It takes 20 mins of shooting to get comfortable with the control placement, but I think that this is not an issue, as some have suggested.If your interests are similar to mine, I think that you will be quite happy with this camera, as I am.  As a quality check I carefully compared about two dozen still photos taken with the TX-1 with the same shots from a recent Canon SD700, also 7MP, and found the picture quality essentially identical when set to comparable zoom.  Apart from the tradeoff's noted here, the camera performs very well.The trade offs are: you get 10x zoom but a much smaller display and must \"open\" the display to shoot.  That trade off will not be to everyone's taste but if you want more zoom flexibility than most cameras this size offer, then, you, like me, may be happy with it. Also, I don't need the long shooting capability of dedicated HD camcorders or their ability to shoot indoors in dim light.  Finally, this camera has a weak flash, weaker than most pocket cameras and if you take a lot of flash pictures it isn't a very good choice.  I avoid them whenever possible, so that's ok by me.I love the 16:9 video format with stereo sound.  Files are big, but since I rarely shoot clips longer than 30 seconds, I don't care.  I merge, edit, convert all of them to mpeg-4 on my computer and they get small.In conclusion, if you prefer the features that this camera uniquely offers to the trade-offs, you, like me, will probably be very happy with it.

The AVI format produces great video without any blurring unlike other heavier compressions. I recommend an 8GB class 6 SDHC card to keep up with 720p recording. Battery life is quite good and lasted at least a full day in cold weather. The separate video record button is very handy. You can record at moments notice without having to fumble with modes, dials, etc. The small on/off button takes a bit of effort to operate but not too bad. At least I know it won't turn on by mistake when pocketed. The stills pick up a fair amount of noise in low light conditions especially if ISO increases over 80. Therefore, I have turned off auto ISO and fixed it at 80. To be fair, the noise levels are consistent with other cameras such as the SD500 and noticeable only if you are used to the quality of a DSLR. Overall, this camera is orders of magnitude better than any helmet cam (hopefully, I can find a strap to attach it to a helmet or arm). The 10X zoom is one of the best features of this camera especially for sports. One slight annoyance is when I take a still shot during a video shoot, the video gets briefly interrupted (this does not happen in the sony camcorder I have). So far, I have taken mostly VGA sized video and reserve the 720p video for special moments (including those which I plan to extract still frames). Regardless, I would highly recommend this camera for any sports enthusiast or traveler looking for a pocket sized camera with video capability. I also plan to take this to kids soccer games which would allow me to capture a combination of stills and video (like I did with the SD500 but with a more powerful 10x zoom and stereo audio). By the way, the key motivator for me getting the TX1 when I already have a SD500 is that unlike the SD500, the TX1 allows you to operate the optical zoom during video recording.

I've had a lot of digital cameras and must say that this is probably the best for most purposes.I like the hybrid cameras. Video is very important to me and the TX1 takes really good HD videos. They look super on an HD TV. The stereo sound is excellent. If you're willing to shoot in the 640x480 mode, you can extend the 10X zoom by either 1.5X or even 1.9X. Stills are excellent, typical Canon image quality.There were several negatives about the TX1 noted mainly by professional reviewers. Short battery life was one. This was easily cured by purchasing two Lenmar batteries and an extra charger that works in the car for a total of $37 from Amazon. The memory gobbling HD video gets about 30 min on an 8GB card. Sandisk 8gb SDHCs were on sale at Adorama for $33 and I bought several. Handling qualities were knocked by many reviewers. I'll admit that if I try one handed video, including zooming, I have trouble being totally steady. I've decided that this is a two handed camera for video. It's simple to use with one hand when taking stills, though.To me, the best camera is the one you have with you. I've bought my last camera that will not fit in a shirt pocket. That's the real beauty of the TX1. It's a small camera that you are most likely to have with you when the larger ones are at home on the shelf.I consider the TX1 to be an excellent camera and a good value.

Where the tx1 comes out on top is in its video quality.  In sound, color, focus, etc. the Tx1 takes markedly better quality movies.  Additionally, I have been pleased with the ability to zoom in and out while shooting a movie.Another neat feature of the TX1 is the camera's ability to choose an appropriate ISO speed to minimize blurring.  Of course, as always, the faster speed you use, the more noise you get, but there's a fine line between whether blurring/noise is preferable, and the camera (feature activated by pushing the \"print\" button while shutter is half-way depressed, so yes, may require two hands) is pretty good at making a decision when it comes to this trade-off.Some people have said that the shape and position of the controls on the TX1 make the camera difficult to operate, and I admit that it took a few days to get used to the vertical design.  Although it's possible to use the camera one-handed if you're just taking simple point-and-click photos, as with most camera models, making adjustments requires two hands.  The viewscreen is visible even in bright sunlight (unlike the S60), so I haven't bemoaned the lack of of a viewfinder.Bottom line: a solid camera for its size; recommended for people who mainly take still images but still like to take videos from time to time; enough manual controls for people who do mostly point-and-click photography or who only start making adjustments when not satisfied with what the camera's software chooses.  This is not a replacement for a high-powered SRL camera or a normal-sized video camera.

I suppose there are camcorders and regular cameras that provide higher quality for each its own specialty, but the TX1 provides both with exceptional quality.

True, the on-off button was a bit hard for me to depress, but I've learned to use the tip of my finger in a way that works.My previous camcorder was a Sony with settings operated with by LCD touch control.

This tiny joystick and the layout of commands is much better.A bonus was the voice recording function, which I can use for taking notes in the field, either in general or in association with a specific still image.My first digital camcorder cost nearly $2000 a few years back and it took lousy still images.

With this background and my comments below - you can see that I am no \"techo\" person, just a gadget geek that likes new stuff that takes good pictures and video! Well, when I saw the TX-1, I thought I had fallen in love \"again\" - it looked too good to be true. So I bought one! Currently, I'm also using a Canon G7 (also have the Canon SD700 and really like it - but gave it to my son) and LOVE IT!!! Many have complained about no RAW and other stuff - but I think it's a great camera that take excellent pictures as well as pretty darn good video!Well, back to the TX-1 - I won't comment on the looks (although I think it looks pretty neat) - I will just focus on how it worked and takes pics/video. Well - in a word - I was very disappointed. Believe me, I tried all the settings - both auto and whatever manual I could use. Pictures are totally inferior to the G7 (and SD700)and just about all the other cameras I've used lately. Simply too grainy, some out of focus, or under/over exposed. The 10X zoom was pretty cool - but did not make up for the poor picture quality.The video was also pretty bad (except for the ability to use the zoom). I think the biggest problem was \"focus hunting\". This has happened in other cameras I've used, but not as bad as the TX-1. It did not do well indoors or shadowy areas outside. The camera just could not cope with lighting changes. Again, video looked grainy (like the pictures) and generally not clear. It was very hard to hold the camera still during zooming (although the IS worked as good as it could - IS is not a miracle option - just a help).Bottom line - I'm keeping the G7 - returned the TX-1.

I wanted a compact, light weight camera (its about the size/weight of a double deck of playing cards) that would take good quality video (it takes 720 HD) and still pictures (it does 7.1 MP). I was also looking for a camera that would be smart enough to have both automatic \"point and shoot\" settings with image stabilization (for pictures on the fly) and extensive manual control of features like flash (supression/fill), ISO (it does 80-1600), etc. (when I had more time to compose my shots/use a tripod). I also wanted a powerful zoom (it has a 10x mechanical zoom) to bring in distant targets--think Bridel Viel Falls from Tunnel View. At the same time I wanted to be able to take extreme close ups of flowers, water droplets, or what have you (it has an excellent macro mode which operates even for HD video--you should see my inch worm monster movie!). I'm also happy that the TX-1 uses SD picture cards allowing for essentially limitless storage, remember HD video takes up a LOT of memory and a rigid hard disk size would have been to limiting (I like to use 16GB SD cards which hold about 45-50 minutes of video or up to 3000 stills or a proportional mix of each). It has a lithium-ion battery which lasts about 45-50 mins. with normal use of zoom, flash, etc. (conveniently this is about as long as a 16GB SD card will allow you to shoot HD video--note that the codec Canon uses allows you to shoot video in up to 15 minute segments--about 4.5 GB or the size of a DVD). This is not usually a problem, as most videos are much shorter, and if need be you can start recording again almost immediately. Canon's codec is also provides for very good picture quality and color balance even with playback on a 46\" 1080p HDTV. Their included software is quick and easy to use especially for downloading images, photo stiching, basic editing, and sending prints to my canon printer. I do have some nitpicks. It has a built in flash which allows still photography in dark conditions, but the video quality does suffer somewhat in low light (try the HI ISO setting it helps). Its small size does take some getting used to, but once you are comfortable with it you'll love its portability. I find it necessary to carry several SD cards and several batteries when out in the field, since the batteries take about 90 minutes to charge (I do this overnight). The camera strap is a sturdy but bulky leather contraption which is totally at odds with the rest of the cameras design--I replaced it immediately with one from an old relic I don't use anymore.

I was hoping that Canon's TX 1 would fill that need perfectly, but for reasons I am about to stipulate, it did not, and I find myself carrying the other two 90 percent of the time.  It's not that this camera isn't good - in fact, had I purchased this before either of the other two I would probably swear it was the greatest miracle on the face of the earth, but I have already used the other two cameras and when I use the TX 1 I find myself wishing that I had one of the others.Compared with the S3 IS -Cons:1.  the image stabilization doesn't work nearly as well since there is less room for the sensor to wiggle to accommodate your hand movement, and the lens being smaller lets in less light, forcing the aperture to stay open longer and therefore, increase the chance of blur.2.  The difference  between a 10 power and 12 power zoom was negligible though, but unlike the S3, a zoomed-in, low-light shot is impossible for this camera, so in low-light you might as well have a 3 power zoom, because that's the most you're going to get out of it.3.  The autofocus is also much slower and misses more of the time, especially zoomed in or in low-light conditions.4.  You don't have the ability to set the focus point manually, like you do with the S3, and there are also no manual controls for f/stop or shutter speed like on the S3 - only ISO (which I limit at 200 or the shots are too ugly with noise).5.  The 1.7 inch screen is barely big enough to be able to properly frame a shot, but most of the time I just find myself frustrated with it's size.Pros:1.  it does have a very neat function to manipulate the color setting of the picture AFTER you take it.  So you can make every shot you take B/W, Sepia or any of the other options that the camera has.  This is really great for me because I used to switch between modes quite a bit and always have a few shots that I wish I would have taken in another mode.2.  Video quality is superb (just like the S3) putting every other camera maker's video mode to shame.  But the zoom and start/stop buttons are impossible to manipulate without shaking the camera significantly.Compared to the SD 1000 -Cons:1.  Although it probably doesn't seem like much, having to flip out the screen and wait for the lens to pop out is kind of a drag and I find myself not nearly as willing to pull it out for those spontaneous shots as I do the SD 1000, just not as convenient as you would think.Synopsis -Although I do think the TX 1 does a good job of filling the middle ground between these two cameras, I just didn't realize that I wasn't willing to sacrifice any of the features of the other two - what can I say, I'm spoiled!

Sure, movies get grainy in-door / in low light situations, and sure you have to move slowly when taking movies (slowly zoom in and out).

And I've always been a huge fan of Canon's SD series - tiny pocket-cams which take great stills and decent video. This seemed like the next step - great stills and great video too. So I pre-ordered the camera as soon as I could, and waited eagerly for it to ship. And waited, and waited...When the camera finally arrived, I was surprised at the bulk and heft of it. Sure, it's still highly compact, but for someone used to the SD300 and SD600, this is a step backwards in portability. It makes my pockets kinda bulge. Right off the bat, strike one: my primary use case for the camera was to keep it in my pocket all the time. Once I tried it though, I realized that it'd have to go in a bag most of the time.Strike two: it's kinda awkward to hold. I have very large hands, so I rarely have a problem with any camera. I'm not sure if others would have the same experience, but it's worth noting, since I've always been comfortable with various other Canons, Nikons, and Pentaxes.Finally, my main criticism, Strike 3: Picture Quality. I wasn't happy with either the stills or the video. With the stills, I had trouble with the focus system. The face-tracking system seems useful at first, but when I viewed the photos on my computer, the focus never seemed quite right. Even when I switched to a more conventional focus mode, the picture quality just wasn't as satisfying as that of the SD600, an older and cheaper model.Video quality was, for me, the last straw. Sure, it may be technically HD, but for me, HD promises more than just resolution. When I think HD, I think sharp, clear, and vibrant. The video produced by the TX1 is high-resolution, it is wide-screen at 16x9 - but it's not really HD. The video picture is blotchy and fuzzy, and really no better than that, again of a much cheaper SD series camera. It's nice that it's wide, the video is definitely much better proportioned for today's wide-screen televisions, but it's not much of an advance beyond that, and it certainly isn't really HD.Also worth noting is that the video files produced by the TX-1 are immense, making it fairly inconvenient and/or expensive to use as a video camera. These file sizes certainly aren't justified by the video quality.To sum up: the TX-1 has an impressive array of features, and had the potential of being a truly groundbreaking device, of finally bringing HD video and stunning stills into a single pocketable device. Unfortunately, however, it doesn't deliver on quality, and it's not as pocketable as its predecessors, which take better stills and video that's nearly as good as the TX-1's.Ultimately, for me, the TX-1 wasn't satisfying as a still camera or a video camera. I've returned mine; I'm going to stick with my SD600 for now.I'm still eagerly awaiting the first truly pocketable device which shoots both high-quality stills and video. I'd even be willing to pay more than I did for the TX-1 - maybe that would give it a better chance of succeeding. In the meantime, I've got my eye on the Canon HV10 HD Camcorder to supplement my SD600 and Nikon D80.[...].", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "TX1 Way Over Priced", "Author": "C.

I wont bash it too hard but here is the Low Down, The Canon TX1 takes remarkable pictures, and very nice looking video, granted your outside.  The flash is weak and video looks terrible indoors, in HD or not, it's Grainy and no better then pocket vid size quality. The 16:9 aspect ratio is nice, cool they put a black bar on top and bottom.

It also makes this God awful Metal scraping sound when you turn it on. Dont try to film nature, it will scare everything in the forest for miles. The screen Super Small and quite honestly hard to read, and software isn't new at all. Every function works the same and of course no new themes, you'd think after 6 years they could come up with a new theme other then the birds chirping.

Very poor performance in a low lighting venue. For this type of camera one would expect better sensitivity to low lighting photo shots.Good for outside shots but not for indoors stills or movie low lighting.Battery life short and small dimm lcd screen with no view lens making outdoor photos challenging.I will probably give this one away and look for a Sony \"one touch\" user friendly with better indoor capabilities.", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worst indoor video and pics!!!", "Author": "Michael Countryman \"mike the camera man\"", "ReviewID": "R1MP5XFP1EJXCA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ok I am being harsh on this one since of all the cameras I have ever owned this is the most disapointing.It does do nice video and pics outdoors.Indoors forget it. Very, very grainy video and pics.The flash is way underpowred.Best for use as a outdoor point and shoot camera only.The files for the HD video are very large and fill up that hard drive fast.Now as far as size it is very small and feels solid in your hads but because it is metal it sweets in your hand quickly!There are many other cameras that do a much better job for about the same price or less. Look at aiptek a-hd or go-hd if you want good pics and video plus much less money. Please note: that they both have much better video and pics indoors. But the subjects will need to be somewhat still or they may blur.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great pictures and zoom", "Author": "Giovanni Fortezza \"giovannif\"", "ReviewID": "R2TC7NNSVX1G04", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have not yet tried video because i was waiting to receive my 8GB SDHC card.
