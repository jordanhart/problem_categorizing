{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works Great With Windows 7 64bit", "Author": "Lea Nicodemus", "ReviewID": "R37JITFMBBJ4P1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not a cheesy DVR. Construction and materials look and feel top notch. I set up a small camera system for my home, (3 cameras). I had no problems getting the software to work with windows 7. When I plugged in the USB connector, at first my computer did not recognize the devise, it said \"unknown devise\" or something to that effect. After restarting and plugging it back in, then my computer saw the devise as \"QQDVR\" and windows installed the drivers for me. I tried other DVRs in the past, like the one from Sharx Security that installs into a PCI slot and had to return it because it was not compatible with Windows 7. This one works great with windows 7. Other great features include 4 channels video with their own audio jacks, so 4 channels audio/video (4 BNC Video jacks,4 Audio RCA jacks). Frame rates are great even with all three cameras running. Cameras are independently fully adjustable. Setting up the remote surveillance feature was easy and I was able to monitor my property as well as motion record while I was on vacation 1100mi away from home. I was able to monitor from my laptop at the hotel I was staying in. This DVR takes up no space in my computer case allowing my computer to run cooler because there is no warm/hot, air blocking PCI card in my PCI slot. This would also be a great product for someone who wants to use it with their laptop. Note: When you configure the software, you will be asked what signal type your cameras are, your choices are \"PAL\" and \"NTSC\", if you are in the United States choose \"NTSC\". Don't select \"PAL\" I did this by mistake and I had no signal. Also, if you put your computer into \"sleep mode\", that will disable the DVR software temporarily until you do a restart and open the program again. When I record, I disable my \"sleep\" function. If you get confused installing the QQDVR, someone posted a video on YouTube explaining the install.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth a Try?", "Author": "MonteC", "ReviewID": "R1YWPERGXXJMU6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, I thought this was going to work, but I keep having problems getting more than one camera to work at a time, and the program could be more user friendly. I can't get it to minimize and then come back to full screen, which means I can't use my computer for anything else once I launch the program. I've been working with computers since 1980, and have used DVR security devices for over 10 years, but all I can say is that you get what you pay for. If anyone else has had experience with this USB DVR device, I would love to hear from you.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$42.95", "Features": "4 Channel Super USB DVR Video & Audio Real-time Network CCTV Capture Card 120FPS\nFeatures 4-channel video input and 4-channel audio input in one card, allows you to watch 4 different video displays on one screen\nCompatible with Windows 2000 / XP / Vista /7 (32 &64Bit)\n4 channel video input on one card.
