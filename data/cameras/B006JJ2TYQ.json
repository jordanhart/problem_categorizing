It is nearly identical to the one that came with my follow focus.  It does what it is designed to do- mesh with industry standard follow focus gears.  The tension mechanism works as expected and the gear ration was correct.If you have a high end follow focus, I would recommend you buy the focus ring that is specifically manufactured for that product, but if you're using low end gear, this will probably work just fine, and if it doesn't, Amazon's return policy will resolve things for you.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$9.45", "Features": "Camera Debugged Focus Ring", "Name": "Camera Debugged Focus Ring", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31cpy2kJRvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006JJ2TYQ"}}
