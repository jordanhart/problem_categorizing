{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very happy with this camera", "Author": "Greg Sumner", "ReviewID": "R1GXVFM45WT63F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is our 5th point n' shoot camera over the years, intended for go-everywhere pocketability.  Our previous two pocket cameras were Canon's (SD300 and SD600).  The Sony is a little bigger but improves on them greatly.The Sony DSC-W370 operates under the premise that people want the camera to be easy.  Not just easy but dead simple.  So much so that it includes an \"easy mode\" and \"smile sensor\" to automatically take the shot when the camera sees a smile.  All of the advanced controls are hidden, although easy to get to if you want them.What mattered most to us:- Speed.  The camera starts up, focuses, zooms and shoots very quickly.  The auto-mode, which we use most of the time, is very smart.  I haven't been able to fool it yet.- Easy.  You really don't need to do anything but keep the camera in Intelligent Auto mode.  It will surmise what you're trying to shoot and pick the right mode quickly.  My 5 year old took some photos today, he could use the camera with no instruction.- SD/SDHC memory card.  Sony finally quit trying to lock us into their memory sticks.- HD movies.  We used the movie mode in the Canons more than we ever thought we would.  So this time 720p movies was important.- High quality.  At any zoom length the shots are crisp.  I tested Fuji, Olympus, Canon and Nikon at the same price range - the Sony beat them all.Negatives -Only a few and they're minor.  The zoom buttons are smallish, and it's easy to go past 7x optical zoom and right into digital zoom, which as a rule I don't use.  You are able to disable digital zoom.  I also disabled the musical menu jingles.  You will too I bet.There are very few available buttons on the rear of the camera.  This was obviously deliberate - this is supposed to be an Easy camera.  But the buttons are smallish and the wheel is also rather small.  There are only a few dedicated keys and they're for the most basic of functions - flash, screen brightness and smile mode.  That's it.If you're an advanced photographer and you want quick access to functions like ISO, EV or shooting modes then this camera may not be for you.  Those functions ARE available with a few more key presses.Smile Mode seems silly to me.  The camera can be set to automatically take the shot when it detects a smile.  I can tell when somebody is smiling, although to be fair the Sony might actually be better at it than a human is.  I haven't tested this yet.I wasn't able to test the Panasonic ZS3, the W370's closest competitor.  At the time I purchased the ZS3 was a full (...) more expensive, but they'll probably drop the price now that this Sony is out.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "A KEEPER: Almost Returned it after Reading Reviews", "Author": "T. Swanson", "ReviewID": "R345W1R7CCB443", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While out in the desert I dropped my Canon SD870 for about the third time in 3 years on a rock and the mirco-gears were no longer in alignment--camera would no longer focus at all. I was heading out on a week trip to extremely remote areas so I needed to buy a camera in one day to take with me. Not having a lot of good value options, I settled on this model and then came home and read the reviews. It was too late to take the camera back and get another one, so I had to live with this choice. So I read the manual and experimented by taking pictures around my house. The following are my thought after using the camera for a few weeks on different trips.SPEED: Since I am an electrical engineer, it did not long to discover that all of the intelligent smile, red eye and other detection algorithms were taking a lot of processing time slowing down the camera. After turning them all off the seed improved a lot. Next I put in a 4GB Sandisk Class 6 SD memory card and that helped some more. In fact the speed to take still shots was about the same as my old Canon. However, when using the flash it does take about 2-3 seconds to recharge and be ready for taking the next photo, but I can live with that. The camera automatically uses the flash outside more than I like, so I turned it off and it the camera operated faster. All of the intelligent detection algorithms really slow down the camera. With all of them shut off the camera is ready to take a picture in about 1-2 seconds depending on the resolution of the picture your taking. That is about 1 second for a 5M versus 2 seconds for 14.1M of resolution. That is just the time it takes to write the image to the SD card. If you get the class 10 SD cards I am guessing it will be closer to 1 second to write the image to memory.BATTERY LIFE: There are different modes you can set the camera to operate that control the amount of current used to operate. Because of all of the bad reviews, I set it to the \"Stamina\" mode as I was going to be away from power sources to recharge the battery and was planning to take lot of pictures. On a trip to Chevelon Canyon to take pictures of Petroglyphs I used it continuously for 3 hours and took 291 5M resolution pictures. I turned it on and off about 50 times that day and after doing this for about 3.5 hours and 291 images later, the battery showed 2 of the 4 bars of still available battery life. I turned it on the next day and took another 100 images and there was still one bar of battery life available. I did not use the flash for any of these pictures. Using it the way I did, would allow taking 400-500 5M resolution pictures which is more than I got with my Canon.BATTERY CHARGING: My canon took about 30 -45 minutes to charge, but I now think it used a higher current than the Sony and so it gives a quicker, but not as deep of a charge. It was shocking to learn the Sony took about 3 hours to charge. It must be a low current slow charge method which usually makes batteries last longer and hold their charge better.PICTURE QUALITY: I am not a professional, but people have told me I take good pictures. With that in mind I could not see distortion around the edges and corners as I read in other reviews. Maybe some or one of the auto detection algorithms does compensation that messes up the images? With the camera setup in a minimal auto mode as described above, the pictures I have take are of the same quality as those I took with my SD870--VERY GOOD!WIDE ANGLE LENS: It does not have the digital zoom lens feature the SD 870 does and it is fantastic compared to the fixed zoom of the W370, and the wide angle is not as wide, but if you move closer or further back a few feet it gets the job done. When your truing to take a picture of a cliff dwelling located on a ledge that is difficult to get closer to, digital zoom is missed.PHOTO EDITING SOFTWARE: It comes with a reduced function NERO photo editor. They only allow certain functions to get you to buy the package. NERO will not even allow a person to delete a photo from their computer unless they buy the upgrade. Well you can go to where your photos are stored and delete them yourself or just use a good inexpensive photo editor and forget using NERO.  I tested the results of the NERO editor against the FREE editing capability in PICASA (free by Google online) and I could not see any difference. I just transfer the images and then use an editor to do the croping, etc.CONSTRUCTION: I checked out a couple of the canon model for a similar price and they weighted about half as much as the W370 and did not feel like they were built very solidly. This camera is as sturdy as my old SD870. While taking pictures the first day I had to jump from rock to rock over a flowing creek and when I landed on the far side the camera went flying and landed on a large flat & smooth boulder and slide about 6 feet before stopping. I cringed as I picked up the camera hoping at least the pictures were good, since it was such a remote place. After trying the camera it worked fine and I have not found any negative issues with it since. It is a rugged well built camera.REVIEWERS: I think reviewers often do not read the manual and therefore do not set things up correctly, work for the competition or work for the manufacturer and so there can be a lot of dis-information to sift through. The middle ground reviewers are probably most accurate (LOL)?OVERALL: This camera is solidly built, has a large 3\" diagonal viewer that is easy to read, takes good pictures and a lot of them with one battery when the auto detection features are turned off. It is just what I need and a good value in my opinion for the price. Now, if I had to buy a camera again and had two weeks to get it, know what I now know, I would buy it again.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "the-movie-guy \"movie and electonics buff\"", "ReviewID": "RJUQTGB14673K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me say, I've owned several Sony digital cameras over the years. First a DSC-P50 circa 2001, then a couple of random ones I purchased new and wound up selling because they had poor picture quality. Then in 2005 I purchased a Sony DSC-W7 (7.2 mp) point-and-shoot. This is a good little camera but the PQ has always been a little hit and miss. I would say I got one or two good shots out of every 100.Some problems with the W7 were autofocus that didn't focus properly (especially in indoor, low-light conditions), redeye was pervasive (even with the redeye reduction feature turned on), and shutter lag time. (One feature I liked about the W7 was the inclusion of an optical viewfinder, which it seems most of the manufacturers have now abandoned on these small digital cameras.)Most of these problems seem to be addressed with the newest (2010) generation of Sony DSC point-and-shoots. I decided this was the time to replace the W7, and it came down to a choice between a DSC-W330 and DSC-W370. After taking some test photos in the store, and sending those photos to my personal computer at home for analysis, I decided to purchase the W370.The W370 does not have an optical viewfinder, but it has everything else, and does everything right. The low-light, indoor shooting that the W7 could not handle is not an issue at all for the W370. Each indoor shot has been clear and well-focused, with exquisite background detail in shot after shot. In 10 test shots, only 1 came out bad, whereas with previous Sonys there might be 4 good shots and 6 bad.The quality is light years ahead of the W330. I was attracted initially to the W330 because of its sleek look and small form factor (the W370 does not have this sex appeal), but the W370 blew the 330 out of the water in terms of photo quality, especially autofocus (always sharp) and redeye reduction (no redeye or hint of redeye at all in shot after shot).In sum, I purchased the W370 and haven't looked back. This is an excellent little camera and everything a digital camera should be. Takes excellent photos whether indoors or out, natural light or artificial, bright conditions or low, etc. I highly recommend this product.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "High Hopes......dashed...", "Author": "Tone Loc \"Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R2OWS0U2SJF6UC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking for a point and shoot upgrade to my old DSC-W50 which I loved and took many, many great pictures with. I heard that this model was coming out soon so I waited about a month for it to go on sale. Most of Sony's other similar models before this one had been reviewed well so I thought, better zoom, HD video, 3.0 in screen, priced under $250, should be a \"can't lose\" situation.Well I was wrong.The camera itself is impressive as all of the above is true, however, it's seriously lacking in the most important thing. Picture Quality. I used the camera for a couple weeks at a few social events where lighting wasnt perfect (translation = indoors). I guess the problem is that this camera is geared towards being easy to use, \"intelligent auto focus\". Well it's not that intelligent. I constantly found myself having to try to trick the camera and adjusting all the settings possible. But the truth is that who has that kind of time when you're in the moment? Remember the old saying \"A Kodak Moment\"?  Well it's more like a frustrated moment. It also took a while to write to my memory card (Sony ProDuo) in a couple shooting modes. For certain scenarios with good lighting or up close where the flash can do it's work you should be fine. But now a days I expect a lot more from a camera. Especially in this price range.  The video noise mentioned in other reviews is true. I didnt notice any battery problems as mentioned in other reviews.To be fair, here is The Good:  The panorama feature is absolutely awesome. It does a good job of lining up the different shots as you pan from one side to the other.  The screen is just awesome, everyone commented on how nice that was. It is an easy camera to use as there arent much in the form of controls or options to control. And it does have a high zoom but I find it less of a strong point when the exposure lacks a clear bright picture. Being able to zoom in and out during video shooting is a plus (but a slight minus when you hear the noise during playback). HDMI out is a huge plus for viewing vid's and pics since many more people have Flatscreens now days. I purchased my HDMI mini to HDMI cable on Ebay for about $5.So I decided to return it and foot the shipping costs. I then researched like crazy and visited BestBuy and Frys at least 4 or 5 times and found that sadly, there werent any cameras that really made me feel that much better about returning my W370. Most of the comparable cameras at least in regards to the features of the W370, cost $300+. They all seem to have flaws. So instead I decided to make the jump to the \"Advanced Point and Shoot\" category. They're not as sleek or pocket friendly but you really do get your money's worth when it comes to picture quality and options. In case anyone cares, I went with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35 12.1MP Digital Camera with 18x POWER Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD and I'm extremely pleased with it so far.If you need that one camera to last you a couple years, this is probably not the right one. If you happen to have money to spend on a slick looking camera that will perform well enough at least some of the time, some of the features here make it worth at least that.

I didn't have it long enough to really check everything out, all I know is that the picture quality was horrible!  That crystal clear wow factor that I had anticipated was beaten back into the pipe dream it came from... the picture quality was better outdoors (high light), but still not acceptable!  After three days of wasted vacation photos, I called to get my return authorization number!  The only real difference that I can come up with (that would lead to the picture quality being so much worse than the 220) was the fact that this model does NOT have the Carl Zeiss lens???

The still pictures look great, the panoramic sweep mode I like but just like the 3 other reviewers, I am so disappointed with the audio during video playback.  The audio is ok if there is no other sound interference nearby but if you video record while in a moving car or a plane, the sound is totally useless, so distorted, unless the camera has a setting to correct this. I have a DSC H7 and I think it has the same still picture quality but the sound recording is definately distortion free.  I recorded a video while we are on a single engine 4 seater cessna and the sound quality is good.  Engine noise of a plane versus engine noise of a car.  This is where I am disappointed, thinking if you buy a newer camera, it is an improvement of their older model.Update:  After chatting with Sony's product support they told me to \"initialize\" (click on menu then scroll down until you see the briefcase icon, then click on it and after scrolling down some more you will see \"initialize\"), its like re-formatting the camera back to factory specs.  Initialized my camera and now the mic sounds better, not as sensitive as before.  Video recording in a moving vehicle is still distorted but not as much. Just lower the volume of your video player. I surrender and reality has sunk in. Now I give it a 4  from 3 stars :-)and am gonna try to look for another small video camera for HD videos.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "THE NEED FOR SPEEEEED!", "Author": "James Keener", "ReviewID": "R32YG6WODWKQ56", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I broke my own rule when I bought this camera - I bought it on impulse without doing my usual research.  I've had some great Sony cameras before and I was impressed when I saw the features of the DSC-W370.  Just the improvements I was looking for, at a very reasonable price, so I pushed the button.  The problem arose when I got it home, unpacked it and pushed another button - the shutter button.  In bright indoor light, with a large sliding glass patio door opposite me, I tried a picture of my canine companion.  After pushing the button, I probably could have gotten myself a cup of coffee while waiting for the shutter to actually activate. (Yes, I'm exaggerating.) But the lag time was incredible, totally unacceptable.  Outside, it's a little better, but not by much.  Sorry, but that's a deal breaker for me.  Like the other reviewer, I also considered whether my camera was just a lemon, but then I finally did what I should have done before making the purchase.  I went online and read some reviews, and all the professional reviewers downrated the 370 because of its long shutter lag.I can't comment on the other features of this camera, because I didn't keep it long enough to make any judgements on them.  All I can say is, if you expect to do any sports action shooting, or catching your dog, kids, or grandkids in that oh-so-cute pose, forget the 370.  It ain't gonna happen.  You'll be too late every time.One of the pro reviewers commented that Sony cut some corners on this camera in order to keep the price down.  Although I'm not a camera technician, that sounds like a reasonable assumption.  But it seems to me that they really cut the wrong corners on this one.Like the other person above, I also switched to the Sony Cybershot HX5V.  For a few bucks more, you go from 7X optical zoom to 10X higher quality lens, and more importantly you get a big improvement in speed.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Didn't meet expectations!", "Author": "Naveen M \"NM\"", "ReviewID": "R1S3IEIIPKCXIV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "W370 was compared against a Nikon Coolpix S6000 as the specifications for both cameras match very closely.

I should have bought a PS3 with that money!The picture quality is horrible. Especially when a picture is taken indoors. The colors mesh together and it almost looks like a watercolor painting. The detail in pictures are lost, and it's impossible to restore them again. Even when using Photoshop. The time between pictures lag horribly. I took this camera to an alumni football game and I regret it. Taking pictures of my friends was just hard. The camera would focus on whatever was floating in the air, the camera would take forever trying to take a picture that by the time it took the picture it would be nothing because my friends would be in another spot (and this is actually using the sport feature!).The video quality SUCKS. Even when you are outside in the brightest day in Florida this camera would somehow, someway find a way to get out of focus and pretty much stay that way. Sometimes even zooming in and out doesn't help. There is also a clicking noise in the background that makes it annoying to even watch a video or even listen to it. When this camera does FINALLY focus, the colors are amazing and the sound is pretty good. But that's only when the camera finally decides to cooperate.The panoramic pictures are horrible. The fact that it took its own panoramic photos was interesting, but not worth the money. The quality of these pictures are terrible and sometimes aren't even stitched correctly. Don't even think about shining the camera toward bright light when on the panoramic setting. It would literally stop and say \"Cannot take picture\", so I advise anyone buying this camera to not take a panoramic picture on the beach. Because it won't work unless it's on the most cloudy day.In summary, this camera is terrible and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. The camera is just crap and lags way to much to take a decent photo in action. The video quality can't stay in focus and the panoramic setting isn't all it's hyped up to be.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Entry level Point and Shoot", "Author": "George Morris", "ReviewID": "R2ON732XC8SUFU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The good: Simple to operate; 7x zoom lens in a compact body; inexpensive for its general specifications.The bad: Long shutter lag; mediocre low-light photos; lower-end components.The bottom line: Sony's Cyber-shot DSC-W370 is an inexpensive compact camera with a long lens; however, its shutter lag and low-light photo quality keep it from earning a higher rating.Review:On the surface, the specs-to-price ratio of the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W370 is excellent. It has a 14-megapixel resolution, a 7x zoom lens, a 3-inch LCD, supports 720p HD movie capture, and has an HDMI output for quickly connecting to an HDTV--all for less than $230. The W370 is sort of the update to 2009's overall excellent W290; however, the model actually has more in common with the 2010 W350.On the surface, the specs-to-price ratio of the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W370 is excellent.

The W370 is sort of the update to 2009's overall excellent W290; however, the model actually has more in common with the 2010 W350.The \"on the surface\" qualifier is because it's not immediately apparent where Sony cut corners to get the price low. For example, Sony has three classes of lenses; from lowest-end to highest, it's Sony, Carl Zeiss, and Sony G. The W370 has a Sony lens--and not terribly wide one, if that matters to you. This camera also doesn't use Sony's Bionz image processor, which helps explain the increased image noise at higher ISO sensitivities and its slow shooting performance. If you're after a Sony compact with very good photos and shooting performance, go with the W350. If you're in love with the idea of a reasonably priced camera with a 7x optical zoom in a compact body, the W370 is worth checking out, but it's not without sacrifice.Key specs Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W370Dimensions (WHD) 3.9x2.2x1 inchesWeight (with battery and media) 6.3 ouncesMegapixels, image sensor size, type 14 megapixels, 1/2.3-inch CCDLCD size, resolution/viewfinder 3-inch LCD, 230K dots/NoneLens (zoom, aperture, focal length) 7x, f3.6-5.6, 34-238mm (35mm equivalent)File format (still/video) JPEG/MPEG-4 (.MP4)Highest resolution size (still/video) 4,320x3,240 pixels/1,280x720 at 29.97fps (progressive)Image stabilization type Optical and digitalBattery type, CIPA rated life Lithium ion rechargeable, 230 shotsBattery charged in camera No, external charger suppliedStorage media Memory Stick Pro Duo, SD, SDHCBundled software Picture Motion Browser 5.0 (Windows), PMB Portable 1.1 (Windows, Mac)The camera is available in silver--actually more of gun-metal gray; red; and green versions, all have chrome trim on the top and right side, and the W370's body is compact enough to squeeze in most pants pockets or handbags. The 7x lens adds some weight to the package, so you probably won't forget that you have the camera with you. The camera's body is metal and a bit too slippery to securely use one-handed; there is a slight bump out on the right front, but not enough to make a difference. If you've ever hesitated to buy a Sony camera because its devices use Memory Stick media, you will be pleased that the 2010 Cyber-shots accept SD and SDHC cards as well as Memory Sticks. On the right side of the body is a flip-open door that hides a Micro-USB/AV port and a Mini-HDMI port.The card slot and battery compartment are protected by a door that doesn't lock and slides open easily; something to keep in mind if you're going to keep it loose in a bag. The camera's battery life is average for its class, but that's actually pretty short and the pack must be removed to charge it. Though internal memory is limited, it does host a small piece of software for quickly uploading photos and movies to sharing sites when the camera is connected to a Windows or Mac computer.The W370's controls are straightforward. On its top are the power and shutter release buttons. The power button is flush with the body and, though easily pressed, it'll require most users to look to locate it. The remaining controls are on back to the right of the LCD, which was barely bright enough to use in sunny conditions. A zoom rocker that some people may find finicky sits at the top and below it is the shooting mode dial. Playback, Menu, Delete, and a circular directional pad handle all other tasks. In addition to navigating menus, the directional pad can change flash and timer functions, change display information, and activate smile detection. Sony's menu systems remain fairly logical and uncomplicated compared with its cameras prior to 2009's interface changes. Out of the box, it's simple enough to master its controls after a little use.General shooting options Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W370ISO sensitivity (full resolution) Auto, 80, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1,600, 3,200White balance Auto, Daylight, Cloudy, Fluorescent white, Fluorescent natural white, Fluorescent day white, Incandescent, Flash, CustomRecording modes Easy, Intelligent Auto, Program, Sweep Panorama, Scene, MovieFocus modes Multi AF, Center AF, Spot AF, Face Detection (Adult, Child)Metering modes Multi, Center-weighted average, SpotColor effects NoneBurst mode shot limit (full resolution) Up to 100 photosThe W370 is well-suited for snapshot photography, and people who like a lot of control shouldn't consider buying it. That's not to say this Sony doesn't give you some control; the Program Auto lets you adjust ISO, white balance, autofocus points, light metering, and exposure values as well as control the amount of Sony's Dynamic Range Optimization used for rescuing shadow detail. Its Intelligent Auto scene recognition mode turns out reasonably reliable results without any adjustments, but there are still a couple options available to you like exposure and setting face detection priorities. An Easy mode takes away all options except for image size (large or small) and enlarges onscreen text. There are 10 scene shooting options including High Sensitivity, Beach, Snow, Food, and Pet. There's a version of Sony's Sweep Panorama feature, too, that let you quickly and easily take panoramic shots horizontally or vertically. While fun, the results just aren't as good as those taken with Sony's Exmor R-based models such as the WX1 and HX5V. Consider them for Web use only or very small prints. Lastly, the Movie mode records at resolutions up to 720p HD with a mono mic for audio.Overall, the W370's shooting performance is average for its class, with its biggest issue being shutter lag. The time from off to first shot is an OK 2.3 seconds. Its shot-to-shot times averaged 1.9 seconds without flash and 4.2 seconds with flash. Its full-resolution continuous shooting mode is good for this category of camera at 1.3 frames per second. However, the W370's shutter lag--how quickly the camera captures an image after the shutter-release button is pressed--is poor at 0.8 second in bright conditions and 1.6 seconds in low light. If you're considering the W370 for capturing moving subjects, you'll likely be disappointed. However, with some practice and the continuous shooting mode, you might get lucky.The W370's photo quality is good to very good, losing points because its low-light quality isn't as good as the less expensive W350's is. In the ISO 80-200 range, photos you take with the camera look better than expected for its features and price. However, if you view them at 100 percent, the pictures have a decidedly digital look to them and might appear soft and lack fine detail. Photo prints at 8x10 inches or smaller looked nice, natural, and relatively sharp. Even larger prints up to 13x19 inches are fine as long as you're not overly critical on image quality. Higher ISO photos--those at and above ISO 400--are where this camera falls apart in comparison to the W350. The W350's color performance was consistent from ISO 80 to 3,200 and while its noise suppression made subjects look painterly, the photos were still usable for small prints when sensitivities above ISO 400 were used. With the W370, these higher ISOs yield poor results with noticeable shifts in color and a lot of noise.Ideally, a 14-megapixel resolution should buy you a fair amount room for cutting down your images. If you're one to crop in a lot on subjects and then want to create 13x19-inch prints, you probably won't be happy with this camera--or any other current sub-$230 compact.Despite not having a wide-angle lens, the W370's images have some barrel distortion when taken at the lens' widest position. Having a slight pincushion distortion when the lens is extended is common, but there was no sign of it from the W370. The camera's center sharpness is pretty good, though my test camera is softer on the left side, particularly in the upper corner. The amount of fringing around high-contrast subjects is average to above average for its class. At small sizes, it's easy to overlook, but anything larger than a 4x6, and your eye will likely be drawn to it.The W370's color performance is very good and reasonably accurate. Reds tended to look oversaturated, but otherwise subjects looked bright and natural. The camera's exposure is generally good, but blown highlights are frequent. Its white balance is also good.The camera's video quality is respectable, too, on par with an HD minicamcorder. You can use the 7x zoom while you're recording, but the lens movement is jerky and you will hear the lens motor on your recordings--though this is common for compact cameras.The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W370 is a decent camera for those interested in getting the most specs for the least money. However, Sony makes trade-offs to get the low price such as using its lowest-quality lens and a less capable image processor than its Bionz Engine. As is the case with most models in its class, the W370 is at its best in bright conditions for portraits and landscapes. Regardless of the resolution stamped on its body, the photos will generally not be great viewed at their full size from a foot away on your computer screen. However, they will look fine on prints at 8x10 inches or smaller, when viewed on a TV from a proper distance or when viewed on your favorite photo-sharing site.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "didn't like it at all", "Author": "subu", "ReviewID": "R2CDOCYIQX3OPT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Looks and feels nice, great zoom but, picture quality is bad.... 1 out of 3 pictures comes blurry...even if you move for a second after clicking you got a bad picture.

Not paper thin, but good for my purposesExpandable Memory - a big plus in my book that it accepts SDHC cards.Lion Battery - the battery lasts longer than any other camera I've owned, so much improvement for me.Photo Modes: WOW - I'm still learning all the options here. The Panoramic mode is AWESOME & Easy.Large LCD screen - very niceAutofocus & Image stablization - I can use all the help I can get.CONS:Autofocus goes crazy in Movie Mode - this is the most annoying aspect of the camera. The camera is constantly trying to refocus and as a result, the image is often mostly blurry. This is most notable in low light conditions, or when you move the camera. there appears no way to turn this off.  Regular Camcorders are able to autofocus without causing anywhere near the level of blurring that this camera produces. It's like the autofocus can't lock on to the overall image to keep it in focus but is trying to lock on to specific objects. It is so very annoying and pretty much makes this camera useless for video.Autofocus is slow - when taking a regular still, the camera takes way too long to focus.Long lag time between shutter button push and picture taking - I think this is related to the slow autofocus.The door covering the battery and SD Card slots is cheaply constructed. The door could very easily break off. There is also a small spring loaded plasitc blue retaining latch that keeps the battery in place. This too could easily break if not careful when changing batteries.The plastic door covering the USB & HDMI ports is also flimsy and cheaply constructed. Could easily break if not careful. I never use the built in USB or HDMI, so this is not a big issue for me as I never open the door.+++++Overall, the camera is good as a still camera with some nice features. I typally import the pics to my PC directly from the SD card rather than hooking the camera up to USB. I guess its a matter of preference.  I do worry though everytime I have to open the door cover to the are where the SD Card and Battery reside - like I said, the door is rather cheap and could break off if not careful.I wish I had looked further before buying this camera.  I'm rather disappointed overall. I was looking for a replacement for my Nikon Coolpix still camera and my Flip Camcorder, and hoped the Sony DSC-W370 would be it. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close to what my Flip ULTRA HD can do.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful pics but some major dislikes!", "Author": "CharlieCom", "ReviewID": "R1TJOWE7TCQPOP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off... I've had several Kodaks including their 14 megapixel Z1485 and Z1285 cameras. The Sony DSC-W370 doesn't just take better pictures, it absolutely excels over the Kodaks.The DSC-W370 takes better pictures than any camera I ever owned. Taking a picture of a doorknob two houses down the street, the DSC370 could clearly see scratches on the door surrounding the doorknob. The best the Kodaks could do was a blurry doorknob and blurry scratches -- course it was a ways off, but where the Sony excelled, the Kodaks failed to produce clear images (the Sony has an excellent lens).The Sony also has a powerful flash. It doesn't just light up a little area right in front of the camera, it lights up the entire living room. I was more than pleased with the flash.----Now then, the Sony DSC-370 has enough cons that I ended up selling it:1. It's slow to auto-focus. And once an item is focused, give it a few seconds and it automatically goes out of focus and then has to focus again.2. The sweep panorama mode is great. However, if anything moves while you're panning the shot, you get multiple images. For example, a man sitting in a chair moved slightly while I was panning the shot -- and in the panorama picture he showed up with three legs.In another picture, a car was moving during the panorama sweep. In the final picture you saw the same nose of the car about a half dozen times.  (comparing Kodaks -- Kodaks take panoramas by combining side-by-side \"still\" shots into one panorama image. It's more work, but at least you don't get three legged people)3. Movie mode is where the Sony DSC-370 is at its worst. Setting the camera on a stationary desktop and taking a movie of a dance floor, the camera went in and out of focus about every thirty seconds. And it doesn't just go out of focus, it's slow to get back in focus.The problem in movie mode is that most camera functions, such as manual focus, don't work in movie mode. So there's nothing you can do about the camera going in and out of focus during movie mode.Sound recording is also a disaster in movie mode. The auto sound level records so loud that nearly every recorded sound distorts. I recorded a \"not so loud\" live band at a senior citizens dinner. The music came out terrible because it recorded so loud that it distorted. And if you talk while making a movie, the recorded sound is so loud that it practically blows out your speakers on playback.The auto sound record levels are just too loud -- and you can't do anything about it because there's no \"manual\" sound record revel option. On the other hand, I haven't seen that feature on anything less than outright professional cameras. Even so, most cameras do a fair job of recording sound in movies, but I can't recommend the Sony DSC-370 because of the sound distortion.Conclusion: In my opinion, even in auto mode, the Sony DSC-370 usually takes outstanding and professional quality pictures. It's a bit slow to focus, but it takes the best pictures of any camera I've ever used. I like the camera, but I wouldn't recommend it for taking movies (use a good camcorder if you want movies).", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "pretty great camera for a reasonable price", "Author": "chris", "ReviewID": "R37YW2WXHEPO92", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because we didn't want to take our bigger video camera on vacation with us and I wanted a relatively simple point and click, user friendly camera that would almost always take wonderful photos.

The battery life is decent, it lasted at least 8 hours for me but given that I wasn't taking constant photos I would've expected it to last longer. It can be hard to see the LCD in bright sun but from what I'm told this is common on most comparable cameras and it wasn't much of a problem.  Also, there is a delay between snapping the photo and seeing it which may be normal or perhaps I need to learn more about settings to adjust that.

We tried changing everything and it didn't matter what we did. We even took a video of a picture on the wall to see if it was the movement but nope, still continued to refocus.  As for the pictures, the quality was nice but like others have stated, the time it takes to get the darn thing to take a picture is worthless, especially if you are photographing children. We needed a camera that would quickly take a picture when we hit the button but it waits and waits and by the time it takes the pic, the kids are off to the next thing or done smiling. We tried the burst option and that's awful too. The time between pictures is much too long so the person is out of the frame by the time the second picture is taken.

It takes a couple seconds to turn on & be \"ready.\" The lag time between pushing the shutter button and the camera being auto-intelligent to take the photo was MUCH too long. A few times I thought maybe I hadn't pushed it in hard enough after pressing halfway to focus, so I'd move the camera to look at it & it would finally fire. (literally 2 seconds after pushing)My main reason for purchase was as a second camera to my DSLR. One that I could drop into my diaper bag & pull out on a moment's notice to catch my cute little toddler in action. My performance standards are realistic. I don't expect DSLR quality...but I DID expect quality that at least matched my 5 year-old, old point & shoot camera. By the time I got this one on & the photo taken, my toddler was off to the next thing and just a blur in the corner of my photo.The video was also a major disappointment. I thought the image stabilization seemed pretty non-existent. I took videos of my son in the bathtub w/ 2 overhead lights on (bright room) and the camera took up to 10 seconds to focus after pressing halfway & then record. Midway through the minute long video, it lost focus for several more seconds. I was still standing about 6' from the tub and had not zoomed/moved camera. My 2nd attempt at video was of a singer on stage - dimly lit - and the video and audio went out of synch about 10 seconds into the video & got progressively worse as I continued to film. The microphone is on the top left edge of camera & I admit, I may've been holding it incorrectly (in the dark) for best output...but that shouldn't have caused the synch issue, just the crackly static!While this was definitely not the camera for me, I did really like the panoramic feature.

It basically cuts the top and bottom off and ends up using 11 MP, but considering most things are in 16:9, I find this extremely useful), and physically it's pretty light and small.the main thing that people are complaining about is the autofocus, which is admittedly little tricky:there is absolutely no manual focus available. So you have to move the camera around and/or wait for the right focus to occur (doesn't take more than a few seconds even when you're trying to take weirdly focused pictures. Usually takes ~1 second or less since it's always trying to correct for best focus possible) So it's not that big of a deal once you get the hang of it.*I do NOT use this camera for professional photos but I do like to think that some of the pictures I got with this camera are on the same level.Overall, recommend it.UPDATE: 4 Months after purchase:+ Have taken 5,000+ pictures and 100+ videos.+ I do not use the software that comes with the camera, at all. I use integrated SD Card reader of my laptop and is very convenient.- The camera has developed a serious problem: if I have it set on either mode P, Panoramic, or Video, it randomly jumps between the 3 (without the dial turning). and I have to reset the mode (switch dial to something else and come back to what I want). This happens roughly once every 10-20 shots.- The battery has not yet gone dead but that was a result of restricting the use of camera and is a hassle. Usually lasts about 250 pictures.- The camera also has lag at times. Looks like the more settings you have turned on, (face detection, smile detection, red eye correction, etc.), the slower the camera response time.

Arroyo", "ReviewID": "RDA6T0XI2B1AD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I feel compelled to write a review because I feel like I was led astray by the reviews that are out there, now.  Firstly, I should say that there aren't that many reviews for this camera (it's a new model) but I also read up on the earlier model (which received 4.5 stars, as well) and (mistakenly) decided that this must be a good camera given the all the great feedback on both models, combined. Boy was that a BAD assumption.I currently have a Canon SD that is 4-years old, has traveled around the world with me and has taken great pictures!  However, it has also been dropped several times and repaired (through the warranty) twice, and basically reached the point where it's on the last leg.  Given this - I decided it was time to get a new camera. I was torn between the Canon SD1200, the Olympus 7010 (recommended by a friend)and the Cybershot (recommended by my sister.)  The only downside to the Canon was that it does not zoom as far as the others - which I think is a great disadvantage when you're sitting at the back of the school auditorium attempting to shoot pictures of your child on stage at the front.  Reviewers of the Olympus noted that it did not take great pictures inside - another disadvantage when I'm shooting many pictures of my children in their school functions.  After talking to the sales rep at Best Buy - I determined that the Cybershot was the better camera for my simple, point and shoot needs (although a bit more expensive)and, in his opinion, a much better brand than Canon or Olympus.Imagine my disappointment when I showed up at my niece's 1st birthday party, new camera in hand, and unable to take even 1 good picture!  =(  For 3 days we shot footage of all the festivities and out of a hundred - I got less than a dozen I can actually use.  All my pictures came out blurry - regardless of the setting. The shutter speed is SO SLOW that it was IMPOSSIBLE to get a picture of someone who was in motion (and what kid is ever standing still?!?) But even asking my brother to stand perfectly still with my niece - I could barely get a shot that wasn't blurry.  We tried every setting - the only one that even turned out a halfway decent picture was if we put it on \"continuous shoot\" we'd get 1 out of the 3 that wasn't blurry.In all fairness to the camera - I will admit I did NOT read the manual.  Simply because I bought the camera on Thur night - with all intention of reading the manual on the 4-hour road trip on Friday.  Only to find out (once on the road) that the manual is not enclosed in the box - but must be accessed online.  (Great for going green - not so great for my road trip reading.)  None the less - I came home from my trip, convinced that I should read the manual, first, then decide if I was keeping the camera.  However, after further thought - I realized that if I can't even take one good picture on \"easy\" mode (and given my 4-year knowledge of basic camera shooting on my Canon) then this is certainly NOT the camera for me!  I'm not talking about messing with exposure and ISO speeds - I just want to tell the camera I'm at the beach - it's cloudy - autofocus / autoflash and shoot.Maybe I'm just naive - but this is how simple it is on the Canon that I own - so I assume other cameras will work the same.  I will be returning this camera, today. I really have no interest in giving Sony another shot - so it's back to Canon.

I dont expect any camera to survive a 4 foot fall onto a wood floor but their might be tougher cameras out there. The pictures came out great and the wide angle lens is a must. The steady shot and panoramic features are pretty cool. The 14.1MP is plenty unless you are looking to take 4 feet by 6 feet pictures.

In addition to the three inch view screen on the rear, this camera looked very sophisticated, yet trendy. Unfortunately, the picture quality never could live up to the hype.The picture quality was just awful. Let me back that bold statement up with a little bit of information. Although I am not a master of photography, I know my way around a camera. No matter which settings I chose, and no matter how much I played with the white balance, it was physically impossible for this camera to take anything better than average photos. By design, the pictures always came out flat, washed out, and lacking in any rich color whatsoever.Disregarding the picture quality, all of the other features of the camera seemed to work as promised. After spending a year of disappointment with this camera, I finally decided to give Sony one more chance. In fact, just recently I upgraded to the Sony DSC-WX10. Wow, what an improvement!At the end of the day, no matter how good a camera looks on the outside, and no matter how many bells, and whistles it has, if the camera cannot physically take good pictures, then it is not a smart investment.Overall rating is three stars out of five.

The price as well as the promise of impressive specs lured me to try this compact point and shoot. The results were disappointing. The pictures were average and some were blurry (in the short amount of time I've used it). I normally use a Sony alpha DSLR for serious photos and have also used a Nikon CoolPix L20. The photos were inferior to the Nikon and did not show as much details (the Nikon was only 10 MP). The videos were also repeatedly blurring in and out of focus (which was frustrating). The whirring noise (which was mentioned by other reviewers) was also present. The main problem may be the regular Sony lens (which is not the better Carl Zeiss lens).I also purchased a Sony Cybershot DSC-350 and will be trying it in the next few days. Upon initial assessment and using it side by side with a few pics and videos, it appears that the 350 has the upper hand, producing clearer pics and clearer videos. I will reserve judgment on the 350 until I have examined it further though I must also mention that the 350 has the better Carl Zeiss lens despite being around $50 cheaper than the 370.I will be returning this DSC-370 largely due to average quality photos and poor quality videos( My DXG HD camcorder records better videos).

It's been terrible from the beginning.  The dial on the back of the camera spins far to easy - you reach for it, and it almost always is in video mode because the dial was inadvertently spun.  Indoor photography is slow and of very poor quality.  I'm not new to cameras. I own 3 Nikon SLR's, but you always want a point and shoot for sports and lesser events and I hoped that this would be the right one, after purchasing 2 Nikons for daughter in law and husband in 2009.  I'm so disappointed that I didn't buy the Nikon.
