The end fell off the antenna and the remote control worked some of the time and then quit all together. That is the reason for the 4 star rating. On the up side the tuner stick and software work great. The unit also works great with Windows Vista Media Center. I have eliminated the TV set in my motor home and watch TV exclusively  on my laptop. I can record programs or schedule programs to be recorded, then put my laptop to sleep.  The computer will wake up and record the program. The best part is I can shrink the screen down to any size I want then set it for always on top and stick it up in the corner of the screen. I can surf the net or write a review while watching TV. As I am writing this review I have eight windows open and all is working fine. My laptop is a lower end Compaq ($500.00 range) with Windows Vista and 2 gig's of ram. If you open the box and throw the antenna and remote away you then have a 5 Star product. Changing channels is a snap, just click on the TV screen then use your number keys to select a channel.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "hauppauge customer service is non existent", "Author": "R.

Fulton", "ReviewID": "RC87L3273IG3G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hardware  When my cable provider (Comcast) announced a conversion of extended basic channels (24 to 71) to digital, I bought the Hauppauge HVR-950Q to replace my Hauppauge HVR-950, an analog only USB tuner. Picture quality with my old Hauppauge HVR-950 was fair to good on upper channels, but so noisy on lower channels that channels 2 to 7 were unwatchable. The first thing I noticed when I popped in the new HVR-950Q was a dramatic improvement in picture quality on the lower analog channels and some improvement too in upper channels. Obviously the HVR-950Q has much better noise filtering than the old HVR-950.  The quality improvement in analog channels alone is reason enough to upgrade.Temperature  A little worrying about the HVR-950Q is that the silicon inside must run pretty hot. The best way to judge this is to feel the metal ring of the cable. This tuner is powered from the computer USB port. Judging from its heat output this tuner must take most of the 2.5 watts (500 ma x 5V) that a USB port can deliver, so this tuner definitely needs its own port.Clear QAM  I knew prior to the conversion that my cable contained a large number of 'upper channels' because my large screen TV found them and displayed them with odd channel numbers like 74-3, 76-7. I initially paid little attention to them because it seemed they were mostly duplicates of lower channels, but when Comcast announced the analog to digital conversion,  I mapped them and began to suspect they were clear QAM (digital) channels. That is what they are, and they are likely to remain clear going forward because the small cable boxes (DTA's) Comcast distributes to analog customers are reportedly unable to decode encrypted channels.Software  I agree with other reviewers that the WinTV software from Hauppauge leaves a lot to be desired. Hauppauge actually has two software packages that are totally different, probably designed by separate software teams. I prefer Ver 6 which is an upgrade of the earlier Hauppauge software and features a convenient snapshot feature. However it really only works for analog channels (most the QAM channels don't display properly). It also uses about 90% of CPU capacity making other programs slow. In Ver 7 the snapshot feature (spacebar) works, but it is undocumented and saves files only in bmp format making them huge. I emailed Hauppauge customer support asking if there was a way to change the file format and never got a reply.  For receiving QAM digital and HD channels from this tuner I find the 3rd party software package BeyondTV works well. It gives an excellent picture, has a built-in program guide, and uses about 60% of the CPU capacity. It can takes a while to set up as the QAM channels need to be mapped into the standard channel numbers. You need the latest version of BeyondTV to get QAM channels, but upgrades from any version 4 are free.Comcast lack of support for computer TV tuners  During the digital transition period I found Comcast provided no support at all to those with computer TV tuners. Comcast never tells you (in literature or online) that there are 60-80 'hidden' clear QAM clear channels, including HD channels, on your cable that can be picked up with non-Comcast equipment. I talked to three Comcast service technicians and not one would confirm the existence of dozens of clear QAM channels on the cable.Comcast will not tell you about clear QAM channels  The HVR-950Q and most newer TVs if provided with a direct cable connection can provide access to the HD channels that are there. In contrast the equipment Comcast provides (for free) to support its analog customers in the transition to digital is low end, non-HD equipment, which if hooked up as Comcast recommends, blocks access to HD. My guess is that this is by design. Wikipedia in 'QAM tuner' notes, \"The law does not require the cable provider to advertise the availability (of clear QAM channels), and the cable customer service representatives are known to unequivocally (and incorrectly) insist to customers that (an HD) converter box is mandatory to view any HD channels.\"-----------------(update) A day or two after the extended basic analog channels were taken down I found 40 or so 'upper channels' (channel numbers like 76-9, 77-4) had gone missing. Whoops, I thought I was going to eat my words about clear QAM channels remaining on Comcast, but false alarm, they all still there just at new frequencies. A week or so after the extended basic analog channels were taken down, auto scan on both this tuner and my large screen TV is finding 87 clear QAM channels (about 70 of the 87 are new channels).  I pay Comcast well over 1,000 dollars a year in cable fees, and their idea of customer service is hide the fact that there are 87 unencrypted digital channels on my cable, many of which are HD, that I can legally access with non-Comcast equipment and without signing up for Comcast digital service!", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great tuner/ recorder", "Author": "Hugh Long", "ReviewID": "R1N555SBO4TV9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great tuner/ video recorder.

Pritchard", "ReviewID": "R1029I98NRZ0ND", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My review was mysteriously never posted the first time, hmm... trying again.I've seen reviews on other sites that say if it didn't work the person just didn't know what they were doing.  I'm a system administrator, not just a typical user, so trust me when I say I tried everything I could think of to get this to work on 3 different machines.  The first machine I tried was Win7 64-bit, 1 gig ATI graphics card (with latest drivers), and 6 gigs of ram.  I tried installing using the CD and the updated software on the website - which at the time was 1.2b, 1.2c came out after I had initiated the return.  I also tried just plugging it in and hoping Windows Media Center would detect it like I saw in other reviews - no luck.  Using the vendors software, it froze when searching for channels.  I even left it on over night (8+ hrs) thinking I didn't give it enough time, but it didn't matter.  Each time I tried a different way of installing it I used the cleaning utility on the CD to start from scratch.The second computer I tried was Windows XP Pro, 512mb nvidia graphics card (latest drivers), 2 gigs of ram.  I had the same exact problem, it froze when searching for channels.  The third computer I tried it on was my Vista laptop, same problem and Windows Media Center could not detect the tuner just like Windows 7.On all three computers I used the cleanup utility between installations to make sure I wasn't simply installing on top of itself.  The lights on the tuner were on indicating that the computer detected it (also showed up in device manager) and that it had a decent signal.  I forgot to mention that I tried using the Windows Media Center Installation file that Hauppauge provides on their website, obviously that didn't work either.As a last resort I reformatted my Windows 7 machine thinking (and hoping) that maybe something I had on there was conflicting with the tuner in some way.  I did not install a single thing before trying it on the clean install, but I had the same problem.Also, be warned that Hauppauge customer service is ridiculously horrible.  I tried contacting them before returning the tuner.  It took them 5 business days to reply to my first email and all the response said was \"Are you connecting anything between the unit and the pc (included extension usb hub etc)?\"  I responded the same day and it took another 4 business days for this response from them \"Can you give me more information on the pc you are using? Do you have another pc you can try the unit on?\"  Granted, I should have given them the specs to my computer in the first email.  But coming from a customer service/tech support background, the response time alone is terrible and the one sentence responses are mind blowing.  They should have combined those emails into the first response and gotten it to me within the 48 hr response time that I swear I saw on their website.  If I responded like that at my tech support job of 4 yrs I would've been in a lot of trouble.Needless to say, do your homework by reading both positive and negative reviews.  Also check out other sites to read their reviews.  I did and was hoping I'd be on the positive side, sadly I was not.", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome usb tuner", "Author": "A.

I wanted a product that would allow me to watch the television signal coming out of the coaxial cable coming from the wall (cable company provided).  I first tried the product with the software it came with on an older laptop (4 year old HP). The software took forever to scan the signal for channels. It eventually came back with good picture quality but some static in the audio on many channels. I tried using the fine adjustment feature that the software offers with no success. Out of curiosity I tried the hardware on my daughters newer HP laptop (just over a year old, 2 ghz, 2 gb RAM). Her laptop uses Windows Media Center which works great with the hardware. After the drivers were installed Media Center found the device, quickly found all the channels (with no audio static) and even downloaded the latest channel guide for my area. Using this product and windows media center I'm now able to watch, pause, and record live tv (similar to Tivo) as well as set up recording a show or series very easily. I would recommend this product be used with newer PC's and while the manufacturer suggests teh software provided offers the same capability as media center, I'd reccomend media center if available.

The HW seems to be OK, the issue is with the software, it freezes and crashes way too often. I think if you have a WinXP system without MCE, you don't want to consider this brand. The software is written poorly: - On Analog or Non-HD digital channel, it takes 40-50% of CPU power on my Vaio S560, 1.8Ghz Pentium M + 1.5G memory. On HD digital channel, it takes 70-80% CPU power. Switching from Analog to HD would crash the WinTV version 6, Switching from Analog to Non-HD digital then to HD is the way to workaround it, but if you kill the app when it was at HD, the app crashes every time it launches, to workaround it, you'd have to unplug the cable (so there is no signal) before launch, annoying!!

First off, the remote (if you can even call it that) did not work out of the box. It uses a watch battery and I do not have another to test with. So forget that and lets move on. The WinTV software that ships with the unit works mediocre until you try to do anything at all (like change the channel or schedule a recording)then it freezes and loses signal. That was WinTV 6. So I went to Hauppauges site and saw there is a WinTV 7 available. I tried it, and what a sorry excuse for software. I think it was written by a group of eighth graders trying a computer lab project. It froze with exception occured errors, both on an XP machine AND a Vista machine. The few times it did work, I had to watch TV in a small window. Clicking on the full screen button resulted in choppy blocky artifacts that would not play. Hauppauge has a support forum, and if you go there you will see many asking for help but the employees are not even active on it's own forum. Regular users try to help!

On Mac, Elgato's EyeTV is just the best piece of software. It just works. Install the software, pick HVR-950Q, connect your cable's coax, and scan the channels. It picks up all the Clear QAM as well as analog ATSC from your cable company.The include antenna is, indeed very cute. It picks up all those big local channels that matter (ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS that kinda thing). Using it on a laptop (in my case, MacBook Pro) is absolutely delightful. In fact, I'm getting another antenna for my desktop, so I can interchange my source between cable and off-air antenna (sometimes, off-air antenna has better quality than cable, not to mention some broadcasts that are only available off-air).On a PC, it works with Vista Media Center if you're planning to use analog cable and digital off-air antenna. Vista Media Center won't recognize the clear-QAM. If you've ever heard of TV Pack 2008 for Vista Media Center, I tried that too, but not working with HVR-950Q (not yet, hopefully, we still need proper drivers from Hauppauge). I have a HVR-1800, and it works on Vista Media Center with TV Pack perfectly, picking up all the clear QAM. So, for Vista, your option is the crappy WinTV (speaking of which, has never picked up and clear QAM channel AND show them properly on my HVR-1800), or one of those other 3rd party options (SageTV, BeyondTV and so on, but I tried both, none of which could pick any clear QAM. Not sure what the problem is, maybe just me). You might also want to check GB-PVR, an open source software. That was what I have been using for my HVR-1800 up until I installed TV Pack 2008. But then again, it's still buggy as h*ll, not as elegant as Vista Media Center, and not really consumer-friendly.Anyway, if you plan on using this on a Mac with EyeTV, it's PEERFECT.

It is far more sensitive than either the converter boxes or digital ready tvs I have used.

My desktop computer's monitor is a 2+ year old wall-mounted 19\" (16:10) Samsung 940MW with an NTSC TV tuner, speakers, and PIP built-in.  I like the monitor and its PIP function (not available in new monitors), but after the digital transition this summer its internal tuner received little.  Connecting it to a DVD recorder with an ATSC/QAM tuner fixed that, but I wanted more flexibility, DVR functionality, and the ability to move the tuner occasionally to a laptop.  The Hauppage 950Q seemed a good & relatively inexpensive solution.My Equipment . . . . Desktop = 64-bit quad 4 CPU, 4 MB RAM, 600 GB HD.  Laptop = 32-bit dual core CPU, 3 MB RAM, 160 GB HD w/15.4\" screen.  OS = Vista Home Premium.  Cable Service = Comcast.Initial Setup . . . . With a cable splitter and a longer USB extension cord, I positioned the 950Q with enough space to let the tuner's heat dissipate, so the remote could easily see it, and so it's easily removable when I want to use it with my laptop.  Drivers and WinTV7 software installed seamlessly, and the \"Digital QAM\" channel-scan took about 15 minutes.  Similar process for the laptop, but just scanned for OTA ATSC channels using the included antenna.Configuration AFTER Setup . . . . The cable scan found around 180 unencrypted channels, seven of which were HD.  Each of the HD channels also had a differently numbered separate SD channel.  Comcast's 40-some music channels were included twice.  Channel names on everything were listed as \"Unknown\".  To make this more manageable, I used WinTV7's \"Configuration\" utility to delete redundant and not-my-taste music channels, to add channel names (NBC, CBS, CNN, ESPN, etc.), and to assign simple consecutive ID numbers for logical channel ordering and for the remote (1, 2, 3, 4 . . . 85, 86, etc).  Initial set-up and scan took only an hour or so.  Configuration was much more painful - took most of a rainy Sunday afternoon/evening.Experience and Satisfaction . . . . My monitor has 1400x900 dpi resolution and uses a DVI port for computer connection.  With this, HD channels are spectacular and SD channels are good.  Channel changes take a couple of seconds (acceptable), the DVR function is nice (30 minute buffer), and the recording scheduler works well (I save recordings as .mpg files).  The 950Q's remote is a convenience, and also operates basic functions in Windows Media Center.  OTA performance on my laptop with the included antenna ranges from very good to nothing, varying with its location.  I've had no problems with WinTV7 crashing.Bottom Line . . . . I'll rate it a 5 for picture quality and features AFTER setup, and a 3 for the pain of configuration during setup.  Overall a well-satisfied 4.  I can now window and watch CNN and a football game in the background while updating spreadsheets or correspondence without the need for space-eating separate monitors. Nice.  Total cost was $80, including splitter and USB extension cord.Concerns . . . . As others have mentioned, the 950Q does get very hot when operating - a factor that gives me some worry about its longevity.  But since it comes with a 2 year manufacturer's warranty, that worry may be unfounded.  Of less importance, the remote is sometimes temperamental, and its very small size makes it easily losable.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Have Media Center (Windows), MythTV(Linux)?

About 20 - 30 % of the time the tuner reports \"loss of signal\" or \"data rate low\" or \"digital audio service (w/ sound but no picture).  When it does that it locks up the entire system.  WMC will NOT close, stops responding to all inputs, and the only way out of it is a hard reboot of the computer.When it works, with WMC, it works pretty well - good picture, synced sound, changes channels OK (but slow as hell), etc.  But that is only SOME of the time.  About one quarter of my recorded shows come out as 2 or more pieces with gaps between.  Hate that.I have tried dealing with their tech support - a challenge in and of itself.  I even sent the unit back to them for repair, etc.  I got it back, but no notice of what, if any, action they took.  Now the unit works worse than before.  Standard TV's and tuners in the same room, fed off the same cable line have no such issues.One more thing, even with the horsepower I have and 64x, running ANY other application while using the 950Q is just about a 100% guarantee of a system crash.  It's a total resource hog.  Don't plan on doing ANYTHING with your system when you are viewing OR recording TV.  Won't work.  Even an incoming email or IM will crash it.As of now I am looking to buy a different brand USB tuner.

First, the antenna worked great in my area.  I have another $100 over-the-air HD antenna, and this one pulled in the same stations, in spite of its much smaller size.  The HD over-the-air stations in my area are full 1080p, and the TV viewer displayed great quality on my HD monitor.  After trying several different scans, I found I was able to do a Clear QAM scan of my cable as well.  Pulled in a lot of channels, but mostly the same over-the-air channels plus some junk stations.  I decided to stick with the over-the-air antenna.Hauppauge wisely ships this unit with a USB extension cable.  I initially thought that they included this cable because the device is a little wider than a typical USB connector, and might impede access to other adjacent ports on the computer.  While this is true, the better reason is that a coax cable + the adapter could put some undue torque on the USB port.  I used the extender cable primarily for this reason.  Also, when I attached my cable TV coax to the device, that part of the device became very hot after a while (probably all those encrypted premium channels I don't get...LOL).  But I decided to make sure I do put papers or anything flammable around or on top of the device.  The device only gets warm with the over-the-air antenna, but this is probably a good safety practice for any active electronic device.The software is pretty easy to use.  There is a good set of help screens that are not verbose, and do a good job explaining everything.  The recorder works well.  During the scan, I got alerts for high disk activity, but not after the scan was completed.  Not a big deal.  The screen hiccups once in a while, and the manual says this is probably due to other activity in the computer.  My task manager did not show a lot going on, so I consider this to be something to watch.  Thus only 4 out of 5 stars.Be advised that the remote control (which I consider unnecessary) comes set to work with Windows Media Center, not the WinTV7 program that comes with the product.  I haven't tried to reconfigure the remote to work with WinTV7, and maybe you can't.  I also haven't tried using Windows Media Center instead of WinTV7, but I will get to that in time.

There are some strong points about the Tuner, and some cons as well:ProsI like how it has the ASTC and NTSC tuner one one input so multiple cables are not needed to get HD QAM channels and SD analogue channels.I was also very satisfied with how simply this worked with Windows 7 64-bit; I literally just plugged it in and Windows recognized it and it was working just fine.I honestly have not used the software that came with it, nor the remote control. I attempted to use the software for a TV Tuner long ago and had nothing but problems with it. Ever since then, I've just used Windows Media Center to watch TV and haven't had a single problem. The set-up was easy and the guide and 10-foot interface is very easy to use and looks great! I also had a USB IR receiver and Media Center remote that I had from a previous Tuner that I used instead of the small, cramped one that came with this.ConsThe biggest con that, to me at least, really damages the product on the whole is the lack of a hardware MPEG-2 encoder. At first I didn't think that this was going to be a problem, as my computer is fairly hardy and I thought it could handle it.Be warned, this tuner takes a long time to switch channels.Maybe it is just because I used a hardware tuner for so long that I got used to channel changing being almost instantaneous.Also, this is just a slight con that is pretty personal to me but the blue LED on the side of the tuner stays on even when the computer is not on and it is quite bright.ConclusionOn the whole, this is a nice little TV tuner that would be greatly suited for a laptop or other mobile device without a PCI or PCI-Express slot for a better tuner. It has great functions and works wonderfully with Windows 7 and Windows Media Center. The only hindrance is the card's slow tuning capability. If you are getting this card for a laptop, go ahead.

So far I have successfully recorded 3 hours of programming, and spent many more hours of frustrated attempts to get it working.I have tried it on two systems, both with Core-2 Duo hardware: one with Windows XP Media Center (SP3) and one with Windows 7.  I.e., these are reasonably modern systems, with two different supported OSes.  ATSC TV reception in my area is mediocre, but nonetheless my DTV reports a signal strength that is 90%-100%.  I also tried the 950Q on analog signals coming straight out of my DVD player, which are presumably strong.The installer is poorly programmed.  It pops up various windows on top of each other, often before I can read or click on options in the underlying window.  It was often unclear whether the installer had really finished or hanged.  I've never done so many reinstalls and reboots for anything else to get it working as I had to do for the 950Q software.The 950Q, for both ATSC and analog reception, regularly hangs during the channel scan. Even scanning for the strong signal out of the DVD player often resulted in a hang.  There appears to be no way to enter channels manually.  After many hours of trying and retrying various setups, I got lucky and a scan didn't hang.  Then it was usable for three weeks as a recorder.  Now it is back to hanging.  The hangs even stop the host machine from shutting down properly.  I have to cycle the power.Even when it was working, playback by its \"WinTV 7\" application was unreliable.  Its fast forward feature sometimes does not do anything at all, and other times hangs, or won't stop.The signal strength reporting by the device is poor - there's either a green light for excellent, a yellow light for good, or nothing at all.  A variable signal strength indicator, as on my DTV unit, would be immensely helpful.  There is no signal strength indicator during the channel scan.  You need another device (I used my DTV) to check the signal strength when doing that.Customer support by email does respond within 48 hours, but not much quicker either.

I didn't want to mail myself a TV, plus as a longtime TiVo user I don't think I know how to watch a TV show when it's actually scheduled.  Since I was bringing a laptop I figured this would be the perfect combination of TV tuner and DVR yet take up little space.Before I left I hooked up the antenna and found I was able to received HD channels right off the air.  So far so good, though it wasn't a very useful discovery to me personally since we already get HD through our FiOS connection.In the far far away land to which I was sent, one of the first things I did was hook up the cable and fire up the software.  In just a couple of minutes the software had identified the dozen or so channels available to me and I was ready to go.The hardware piece is small - just slightly larger than a USB drive.  The included USB extension cable is about 18 inches long and is a nice convenience - with it you don't have the coaxial cable pulling directly on your USB port.The included software, while usable, is not too friendly.  It's straightforward to use but requires a lot of clicking around to set up the channels and programs to record.  The software's only redeeming feature is it records shows as MPEG files (extension mpg), so they can be played back with any software, or even edited using a movie editor.I prefer to use Windows Media Center, which plays nicely with this unit.  It's easy to use with a friendly user interface.  The recordings are in a proprietary format, however.  This doesn't matter to me since I just watch the shows and delete them.Others have complained about CPU usage, speed of channel changing, and the heat the unit puts out.I haven't experienced any issues with recording or playback, but my laptop is new and has a dual core processor.  CPU usage runs between 25-40%.  Channel changing is slower than my TiVo, but not greatly so.  When I'm watching live TV or recording a show the unit does get warm but that's not unexpected considering the amount of circuitry packed into this little device.

Now, on to the product.The antenna is *rubbish*.  This is fine.  The box was a bit ambiguous as to if one was even included, and the instruction manual itself calls the antenna virtually worthless.  Buy a cheap powered antenna and get over your disappointment.The little cable for connecting RCA jacks would be handy if there were any software for Linux that could access it.  Sadly this appears to not be the case, and short of configuring WINE, this makes it binnable by the vast majority of you.  I strongly urge you avoid WINE, but hey, it's your computer.  I've put it in the spare parts bin until I find a way to use it.The little extender cable for the USB is handy if you need a little extra length to position your antenna, or, more likely, to get the cable from your box to reach.The remote biscuit \u00abit isn't worthy of the name control\u00bb is a nuisance device solely there so you won't whine at the device being $10 too expensive.  I recommend you ship it back to them covered in wet rubber cement.Use the included disc battery to power your travel clock.Obviously, as I don't use Windows, I've binned the CD.The device itself, provided you've followed my suggestion about the antenna or attached it to a cable box, does as advertised.  It's a tuner, both analogue and digital.  That's all.Now, here's what you need:  Kaffeine.  It's in your repository.  It's free.  It works.  You don't even have to restart.That's all.  No special software, no faffing about with .conf files.  Just install it and start it.  You can follow the self-evident procedure from there.  Just remember it's double-click to change channels.  Somehow they never think that might be needed information.Now off you go!  Revel in the fact that Linux is superior in every way.

Using with Media Player there is an even greater delay, and sometimes the audio becomes out of sync. Restarting the PC usually fixes this.

Brown", "ReviewID": "R1MWN0HA7WE558", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the most recent revision of the 950Q, purchased in January of 2012.  It's worth pointing out that this is a different package than that sold previously, with the same model number.  The back of my stick reads as follows:NTSC/ATSC/QAM HD TV receiver72001 LF Rev B4F0  4311.(It also lists a unique MAC address, which you may need if dealing with your local cable company)The box this shipped in is a smaller box than shown in the images, above, and instead of the white styrofoam insert, there's a brown corrugated cardboard insert.The stick is present, as is the little AV patch cable, and the antenna, as well as a remote.  I say \"A remote\" because the remote provided is NOT the remote shown in the images above.  My remote is not the type with a membrane switch face, and would not slip into the card slot of a laptop (and since those slots are not even included anymore, that makes sense).  The new remote has the same raised rubber buttons most remotes have, albeit in a small and portable form factor.  It seems as though there are a couple of buttons on the other remote which aren't present on this one, but since I can't see a close-up of the other remote, I can't be certain.The remote I was provided with seems to work fine, but there's a significant \"lag\" between using it and having the WinTV 7 software respond.  (By the way, this package came with the latest version of WinTV7, v2.4d, on CD, which leads me to conclude that this is a newer release, not an older one, though there's no way to be certain).The antenna seems to work better than I'd have expected, and should be more than servicable for my \"travel use\" needs.  I need to get a slim coax cable to travel with to patch into cable TV as well, and that's not provided here... only the antenna is provided.  But the antenna works nicely... I was able to get 16 channels here in Austin, TX, while the FCC's site suggested I could only expect to receive about ten.It's worth noting that I get more channels using the provided WinTV  application than I do when using Windows Media Center.  I fail to see why the provided application would receive more, but it does.  I get about ten channels using WMC, with the rest being \"below threshold.\"The antenna provided is acceptable, but a better antenna will undoubtedly improve overall reception.  I plan to obtain a \"leaf plus\" antenna (which should be easy to carry when traveling) which will, if reports hold true, double the number of receivable stations for me.  We'll see.  Of course, a real, outdoors directional antenna would be a huge benefit, but that's impractical for a device whose main reason for existence is to be PORTABLE, after all.As several others have mentioned, the device becomes warm.  Not \"HOT\" (ie, you can still touch it) but it clearly draws a lot of power.  Your best bet, long-term, is to use it with an external, powered USB hub.  However, it works just fine off my little netbook's internal power.  The install guide recommends not using it with a hub, but that seems clearly to be more about power than about \"lag,\" and going through an externally-powered hub should cause no problems.  (I plan to obtain a new 8-port powered hub later tonight, and I'll revise this review if this changes.)The remote isn't \"ideal\" but is acceptable.  However, I strongly recommend trying a little device made by a Chinese company called \"Riitek.\"  You'll find several variations of that being sold on Amazon right now, and often using different names (usually the exporter selling it into the USA, not the original manufacturer, though).I have this little device in both BT and 2.4Ghz radio versions.  Unless you find the idea of using a \"dongle\" undesirable, I actually prefer the 2.4Ghz version overall, though they're effectively identical in most ways.  Here's the one I bought... though the name it's listed under on Amazon has changed since I bought it.http://www.amazon.com/FAVI-Entertainment-Wireless-Keyboard-TouchPad/dp/B003UE52ME/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_tAnd here's the Blutooth version...  which is nicer, overall, but nearly identical... and which has the minor drawback of occasionally dropping connection in \"blutooth-heavy\" environments (like, say, airports).http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Bluetooth-Keyboard-Cellphones-touchpad/dp/B0042VF30U/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1326141350&sr;=1-3You'll find these sold by a number of folks on Amazon.  ALL are made by Riitek.  They're GREAT devices, frankly, and are of high-quality (unlike so many Chinese-made-and-designed objects I've dealt with over the years).

What a bummer to take such a step backwards.October 2012 update (changed from 2 to 4 stars) - I just stumbled across this review and realized that in this moment, I'm actually watching TV on my other Windows 7 laptop with this device and have been doing so for a few years now.  I've had to reinstall the operating system (long boring story) on both laptops several times and have configured this device on each machine several times.  Each time, I have to hunt down the install disk (DONT'T LOSE THIS!) AND download certain drivers and things and eventually it functions properly.  Once you finally get it configured, it works quite well.  I've been using it almost daily for about 4 years (with cable and with a digital antenna).  So, I apologize to those I may have put off with my previous review, but I really was struggling with it, until they finally came out with some Windows 7 fixes.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Works on both my Mac and Win 7", "Author": "happyguy", "ReviewID": "R1FJZK4FDLUKQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The unit that shipped with EyeTv from Elgato died at home, I found that this is the exact same unit for $30 less.

The setup is very easy and you couldn't make it wrong.At the beginning I was using the small antenna came with the tuner indoor, and WMC didn't detect any channel. To make sure everything is set properly, I went out with both the small antenna and my newly purchased antenna direct DB2 to the parking lot and with both it detected about 20 channels. You wouldn't believe the signal unless you see it, amazing :), crystal clear. Considering that I am around 28 miles from NYC the reception is great. After making sure everything was set up fine, I brough the antennas into the house and tried to find different positions to get better signal. I live in the first floor of a two-story apartment, and there are a lot of trees around it. But finally I did manage to get a few channels inside the room. NBC, Fox, CBS and PBS (which are UHF channels) and a few other local channels are great. I cannot get ABC since it's using VHF. The DB2 is better than the antenna came with the tuner.As others mentioned, I am afraid the tuner becomes hot too soon. You may need to take a rest after a while, or try other method to cool it down. After watching 1-hour TV, it's becoming very hot. Not sure if you can continue to use it for a long time without problems.

After having my local cable company's channels downloaded in the program/computer, it ran fine right after that. It has its own viewer program, but I prefer using Windows Media Center and the Live TV function. With Media Center, you get to see channel, program name, brief summary of program, and program running time.My only problem was that it didn't download/recognize about 4-5 channelsthat I used to have with my old ATI TV Wonder tuner. Neither of these missing channels show up on the integrated viewer provided, or on Media Center. The only really notable one being TLC (The Learning Channel),which for some reason doesn't show up on its normal channel (28 in my area). It shows the other normal expected channels in my area (from 2-73), since the ones higher up require a digital cable box (which I have for the 3 TVs in my home), and wasn't expecting to get them anyway, since I alreadt knew from my last ATI TV Wonder Tuner, that these encrypted channels don't show up.

I have tried both with XP, XP Professional, Vista and Windows 7. I currently have the 2250 installed in my Windows 7 computer. Yesterday it was working fairly well and found over a dozen channels but today it has only found 10 channels, some of which are not working very well, The 950Q is currently connected to a Vista computer and has found 17 channels, all of which are working well. The next time I try to use either tuner; they may show as no tuner available as that happens frequently. I have reloaded and or scanned for channels numerous times, using both tuners. When I turn them on, they frequently indicate there is no tuner available. When they are working, I never know when they will just stop working.I do not have either tuner connected to my OTA Antenna, but have them connected to my Internet Cable, yes, I said Internet Cable. I don't know why but I am getting channels which I did not get with my regular cable. Some of them were only available in the next higher group, meaning some are movie channels. I don't know if this is typical or not, but as long as I am receiving them on my Internet Cable, I will continue to watch or record them when something is on which I want to see.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perpetually fickle product", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R2AQBKW9JMUONZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This product has generally worked for us for the past 3 years or so, but it is very fickle.

Since it had an HDMI connector I've begun using it to stream Netflix and thought I'd put the near-empty harddrive to use as a DVR for over-the-air broadcasts. Since Vista Business lacks Media Center and many other media playthings I (and the store clerk) had some doubts about whether this thing would work but I was glad to see it functions as advertised - that is, as advertised both by Hauppauge AND the many Amazon users who report bugs in the WinTV 7 software. After a few hours I've learned how to dodge some problems by avoiding certain key sequences or by not going too fast, particularly when changing channels using the up-down buttons. I haven't tried the supplied remote yet; I do everything onscreen using a wireless mini-keyboard with media keys. My amplified outside antenna comes down into a splitter with one output going to the TV's antenna in, the other output goes to the tuner stick so I can record independently of what I'm watching. No problems with signal loss but I do notice the HDMI picture from the computer is often (not always) inferior to the direct antenna feed by being a tad washed-out or grainy. This I compensated for by making and saving a suitable video preset on the TV (I have no such issue with Netflix or other streaming HD) There's also a very noticeable volume drop. On the other hand this USB stick is a heck of a lot cheaper than a Tivo or obsolete DVR for just recording a few (usually old) shows a week.As a side note I tried downloading and installing NextPVR as an alternative recording program - got many error messages during the install and while I was eventually able to get a picture and a mostly-blank guide, overall it was a far worse program than WinTV7 feature-wise.UPDATE Dec. 2012: After using this for awhile w/ Vista Business it's been an extremely frustrating experience. For one thing I found if I used the video input dongle for composite or S-video recording I had a devil of a time getting it to record TV channels again. The Scheduler is extremely touchy, will stop working for no reason and it seems once it is working, any disturbance to the computer or Scheduler will kill it. The only fix is to reboot the computer each time. I'm going to install Windows 7 on all my machines, we'll see.

My other tuner is a PCI Pinnacle PCTV HD 800i.  When it's recording HD, my server consumes about 5% CPU usage.  When the Hauppauge HVR-950Q is recording HD, my server averages 30-40% CPU.For me, it's not that big of a deal since my video card supports complete MPEG2 off-loading(acceleration), meaning that when I'm watching an HD show, it uses less than 5% CPU. But this is a buyer-beware that if you don't have an MPEG2 accelerated video card, you may not be able to record a show while watching a previously recorded show at the same time (or the playback may be a little choppy).  If you have an old'ish PC for your Media Center, I'd recommend 2x PCI tuner cards, or a 1x PCI-e dual-tuner (one card with 2x built-in tuners).If you just recording single shows, or watching live HD on a laptop, you'll be happy with this product.- Jeff", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hauppauge HVR-950Q TV Tuner", "Author": "Mikey", "ReviewID": "R39YEVK3DOWAXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty easy to install.

Wagner", "ReviewID": "R3OOQSBUOG2O96", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "950Q is a solid tv tuner and recording device. I use it for broadcast tv and the included mini antenna picked up almost all the channels that my larger antenna did. The device allows you to plug in any antenna or cable TV source. HD quality on the computer is great. Compared to PCI devices, this USB one obviously can be switched between computers or used with a laptop at home or on the go. 950Q does not have hardware MPEG2 encoding like others (most PCI and HDPVR) though, which means recording action sports in HD, for example, may suffer. I bought this mainly to time-shift NFL games, and the record quality is a little disappointing (quick camera pans on a pass play are mostly lost to blur and slow encoding). Watching live football does not produce the same problems, ie. blur, dropped frames. And no other shows I've seen so far do it either.950Q does all software encoding. So the speed of your computer may determine your ability to record and watch shows happily. The new Wintv 7 works well on XP. But, when watching recorded shows, it is a resource hog compared to VLC player for example. Despite its flaws (occasional crashes, cpu usage) Wintv works well to schedule recordings and record in the background. The Wintv scheduler works great with [...] program guide. Go on the website, click on your show, click 'record' and it downloads a tvpi file which is automatically recognized by Wintv and the record schedule is set. Call it two-click recording. Or go into Wintv and schedule the old-fashioned way: channel, time, date. Also set it up to record every day/week.950Q also works through Windows Media Center, without the Wintv program. I would like to try that, but have not yet. Media Center offers some added features, such as options to control the file size/quality of recordings. Wintv doesn't do that. Wintv also doesn't have a video library to organize video files, which Media Center does, I believe.Bottom line: if you want to watch TV on the computer, this thing works great. If you're serious about recording HD shows, you may consider the built-in PCI devices or the HD-PVR, which have dedicated encoding chips to get the best resolution. Also Hauppauge makes PCI devices that allow you to record two channels at once, (or watch one, record another) if you are really serious and have no tv.(Computer disclaimer: the video problems I encountered were on a newer AMD X2 chip, 2GB ram, integrated video chip.

You need the Tivo Desktop Plus software version 2.6.2 for this to work. I also used a \"rabbit ear\" antenna instead of the one that came with the tuner, that may have helped.All in all, I like this tuner. BTW, my Series 3 Tivo can record 2 Hi-def programs at the same time. The reason I was looking for this solution is that my local cable company, Suddenlink, does not carry the CW network in Hi-def.

The main reason I wanted live TV on my computer is so I could watch the news in the morning while I surfed the web. Installation literally couldn't be easier. You simply plug in the device to an available USB port and then attach either the included antenna or a cable connection. Windows 7 instantly recognized the device and it took less than a minute to download and install the drivers.That's not to say I didn't run in to a few problems during the setup process, however any issues were on my end and not any fault of the product. A few notes that might help potential buyers:-I briefly tried the tuner with the included antenna, but couldn't really pick up any of the channels. Even if I could have, it only would have been local over-the-air broadcast networks (NBC, ABC, FOX, etc.).-My computer desk is located on the same wall as my internet/cable jack, so I simply had to use a 3-way splitter: one cable to my modem and one cable to the tuner device. I haven't noticed any degradation in my internet speed.-I have not installed the included WinTV software. From what I've read, it tends to be buggy. Instead, I am using Windows Media Center, which was included on my PC when I purchased it. After plugging in the tuner, I simply ran the set-up wizard in Windows Media Center and before long I was watching live TV.  Media Center also has a rewind/pause feature and lets you record live TV, just like the included software. Why not use something that's already installed and integrated with your machine?-At first, the signal had quite a bit of interference. This was fixed by swapping out one of the cables for another one. I don't know anything about different types of coax cables, but switching at least one of them seemed to fix the problem.-Because I'm already a cable subscriber, the jacks in my house were all activated with basic cable. This means that in addition to all the local networks (some of which are in HD and look fantastic), I get about 50 or so basic cable channels. None of the cable channels are in HD, so they aren't widescreen or crystal clear, but they still look great and are watchable. You can attach a regular TV to the jack that the tuner will use to see what channels you are supposed to be getting.Finally, I'll add that I'm using the tuner with a pretty fast machine with plenty of juice: Windows 7 64-bit with an Intel i7 processor and 8GB of RAM, and an ATI Radeon HD 5670 graphics card. I get the sense that less powerful machines would be able to handle this tuner just fine, but you still probably need a decent processor to handle the extra load.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good product - would be better with some software improvements", "Author": "Robert N.

It conveniently and reliably allows one to record TV programs to the hard drive of one's computer.  However, most folks like to watch TV on their regular TV screen.  Thus, one needs to be able to get the recorded file to one's regular TV.  One way to do this is to burn a DVD and use a DVD player to watch the program.  However, the software provided with the Hauppauge uses a dot ts format.  Thus, one must first convert the dot ts file to a format (i.e., dot mpg) that can be used to burn a DVD.  I was unable to locate a suitable program to do this conversion and Hauppauge was not able to suggest one.  Note:  the Hauppauge software also allows one to record using a dot mpg format - but this recording method is not reliable.

WinTV-HVR 950Q HYBRID TV STICKThis review is based on my use of the TV adapter on two computers and the supplied antenna and a cable connection on two computers.An old Dell Latitude D running Windows XP and an ASUS Viveotab Smart running Windows 8 (no CD/DVD drive)I am not a computer expert, but I do know my way around them.LOADING THE SOFTWAREI loaded the CD into the Del and followed the directions. The software loaded as expected. I then did the channel scan. The first time the system did not find any signals. I moved the antenna to a better location and I was able to re-scan and find 15 channels.I downloaded the full software package from the Hauppauge web site to the Asus. I then tried to follow the directions on the support site. After two (2) days of trying I finally copied the supplied CD to a thumb drive, then copied that file to the ASUS and was able to load that software. Then I applied the downloaded software. It took three (3) days of frustrating effort to make it work on the ASUS.OPERATING THE DEVICEWhen I started to use the device on the Dell, I was happy with the picture. It looked very good. When I tried to watch the different channels I was dissapointed that many of them would break up very often and were not watchable at all.  I do understand that this may be due to poor reception of the antenna. Once I found the channel I did want to watch and I was getting a good receipiton, I was not getting ANY sound. I called the support phone and got excellent service! The problem was a simple fix of selecting the \u201cEnglish\u201d audio stream.For the first half hour or so of watching, the system seemed fine. After that, the picture started to degrade. It began to have part of the screen go black and/or freeze. The longer I watched, the worse the problem became. It was VERY frustrating trying to watch an hour show. If I shut down the program, wait a min & then restart it, I was good for another time period. At some point, the picture would freeze. Also, if I watch full screen, the freeze takes place in less time.Once I had the software loaded on the ASUS, I did a channel scan and on the first try got nothing. So, in an attempt to compare the two systems I set up the Dell and did a scan. The Dell found 15. I then shut down the Dell without moving it AT ALL! I started the ASUS and set it on the keyboard of the Del, unplugged the USB from the Dell and plugged it into the ASUS with NO movement of the antenna at all. The ASUS found three (3) stations!When watching TV with the system, I have the same problem on the ASUS as I did on the Dell. After a time, the picture starts to break up and it will eventually freeze. If I watch full screen, it happens faster.I then used a free computer cleaning program (like CCleaner). One that has run, the system did seem to last a bit longer without freezing up. I have also noticed that if I shut down the program and NOT the computer, then bring the TV program back up it tends to stay stable for a longer time than the first time.Also note, during all of the testing above, when the computer and unit was on, the connection to computer LED was on and green. And, the signal strength LED was green with a few flashes of yellow every so often. All of the testing was with the best station I was receiving.As the old Dell has XP on it that is no longer supported, I removed most programs from it and did the testing one more time. It did work a bit better. Connected to the cable, I DID see all of the channels, but still had the freezing problem. IF I use the cleaner program often, it works better.Another note, as the directions state, you MUST BE CLOSE to the TV transmitter or you get NOTHING!I would say that this device is good for temp use, but NOT, as a TV replacement.Greg", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Couldn't get supplied software to run", "Author": "W.

A few notes:1. Although many Windows computers will automatically download the drivers for this tuner, those drivers will often be out of date. Be sure to download the latest drivers from the Hauppauge website. (If you're using Windows Media Center, it'll hang while trying to find signals if you're using an outdated driver.)2. If you have a computer with Windows Media Center, you won't need the software that comes with this tuner; Windows Media Center automatically detected the card and TV signals (after I updated the drivers), and it's an intuitive, robust program that works like a charm.3. The antenna that comes with this tuner will only suffice if you live in a metropolitan area where all of the broadcast signals generate within a 10-mile radius; the rest of us will need a heftier antenna. The Mohu Leaf is a good option, although I use the ChannelMaster DB8 since many of our local broadcasts generate from 30+ miles away.4. I don't know if the included remote will work with Windows Media Center, but I use the Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad.

It's my first experience with a PC tuner, and first experience with Windows Media Center, as well. I was driven to a tuner by my desire for a new big screen TV. For years, I have used a Vizio HDTV for my computer monitor. That TV had a picture-in-picture feature that allowed me to watch TV while doing other computing. None of the current HDTVs offer PIP. This device gives me the functionality I need.I was concerned that the tuner would not be as sensitive as the tuners in my HDTV's, and would not be able to pick up as many channels, via the antenna in my attic. Wrong! It picked up all of my regular channels, as well as a few more. (Only 1 of the extra channels was really watchable; signal on the others was marginal, which may explain why the HDTVs had not registered them.)The installation with Windows 7 Home Premium was simple. Drivers were downloaded and installed automagically, by Windows. I didn't need ANY of the software on the provided disc. The hardest part of the install was finding the invisible menu in Windows Media Center. I had hooked up the tuner, but, because I could not find the menu, I de-installed WMC, rebooted, then reinstalled WMC. That was probably not necessary, but, at least I stumbled into the menu, on the later attempt. The menu walked me nicely through channel registration.There are two things in the packaged install provided on the disc that I wanted in my setup: the signal strength meter, and the software to allow use of the remote control. Although there are no menu items on the install disc to get these individual components, it may be possible to get them installed via disc navigation with Windows file manager. But, I had already seen the two items as available in the support area of Hauppauge's web site, so, I downloaded and installed them.Windows users that do not have WMC will want to install from the disc, to get the WinTV application, which I did not try.Windows Media Center works great. And, it works great with the Hauppauge remote... kinda-sorta. The signal from the remote is very weak, the small gummy buttons (the current remote does not match the product photo on Amazon) are hard to use accurately, and the buttons repeat after a not-very-long press, so, it's easy to  accidentally toggle the mute button on-off-on-off, for example. Another problem with the remote is that there's no dot or dash to use during direct input of over-the-air channels. You can not enter 3.2, so, you can not do direct entry of any OTA channels; you have to use channel up/down, or select from the WMC guide. Also, the Prev Channel button does not work as expected in WMC: it toggles between full screen and window, which is nice to have.So, I set about teaching the tuner's remote functions to my universal remote. Now, I have a sweet, sweet setup. There's one other minor niggle about the remote's functions with WMC. I'm not sure whether Hauppauge or Microsoft is more to blame, and whether there might be a workaround: When WMC is not the active window, it cannot receive channel change or menu functions, while volume controls do continue to work. Since I'm normally working on other applications, the WMC window is usually not the active window. Oh, I JUST found a partial workaround while checking details for this review: the WMC On/Off button on the remote also functions to make WMC the active window. So, if I had been using another program, then set the keyboard/mouse aside, then later want to change channels with the remote, I can hit the power button, then the channel button.The tuner unit is warm, but, not hot. You do have to position the unit with extension cable thoughtfully to receive remote functions, and this makes it a challenge not to have unsightly cables laying all around.I love this tuner, but, will take off one star for the minor annoyances.---2 months later: Well, the remote functions were nice, but, they died. No, there's nothing wrong with my universal remote, nor the one that came with the tuner. But, the IR receiver in the tuner seems to have gradually died. In the beginning, a few functions stopped working, or became inconsistent. Reboot, or stop and restart of the IR software sometimes fixed it. Now, all remote functions are gone. I have new appreciation for keyboards with media buttons. Also, I have become aware of keyboard shortcuts for Windows Media Center; all functions you would control with a remote can be controlled by a standard keyboard. For the remote problem, I'd have to downgrade the tuner by half a star.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Quality", "Author": "tawin", "ReviewID": "R2DR39E7S4ZEFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is easy to use.The quality of file which is recorded from TV is good.ATSC and NTSC are both worked.Can be used in Ubuntu 12.04", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best tuner", "Author": "G.

Also supplied is a trail version of a streaming TV program; \"filmontv\" that works on Mac or Windows. Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows Vista are supported by this device. Did not test it on Mac, my installation is Windows 7 64bit.Installation: Very straightforward with this device; follow the instructions supplied; however, before using for the first time I recommend you do a restart on your computer. Install the WinTV-HVR-950Q first, then load the supplied software second, and then do a computer restart before using.Ease of tuning: Great; it has a supplied remote control, and you can pre-load channels to have the ones you watch most often readily available. I don't bother using the remote; once your local channels are scanned, click on them onscreen to bring them up.Picture quality: Depends on local channels signal strength; but outstanding on strong ones.Antenna note: None of the small antennas supplied with these TV Tuners are really good, unless you are close to the local stations; it is an antenna size thing; larger size equals better signal capture area.

I purchased this yesterday at Best Buy (I should've checked the price of Amazon first because I paid $20 more at Best Buy), but I was already enjoying all the channels that this thing picked up.  I initially used the Windows Media Center that came with my old Windows 7 PC, but WMC only picked up the analog channels.  When I used the WinTV software that came with the product, however, all digital and analog channels were picked up, including some local HD channels (ABC, Fox, CBS, etc...).  The only drawback is that it doesn't have a program guide like WMC and I have to rename every single channel.  When I schedule a recording, I have to look up the shows on my favorite channels and manually put in the time and duration of the recording.  Other than that, I was surprised at how many channels this little thing picked up.  I'm very happy with it, so far and all I need to do now is purchase a 2TB external hard drive that I'll connect to the computer PC since my old PC only has 350 GB of hard drive (well, less than that, of course because of all the other programs I have in it).  It wasn't hard to install at all.  The channel scanning does take a while to finish, but it's worth the wait.

I had an external dual tuner earlier, but it required a couple of extra wires which i didn't like. The usb sticks work great (though i had to use the usb extender cable as they are too big to occupy adjacent usb slots)Installation: Didn't do anything. Windows identified the tuners and did whatever was needed. I am using the media center with basic cable, and it scanned for all the available channels without much input from me. It has been more than 2 weeks now and the system has been working great mostly. There is an occasional stuttering in video but I suspect it's because of the CPU/graphics limitation and not because of the tuner.Accessories: They provide a lot of accessories which I wish weren't there. Among them, an antenna and a pretty inconvenient remote. I hope they come up with a package which doesn't include this and we can help reduce some waste (and that's the reason I am taking off one star). The remote didn't work but I suspect I have to install the WinTV software for that. I wasn't going to use WinTV or the remote anyway, so gave up on the remote after few seconds.I also purchased a windows MC remote from amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Control-Infrared-Receiver-Ultimate/dp/B00224ZDFY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1293048243&sr;=8-1) and it works great with rest of the system.EDITED in DEC, 2011:After having used this tuner for a long time, there are a couple of significant changes in my opinion. First, the default Windows 7 driver started causing problems only after a few days but it was all ok once I installed the driver that came with the tuner (nothing wrong with that)Secondly, for past few months, the tuner(s) has(have) been acting up.

The unit configured perfectly and easily and I received prompt assistance from a Hauppauge representative for the one question that I had.  A short USB extension cable is provided which protects your laptop from the heat generated by almost any TV tuner and I strongly recommend its use.Ultimately, the tuner turned out not to be as useful for the laptop as anticipated because of a lack of OTA channels in our area and the fact that if I am near a cable coaxial connection, I have no need to watch TV on a laptop.Determined to get my money's worth from my investment, I connected the USB Hauppauge to a desktop computer that was in a room with a cable connection and signed up for a free account at Orb.com.  That was a good move.  Now I have access to a TV anyplace where there is a computer with online access (providing, of course, that my home computer is on and connected to the internet) and the video and audio quality is excellent.Because of the USB connection, this type of unit offers tremendous portability advantages over integrated TV tuners.  You can always remove it from a desktop and pack it in your laptop case if you are likely to be in an area where there are OTA channels.  If you buy a new computer, you need not buy another TV tuner as long as this works.

It requires a very strong antenna (stronger than the one that ships with it for sure), or cable (with QAM).

You read right.  Even when you DOWNLOAD the software, you still need the original CD-ROM.I had to do a reinstall of my OS and tried to install this and discovered my CD was cracked and pretty much every other piece of hardware I own usually has updated versions of the software online anyway so this was no big deal I thought and downloaded the latest version of this online.  Then in the middle of the installation, the program asks to insert the original CD.I talked with tech support and they told me point blank to pay up or they won't give me replacement software.  There is absolutely no technical reason for this other than greed.  I have a 10 year old laser printer and can still download the software for it online.  My backup external drive has it online, my 8 year old router still has software online, and I could go on and on so I really don't understand how they expect people to keep every original CD for hardware.On another note, what about Netbook users?  how would they install the software for this?

I would prefer to put it toward a Kindle Fire HD as I has spoken to whoever that is, and I wanted to wait.Things kept going wrong and worse with the girl I just had on the phone & after 45 minutes, I could not hold the phone any longer as I am disabled and told her that.She still wanted me to hold on and placed me on hold.After 5 more minutes I hung up and still have no idea what is going to happen to the $68.99 I have already paid & my credit card is NOT where I wish the credit to go.I could not even get it across to her that there were three of these units and this one had been opened before I got it.There is something in the box rattling around that your company should exercise caution when you open it as it weighs 1 pound more than the two previous ones I received.I am extremely upset.To add to that, when I asked her to call me back after she found out the answer to my problem, she put me on hold again.I am just about through with Amazon.The size & scope of your company is getting out of control.I am constantly getting emails.Then when I tried to find the RMA for the third & FINAL product I purchased, (how fast can you look through 500Gigs of storage to find it) she kept on with the need to tell me something or talk to something or someone else.Right now I am so upset I would rather go to Walmart and pay the difference then to deal with this hassle anymore.All I wanted to do was get the unit returned for one of s I could afford.Not only did I have this hassle but the reason for calling in the first place was UPS messed up before as they did today, the original reason I tried to call in the first place.I had to chase after the UPS driver that did not pick up the last package and left the new replacement unit on the front porch in the open & basically on the street in a new Amazon box that was not opened; however, he opened the door (which it fit behind where I had the second one placed for pickup) to put a sticker on the door that he was here and did not pick up the box at his feet & that it was a first attempt to pick up the defective unit.With that in mind when I saw him leaving the community I live in this morning, I asked him if he picked it up today & he did not have a notion of what I was talking about.He waited while I came home got the package and went back where I found him (he did not come to my house I had to chase him down) handed it to the driver.He took it and gave me NOTHING in exchange; no package receipt, no label stub, nothing.After that, I call Amazon thinking I would get some help and what I got was a very long hassle from a person I could not understand and asked for a supervisor that I did not get a chance to talk to.What is going on?I had good intent to give all my business to your company but now am gun shy of it.I guess I am just out the monies and the Kindle Fire, well, if this is the support you get with electronics less than $100 you can forget it.I can't even talk to anyone about the trouble.I will just purchase an Apple or something or one someplace else.their nasty gram is:If you're due a refund you'll receive another e-mail confirmation shortly.See our return policy for our returns timeline at www.amazon.com/help/returnsWe look forward to seeing you again soon.Note: YOU CANNOT SEND e-mails TO THEM BECAUSE THEY USE -->  ... sent from a notification-only e-mail address that cannot accept incoming e-mail.
