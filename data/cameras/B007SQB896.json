{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Interesting", "Author": "Donteatyellowsnow \"The Hammer\"", "ReviewID": "RLGUP0ANV1N1A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "1) Order extra batteries, you will need them if shooting for more than a couple of hours.2) Despite the small sensor, IQ is surprisingly good at the lower ISOs.  The basic zoom lens is very sharp, even wide open.  The photozone.com review is worth reading.3) Depth of field could be an issue since the small sensor and lens combinations make a lot of the image sharp.4) There is a benefit to the small camera: It doesn't get in the way.  The IQ won't be as good as a DSLR, but it your goal is screen or 8' x 10\"s, then this is just fine.5) An interesting benefit to this camera is with telephoto photography (e.g., birding).  The crop factor is 5.5, meaning you can stick a 300mm lens on it (with an adaptor) and get a 1650mm 35mm equivalent, or the sharp 50mm 1.7 Pentax M that everyone buys for $45 on ebay and get a 275mm 35mm equivalent! If you need quality images from a super telephoto, but don't have quality lenses with the 400mm+ reach, the Pentax Q offers a cheap and easy way to do this (provided you don't mind using cheaper older lenses that are manual).  As most people know, you can get better image quality using a great 200mm lens (and blowing up the image) rather than using an average 400mm lens.  Well, now you can use that super-sharp 100mm portrait lens gathering dust in the closet and get great images using it as a 550mm equivalent on the Pentax Q. This is an interesting benefit to the camera.6) Shooting RAW is no problem on those HDR shots (assuming you do not want to use the in-camera HDR mode) by making a selection after the shot.  I wish I could just set the camera to capture all shots in RAW automatically in certain situations.7) Definately upgrade to the new firmware as soon as you get the camera. It will help with focusing and with other issues.8) I am disappointed in the fish-eye, since it is more of a \"toy\" lens than a super sharp one.  It is just fine when shoot something close to you, but the \"distance\" shots (like the inside of that romantic Irish Pub you crawled into) are just average.9) The main knock on the camera was never the IQ, which is good emough. The issue was what you are getting for $800. Well, now the price is below $250 with the 02 basic zoom lens.  I can easily justify the cost because: 1) It is so small I can always have a camera with me (like when skiing), 2) I now have an inexpensive way to shoot long distance shots with very good to excellent IQ; and 3) It is simply fun to use.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "For Pentax K Mount owners - Just incredibleI!!!", "Author": "shutterbug \"shutterbug2\"", "ReviewID": "R3IBL6PUY1T8HN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was debating to purchase a Pentax K01 which unfortunately has been discontinued. Glad that I instead bought the Pentax Q. Words alone cannot describe the incredible feeling you get once you pick up this tiny engineering marvel. Small as a digital compact but almost as mighty as a DSLR.The standard zoom lens alone is an incredible piece of hardware and functionality. It takes beautiful and vivid images that are even more gorgeous when you look at them on you computer screen. This zoom lens is a lot smaller than the ones you see on the Sony NEX and Nikon of Samsung mirrorless cameras.I also ordered a Fotodiox Pentax K adapter which allowed me to use my old 120mm Tamron prime lens as well as my standard 35mm, 50mm, 70-150mm and 80-200mm just like I did in the old days when I was using film. Mind you, the only drawback is that you can only use these lenses in manual mode and only with a tripod since there is a 5.5X multiplier effect.  This means that you 35mm becomes a 175mm lens and etc. which do need a monopod or tripod to keep it steady.Also if you are ordering the Fotodix adapter be aware that a tripod mount is already built in the adapter and no additional tripod collar is needed to mount the older and longer zoom lenses. Otherwise still great pictures even when using it handheld.For my purposes, I am using an old pistol grip from my old 8mm movie camera which allows you to hold in one hand and adjust the zoom with the other. A flash bracket works equally as well.I just had the camera for several days and already I am impressed with the number of features and special effects that it capable of.In closing, the price I paid for the Q is is more than bargain considering that you had an excellent zoom lens as well the ability to use your older lenses which have definitely better optics than some of the point and shoot cameras that are on the market. It is a definite advantage when you are seeing through a pure optical verses a digital zoom. I also began using my old Vivitar 2700 which has a guide number of 80 with incredible success. Talk about having enormous flash power to spare.  It just doesn't get any better.With the adapter it does feel rather small since most older Pentax K lenses were rather large and longer and fatter than the Q. This disadvantage is easily overlooked once you see the incredible images that you can produce once again this time in a digital format.Highly recommended by a veteran Pentax owner.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "My second Q, first with the 02 lens", "Author": "Perry Carmichael \"pc\"", "ReviewID": "R27N1L7UN8C6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Q is just a great camera. Very adaptable system: I have SLR lens adapters, movie camera lens adapters, scope sight kit, a real pleasure to use the Q. It has great image quality. Focus peeking is awesome if you any manual lens, very easy to gain crisp focus. easy to set up custom settings on the front dial. Just a great camera. The 02 lens is pretty good too. It is a bit big, making the camera no longer shirt-pocketable. I don't really care about the long end of the zoom, as there is not much reach. I do love the wide end. That said, the fisheye is an awesome wide angle lens and you can remove distortion in photoshop. The 01 lens is still my favorite because it is small, fast and sharp.

My first dslr was a Nikon D40, my final is a Pentax K5.  Here are a few of the things I love about the Q.  The size:  I have large hands and it's still easy to operate the controls and buttons and it feels good to hold.  The small size makes it easy to bring with all the time.  Never be caught without a camera.  The build:  Very solid and well built.  When ever I pick it up I think, \"Leica\".  Wonderful finish, not slippery, so it won't easily slip from your hand.  I also have a Lumix G3 and by comparison the Q feels so much better.  The menu system:  Easy and logical to navigate.  As for the small sensor.  I don't enlarge my photos to huge sizes.  And I'm not a pixel peeper, so I am totally satisfied with the quality of the images.  I always shoot raw and do minor tweaking in Photo Shop Elements.  I couldn't be happier with this camera.  Thank you Pentax.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "wow. just wow.", "Author": "E. Tucker", "ReviewID": "R3F9Z80KEBJ37R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First and foremost. Order a couple extra batteries.  Small size = less battery life.  Here is the genuine retail packaged one from amazon with a great price.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WTWLHO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B000WTWLHO&linkCode;=as2&tag;=stupisms-20That being said....Q system was obviously designed with future in mind: it started as an idea that sensor tech will become so advanced in time that the size and bulk of the system will become a crucial differentiator in choosing a camera and lenses when people intend to enjoy photography more and on more regular basis.Thus an aspect of the Q system camera I particularly like is this: a Q7 camera body, together with all 7 lenses issued to far, weighs only: 499 grams. Add 30 grams for two batteries and a card, and you have a capable entire system that weighs less than many entry level DSLR bodies alone and costs about the medium level DSLR body alone.They say the best camera is one you have with you. That's why many use smartphones today as their cameras. But Q has a seriously better image quality, the feel and responsiveness than any smartphone, it's not a joke.We can extend previous thought and say the best camera system is one you can take with you all the time. An ad Olympus posted on your website says DSLRs are left at home 92% of the time. Well, to answer that, a Q camera and three lenses are always with me! And that whole package is smaller and lighter even than my DSLR body alone!Seriously, just 500 grams for the entire 7 lens system, and so small it can fit in a small purse, means less burden, constant companion on all trips without pick and choose, more photographs taken, more engagement with a properly designed photographic tool -- which Q really is.Because that's another aspect of the Q I believe most users like: it feels like a proper, engaging photographer's tool, despite its miniature size (it can fit in the palm). I encourages experimentation, and looking outside the box. We become better photographers not by constantly buying new cameras, but by continuously using the same camera and focusing on art of image taking.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Get Firmware update, need prime lens, not for clumsy fingers or memories.", "Author": "Tel-Sub-One", "ReviewID": "R3KZZHQQZQ1NDQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Cons: Small camera. Battery Life. Fingers in the way of buttons until you know where to hold camera, a camera case helps. Flimsy #02 zoom lens build. Factory firmware blows (it made camera slow to focus and shoot). To many menus. Lens choices (only 6) all flimsy. Should have bought it in white.Pros: Small camera \"007-ish\". The body is built well, cheap price for what you get. Firmware updates make all the difference! Picture quality as good or better than both my Canon A95 and A3300 (ignoring the megapixel). So many settings, filters, and Pentax-Q adapters! It comes in black!The factor firmware almost made me returned the camera and buy a fuji/nikon/canon. Then I remembered the price of the other cameras... over $400 bucks!With the original firmware it made recording video quirky. The camera would not record till it focused perfectly. Also you need to reformat SD card completely for smooth recording.New Firmware fixed all these problems :) Much smoother and faster shooting in auto. It had problems with medium brown golden skin tones. But when set to center weight it helps with this. Focuses faster. Light and dark skin tones are not a problem for AI face recognition sensor after the firmware upgrade.Battery life is 30-40mins on... OUCH! Buy extra quality batteries with more mAH like over a 1000mAh. Might be able to get an extra 20minutes out of them.It's small but if you have nimble fingers and a good memory you should be fine (I don't) but I still got use to it.I bought a leather case that screws on to the tripod mount hole. This helped a lot with holding and shooting.Resolution was great although i like my Canon A95/A3300 cameras. The Pentax was faster. But not as fast as a Nikon V or J or Fuji.It has great presets and built in filters for all scenes.Like party/kids/landscape, and also ND Filter.The #02 zoom lens is clear but somewhat usable and/or enjoyable. It is cheaply made. Pentax should have let 3rd party companys like Tamron, Agfa, Tiffin, Rokinon... ect. make the lens. Then you have options for lens quality.This camera deserves better lens options.If u need a lens options the best is the Standard #01 prime lens 40.5mm diameter. Team this up with 2x or 3x Telephoto screw on and .45x wide lens. Or a #06 Telephoto Zoom 15-45mm F2.8. That is all you need.Lots of adapter options for q-mount like Pentax K-mount, or M42 (42mm x 1mm thread) for screw on lens and microscope adapter,  or T2 (42mm x 0.75) for astrophotography telescope eyepieces. Even C/CS to Q-mount cine adapters.Of course all the major brand adapters ie Nikon F-mount, Minolta and more.So bring your lenses over!", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing little camera.", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R1Y7L6EAQOJOFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased both the 02 and 06 zoom lenses and the K/KP adapter with the camera.
