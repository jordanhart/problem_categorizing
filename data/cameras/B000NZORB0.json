I was pleasantly surprised to find out they come with interchangeable faceplates, which made it easy to customize them for each kid. My only complaint is that Amazon doesn't carry the other colors of this camera. For people worried about the picture quality: it's for a toddler. So far, ours have shown no interest in actually seeing the pictures they took. The real purpose of these is so they leave our camera alone! :)", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1.3 megapixels with 1.8\" color screen\nConnector cables for TV or PC hook-up\nSD card slot for extra memory\n16 MB internal memory that stores 200+ photos or up to 5 minutes of video\nThree preschool games for added fun", "Name": "VTech Kidizoom Plus Digital Camera - Blue", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CLkBLiJ8L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000NZORB0"}}
