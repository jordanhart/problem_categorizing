The best digital portrait camera in existence. Don't be fooled by the camera's 3.5MP rating--that is non-interpolated--all other digital camera manufactures, including all DSLRs, list only interpolated resolutions as their MP rating. This inflates other cameras' MP rating by a factor of 3 times relative to the SD-9, since they count each Red, Green, and Blue sensor as a sigle \"pixel.\" The SD-9 counts a full set of three sensors, one Red, one Green, and one Blue, as a single \"pixel.\"  Foveon.com claims the SD-9's image quality bests film for any given capture area, and approaches medium format film quality for enlargements up to 40 inches. Some report that sharp enlargements up to 8 feet on the long side are possible from the SD-9's interpolated 14MP output files. The camera's software is the best available.  The SD-9 always works losslessly, so be sure to compare only RAW mode specs when comparing to other DSLR's operating speed and convenience of workflow. Price is amazingly low for a DSLR with so many sensors, now below [$$$]...Hopefully Amazon.com will match them soon.Not the best DSLR for low light--low light noise is a  weakness. Still, can produce very fine low light/night pics with experience.", "Date": "July 12, 2003"}, {"Title": "The sharpest images you can produce", "Author": "Peter A. Stavrakoglou", "ReviewID": "R3O689TRDFWGRT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a bit late in writing this review since I've had my SD9 for one year.The image quality of photos using the SD9 can be quite stunning.  The level of sharpness achieved by the Foveon sensor is amazing - it can resolve detail that Bayer sensor cameras (all other digital cameras fall into this group) simply cannot.  Couple this camera with one of Sigma's \"EX\" lenses, particularly the super-sharp 50mm EX macro lens, and you'll love the results.  I enjoy macro photography and this camera is excellent at macro photography.I'm certainly not in the league of a real photographer as I'm just a casual type who enjoys taking pictures.  As they say, the proof is in the picture and I've seen the proof!  Forget about the megapixel rating and the fact that the Sigma is \"only\" 3.4 MP.  The Foveon sensor has 3.4 million photosensors for each primary color - that's 10.2 total MP - while a 6 MP Bayer sensor has 6 MP for all three primary colors.Why a four star rating rather than five?  This camera is not without it's issues, like all cameras.  The SD9 is not a very good low-light performer.  If you need ISO speeds faster than 100 then the SD9 may not be for you.  High ISO shots are noisy although you can get very usable high ISO photos if the conditions are ideal.  The SD10 addressed this issue.  The SD9 does not have a built-in flash but those units are not suitable for serious flash work anyway.  This camera can only use Sigma SA mount lense so the choice in lenses is not as wide as for a Canon, Nikon, or Minolta user but Sigma makes some very, very good lenses and they certainly offer more choices than I can avail myself of.  If you want in-camera jpg files, look elsehwere.  The SD9 shoots only in RAW format and you have to process the photos.  This is actually the best way to shoot, there is so much that can be done with a RAW file that one cannot do with a TIFF or jpg.  The Sigma Photo Pro software is a gem of an application that is extremely powerful and easy to use.Again, look at the results and you'll see that this camera is an extremely capable performer.", "Date": "January 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "amazing picture quality", "Author": "J.

Period!", "Author": "Alex Vox", "ReviewID": "R3RVDN22NLIURO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, this camera is something special and I have been  compelled write this review because of couple of reasons. For the first, here the reasons. I read many bad , negative reviews of this camera and in the same time all those people who actually used it told how much they have being amazed by the picture quality it produces. So I've decided to try. The camera's images are not amazed they are stunned. The image quality is so high that it left me speechless for the first.I'm just wandering about those who left negative reviews about it? The CNET review, that named it \"mediocre SLR camera\" is just a plain lie. In my opinion they giving point for those who gives more money, it's it. Another interesting \"review\", I read from Ken Rockwell (really gifted photo artist!, no questions!), who reviewed this camera without even try it!So let start. First of all, it is NOT 3.5M camera. It is AT LEAST 10M camera, but megapixels in the traditional meaning just are not applicable here. This camera produces NEGATIVES. This negative is result of 10M photo elements. In the same time any of 6M cameras has HALF OF THEM GREEN and ONLY 25% red and another 25% blue. If we speak about \"image quality\" using this kind of \"resolution\" , this camera produces 14M images. In the same time the \"real\" resolution of those \"6M\" cameras stand about 1.5M, the everything else is a pure deceiving interpolation. I see that Cannon and NIkon, aren't  happy to see this Sigma on the market, since it MUCH SUPERIOR to any camera they make they started to discredit it.I do not say it is an ideal, but it close. Much closer than everything else that feels like SLR.This Sigma produces PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES. I mean it. There's full range of amazing continuos beautiful halftones as you can see on the best reversible films. The pictures are spectacular.Since it is real photographic tool, you come back to the true that photography and it is about light. Your raw pictures will normally produce 3000 by 4500 huge images that is not interpolating, they just \"enlargements\" from digital negative. It reviles as many details that ANY other camera can't produce. There are 14M cameras on the market, but they DO NOT MUCH this SIgma in the meaning of photography. I can blow my raw image 4 times more and it still looking better than those from 14M Canon. By the way, those image from Cannon show horrible color reproduction, especially in the red. For example two closely colored redish colors coming out the same!This Sigma saves colors! It saves the real colors, not the estimations, not the interpolations but the real thing. Camera has just the everything that it has to have, including the high speed synchronization up to 1/6000 !!!The lens from Sigma just as good(or better) as any other lenses from Nikon , Cannon or Minolta. Even cheap $100 tag slow glass is of very good optical quality. Yes/ for $100 you're getting slow lenses, but it almost distortion free and high contrast! But fro $300 you can get perfectly fast, noticeably bright zoom that at least as good as any lens from \"leading companies\".Camera is very well constructed, it handles as it should be, the focusing system is fast, the screen is bright and clear, all controls location are very clever and logical. I like this camera and you're going to like it too. No boundaries anymore. You can print image as large as you need, no questions. In two, three years Foveon will overcome.

Before this I owned a run of the mill Olympus D-490.Wow, what a difference. I've been snapping away for over 2 weeks with this little gem and am shocked at the picture quality. It's amazing what a little jump in technology can do. This X3 chip produces great color, fantastic detail and it's easy enough to have running in minutes, providing you have all the batteries, and it takes alot. The downsides are that it's heavy, like a couple of pounds w/ the lens and flash (sold separately). It's expensive, try shelling out 1.5k USD and telling your wife it's for a camera. Ouch.It requires Sigma software - I think if your going to charge an arm and a leg for a camera, it should take images in a standardized format. I appreciate the fact that the images in \"sigma\" format are infinitely manipulatable, but geesh. At least give us a choice if we want all that control in every shot.The pics cant be blown up very much. Now as an aside, I'm no master with the software yet, but on Hi quality with autofocus on the darn thing makes great pics, but viewing at anything over 2:1 magnification in Paint Shop produces pixelated images. It's a quirk, but it matters to me. Other than that, like I said, images are great. It's fun to run because it's so much like a pro-shot camera, but still easy enough for the average PHD to run it.

Seattle customer, is it correct to infer that your opinion is not based on actually trying the camera? As I understand it, the Foveon image sensor in the SD9 is different from the sensors in the 6 megapixel cameras you refer to in that each pixel in the SD9 is capable of sensing either red, blue, or green light, whereas in the conventional sensors any given pixel can only sense one color. That means it takes three pixels in a conventional sensor to provide the true color data provided by one pixel in the Foveon sensor. There may be more pixels in an image from a 6 mp sensor, but many of those pixels are artificially created by computer interpolation rather than being based on direct sensing of incoming light. Also this means the conventional camera must take more time to process the image in camera.", "Date": "November 11, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good start by Sigma, but probably better to wait", "Author": "Ofeliawotsits", "ReviewID": "R19PE817VUBNZJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Sigma uses a new kind of light collecting chip which senses R,B,G colours at each of the 3.4 million pixels on its chip. The more common chip used by all other cameras senses only one colour at each pixel. So the Sigma should win hands down! Not necessarily. 3.4Mp isn't many pixels. Sony, Nikon et al. have 6Mp cameras using the standard type sensor. At the end of the day, more pixels give better resolution. So a 6Mp sensor does as well as the Sigma 3Mp sensor for colour and resolution.Fuji has tweaked the standard sensor format to use hexagonal pixels and get better resolution out of their 6Mp sensor chip. In August 2002 the Fuji S2 pro is due out, and its 6Mp chip will produce 12Mp photos. That's 12 million pixels of info to make a photo. They do this by analysing the data from the 6Mp and modifying it to \"fill in\" extra detail and colour. The result to Joe bloggs on the street will be photos pretty close to ordinary 35mm quality.If Sigma produce a camera using their new technology chip but with 6Mp, then it will be a force to reckon with.Slight problems with Sigma are you have to use their lenses. The Fuji is made to use Nikon lenses. Canon and Nikon have their own equivalents to the Fuji.Personally I'm waiting for the Fuji S2 Pro as I already have a Nikor AF auto-focus lens which I'm not ready to pass up. The Fuji is going to cost less than its Canon/Nikon counterparts...", "Date": "April 26, 2002"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000063YA4"}}
