To be perfectly clear, this is not a high-end system with high definition cameras, but it isn't priced like a high-end system either. This is a budget system that exceeded my expectations for what you get and how well it works. Here are my observations:Our Use - We recently bought an old but very large building for my wife's business and needed a way to monitor the six exits and the retail shop space.Included:* Main Control Unit - this is a fairly small unit (smaller than most DVD players) that is has button access for most functions* 8-Cameras - these are also fairly small, good physical quality and include mounting hardware* USB Mouse - connects to Control Unit* Remote Control - gives access to all menu functions (batteries included)* Required Cables - 60' Video/Power cables* Power Supplies -  one for the Control Unit and two for the cameras (uses splitters to distribute the power between the cameras)* Instruction Manual* Software CD* Hard Drive Mounting Screws (Hard Drive not included)Features:+ Camera; IR Illumination for night vision+ User configurable Options; Privacy Zones (blackout areas in the display), Motion Zones (areas where motion triggers an alarm)+ Network Access; Can be viewed on local network using Internet Explorer (required allowing ActiveX and would not work with Firefox) and remotely via a DDNS service (often an extra expense for a reliable service)+ Alarm Notification; Audible alert and E-Mail capability+ Display Options; Includes a VGA monitor connection and BNC/video out for TV viewing (we use Q-See QSRCBN6 6 Pack RCA-BNC Connectors)+ Remote Control; Really makes it easy to quickly access featuresPros:+ Setup; Basic configuration is surprisingly easy+ Image Quality; Good enough for basic security needs in both bright and dark settings (but see \"Cons\" below)+ Value; Lots of cameras and features at a reasonable cost+ Options; Can be made to do everything we need it to doCons:- No Hard Drive; Can use external USB drive or add your own Hard Drive to add recording capabilities (we installed Western Digital Caviar Blue 500 GB SATA III 7200 RPM 16 MB Cache Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive - WD5000AAKX in less than ten minutes)- Washed Out Colors; Colors are somewhat muted, but can be individually adjusted in the controls to get the best possible picture for the lighting conditions- Night Vision; Limited range, less than 20'Hints/Notes:* With the Hard Drive installed, Alarmed Events can be recorded and searched on later* A 500GB Hard Drive can record 168 hours of video (according to the manual)* Placing a camera too close to a window will cause the IR to reflect and blind the camera when it shifts into night vision mode* Display can be set to show 1, 4, or 8 video feeds at a timeThis system covered my needs very well and provides a lot of advanced features that were unexpected in a budget system.Highly Recommended!CFH", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product for the money", "Author": "M A Sletten", "ReviewID": "R2V85YY3FKF23K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Simple to hookup.  Plenty of cameras.  Lots of options to monitor.  Quality seems good (everythings from China).  The manual can be a little hard to read and lacking, but it covers the basics.You get 8 cameras.  Daytime range and color is good.  IR range at night is pretty limited, maybe 20 feet.  If you are just covering a door or hallway it works pretty well.  I have one in the garage and you couldn't see much of anything at night without an extra illuminator and a couple more outside for the driveway and yard area and they are completely useless at night.  Probably need to supplement with a motion light or some other means.The DVR comes without a HD.  I added a 500GB, which was a simple task.  The user interface is adequate and simple enough to figure out.  There are two BNC type video outputs.  I got some adapter plugs from Monoprice to convert to a RCA type plug so I could plug into a TV input.  It also comes with software that you can install on your computer to monitor the DVR remotely over your home network.  That works really nice and lets you make all the adjustments to the DVR settings from any networked computer without having to be connected directly to the DVR (except for the first time setup of course).  Not much for instructions on how to use the s/w though, so you have to wing it on your own.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad model - avoid", "Author": "kkaz", "ReviewID": "R178DPJYIA3VW1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I own five Zmodo units working in different buildings for 2+ years, so after one of my evicted tenants decided to steal it, this was the best price I could find. After we tried to install two different hard drives (WD and Seagate, both 500GB), we discovered that this particular DVR model (D9108BH) has one fatal flaw: it doesn't recognize a hard drive after a hard restart. Apparently, when a power is lost during HDD writing operations, the file system is messed up to such a degree that the operating system is incapable of dealing with this mess. Power goes down every week in S. Florida, so we cannot afford to dismantle the unit and reformat the hard drive in a computer every time it happens. We returned it.Some thoughts to share with those who may consider purchasing a similar system:1) As far as my experience with other, older units is concerned: they need to be connected via a surge protector because otherwise they die very quickly, being very sensitive to voltage fluctuations. We have them all hooked via UPS, so a thief wouldn't benefit from a simple act of switching the power off.2) Cameras have a random short life, and the quality of picture deteriorates significantly in the first two months (which you discover when you replace those which died, and compare pictures from new and old cameras). We have to replace 10% of cameras every year.3) Cables are of poor quality, they need to be tested before installation and treated like a rotten egg during installation. Make sure you install them in the right direction - check the power plugs before you install, they are different on two sides! Don't cover them until the system is tested, because at the end there is always at least one cable that doesn't work and needs to be re-wired. The connectors are prone to corrosion, and they loose electrical connection in a matter of months, so most service calls boil down to cleaning the cable connections.4) The setup of the DVR unit  is as counter-intuitive as it gets. What we normally need is a silent system that would record video for several seconds from those cameras which detected motion, while watching all the time. Sounds simple? You won't find it in the manual, and it's not the default configuration in most of these units. Some settings overlap in different menus of the setup, and you never know which one overrides the other.5) Manuals are seldom pertinent to the model they came with, and they don't address the normal setup issues we normally see.6) Sound. We hide the DVRs in inaccessible locations, to prevent stealing them by thieves, so one more inherent flaw of all of them is the buzzer which goes off whenever anything happens: a camera was disconnected, power was connected, etc. The only way to silence the buzzer is to physically destroy it with pliers - I am not kidding, we have already tried all menu options with Zmodo support. The buzzer is sometimes well-hidden inside the front panel mainboard.7) Hard drives tend to overheat in those units which do not have fans.8) Most units come without hard drives; however, you may have a hard time finding any disclosure of the fact prior to the purchase.9) Once something happens, you would probably need to convert the video files i.e. in the convenient AVI format. With the software Zmodo provided, It takes half a day to convert these video files into any common format, and it is very inflexible, and doesn't support batching files.We overcome all the technical difficulties, because we have boxes full of replacement cameras and cables from several units which died, and we spent enough time with the Zmodo tech support (average waiting time 20-30 minutes - nice folks), to learn how to set it up.One major advantage of having a surveillance system is recording criminal activity, which is quite common in Liberty City, where they are installed. The video is not of good quality but it can tell you, what items the perpetrators touched, so the fingerprints theoretically could be taken from these items in order to identify the thieves, (if the police ever cared to take the fingerprints). I.e. in our case, we had half-an-hour footage of the theft of the AC unit, where one of the thieves unscrewed a light bulb in front of one of the cameras. The trouble was, the police (NW Miami Dade) took two weeks to arrive to collect fingerprints (which were gone by then) and they disregarded the video, which we converted for them into the convenient AVI format (this is another issue - it takes half a day to convert these video files into any common format with the software Zmodo provided). The police officer in charge of the case did not know how (or did not want?) to open AVI video files, so they have never even tried to use them to solve the case. We printed and posted fliers containing the best still pictures (surprisingly good, including tatoos on the bodies) captured from these videos, and one of our neighbors recognized the perps, but was too afraid to speak up, so we only learned about it one year later. No surprise given the quality and speed of the Miami-Dade police.These systems are useless in rain, so when the next time the house was burglarized in the middle of a rainy night, we didn't get any footage. Generally, in the night, the video quality of these cameras deteriorates very badly, so we learned to install them paired with motion spot lamps (the cheap solar ones from Harbor Freight). Also, they cover a very narrow field of vision (approximately 20 degrees regardless of the claims written in specs) and the resolution is good up to approximately 20-30 feet in a bright day, so you need at least 8 of them to cover an average small house, and it takes a lot of design to place them right.Update: We returned these and ordered two Zmodo units from Newegg instead. Newegg sent us the same model D9108BH, which exhibited the same flaw: after the power was turned down and up, the hard drive was not recognized any more, not even available for formatting.One more update: Another disadvantage came up to my attention when one of my systems recorded a murder next door. Police detective made me dig the DVR out from the attics, and rented the unit for one month, and months later I got a subpoena to the court, which is extremely inconvenient for someone who is abroad every week, and who has not really witnessed anything.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Happy", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "RRA4FAC4P6Q5B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this system DVR works great easy to set up, cameras are poor quailty, colors are way off If you expect correct color get different cameras. green looks pink.

I love the eight cameras and had everything up and running in a few minutes.  My tech friend suggested I temporary install it all and just leave the wires laying on the floor and experiment with placement, etc.  So I did this over several weeks.  I put mine in a secure location and connected the video out on the DVR to my big screen in the family room for faster checks of the live video using a 150 ft video/pwr/aud cord off of Amazon for $15.  The instruction book is translated from chinese and of course has broken english and jargon lost in the translation, but its not as bad as other reviewers have noted.  It came with the default of recording 24 hours a day but I changed this to just recording motion, which makes a search so much faster.  It took two weeks to get a feel for it.  I learned more from reading the reviews on Amazon then in the manual.  Never had to call tech support yet, but they seem good if you get the domestic staff (from the reviews).The unit first arrived without the 500 GB hard drive in the DVR, but Amazon replaced the whole system in a timely fashion.PRO: Great eight camera unit for the price.  It works fine, the IR works to spec's.  I combine the IR Cams with an extra IR Spot Lite, from Amazon for less than ten dollars to increase visiability I'm still experimenting with it but other reviewers had good luck with it. The second box of 4 cameras has a spare 12 volt power unit that I am using for the lights.CON: Wish I had the 16 camera unit now.Modification:  I will combine the whole unit to a UPS which should keep it going during power failures for some time since the normal monitor attached to the VGA output is turned off and on an outlet not connected to the UPS.  Now that \"cloud storage is readily available\", off site storage is easier.  I may also ad a few false cameras to give it a beefer look.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent DVR and cameras; Directions and manual leave much to be desired", "Author": "Eldho Thomas", "ReviewID": "RCTFBXKHBFFOJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received it a day ago and I am still playing with it. I will update my review as I learn more about it.As of now, I am giving it 4 stars. I had to take one star away for the cheap look and lack of clear information and directions on the website and the manual. The grammar in the manual is bad. Confusing, with too many typos. It is unfortunate that someone can make such a good device, but cannot write a good, clear manual. Other than that, It works pretty well. I have connected all the 8 cameras and spread them out on a bed. All of them are working. Picture quality is decent. It is not perfect, but more than enough for the purpose (security monitoring).Disappointment : It can't use an external HDD for recording. There was no information about this anywhere. May be it is assumed that everyone knows that external HDDs cannot be used for DVRs. But, I was hoping I could do that with this unit. Since, it doesn't recognize my external HDD and since there is no mention of it anywhere, I am concluding that it expects an SATA HD to be installed inside. No big deal, except for the extra expense.The Good: Connect the cameras, connect the mouse, connect a monitor through VGA and switch it on. It works. You can view all the 8 cameras on a 3x3 matrix on the monitor.The Bad: The interface looks cheap. The mouse feels cheap. I think, as companies struggle to cut corners, cheapness is something that we have to live with in the future, when it comes to equipment and appliances. Again, no big deal as long as I save some money and this thing doesn't die for a few years.Yet to try out: SATA HDD is on order. I haven't tried out the recording and motion sensing. I haven't tried out the web interface. I will post updates.I love it so far.Update (after 15 days):-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I still love it. I still have it spread around on the bed with the cameras pointing in all directions. I want to test it fully before mounting it in its place. All the functions work as they should be except for some quirks, mainly due to user-unfriendliness.Added a 2TB HD (Western Digital AV-GP WD20EURS). The device detected it fine and formatted it and ended with a loud continuous annoying beep. Not sure what the beep was for, but as annoying as it was, I had no option but to switch off the device. Anyway, the hard drive seems to be working after the restart.I was able to get it set up for recording on motion-detection. That was a challenge by itself. Out of the box, the device is set up with manual record on. I had to switch it off before the scheduled recording would take over. On scheduled recording, there are options such as \"Record always\", \"Record on motion\", \"Record on alarm\" or \"Record on motion or alarm\". Schedule can be set up at hourly level for a whole week. It is pretty neat.I got it connected to network. The network interface is nice. Better than the interface on the monitor (directly connected to the device). I can see that the ActiveX control is a bit heavy. I was able to install the ActiveX control and log in on local network, but from a corporate network I could not log in. I think there is some security stuff that the corporate firewall doesn't like. They should make this authentication a bit simpler.I have an e-mail alert set up now. You have to add a DNS server before e-mails can be sent (if your smtp server is a name, not IP address).Still to try : Mobile access; Durability etc.This is my project of the year. Still love it.Update after 40 days : Disappointed by camera angle~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I am installing it in its final resting place and mounting the cameras. I have to say the cameras are a disappointment. I am ok with the clarity and color that many people have complained about. My major complaint is that it is very narrow-angle. If you are planning to mount it indoor, be aware that you are not going to be able to see much of the room. You need a bit more wider angled cameras for that purpose. Even outdoor, you are going to miss a huge area closer to the camera. For any serious surveillance, you will need wider angled cameras.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad for price", "Author": "jaxonj", "ReviewID": "R1L2K83XGVLDH0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For half the price of the Swann system which I guess has high definition cameras you probably get about the same options. I have mine hooked to a tv and I can clearly make out faces good enough to prosecute out to about 10 feet. After that face clarity is not so great but all the surroundings are still pretty clear. The colors however are not so great. On some things the colors are true but on others they are off, like my blue car is blue but my blue hoodie is pinkish, the green stripe on my boat is green but the grass and leaves are brownish. The clarity is more exact than the colors.  I cut and spliced several of the wires to reach some of the cameras and I can't see any real difference between the ones I didn't splice. Maybe a little but not really. Night vision is pretty good in a circle in the middle of the viewing area (not the whole screen)area out to 15 feet or so. The system is a little glitchy but not bad. Some of the commands don't effect the system the way you would expect. There are several options that are supposed to effect camera motion and alarm but I have found the best way to control motion is to go into system, click video, go to channel, set specific camera, then go to motion and click low, med, high, or disable and exit and save. This method allows you to go per channel or all...There are many other ways that are supposed to work but I had a lot of trouble at first...I had a boot problem because I set settings before I hit the hard drive format button. I was told to unplug everything for a minute and then format first. Now everything works. Tech support was very helpful. So once I found a way that worked I haven't tried any other ways. One thing to note is the motion censor is very sensitive even on low. It used about 25 GB's (all 8 channels) through the night apparently on moths, and during the day whatever moved on the street or when leaves blow it would record. At that rate it would go through 500GB's every ten days and I'm not sure how overwrite effects quality so I turned  off motion record except for when I am expecting a package or when I leave the house, but as long as you don't turn off power to the system you still get a view from the cameras.  Any way, motion works good, alarm works good...very nice for when you are expecting a package...mine were getting stolen off my porch...hence the system...(God bless the welfare system)...You will certainly be able to see what is going on around your property and for 260 (I purchased Blue Caviar 500 gb hd for 60) it is hard to beat this set up. However I am probably going to get two more high def  wide angle cameras for my porch where my packages are left for extra clarity. If you have lots of money go with the 500 system with the high def cameras, other wise this deal is pretty good with a lot of options. I recommend it for the financially impaired or for basic surveillance of your property.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "John Preble \"UCM Museum Director\"", "ReviewID": "RIIY6QSHCT15G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am using 6 cameras so far.

I tried to exchange my cmos cameras with the Sharp chip for the Sony ccd chip cameras. I was told I would have to pay the difference of $90 to exchange them.

The night vision is no good if it's completely dark - you need a light - even a small one and then it works. The throw for night vision is only about 15'. Not good at all. The color was bad until we adjusted the cables and watched it change every time we moved them. We got them to be adequate. Resolution - adequate for the price.
