Very Fast..As such this is a great deal with 18-55mm and 55-300mm lenses, and the product description page doesn't say anything else other than the camera and lenses, I was pleasantly surprised to find the following additional goodies as part of the package:1. Nikon School DVD2. Nikon DSLR Bag3.

By amatuer i mean anyone not getting paid by National Geographic or the MLB people. All of the functions on these dslr's a re very nice. in the past you would have had to figure out all these varying settings with light meters and f/stops.I still will use a light meter and set my own f/stops with this rig. Just because i understand all the functions well. I would reccomend anyone who has this camera to take a class if this is your first camera. there are soo many features it would be impossible for a first or maybe even a second time camera user to figure them all out. It's amazing what microprocessors have done in the last few years.The other fabulous thing about these types of camera's is to get the most memory and highest rated recording cards so you can fire away at will and then just delete what you don't like or want. In the past, one would have to pay for processing and see what happened and have many pics you didn't like or want. I will eventually get 1000mm lens as well. but for now this was quite the deal for the camera and two lenses. It's been replaced with the 5200 24 megapixel since the new year, but if you can find one of these and are looking for great camera and great deal... here it is..... and use the hood.. that's why they put it in with the lens.... :) good luck and enjoy this camera if you choose...", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon D5100", "Author": "Christmas Story fan", "ReviewID": "RI6LL6T62U7ZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this camera after seeing all the good reviews and were very happy when we received it. We were very pleased to get a camera bag, tripod, cleaning solution, 32 GB card, etc. with the camera which hadn't been advertised when we bought it! After using it the first time we came home and found the little \"door\" that protects the battery was gone. I have no idea how it could have fallen off, but I contacted \"Beach Camera\" to see if I could get a replacement door, and they were very nice about it and ask me to send the camera back.  They then sent me a whole new camera with everything I had received before. {There was some reason they couldn't just replace the door.} My husband and I love this camera; it takes excellent photos and is everything we hoped it would be. We aren't pros so we got a couple of books for the Nikon D5100 and are studying them so we can learn all there is to learn about it. We're going on vacation soon and hope to bring back some great photos!

Maybe a lot of that has to do with the newer, and probably better quality lenses that I now have, but in features alone, this camera does everything the D100 did, better, and does so much more.I have enjoyed some of the built in program modes (i.e. portrait, sports, scenery, ect.), I still have full creative control over the exposure when I want it. There are a lot of menu's and sub-menu's that you have to learn) to get at the heart of the camera, and there is certainly a learning curve, but nothing overwhelming for those familiar with Nikon cameras. I am still learning more, every time I pick the camera up, and try something new.One of my passions, has always been storm photography, and meteor shower photography, and I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, with my experience with digital, long exposure results. Noise was an absolute killer in the D100, and I have had that nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach, ever since I switched to digital. Would I ever be able to capture meteors, lightening, and other celestial events, with a digital camera, like I did with film?The answer to that question is an astoundingly loud, YES. The internal noise reduction of the Nikon D5100 is amazing. I have done 15\" exposures of the sky just after sunset, with amazing results, capturing a passing meteor with no problems using an ISO of 200. After some time, as the sky darkened, I kicked it up to ISO 400, with that tense knot in my stomach, worried about the amount of noise it would create. I did not want to take longer exposures, so the ISO was the only option to capture more light. To my absolute delight, the photos retain the color, sharpness, with little or no color shift, and comparing photos side by side, or transposing, I see only stars, and the planets that rose with the night sky. Very little, if any, noise at all.This camera has the exact same sensor, as it's more expensive big brother, the D7000, for half the price. It only has 11 focal points, but they are in enough area's of the frame, to do more than enough to keep you happy. I have found that you lose a lot of creative control, by using the default focus settings, which use multiple points, to arrange the composition, leaving you with a strangely, just out of focus, scene, nothing is quite sharp, nor blurry. I tend now to use only single focal points, to give me greater control over accuracy, and depth of field (f/stop, focus depth).I have only begun to scratch the surface of this camera, and it's capabilities. I was sad to see the D5200 announced, only days after I purchased this model, but when I look at the specs, side by side, there is not much offered on the newer model, that I can't live with out.A camera is a tool, and it is really only bound by your desire to explore new ways of shooting. I have serious doubts that I will ever outgrow the capability of this camera, it will die, long before that happens. If they can do so much now, I wonder what the future will bring?Nikon hit a home run with this camera, and I am glad that my trusty old D100 died, giving me the opportunity to buy this kit, and re-ignite my passion for low light photography.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hubby loves it", "Author": "nfnanners1970", "ReviewID": "R23BZFO4VW88AS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera takes amazing pics.
