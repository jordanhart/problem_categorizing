After all, the Alpha 300 is a 200 with Live View, or a 350 with 10 megapixels instead of 14mp.  Right?Well, pretty much that's the case.  But there is also a corresponding price difference.  Is Live View worth an extra $100?  Is 14mp worth an extra $200?For my money, yes, Live View is worth the $100 because of the way Sony has implemented this feature.  Unlike most systems, you won't see a loss in autofocusing performance (or a loss of autofocus completely), nor will you alter the way the exposure and white balance are determined.  Add to this the articulated screen that makes extremely low or high angle shots easier, and I say \"YES\"!  Any drawbacks?  Yes, this screen is a bit thicker, and pushes you back a bit when looking through the camera.  Also, the way Sony implements Live View does mean you only see 90 percent of what you'll get on the image.OK, is 14mp worth the extra $200?  I don't know, but I don't think so.  We really need more critical comparisons from people with true scientific methods of measuring the difference in image quality, but there are a few assumptions that will probably hold true, based on previous cameras.  The 14mp will give a superior image in good lighting, when ISO values (the fake \"film\" speeds) can be set to higher quality settings.  You won't see this difference on an 8x10 standard photo, but probably could in very big enlargements or severe cropping of photos.  Keep in mind that the \"1.4x and 2x teleconverter\" option you have with Live View is nothing more than cropping, with 2x dropping your effective megapixels in half.Past cameras would suggest, however, that the higher pixel density of the 14mp camera would be a drawback in low light conditions, in particular when we have to raise the ISO settings.  Thus, they may not even be as good as the 10mp sensor for these applications (but we still need critical testing to confirm this assumption).So, for my money, I'd say the 14mp is probably not worth the money for someone shooting an even variety of shoots, but might be for a landscape/wildlife photographer.Compared to other brands, I think the Alpha 300 wins on features compared to the Canon Digital Rebel XTi or Nikon D60 (Live View, stabalization in body).  The new 12mp Canon XSi is more in the price range of the 14mp Alpha 350.  In any case, with 3 new Alphas, and the new D60 and XSi, there's no more excuses!

Like another reviewer said, I think the a300 hits the sweetspot.  The Live view is a feature that I might have to add to my list of requirements for future upgrades.One of the things that annoyed me about shooting with a dslr were my glasses.  To prevent them from being smudged, I'd flip them up when pressing my face against the eyepiece.  Spend an entire day doing this and it becomes a royal PITA.  I've only used the camera for about a week so far and I can already see that I'll be relying on Live view a lot.The other major benefits of Live view are: 1) being able to shoot pics from the ground level perspective (great for kids and dogs) without multiple trial and errors or crouching/laying on the ground (my back thanks me), and 2) shooting over a crowd of heads, fence, glass partition, etc.The image doesn't track as smooth as I'd hoped, but it's good enough for framing the shot.  It shows you the autofocus points as well as providing a live histogram (i love it!).I upgraded from a Minolta 5D and I think I'll miss the depth of field preview as well.  Small price to pay for all the other great features.In summary, get this camera if you're not heavily invested in other lens systems.  I haven't checked out the competition since I'm one of the surviving members of the Minolta clan, but I'm sure others have competent implementations as well.", "Date": "May 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Lives up to high expectations. Great entry-level+ DSLR.", "Author": "Robert Correll", "ReviewID": "R19T6R1DXR6T93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first DSLR, and I am very satisfied.Why I bought it:Live View - excellent implementation. This was my number one purchase point for this camera.  Fast switching to and from the Optical Viewfinder. You can use Live View outside of the studio and it acts just like a standard consumer digital camera screen. Screen tilts, which is handy.10MP - this is the sweet spot for price and capability. The Alpha 350 has 14MP, but I decided to save the money and buy a few accessories right away.RAW+JPEG - I wanted a camera that shot RAW+JPEG and didn't skimp on the JPEG. You can shoot high-quality JPEG and RAW at the same time.Great photos - has to do that.Good surprises after I got the camera and started using it:Ease of Use - very easy to start using right out of the box (recharge the battery first).Steady Shot - gives me the confidence to shoot without a tripod and it has a nice readout on the LCD that tells you when you're shaking.Battery life - I've been taking quite a few photos the last week and have yet to recharge the internal battery.Display Button - easy to press and review your photos. Very easy to get back to shooting.Minor Bad Point - in-camera flash is very low and kit lens casts a shadow if you are too close to your subject. I got an HVL-F36AM external flash with the camera so I don't have to worry about this too much.Some mention that the viewfinder is small, but I used it all day today because of the bright sunlight and was happy with it. I was sitting in our vehicle and noticed a tank in my side mirror. I decided to take the photo using auto focus but that didn't work, so I focused manually on the tank about 30 yards behind me through the driver's side window in the left side mirror and got a perfectly sharp picture using the Optical Viewfinder.Great camera!!", "Date": "May 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Started off pleased. I am not so pleased now.", "Author": "Ticktock \"Ticktock\"", "ReviewID": "R3NCTKP7UKSLYM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the Sony A300 5 months ago through J&R; Music World. The camera came to me quickly and with no apparent problems. Since then I have used the camera several times to take photos of my grandchildren and also some landscapes.  I always mount the camera on a sturdy tripod. When it is not being used, it is stored in a padded camera case. The last time I turned on my camera the LCD showed a white screen with just a couple of lines running through it.  I did not bang it, drop it or otherwise abuse it. The camera comes with a 1 year warranty. Since I purchased a Sony product I did not expect to have a problem with them honoring my warranty.  They gave me instructions to send it to Precision Camera Repair. After about a week I checked Precision's online repair status and I had a message saying that repairs were delayed because they were waiting for payment. When I called they told me that the camera showed some small scratches on it's base so the camera was obviously abused and therefore they would have to charge me $254 to repair it! I went ballistic. Precision's customer service person told me that maybe they could reduce the repair cost and immediately reduced the charge to $175.  Now you may say that my argument should not be with Sony. It should be with Precision Camera. However when I called Sony Customer Relations they refused to intercede and told me I was out of luck.  My argument is with Sony because they are using an obviously unscrupulous repair service.  How do I know they are unscrupulous? Because I have since found out that what they did to me, they have also done to other people.  There are many complaints about them at these websites: [...][...] Sony's Customer Relations Department turned a deaf ear to my complaint.

I did a lot of research before choosing this D-SLR and IMHO the A300 offers the best bang for the buck in its class. My decision was based on the image quality, Sony's innovative LiveView functionality, in-body stabilization, lens availability (without any confusion as to what lens is compatible, what lens is stabilized or has a focus motor...) and price.I use the LiveView and OVF interchangeably and both work very well for me (and I wear glasses). I find LV and the tiltling LCD particularly useful when using a tripod as it's no longer necessary to contort my body to the OVF to see what the camera sees; it's also very useful for candid shots and to get over peoples' heads (or fences at zoos for example). I've found the LV/tilt-LCD incredibly useful to be able to place the camera on a wall or post or less convenient spots when there's no tripod, and be able to compose and shoot a great night shot.I find the camera responsive - no complaints there - AF is fast and accurate. Metering is flexible, accurate and consistent. Battery is great - lasts a long time and with the % display, I know when I'm running low.The built-in image stabilization has saved many a shot for me where lighting was marginal - I would not want to have to do without this feature.I'm pleased with the image quality (even when I forgot to reset the ISO from 800 after some indoor/no-flash wedding shots). The camera has lots of buttons so I don't have to go searching through menus and if I do need to do something that doesn't have its own button, the Fn button generally gets me there quickly - a well thought out interface that works for me.I have the Sony 18-70 and 75-300 kit lenses and I'm happy with both as they provide great flexibility in range, and they're sharp enough for me. All in all I'm very happy with this tool and if my shots don't come out the way I expect them to, it's more likely my problem than any lens or camera limitation.Knowing what I know now about this setup, I'd definitely make the same decision to buy it.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "A true DSLR value", "Author": "WILLIAM IMHOF", "ReviewID": "R2H6BWELDEMKEQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I researched affordable DSLR cameras and chose the A300 for its rear screen viewing when desired, its 'in the camera body' anti shake system, its comfortable shape and weight, and its excellent picture clarity.

My first dSLR was the Canon D350. It took excellent pictures, but dSLRs were still evolving and I found the 1.8 inch screen too small to view, and when I viewed pics taken on it, I missed defects in photos, like out of focus areas, because of this. Thus I sold it.As an aside, I still have my film SLR Canon EOS 500 from ages ago. Took lovely photos but obviously not used anymore :)Come 2008, I felt it was time to get my feet wet again. All dSLR's have huge screens (remember the 1.5 inch ones of yesteryear?) and there are more choices than ever before.I tried to order the A300 from Amazon but they didnt ship to Singapore. I bought it from a Malaysian website instead for an equivalent price. As the camera comes with no memory card, I bought a 8GB type III compact flash card for SGD$120. I've since found ther camera is cheaper from Hong Kong. Any lucky travellers to HK wanting a Sony Alpha should go tot Mong Kok and ask around. Same for the Lens- 18-200mm was offered at HKD$3100- before any haggling!Reasons why I chose the Sony Alpha A300:1. Large LCD screen with tilt- I have loved tilting screens since I first got my Sony DSC 30 back in 2000. In fact, all my dig. cameras can tilt- Kyocera SL300R, Nikon S4, Nikon S10.2. Price (of course!)3. Longer zoom than the competitors.  I've always found lens which stop at 80mm (35mm equiv) quite useless. It's just too little zoom for most people. Thus this lens was much better. In fact, combined with the 1.4x and 2.0x zoom ability (it's a button on the top right of the back of the camera) makes it even better. Doing this does reduce resolution from 10 to 5 megapixels, but it's there if you need it.4. Good reviews from many people, including the 23 reviews on this site.5. Relatively lightweight (see below)How have I found it since?I've only taken about 50 photos, but they have been quite good. As I am not a professional photographer who views photos under an electron microscope at the subatomic level, I have no problems with the photos at all. Ones taken in the day at great. Ones taken indoors are obviously not quite as perfect, but certainly quite useable. Face detection is good, and I always have vibration reduction on too.In terms of user friendliness, It's not too bad. I can take most genral photos on auto, but I still need to consult the manual for some things, like how to zoom in when viewing taken photos.The price of the camera means that I did compare it with prosumer cameras too. Many of them were had incredible zooms, but were correspondingly heavier eg Fujifilm s100fs is almost 1kg. I used to have a Sony f828, which was also almost 1kg, and it was a hassle to carry around for lengths of time. The weight difference between the A300 with kit lens and the prosumers is very noticeable and carrying the A300 is very easy.I had intended considering the 18-200mm or 18-250mm lens, but at this stage, I dont think the weight addition offsets the benefits, especially since I can use the nifty 2.0x button I mentioned above. Obviously, using the 2.0x on a 18-200/250mm lens would be heaven itself, but for now, I'll make do :)Woah, that's a lot of writing- if you made it to the end, thanks for your patience!For the above 23 prior reviewers- thanks for your time in penning your thoughts.

I was initially blown away by the features and price, but after taking a few hundred photos, I'm quite disappointed by the photo quality. They dont seem to be as sharp as the Canon 350D I had a few years back and they seem noisy, even at 100iso. Perhaps I am doing something wrong, or I have a bad camera.

I don't use the flash much so it really doesn't bother me. The ability to preview your shots with the LCD is a nice feature, but only use it when you absolutely have to. I recently took 400 shots using only the LCD and the pictures all looked great on the LCD, but they were over/underexposed when I uploaded them to my PC. The photo quality was actually a little bit worse than the D40, which was a disappointment because of the higher megapixel. I have not bought a better lens yet, but that will fix the problem. The problem with that is I could have bought the Nikkon D60 kit for the cost of a high quality lens. I still give it 4 stars.

I upgraded my old camera hoping for a better quality pictures. The Alpha 100 had very impressive reviews at Amazon.com and that made me decide to buy the Alpha 300 with the kit.I have taken several outdoor shots for both V3 and the new alpha and compared the image side by side. The result was not a big difference as far as clarity. The picture taken by alpha was just a little bit better only because of higher mega pixel. I had a very high expectation and I'm not too happy at all. With my disappointment, I thought of returning the camera but I decided to give another try. I have read opinion of other reviewers who are not too happy either and strongly recommend the 16-80 Carl Zeiss lens. Bought this to a local store and planned to return just in case.(I'm telling you, these lens are very expensive. The price of the lens is even more expensive than the price of the camera kit).

Fadul \"Gadget Hoarder\"", "ReviewID": "R37B9IO0VSKC72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my fair share of point and shoot camera experience, dabbling in small Olympus and Pentax cameras as well as trying out more advanced, full-featured Canons, Samsungs, and Casios, but I was tired of taking mediocre pictures with compact cameras featuring small sensors. This A300 is my first digital SLR and I went through tons of research to finalize my decision on this model. The other models I considered were the Canon XS and XSi, the Olympus E510, and the Nikon D40x. The Sony Alpha 300 is a superior camera to those listed above for the following reasons:1. IN-CAMERA IMAGE STABILIZATION VIA SENSOR SHIFT. While I intended to use a tripod every now and then, I realize that my shooting will predominantly be handheld, and image stabilization is important. It roughly allows you to shoot at a shutter speeds 4 times slower than one can while holding a camera. For example if you can typically keep a camera steady for 1/40 seconds, you won't have a problem with a 1/10 shutter speed with IS on (not exactly, but a good rule of thumb). The Canon XSi had IS, but it was in the lens. IS in the lens works well, but makes the lens bulkier. With the Sony A300, you don't need to get an expensive lens with IS. That would've been the case if you go with Canons and Nikons.2. MINOLTA A-MOUNT LENS SELECTION. Yeah, yeah, I realize that Canons and Nikons have huge libraries of lenses. But the Sony Alphas have the Minolta A-mount lenses at their disposal. This means cheap lenses (featuring IS, see above) with quality lens glass. And by cheap, I mean cheap! A must-get is the Minolta Maxxum 50mm f/1.7 prime lens. When the Alphas were introduced you could get these for as cheap as $50! Now they're upwards of $100, but try finding a lens with an f/1.7 aperture for the other cameras (with IS!!!) at that price! Great lens for low light conditions. Another must-have is the Minolta beercan telephotos (I don't have it yet but it's on my shopping list!). On top of that, Sigma and Tamron both make lenses for all aperture and price ranges for the A-mount.3. LIVE VIEW AND LCD TILT. Live View may be a gimmick to some, but I feel you can be more versatile when shooting when the camera isn't pressed to your face. Shots in the air and shots close to the ground are a breeze with the tilt screen. Almost all photo magazine publications rave about the Live View that Sony Alphas have. This was one of the reasons I chose the A300 over the A200. I know that the optical viewfinder is smaller than most (around 80%?) but that doesn't bother me. The Live View feature was important enough to scratch the Nikon D40x from consideration. I suggest you go to your local electronics or camera store to see first-hand how well this camera operates.4. IMAGE QUALITY. I hear complaints that the A300 doesn't perform well in high ISO settings. I think it performs superbly. For a good picture, you'd like something under ISO400 anyway. Nikons outsource their sensors to Sony, so if Nikon cameras have great quality I would tend to believe that Sony's Alpha series won't be too shabby either. The 10MP is good enough for me. According to benchmarks, the A300 is a bit faster than the A350 at the highest resolution, but if I had the resources I wouldn't hesitate to grab the A350 over the A300. As far as color and quality goes for A300 pictures, I've been very pleased. Well-exposed shots feature vivid color. The A300 color settings can be customized to your liking in the camera. All the pictures I've taken with sub-par color or exposure have usually been my fault, not the camera's.5. ERGONOMICS AND DETAILS. The A300 isn't too light nor too heavy. The Canons are very light and I feel like it's a bit harder to hold a steady shot when you don't have a solid camera in your hands. The menus are simple and straight-forward. The proprietary hot shoe may not work with Nikon and Canon flash systems, but it's mechanically sturdier (Sony took Minolta's great design) and is compatible with Minolta Maxxum 7000i and 5000i flashes, among others. The lens mount on the camera and the kit lenses are steel, which is way better than the plastic mounts that the entry level Canons and Nikons feature.6. ISSUES SO MINUSCULE THAT THEY DON'T BOTHER ME. Using the kit 18-70mm kit lens and the built-in flash will result in a slight shadow from 18mm up to approx. 25mm. I suggest either use an external flash, or zoom higher than 25mm. It's not a big problem at all. It's only at wide angles. As stated, The optical viewfinder is smaller than most, but fine for me. Support for the Alpha series isn't as good as Canons and Nikons in camera pro shops, and the customer service usually don't know a lot about these models.I got this camera for a steal of a deal. The camera kit with 18-70mm lens, and another 75-300mm Sony SAL75300 lens, a free Epson photo printer, a photography for dummies reference book, and some freebies from Snapfish all came out to $599 plus tax! It hasn't been 20 days since I've had my A300, and the picture count has already surpassed 1,300! It's such a pleasure to use that I hate putting it down. I can't wait for my next vacation so I can use this amazing piece of machinery! If you choose the A300, you will be very pleased and I guarantee you won't have buyers remorse!", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "A300K Review", "Author": "MRA \"MRA\"", "ReviewID": "R2XYWBYBHLAGJR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The A300 is, but for one flaw, an excellent camera. My pictures are consistently good. The controls are not bad. I would prefer more dials and less menus; however, the critical functions are readily accessible through the function button.The flaw I mentioned deals with the vulnerability of the (LCD) liquid crystal display. Because that display swivels, it stick out further from the camera body than would otherwise be the case. As such it is more likely to be damaged or scratched. Note that, unlike the Olympus E-510, the LCD does not swivel against the body for protection. Incredibly, Sony does not make available, at least for the US market, any attachable protective covers. The \"Lens and Accessory Compatibility Chart\" on Sony's US website does list a plastic sheet (part # PCK-lS3AM) as available for the A300 (and the A350). The \"Accessory\" catalog, at pages 9 and 18, lists the same part. Nevertheless, this part is not available in the US. This was confirmed to me by phone with Sony Customer Support and by letter dated May 8, 2008, from Sony Customer Affairs, that Sony Marketing has made the decision not to make this protective part available in the US. No reason was given. The part is available in Europe, but, not for shipment to the US.This is poor decision by Sony. Putting aside the question of listing the part as available when in fact it is not, the camera needs this part. Sony does make such protective devices available for the A200 and A700. The A300 and A350 need this protection more than the A200 and A700. The decision to deny American buyers the protection offered to Europeans is senseless.I am sure that the aftermarket will eventually remedy this oversight. Until then, unless you have a compelling need for live view and/or a swiveling LCD, stick with the A200.", "Date": "May 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "awesome camera", "Author": "D.

My two main reasons were: shutter lag and low-light performance.Having 2 Canon point-and-shoot digital cameras, I naturally got interested in the new Canon Digital Rebel XSi. An interesting features for someone like myself who is used to point-and-shoot cameras, is the Live View shooting mode which allows you to frame the picture using the screen instead of the viewfinder which is very similar to the way most of us use point-and-shoot digital cameras.When researching further I discovered that the way Canon implemented the Live View mode is not suitable for fast action photo taking, but more for tripod based accurate photographing.A couple of months I heard about the new Sony DSLR cameras.  I was surprised since I didn't know Sony manufactured DSLR cameras. I knew that the Sony brand is well known in audio and video equipment market but I wasn't familiar with the fact that they had professional DSLR cameras.After some reading I've discovered that Sony is indeed a newcomer to the DSLR market and that their entrance initiated in 2005 by jointly developing DSLR cameras with Konica-Minolta and eventually buying their entire DSLR business at 2006. Again, what caught my eye was the live-view feature that Sony implemented in a innovative way which does not hinder the camera's performance (especially the quick focus) when using it.Another feature that the new Sony cameras have (and Canon's don't) is in-body image stabilizer which works with every lens you attach. On the downside Sony's cameras do not perform as well as Canon's in high ISO settings and they have a much smaller variety of lenses available.Eventually, I've decided to buy the Sony and I don't regret it. Live view performs very well and the view finder is very good (although many reviews say that it is too small). I was also very fortunate to get 2 Minolta lenses from a relative so that was a very pleasant surprise and together with the in-body image stabilizer they produce wonderful photos.The camera is very agronomic and you can get to most settings with very few button clicks. High ISO setting noise starts to appear above ISO 400 but whether this is an issue depends on the size of prints you are going to produce. Other then that, the image quality is wonderful, of course this depends a lot on the type of lens you attach to it and there are very high quality old Minolta glass that matches this camera.", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Top notch camera", "Author": "aglowucannotsee \"aglowucannotsee\"", "ReviewID": "R6OY6ISS2GQE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for close to a year and still love it.

The Sony flash will actually work with the camera wirelessly so that even without being attached to the camera it will go off when you press the trigger.  Nice if you want to get lighting from some odd angle.Only real con to this camera is that it doesn't take video.  Would be a nice addition, and would make for less devices to carry.I did have the screen break on me.

I was able to return my out of the box camera, and ordered this newer model. I am glad I did, because of all the features that this camera has, as I will briefly describe below.It is a fantastic piece of equipment that allows amateurs, and mid level photographers to engage in their creative shooting, while using some of the advantages of a point and shoot camera.One of the main features that makes this camera so desirable is its 'live preview' feature on its LCD screen.I was used to shooting photos on a Sony Cyber before upgrading to a digital SLR. The few days I had the Alpha 200 I hated the fact that I had to look in the viewer. But with the Live preview function in this camera, I was satisfied of being able to shoot as I had already been shooting for about 3 years, and do it with much better results with this 10Mb pixel camera.I spent a couple months shooting with the automatic setting, which is just as using a point and shoot camera.The real power of this camera is unleashed when you start playing with the other shooting settings. I have already transitioned into only using this camera on its manual setting, and being able to create certain moods in the photographs I have shot, all by controlling exposure and aperture, the two technical elements that are required in photography.They are easily controlled and can be changed on the fly, while photographing your subject matter, by a simple button and a dial.A less known feature is the ability to take 3 shoots per second, with different exposure settings, using the EAB (Exposure Auto Bracketing) setting, very useful for those who want to combine 3 shots into one, using postprocessing with either Photoshop, or any other graphics program.The camera is compact, its weight is very manageable, and the life of the battery allows you to take as many photos as you want to create photographic essays on whatever subject you like.I definitely recommend this camera to anyone getting into the fantastic world of digital photography.

One of my more accomplished friends bought the Canon XSi at the same time while another of my friends swore by a Nikon. But after a few months, I have realized that for over 95% of our photos the Sony is just as good, if not better than the Canon or the Nikon, and about 20% cheaper. Also, the image stabilization is awesome and since the stabilizer is in the body, and not in the lens, each individual lens is way lighter. The sensor is as good as the Nikon one and maybe a hair less sensitive than the canon one in very low lights (noticeable at 1600 ISO or over). But, I have realized that a 1600 ISO picture is important low light conditions and mostly when all efforts to improve exposure fails, making it very rare. So it is not worth the 20% of price difference for me.The LCD is way better than the Canon XSi for sure, giving you a much better review of the picture.The menu is easy to handle and the controls are really good. However, the battery life is about as good as the canon, and not as good as the Nikon one. But a second battery easily solves that problem.By the way, it might take you 2-3 months to really become up to date with a good digital SLR if you have never used a dSLR before - till then, you shoud not pass a judgement on the camera.Overall I am glad that I bought the A300 and Love taking pictures with it.

Coming from a traditional film camera background, I find this camera very easy to use while supporting all the features that I need. Sony's liveview is the quickest you're likely to find, and the technology incorporated into the A300 is second to none, and the very useful in the body shake reduction (coupled with legacy minolta lens compatibility) make high quality lenses quite affordable when compared to other camera brands.With that being said, I am slightly disappointed with the image quality straight out of the camera. I find that with stock glass, images tend to be a bit soft, and need richness added in post processing. (This should be expected with a camera in this class though.) The average user who is likely to purchase a camera in this price range will probably not notice much of a difference between the Sony and its competition, and I've found the Sony to be a much better price. I am simply suggesting that the body outperforms the kit glass, and stepping up to a G series, or zeiss lens would really help with the lack of richness. (I'm probably being picky here. A person will likely never notice unless his images are printed over 13\".)This camera really shines when a person leaves the stock modes and sets picture style, and aperture to his liking. The lower ISO's perform beautifully, and I personally don't ever have a need to venture beyond an occasional ISO 800, so noise has never been an issue for my work.

Remington", "ReviewID": "RYF9M5JIQ0Z9U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There is really only one reason to choose this camera over the more established Nikon and Canon offerings and that is Live View. To put it simply, this is the ONLY DSLR with the ability to use the LCD screen to compose and take your picture with no sacrifice in focus speed vs. using the optical viewfinder. This is similar to how you use a point-and-shoot. Thus it is a great camera for those who prefer to take pictures using the LCD screen.Canon and Nikon both offer a form of live view that relies on contrast focus to take the picture which is slower and less accurate.I happen to love taking picture using the LCD screen in part because I wear a motorcycle helmet taking pictures which won't allow me to use the viewfinder on a traditional DSLR. Those who wear glasses or who like to shoot from the waist, ground, or overhead will also really appreciate this.If this feature is not important to you, you are better off getting the Canon or Nikon as they are a more mature platform with more support than Sony DSLRs.Keep in mind that the larger sensor on a DSLR allow a much better picture than any point-and-shoot. You will really notice this in low light/indoor shots where you can take pictures largely without flash which always looks so much better. You will also notice a much faster frames per second rate and much more flexibility in composing shots using custom settings.Those who simply want a point-and-shoot simplicity can set it on automatic and get great looking shots.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Greate Value Product", "Author": "Mr. Hetal Dinesh Patel \"Hetal Patel\"", "ReviewID": "R2PWCITRXXKPCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think for Taking Corner Shot, High or low Height shots the Live LCD is boon.Camera Battery rocks, Decent options for Lense from G, DT and Ziess Lense.Camera is very very affordable compared to same Feature in Nikon and Canon where we have to pay more then $ 500 for just Normal Lens with VR (Vibration Reduction) as it inbuild in Sensor.I think CMOS Sensor could have render image Better but Price Vs Value Ratio may go up then.", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Stellar for the price", "Author": "Joseph A.

During our 8-days in P.R. we shot over 1500 photos on beaches, rain forest, resorts, restaurants, driving down the road, etc.  The only accessories used were a standard UV filter and high speed 4GB CF card.Pros:- Exceptional Battery life.  Took close to 800 photos over three days before battery needed replacement.- Very intuitive menu.  My wife, who has never used a SLR or DSLR was able to take great photos with this camera (menu setup also makes it easy to teach)- Tilting live view screen.  Nice feature if you want to avoid bending down to take pictures of the kids or get some low angle shots.  Also nice to take pictures over obstacles (walls at El Morro fort)- Compatible with Playstation 3.  I just plugged the camera in to my PS3's USB port and was able to upload the photos into the PS3 hard drive... which brings me to the next point  -- Absolutely stunning photo quality!  After uploading the photos to my PS3, I viewed them full screen on my 65' Mitsubishi HDTV (1080p, connected via HDMI cable).  The results are stunning.  Clear, vibrant colors (all photos shot at 10mp.)  I can even zoom in another 50% and the photos still look good.  We're talking the equivalent of a 31x56 inch photo!- Great instruction manual.  I wasn't expecting the instruction manual to provide a crash course in photography, well done.Cons:- The flash is mounted low and creates a shadow when shooting on objects closer than a few feet- 10mp means really large files and slow transfer times.  But that should be expected...- LCD:  Doesn't sit flush with the back of the camera...  This would be a great improvement.I highly recommend this camera to those new to DSLR's.

At first I got caught up in all the specs of different models and the technical aspects of the descriptions.  The more I read the more I was inclined to purchase a high end camera and lens.  But, I kept saying to myself, \"Do you really have to spend $2,000-3,000 to get a good picture?\"  I kept looking at the sample pictures between cameras and decided not to spend 2x or 3x more for a picture that is a little better. In the end, I am glad that I purchased a Sony A300 with the kit and telephoto lens for $600.  I did purchase an additional lens, the Sony DT 18-200mm f3.5 zoom (used $250).  That is lens I use the most. I really like that lens and the results I get with it and the A300. For me it came down to value, liveview, and image stabilization within the camera itself.I have used the camera for two months and continue to learn its features.  Overall, I am happy with the results, the quality pictures. The mistakes I make in failing to get 'the shot' rest more with me than the camera. Some reviewers stated that good photographs depend more on the photographer than the equipment. I believe that statement.  So I'll keep my money in the bank, thank you.

This Sony has that, and more.  For example, image stabilization is in the body, not the lens.  This enables the stabilization feature with a wide variety of \"legacy\" lenses from Minolta, Vivitar, Sigma, Tamron, etc.Yet the Sony Alpha is *almost*, but not quite perfect, hence only four stars.  The Alpha has two shortcomings; it is not available without the kit lens which, although it covers an adequate range, it's largest aperture is still small; it requires a proprietary battery and I prefer the ability to run down to a local convenience store when my camera runs out of juice.
