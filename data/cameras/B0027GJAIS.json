The lens is all manual and has a lock screw for the focus. I like the CS lens and that is why I bought this camera to try out. I have several surveillance cameras and most have a board lens. I set this up under the eves of my building for a security camera and it works good in the daylight. It stays on-line reliably and I have never had to re-set it. The web user interface is different from most cameras in that you have to upgrade the firmware over the network by setting the camera up to download the firmware from a server rather than directly transferring it from a personal computer. The camera brightness control doesn't change much especially in low light situations. The camera barely picks up anything with my metal halide security light at night. I bought another fixed 4mm lens to try out but didn't notice much difference in sensitivity.I didn't try out the sd slot or the usb port so can't comment on the functionality. I did try power over ethernet but couldn't get that to work with my injector. It's a solid camera so I am not going to send it back since it mostly does what it is supposed to and most of this type of camera has some lack of functionality. I am building an airplane kit so I am going to use the camera to record the build inside. I think there will be enough light to get a good wide angle picture.The best camera for monitoring the property lit by metal halide security lights is my Trendnet TV-IP512P. I also have a 4mm f1.2 lens on it and the picture is bright even at night under the metal halides.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works as spected!", "Author": "Hector Rivera Falu", "ReviewID": "R2IH28ASE2R9DK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "But, I have a little issue with the camera.The camera, does not work well with Digital LED Screens used in Billboards.Maybe, I choosed wrong on this.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor support and flawed product", "Author": "WALTER RODRIGUES FILHO", "ReviewID": "RGR9MEYZZ3QG4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera never worked after firmware upgrade.
