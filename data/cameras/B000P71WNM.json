{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Useless manual and incorrect website", "Author": "V. Kathryn Daly", "ReviewID": "R152ATW6C7DGCB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY!!! I bought this at Wal-mart for the (seemingly) low price of $39.99. A camera that you can't function isn't a deal at any price. It wouldn't do the appropriate action even when I followed the manual verbatim. When I tried the website that's recommended in the manual, I was sent instead to a home page that didn't have any support for the model number ( 57490 ). They had lots of other models, but not this one. Apparently people have had trouble downloading pictures more than once, but I didn't even get that far. Luckily I was able to return it, but online purchases aren't as easy to remedy.", "Date": "April 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "The worst camera!", "Author": "J. Dobier", "ReviewID": "RBDMX6WQDUK0D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY!!!  Against my recommendation, my six-year old daughter bought this camera from Wal-Mart with her allowance.  The LCD screen is so horrible that you can barely tell what you just took a picture of.  There is no optical or digital zoom, so you have to move to get the picture, and I swear there is no focus or image stabilization on this camera, because when we downloaded them to the computer, all 50 or so pictures she took were blurry.  This is worse than my cell phone camera--probably the worst camera you can buy.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$ - It's a piece of JUNK!", "Author": "M. C. Hernandez \"Coffee Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R12Y9XWLSP0VO9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy this camera! It is a piece of complete and utterly worthless JUNK.  I bought it for my 7-year old for Christmas. The quality of the pictures it takes (that is, when it is actually working correctly, which was RARE!) is simply awful! The pictures are so horribly grainy that you cannot even discern who is in the image. It seemed like a great deal and a good price for an inexpensive camera for a kid - but when you see how awful the pictures are, you will realize you've been totally ripped off if you have purchased this!It's really such a terrible product, I don't even know how they get by selling it at all.  I wanted to give it NO STARS but the system does not allow that, I guess.  The 1 star I am giving it is far too generous!", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Only 2 pictures!!!", "Author": "katie Winkelmann", "ReviewID": "RFJYE2TWLUL8J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product was not what I anticipated it to be. I knew getting in to it that the screen would be small, but the picture quality is poor and it only allows you to take 2 pictures before your memory is full. There might be a way to change the resolution to allow for more picutres, but the menu is very confusing and I cannot figure it out. I consider myself to be somewhat tech-savvy. I can usually figure out most cameras and phones, but this one just does not make sense. The other thing that really upset me was that you cannot delete just one photo. I can delete ALL of the photos, but not one specific one. I purchased this camera for my neice and nephew as a digital camera that they can use and not worry  too much about breaking, but they don't even enjoy it because they can only take two pictures and then have to upload them or delete them to take any extra. It says you can buy a memory card, but the selling point for the camera was the price, and that would just be one more thing to purchase. For me, it is not worth the money AT ALL!", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy", "Author": "Mr Matt", "ReviewID": "R2UAU9BM4JEOZ9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the third of these \"Sakar\" cameras gifted to my kids.  They are all junk!  Pictures are extra poor, usability is not good, and battery life is bad.  It shouldn't be called a camera and can barely be classified as a \"toy\".  This company should be ashamed of such poor product development.Do not waste your money.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pure crap", "Author": "Angie", "ReviewID": "R2Q8PNSRW7SFKG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is a complete waste of money.

I purchased this a short time ago (not from Amazon, otherwise I could have used these helpful reviews) and I'm so sorry I did. The pictures are fuzzy, the manual is worthless, with precious little information. Forget about the video function - that's even fuzzier and grainier than the \"photos\" you'll take with this deplorable waste of plastic. This is a pathetic camera at any price. Digital Concepts should be ashamed to have a product like this on the market.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "BAd Buy", "Author": "Travivra Allaway", "ReviewID": "R27WSXV2PB27OM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Its basically a mini camera you can get for less at walmart,not to mention how blurry and distorted the photo's turn out.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000P71WNM"}}
