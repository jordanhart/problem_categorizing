{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great surveillance system.", "Author": "S. Schwalem", "ReviewID": "R14CKG2KZEHWRT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a cost effective surveillance system, then I would suggest purchasing this model, or one similar to it with CCD cameras as they are recommended for nighttime use.It took me about 4 hours to install this, partly because I had to run the cables through the attic, but once it was operational it worked most flawlessly.  The DVR automatically boots itself, and then you can start programming it to your own personal settings.  I did have to order a new cable because I accidently ripped the video feed end off on one as I was pulling it through the attic.  So be careful not to yank on it too hard.Setup wasn't bad, but the manual isn't very clear on how to set it to record only when motion is detected.  After fooling around with it for about 30 minutes I finally discovered that you need to select schedule, and then you must highlight every hour of the first day, then copy that to all the other days on the list.  The whole list must be in red, otherwise it just tells you that there was motion detected, but it won't record.Overall video quality is very good during daylight.  It's not HD, but you can still make out the facial features of any subject that it records.  Low light operation is ok, but it's probably only effective to about 30-40 feet.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.99", "Features": "Record & view 4 channels of high quality video simultaneously in real time\nIncludes 4 all-weather, high resolution 480TVL cameras with powerful night vision to 65ft / 20m\nSet & forget by recording continuously from 4 cameras for 120 days+ onto a massive 500GB hard drive, longer with motion detection\nSave time & have peace of mind by easily locating incident video, then trim & transfer to USB flash drive\nSurveillance in the palm of your hand with live viewing on 3G enabled Smartphones including iPhone, iPad, Blackberry, Android, Windows Mobile 6, Symbian and more", "Name": "Swann SWDVK-426004-US 4-Channel Digital Video Recorder with Smartphone Viewing and 4x CCD Cameras (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/214Kpmv2aRL.jpg", "ProductID": "B004SYOOEC"}}
