My old Canon S3 was out performing the SX40 in macro.  So I took it back to Best Buy, and found a real camera buff working there, and he told me I bought the wrong 8 GB SDHC card a class 4 (4 mb per second transfer rate) which caused the camera to blur, so I purchased a class 10 (20 mb per second) for $10 bucks more, now I love my camera!!!", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Big step up from the SX30IS", "Author": "Adam Petrone \"Adam\"", "ReviewID": "R92P45DTBCZEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had the SX40HS for 1 day , but in comparing the photo's from the SX30is I own to the SX40hs the quality of the photo's are much sharper with true to life colors, the biggest improvement I see is in low light. The low light photo's are sharp and bright but with that natural lighting look.I purchased the SX30IS last fall and was generally happy with it. When I heard that the SX40HS was to have the new Digic 5 processor I jumped at it. I love the fact that it's an all in 1 camera, HD Video, zoom and wide angle photo's. The SX40HS  has the new Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor and a high-sensitivity 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor dropped down from 14 Megapixel in the SX30IS. This advanced Canon technology delivers stunning image quality with reduced noise and blur and for the first time in the super zoom  it brings high-speed burst shooting and 1080p video to the party, even though the video looks super it's only at 24fps, why not 30 fps is beyond me. As I play more I'll add to this post. My SX30IS is up on E-Bay as I type this.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Zoom. Zoom.", "Author": "D.

I've been looking to upgrade from our original point and shoot to something a little more robust.  You know, those dang slim models just didn't seem to have the oomph to produce high quality indoor pictures from any distance other than about 10 feet.Enter the Canon Powershot SX40 HS.  This is your all in one camera.  No where will you find a camera short of a full on DSLR that can go 35x optical.  I've seen 24, but not 35x.  How sweet is being able to zoom in at 35x?  Watch my video to see.  Did you hear the lens zooming in during the video?  Nope.  It is whisper quiet.The battery took just over 1.5 hours to charge and we were off to a Homecoming football game on rather cool, crisp night (45-50 degrees). I was worried, because my other point shoot really seemed to be bothered by the cold weather and would not zoom well and started to lose battery life.  The Canon performed beautifully after nearly 100 shots and upwards of 10 minutes of video.  I came back home, downloaded the pictures and the camera is still reported 100% battery level.There are many, many options that I can't even begin to discuss, much less have tried yet.  All I can tell you is if you want an upgrade and don't want to go full on DSLR for $600 basic model upwards to $2000, you should not hesitate to purchase this camera.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great zoom range, nice image quality, designed for dummies", "Author": "A. Rose", "ReviewID": "RY0SGSYLCRNHE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a month ago and I've passed the 2000 picture mark, so I guess I'll jump in and provide a review. I upgraded from the Canon PowerShot SX10 IS to this one and I've been thrilled with some of the new features and less than thrilled with others.The quick verdict:This is a great camera for anyone who wants lots of features and versatility but doesn't want to use manual settings and doesn't travel a lot.Pros: great zoom range, nice picture and video quality, improved low light performanceCons: ISO locked to 100 with >1 second exposures, proprietary Li-ion batteryHandling:The camera is a bit bulky, as you would expect from a camera with a 35x zoom lens, but I quickly got the hang of handling it. I tend to accidentally hit the zoom framing assist button when shooting. It seems to be right where my thumb wants to be when holding the camera, especially when switching between landscape and portrait orientation. I had similar issues with the SX10. I'm not sure I like the memory card being slotted in with the battery on the bottom of the camera. Access to the battery/card slot is blocked when attaching the camera to a tripod quick release plate.Zoom capabilities:The zoom range is a nice feature. The size of the full moon is about 1/5th along the long side of the image at full optical zoom and close to 850 pixels across. On a clear night, you can get some nice detail. Clipping the Raynox DCR-250 macro conversion lens on at full zoom and using a light box for trans-illumination, I was also able to take pictures of microscope slides at 125x total magnification on a 150 dpi test print. They look better than the images I took with a scope and CCD camera at the lab. Very nice!Image quality and low light performance:The image quality under low light and high ISO conditions has improved compared to the SX10. I took some images of kittens at the shelter in rooms that were poorly lit. With the SX10, I would end up with a lot of motion blur and noise on high ISO (800) images. Comparable images look better with the SX40, but some processing artifacts are visible when looking at the full size of the high ISO (1600) images. The camera ultimately was not able to stop the motion of kittens at play without the use of flash though, but I was expecting that under the poor light conditions.External flash:Speaking of flash, the camera works well with the SpeedLite 270EX flash. The hot shoe can be covered with a plastic cap for protection when not in use. It took me a few tries to figure out the best way to take the cap off, but with a closer look at the design once you get it off it becomes obvious. Having long enough fingernails to get under and lift the front of the cap makes it easier.Filters and lens accessories:The lens can be fitted with the same 58 mm Lensmate filter adapter as the SX10. Thin filters will work fine at all zoom settings, but thicker filters like a circular polarizer or stacking several filters will cause vignetting at wide angle. A little bit of zoom or a 67 mm filter adapter may help avoid the vignetting issue. The lens cap that comes with the camera will no longer fit once you put the filter adapter on. And speaking of the lens cap - Canon put a tether on it, so it can be attached to the camera thus reducing the risk of losing it compared to the non-tethered cap of the SX10. While that is a plus, the SX40 does not come with a lens hood like the SX10 did. That would need to be purchased separately.Settings:One thing I miss on the SX40 is the \"sunset\" preset under the SCN options that the SX10 offered. Out of all the SCN options on the SX10, that one probably saw the most use when I wasn't in M or Av mode, so I'll have to figure out an equivalent setting on the SX40. The snow, beach, and foliage settings are all still there, so why did the sunset disappear? The new settings such as miniature seem intriguing, but I haven't really gotten into exploring that yet.Overall, the camera has a lot of good features. So why would I give it only three stars? There are at least two things that I would consider design flaws.Battery:Let's start with the battery. This is a so-so issue, some good news and some bad news. The good news is the battery weighs less than the SX10's AA batteries, lasts longer (for about 1000 pictures), and fully recharges in under 2 hours while I often have to let the AAs recharge over night. The bad news is it is much more expensive to get a spare and inconvenient for travel. With the SX10, I could fly overseas and use my mom's batteries and charger in Germany in case I forgot to bring mine. If needed, I could rely on AA batteries being available at a souvenir shop or gas station. With the proprietary battery pack, if I forget to take the charger and 220V adapter with me or don't have anywhere to plug it in, the camera is dead once its battery pack runs out of power. You can't just buy a spare one at a gas station. If you have a spare battery pack in your possession, you have to package it according to TSA safety restrictions on Lithium batteries if you take it on an airplane. So there's a lot more to consider when traveling with this camera. If Canon offered the same camera with the option of using AA batteries, I would probably opt for that instead of the battery pack just for the sake of convenience when traveling.\"Manual\" mode limitations:The bigger issue though is that the camera does not have a fully manual mode. Sure, there is the M mode setting, but it has limitations. I noticed it when I took some night shots and the camera changed my ISO setting from 400 to 100 as I increased exposure time in M mode. When I tried to reset the ISO, it told me \"ISO speed is limited due to slow shutter speed.\" The camera manual explains under Tv mode that when shutter speeds of 1.3 seconds or slower are used, the ISO speed is fixed to ISO 100. However, there is no warning about it on the page detailing M mode and I did not expect to find any limits in manual setting as it wouldn't really be manual then.I emailed Canon support about it and they clearly did not get what I was asking about, so I called phone support. The guy I talked to was clearly not expecting this limitation either and at first told me I probably had a faulty camera and should send it in. However, he was then able to reproduce the effect on his camera much to his own surprise. He had to check with someone and finally came back with the information that the limitation is built into the firmware by design to \"prevent overexposure and hot pixels on the sensor.\" No plans to upgrade the firmware to change that. He recommended cranking up the ISO to 3200 at 1 second exposure. That's not really what I wanted to do though. It's a bit of a joke really, or even insulting, to any photographer who knows what they're doing in M mode.It is possible to get around this limitation using a CHDK hack. However, at this time there is only a buggy alpha version of CHDK available for the SX40. I gave it a try and while the ISO override worked, it wasn't the ISO I had set it for. E.g. setting the override at ISO 400 gave me pictures with ISO 640, and setting it for ISO 800 gave me ISO 1250. Regardless of the option of using CHDK, this limitation is like putting a child lock on M mode and it's a farce to call the resulting feature \"manual mode.\" So that is my main disappointment with this camera so far.Instructions:Last but not least, I was also disappointed that Canon does not provide a printed manual with the camera. All you get is a PDF on the accompanying CD. It is set to print in postcard size, which results in a lot of white space and waste of paper when printing it. The resulting binder weighs more than a pound in paper weight. Neither the PDF nor the print out are useful as a reference in the field, at least not for me. The tech support person I talked to quickly promised to get a printed manual sent to me at no charge when I mentioned it though, so a phone call might be all it takes to get one. I haven't received it yet, but when I do I shall report what it looks like.The verdict:Overall, the SX40 is a nice camera with some great features, but unfortunately it is prevented from performing to its full potential by restrictions that Canon designed into the firmware. Canon's \"design\" of locking ISO settings in manual mode is almost an insult to more advanced hobby photographers, and it is clearly misleading to still call it \"manual\" if the camera is allowed to override the photographer's choices in settings. I don't think any other camera model in this quality and price class does that. However, those who do not use M mode routinely will probably hardly notice this limitation.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny!!!", "Author": "CrazyMom", "ReviewID": "R3NO9OI7VHWUHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few weeks ago, it is an early Christmas present from my husband!!  After I read up on the reviews by professionals (which I find sometimes biased) I tried to find some USER reviews which are the reviews I always base my decision buying on, but could only find 2 on amazon.  I decided to buy it because I knew I could always return it.  Well, let's just say I have not been able to put it down!  I currently own a Canon Rebel which is 6 years old and have never been totally happy with it, especially sport shots which are very tricky especially indoors and low light.  This camera far exceeds any camera I have ever owned and I have owned Sony, Olympus & Canon.  BUY IT!  You will not regret it.  I see the price has dropped since I purchased it 2 weeks ago as I paid $429.99 but even at that price it is worth every penny.  Sports shots have come out fantastic and I even took a picture of the moon with the 35x optical zoom withOUT a tripod, it came out magnificent!!!!  Super clear !  The video is nice too and I love being able to video and then take a picture while videoing!  Landscape shots are fantastic just play with all the modes to see which works best for you and oh let me tell you about the VIVID color!  Yes it makes all your pictures have just a little bit extra color and what a difference it makes!!!  I could go on and on but take my advice, BUY IT you won't regret it!!!", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good. Not Perfect, But What Is? (Have Moved to the SX50)", "Author": "Ethan Winning \"Ethan Winning\"", "ReviewID": "R3ON161R7VLMVD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "March 1, 2014 - It took six months of research before making the decision, but I did move up to the SX50. Other than the longer zoom which was a minor consideration, the SX50 had very little shutter lag, does much better in low light, focuses much more quickly, and has a spot focus where the SX50 focuses on a bird, for example, rather than trying to focus on the twigs and leaves in a tree. See my review of the SX50. (I had to buy two now that I got my wife involved in nature photography. Let's hope there's no SX60...)****Sept. 1, 2012 - Although I'm always leery that Canon will come out with a new model soon after I order a camera, I have just placed an order for an SX40HS for my wife! Some of you may think that it must be worth 5 stars now, and the answer is that it is not perfect. Shutter lag and spot focusing continue to be problematic. Low light even using a higher ISO is still an issue, but the lens and IS at 35x are superb. Many of the photos that I have posted with this review have recently won photo contests, and that is certainly due to the equipment almost as much as my knowing how to use it.****May 23, 2012 - I have now taken over 30,000 photos with this camera, and probably would have taken 50,000 except that I didn't start using the burst mode until 6 weeks ago. Once in a while, I do have the \"universal\" digital problem of the camera not \"wanting\" to focus on the object, especially when the subject is a bird in front of a grassy field or worse, a bird IN a mustard field, but I've learned a secret to correct this.A bigger pain in the neck is that this camera is still not terrific in low light, and \"low light\" can be defined as a cloudy day rather than just indoors. The difference between sunny and cloudy can be 1/2500 of a second to 1/50th of a second. Canon disagrees, but I notice that they and all manufacturers still have cameras without the extreme zoom that are advertised to be perfect in low light.The camera still gets 4.5 stars, and that's where it will stay. Would I buy it again? In a heartbeat, but now I really know this camera.****Nov. 3, 2011 and Jan. 13, 2012 - [Please see posted photos here and web site from my first days' and most recent shootings. A picture is worth a thousand words.] I will do a complete review as the weather clears and I can take some photos in various light conditions. So far, it has performed well enough, but there is a learning curve from the SX20 which allowed greater latitude in overriding what the camera \"wants to do.\"It may take a month before I can review the camera adequately, so I have uploaded some photos that I took on the first day, and I must say that they're pretty good. However, there were only 8 out of 51 taken. ...And then it started to rain. Please note that I am not new to the Canon line or (nature) photography: I have had the A620, S3, S5, SX10, SX20, and now the SX40. (I returned the SX30 which was a terrible disappointment.) And I've been taking pictures for over 60 years. So, unless you really get to know the camera - and even then - you may or may not get the results that I do.On that note, I might add that I was sorely disappointed that Canon didn't pop for a printed manual which, with this camera, is a must. Unlike the SX20 for which I could use the SX10 manual, this camera is quite different and - so far - I think more complex or at least more different than the SX20. Because of the issues that I've run into just in 3 days, it's very difficult to cross-reference what it says under Av with Tv or C1. This is not the basic point-and-shoot Elph, and I rarely shoot in \"Auto.\" As I said, I have to give it a couple of weeks before I'll pass judgment.I must say that the photos that WERE already posted when I bought the camera gave me some trepidation in that so many were a little washed out. What I am finding so far is that, \"Auto\" might well be \"Average.\" Average aperture, Average speed, Average contrast. But I purchased it anyway, and I've already found that Av or Tv or M are still the best settings although, unlike the SX20 where one could just set the speed and the camera would use the setting, I had to save the Tv settings to C1 or C2. This became routine by my third day (today).Nov. 8, 2011:Five days since I got the camera, and three days of shooting. I must say I've never seen so many comments regarding reviews, and many people have agreed with the more negative comments. What I've found is that the quality of photos I've taken have been excellent, needing very little post-production diddling. That said, and having used the burst mode, I'm deleting 4/5ths of the pix that I've taken, some because of duplication, some because of focus, and some because I just screwed up.In looking at the negative comments, I would admonish people to decide before buying this camera - or any other camera - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO USE THE CAMERA FOR??? I take pictures of nature, some scenery, but mostly birds, bugs, bunnies, bees, bears, and begonias. The SX40 HS has done very well in these areas, and I realize that there is a learning curve for such extreme focal lengths and the macro (which I rarely use).If you're going to take night time shots - which seems to have garnered so much comment about viewfinders and such - I can't address it. I took a picture of the (harvest) moon, hand-held, in Tv mode and it came out beautifully. But I don't take many nighttime pix, and I haven't had a chance to take fireworks in years. (If I want snapshots of people or parties, I use my wife's Elph.)I am still having some difficulty in overriding what the camera is set for re: aperture and speed. The SX20 could be overridden just by setting the speed to 1/2500th and one would get a much darker picture which could then be adjusted with software. Sometimes, it's the only way to get realistic clouds. With the SX40, I set it for 1/2500 and when I shoot, the camera comes down to 1/1600 or slower. IF I ever get the printed manual that Canon promised, I'll look for the menu where I can increase the value of the photo by -3 to +3. Yeah, I'm being a little lazy, but I hate the .pdf manual on disc that came with the camera.On the plus side, by coming down to 12 mp from 14 and by improving the processor, I can finally get SOME pix in low light or at least on a cloudy day. I've posted a few photos from the past few days: the two of the golden-crowned sparrows and the hummer were taken in low light and in thickets. They came out as sharp as anything I've ever taken with the SX10 or 20 (or S3 or S5 etc. etc.). Another plus, I am not having as much trouble with the SX40 focusing on a bird in the middle of a tree. The camera spots the center and at least HALF the time immediately seems to understand I want the bird not the branches.IF every photo I took came out perfectly, where's the fun in photography? Yes, sometimes the SX40 frustrates me, but Mother Nature sometimes frustrates me. Sometimes I think Mother Nature is picking on me. I ALWAYS though that Canon picked on everybody. After all, why do they come out with an improvement (?) every 10-12 months? Okay, the SX30 was terrible...I'll continue this in another week or so. For the time being, what I really like is the sharp photos I've been getting, and the 8 fps in the burst mode (the third is usually the best). I'm still not crazy about is the lack of an override for Tv and Av even using the C1, and I THINK the viewfinder is smaller than the SX20.Oh, btw, this camera is a few crucial (after a 5 hour hike) ounces less than the SX20. It's probably because it has a proprietary battery instead of the 4 AAs. I like the weight. What I don't like is that Canon wants $59 for a second battery, and has warned me about buying from \"the secondary market.\" Comments? Suggestions? I'd appreciate knowing if there's a reliable battery that will work with this camera. (One of the other dealers offering a second battery as part of the SX40 HS package has been called out for offering a battery that doesn't fit the SX40!)I think it's silly to say that the LCD isn't as clear as a computer monitor. Never had one that was, and I'm often disappointed when something that looks in focus on the LCD is not nearly as sharp on my computer. After 12 years of digital photography, I've become accustomed to it. At least I didn't waste any film and have to wait two weeks to find out that my vacation pix are lousy.Still 4 stars for the features, 5 for the photos I've taken, and 3.5 for Canon engineers.Nov. 14, 2011.I posted more photos which speak for themselves. However, there is a caveat: I took 191 photos this morning mostly of deer, wild turkey, hawks, one praying mantis, and one tarantula. Of the 191, I posted (on my own site) 9. Here, I posted 5. And I kept 11. 180 were deleted, and that brings up two points. The burst mode of 8 fps works. That is, the SX40 really can shoot at 8 frames per second. However, not all will be in focus; many will be identical shots; and it is not the panacea for carefully composing and focusing and being at the right setting. (If you need the burst mode, you may be best off in Tv because speed is what you're after.)And please note: The battery is rated at being able to take 400 photos at the highest resolution and using the viewfinder (380 using the LCD). Well, if you shoot in the burst mode often or you take \"movies,\" expect your battery to go in about 250 shots - and that's fast at 8 fps. I have just purchased two more batteries and, though they're not Canon \"approved\" because they're 1/4th the price, I'm hoping that I now will never run out of batteries while shooting. Will report on that when I get them.Just one note re: the battery indicator. When the battery indicator is down from 3 (full) to 2 bars, it only takes 3-5 more photos to get it to show red and Charge the Battery. This isn't a lot more helpful than the old SX20 which allowed about 10 shots when it said to change the battery without any precursor. I was really looking forward to having a real battery indicator. This ain't it. Still 4.5 stars.Nov. 22, 2011I started this review on Nov. 3 by saying, \"So far so good,\" but I had a few reservations. I no longer have reservations, and would definitely recommend the SX40 to anyone who is more than a novice photographer. This is not a \"simple\" point and shoot, and you may get more than what you need or even want.It takes great photos, but you still have to know how to tweak its capabilities. If you're just going to keep this at \"Auto,\" then you don't need this camera. However, if you really want such features as taking movies and using \"my colors\" and a quasi-fisheye mode, this may very well be the camera for you. If you want to take pictures in RAW, this is not the camera for you (it doesn't have RAW). I care about none of these things, so for me the camera gets 4.5 stars. If you want those features, this camera may be only a 3 or 4.So basically, I'm content with my purchase. There's no second-guessing. No alternative would have made me happier. I REALLY like it, but I don't love it. BUT look at it this way: if I got perfect pictures every time, it would take all the fun out of digital photography. I still need room for creativity ... and improvement.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Las Vegas Stratosphere, so close, you can throw a rock through the window", "Author": "Joe Jr.",

I've tested it with landscape, wild life, fast moving objects, and portraits. It has not failed me yet!Camera - Has many fuctions that come with just about all digital cameras, but also has some really fun ones that you wouldn't expect. For example, the fish eye effect is a lot of fun and makes people and pets look like caricatures. The smart-auto really works great and selects the perfect setting for what you are shooting. Nice, crisp, clear, and vibrant pics every time. The zoom is spectacular! It will pick up every little detail, like you are right in front of it.Video - Remember, it's a camrea first. However, the HD footage is pretty good, lags a little, but the color is great and the 1080p video is clear. Picks up a lot of backround noise and you can clearly hear the zoom going in and out. Don't expect the same video quality you would get from a real HD camcorder.Body - Doesn't feel like a regular point and shoot digital camera. Has more of a SLR feel to it. Solid, sturdy, and just a tad bit on the heavy side but not to bad. Great design to the LCD screen that you can flip over so that you don't scrath it. I really like the view-finder and the one-touch video record button.Overall - I highly recommend this camera. It's A LOT of fun, takes wonderful pictures, and is very easy to use. Make sure that you get a class 10 SD card for it, anything less could cause a blur when using some of the fuctions and the zoom. The perfect alternative to an SLR, without paying over $1000.00 for it.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Joshua \"mxjoshua\"", "ReviewID": "R31ILY5IUOT8YJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off let me state that I never write reviews, but I'm so happy my doorman had this waiting for me yesterday evening. After getting acquainted with my new camera a bit, I have to say it's truly a big step up from the sx30 (which I also own). The camera seems more responsive overall. The auto definitely works better. Pictures are crystal clear. And low light pictures are simply amazing. I even tested ISO 3200 with a nightlight and it produced a usable image with very little noise. Also, since the camera is more responsive to low light the zoom seems to work much better because low light zoom pics are very clear and have negligible noise.. This camera is simply a wonderful value for the money.

Ifound it really great.Users from beginners up to experienced photographers will enjoy that camera.Beginners will get excellent pictures using the \"automatic\" mode, while experienced users will have plenty of parameters to play with, to really obtain desired image effects.Beginers will get ample possibilities to start perfecting their photography taking skills. Experienced users will have a light versatile camera that can be taken at all times without having to carry the heavy load of a DSLR camera and its lenses in a cumbersome bag...That's exactly why I bought this Canon SX40HS: when going out on casual walks in town or by the sea side, I wanted to go out with a lighter equipment than my photographic bag containing my DSLR camera and at least three zoom lenses. Reserving the whole DSLR kit for dedicated photographic expeditions...So far , using the SX40HS to test in the most difficult conditions,I've had only good results... Obtaining unexpected high quality pictures in the worst light conditions. I have posted some of the pictures on various photographic forums in regular \"forum\" picture size as well as 100% crop tests. Very advanced photo experts have been impressed by these images quality after a 100% picture crop...Some are available on a specific facebook album I created for the purpose of sharing this rather early image test in regular use conditions.[...]Video amateurs will be glad to learn that the digital zoom functions very well, enabling seemless zooming on a moving subject from 24mm focal length up to 840mm optical zoom and further to 4X numeric zoom. I tested that on photographic pictures and they are astonishigly good... In video they would be even better as, video runing at 24 images/second, lets the eyes compensate for minute imperfections...I was already very happy with the previous Canon Bridge SX10IS, but here this new Canon Bridge image quality and feature availability is really superb.Note that I will use it as very longtelephoto lens when going out with my DSLR camera for which I only have a 16_105 zoom lens and a 70-300mm zoom lens, not enough for some shootings...Paul", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Magnum Camera without the dSLR price", "Author": "wvhunter1968", "ReviewID": "R2ZJI5QLF6DMFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife recently asked me about getting a camera for around the house and wanted to upgrade from our old point and shoot. Being an amateur photo enthusiast for as long as I have been and hanging with some real camera nuts I can honestly say I never hesitated. The Canon SX40 HS is the answer for many who want to get more serious, but maybe the bulk or price of a true dSLR doesn't fit your needs. In many (and most cases) this camera not only fills the gap, it will leave you not even wanting a true dSLR. This coming from a man that owns a Nikon D7000 with 3 detachable lenses and hundreds of dollars in accessories. I also own a Canon SX20is which is 2 years old as of this writing, but a camera that I still grab if I want to not worry to much about technical shooting and want to worry more about composition and maybe add some artistic flare with it's many cool functions.No, the Canon is not a detachable lens dSLR.  It is a full body \"bridge camera\" that does more in many instances of what a dSLR camera can do for the average person but maybe a bit less than what a professional would want done to their pics.  Of course a professional would need thousands of dollars in lenses and a photoshop program to match some of the functions this camera can do.  This camera is top in it's class amongst bridge style camera's in picture quality and shooting side by side with the Nikon Cool PIx direct competition proved what I had thought all along. (Again this coming from a Nikon d7000 owner). Canon plain and simple owns the high end bridge camera market in my opinion.Zoom is a big seller and many are disappointed when they hit the dSLR market and see the price of even a modest Zoom lens. Considering a low end 200mm lens for a dSLR is about the price of this entire camera, I can see why some skip the dSLR market altogether and would want something like this.  The average person would never be able to afford the zoom this camera offers on a dSLR.Quality usually goes down when zoom is involved as well. Ask any camera buff to test this baby out.  They will be amazed. Im not saying it's the equivalent of a f2.8 200mm or 500mm lens professionals use, but it's not bad and this entire camera weighs less than most 300mm dSLR lenses do and a 10th of what a 500mm lens would.  The detractors of my comparison, I'm sure, will mutter some mumbo jumbo about how the f-stop is too high on these super zoom cameras and that there is no way they can get as much quality as their $5000-$10000 outfit.  It may be so when comparing many technical aspects, but what I like is flat out results, not what some technical guru is telling you. And I LOVE the results of the testing I've put this camera through.  For the money, for the weight of this unit and all else, I will stand behind my claim thatThis camera has a 35X optical zoom (WITH an incredible 140X digital zoom) that produces images better than I could ever have imagined (even compared to my 80x zoom on my sx20...so big improvements in technology there!). It has an optical stabilization of which I am totally impressed with considering you can freehand a zoomed in pic at 140 digital zoom (35x optical) and get impressive pics. The zoom doesn't seem to suffer from lack of resolution or light gathering capabilities either in daylight hours.. On one particular extremely overcast day my wife took a picture of the trans-allegheny lunatic asylum in Weston, WV clock tower from the fence at the street and it filling the frame completely (and then some) with no motion and beautiful resolution. Considering at full zoom the 35mm equivilant is 840mm (can you imagine the price of THAT lens for a dSLR) I found this impressive. You could see the paint peeling off the clock face she got so close! We were a good 300 yards from it.Size is manageable as well. Smaller than any dSLR. It's not slim like a pocket camera, but it isn't bulky like a dSLR either. Its a \"best of both worlds hybrid camera\" that any camera enthusiast would be proud to have in their arsenal. In addition the video on this camera rivals any consumer HD camera available. I use my sx20 for my youtube videos and consistently get complimented on image quality. The sx40 has now further 'upped the ante' (from my sx20) and bumped up quality to a full 1080HD video WITH autofocus (which even the best dSLR cameras cannot rival to this date). Considering video cameras have typically low res photo taking quality, it would make sense to buy this as your video camera AND you get awesome 12MP picture quality in addition.OK, so thus far you may think I have elevated this to God status. I realize it's faults. I know it's shortcomings. Thus the reason I own my Nikon d7000.A true dSLR has advantages. Manually focusing pictures is so much easier(I wouldn't even bother with manual focus with this camera), lower f-stops (with the correct lens, which btw are very expensive), wide angle shots (again, expensive lense) and the ability to crank out 3200ISO pictures with decent quality are the 3 that come to mind immediatly. The art of pulling together a beautiful picture that you can truly call your own, with a combination of technical expertise and composing can be more fully realized with a dSLR detachable lens type camera. But for the average person looking at your pictures and seeing the end result, most all but the most arogant camera snobs would say \"who cares\" [lol]. Again, this coming from a man that owns an amazing Nikon dSLR.For the amateur enthusiast who wants to 'up their game' (without the expense of a magnum camera), dabble with manual settings and experiment with various picture options like fish eye lens, color swapping/enhancing, super-vivid color saturation option in addition to having the capability to get high quality video all within one carry around camera (without the bag) and so much more...I will HIGHLY recommend this camera to anybody that is looking for a camera but not quite wanting to reach into the expensive dSLR market.Highly recommended accessory ($10 in a few stores here on Amazon) would be the conversion ring that allows the use of 58mm filters so that you can dabble with polarizing and ND filters to further enhance your photography.  This camera does not allow the use of standard dSLR camera filters, you need this conversion ring to allow filters to be screwed on properly.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera--Canon finally got it right!", "Author": "caaron", "ReviewID": "R1W9BUYPEECFGV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had both of the predecessors to this camera--the SX20 IS and the SX 30IS.  The new processor in this camera really works where those were 'iffy'.  Stabilization is excellent even at 840mm (equivalent) and the pictures are crystal clear with minimal chromatic aberration and fringing (means they are sharp and relatively undistorted).  The burst mode is fantastic--you can shoot up to 8 frames at 10 frames per second with this camera and it really works the way it is supposed to.  It even uses the programmed settings and will do exposure bracketing in burst mode.  My only complaint is that the zoom framing assist button (which is the same as the one on the SX30 IS) is placed where your thumb would normally be so it is difficult to shoot without inadvertently pressing it, which is why I didn't give it a 5 star rating.  The zoom framing assist button itself is very helpful because it is difficult at full zoom to find a fast moving bird in the frame so it allows  you to back the zoom off temporarily until you can re-acquire the image and then zoom in to shoot it.  Picture quality is excellent with the new Digic 5 image processor, often rivaling the quality of pictures I've taken with my DSLR.  This is a great all-around camera that although it is not pocketable is small enough and light enough to take anywhere.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Camera I've Been Waiting For....", "Author": "Elisa 20", "ReviewID": "RKYRA8QYJ3EKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've held off buying a digital camera, getting by with a simple point and shoot and a cell phone. The last time I took a serious look at digital cameras, there were two main kinds--point and shoots and DSLR. The point and shoot was \"okay\" for snapshots. The DSLR was the one you'd get for image quality and control over all the elements of photography (thinking back to film camera days.../old).The point and shoots were functional, pocketable and simple. The DSLRs were sophisticated, complicated and heavy (lenses...you would want to have lenses....)  Oh, and DSLRs were really pricey, especially getting the lenses (the kits? Not such a good idea). I bought a point and shoot and always felt ...\"eh...\" about it. Not very exciting if you want to pursue photography as a hobby (as I used to do with my old 35mm Canon A-1, which I loved).So, imagine my surprise looking around here a month ago and finding there has been a sea change in the digital camera world. Not only have the prices gone down for everything--what an array of choices there are now in all categories!--but the technology, the capabilities of even so-called point and shoot cameras is now pretty amazing. And you get so much \"still camera\" PLUS video, too.So...I narrowed down my choices and tried to decide: \"Canon T3i...or Canon s100?\" Two different concepts, both very versatile, but one easy to slip in a pocket or purse, the other...feeling more like what I still think of as a \"real\" camera--interchangeable lenses, hot shoe for the flash, RAW, and...with video..a nice capability to have an external mike.While I was thinking, I went over to [...] (Canon Talk) forum where they were discussing the same thing: What to get?And I saw images from the SX40 (which I'd never heard of --and just came out 2 months ago, so no reviews yet). Fantastic! And the zoom! 24mm so nice and wide. 840mm at the telephoto...amazing!  All compact and lightweight for what you got. A new genre called a \"superzoom\" or \"bridge\" camera coming between the point and shoot and the DSLRs. And actually costing LESS than the s100!!!After deliberating for a month between the s100 (which I'd ordered, but wasn't in yet) and the T3i, I had found \"my\" camera. In less than 24 hours of finding it, I ordered.  And, really, it was love at first sight.There is so much that's great about this camera and Canon lays it all out well on this page. You get the idea--as much (or as little) creative control as you want. If you don't like to fiddle with controls, just put it on \"P\" and you'll get great pix without doing anything except \"point and shoot\" (well, and focus and stay still). But if you like to \"grow\" with a camera, it has a menu button that is easy to scroll through, settings that are easy to use, a mode dial right on the back that makes everything easy to find, a \"record\" button for video that is colored red so you can't miss it...couldn't be easier...or more fun!The only other things you might want to know are: it has a hot shoe, but doesn't shoot RAW (which I don't care about, but people who are heavily into post-processing are). There's no way to attach an external mike of your own, but the internal mike has two different settings and a wind filter--so, better that most, sound-wise. I put a 67mm lens adapter on to prevent vignetting and added a clear filter to protect the lens, that and a good memory card and a case and....good to go! I can't recommend this enough--it is a really fun camera (oh, and has macro as well) and using a long zoom like that is just really exciting if you like photography at all. (Check out the pics of the moon at dpreview. Amazing).  Highly recommended.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderfully versatile camera with a few limitations", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R3M943260NA0ZK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned and used the SX40 HS extensively for a full month now, and I am continuously delighted with the variety of shots I can capture without having to lug around multiple lenses and other gear. Let's start though with what you should and shouldn't expect out of this camera. Expect that the immense 35x zoom will allow you to take sharp photos your old camera couldn't even dream of capturing: close-ups of birds in flight, pleasing portraits, spectacular photos of the moon, and crystal clear flower and wildlife photos in colors that are very true to life. What you shouldn't expect though no matter how much you want it to be so: dslr quality images; especially if you are filming fast-action sports. The CMOS sensor on the SX40 is 6.17mm x 4.55mm whereas sensor sizes on typical APS-C sensors are around, let's say ~23.6mm x 15.7mm. I have never owned a dslr in my life, but I have seen the differences that the much larger (much much larger) sensors on those cameras can make. This isn't a dig on the SX40! Truly artistic and beautiful photos can come out of this camera, but just know that you will not get that sense of serious professional refinement and (dare I say) feeling that cameras with larger sensors will provide. The only truly aggravating image quality quirk is the propensity for highlights to be blown out. In areas of bright sun all you see sometimes is shiny white blur with no detail whatsoever. Lowering the exposure balance a notch or two usually corrects this but can lead to darker photos than you might want.This camera fit my specifications as well as I could hope while trying to stay within a (relatively) modest budget. For me this was a huge step up from my Olympus Tough rugged point-and-shoot (so I am no Canon fanboy), but at the same time was not an overwhelming step in terms of learning to use the camera. While all the buttons and wheels may seem daunting at first, the layout is rather intuitive and anything you can't set with the push of a dedicated button can be accessed by browsing through the simple menu system. One of my favorite things off the bat was to make custom settings for the styles I use most often. You can save these settings to either C1 or C2 on the mode dial for quick access. The 35x zoom is NOT excessive. In fact, I find myself going out to the telephoto end every single day and loving it. Perhaps the best feature of the camera is just how stable the telephoto shots are. The in-body stabilization is truly extraordinary. It has to be said though that in video mode the stabilization at extreme zooms will cause strange wobbling (think rubber pencil trick) if you move the camera too quickly to keep up with the action. The fully articulating lcd screen is a huge plus as well. Even if you're not used to it you will want to start bending it around as it allows you to stay much more comfortable when composing awkward shots. Battery life is also very adequate for me. On my several-hour-long hikes I will take upwards of two or three hundred photos and a few short videos with no fear whatsoever of low battery. If you take long videos or plenty of high-speed bursts though for things like sports photography you will see the battery drain more quickly.One sneaky thing about this camera is how it has coaxed me into growing as a photographer. On my older cameras I always stuck to P (program) mode and let the camera decide what was best for each shot. The more and more I use the SX40, the more I have been using manual (M) mode to add control and complexity to my photos. I've learned through trial and error that f/2.7 makes for a blurrier background than f/8.0. I have learned how to post-process my photos to draw out the most from each exposure. The versatility of the camera continually makes me want to push my limits and step out of my comfort zone in order to capture truly spectacular shots. What more could you ask for in a camera?Let's talk about a few of the complaints about this camera, namely that shutter speeds only go as slow as 15 seconds and that there is no RAW capability. Firstly I want to say that the DIGIC 5 processor does a fantastic job on the very fine JPEG setting. You will be hard pressed to capture more quality with less noise in RAW format.  Also, you really need to check out CHDK (Canon Hack Development Kit) which I have been using with great success for 3 weeks now. CHDK is a program that sits on your SD card and doesn't directly modify anything in your camera. It shouldn't even void your warranty (though I'm no lawyer). The program allows you to squeeze every last drop of performance out of your hardware. Shutter speed can be overridden to as long as 2,048 seconds! That's over half an hour! I haven't tried anything over 64 seconds though so use at your own risk. RAW images can also be saved with CHDK installed. The only truly unfixable issues are the physical/hardware limitations.Physical/hardware limitations, and yes there are a few. I mentioned earlier that highlights really get blown out sometimes. This can for the most part be fixed by shooting in RAW with CHDK and fixing them in a program like Gimp or Lightroom, but it's annoying that I have to spend the time to post-process to retrieve those highlights. Secondly, the autofocus kinda... sucks to be frank. Especially in low light situations, in manual mode, and at the telephoto end it has to search a bit more to find what you want it to find. Sometimes I just switch over to manual focusing which works better but is still rough due to the average quality of the electronic view finder and the only 230,000 dot liveview lcd screen. Some of the shots just don't want to come out in focus. The camera is also relatively slow in between photos, CHDK or not.To conclude, I believe that this camera is a fantastic fit for most casual to semi-serious nature, portrait, and still-life photographers who want excellent color replication, image quality, and zoom without breaking the bank. The advantage of traveling with this camera in a small bag slung over your shoulder versus pounds and pounds of dslr equipment cannot be overstated either. Perhaps the best advice I can give is that you shouldn't fret for hours over camera review websites comparing noise levels of 100% cropped images at 1600 ISO or you will never spend less than $1,000 on a camera. Go to a camera store and get the camera in your hands and play around with it. If you have reasonable expectations about how the camera will perform, then I think you will be thrilled to choose the SX40 HS.Without question I am in love with this camera, but that doesn't mean I refuse to acknowledge its limitations.

Zoom is terrific, as is the image stabilization.I still have my dSLR for my professional needs, but for an all-around point and shoot that's several cuts above the average P&S;, this is a nice piece of equipment.For anyone getting image blur, you are not using a high enough shutter speed.  With the camera set to manual, you should be able to play around with the shutter speed.  Review your images.  The metadata will tell you what your shutter speed was on an exposure.  If you are trying to photograph a horse race @ 1/30 of a second, no image stabilization will save you.

We took each of them out into the field for one day and also did some head-to-head comparison shots under realistic conditions. The SX40 was the clear winner of the contest. Our review is based on the performance for our particular purpose, but will likely apply to anyone that will use the max zoom frequently. If looking for a general purpose camera, neither of the two is a good choice. A 30+ zoom involves technical compromises that will render these models inferior to others under more typical conditions.Here are the details:- Auto focus: Focusing with an 800mm + lens is a challenge for any camera. One should expect that depending on the exact circumstances focusing may take a few seconds and sometimes fails altogether. Given that, both models performed surprisingly well. However, the SX40 somewhat outperformed the P510 in speed and reliability. This is an important factor for us, as birds often do not wait for us zooming in on them.- Image quality: At the same zoom level, the SX40 has a noticeably sharper image. The P510 suffers from being \"over-pixeled\" with its 16MP sensor. Compared to the SX40 the pictures are visibly noisy. Contrast and color rendering of the SX40 are also superior.- Long zoom: The P510 has a longer zoom, up to 1000 35mm equivalent vs. 840 for the SX40. Here is the bad news: If you take a picture at 840mm with P510 and crop to what it would be at 1000mm, you get a higher quality picture compared to a picture taken at 1000mm. In short the optical zoom is inferior to a digital zoom, and it is shockingly obvious. As mentioned, the 840mm picture is still worse than the SX40 picture at the its max zoom level. This was really the deciding factor for us.- Weight and size: The P510 is a bit smaller and noticeably lighter than the SX40. Not enough to really matter for us, but it could be relevant for some people.- Somewhat minor, but a bit annoying: The design of SX40 lens cover is poor: Hard to put on, easy to fall off.Summary: Both cameras are good choices if you are looking for an easy to carry camera that lets you zoom up to near 1000mm and take reasonably sharp picture without a tripod. Given that this was beyond laughable just a few years ago, it is difficult to be to harsh with either model. However, the SX40 clearly outperforms the P510 in image quality.

The SX30 did not.  Try to set the ISO at 400 for a night shot, and then spin the dial towards a 15 second shutter speed. It stops it at 1 second and drops the ISO to 100. Then a message appears on the LCD which says, \"ISO speed is limited due to slow shutter speed.\" I verified it with the Canon Tech Dept. They also verified that the previous Canon cameras DID allow full Manual control in setting both the ISO and shutter speed, but no more.This has halted a large portion of the sunset and night photography I have been doing of the Monterey Bay Harbor for the past 2 years. It is condescending and insulting to adults in general and to long-term Canon users in particular to presume to say to us, \"We think you don't know what you are doing, you must be an errant child, and we have put a childproof governor on the SX40 so that you cannot use those manual settings anymore.\" Obviously if we use a Manual setting it is precisely because we do know what we are doing!  Canon needs to UPGRADE its firmware to make the SX40 at least as good as the SX30, not DOWNGRADE its features to make it worse.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&UPDATE:  Many of you have asked me for an example of nighttime time-exposure photos* of Monterey Bay Harbor for comparison. Here it is.* [When I first made the video I did not yet understand the subtle distinction between \"time-exposure\" and \"time-lapse\" photos. The more precise term is \"time-exposure,\" but the video still shows the less accurate term \"time-lapse.\"]I agree that overall the Canon SX40 is an excellent camera. I still use mine during the daytime. I am not arguing about \"overall.\" That is not my point.For me, personally, the SX40 has a fatal flaw, and a flaw that no one would normally expect in a camera of this caliber and price range.  It won't take simple time-exposure night shots. Why not?I had to buy an older SX30 just to \"upgrade\" my full use of it.  If you think that having to pay twice for what should have come in one camera in the first place put me in a good mood, then you would be mistaken.You may watch this short video, if you like, and see the evidence for yourself.  If you disagree, then by all means please show me your evidence.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&SECOND UPDATE:  There is another limit on the SX40.

After five months of fighting  against this, I have now been fully vindicated by the openness and honesty of the Fujifilm corporation. I shall now be taking my leave of you on this post and I will be returning to my former routine of enjoying my own photography.  See Page 22 of the Comments section for details.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&AFTERMATH UPDATE:  March 31, 2012;  I have come to the conclusion that the Canon SX40 is like a thoroughbred race horse penned up in a stable made for a dimwitted donkey. It is a camera with a tremendous potential over a wide range of photographic interests that is being held trapped inside a childproof box.  After having tested the camera myself with CHDK - a form of public, hacker software for the camera, available for free download on the internet - I can see that the ISO limit is only a very small part overall of what is actually being limited. When you take those limits off of it by using CHDK, what the SX40 camera really can do is absolutely staggering.I don't like having to resort to a hacker program like CHDK to get the settings I want with the SX40.  Unfortunately, it seems that CHDK is simply \"the only game in town\" if you want to have the freedom to use the Canon SX40 to its fullest potential.

I am not even an amateur photographer. I just want really great family photos. Ones that I can crop and edit and still have a focused picture for my scrapbook when all is said and done. I think a DSLR is too much camera for me, but something that fits in my pocket isn't enough. What to do? Here's the chronological account of my hunt:1. Own Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR3.  Love it because:  - It does a decent job at capturing the moment - especially in sports mode (more equiv. to burst than sports).  - Takes decent video, although if you capture a still-shot from the video it is a little grainy.  - Portability. It is great to have a decent (i.e. not smartphone) camera in your purse at all times.  Wish it could:  - Take even higher res photos (because I always thought higher megapixels = higher quality photo, which I now know to only be partly true.)  - Zoom farther so I don't have to crop as much2. Panasonic has manufacturer defect that created dark spots on my photos. They send me a new one. New one is great, but eventually has same problem, now out of warranty. Disenchanted with Panasonic quality, I decide to look at other options.3. I see a Nikon flyer and drool at the V1 & P500. Ashton Kutcher sucks me in, and I'm poised for a Nikon b/c it seems sexy and hip. (Score one for marketing, negative point for stupid girl sucked in by such things. I don't even like Ashton Kutcher, I just like the marketing. Isn't that so sad. But, I digress...) Check snapsort.com, read reviews, and visit local photo shop. V1 is out of my price range, and I am liking the specs on the P500 - check out taht zoom! We compare to Canon T3 DSLR. I had trouble deciding between the super-zoom digicam and DSLR, but settle in the end on the P500. I walk out with the Nikon, a little uneasy about the choice, but excited that I have a Nikon, feeling all, \"I've got a cool camera!\" happy. I do not open it or play with it as I am under strict orders that it must wait until Christmas. And, I love my husband, so I wait. Man, I hope I made the right choice!4. It is now Christmas morning - the moment I've been waiting for! I unwrap the package and take out my new sexy, hip Nikon to begin taking shots of our family gathering and my especially adorable niece. Love her! Anyway, I snap away on the standard settings with no flash (I think one day I read a blog that said try without, and I liked it and stuck with it.) As I look at what I've shot so far, many are very blurry! I fiddle with the settings, ensure the image stabilization is on, etc. Yep. All is well, and this should be shooting decent photos. I decide to shoot a few with flash open. Well, there is marked improvement for sure, but it took forever to focus. All morning I'd fiddle and snap, fiddle and snap. And, the more I used it the more I didn't like it. My photos were blurry, but what was perfectly clear is that I was duped by marketing. I do NOT love this camera. Tear. I shoot the rest of the day in video mode.5. I resolved to head back to the photo shop. I knew one of two things: there was something wrong with the camera or there was something wrong with me. Either way, I needed a solution. I expected to hear something like, \"You just don't know what you're doing...\" but I didn't. They were even able to reproduce the same effect in the store. I showed them my pictures, and they looked at the settings, unable to see why it was shooting that way. In the end, they just said they thought it was working an awful lot to make all the adjustments. I decided I wouldn't be happy with it and had better try something else. I assumed my only other choice was to upgrade and move into the DSLR, and so we started looking at the T3. I just didn't want to spend that much, that's all. I know, it has all these great things about it and it can grow with me, blah blah blah. But I do not want to be a photographer. I just want good family photos, and is it worth spending $650 (a package with two lenses) for some decent scrapbook photos? I'm thinking maybe we should just go back to the little Panasonic. It was a good little camera, after all. But, I figure I can anti up, so \"I'll take it.\" comes out of my mouth. As fate would have it, they were out of stock. So they order one and I prepare to leave.6. At home, I give it a last ditch effort. My husband asks, \"So, tell me again - what's the advantage of the DSLR??\" and I say, \"Well, we gan grow with it and get add'l lenses, etc. To which he replies, \"Are we going to get new lenses?\" And I realize: I don't want the DSLR. It's more camera than I need, but especially more camera than I want. I don't want a big bulky thing. I want big zoom in a little package. I go to Sam's Club for groceries, now completely unsure of myself in this camera escapade. I walk in a spy the Canon & Nikons on display right near the front. Nothing like salt on the wound! But, then I spot it: the Canon SX40 HS. Hey - that's just like the Nikon P500, but Canon. Why didn't they show me that at the photo shop? (Side note: I decided at this point that my suspicions were correct: my local shop offered me nothing more than I could get online. In fact, I got BETTER info online than in the store.) I called the shop from right there at Sam's. \"Oh, I didn't think of that!\" he says. (Seriously, I have a Nikon P500 I like the idea of, but it isn't performing, and you don't think to show me the Canon counterpart? What a joke.)7. Back to the photo store to check out the SX40. (B/c of the return policy I have to shop there. Otherwise, I wouldn't.) As I play with it, I feel the \"Canon-ness\" of it. You know. Canon just has a feel about it. It even sounds like a Canon. I think this may just be it. I decide I am not going to be an amateur photographer, I just want family photos, dang it! I am not going to buy a big DSLR, I am getting the SX 40. We make the Nikon-Canon swap and I head home with the Canon SX40 HS.8. I LOVE THIS CAMERA! The zoom is UNBELIEVABLE! The photos are crisp, and clear - no blur! The high-speed burst just spits 'em out! Hoorah! It just feels right! I took photos in low light last night, and in snow cover today. I just know that this will be a great camera for upgraded general-use. I don't care about the ISO limitation others complain about. I am not taking time lapse photos as night, and generally don't take photos at night, anyway. I don't care about \"full\" manual control b/c I don't know enough about ISO or shutter speed to change it, anyway. And, I don't have the time to learn right now. The built-in setting on this camera will be perfectly fine for what I want, and I am SO glad we chose this. It's hard not to feel like to you have an inferior product, since it isn't a DSLR, but this product is more than what we need. It is superior to average point & shoot. It is a SUPER zoom.So, if you are just looking for a really great camera, with good solid specs that will take good overall photos, then look no further - and don't visit your local photo shop. Just do your research online, read the reviews, use snapsort.com to review the specs (ignore the Nikon P500) and click \"Add to Cart\" on the Canon SX 40 HS.

So unless you are shooting in a club, concert or any loud place, you will not notice but your daily run of the mill movie clips its very easily picked up.Then i decided to get the Sony Hx9v and guess what?? that camera is worst than the 7 megapixel canon i have had before. Its colors in pictures are very saturated on the camera LCD and once you transfer it to the computer they look dull, blurry and NOT 16 megapixels that Sony advertises.

I wanted the longer zoom, 1080p movie capability, and better low light sensitivity that Canon advertises for the SX40.  I picked the camera up at Wal-mart last night since they had them for $379 and I just purchased my accessories through Amazon.  I'm trying to decide whether to gift my G9 to my daughter and did a quick comparison between the G9 and SX40.  I took pics in the back yard this morning at the zoom extents of the G9 and tried to match their field of view with the SX40 zoom position; I then took extra pics with the SX40 at it's full zoom extents.Okay, this thing takes good pictures, but the first thing I noticed was the size of the JPG was roughly half of the G9.  I knew the RAW support was absent on the SX40, but I wasn't expecting the JPG quality would also be limited; in Canon terms it has a \"fine\" but no \"superfine\" JPG setting.  There are some obvious changes in the image processing on the DIGIC chip (G9=III, SX40=5), generally for the good, but in one case it removed some fine detail, that while pleasing in the image, differed from what was actually there.  It's possible a different mode or turning off image stabalization wouldn't have done this.  Overall I am pleased because I knew mostly what not to expect in advance, and it's quite impressive seeing ants and plant fuzz when zoomed on grass that is 20 feet away... something that required close-up mode previously.  Since the vacation will offer sweeping landscapes and the opportunity of animals at a distance, it will do what I want it to do.First impression of the mechanism was that it looks good, but feels somehow partly-filled when compared to the metal G9 with everything in a smaller and denser body... this is obviously true as the lens portion is mostly empty space; from a shooting perspective weight is sufficient for stability and it fits good in the hand.  The variable-speed zoom actuator is noisy and not too smooth, which for stills in okay, but a big negative for video.  There is no external microphone jack to get away from the sound when shooting video, but as suggested by Canon themselves, set your zoom before shooting video.Some comments about the Canon camera's and my thoughts on their technology rollout.  The G9 is a 12.1 MPixel as is the SX40; so both shoot a maximum image size of 3000x4000 pixels.  The G series in the past was considered closer to the pro SLR models than the S/SX series, as many in the series offer raw mode and extensive manual capabilities.  I feel Canon has fallen down on the G however; the newer G series (at G12 now) have dropped their resolution to 10 MPix, which seems a big step backwards to me.  I looked at the the current SLR line, and the 5D Mark III is sweet, but I'm not ready to pay over $3200 to get camera body and lenses to approach the zoom range of the SX40.  The Rebel's and other sub 5D models are problematic since their CCD size adds a 1.6x multiplier to the lens attached to them.  Canon's tech is there to put a truly fantastic intrrument in any of their camera bodies, but they are always holding a few things back to guide pro-sumers toward the more expensive units.  For instance, this SX40 should have all the features of the G9 I purchased over 4 years ago; the capability is in the chip, just not brought out in the firmware.  When combined with the longer zoom range, Canon may have felt this would have encroached too much on their SLR line, but what they failed to understand is I would have paid more to get RAW, a non-\"ISO\"-limited long exposure time (mentioned extensively in another post), a smoother zoom operation, and an external mic jack.  If, as it seems they intend to limit their \"point and shoots\" to 12MPix at the moment, then they should have 2 tiers of SLR at 18MPix and 24MPix and all with a 1x CCD size lens modifier.  Though, as much as I loved my old Canon A-1 film camera, lugging around various lenses is not something I miss, so there is that downside to moving \"up\" to an SLR again; I would greatly appreciate the mentioned features in a point and shoot, but when it comes time for the next upgrade in another couple years, I'll want those plus 16 MPix or better.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Almost Great, But Not Quite. 4.5 Stars", "Author": "Ethan Winning \"Ethan Winning\"", "ReviewID": "R1EHG6EKDJDOT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "May 23, 2012 - Having now taken more than 20,000 photos with this camera, the review remains 4.5 stars. There is still an issue with taking pictures in low light, and I'm talking about cloudy days, not in a darkened room. At times, I do have to move to Auto or my presets under P(rogram) mode. This takes away some of the creative aspects, but overall, I'm still quite pleased with the SX40.***Nov. 3, 2011 and Jan. 13, 2012 - [Please see posted photos here and noncommercial web site from my first days' and most recent shootings. A picture is worth a thousand words. Note that I purchase the camera only, not this package, but ultimately ended up with extra battery, and 16gb card. The card reader should be unnecessary.] I will do a complete review as the weather clears and I can take some photos in various light conditions. So far, it has performed well enough, but there is a learning curve from the SX20 which allowed greater latitude in overriding what the camera \"wants to do.\"It may take a month before I can review the camera adequately, so I have uploaded some photos that I took on the first day, and I must say that they're pretty good. However, there were only 8 out of 51 taken. ...And then it started to rain. Please note that I am not new to the Canon line or (nature) photography: I have had the A620, S3, S5, SX10, SX20, and now the SX40. (I returned the SX30 which was a terrible disappointment.) And I've been taking pictures for over 60 years. So, unless you really get to know the camera - and even then - you may or may not get the results that I do.On that note, I might add that I was sorely disappointed that Canon didn't pop for a printed manual which, with this camera, is a must. Unlike the SX20 for which I could use the SX10 manual, this camera is quite different and - so far - I think more complex or at least more different than the SX20. Because of the issues that I've run into just in 3 days, it's very difficult to cross-reference what it says under Av with Tv or C1. This is not the basic point-and-shoot Elph, and I rarely shoot in \"Auto.\" As I said, I have to give it a couple of weeks before I'll pass judgment.I must say that the photos that WERE already posted when I bought the camera gave me some trepidation in that so many were a little washed out. What I am finding so far is that, \"Auto\" might well be \"Average.\" Average aperture, Average speed, Average contrast. But I purchased it anyway, and I've already found that Av or Tv or M are still the best settings although, unlike the SX20 where one could just set the speed and the camera would use the setting, I had to save the Tv settings to C1 or C2. This became routine by my third day (today).Nov. 8, 2011:Five days since I got the camera, and three days of shooting. I must say I've never seen so many comments regarding reviews, and many people have agreed with the more negative comments. What I've found is that the quality of photos I've taken have been excellent, needing very little post-production diddling. That said, and having used the burst mode, I'm deleting 4/5ths of the pix that I've taken, some because of duplication, some because of focus, and some because I just screwed up.In looking at the negative comments, I would admonish people to decide before buying this camera - or any other camera - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO USE THE CAMERA FOR??? I take pictures of nature, some scenery, but mostly birds, bugs, bunnies, bees, bears, and begonias. The SX40 HS has done very well in these areas, and I realize that there is a learning curve for such extreme focal lengths and the macro (which I rarely use).If you're going to take night time shots - which seems to have garnered so much comment about viewfinders and such - I can't address it. I took a picture of the (harvest) moon, hand-held, in Tv mode and it came out beautifully. But I don't take many nighttime pix, and I haven't had a chance to take fireworks in years. (If I want snapshots of people or parties, I use my wife's Elph.)I am still having some difficulty in overriding what the camera is set for re: aperture and speed. The SX20 could be overridden just by setting the speed to 1/2500th and one would get a much darker picture which could then be adjusted with software. Sometimes, it's the only way to get realistic clouds. With the SX40, I set it for 1/2500 and when I shoot, the camera comes down to 1/1600 or slower. IF I ever get the printed manual that Canon promised, I'll look for the menu where I can increase the value of the photo by -3 to +3. Yeah, I'm being a little lazy, but I hate the .pdf manual on disc that came with the camera.On the plus side, by coming down to 12 mp from 14 and by improving the processor, I can finally get SOME pix in low light or at least on a cloudy day. I've posted a few photos from the past few days: the two of the golden-crowned sparrows and the hummer were taken in low light and in thickets. They came out as sharp as anything I've ever taken with the SX10 or 20 (or S3 or S5 etc. etc.). Another plus, I am not having as much trouble with the SX40 focusing on a bird in the middle of a tree. The camera spots the center and at least HALF the time immediately seems to understand I want the bird not the branches.IF every photo I took came out perfectly, where's the fun in photography? Yes, sometimes the SX40 frustrates me, but Mother Nature sometimes frustrates me. Sometimes I think Mother Nature is picking on me. I ALWAYS though that Canon picked on everybody. After all, why do they come out with an improvement (?) every 10-12 months? Okay, the SX30 was terrible...I'll continue this in another week or so. For the time being, what I really like is the sharp photos I've been getting, and the 8 fps in the burst mode (the third is usually the best). I'm still not crazy about is the lack of an override for Tv and Av even using the C1, and I THINK the viewfinder is smaller than the SX20.Oh, btw, this camera is a few crucial (after a 5 hour hike) ounces less than the SX20. It's probably because it has a proprietary battery instead of the 4 AAs. I like the weight. What I don't like is that Canon wants $59 for a second battery, and has warned me about buying from \"the secondary market.\" Comments? Suggestions? I'd appreciate knowing if there's a reliable battery that will work with this camera. (One of the other dealers offering a second battery as part of the SX40 HS package has been called out for offering a battery that doesn't fit the SX40!)I think it's silly to say that the LCD isn't as clear as a computer monitor. Never had one that was, and I'm often disappointed when something that looks in focus on the LCD is not nearly as sharp on my computer. After 12 years of digital photography, I've become accustomed to it. At least I didn't waste any film and have to wait two weeks to find out that my vacation pix are lousy.Still 4 stars for the features, 5 for the photos I've taken, and 3.5 for Canon engineers.Nov. 14, 2011.I posted more photos which speak for themselves. However, there is a caveat: I took 191 photos this morning mostly of deer, wild turkey, hawks, one praying mantis, and one tarantula. Of the 191, I posted (on my own site) 9. Here, I posted 5. And I kept 11. 180 were deleted, and that brings up two points. The burst mode of 8 fps works. That is, the SX40 really can shoot at 8 frames per second. However, not all will be in focus; many will be identical shots; and it is not the panacea for carefully composing and focusing and being at the right setting. (If you need the burst mode, you may be best off in Tv because speed is what you're after.)And please note: The battery is rated at being able to take 400 photos at the highest resolution and using the viewfinder (380 using the LCD). Well, if you shoot in the burst mode often or you take \"movies,\" expect your battery to go in about 250 shots - and that's fast at 8 fps. I have just purchased two more batteries and, though they're not Canon \"approved\" because they're 1/4th the price, I'm hoping that I now will never run out of batteries while shooting. Will report on that when I get them.Just one note re: the battery indicator. When the battery indicator is down from 3 (full) to 2 bars, it only takes 3-5 more photos to get it to show red and Charge the Battery. This isn't a lot more helpful than the old SX20 which allowed about 10 shots when it said to change the battery without any precursor. I was really looking forward to having a real battery indicator. This ain't it. Still 4.5 stars.Nov. 22, 2011I started this review on Nov. 3 by saying, \"So far so good,\" but I had a few reservations. I no longer have reservations, and would definitely recommend the SX40 to anyone who is more than a novice photographer. This is not a \"simple\" point and shoot, and you may get more than what you need or even want.It takes great photos, but you still have to know how to tweak its capabilities. If you're just going to keep this at \"Auto,\" then you don't need this camera. However, if you really want such features as taking movies and using \"my colors\" and a quasi-fisheye mode, this may very well be the camera for you. If you want to take pictures in RAW, this is not the camera for you (it doesn't have RAW). I care about none of these things, so for me the camera gets 4.5 stars. If you want those features, this camera may be only a 3 or 4.So basically, I'm content with my purchase. There's no second-guessing. No alternative would have made me happier. I REALLY like it, but I don't love it. BUT look at it this way: if I got perfect pictures every time, it would take all the fun out of digital photography.

I was looking for a camera with a mega zoom lens. I had looked at similar products from Sony and Panasonic, but decided to settle for Canon SX40HS based mainly on the customers' reviews at Amazon website.I am very happy with my decision. I took my camera to Cancun on vacation. I got some wonderful pictures of architecturally rich buildings, traditionally dressed people,innocuous iguanas,sunny beaches and stunning sunrises and sunsets. I have shared on this site a few pictures taken with SX40HS to show the versatility of this camera. Please note that all these pictures were taken using the auto functions. I Shall be trying the manual functions within the next few weeks.Although I have been taking pictures since 1952, I do not consider myself to be more than an amateur photographer. This is my third point-and-shoot digital camera. I still use my other two  great cameras: Olympus SP350 and Sony DSC H2 with Carl Zeiss 12x zoom lens.I did not go for a DSLR camera because I had found the 35mm SLR cameras to be too heavy and cumbersome to handle. I had a wonderful Konica T4 SLR camera with a full range of zoom and wide angle lenses. I used it on only special occasions. For my regular photography I had ended up using a Nikon point-and-shoot 35mm film camera with which I was very happy.The only problem I found with this camera is that some of the function buttons are located where you would normally put your right hand thumb while holding the camera. It is easy to inadvertently press the unintended function button. However, there is a recessed place to place the right thumb; however, it takes getting used to it. This is a minor problem and can be avoided by exercising a little caution.Canon SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch Vari-Angle Wide LCD.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon SX 40 review from a pro", "Author": "CAamazonshopper", "ReviewID": "RXGRTXRJQWIVD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera (small considering the lens range) and I recently used it as my only camera on a trip to San Diego.  I deliberately left my professional gear at home as I was not on photography business and wanted to really give this camera a run for its money.The zoom to about an 800 mm equivalent is a fine feature.  The wide angle end of the scale is not too bad either. The optical stabilizer works well. I have a steady hand, but any time you use that long a telephoto optical stabilization is not an option, it's a MUST.  The main thing to remember is that this is NOT a DSLR.  It does not focus or respond as quickly as a DSLR, and it will not have the low-light performance of a DSLR.  If you bear that in mind, plan your shots, and pre-focus action scenes, you can get excellent results.  I found it quite acceptable for candid shots at events, flowers, animals not in quick motion, buildings, scenery (up to about 12 x 24 size print) and the typical subjects you may wish to shoot as you travel.  The SX40 was a little too slow in response to catch children diving into the water even when pre-focused. That's a tough task anyway. It took a lot of anticipation to get a few good good shots.  However, when the timing was right, I got excellent, very clear, mid-flight images.  I would not recommend this camera, or ANY non-DSLR, for sports or fast action situations.  It is nice that the SX40 takes an external flash.  Lack of that option is a major shortfall for most consumer-class cameras.  This camera is now in my bag everywhere I travel.  I carry it in a black sling-style bag that also holds other essentials for a traveler: my wife's make-up, various medications useful to travelers, sun-block, bug repellent pads, tissues, spare batteries, and the snake bite kit.

From the FZ20, I moved up to the FZ28 and then the FZ35 and finally, I got the FZ100, which I use as a expensive paperweight.After the FZ100 debacle, I started looking for a new brand of SuperZoom and after 2 previous hiccups buying and returning highly hyped, but not delivering cameras, I came across the SX40 HS at my local club store and bought it just on it's specs and hoping the Canon name would deliver. What also helped in my decision was the knowledge that the club had a 90 day return policy, not a 30 day one like Amazon.I bought the camera on my way to work and when I got home I wanted to see if I could unpack it, toss in the battery and go out and get a good Moon shot without having any previous experience with Canon digital's. Would it be so intuitive that I could get a really good shot of the Moon without having ever held one in my hand, without even looking at the manual? I wanted to know.The answer was yes. I turned the dial to Manual and in no time I had the correct setting and got much better hand-held Moon shots than anything I've ever gotten from my Panasonic's on a tripod.I'm still a work on progress and I haven't had a chance to test it out in all the areas I use them in, like indoor shots of blues bands in small clubs. So far I've been super happy with it.The only downside's that I have with it is that a second battery is gonna cost me almost $70 and that Canon doesn't supply a paper manual for it. You get a disk and the manual is 200+ pages in PDF, which doesn't work for me. I took the disk to a local quick print place and they refused to make me a paper copy of the manual because the disk is copyrighted. The saving grace in all of this is that Canon has pretty good customer service and after talking to their rep on the phone I was able to get them to make me a nice full size copy, which they sent to me free of charge.

The low light image quality has been markedly improved, as well as the color rendering.  The shot-to-shot time is now acceptably fast.Because of the improved low light performance, I now can leave the camera in auto-iso when shooting in P mode.  On the SX30 I never went beyond ISO 400.  I find that not having to adjust the ISO as frequently makes it less likely to miss shots.The only regret I have is that Canon changed the battery for the camera - so I can no longer use the extra battery I bought for the SX30  (Canon batteries are outrageously expensive in my opinion).I also own a Canon 60D with 55-250 zoom.  I had been using this camera for low light photos and when image quality was of paramount importance.  I believe the SX40hs now produces high enough quality photos for me to consider selling the 60D with lenses.All-in-all Canon has finally produced a superzoom that is close enough to an SLR to be completely satisfactory.

Joo", "ReviewID": "R11IN8J2N8V696", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update: January 2, 2012The more and more I play with this camera the less I use the 50D.  Sure, there is no substitute for RAW and greater flexibility/creativity that the 50D offers; however, I love carrying one camera that meets 95% of my needs with decent photo quality.  The holidays offered me many chances to play with the camera and I continue to be impressed.I was surprised that Auto Exposure Bracket (AEB) works fairly well.  The delay between shots are about a second each.  Of course, this isn't ideal for moving subjects; however, it is great for fixed objects.  I also like the fact that a timer can be used to eliminate camera shaking and photo alignment for HDRI processing.  Also, the first shot is exposed in the middle of the AEB range making this mode somewhat usable for moving subject with fixed tripod shooting.The DIGIC 5 processor really seems to have significantly better Auto shooting mode.  I now find myself using Auto over P mode for most of my shooting.  This is especially ideal for handing the camera over to others to shoot the photographer...with pretty nice results.The built in flash along with better light sensitivity from the CMOS sensor (along with other improvements in the HS system) yields really nice indoor photos.The video mode is also quite useful; however, it won't replace my Panasonic HD camcorder.  The motor noise is especially noticeable in quiet environments and the lack of audio input eliminates any possibility of overcoming this problem.  Also, it is not natural to shoot videos while grasping the camera like, well, a camera.  The slow motion video; however, is fantastic.  I'm really thrilled to have 240 fps (320x240 pixels) capability to shoot the kids skateboarding...there is a lot going on during an Ollie.  I also like the ability to reduce fps to get better video (120 fps with 640x480).Canon put a lot of capabilities in a small package.  I'm sure this camera will be getting quite a work out...that's a great thing!==================================Original review: December 26, 2011You can read my 2 star rating for the SX30IS that I purchased a year ago to get a rundown on 6 issues I had with that camera.  SX40HS solves 2 issues fully and partially addresses one of them (shoots 1080p; CMOS for better low light; response time is better but not stellar).  These improvements on what appears to be virtually identical camera make this camera superior to all other super-zoom cameras.  Further, I've started to note some improvements in \"Auto\" mode's ability to properly identify the scenery and make proper adjustments.  With the SX30IS I couldn't trust \"Auto\" to do the job properly.  Having said this, I'll probably continue shooting primarily in \"P\" mode; but, it is good to note that \"Auto\" seems to work as promised.The CMOS sensor (and a step down in resolution) seems to produce far better indoor shots with much less noise.  As others have stated already, I'd love to see RAW capability in this camera; however, I fully understand the niche that this camera is to fill.  RAW would make this camera a perfect companion for my Canon 50D.The 35x zoom seems to have received some additional stability controls.  I've posted couple of photos to demonstrate how sharp the images are at maximum zoom range (see photos of \"Iron Mountain\" with a horseback rider).  I shot these photos at more that quarter mile away and, to my amazement, I was able to read the writing on the saddle!  Other shots I've taken from a great distance revealed details that floored me.  The SX30IS had more blur and noise at 35x zoom; thus, Canon added improvements that make the 35x zoom very usable.  Of course, issues like barrel distortion and such will force you to spend some time fixing the images.After my bad experience with the SX30IS, I took a chance on this camera and found that it meets my expectations and makes up for most of the issues I've had with the SX30IS.  You'll note from my review of that camera that the SX30IS is only one of 2 Canon cameras that disappointed me; SX40HS is a winner!", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon SX40HS", "Author": "Robert L.

It was a bit larger than I expected.  In fact, it's only slightly smaller than a regular Canon DSLR, so if you're buying this to lug around all day instead of a bulky heavy DSLR, you're going to practically carry around the same sized camera (minus a gigantic 800mm zoom lens, so you do shave off some significant lens bulk).  Despite the size, there was much to like about the SX40.  The image quality was great, even better than a G10 I owned a few years ago.  I never bought the G12, so I can't compare the quality to that, but several online forums say the quality is as good or even better than the G12 (these are forum opinions, not mine).  The CMOS sensor produced crisp sharp photos with nice color saturation.  The video quality was equally as impressive, rivaling my ACVHD camcorder.  Sound quality was also great with barely noticeable motor noise when zooming.  The biggest problem I encountered, which ultimately caused me to return it, was sporadic auto-focus.  In a nutshell, it just missed way too many shots.  The worst part is, these were static subjects, not moving targets.  Funny thing is, it actually perfectly froze a fast moving shot I took of an automobile but couldn't focus on several still subjects I was trying to photograph in moderate light.  The AF just kept hunting but could never find the proper focus.  As a result, one-third of my shots were blurry and out of focus despite adequate focal length.  Maybe I got a lemon, but a 66% success rate was unacceptable.  I tried numerous times to adjust but the camera was just too temperamental.  It's a shame because I really liked the camera other than that one flaw.  I've read about random AF issues with the latest Canon HS cameras.  I guess you just have to get lucky and get a good one.

I would normally have given this camera a 5 star rating if not for a few disappointments in this version.  Most annoying is the hissing sound that occurs when zooming while shooting a movie.  It ruins every movie where ambient noise is minimal.  Don't know what happened with Canon because this was not a problem in earlier models.  The other disappointment is no wireless remote capability.  Canon chose to add this feature to a few of its previous cameras, but it is not on the SX40.

This camera performed very well in almost every situation.I used it with the ring adaptor (Canon Filter Adapter FA-DC67A) for a permanent lens filter.I got very good night shots with a Canon Speedlite 270 EXII external flash set.I was pending with the battery load indicator, in order not to making it work on its lowest limit.Everything was nice and easy...

However, there are some things that really need to be experienced firsthand to understand fully.This camera is a bridge camera, and I bought it to bridge the gap between my pocket cameras (sx130is) and my dslr (rebel xs). In that regard it is a bittersweet compromise across the board.The pocket camera doesnt limit ISO speeds with 1 second or longer Tv like the sx40hs, nor does the rebel xs. The 1080p video is really nice to have, so that puts the sx40hs ahead of the rebel xs in that regard. But even the sx130is does 720p video and the rebel xs does not do video at all.So to focus on the camera at issue:Things I liked...Stereo mics1080p videoAuto exposure bracketing to enable HDR photographyTwo user configured custom modesArticulating screenLong zoomSlow motion video modeHot shoeThings I didnt like...Lack of depth of field preview buttonBayonet mount instead of threads for mounting filtersNo ext. microphone jackElectronic viewfinder resolution is poorNoisy focusingDifficulty focusing at longer end of zoom rangeRequires locking exposure before shifting aperture/shutter values in program modeCrippled manual mode with arbitrary factory imposed ISO limitationLack of sunset and stars modes in creative zoneProprietary batteryNo battery grips availableNo waterproof housing availableAll in all I really like the added flexibility this camera gives over the pocket cameras. Its still small enough to pack around. I will take more pictures simply by virtue of not having to drag a camera bag with multiple lenses and accessories around. But it will not replace a true slr anytime soon. The proprietary battery is less convenient becuase it will require purchasing a spare to carry along to ensure no interruption in shooting. The ISO limitation is annoying, but the situations for which it becomes limiting are infrequent enough for the pictures I like to take that it didn't deter me from buying. The biggest disappointments were the image quality of the electronic viewfinder,  and the strange fiddly requirement that you lock the xposure value before shifting shutter/aperture values in program mode. No matter though, it just forces me to decide whether depth of field or freezing (or blurring) motion is the priority, and I choose Av or Tv modes and adjust accordingly.One particularly nice feature that I wasnt expecting was the two user configured custom modes. I have one set for auto exposure bracketing of two stops either side of the metered exposure and just dial it in when I want to take an HDR image. I also wish the camera would accept threaded filters directly instead of relying on an adapter. The bayonet mount is a nice way to attach a lens hood but even with post processing eliminating the need for almost every filter, a lot of us like to keep a UV filter in place to protect the lens, and there are still plenty of situations where you will want a neutral density filter to allow a longer exposure under bright conditions.Overall I'm happy with the camera and will learn to work within it's limitations while appreciating the creative options it affords in other areas, and will use it a lot more than my dslr just because it is easier to bring along.UPDATE 3/25/2013After using this camera for a few months I wanted to give a little update. There are some things that really I have discovered through long term use that I might not have noticed in my excitement over a new toy, and some capabilities I wasn't aware of. Overall my 3 star rating stays the same, because the nice things are still tainted by a few flaws. The shutter lag is undeniable, and it makes it impossible to capture a fleeting expression on my daughter's face. If the Camera can't capture the exact moment you see the instant you press the shutter button, it sevsrely limits it's usefulness for any kind of action photography. I still a great camera for posed portraits, landscapes, and things that hold still. But it is going to frustrate you trying to take pictures of things that move. You will develop your ability to anticipate what is going to happen next in a scene and try to get ahead of it with this camera.On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier in my review about the custom settings, that is a tremendous advantage! I have one of the presets set up just like (P) rogram mode, but with a smaller image size. So when I want to snap a quick low resolution image to share online I can just dial to that preset. For HDR it has really been great. Almost all my HDR is shot from a tripod so I have the image stabilizer turned off, auto exposure bracketing set to two stop spread, and the ISO set to 100 among other things. I don't have to remember the settings, just dial in the present and it remembers everything.

Using my Canon SLR was being more of a chore due to the excess weight I'd have to carry around for hours.Also the 35X zoom was a major point for my buying this camera. I'd be in preserves with my SLR and long zooms and after a few hours would be exhausted. When you're tired you become careless about your shots, and I'd sometimes be unhappy with my images. Being a Canon user for years piqued my interest. Well I couldn't be more satisfied. Its light in weight, easy to carry around and with the new processor takes pictures comparable to my SLR's.You can take superb pictures, handheld,  with the 35X zoom. Still having the SX30 and comparing them, the SX40 appears to be faster, better in low light, and has clearer images.  Moon shots come out clear with craters sharply shown. Videos are very clear. This is not a technical review. Its a review for the semi-professional telling about the simplicity of use. It doesn't come with a printed manual, however a local print shop can run that off for you with the disk supplied. The manual is very complete and large, and a user should thoroughly learn all aspects of this camera to adequately be able to take good pictures. Yes its easier to use the auto features, however using the special features makes the great shots. I've taken quite a few thousand pics since my purchase, and really found 10% that should be discarded, usually through a failing on my part. Its a great camera for amateur or professional alike. Just be ready to learn how to use it to its full capabilities. All in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, and it seems I take out my SLR, less.After using the camera for another month or two, the review still stands. I've  finally started using the high speed action scene mode and it functions as indicated. Have taken up to 10 pics a sec. and almost all are fine. At long zoom you have to be careful to be steady for a sec. even with the IS on. The camera focuses with the 1st pic.and then holds that focus. Most of my high speed shots have been panning shots. Have not tried objects coming to or going away from the photographer.Will do that soon.

The zoom range while retaining image quality and camera user friendliness is unbelievable. The lens alone is worth the price. The surprise that got me (and I thought I knew everything!) was the value of the electronic viewfinder (EVF). While not the highest resolution and a bit tricky to center your eye on, the EVF allows easy shot confirmation without taking your eye away from it, zooming in to check sharpness and exposure, even in full sunlight where evaluating a washed out LCD image while composing or in playback would be difficult.  Of course there's always a trade-off - it's hardly a pocket camera. But carried in a light jacket pocket or a medium sized purse, you can still have near DSLR versatility with less weight and a smaller size.

For me, and this is a completely personal opinion is that lugging around that much stuff is NO fun 95 percent of the time. I finally decided to let go of the larger camera and move back to something that will get me out shooting again. After having this little guy for awhile I can tell you it has done just that. The manual that comes with it sucks. Only part is printed and the rest is on the cd rom. Just play around with the camera for 30 minutes and you will have it figured out on your own. Each setting lets you know what it does which is a great little tool when setting up your camera.Some of the Positives for this camera:Super zoom - when I had my dslr rig I would have needed to carry at least 3 other lenses to get this range. Not to mention there is no affordable method to get you out to 850mm on a dslr!Macro - on the completely opposite side you can get very very close up and personal with things. Add to that the filter attachment and a raynox 250 and you got a pretty sweet macro.Swivel screen - Unlike most of the others Canon has a screen that can swivel around and not just up and down like a few others.Ease of use - Once you learn how to access the features it is so fast and easy to get back in and adjust them on the fly.Movies - Excellent quality videos with the ability to do some high speed stuff makes video fun on this. Just note that if you do high speed video you quality will drop down. It was something I didn't see before purchasing the camera.Image Quality - Viewing these images at 50 percent I can not tell much difference from a dslr. Above that and I can start to see changes. It states a 16x20 can be printed but I would not believe that. Perhaps on ideal settings you might be able to get a 13x19 that looks good but I have not tried it yet. Pixel peeps and people with not much else to do but analyze might find more but I'm just not obsessed with that. If you are that person, you are looking at the wrong camera.Stabilization - It works, it works and it works wonderfully. At 800mm I can get a nice sharp image, that is pretty amazing to me.Cons or things I'd like to see changed -Screen resolution - Compared to others the screen on the back in pretty dated. Personally I like to see histograms and focus points more so I'm not too worried about it. But do know it isn't the best out there. Hopefully in the next version Canon will update it.Auto assist Green light - It is on by default in video and makes for some pretty silly lights on your subject. I think it should be off on video by default.lens cap - Gotta put on and take off a cap. Wouldn't be so bad if the cap wasn't so little bitty. Either beef up the cap or find a way to do away with it.no raw - I'm adding this to Cons since most people want it. Personally I could care less. I love the fact that my file sizes are smaller. I can still get in ACR in lightroom or photoshop if I want. And there is always the Canon mode that lets you install RAW if you really have to have it. I'd rather be shooting than editing though.Overall I'm happy with my new camera and don't regret the move one bit.

A pocket camera or cell phone camera can work for a lot of pics, but when you want a camera that is more robust than pocket size but not as cumbersome as a full size DSLR the Canon Powershot SX40 is perfect.I originally owned the SX30 and loved it. I just bought the SX40 to take along on a recent trip to Costa Rica (check my images on the main product page). This camera was PERFECT; large enough to be steady in my hands, the adjustable screen allowed for overhead or self pics, the video feature was great... but what I really bought it for was the ZOOM. Nothing comes close to what this camera can do in terms of zoom at this price point - again see my zoom comparison pics on the product main page.The main reason I upgraded was of the improved burst mode over the SX30 and a few more minor tweaks and better low light and focusing performance.The only thing I don't like is the lack of RAW images. But, for most people that is not an issue. I'd also like a more automatic way of composing HDR photos.Amateurs will love the full auto function and people with a bit more knowledge can find success with the manual controls.Buy with confidence!PS: Get good quality SD cards to use with this camera, especially if you're going to record video.

My primary objectives for it has been to obtain quality digital photos of birds and close-ups of wildflowers. The SX40 has excelled with both objectives. The features have allowed me to photo distant birds at maximum zoom and I obtain a clear focus image that can be edit,cropped, and enlarged. The stabilizing features of the SX40 are outstanding. At maximum zoom I give the auto focus features a few seconds to find the target and bingo a great shot. I can take over twenty shots of the subject in less than five seconds. With quick selection of macro zoom for close-ups I can capture a close image of the smallest flowers with the lens nearly touching the petals. This is an easy to use, high quality camera packed with features designed for digital photography. My only complaint involves the position of a display image button, which I often accidently engage and this results in shut-down of the lens. I'm getting over 300 photos on the battery before it needs to be recharged. I wish it had a setting for manual open of the lens for night lightning shots.

We currently own a basic point and shoot camera, so we were looking to upgrade.  Neither of us is a photo enthusiast or knows anything about photography or camera settings.  We were just looking for a good camera that would take really nice pictures.  Mission accomplished.  After doing a ton of research online, consulting with knowledgeable friends, and finally visiting a local retailer, I decided to get this camera instead of a very comparable Nikon or a more expensive DSLR.  I'm sure this camera is fantastic for intermediate- to highly-skilled users, but it is PERFECT for noobs.  Set the thing to \"auto\" and fire away!  With that being said, I can't comment on all the features of the camera, since I just set it to auto :-).  However, one thing I can certainly comment on is the zoom.  \"Phenomenal\" doesn't describe it.  When I was at my local retailer, explaining to the guy what I was looking for (a nice camera that I don't want to mess with the settings, and a good zoom would a nice feature), he immediately steered me to this Canon.  This sucker has a 35x optical zoom, and up to 140x digital zoom.  When he explained that the DSLR I was looking at had a 1-2x zoom, and if I wanted to buy a $300 lens for it, that would get me 10x zoom.  And this Canon has 35x, and it is AMAZING.  Whenever I use the camera, I find myself taking pictures of things that I really don't care about, just so I can use the zoom and show off how utterly impressive it is.  Honestly, it's almost like using binoculars.  You can take great spy photos!  Just don't tell your neighbors.  Also takes really impressive HD video with very clear sound.  I've never really been interested in carrying around a camera and taking pictures, but this camera makes me want to!Anyways, it's an awesome camera, especially if you're someone like me - set it to auto, zoom to your heart's content, and take some really high quality photos.

From what I've read of other reviews, if you fall into these categories, especially the need for RAW, this camera may not be you.  But for me personally, this is the single best camera I've ever owned, and my first Canon after years of Sony Cybershot point and shoots.I chose this camera for a two month stay in Japan after doing weeks and weeks of research on different cameras and weighing the pros and cons of each, so here are my own pros and cons after about two months of working with this camera (still in Japan by the way as of this review :)Pros:1. The 35x optical zoom is absolutely divine.  Superior ability to retain focus and so good, you can practically double the SX40 as binoculars.  It's that amazing.  For someone who had an excellent zoom as his #1A priority in getting a camera (#1 was image quality), I could not be happier with this feature.  Even my friends who are following my photoblog of Japan on Facebook have commented that the various different zoom pictures I've posted has made them want this camera.2. Terrific image quality, even in outdoor pictures.  I say that because traditionally from my own experience and those of friends/family members, Sony tends to have better outdoor picture cameras and Canon tends to be much better indoors/low-lighting.  This camera excels even the best Sony cameras I've had at outdoor pictures, which impresses the heck out of me.  Indoor/low-light image quality, is, of course, still miles ahead of anyone else.3.  As far as I can tell, the battery life is quite good on these.  I'd still have a spare battery with you just in case, but they seem to hold up really well.4.  The image stabilization is fantastic, just fantastic.  Even when my hands are shaky as all get out, the SX40 does a superb job of correcting for that deficiency, more so than any other camera I've ever used.Cons:1.  The only drawback that bothers me is every once in a great while (like say, maybe once every 700 or so pictures), there will be what look to be dust specks on a picture.  I think someone else reported something similar on another review, only for them it happened a lot more frequently than with mine.  Hopefully that low occurrence rate holds up.2.  If you're looking for something you can just put in your pocket and go.. well no, that's not going to work.  You're going to need to carry this in a camera bag that it'll fit in.  Fortunately I have a bag it fits in that isn't much trouble at all to haul around, but I still got a cheap backup compact point and shoot (the Sony DSC-W690, which I've written a review for as well).Overall Verdict:I love this camera, and while I like to change/upgrade cameras every few years, this is so far and away the best, most easy to use, most enjoyable camera I've ever had, that it will be a very long time before I look to replace it.  Its stellar zoom, image quality, and ease of use all make it the perfect camera for my own personal needs and desires, and at a price that won't break the bank or require advanced understanding of manual features like an SLR.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the guy who wants it all in one package", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R2GCAP7FKZ3MIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started photography at twelve years old.

I used equivalent focal lengths from 24 to 1680 mm. I had no trouble getting sharp pictures under these conditions. I used it hand held. Hint, use the view finder and hold it steady not the LCD screen held out where it is not steady. That is okay for most shots but not long telephotos.

I like being able to go from wide angle or closeup pictures to extreme zoom (840mm equivalent in a film camera!) within a few seconds. I really like that I can attach filters to the lens, because that gives me more creative control. I like the option of a flash hotshoe, although at this moment I don't have any compatible flash assemblies. The proprietary battery seems to last a long time, and I have 2 backup batteries to use if it dies, so that's not a big deal either.

The control dial is very nice too and operates smoothly.

I had to use the \"P\" setting exclusively on the SX30IS to assure getting most shots, whereas the \"Auto\" setting on the SX40HS does a great job at setting the internal aperature, speed and ISO settings.The \"hand-held night shot\" is Ok, but I seem to have better success with the \"Low light\" setting.I'll be honest with you, I spent some time deciding if I really wanted to upgrade to the latest Canon SX40HS and trade-in my SX30IS, but, after having it for a week, it was an excellent decision.I really don't see any advantage, at least for my enjoyment of photography, to even think about another camera beyond the Canon SX40HS.As I gain more information on this camera, I'll add to my review.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just Excellent", "Author": "RTexasF", "ReviewID": "R1QO9TSBIB1PUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera exceeded my expectations and I am totally pleased with it.

It's definitely good to know all the settings, because just using \"auto\" isn't going to give you the best pictures. I have had this camera for about 6 months, and I'm still learning all the different options it has, and which settings to use in different lighting to give me the best pictures possible! One thing that I don't like about the video is that when you zoom in or out, you can hear it on the video when you download it onto your computer. Another thing that I wish were different about the camera is that it has a very small viewfinder and so it's hard to see your object very well. I just use the LCD screen instead of the viewfinder, and that works great!!It's bigger than the screen on the SX10, which I find to be an advantage. But these are very minor issues, and wouldn't stop me from buying the SX40. I really LOVE the camera!! It's just the one I need. I definitely recommend this to anyone that wants more than just a simple point-and-shoot, but doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a camera as good as an SLR.

I was very pleased with it. The zoom has helped me catch so many photos of wildlife that otherwise would be missed; it works well under so many settings. Up to now, I have not felt that the improvements on the SX-20 or SX-30 were sufficient to make me upgrade.  Why did I finally decide to upgrade?  The photos are stunning.  The color and clarity of the shots are very nice indeed!Of course, really  impressive is the mega-zoom lens, especially nice when I can't get as close as I want for one reason or another ... it really brings the subject to me. It's especially useful for wildlife and nature shots.  Battery life is good, and it is quite a bit faster than the SX-10 to start up and between shots.  The articulated screen is a real plus!  It enables you to take photos from all sorts of awkward, odd angles - even over your head - and still see your viewscreen clearly to compose your shot. Additionally, there is a pretty decent viewfinder for those times only a viewfinder will do. The camera's flash is adequate for typical uses (not at zoom...) and a standard external flash connection is built in, which is a real plus. Like the SX-10 it is a bit heavier and bulkier than other point and shoot cameras but it is surprisingly easy to hold, with a \"natural\" handle built into the design. Menu and controls are similar enough to the SX-10 without being confusing or intimidating: actually I think if you've used any Canon PowerShot, they will look familiar. I do know after a short period of time with the SX-40 that it's a great specialty camera, an exceptional value for what it can do, it can't be beat - I love this camera.  I am looking forward to continuing to grow in knowledge of photography through use of this camera.Update 7/13:  I have been using the camera for a while now and am very familiar with what it can do.  Although I kept my  SX10  because it has a few settings (a sunset setting which I like, some adjustability which is not available on the SX40 as noted elsewhere),  I find I never use it at all because the photos just cannot compare-color, zoom or clarity-wise with the SX40.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely love this camera", "Author": "Renee", "ReviewID": "R1CLGN57YKI619", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually purchased this camera because of the reviews and because I need something light weight that will \"do it all\" for an upcoming big trip.

I can now see clearly what I am shooting without wearing glasses. The Canon also zooms and refocuses nicely in video mode. Love at first sight, literally. I don't mind that the Canon won't fit in my pocket. It's still portable enough to take hiking, and the thrill of actually being able to compose pictures properly is compensation enough. Very good pictures, by the way.This camera has a lot of thoughtful little features that I wasn't expecting in a point-and-shoot. I'm not a sophisticated camera user so it was a pleasant surprise to find that the rotating LCD screen is useful when perching the camera on a window sill to shoot video, and the screen can also be rotated around to face inside to protect it when not in use.

Going from very wide angle (35mm equivalent of 24mm) to way long (840mm equivalent), it will take about any picture you have in mind including a simulated fish-eye mode.  The CMOS sensor is excellent at providing very low noise even at the highest ISO settings.  Colors are excellent and the auto white balance seems to work well.  One thing to note is that only the NB-10L battery will fit this camera.  Although mostly an upgrade from the SX30, changes include the use of a smaller battery than the SX30 uses.  The SX40 HS takes excellent HD video, but because I don't have a fast (class 6) memory card, I can only take HD video for about a minute before the camera has to stop and catch up with the data processing.  A faster SD card would cure this I'm sure.  The slow motion video is fun although the 240 fps setting is pretty low res.  The 120 fps uses 640 x 480 resolution which is better.One quibble is that there are too many buttons around where my right thumb goes and it's easy to push one inadvertently.

Obviously if you are a professional photographer your review will be much different than someone who has only used a compact digital camera and upgraded to this.  So, for the sake of context, my wife wanted a camera to turn on and take nice looking pictures.  I wanted a camera that offered some flexibility for the settings but nothing over the top becuase I am definitly not an advanced photographer.  The only cameras we had owned were compact digitals and our most recent one was purchased in 2010 so it was a couple years old.  We were not too pleased with the picture quality and decided to invest in a nicer camera.  After researching I decided a bridge camera would be good for us since we were not concerned with size.  I did not want a DSLR because of cost and the fact that we are rather inexperienced at photography.  So that is the context of my review.We purchased a Panasonic Lumix FZ47 and this Canon SX40 HS.  The Panasonic was nice and took good pictures but I felt like the auto setting was definitly not as good as the Canon.  The Panasonic had multiple settings for Portrait, Scenery, Sports, Night, etc so I felt like I was always playing with the setting to try and make the picture better.  The Canon I just turned it on auto and it took great pictures.  Even with not so great light it does pretty good.  So we kept this on shipped the Panasonic back.So, if you want a bridge camera for taking pictures on Auto mode, this camera is great.  It is such a huge step up from a compact digital that it will blow your mind.The negitives so far are pretty minor, like I wish the screen was 3.0 inches instead of 2.7 and the flash is somewhat awkward.  But those are minor things.I recommend this camera.UPDATE:A couple weeks later and still loving this camera.  Took the kids to a park the other day and took some amazing outdoor photos using the sports mode and auto mode.  It takes such good pictures on auto mode that I find myself not playing with the settings much.UPDATE:I have had this camara for about 6 months now.  Still love it.  We actually took our family pictures with it.  Just had my sister in law take a couple hundred photos of us and there were some really good ones in the bunch.

Yes, I can take technically better photographs with them - but only in limited circumstances! If I want a picture of a goldfinch at my feeder, this is the camera I grab!  The pictures this takes are so good, and the camera is SO versatile, it's just FUN!  I don't worry about changing lenses, changing settings, or getting tripods.  I can respond to almost any situation just by zooming and pressing the shutter button.  The DIGIC-V processor/HS sensor used in the camera really makes the most of the 35x zoom.  The images show remarkably little digital noise - almost to the quality of my first dSLR!  And the integral anti-shake image-stabilization makes that monster-zoom range entirely useful!  I took a photograph indoors at night with room lighting - no flash - at full-zoom.  That's the equivalent of an 840mm telephoto on an old 35mm film camera.  The SX40 HS used a shutter speed of 1/20 of a second with a film speed equivalent of 1250 - and it looked good.  No tripod.  No blur (at least, not on my computer screen).  I was ecstatic!  PLUS - the camera I got was still made in Japan (which I happen to find reassuring).  If you want RAW picture files (a common criticism of the Powershots, because they don't use them), you'll have to make up your own mind whether to splurge for one of the competition's models.  For me, if I need a RAW file, I need a dSLR to start with anyway.  However, if you're one of the vast majority of folks who hasn't a clue about the difference between a \"RAW\" file and a jpg file, don't worry about it - I'm confident you'll have all the camera you need to have all the fun you can imagine in this unit.

Never had any real problems with their cameras, but always felt they were just a little lacking in total features.  My current camera, a Kodak Z950, has done everything I had asked of it and I'm keeping it, but for those special occasions, I wanted to look for something more.  Also, I was a little concerned with Kodak's current Chapter 11 bankruptcy - their entire camera line is currently listed as \"discontinued\" and there is no word on if that line will return when the bankruptcy is discharged.I had been looking at Canons for a while (and I have recommended Canon to others in the past when their needs weren't met by Kodak units), and while I wasn't looking for a DSLR, I was looking for a capable super-zoom that did more than my Z950.  The PowerShot SX40 HS fit the bill in terms of specs, but I stayed on the sidelines for a while.  Then a clearance sale at Staples offered a price I couldn't pass up ($319), so I bought it in July.I ordered a SanDisk Extreme Pro 32 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 95MB/s SDSDXPA-032G-X46 here at Amazon, and started \"playing\".  Reading the full user manual PDF is a must if you're not used to Canon's controls and terminology, but they're easy to learn.  The Canon offers 16 sizes of images and 6 categories of video, so you'll always have the right resolution for the job.  You have a very thorough array of settings available - so you can just let the camera choose the aperture/shutter/ISO, or you can choose them as you wish.The lens is exceptional for some of those rare shots.  I was able to zoom in on the August 31 blue moon from my deck and get not only a clear detailed shot, but actual moon craters in the image.  My Z950 would have gotten just a glowing white globe in the night sky.  The low-light settings are terrific; I was able to actually take clear images at a friend's backyard party at night with no flash at all.  The super-slo-mo video settings work beautifully (both 120 and 240 fps) and play back as intended on my computer, as well as on-camera.  Looking forward to using the SX40 at upcoming events like my high school reunion.Bottom line:  the Canon PowerShot SX40 HS is an excellent choice in between point-and-shoot digitals and DSLRs.

I wish I could post it for you to see.For me, seeing this beautiful little bird, no bigger than my thumb, so close, is absolutely AWESOME.Oh yes, BTW, this camera takes movies also...but I was, and still am, only interested in the picture taking aspect of the camera.

Taking pictures at 35x zoom without a tripod was amazing! They turned out a little better if I braced the camera on a ledge but I don't feel a need for a tripod with this camera except for using the timer function. What a great image stabilizing system!Swiss-army knife lens--This lens does it all with such a zoom range. I did not take any pictures of brick walls to check clarity of the image periphery (nor would I ever do that) but just having that zoom range in a single lens is really nice. I'm willing to sacrifice a little in image quality for that incredible convenience and economy over having different lenses to swap out.AV mode--I only use the full auto and AV modes. AV mode is where you select F-number and let the camera do the rest; this is very easy to do on this camera with a dedicated dial. I sometimes change the ISO number in AV mode too and unfortunately this does not have a dedicated wheel but is selectable after a single button push at least.Cons:Image delay in the viewfinder--The viewfinder has an electronic screen in it unlike a DSLR which lets you see a true optical image in the viewfinder; this is part of what makes this camera more inexpensive over a DSLR I think but it is also what makes it slightly annoying to use. The upside to this system is you can somewhat see things like exposure and depth of field instantly when looking into the viewfinder, though these cannot be seen with precision of course due to the small image you're looking at. I would prefer a DSLR that allows you to see a true optical image with depth of field preview, but the HS40 system amounts to a tradeoff that one can partially acclimate to in my opinion.Summary: I would recommend this camera overall for overall value and ease of use.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quality versatile camera", "Author": "Douga", "ReviewID": "R1BPDBSXTGWZ2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is excellent for someone who doesn't want to change lenses or pack heavy photographic equipment.

I liked my Sony but after 30,000 shots and dropping it a few times, it was starting to show it's wear by not recognizing some of my settings.The Canon SX40 made my wish list after playing around with it at Best Buy.  I especially liked the effects options and the impressive zoom.  I could not find any really good examples of these features in other reviews so here goes.Overall, this camera takes great photos.  I prefered using P mode vs automatic because of the additional features availble in this setting.  It's just like using Auto but with many more tools.The main reason for my review is to provide insights on other features for those that have already determined that the camera is pretty good based on other reviews.Zoom - it does what the mfr features say. At maximum zoom it is very hard to hold steady, even by using a solid base such as a rail or tripod.  There is a very useful button called the Zoom assist which you hold down so you can locate your subject again.  I ended up backing off on zoom and relying on cropping to get the final result I was looking for.  (I finally discovered in an obscure section of the manual that digital zoom can only be used in 4:3 or 16:9 mode)Color Accent - I liked this feature when it was first introduced on earlier models.  I took it to a Laker game and the only real issue is that it has trouble recognizing purple.  You'll see from my posted samples that Laker purple looks more like blue.  There's no way to change white balance in this mode.  But it's a neat gimmicky feature that is still fun to use.Fish Eye - I like the options.  You have 3 degrees to choose from.  I like the highest level to really get some cool images.Miniature Effect - This was tough to figure out. Mostly because I wasn't sure why anyone would use it.  But I did find that for wider shots, and when there are many subjects in a plane (such as on a basketball court), it can provide an interesting perspective.  See my posted example.Fast Shutter - My Sony HX1 has a way to adjust the speed of fast shutter.  You can choose low, medium, and high.  You only get up to 10 shots in a burst.  But you have to wait until it saves all of them before you can shoot again. This can take up to 17 seconds.  I found that the Canon has only one basic default speed (there is a high speed burst mode in the creative filters mode, but you don't get to keep some of the settings you have in M, P, T or A mode).  But I accidentally discovered that I didn't have to wait for all the shots to be saved if I pressed halfway down on the shutter.  And there's no limit to the number of shots.  Just hold down the shutter until your done.I want to point out that I used Picasa to create collages of various photos so that you can see 3 or 4 shots in one frame.  Even though this meant some cropping, I hope you'll find these helpful in determining if this camera's other lesser discussed features make it a good choice for you.I like this camera - a lot.  I do think that most users will also enjoy using this as you learn each of the features.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good all around Mom camera", "Author": "Colliemo \"reading fan\"", "ReviewID": "R1CYOV7M3A8HYE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a couple of months now and have been trying it out in a lot of different situations.  Although I haven't mastered when to use what setting, I am very pleased with the purchase.  Auto works well in most situations.  I had canon cameras before, then moved to the Nikon 8100 trying to find a good point & shoot for photos of  my son playing sports.  The Nikon worked well outside in bright light but was abysmal for indoor functions.  I considered a DSLR but didn't want to carry all the equipment or pay so much for a family camera.  So far I've used the SX40 for backyard nature pix, family photos, trips to the zoo & the circus as well as other museum excursions.  It has worked quite well.  Although I took a couple of photography classes years ago, my memory of ISO & other photo terms is fuzzy to say the least, so I have been just trying different settings and looking through the instruction book on disk when I have time.Somehow I turned off the digital zoom when the camera first arrived, so I wasn't sure why everyone was so enthralled with the zoom.  It was good but not spectacular.  Once I got the digital back on I see what the fuss was all about.The camera is a bit large to tuck into a handbag, and I got a neoprene cover to protect it without a bulky bag, but it is a lot less to carry around than a DSLR.

Also, my current telephoto is a 75-300mm and would be underpowered absent a 2x magnifier. In any event,I expected a megazoom lense,but was quite concerned about image quality of a non-slr... just a hazy point and shoot.

A long time agoI had a Pentax SLR, the old film kind but have not done any photography since, untilnow. I did not want to have to mess with different lenses either so after someresearch online I decided on this camera, being the best mix of what I wanted in a camera andwhat I could afford.I am impressed!!  I know it does not do RAW, and you cant really put filters on the frontand it has some other issues with not being able to go manual for a few things and it could be a bit faster and better here and there,BUT it does take some kickin' nice photos!! and I LOVE the zoom. For me its fairly quick to pull out ofthe bag and start up if I see some critter I have to snap on the fly. It has been easy to work with and I have been really having fun and getting some great shots!!. I find that the battery charges pretty quick and lasts a fair while. I will probably get a second battery though, just to have a fresh one handy.  I think for the money it is an excellent camera and unless you require RAW data, or have a lot more funds available for something more professional you cant go wrong with this camera.10/7/2012 UPDATE  Still enjoying the camera.  I had taken awesome(for me) pictures of the \"Blue\" moon we had on August 31st. unfortunately positioning the camera in the grass and everything else took some patience and just rightness.  There are some limitations on the selections in full manual, I could not select an F11(as recommended on a website 'how to photograph the moon\"). I just had to pick the widest f-stop available and set the shutter speed to turtle, but not too slow since the moon is a moving object. Anyhow the photos are never the less very cool. My first celestial photos!!  I am now trying to get a picture of my favorite constellation, Orion!!  but I need a real tripod, so I'm searching around.One thing I will say is, if you put a filter on the front or an adapter ring to accommodate a larger filter, be careful when threading it on(others have mentioned this).  I put my adapter ring on and it is slightly crooked and I cant seem to budge it with out using some force, so I have just left it for now. I plan to take to a camera shop to see if they can find a safe way to dislodge it.  but it is not interfering with my photo taking just annoying knowing its not exactly straight. grrr.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon sx40.

For the past few years I have bought a new Canon high-end point & shoot (Like the SX30 or SX40) every year. Amazon normally has a decent discount around Thanksgiving. I keep all the original packaging & accessories from my old camera, take some really nice pics & can usually sell it on eBay around Christmas for about 15% less than I paid for it.  That way I can stay with the latest model and amortize the replacement cost of a new camera over about 5 - 6 years which I figure is about the life of the camera anyway.Now onto the camera ...........If you have an SX30 or earlier model, TRADE UP!  Three main reasons I'm sold on this model are:1) CMOS sensor - Although Canon downgraded this new model to 12 mp from 14mp on the SX30, the reduced noise on the SX40 is very evident if you do any extreme crops.2) Burst mode - In the last couple years we did an Alaska cruise and went to Sea World in San Diego.  I got a few nice shots of whales & porposes jumping - by dumb luck.  I had to try and judge when to shoot.  Tons of missed shots.  Wish I had the burst mode for these shooting conditions.3) Tracking face detection works great!I have not taken any night photos in years so the low light limitations a few people mentioned are not an issue with me.I have thought many times about upgrading to a DSLR to get some additional features.  I've always decided not to as I've found over the years (I'm retirement age) that I hated lugging multiple lenses, etc.  The addition of the CMOS sensor and burst mode has brought this camera very close, in my humble opinion, to a DSLR.  Plus the 35X optical zoom.  It would be hard to part with these features in this compact package & go to a DSLR.  I have to admit that I may look at the Sony Alpha Nex-7 when it hits the market - a compact DSLR with interchangeable lenses & 24mp.  Yum!  $1200 for the body & $800 for an 18-200mm zoom?  Well, on second thought ...............On March 28, 2012 I'll be adding a photo of a raptor (Cooper's hawk?) that I took from what I would guess would be around 200-300 feet & hand held.

The slow motion camera is a huge plus as it allows for everyday events that normally seem boring, to be slowed down into an epic show every single time. For video, you must have very good lighting and it will come out crystal clear. This was basically the first camera i ever picked up and i learned how to use all the features in a couple days.

nothing but \"true\" SLR cameras.  There were no such thing as \"digital\" SLR cameras, all my cameras were 100% \"manual\".  You needed to rely on your own skill and creativity.  Now days computer software can make anyone look like a \"professional\".  To this day I still have all my 35mm and portrait cameras, as well as my darkroom equipment.  In my time of doing photography, mistakes were costly when using film.  Not like today's cameras were if you make a mistake you delete the the picture and start over.  My darkroom equipment has given way to computer darkrooms.  Today's camera's with their built in computers, ( both Point & shoot, and SLR ) have become great at forgiving the photographer of it's mistakes.  With film cameras you had to live with the mistakes you made.  An example with film cameras, is that you would have to do a lot of \"bracketing\" to make sure you got the right exposure.  Nowadays its all done with computer software.  Today's \"SLR\" cameras are not \"true\" SLR cameras.  Even though your still looking through the lens they still rely on an on board computer.  In the days of film SLR cameras they were strictly manual and 100% mechanical.  In my days of photography it was the photographer who made the camera take \"professional\" photos, now its the computerized camera that's in control.Due to being paralyzed I cannot use an SLR camera anymore, although I would love to if i could.  Now I have to use a \"point and shoot\" such as the Canon Power Shot SX40 HS.  I guess I just miss the good ol' days of using the \"true SLR\" cameras.  I agree that SLR cameras are the way to to go.  Modern cameras, thanks to modern age of built in computers, turn out really great pictures that you could only dream of getting with using film.  Even though I have to use a point and shoot camera I agree with most of the reviewers, I find that Canon Power Shot SX40 HS is a great camera for what it is designed for.  I am not trying to be bias toward Canon because I have both Nikon and Canon professional \"SLR Film\" cameras.  I also have a Hasselblad and Mamiya portrait cameras.  Unfortunately they are now in my closet collecting dust.  Over all the main reason I have the SX40 HS is not because its made by Canon, but because of what it can do and how easy it is to use even a paralyzed person can use it with great ease and results.  Just one last thing, even though I am bias toward the \"SLR's\" in general ( mainly the true or \"real\" SLR film cameras ), I believe comparing \"Point & Shoot\" with \"SLR\" cameras is like comparing apples with oranges.  They both have have there own nitch in the world of today's cameras.AS A \"POINT AND SHOOT\" CAMERA, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SX40 HS.P.S. I really like the great zoom of the SX40 HS.

thought. I updated my review to reflect this.UPDATE 4/9/12: Added video to demonstrate macro glitch I mention in my review. Do all SX40's behave this way or just mine?...I'm an enthusiast who wants control, but doesn't want to lug around a system anymore. I have a Panasonic G2, but I still prefer the convenience of a \"do-it-all\" bridge camera for most situations. My last bridge camera was a Canon S3-IS. I've been tempted by newer models since then, but nothing seemed worth upgrading to until they started using CMOS sensors.My search boiled down to the Canon SX40HS & Panasonic FZ150. After pouring over the reviews, I chose the FZ150 because it was geared more to enthusiasts. But before I could buy it, I found a deal on the SX40, so here I am. (Note: The price of the SX40 & FZ150 were only about $20 apart before Christmas). The SX40 has many reviews (which are fairly accurate), so I'll try not to repeat too much. Here's a summary of what matters to me:PROS: 35x zoom lens w/ image stabilization. Image quality (12 MP CMOS) very good, but JPG compression needs improvement. Articulated LCD screen (a must-have for me now). Slow motion video. \"Zoom Framing Assist\" button.CONS: JPG quality rather low (details below). Macro virtually useless (details below). Button layout needs work; I often accidentally turn it on by pushing the play button when I grasp the camera. The rotating donut wheel is horrible - I'm always activating the cursor buttons when spinning it during manual focus. A thumb-wheel like the FZ150 & dSLRs is much better. That and the relatively low-res LCDs make manual focusing difficult at best. Camera feels a little cheap.IMAGE QUALITY: Better than my old S3-IS (6mp CCD); much closer to the M4/3 quality of the G2 (12mp CMOS). See my customer image posted 3/19/12. There's more noise and JPG artifacts & detail loss than the G2 when you zoom into pixel level, but it's still good for such a small sensor. However, there are some situations where the artifacts are fairly pronounced. I just shot some distant boats on a lake and I was less than happy with the JPG quality. See my customer image posted 5/20/12.MACRO: At first I thought it was defective because I kept getting green \"focus locked\" boxes when the image was obviously out of focus. I even got a Class 10 card as one review suggested. There are two problems when shooting close-ups: 1) I get lots of false positive (green) focus locked boxes, and 2) The macro range is virtually useless. However, you can still get some pretty decent close focus shots once you learn the limitations of the camera. The key is to be aware of the bar scale that appears in the upper left as you zoom - that shows the focusing limits through the zoom range. Make sure you are within the range before believing the green focus lock signal. Second, the actual \"macro mode\" is virtually useless. The only time setting it to macro mode gains you anything is when you are zoomed out to full wide angle and shooting closer than 1.9\". All other minimum focusing distances (through the zoom range) are the same in or out of macro. Unfortunately, using a 24mm macro lens closer than 1.9\" is awkward at best because shadows keep getting in the way and the front of the lens starts hitting things. NOTE: See my video review that tries to sum all of that up.SIZE: I'm pretty particular when it comes to size. I don't like too big or too small - it has to feel right (I still judge size by my old Nikon FM-2, and dSLRs feel too fat to me). Granted this is highly personal, but the SX40 \"feels right\".VIEWFINDER: It's a tad small and low-res (202k), but useable. Mine has a yellowish tinge. It's better than the S3-IS (115k), but nowhere near the quality of the G2 (1,440k).FLUFF: \"Toy camera mode\"? Do people really use that? I wouldn't miss it if they took \"Creative Filters\" off the dial. That's what Photoshop is for.WISH LIST: RAW format, screw on filters, better manual control, higher res LCD & Electronic ViewFinder, and make smaller & prettier (see FZ150 :-). Oh, and AA batteries instead of proprietary.NOTE ON RAW: I don't want RAW for all shots, but it's great to have when you want to squeeze every detail out of that special photo. I shoot at -2/3rds of a stop and blown-out highlights are still common.MY BIASES: I show my pictures on TVs & computers now and you don't need lots of resolution for that (even HD is only 2.1 megapixels). My old S3-IS still makes a great video slideshow and the SX40's zoom & resolution give me a LOT more detail to crop from. I'm also anti-dSLR - too much bulk for what you gain. I'll take a good LCD / EVF over a mirror & pentaprism any day (which is why I chose M4/3 over dSLR). I think LCD's strengths (in dim light, information, digital tools, etc.) outweigh their weaknesses (in bright light, refresh rate, etc.). That said, the SX40's LCDs need some improvement.SUMMARY: The SX40HS is an excellent bridge camera - automatic enough for beginners with adequate control for enthusiasts. The \"killer app\" is the 35x zoom lens w/ image stabilization; otherwise it's just OK. Image quality is much better than CCD and even reasonably close to 12mp larger sensor cameras, but the JPG compression needs improvement. I am very happy with my choice, but I still wish I had the FZ150 too.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely the best camera I've ever had.....", "Author": "Gene M.

I teach science, so I use some of my photos in the classroom. The most important aspect of any camera, in my opinion, is its ability to produce clear, sharply detailed images.  I am not attracted by all the special effects and bells and whistles-----if the camera can't make a good photo, I don't want it.  For quite a few years I have been using a couple of Fuji cameras and have been very happy with the results.  Lately I have wanted a camera with a long zoom but could not afford to go to a DSLR.  I tried one of the Fuji long zoom cameras but was not happy with the results (the photos were soft).  Then I began to research the Canon SX40 HS and after months of consideration, and when the price became right, purchased the camera.  It arrived in just a few days and after charging the included battery(it does not take long to charge the battery), I began taking photos.  I was extremely happy from the beginning and after a month of taking photos I am still extremely happy.  The photos, even at long zoom, are really clear and sharp.  I am also pleased with the overall construction and weight of the camera.  It feels well-made, not cheap and plasticky. And, yes, even though it isn't the most important thing to me, I have played with some of the special functions and they are pretty neat.  I have not tried out the video yet.  There are a few things to consider.  It is important, really important, to take the time to read the instruction manual which is on a CD included with the camera, because you need to know how to change the settings and what the camera is capable of.  If the camera doesn't do what you want it to, its your fault for not reading the instructions.  Second, unless you are really steady-handed (which I am not) you will need a tripod for the long zoom.  I used a tripod and took photos of the moon with full zoom and they turned out great----the detail of the craters was fantastic. You might want to get a different neck strap, the one that comes with the camera is kind of stiff and not user friendly.

Easy to operate and learn its functions. It does not come with a printed manual (the manual is on the included CD) and this did not work for me as I am one who requires a good old fashioned printed manual.

I knew what I wanted on the next camara. High zoom, at least double more pixels, viewfinder, great macro, HD video, better than a point and shoot but not quite a DSLR. I don't want to mess with a bunch of to expensive to afford lenses.  Started doing some research. Got very overwhelmed at first. It had been awhile since I really took a look at camaras. I wanted to make the right choice in one because this is a purchase that had to last for a time. I read alot of reviews and then got more overwhelmed because once I made a decision I would read a contradictory review on it. So then I became frustrated and wondered if there was a camara made that professionals could agree on and that consumers loved.  After a couple of weeks I narrowed down to three. And after reading the feedbacks here and researching the web for those \"professional\" reviews I decided on the SX40 HS. So off to Sears to handle the item. Came home and ordered. Had it in a week.  I have not been let down or dissapointed in this thing. It does as everyone says. One thing that I did have to let go in my \"wants in a camara\" was the AA's. I just ordered a two battery, charger kit here. It can charge them in the car so I can always have batteries ready. If it used the AA's the camara would be to heavy. As it is now it is about the same weight as my sisters DSLR was. Feels like it when handling it too.  Zoom is awesome. Digital zoom is a bit grainy/fuzzy at times. But that's digital for you. When taking picture of the moon it doesn't do it. Why? Don't know. But I zoom in and the full moon can't all fit in the photo and I expect someone to wave back at me. Macro hasn't let me down. I do need to add here though that focus is a bit to get use to. But be patient and let it do it's thing. Hold shutter half down to focus. Let it focus then snap and you'll get a great photo everytime.  The special effects are cool to have. The fisheye was a surprise to see. I love the black and white with your chosen color. And the toy camara I use often. This is loaded with a ton of features that you can't get bored with. Also this can splice photos together! Many people I see are looking for that feature. Along with bridging. Way to many things to get into here. But alot of camara for your money.  The flip LCD was another surprise and I had only seen it come out on the higher end camaras. I usually use my viewfinder so it's turned in to protect the screen (I am getting screen protectors). But I find myself taking advantage of it's capability to turn out and twist up or down. I have been using that feature to get our baby robins pictures. There is a nest over our porch light. I simply open it, turn it down towards me as I am holding camara up. Zoom a little hold shutter to focus and snap away.  You get a CD for you computer. Load it on it as you can't views photos without it. There is a small starter manual to get you going. But hey Canon, get real. It would be nice to get a whole book featuring all the functions of the camara. It least make one available to buy! Even though I found this SX easy to use right out of the box (easier than my Sony but still think it's an awesome camara). But to get to know all the functions it would be nice. Who wants to carry their computer around to look something up?  All in all. You can't go wrong. You are getting a heck of a camara! BUT, learn to use it.

I do a lot of amateur photography.  I shoot everything from landscapes, astrophotos, to extreme macro.  You'll be amazed at how this camera performs.The only things I would change about this camera:1.  The on button location is such that you could mistakenly turn the camera off when trying to take a picture.  The new Canon SX50 corrects this.2.  The camera does not record in RAW mode.  The new Canon SX50 corrects this.3.  My biggest pet peeve:  When the camera is in manual mode, sometimes the camera will override my ISO setting.  This is NOT corrected by the SX50.I briefly thought of upgrading to the SX50, however when the camera is used at 35x, holding the camera still enough without a tripod can be daunting, even with Canon's excellent image stabilization.  50X would surely require a tripod, which I'm not willing to schlep through the woods.My solution to the automatic ISO problem and RAW mode was to download and use the non-modifying firmware CHDK, a software hack that makes no changes to the built-in Canon programming.  This is obtained online, free for the downloading.The camera is rather bulky since it houses the magnificent Canon telephoto lens.  The lens uses fluorite glass, an exotic glass that has wonderful chromatic correction.  As a rule, I don't use flash when photographing, preferring natural lighting, even at night.  The CMOS chip is very sensitive, capturing great detail, and natural color, even with night scenes.  I've never used the camera's preset scene modes, preferring to photograph in manual mode.  I've found that the CMOS is so sensitive, that I generally set the white balance to the negative.Given the enormous telephoto lens, the camera is well balanced and light weight, but well built.  The lens moves smoothly when adjusting for telephoto.  The lens can be used in conjunction with 2.5x digital zoom, bring the total telephoto capability to 140x.  As a purist, I keep the digital zoom off.As you increase the ISO values, there is increased noise at you approach ISO 3200; the CMOS sensitivity is such that I've never had to set the ISO this high, even in dark photography.  The colors produced by the camera are very true to life; as a rule, I only adjust my photographs for light, never color.The camera's macro capability is from 0 cm; if you're doing very close macro photography with the camera, make sure the lens does not touch your subject!  The lens will focus at 0 cmWhen taking action shots, (sports mode), it will record at ~2.5 frames per second, which is fast enough to catch most action.As they say, pictures are worth a 1000 words, so I've added pictures taken with the SX40.  There is no magic here (other than the camera).  I use Photoshop Elements to process the pictures, but other than cropping and correcting the lighting for highlights and shadows, these photographs are as taken.  The colors are as photographed, NEVER adjusted.In the year I've owned the camera, I've taken almost 3000 photographs.Make sure you buy a class 10, high speed card for this camera to use it to it's maximum.  The camera supports Eye Fi cards, but I haven't tried this feature.My recommendation: if you want to do photography that looks professional and comparable to a really good DSLR, don't hesitate to buy this camera, or the new SX50!To see some of what this camera is capable of please visit my photos on flicker:  [...]", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Dream Come True", "Author": "David P.", "ReviewID": "R3JTIGXRPEAD3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SLR cameras are great, but the cost of the cameras and those extremely expensive lens to drag around has, up to now, had me using the Canon SD990 IS pocket model for the last several years.  Then Canon introduced the SX series.  It truly is a dream come true.  A fixed body with the ability to shoot wide angle to 35x optical zoom and beyond with extremely high quality images is amazing.  Further, the viewfinder is truly impressive (I NEVER open the LCD screen which saves a lot on the juice).  If you wear glasses, take them off and adjust the viewfinder to your eyes.  It is so easy to see what you are shooting and you can see your menu settings as  well as with the screen.Gone are the days of missing shots because in the bright sunlight you can't see the screen.  Then there is the 1080i HD video with Dolby surround sound (two mics).  This camera is much more than a point and shoot.

Low light performance was good, and I got several great shots of the night life by setting the camera down and triggering the shutter.A couple of hints:1. Buy a spare battery when you buy the camera - it costs a bit over 10 bucks but is well worth it. Using the flash and lots of zooming and focusing meant I only got a couple of hundred shots and some videos before the icon started blinking, but the spare battery and charger easily fit into the camera case I bought.2.

The exposure is set by the first shot, ensuring the shots will match better when merged into a panorama with the included software.So far I am very pleased with the quality of pictures I've been able to take.

I love to take fotos and will use the camera for family shots, vacations, and memorie making. I shopped for a 'bridge' camera for 6 months!  The main items I was looking for were  a long zoom, a viewfinder, and ability to attach a filter.  I researched and debated between this camera and the Sony DSC-HX100.  My last 2 cameras were Sonys and I had been happy, but decided to be open minded and do the research.  I wanted a step up from the pocket models but did not want to go back to dealing with carrying and changing lens'. In the end, the reason I chose this camera over the Sony was #1 cost, I could not see paying an extra $75 for the Sony , and the accessories were also more costly and #2, years ago I had a Canon AE1-and was happy with it, and well, Canon makes cameras-so I deceded to give it a try and go back to Canon.  I was happy I did.I took the camera with us on a cruise, and well, so far so very happy!!  Downloading the 200+ pages of the owners manual was a headache, wish they had included one, but you will need it!!  I have not even begun to 'touch' on what this camera is capable of doing and did not do any movies.  But, here are the points I have been happy with / and or not so happy with;-It is a little heavy, from what I am used to, and I am not yet comfortable with the 'grip' .  My hand keeps 'bumping' the knobs and \"things' happen-the night setting (in the SCN) works fantastic...with no flash, the low lighting works great-good image stabilization, not too many blurry fotos-the macro has been hard for me to 'figure out', but like I said, the manual is huge...so I have not yet been comfortable and happy with the macro fotos I have taken of flowers-the SPORTS setting for movement, appears to go slower than my Sony used to.  When you hold the button down, there seems to be a bit fo a lag-the flash is not strong.  I do like that you must manually raise or lowere, because I loke to be in control.  I may look at adding an external flash in the future...which you can do on this camera-I played with the color settings, as in b/w, sepia, vivid, etc.  these setting worked really well-I bought the filter adapter--do this!  Especially, if you plan on  beaqch scens, being able to attach a ppolarizing filter is a 'must'.  the adpater attached easily, once you took a minute to learn to do it correctly.  The negative is that the lens cap does not fit on with the adapter-\"Trimming\" works well in blowing up just a face in a foto...I have not played with any of the computer accesories yet, but within the camera, I am happyOverall, in the end, I am happy with the camera.  I am saying 'wow' more than I am saying \"I regret\"....Value for price paid-very good.  Amazon and the other sellers I bought from, performedf and delivered as they said.  I did purchase the Amazon company warranty, but hopefully will not have the need to review it!!

I have received numerous compliments on my pictures and I am just an amatuer photographer.PROS: - Easy to use.  With animals in the bush country you often have just seconds to get your shot.  With this camera I never missed an opportunity. - Takes great pictures.  It focuses quickly and adjusts for light automatically and quickly.  I took pictures while standing in the noonday equitorial sun while my subject was in the deep shade and the camera knew exactly what to do. - 35x power lens is great.  I took fantastic close-ups of animals that I could barely see with my naked eye.  At full extension, the lens is hard to hold steady but sitting the camera on a beanbag solves this. - Also takes great videos.  I had never used a video camera before, but with just the push of a button this camera records action. - Good image stabilization.  I took a number of pictures as our 4x4 sped down very bumpy roads and most of them turned out sharp. - Robust.  The African heat, dust and terrible roads never bothered this camera.CONS: - No camera bag.  I couldn't find a decent bag to fit this camera.  I ended up carrying it in my backpack and this worked fine. - Shutter speed can be a little slow, especially if you are trying to capture moving objects.

The 35X optical zoom allows you to stand fairly far off from a subject and still get excellent close images, useful when the situation doesn't allow you to get as close as you'd need to with a P&S;, or an DSLR without a very long lens. It does have some creative limitations, but it's not a DSLR and doesn't pretend to be. The image stabilization allows clear hand held shots at very low light situations. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the images I got of a full moon with the lens zoomed all the way in (into the digital zoom range) details of the moon's surface are clear, hand held. It's not a substitute for a DSLR, but it's a huge step up from a P&S.; It's light and compact, so you can carry it around all day without noticing it. When you buy it, be sure to get the filter adaptor and a UV filter (they're much cheaper online than at your local camera shop), you need the adaptor in order to use filters on this camera, they do not just screw on to the lens barrel.

Pics are usually remarkably free of blur.  Colors are good.  IQ is good.  IS is good.  (Overall, good picture quality and average video/audio.)I love Canon.

The screen is 460,000 not an outdated 230,000 and a bit larger.  Battery life is somewhat better.  OIS is even better than that on the SX40.  It has RAW.

If you're new to the hobby and want a good camera to get started, this is it!The only con I have is that if you have too many pictures on the memory card, you have to buy a USB device to transfer images directly from the memory card.  You can't do it from the camera.

And it has so many simple to use adjustments that it can make an amateur's photographs look like the work of professionals.  It's really a modern miracle.A modern miracle, yes, but not perfect:(1) It doesn't have a hot shoe.  This means no auxiliary flash for more lighting power or bounce flash lighting effects.  In this price range I think it should have a hot shoe.  The SX20 does.(2) The zoom control is in the same spot as the shutter release.  This makes it almost impossible to get really good close-up fast action shots.  (With my Canon Rebels I zoom the lens constantly with my left hand as I press the shutter release with my right hand). Then, with the setting on \"Sports,\" and  the shutter set on rapid bursts, I can often get great shots at the local dog park.  But those dogs do move  fast.  The SX40 simply takes more skill to work this fast.  When it comes to speed a younger person can always do better than me.(3) While my SX20 came with a nice lens shade, the SX40 does not.  (Is Canon trying to cut costs?)(4) The SX40, like the SX20, does not record photographs in RAW format - only JPEG.  This is an amateur point and shoot camera.  Most of these types can't shoot RAW, but some in this price range do.  But most stores that make prints can only use JPRG as RAW formats need to be edited on a computer.(5) Also, like the SX20, a special adapter must be purchased in order to use an Ultraviolet, Polarizer, or other filters.NOTE: Excellent accessories, like spare batteries, lens hood, adapters, etc., can always be found at a fraction of the Canon price.The Canon SX40 is a great amateur camera with some aspects that could be useful to professionals.  Any professional lens that extends to this length and when fully extended has a maximum aperture of f5.6, would weigh a ton and cost a fortune.  The new SX50 telephoto zoom is even greater than the SX40, but right now it cost $400.00 on Amazon.  Actually, I don't think I would want it.  Enough is enough.With my Canon Pro9000 printer I have made good prints up to 16X20\" with the SX40.  And I can radically crop (trim) pictures to change the format as desired.  I can do this with confidence with the SX40 set on ISO100 - 800.  Higher ISO settings start to show some electronic noise.Improvements of the SX40 over the SX20 include (1) substituting powerful rechargeable lithium batteries with charger, thus replacing AA alkaline batteries in the SX20; (2) focal length up to 35X instead of 20X and; (3) a newer in-camera processor that increases the number of shots per second in each burst.  I should also mention that night shooting is handled in a very novel way with the SX40.  I won't get into it at this time.  As I use the camera more I'll probably find more improvements, but I think these are the most important.Would I recommend the SX40 to my friends?  You bet I would.  It is easy to use, makes great pictures, is light weight, and incredibly versatile.If you are contemplating the purchase of the SX40 you can first download the User Guide from the Canon USA website.

Video quality is good though I haven't done much with it. I really like the swivel LCD. I can get low, high & angled shots much easier now.A few things I didn't like.

Over the years, the technology got better. I like the Canon Powershots and the Nikon Coolpix cameras, but I needed more. They were ok for pocket cameras. I tried a Nikon Coolpix 8700 in 2006. Great camera, then, nice camera now. But like all electronics, the Nikon was out of date. You also have to remember these are computers with lenses. The Nikon Coolpix 8700 sold for $999 in 2004, $130 now. That's why I kept my budget under $400. I wanted lots of zoom, low light, fast focus, and not too complicated. The Canon SX40 HS was excellent in most catagories. With a 35x optical zoom, you can catch those close ups and image stability keeps them in focus. The 12MP also helps here. HD movies can be taken by pushing the convenient red button on the back. Flash on off is simple, flip up the flash, it's on, down it's off. I like that it also has a hot shoe on top for add on flash. It has a Li-on battery, which I have always had a good experience with on past Canons. Charge time is under 2 hours and it takes a huge number of pictures. You can always buy a spare if you are worried. I liked the rotating/flip LCD. Turned around it's protected. SO far the only cons are it seems slightly over-exposed when using the flash (easily corrected in Photoshop) and the lens cap design seems strange, the buttons are recessed. There are some special shooting settings and manual mode if you want to get creative. Canon makes the SX50 HS, which features 50x zoom and WiFi, for more money. Don't go too far on those zooms, they show more camera shake the farther you zoom and apperature gets a little extreme, all of which translate into fuzy pictures.

I read the Panasonic lumix has better shutter speed, so, if you're primary use for the camera is action or sports, than another camera might be better suited for you.Overall, I am very happy with the camera, outdoor pictures and pictures taken in good lighting look great. Again, the zoom in the camera is very fun to play with, and the stablization technology they have in the camera works very well. I recommend this camera for anyone who wants a step up from the point and shoot cameras while still maintaining the simplicity of use from that category.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon SX40hs \"Best Camera in the World\"", "Author": "ceeamerica", "ReviewID": "R2C9W00OAKV8HB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch Vari-Angle Wide LCD I bought the Canon SX30 IS a year and I loved it. I have been studying reviews of the Canon SX40hs and the Nikon P510 for many months now and decided hands down to get the Canon SX40 for the following reasons: A) The Canon SX40 takes excellent pictures and video not only through-out it's 35X Optical range but very good quality in it's digital range giving it a full 140X Zoom range. This is much further than any other brand and because they beefed up the processor, image stabilizers and lowered the mega-pixels so the cmos could do a better job. B) DIGIC 5 is the most powerful processor and the same one used in Canon's most expensive DSLR cameras costing thousands of dollars. It has made a major improvement on low-light and stabilizing. C) Nikon P500 & P510 will not stay in focus at the 42X little own trying to use the 2X digital zoom (Don't take my word, look at the video tests on Youtube there are many of them and the problems show up in all of them.)", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cool features and nice photos, but not the camera for me", "Author": "ARH", "ReviewID": "R1L07ECS0PSQAB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using a Canon SX40 HS to do a number of photo jobs lately, plus I've been generally playing around with it.  It's been fun.  I've done distance zoom photos as well as close-up work.FYI - Most of my photographic life (30+ years) has been spent with either fully manual or auto/manual focus 35mm film cameras.  That ended a few years back, and the digital cameras we have owned since have been mainly point-and-shoot affairs.  I've been missing the flexibility of a camera with a wider range of options, so lately I've been exploring the world of dSLR cameras.This is my first real experiment with a dSLR, and there are some things that I really like, and some things I find annoying.Likes:1) The camera is quite light, so hauling it around would not be that tough, especially if you have a small soft camera bag with a shoulder strap.2) The camera has a wide range of capabilities, and the 12.1 megapixels of this unit generate stunning images.  E.g., the first day I had it I was looking out my office window, across a parking lot to a sidewalk about 200 yds away.  I went to maximum zoom and shot pix of people walking along.  When I uploaded the photos to my iMac and gave them a look I was struck by shock and awe with the clarity of the photos.  I could actually see the expressions on people's faces.3) Digital zoom is good.4) Image stabilization is excellent.5) I HAVE to have more than just a digital screen on any camera I own - I need a viewfinder.  I REALLY like the fact that I can switch between viewing options.6) The swivel on the digital screen allows it to be closed and protected.Dislikes:1) Aftern spending most of my life with cameras like the Pentax K1000 and the Canon AE1, this camera body/construction feels, um, plastic-y, and, frankly, cheap.2) While the camera body does have a somewhat ergonomic design, it does not feel comfortable in my hand.  This would be particularly true if you have large hands.  My hands aren't all that big, but I do have long fingers.3) There is a spot on the back of the camera with some dimples indicating that is where your thumb is supposed to go, but I don't personally prefer to have my thumb in that position when I hold the camera, so again, it's not as comfortable in my hand as I'd like.4) The thumb spot is flanked by three buttons to the right, a function wheel below, and the video record button to the left.  In just the few days I've been playing around with this camera I've accidentally hit some of those buttons several times...kind of annoying.5) I prefer to keep a good solid grip on my camera whenever I'm using it, especially while shooting - probably a holdover from years of NOT having stabilization in my cameras :-), but the problem is that kept getting blurry photos that I KNEW were within the camera's focal capability.  It wasn't until that happened a number of times that I noticed a light shining on the inside of my left hand.  It was covering an electric eye on the front of the camera, on left side of the viewfinder.  I was inadvertently blocking the electric eye so the camera couldn't focus correctly.  Argh!  This means that you have to either rest the camera on your left hand or grip the left side of the camera below that eye...other options won't work.6) One last thing...if you have the digital screen flipped outward, but you opt to use the viewfinder your nose will leave a grease spot on the digital screen.  That is just not appealing, but I guess, um, where else are you going to put it? (your nose and the screen :-)I readily admit that I have not played with all the options, mainly because I discovered enough things about this camera's shape and action to know that it's not for me.  I also have not had it long enough to comment on battery life and related issues - sort of wish it wasn't just a rechargeable battery, but I understand why they did that.Don't get me wrong, this a great little camera, but if I'm going to spend hundreds of dollars I'd rather end up with a camera that I don't have to make as many adjustments as this one would require.Could I get used to this camera?  Yes.Does it do a good job?  Yes.Do I like it?  Yes.Do I love it?  No.Am I choosing this camera?  No, but it might be just the camera for you!

Sanserino", "ReviewID": "R2WXFZ8JLHCZTZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wish I had not bought this camera, but I needed one, and the price was really good.I LOVE Canon products. I have had several of their point and shoots and recently the S90 and S95 - little marvels that I take traveling around the world with great results. I also have a Canon printer and a Canon scanner - love 'em.  I wanted a camera more for local shooting, family parties, doing head shots,  etc. without the expense of a good DSLR and wide range zoom, and after exhaustive comparisons I chose the Canon when it was on a super sale. I already know how to use all the menus and hey - it's a CANON!!!  How could I go wrong?The colors and exposures are fantastic.  So why don't I like it?1. LENS. The zoom is ridiculous! the wide end is great, but IMO no one can use an 800mm zoom - 1600 mm with digital zoom!! Stupidly ridiculous - the same for other makers that are doing this.  It is impossible to hand-hold this even with six kinds of image stabilization, and if you are that serious about tripod mounted bird shots, etc, you should have a better camera.  I would GREATLY prefer a much smaller zoom range - say 300 mm and have the money and effort put into a faster f-stop that is maintained while zooming.  The SX-40 f-stop closes down so fast, that even at 100-120 mm for shooting portraits it is already too small to blur out the background. Stop playing the numbers game, Canon!Further - the lens is some special Canon only thread so you need an expensive adapter to be able to use standard filters, and then they are a larger and more expensive size. Thanks, Canon.2. ERGONOMICS - The camera is nice to hold, but when you put your thumb in the nice thumbgrip recess, there are 2 buttons right under your finger that you will always be pressing by accident.  I could not understand why the camera was doing weird things, and then I realized it was the button under my thumb while holding or picking up the camera. They could have been easily placed above the finger grip and should have been.All this I could still accept - especially for the price, except for:3. FOCUSING - No matter how I try, the pictures from this camera are consistently SOFT. Either it is just not focusing properly, or just not capable of a really sharp picture. I have been a pro and semi-pro for more than 40 years - I know how to hold a camera and squeeze off a shot. I could hand-hold my old Nikons for an acceptable  1/8 second exposure, but no matter how I try, the SX-40's photos are just never sharp - at least not to my eye.  I recently shot the same scenes with the Canon and my friend's cheapie Kodak and his photos were much more crisp when viewed on my computer screen.  I was in Seattle and shot the infamous gum wall about 100 times and literally NONE of the photos are crisp. I was 4 feet way in daylight - they should have been razor-sharp but weren't - just off a little.Unfortunately, by the time I have had it long enough to test it well, it is now too long to return it. However, once I find something to replace it with, it will go up for sale.

My hands are small, I am left-handed, and as one reviewer said somewhere, there is a great \"Canony\" feel and user-friendliness to them. I also NEED an optical viewfinder, which many other manufacturers did not include with their digital point and shoots, because most of my personal photography is outdoor. (Hopefully in the sun.) I still keep my little SD 1000 in my purse at all times, just in case!Anyway - at the end of 2010, Canon also had dropped its optical viewfinders on all but it's higher end cameras. So, with promises of an easy to read display, and a good bridge-type of zoom, I tried an SX 130. Good camera, but I really missed my optical viewfinder. Also had purchased a Panasonic high-def camcorder that did not have an optical viewfinder. After almost 2 years of giving these a fair chance, I got an email from Amazon about the SX40 HS, and started researching and dreaming about it.Finally bought from Amazon in February, 2012. I have used it on trips and on local birds and more. It is my favorite camera since my old A95, and of course I like the SX 40 HS even better due to the optical zoom capability. Amazing night and low light photography! Excellent high def video that is beautiful on a high def TV. I know that some people have complained that it only uses .jpeg files, and long-term I may miss this. However, I have found that I've used the .jpeg for about 95% of my digital photo needs over the past few years, and haven't needed anything else since I retired.

Will get to that in a minute. I am a long-time user of the Canon mega zooms and this sx40 is replacing my sx10is which I have been completely satisfied with, and still am. The longer zoom range on the new sx40 pushed me to the upgrade, otherwise I would not be replacing my older model Canon. There are some differences between these models, some good and some not so much. I think the viewfinder was bigger and brighter on the sx10, and that does matter to me as I use the VF exclusively when shooting. The new model is also noticeably lighter, probably because of the battery difference, a good thing for one who spends many hours out in the field. The other reviewers have covered the differences, pros and cons, very thoroughly so I won't go into any more of that here.The problem that I'm having with this camera is a sort of grinding or chugging sound of an internal motor when aiming the camera or moving between subjects/lighting. I think it might be the auto exposure adjustment. I do not have the camera set for continuous autofocus or continuous image stabilization, so I don't think that's the issue. The sound is not real loud, but it is very noticeable and quite annoying. My sx10 makes a slight (similar, but quieter) noise when the auto focus is working its magic, but that is brief and it only occurs when I engage AF when ready to shoot. The sx40 seems to do this almost constantly while the lens cap is off, and not just while shooting. Is this normal for this camera? I am just about to start the return process because the constant sound is that annoying to me. I've read all through the manual, that eye-frying CD pdf thing on the computer screen, and so far have not found if there is a way to make this stop. If this is typical of all of the sx40s, then it is something to be aware of. For me, I'd have shopped for a quieter model or even a different brand if necessary. I realize that all of the digital cameras including DSLRs make some mechanical sounds, but this seems like too much and too constant. There was never any issue with the sx10 at all.Might increase the rating as this problem resolves, because this camera otherwise deserves more than three stars.Update: Jan. 1, 2012:Thanks so much to the Amazon community for the comments and feedback on their own sx40s! I now know that others do not have this issue, so this particular camera is probably defective. I have revised my rating to four stars. I would easily give this camera five stars without any hesitation....except for that small viewfinder!

Seeing the craters on the moon, or the pupils of the eyes of birds shot at great distance... those were impressive! The image stabilization was as well. For the moon pictures I was fully zoomed (all the way through the digital range) and had only propped my elbows on a support--I did not use a tripod--and the image was sharp! I found macro shots of flowers to be exceptional as well. At the same time I recognize that a pro may not have been nearly as impressed as me, so remember--these are the impressions of an amateur.I do admit that pictures taken when fully zoomed are just usable as shot. Further zooming on the pc does not yield more detail or a more appealing picture. And the sharpness of the detail does trail off when fully zoomed, but some camera-knowledgeable friends had warned me that this is typical when shooting at high zoom levels.I won't say that even most of my macros or zooms were sharp, either--a good number were a bit out of focus. But the fact that SOME of them were means that the camera is capable and the user needs more practice.The one feature that I was not crazy over is where the camera tries to guess what you want to focus on and puts a box around it on the screen.

The Lumix is more compact, the shutter of the Lumix is more precise, the Lumix lense does not stick out as long at max zoom.The canon has longer zoom, but it's really only practical for stills on a tri or monopod as the IS cannot compensate for much movement at full zoom.  The variable angle display is useful and the fit and finish are first class as in all canons.  The shutter has some delay between pressing and actual picture taking.

At full 36x zoom, it's almost impossible to use the camera without a tripod. The stabilization is so poor that I just gave up taking shots without a tripod. Even then sometimes, the picture would be not very sharp.2. When using the HD movie recording mode, you cannot zoom in and out without losing clarity.3. While using the movie mode, you can hear the zoom motor in the recording. It's not bad when there is other noise in the recording but if silent then you can clearly hear the zoom motor at work.4. In low light conditions, the Nikon did not perform well. Especially if you try to take a shot without using the flash. Sometimes with the flash, the pictures were too bright.Frustrated, I started looking for \"superzoom\" cameras which offer the same optical zoom. After intensive research, i settled on 2, the Canon SX40 HS and the Panasonic Lumix FZ150. Although the Panasonic has got higher marks by the pro's, I selected the Canon due to the lower price and my overall experience with the Canon name.Glad, I selected the Canon. This is a awesome camera. The image stabilization is so good, i don't need the tripod when using the max 35x zoom. I can take superb pictures without having to carry around a tripod. Indoor pictures, especially in low light is staggering.

When I tried to use the manual focus I found that there really isn't one.  The manual says to select \"MF\" and then turn the adjusting ring to get an \"approximate\" focus.  You than supposedly use the auto focus for \"fine focus.\"  When I turn the ring when trying to manually focus as indicated in the instructions, then the slightest pressure on the multi-purpose ring puts the camera in a differnt mode.  The so-called \"fine focus\" does not work either.  Why go through all these useless gyrations and then end up using the auto focus button.  If I could focus with the auto focus on the shutter button I would not waste my time with the manual focus in the first place.The shutter lag on this model also seems to be much more than my older model.

There are only 2 criteria that must be met on my \"everyday camera\".  This one failed both.  It must take good sunsets because I don't always have my professional cameras with me when I see a gorgeous sunset.  The other criteria is that it must have both a good optical and digital zoom.  (I use the digital zoom for Identification of species and for moon photos.)1)  I usually buy a Panasonic Lumix for my everyday camera, and it takes fantastic sunsets if you put it on the \"Sunset\" setting, but I thought I would try the Canon because it had a better zoom.  The person I spoke with on the phone from Canon said that this camera did not need a Sunset setting because it automatically sensed when a sunset was being photographed and made the proper adjustments.  I don't agree.  Either it is not sensing it, or it isn't making the proper adjustments.  I can't see a difference between the images from my Panasonic when it is not set on \"Sunset\" and this camera.  There is a huge difference with my Panasonic when it is set on \"Sunset\" and this camera.2)  I wanted a really good Optical Zoom and it had to also have a Digital Zoom available.  I use the Optical Zoom for most photos but I use the Digital Zoom for identification of bird species and for photographing the moon).  But the Digital Zoom is not available in the 3:2 aspect ratio setting and I keep my camera set on 3:2.  3:2 is the ratio you need for printing 4x6 photos.  Any of the other ratios require you to go into a photo editor and crop the image to a 3:2 ratio before printing your 4x6's.  Otherwise, the photo processing place will automatically crop it for you and it may not be cropped where it should be.  I had one place cut off the ears of a bear when it should have cropped off the bottom of the photo instead.  I could change it to 16:9 and take a photo of the moon and then set it back and then crop it on my computer later, but isn't that a bunch of extra steps when they could have just made the Digital Zoom available for all ratios?!So the only thing I like about this camera is the optical zoom being at 35x.

My first camera was a Minolta ST101 with a number of fixed focal length lenses.  Used for many years and then I went to a Cannon EOS.  I was thrilled when lens technology produced a 28-200 mm zoom.  It worked for 90%+ of what I wanted to do but it was big and heavy.Enter the digital camera.  My first was a 2 mpxl Canon Elph.  It took good pictures but not what I was used to.  It fit in my pocket though and convenience was a factor.  I went through several digital cameras as technology developed and my current unit (soon to be back-up) is a Panasonic ZS8.  It takes very good pictures and fits in my pocket.  The EOS was sold on EbayNow, I miss my SLRs viewfinder and all the settings I could adjust to tweak the image.  I do not miss hauling around a bag full of lenses and accessories not to mention exposed film. Enter the bridge camera now come of age.I did hours of research on various camera review sites and on Amazon.  I narrowed my choices to a Fuji HS30 EXR, a Canon SX40HS and a Panasonic FZ60.  On paper I had a difficult time as to which was the best one and ultimately ordered the Canon based open many prior very good experiences with Canon.  I also would have a good idea how to negotiate the camera settings pretty well.It\u2019s a great camera.  I took pictures in the back yard of birds and squirrels, macros of flowers, kids at play and some landscapes with difficult lighting.  I took it on a weekend trip and took some night shots and beach shots and purposely pushed its limits.  I found it a bit slow to focus, especially at the long end and further still with lower light conditions.  I did not like using the motorized long lens and the viewfinder; it was somehow clumsy.I sent it back and got the Fuji HS30 EXR.  First thing I noticed was that focusing is quick and accurate.  I really like how the manual zoom feature works.  It\u2019s a little thing but the size and grip feel better in my hand.The professional reviews made issues of the dots in the viewfinder and the LCD but I did not find those to be issues.  The menu in the Canon is easier to negotiate, maybe because I\u2019ve been there before.  I find the Fuji lens to be plenty long enough but Cannon is clearly longer.  The Canon is better at exposure in difficult lighting but I am used to bracketing under those conditions.  Time will tell but the Canon\u2019s face recognition appears to be better but I will more likely use my Panasonic ZS8 when taking people pictures anyway.When I made the purchase, I was trying to capture the best of a good pocket camera and an SLR and hence my interest in a bridge camera.

The front of the lens is threaded for what appears to be 52mm threaded accessories.  However the thread is not a standard pitch and 52mm accessories such as filters and lens shades will not attach.  Canon does make a filter adapter that bayonets on the outside of the lens but it requires you to use a 67mm filter.  This makes the lens cap useless and destroys the relatively compact lines of the camera.  In addition when the filter adapter is mounted you cannot use the lens shade.  When I called Canon about this they told me this was a simple point and shoot camera so they didn't think it was important to be able to mount a filter and lens shade together.  Oddly Canon describes this as a \"High End Advanced Digital Camera\" on their website.  This IS an advanced \"bridge\" camera designed for advanced amateurs and pros.  When I posted this review on Canon's sight they sent me an e-mail stating they were deleting my review.  I guess they can't handle the truth.  When I asked Canon what the front threads were for they stated they were auxiliary lenses even though Canon doesn't make any for this camera.

All profs catered only to other profs with high end, not understood to non-professionals who want to shoot day to day family\\school\\picnic\\sight seeing\\school events\\kids sports etc.Had it for a day and tested for 4 hours.  I hv checked Sony HX100V, not extensively, and liked what I saw,  but intend to do so now, since I returned this unit.  I chose Canon over Sony because:- can shoot slow motion videos- can transfer files easily compared to Sony (Need to use converter s\\w to convert .MTS files which is not a standard to play it in Vista, or any standard video players on computer)- almost 40 bucks cheaper- this one has 35 x compared to 30x (need to compare full zoom quality in both though)- BODY CONSTRUCTION: is very cheap plastic type construction, compared to Nikon P500 and Sony HC100V, but not a big concern.- BAD LENS COVER: lens cover barely sits in the groove, whose depth is barely enough to seat the cover. There is no tight grip of the cover to the camera body- FILE TRANSFER TO COMPUTER:  Just plug in the provided USB cable, to USB port on computer; copy and paste.  I didn't install software provided.  Have Windows Vista, which detected camera and installed drivers automatically.  Transfer rate is pretty fast. About 5 mts for about 1\\2 GB.- NO PRINTED MANUAL: Need to use their PDF file.- NO DIGITAL ZOOM (FULL ZOOM UP TO 140X) FOR 3:2 ASPECT RATIO.  Meaning: if you regularly need standard 4 x 6 prints, camera needs to be set to to 3:2 ratio.  With that setting, digital zoom is set to off automatically (also mentioned in manual).  You are left with max of 35x optical zoom.  If you intend to use the digital zoom feature (until full 140x), need to set it to 4:3, which gives full 140x dig zoom, but then every time you need to take a 4 x 6 print you need to crop each picture (online or using a s\\w) and also be aware of leaving that crop space every time a picture is taken.  Regular 5 x 7 print users have not problem.  This disadvantage is irrelevant for video.- DIGITAL PICTURE SIZE: I set cam to full 1080 HD, 4:3 aspect ratio (need for full zoom).  I shot my son playing ball\\just trees around my home\\some photos inside my home.  Approximate size of each dig picture is 1.4 MB to 2.4 MB. If you want to take continuous pictures in fast action like in sports (called burst mode, max 8 pictures in one click), file size is about 5 MB each, not sure why.- BURST MODE: is pretty good.  Used full zoom (140x) and shot hand held (no tripod) video and pictures of my son playing ball at a distance of 300-350 ft IN BURST MODE.  Both pictures and Video very good quality.  Am sure with tripod for that distance it would be great.  You need to switch camera to SCN (scene) mode for this function, since, you can't do in AUTO mode.  There is another continuous shots function under SPORTS mode, I checked it indoor and found to be very blurry (could be becoz of low light)- VIDEO FILE SIZE: 14-15 GB for 1 hour in full HD mode.  I have videos ranging from 10 sec to 4 mts. example (45 sec, 184 MB  \\ 3 min 51 sec - 920,479 KB).  Consistent with Canon specs).  If you shoot at full HD, stock up 32 GB memories (found for $ 20 on sale)- TIME LAG BETWEEN SHOTS: It takes about 2.5 to 3 secs to take pictures from one to another without flash.  With flash, you at least 5 - 5 1\\2 secs to take next shot.  Burst mode is the alternative.  Pictures blurry (auto focus mode) in low light. My 10 yr old dig cam is almost about same may be a 1\\2 sec slow.  I guess that's the available technology for Point and shoot cameras.- INCONSISTENT AUTO FOCUS:  I tested with smoothest movement of zoom to fast zoom in and zoom out, with just only 35x optical zoom and full 140x digital zoom, then with smooth horizontal movement (panning) to fast horizontal moving, with absolutely no zoom (wide angle) to various positions of zoom  until max zoom.Result: Without zoom, quality is kind of acceptable.  With zoom, on this camera it was 50-50%.  Sometimes great, sometimes very annoying. When zooming in mostly, video was jerky, as if some portion of video was intermittently cut. 50% of the time camera struggled to get proper focus, need to zoom in and out to get it right.  In such videos, could see horizontal lines in the video.  Unreliable is the word.  (See below) Could be my camera was defective.- LOW LIGHT PHOTOS:  Excellent since I used only auto mode and I mean really low light, just a 40 watt bulb. My review is comparable with cheaper than this point and shoot, and equivalent cameras in auto focus only.- HOPELESSLY NOISY ZOOM:  Zoom makes considerable noise when zooming in and out, and its almost scary that makes you think if this is going to last long.  The saddest part (for which I returned the camera) is once you play back on computer or TV, the noise is horrible.  If you take quite videos rest assured it makes as much sound as there would be some fountain or waterfalls around.  As mentioned again, some videos are smooth to look at while in zoom, some of them have this jerks while zooming in and zooming out, very often loosing focus.  But in case it zooms well, then the pictures\\videos are awesome.I guess zoom noise is a standard with high zoom cameras, its a personal choice to go with handy cam or buy a 2 in 1 bridge camera like this one- RATTLING\\KNOCKING SOUND INSIDE CAMERA: This might be a lemon that I got. At every zoom you can hear a knocking sound physically while recording, which am sure is the mechanism inside or the lens not moving properly.  That probably explains the jerky movement seen in the video.  Knocking noise can be heard in the video too.  It sounds like someone beating a tin or cardboard around. Heard this in a couple of other videos on YouTube.  I have recorded about 15 mts video on Sony HX100V using zoom, but didn't have the zoom noise this bad and definitely not the knocking sound.  I am assuming that my camera had some defects.- BATTERY LIFE:  I used the camera in total to shoot about 45 mts video and about may be about 500 pictures.  Started using camera at about 5 pm to 5 pm next day with actual power on not more than 2 - 2 1\\2 hours.  Battery drained out.  Seemed to be consistent with specs of cannon (they say max 380 shots if LCD used, which I did all the time)I wanted to upload the videos, but there is a limitation of 100 MB.  I will upload it to youtube and update this review with the linkReturned my camera, with the belief that my camera was defective, and that this model is really good (it had all signs of a great camera).  All those 5 & 4 stars could not be wrong, compared to the minority of 1, 2 and 3 starsRATING:  Deserves a 3 1\\2 to 4 star, if knocking sound is not there and auto focus is not as bad in my particular camera.  But I give it 2 for now because I think, I got a defective camera.  Canon should ensure good quality.  I wouldn't give 5 stars because of the limitations I found.Will do same test again with my friends camera (same model). Will update to higher rating if my test proves that my camera was a bad luck, and not a standard equipment.

I am very pleased with almost eeverything I have tried to do with this camera. A little disappointed with it's being a little too smart about choosing what object I want to focus on.  I guess its the face recognition looking for a face when there is no face with a body on it.  I did zoom in on a neighbors pump about 500 feet away and it focused on the electrical junction box mounted on it's top considering it to be a person's head.I haven't had it long enough to check out all of it's capabilities but color quality, zoom, very little optical distortion and low light capabilities are all very good.I go after birds, beautiful sunsets and flowers mostly. Haven't had the right conditions for sunsets/sunrises this winter which is the best time and spring is just around the corner for the flowers.I didn't mention that I also own an older Canon 4X zoom which had excellent picture quality and color but didn't measure up for what I needed for optical zoom. I did read some reviews on the SX40 and my experience with the older Canon made me choose this one.

I really was not expecting much other than to be able to take closeup pictures in low light. My wife makes jewellery and she needed this camera to take closeup pictures of the jewellery. Let me explain the difference between Macro Photography and zooming.  Both relate to closeups.  In macro photography, the camera is very close to the physical object and the optical lenses do most of the work.  This camera is great for that, and so was SX150.  When I placed the camera, two to three feet apart from the object and try to zoom in, I could never get it to focus in Automatic as well as manual mode.  The best test you can do it to sit on a chair and spread your legs, and try to focus on your toe.

An amazing lens achievement.I wish Canon had incorporated an integral lens thread, rather than having to use a hokey adapter that sort of snaps on, then comes off when looked at crosswise.And I wish Canon's accompanying software was better. They have dropped some features that used to be present (e.g. RemoteCapture app), and they have made CameraWindow.app SO terribly kludgey.EDIT - We have started digitizing our ancient 35mm slides directly with this camera. No fancy adapter needed - happily, the close-focus and automation of this camera make the task a snap! We added a 58mm adapter and a +2 diopter lens (to avoid the barrel distortion at wider angles), and we modified a 58mm ring with notches to stabilize the position of the subject slide. Using either macro mode and autofocus, or manual focus at about 0.8 inch, works very nicely.

Everyone keeps talking about the resolution, color quality, etc. Here is where this camera absolutely sucks. The aperture control is 100% useless unless your subject is 6 inches away from the camera and everything else is far away. I had been tinkering with the aperture priority, thinking I just didn't know how to control it and then finally called Canon support and they told me that's as good as it gets with this camera. I was trying to take what would be called a \"portrait\" for my blog, where I was in focus and the street behind me was blurry, so that street signs, parking meters, parked cars, etc where NOT in focus. I had the F-stop on 2.7 and the entire street scene behing me was 100% in focus. I tried the portrait setting - same thing.The other thing with this camera is the long lapse between pictures. So if you are snapping pics of kids running or moving around, it's very hard to snap several pics in a row quickly. You can put it in Sport mode which helps a little but if you put it in BURST mode, it's basically too many shots at once and you will end up editing hundreds of bad images to just get one of your kid running and kicking a ball.I bought this because I did not want to go out and spend $1,000 on a camera but now I regret it because there truly are a lot of limitations.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"},

Writing to the memory card is slow (I think I need a faster card), so repeat shots are delayed. Taking pictures of moving subjects is annoying almost to the point of uselessness.The LCD display is pretty good, and is visible in bright light.My Rebel Xti is not a lot bigger or heavier, and shoots rings around this camera.

On a full moon night, you CAN'T zoom all the way out (digital) - you would only get a PORTION of the moon! :-) The digital zoom shots are still pretty good (but of course not as good as non-digital).This camera has WAY more settings than my other one. I am still learning about the different modes. I mainly shoot in Aperture because most of my stuff is still life. I also shoot as pure as possible, and prefer to edit to my tastes in Photoshop. Therefore, I don't use a lot of the tricks the SX40 can do. I'm not sure about additions you can add (filters, etc), and I only shot a few videos just for the fun.

Many of the videos show that this lens zooms in like a mile and can capture a picture of a lady on a beach etc.  Truth be told, theyused both optical and digital zooms!  It gives a max of 140x so don't be fooled into buying this item.real zoom is: 24 - 840 mm on a full frame / 35mm camera.  Now considering a popular Tamron 17-50mm is equivalent to 27-80mm, on a 35mm camera / full frame, this superzoom is even wider!!  it's even wider than the 16-35mm canon on cropped camera body like the Canon T3i.  So it's wide enough without using a fisheye.  So in a way, this super accurate zoom with a wide to very long is it's major strength.To a professional photographer, minimal requirement I wanted from a non-SLR:a) real view finder so that you can better capture the moment.b) manually hand adjustable zoom for quick focus.c) ability to shoot raw mode.d) quick and snappy, thus you want an SLR, and once you touch one, you won't go back.e) hot shoe for bounce flash.pro:-super accurate focus even at 35x.  you won't have the focus accuracy issues with SLR lens.  So if your copy doesn't sharp, return it cuz there's something wrong.  Razor sharp.-wide enough and has the reach.-has hotshoe ** first big requirement met.-no dust on the sensor so no cleaning dust bunnies off pictures shot with high aperature.-can do good video.-color is good.-seems to have good dynamic range.cons:-no real viewfinder, the electric viewfinder has a lag.-no manual hand adjustable zoom.  i don't believe there is a superzoom that has this ability built into a compact camera..but I would like to see it.-cannot shoot raw without a hack.-the picture quality is a bit patterned if you pixel peep...so this is why i prefer raw.-raw format is available if you load the free chdk hack, google it.  But that hack is a pain to use for the sake of shooting raw.  my biggest grip with the chdk hack is that every time the camera turns off you would have to open the battery door and enter the hack mode, which is a pain unless you set the camera not to turn off, which will drain the battery.  i will modify this if i find a better way, but this is a major draw back to using the hack.  update:  there's a way to make the hack boot everytime automatically.. read the comments.  But the point that really killed this camera is the slowness in which raw and super-fine jpg operates in hacked mode.  It takes about 1 to 2 seconds per raw and super-fine jpg, in CHDK hack.  :-(  Canon may have crippled the buffer too.-it's extremely slow to shoot in raw format.. you would have to wait a second or so after a shoot. :(-I'm majorly disappointed that canon disabled raw on this camera.  Consider getting the Panasonic dmc-fz150.  I really don't think you need all this zoom.-I expected raw for the amount of money I spend on this camera.  This is NOT a sub $200 camera.  if canon goes cheap then I got to get real and rate it as an unsatisfactory camera in this respect, thus 2 stars.  If canon decides to give a firmware that allows raw, then I will increase the rating.  It is not a 3 star because I'm not satisfied with it.  a 3 star is satisfied but not good or excellent.-no audio in port.  another reason for 2 stars.  get real canon.  the dmc-fz150 has it.  only problem there is that if I were to get a dmc-fz150, i rather get an SLR with a super zoom lens.-I don't understand why not all mode has the super frame burst of 7 or 8 shots per second.. it's kinda slow to have 2 frames per second though I know it could do a lot better.  I'm talking about jpg.  Can someone explain this to me??  Another reason why it's a two star camera.-small hdmi.  i don't understand why canon didn't use the standard sized hdmi.. otherwise, for the price they could have included a $2.50 cable.Clearly from the above, canon wasn't really at the wheels during design and marketing.. i dont' think canon has the customer's best interest in mind.. now if an american or other company can come and fix what's missing from the sx40, that company will do very well.  I don't understand it, why limit people's ability to shoot raw when clearly, the camera can do it.  And certainly it doesn't cost too much to add chips to provide better buffer for burst shoots in raw mode too.-somehow, my palm accidentally presses some of the buttons.. I think the buttons can be better situated.-canon can do itself a favor by not hiding the hotshoe.. I don't know why they did that, and now, the camera even looks ulgier with those three holes in front of the hot shoes once the cover is removed.. having a hotshoe is a good selling point.  you don't see SLR's concealing their hotshoe.  are you thinking canon??-i'm not sure but.. I can't seem to find different focus points for this camera.. it has the auto focus where it will seek out other focus areas..-after being accustomed to SLR's, for my daughter's pre-k graduation, I used this camera, and didn't think I would use it again for such event.  Primarily the reason is that it's a pain to use point and shoots once you get use to shooting with an SLR.  Frankly, i'd save the money and catch dmc-fz150 on sale or go for an SLR if u got the money.The only reason I got this camera is because I got it for two seventy at fry's on sale.  Just to let you know how I feel about this camera, I'm thinking about ebaying it.. there's a reason why this camera went on sale cuz the dmc-fz150 is probably killing it.extraneous info:  shoots video at about 4 megs per second, so get class 10 cards.  My Class 6 samsung sd and a class 10 wintec professional card works, so I didn't need the expensive sanddisk.  the wintec gives 10 megs per second write.  be sure to use a utility to write the whole SDHC card before using it then format it in camera.--------------------------update, june 6, 2012:I visited the Panasonic camera I mentioned, the 150 model (can't remember the rest of the model number, wish panasonic keep it easy).  anyway, I was tempted to get that camera, but then I've read some of their two stars to have \"soap bubble.\"  Cameras are not perfect, so to make this a darn near perfect camera, I really wish canon would come out and release a better firmware to enable raw and to give an option to enable / disable the one second limitation.  To me, it seems like panasonic's soap bubble issue to be more of an issue, so I'll still stand by this camera for the moment, though I'm not happy with it.  The choice was the wait or get it at the sale price that was presented to me.  In conclusion, I don't regret it, but the rating stays until there's a better firmware.  I will update my post regarding the firmware hack about how it to use the bootable sd card method for CHDK hack.  I'll also update with quick start manual on the chdk cuz documentation there is horrible.  see below for the update in regards to firmware cuz I don't think amazon likes people to provide links in their reviews.--------------------------update, June 17, 2012:I'll come back and revise my previous comments made about Canon sticking to Lithium ion batteries instead of AA later today.  According to this site, it appears that there's reasons why camera makers go with lithium ion batteries over even eneloop batteries, see comments since amazon likes to delete stuff without reading it.--------------------------update, june 15, 2012:  please read all comments if you decide to comment, otherwise, you're wasting time.----", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not as great as made out to be, disappointed, returned for FZ-150", "Author": "acdeals \"Electronics Geek\"", "ReviewID": "RBXOB2EXZQEXF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was very disappointed with the camera.

But I didn't do my homework, and overestimated Canon's competence. I ended up having the return my SX40. One of the best things about this series of cameras has always been the use of 4 AA batteries. This gives tremendous freedom, using those wonderful Eneloop rechargables most of the time, but being able to throw in regular AAs in a pinch. Being reliant on a proprietary battery pack is just silly. I also made the mistake of assuming Canon had fixed its lack of an external mike input. In these days, when we're all posting videos to YouTube for business or for fun, not being able to plug in a shotgun mike seriously compromises the video value of this camera. Too bad: I'm a big fan of Canon products, but they've lost this customer.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Actually, 5 stars if you need this zoom.", "Author": "Coug Moog \"s_gil\"", "ReviewID": "R12OM8RFAIAV52", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't. I want portability, not super zoom. So I bought an S95 and have used it the past year. Got this cam for the 10 percent of shots I thought I wasn't getting with the S95 and guess what? I'm still not getting them because the SX40 doesn't fit in my pocket.If I want to carry a bulky camera I'll haul out the T2i. A point and shoot should not be this big. Now, if you are only going to have one camera and you absolutely have to have the biggest zoom in a point and shoot...you've found it. This thing's a long-ranger. It gives you standard barrel distortion that Canon mostly removes via in-camera processing.Its controls are more frustrating than the S95. To get basic parameter changes I have to drill into menus. The S95 has enough tactile control to make adjustments faster for less fiddling when you want to be getting the shot. But it has a \"framing zoom only.\" I like that. You may hate it. But if I see a distant subject I want to photograph, I GO OVER THERE. You will always get better detail than if you just point a long zoom at it. I realize there are shots I'm not going to get, particularly of wildlife or over water or from a distant lookout or whatever.But honestly that's not the kind of shot I pursue anyway. I like the funky stage-lit concert shot at House of Blues when I'm close enough to get a full-length lead singer portrait in mid-kick. The red barn against the blue sky. The inside of a candlelit rustic restaurant in the inn built in the 1700s. The S95, with its f/2.0 lens, flat out blows the SX40 into the weeds for the kind of color and light I love.I think I'll list my new SX40 on ebay and see how the new S100 is. I hear they put a built-in ND filter on this one. Same sensor as the SX40, faster lens. What's not to like?Yes, I'll still miss those superzoom shots. But since I don't take superzoom shots anyway, no loss for me. I gain it back tenfold in image quality, especially in low light. And best of all, the camera is always with me so when an interesting image presents itself, I have the tool to make the photograph right in my pocket.I have a G12 that's gathering dust as well. The S95 has the same sensor and processor and IMHO a better lens than the G12, and fits in a pocket.The SX40's party trick is that telescope they hung on it. If you must have that huge zoom, this is your camera. For me it introduces more shake than I can handle even with IS and I have to lock it on a tripod to get anything like a usable image at long range. The tradeoff is poor low light performance and less creative control of my shots, as well as all the bulk involved in lugging the Hubble around with me. I see why this camera is popular with shooters who dig that zoom, and for that it's awesome. If you are one of those then you know who you are.

The grip on the right front was shallow for my finger grasp and I don't have large hands. The top of the grip should have had a more pronounced finger stop. It had only a shallow one. The grip surface didn't have a sure grip rubber feel like Nikon and other cameras of similer value.  I felt it could easily dropped at any time. The electronic viewer was indeed, too small and I just didn't think the overall look of the camera, was as snazzy as the Nikon sitting next to it.

Also, the description talks about plugging the camera into an HDMI devise with the included HDMI cable - it does not come with an HDMI cable - only a USB cable!  It gives you a hot shoe cover storage bag (can you say useless??!!) - but no where does it tell you in the extremely poor getting started pages how to remove the hot shoe cover!
