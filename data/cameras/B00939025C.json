Hawthorne", "ReviewID": "RLSU8JHBJJY2A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because I thought it would be perfect for my website and blog use.  So far, it has lived up to its expectations.  It is not a hefty camera, but do not ber deceived by a lack of weight.  I do a lot of interior available light shooting so I use the low light feature in the SCN mode.  It produces excellent photos at varying high ISO settings - which it selects automatically.  I have used the other modes and am equally pleased with them.  The image stabilization is excellent but you must remember to turn it off if you are using a tripod or you may get some strange results.  The video mode was more than satisfactory in 720 HD.  Is it as good as a digital SLR?  No.  But for the size, cost, and what it is capable of, it will be a camera that will get many uses in the years to come", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value And pics", "Author": "Jbw563", "ReviewID": "RW84LA1ROC79S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only complaint would be it is a little slow to reload after taking each picture.

Reviews made it seem like a good camera.  I just bought an Olympus Pen e-pl2 for not much more than this camera.  There is no comparison in my opinion.  I do not recommend the camera.  The quality of photos is just average, which doesn't cut it for me with a $250 price tag.  If this was a $100 camera, I would say it is not a bad camera but I still wouldn't want it.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "For a good picture and fun", "Author": "mighty_useful", "ReviewID": "R2YB0URII5GYV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I lost my father's camera, so this was the replacement.

I wish I had noticed the small hole where the flash comes out of.  Any camera that has that small of an opening to take flash pictures, can not take decent, good or great pictures in low light conditions.  Everything else about this camera, I like.

Being a casual photographer and having issues with hand shake (she used my Olympus and it was apparent) ease of use, lightness, and image stabilization were very important features. This all-in-one package including the memory card (16gb) and carry case, was a very good deal for the price.She has received it and used it a few times to get used to it. The layout is different than the Easyshare, more like my Olympus, but she is reporting it easy to get used to. The image stabilization is excellent from the test pictures she's sent; for the light duty casual and infrequent photographer, I think this was a good choice for the money. The optical zoom is very good, and returning good pictures.As an adult beginner and light duty camera; for capturing life events; this seems to be a very good choice. I would recommend it.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Haven't developed pics yet", "Author": "Renee", "ReviewID": "R1PABYTTD3Z12B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this camera so far!

That isn't going to happen.  However this camera is super for my needs.  I was trying to get pictures of baby hawks that were in a nest (pretty high up) in a tree.  My camera just wouldn't focus well at that distance.  My daughter brought her Canon PowerShot SX500 IS over for me to use.  I got fabulous pictures of the babies in the nest and the parental unit always perched nearby.  I bought my own that same night!  This is a wonderful camera for zooming in at reasonable distances.  It's easy to use.  I loved that it came with so many accessories!  I priced it at BestBuy before buying it from Amazon.  That day it was on sale - with absolutely no accessories - for the same price as I got it from Amazon.  It also came with everything I needed/wanted - a charger, extra battery, memory card, and even the cutest little table tripod.  The only thing anyone would want in addition to this would be a large tripod and I already owned one.  I would highly recommend this camera/package to anyone!

So far, all the pictures I have taken have turned out fabulous and that's using auto focus.  I love it!

I have gotten some shots that I have never been able to accomplish on previous similarly equipped cameras.  I am delighted with the smaller size due to a past neck surgery.  It is light enough that it does not pull and hurt when wearing around neck for extended periods.I have taken pictures in low light, indoors, outdoors, sunsets, extended digital zoom and have not had issues.  The only thing that I have to say that may be negative (and it is very minor) is that I have shot a few shots when I was meaning to focus in.
