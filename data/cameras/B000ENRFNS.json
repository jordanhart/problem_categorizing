{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Digital Camera I've ever used", "Author": "PACOBELL", "ReviewID": "R1RMJ43UTG0RM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To date I have used several digital cameras from several different manufacturers.  From old 2 and 3MP cameras, up to a 9MP SLR.When I decided to purchase this camera my main reason was its' abilities to take low light pictures without the flash.  Using a flash in the LA Convention Center for picture taking during the Auto show tends to get too many reflections, without flash you get natural looking pictures, more battery power, but until this camera, i could never even get close to the feeling I wanted with the ease, which means more user friendly for quick on the spot moments, no matter the environment.I researched many camera's before I decided to get this one. I compared all of the features.  For the price the W100 blew away the competition. But that is what is just on paper.Now I actually have the camera and have taken at least a hundred pictures in different situations testing out all the little options, from full auto to full manual.Using the ISO at 1250 does result in a picture with noise however, the noise is very little, even compared to my Dad's Fuji 9MP SLR.Although, this is a compact camera, it is big enough to grab onto, but still small enough to look cool.Having 8MP allows you to really zoom in on a picture, and once again this is a cheap price for 8.1MP.My brother's have the newer Kodak 5MP compact camera I think it is the 55 model, and my sister just bought the lower sony DSC-W50, which is about 150 cheaper.  But even comparing the DSC-W100 to the W50, you would instantly recognize the higher quality.After using the camera, its' low light sensitivity and lack of picture noise, enable faster shutter times, which is good for night shots, along with the 42-step, 30 sec max exposure time, which is very fun to use, but the higher sensitivity enables you to take pictures of quick moving opjects as well, and you can program the camera for this, but i do wish it had the pre-programmed option  for quick moving shots.  Although it is not hard to manually set up the shot with a few tweaks.  Most of the changes you make manually the LCD will give show you a basic idea of the what you are changing, along with the on screen explanations of every option, which makes the user manual almost pointless, which is a good thing, in this case.With the camera's inherent ability to take low light shots, this greatly reduces the chance of getting a blurry picture, unless you are really moving.  I hate taking a bunch of pictures and getting blurry shots (rememeber I don't like using the flash) but so far out of the hundred pictures, I would say I have had 5, but they were all forseeable, (ie I knew i was moving at the time or the object was moving)  And the camera warns you on screen when the capturing time is going to be long enough that you should try and be more stable.Today I got a picture of a bird in flight up close outside, and it looked like a low motion capture, you could see the feathers in the wing, it was not just a blurred mass.I have used mostly the manual and semi-manual features which all are very easy to use and take great pictures, if you know what settings to use where.  I have not used the fully auto mode very much, as I have not really needed too, the specialized modes pretty much cover everything, I have also not taken many portraits, except of my own face, on full auto and it looks good 95% of the time, and i would say with all the previous cameras I have used including old 35mm slrs and advantix, this is the best camera i have ever had.So if you are looking for a camera as good or better than some SLR's in all cases except a detachable lens, for the price and size of a sub-compact camera, I highly recommend this camera, it is what it says on paper.  But as with any camera if you aren't sure go to the store where they have 50 million on display, just make sure to look at this one, although it might not be in the store yet.UPDATE: MAY 6, 2006In response to Techburn's review, yes it is true you cannot use the lens accesories with the W100 as of now, but I would expect more accessories to come out in the future for this camera, the physical structure is only slightly larger than the lower W-models, and since this is the higher end, brand new model, I say the chance of add-ons is very likely.64Mb of internal memory is more than most other cameras have, but most people expect to buy a memory card for their camera.I can pull the Duo out of my camera and view the stills in my PSP.  And Duo prices are cheap these days, on the net.I have experiemented with freeway shots from a moving vehicle taking shots from the oncoming side, and with little practice I was getting nearly perfect sharp pictures of the other vehicles, that would be a vehicle speed difference of 70+70=140mph,  plus the shaking from the truck.I can fit this camera with no case perefectly in my pocket, with slack left; dickies pant size 32x32 5'7\" 170 lbs. Although i would not walk around with a 350 dollar camera in my pocket, but I can also fit it in my shirt pocket, that is a medium size dickies work shirt.  Before I got the camera I was worried about the size, but its  nice, and yes the buttons are small, a problem with all compact cameras, actually all cameras.The battery has lasted a month on just the initial charge, I have taken almost 300 shots, although not many with the flash, because i didnt need to.The movie quality is good especially at 30fps, and yes like other sony's it cannot zoom in and out during capture.Another thing to note, the menu structure  using the camera is very detailed and self explanatory, when choosing options, you don't need to go and look up what each setting will do depending on how you adjust it, it tells you what you need to know.Things I do have complaints about;Whites can seem very bright, I attribute this to its high sensitivitythere is no \"anti-shake\" mechanism, most still cameras do not have this, although Panasonic has come out with some which might be worth checking out.I just ordered some prints from costco, and I will update again on the results from the different sizes.Just remember to compare this camera to others in its price range and physical size.", "Date": "April 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "The Pocket SLR (Almost)", "Author": "William H III", "ReviewID": "RUAG8JV9RHPCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Photography afficionados have long had two choices when it comes to buying a digital camera: a tiny everything-automatic portable camera that takes decent pictures or a brick-sized everything-manual professional camera that takes fantastic pictures. Almost a decade after the introduction of the consumer digital camera, Sony has finally taken a swing at combining the best qualities of both worlds into one package, and the DSC-W100 is a solid first effort.Sony has had the tiny part down for some time - dimensionally, the W100 is on par with other recent Cybershot models and competitor brands' offerings, and features the now-common 2.5\" bright LCD display with a minimum of buttons on the back. Aside from the attractive mini-diamondplate face and chrome trim, visually there's little to set this camera apart among the others at your local electronics counter.Initial toying with the camera doesn't dispel any first impressions. All the prerequisite automatic features are there, the buttons are smartly arranged so all the most common functions are right at hand, it's obviously a point-and-shoot camera. But it's when you begin to delve into the features that you realize that the W100 is something entirely different.The usual mode knob is there on the back with the Auto mode and Scenes modes, but now there's Program and Manual modes - something standard issue on professional cameras but radically new for a point-and-shoot. This means you can use any combination of auto or manual settings on all functions to get a shot. For example, shooting in a dimly lit room, you can use a slow shutter flash to even out lightning, or turn off the flash with a slower shutter for richer colors, or raise the ISO so you can get a steady shot with a higher shutter speed, or just put it in auto and shoot, etc. All the different possibilities previously reserved just for professional cameras are now at your disposal. The camera is as simple or as involved as you want, and it still fits in your pocket.I've owned several other digital cameras, both portable and pro, and they've all had somewhat manual features, but the W100 takes it to a new level. Mounting the W100 on a tripod, I attempted to get a long exposure shot of the night sky, something all the other digital cameras have done adequately. Manually setting the shutter speed, the camera displayed the overall exposure value as I adjusted - the camera was telling me before even touching the shutter button if the resulting picture would be dark, bright, or even. I set the shutter as slow as it could go and using the two-second timer, fired away. The picture was amazing; though only a few stars were visible to the eye, the W100 caught the light of well over a hundred. I noticed a bit of radial blur on the stars around the border of the image, only to realize later that the camera was pointed North - the shutter speed was so slow that I was actually *capturing the rotation of the Earth*. Now THAT'S manual.Also of special note is the W100's digital \"Smart Zoom\". As a general rule with digital cameras, you should disable the digital zoom feature, as zooming in beyond the optical range produces a cropped and therefore lower-quality image. But here again Sony has a trick up it's sleeve, by cropping from an 8.1 megapixel capture regardless of where you have the image size set. If you shoot a 5 megapixel-size picture that utilizes the digital zoom, the image is actually captured at a full 8.1 Mps and then your 5Mp picture is cropped from that. The result is an optically-zoomed clear picture. This also means that at the lowest image size, you can get a full 15x zoom (the equivalent of a 500+ mm telephoto - in a pocket camera!). It's an absolutely brilliant technique that you'll probably see on all future digital cameras.Sony still has a bit more work to do on the pocket SLR idea. Included with your purchase is an accessories catalog featuring an array of lenses and filters, none of which are compatible with the W100. It's typical of Sony to have a bizarre distribution of features in any given product lineup, but it would seem obvious that the most SLR-like camera should have SLR-like accessories. And W100 owners should disable the Auto Focus Illumination light when shooting people; the blazing red light is great for focusing on inanimate subjects, but could probably be used as a tactical light to blind assailants in a pinch.Overall, the W100 is a remarkable newcomer that truly raises the bar for what you can expect from a point and shoot pocket camera. Novices are accommodated with full automation, and can learn gradually by trying out individual manual functions while other settings remain automatic. And experienced photogs will be right at home with the Manual mode and wide range of settings. Five stars for what is hopefully Sony's work in progress.", "Date": "August 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "W100, my opinion", "Author": "Matt O.", "ReviewID": "RKX9LGEBB0ZHT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well, unlike \"TECHBURN\" I took the time to actually study the functioning of this camera and its capabilities before picking it up. After reading his opinion of the camera, I am left thinking that he did not give this camera much of a chance to become a 'keeper'.After researching many models at [...].One of the first things I learned, from a very helpfull member at dpreview was to get off the AUTO MODE. Don't let the camera decide what to focus on, you decide. I use the auto-program mode and center autofocus or spot autofocus. These 2 focus modes focus on the center of the picture. No more blurry shots do to the camera 'thinking' of what to focus on. Which is 8 times out of 10. Exactly what you wish it didn't focus on.Example, taking a picture of a bird on a tree with auto-focus. It will focus on a branch ahead of the bird. Leaving the bird out fo focus. The auto focus has a bad way of picking the wrongs objects to focus on. The other 2 foucs modes greatly reduce this risk.The second thing to learn is how to hold this camera, and really. ANY small camera. They are small, lightweight and easy to throw out of focus by the slightest movement.You need to hold it with a firm grip. Not so tight its about to break and you have veins sticking out of your forehead. Just firm. Have each hand push the opposite direction and if you are 'twisting' the camera. This helps the camera focus and stay focused exponentially. Use your finger to push the button, don't use your hole arm. Your pictures will thank you.In order to get the best picture quality you will want to practice using three things. Aperture, ISO and the FOCUS!! The aperture will help you get the field of vision, the ISO(which I wouldn't use any over 400 for large picture prints)if some pictures are getting blurry and take it off auto. This is what will kill 90% of your pictures. It may mean you need to learn a bit more of the technicals of photography. But you will be happy you did, Ansel Adams!So far I am very pleased with this camera. It doesn't come with a 16mb card but really, what good is one with a 8mp camera? 2 pictures at its highest resolution? I'd rather have a 64mb built in memory that I don't have to pop in or out of the camera. Its much better in my opinion.Movie mode, eh. What did you really expect? Its a small hand held camera. I wouldn't expect anyone to think of filming their family christmas with a camera. Thats what cam-corders are for. Its like wondering why my camcorder doesn't take razor sharp 8x10 pictures. Its just not hwat they are meant to do. Atleasr not as well as what the other can do.Zoom is as good as any other ultra compact in its price range. You may be lucky to get 4x optical. But again, pickins are slim and will not happen in this price range.Over all it is highly recommended. There is no clear winner out there for the ultra compacts or compacts. So, its not the end all, be all of camera's. But untill then it will make any phtographer or novice happy.", "Date": "May 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sony Has a Winner", "Author": "C. Vincent \"biblegal\"", "ReviewID": "RW1SUS7SQBJBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this little camera recently from Amazon. Thanks for tremendous service and speedy delivery, Amazon.The Sony DSC-W100 is terrific. It is very simple to operate. The menu system is well-organized and easy to understand. Inserting the battery and memory card is a snap. The Zeiss lens system yields incredibly sharp photos even at the automatic setting. The flash is pretty powerful,too! I took some shots in a rather dark restaurant, and the pictures came out really nice and clear. The macro function is superb with crisp, well-defined details at very close range.The powerup time on this camera is fast as well as time between shots. There is very little shutter lag, and you usually get the picture you intended to get. Autofocus can be a little slower until it \"finds\" the target perfectly in certain situations. But this is no big deal compared to older digicams.I like being able to switch quickly from viewing the pictures in replay mode back to camera mode by simply tapping the shutter release button lightly. You are quickly ready for another picture.The camera is not miniature and weighs nearly six ounces, which is not extremely light--but is comfortable to carry or place in purse or pocket.I also have a Canon Digital Rebel XT, and this little camera does take sharper pictures. Of course, you do not have the versatility of the SLR, but it is a great everyday camera to take along with you for all the shots you would otherwise miss. I highly recommend this camera and recommend purchase from Amazon.Update: I have now used this camera in the video mode. WOW. It produces incredibly sharp videos with a fast frame rate that looks terrific on our television. A multi-purpose cable is supplied with the camera that allows USB 2.0 and audio/video hookup. You must decide what zoom level before you start shooting your video because once you start, you cannot zoom in and out. If you have a 1 Gb memory stick Pro Duo you can take about 12 minutes of video. I want to get the 2 Gb Pro Duo stick which allows almost 25 minutes of video. This would be ideal to take along when you want to switch between still and video shots and keep your video shots consistent and consecutive in order. You must use the PRO Duo stick for the high quality (fine) video mode.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "\"The SONY W100 is an overall Winner!!!\"", "Author": "Miguel A. Donida", "ReviewID": "R2TDDPDX2PW6XO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a tech gadget freak, and very particular with the cameras I own. After a long search for looking for the perfect digicam, it is safe to say that for me the Sony w100 is the overall winner!!! I'm a Canon 350D owner and have tried the Sony N1 since my parents have it, and I must say that I would choose the W100 over it in a heartbeat.Before purchasing this camera, I tried out all the cybershot cameras, and a few Canons in the mall. It took me a few hours to finally decide that the W100 is \"THE\" one for me. These were the reasons why I chose the W100...First of all I needed a camera that still has a viewfinder, since I am so used to taking shots with my Digital SLR, I am already quite used to it. Also when under bright sunlight, it is quite difficult to rely on the 2.5 inch screen when taking photos. I like the manual options that are available compared to the other Sony Cybershot point and shoot digicams that I tried.Canon might have the edge here.  I rarely use the AUTO features of the W100, and sofar I am impressed with the results I've gotten with the manual features of this camera. The Macro Mode is cool, but I think the T9 and T30 have better magnifying capabilities.Battery life is pretty decent. Flash power is better than the rest, although red eye is still a problem even when the red eye reduction mode is turned on. Lens is great at F2.8 Aperture, not to mention its a Carl Zeiss. Has ISO 1250 but I must say picture quality deteriorates at this range, noise is too visible here. Realistically, it is only at ISO 800 wherein the noise is not too noticeable.Pound for pound it's a good Low light Camera. This is where the W100 shines, it is priced lower compared to the T30 (7.1 megapixel) and the N1 (8.1 megapixel) SONY cybershot counterparts.  That is why I say the w100 is an overall winner... Try one and I guarantee you won't be disappointed with this pocket rocket camera.Let me end my review with the PROS and CONS of this camera:PROS8.1 MEGAPIXELSCarl Zeiss LensNice Strong Flash64mb Internal MemoryViewfinder1250 ISO2.8 ApertureImage Stabilizer capability as long as there is flashFast, excellent shutter response, very good shot to shot speedFast startup/shutdown timeGood color accuracyVery high resolutionGreat low-light capabilitiesVery capable movie modeVery fast multi-burst mode, great for sports shotsLarge 2.5\" LCD displayLCD is usable in very bright lightBright AF-assist lightDesign is compact but usable, fits the hand wellGood battery lifeImpressive printed output, at ISO 800CONSLook didn't change much compared to the other W series modelsWould've wanted a much thinner bodyFlimsy Battery and Card CoverLack of manual auto white balance options when flash is onLack of other AUTO features like fireworks, etc.Red Eye still visible despite Red Eye reduction mode is onNoisy at 1250 ISOSome trouble with household incandescent lightingRather contrasty default tone curveAnti-noise processing trades some subtle subject detail to hold the noise in checkSignificant chromatic aberration at wide angleSoft corners at telephotoWarm incandescent color balance", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "size, features, price, optical finder and huge flash!", "Author": "funbear", "ReviewID": "RSY0P662PLWI8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lots of good reviews, so I won't be too repetitive, here is the best of the highlights and the small shortcomings...ProsTremendous capability in such a tiny package. (easy shirt pocket)Size and picture quality are the two biggest benefits of this camera.Excellent control capabilityAmazing flash 18ft no problem in wide modemovie mode is good quality and lots of capacityMemory duo is tremendous storage for its sizeoptical finder a huge plus for fash shooting with fixed focusFixed focus setting a big plus for fast candidsLong batter life!Cons (or things I would like to see)No RAW file option (not unique to w100)No 2000 th ss in manual modef2.0 would be worth a small increase in size - not unique w100zoom in movie modeIS will be a huge bonus when it arrives in these high MP Ultra compacts.Slow focus - common amongst tiny digicams.  If an optical finder is important to, which is very nice for bright daylight shots, fast composure with zoom, saving battery..., then this camera is one of the few at 8 MP ultra compact with the optical view finder.  If you prefer using the LCD for composure, then the N1 with its huge LCD screen would be much easier to use, as the type font sizes on the N1 are huge vs. the W100...so if you need glasses to see small text, the N1 might be less cumbersome as you will probably not need reading glasses for fonts this big.  The added cost would be well worth it IMO, as this camera you will not trade up for quite some time....  I marvel something this small can have such amazing photographic capabilities.... in my case, i wanted a camera (in addition to the 15 others I own) to fit in my shirt pocket that I can bring anywhere and have it not be a bother....and the W100 fits the bill perfectly.  If you want an ultra compact, but desire some of the other features such as IS, then you often pay a bit of thickness penalty, often .5\", which makes the camera much less pocket friendly.... hence why the no IS, but with massive flash capability is a nice mix for preventing blur.Update after testing Jul 24/06I have tested the w100 to see how well it performs at both ends of it's fstop range and the full range of ISO.  I have uploaded a jpeg, as you can see in the customer images at the top of this page.  The jpeg shows an \"apples to apples\" comparison for af2.8 ISO 80f5.6 ISO 80f5.6 ISO 1200Having much experience at this, I would have suspected at f 5.6 diffraction would have really eaten into image quality.  F 5.6 on this camera is equal to f22 on full frame 35mm.  However, the image quality was quite remarkable.  Remember, when you zoom, the fstop is no longer 2.8, it becomes f5.6, as the widest.  I can go down to approx f10.  Needless to say, the results were excellent.Next at f5.6 and ISO 1200, I expected garbage... yet the results are surprisingly acceptable... quite impressive results.  Remember these small crops would represent bigger than 8x10, which is really beyond what an 8 MP digicam should be pushed to...so on 4x6 prints, these differences would be barely noticeable.  There was no secondary processing, images were straight out of the camera!Bottom line, as PacoBell pointed out, I would agree this camera is an excellent low light performer as the higher ISO's do not degrade to the extent one would anticipate.  Of course, I would not normally push the ISO past 800, except for extreme circumstances, such as tele mode and very low light where flash is not allowed.  So whether in wide mode (f2.8) or tele mode (5.6) this camera can really perform.  Of course, if you can avoid it, never shoot at higher than f5.6 fstop as diffraction will become noticeably worse...  The camera was designed to fit right into the sweet spot of the aperture diffraction dilemna.Make no mistake though, a good IS system would still gain you about 2 stops of hand holding shutter speed (ss) which is huge, so if you hand hold most of yoru shots, and can get the IS feature in a size camera that suits your needs, by all means, grab those 2 stops of free shutter speed!  In the case of the Sony w100, it's mostly when in very low light and no flash is allowed will ss be an issue and your images may be compromised by hand shake.  In most all other situations, ss should not be a problem.  Each additional feature seems to add size to the camera....", "Date": "July 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sony DSC-W100", "Author": "Beverley A.

It is easy to use and well worth the money.  When my camera arrived, I was amazed at how small and compact it was.  I let my son check it out first and within no time we were both using it. I really love the movie feature.  You can record anywhere and everywhere and the sound is excellent.  My last camera only recorded, but didn't have any sound. It was nothing compared to this Sony.  The 8.1 mega pixels makes the pictures come out great.  My sons and I love it.  They record all the time and take numerous pictures.  I also like that it has internal memory, so if you don't have a memory stick yet, you can still take pictures. The 2.5 inch screen is perfect.  It makes it so easy to get a good shot all the time.  I have had no problems with this purchase at all.  The only thing I would recommend to Sony is to make something that would protect the 2.5 inch screen from getting scratches, just like they do with the optical lens. It is always closed and covered when its not in use. But besides that small detail there, the Sony is a GREAT investment.

Next to my MacBook, this is definitely my favorite gadget.Don't hesitate, you won't be disappointed in purchasing this one.", "Date": "January 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice point & shoot, lacks crisp pictures, somewhat pocket friendly....", "Author": "Shannon Kobashigawa \"shan544\"", "ReviewID": "R1AAMN62P0HW7L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Considering the fact that I got this camera for free via Sony's credit card points, I cannot complain much!Being an amateur photographer, I have a Canon 10d slr 6.1mp.  I absolutely love the camera and my expectations were REALLY REALLY high as the sony boasts its Zeis lens which performs 7 out of 10.  I just wanted an everyday pocket camera with good, clear pictures.This is what I have discovered.  The w100 really shines when there is ample lighting while using ISO 80 in P mode.  I did notice a high amount of noise with indoor photos and some outdoor photos. (Possibly because I was in auto mode and I have been playing around with the settings for a few weeks now).  I also encountered a lot of blurry pictures as well, no matter what settings I used w/o the flash.The reasons why I choose to shoot in P mode are for two reasons.....1.  It overrides the flash outdoors, while sometimes it's necessary, bright outdoor lighting is sufficient enough.  If I want flash, I will just turn it on/off manually.2.  The shutter speed reaction time w/o flash is almost instant w/o the shutter lag.  You get the option to use ISO 80, or any ISO for that matter.  If you are in auto, you have no controls over what settings the camera takes i.e. ISO, flash on/off, etc...  In my humble opinion, ISO 80 produces the 'cleanest,clearest' picture possible.  The higher the ISO the more noise you get.  (Booooooo).Shutter lag is very noticable when the flash mode is on.  A bright orange/reddish light shines on it's subject prior to flashing (red eye).  Here is a little trick.  Sometimes when you want those candid shots, I'll hold the button down halfway, triggering the orange/reddish light, then once it goes away, you press down fully and the camera will shoot almost intantly.  The downside is, you may get the red eye, but you won't be 2-3 seconds late with your picture.  I think you can turn the red eye function off, but going through the menu settings takes too long.Another big difference between the w100 and the w70 besides the megapixel difference is the width!  I really wish the w100 was just as skinny, but I can still fit this camera in my somewhat tight fitting jeans pocket without any problems.I definitely recommend you get a 1gb sd card for a good amount of pictures as well as movie clips without really having to worry about running out of memory.Movie mode is fun to use!  The mic picks up sound well, and the speaker is even better in playback mode.  It's a fun feature.  With a 1gb sd card, you get roughly 14 minutes in tv quality video, 45 minutes in medium quality video.  Not bad at all.For the price range, I would say this camera holds it's own to other camera's in it's 8.1mp class.  When you do get a clear, crisp shot, they come out great and I am pleasantly surprised.  If it wasn't free, I would have looked to the Canon sd600-630 series.  But all in all, I am pleased with this camera and it's abilities to produce moderate to good quality pictures for every day use.", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best camera I own", "Author": "R.

I started off with the 5.1 mega pixel DSCW5 which was GREAT.  I especially love all the preprogrammed settings. After having it for a year I wanted more mega pixels so I upgraded to the 7.2 mega pixel DSCW7.  Another GREAT camera!  Since I live in Alaska I loved the new preprogrammed setting for snow.  After having that for a year I wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse so for 2006 Christmas my husband bought me the 8.2 mega pixel DSCW100.  What a GREAT camera!  The only thing that is a little disappointing is there aren't as many preprogrammed settings.  Other than that is is a really GREAT camera.  We just went to Amsterdam and took both the DSCW7 and DSCW100 and the pictures we took were amazing.  We went to the zoo and aquarium and I took a lot pictures through the glass at the aquarium, they came out fabulous.  There are so good you cannot even tell there is glass between me and the object I took pictures of.  I cannot say enough about how wonderful the sony digital cameras are and how easy they are to use.  The user manual with the DSCW100 is less than satisfactory but for the most part the camera is self explanatory.  The best user manual came with the DSCW5 and the one for the DSCW7 wasn't too bad.  I highly recommend this camera along with both the DSCW5 and the DSCW7.  However both the DSCW5 and DSCW7 are older models and are more bulky.  The DSCW100 is much slimmer and lighter.  I have several friends that have or are going to buy this camera because of the quality of my pictures.

Great for travellers* much greater charging of the flash* quicker time to actually 'take' the picture* excellent new modes:  the ISO mode with blur reduction takes pretty good pics at without a tripod (this was impossible before), and takes AWESOME pics if you use a small tripod.* a button on the camera where you can directly delete (instead of going to a menu)* extended menu options, including a way to have a user defined setting (like B&W;) set to the 'mode' settings on the rotary dial.  Much quicker than the old Sony.* the 'mountain' setting workes really well and has multiple focus zones.  Works much better.All in all, I'm stoked with the device.

I compared the same shots to the canon digital elph sd630. The sony came out sharp and clear as the canon came out just ok.

After taking a picture and looking at the screen you are looking at 275,000 pixels on a 2.5 inch screen. The canon is a 3 inch screen w/ only 173,000 pixels. So that being said, the screen of the sony fools you into thinking the pictures are going to come out just as clear.

I call it a classic because it offers so much that's no longer available in a package so small.  First, the quality of its pictures will rival any DSLR.  The Zeiss optics are superb.  I base this on thousands of photos and many, many hours of Photoshop work and review on a 25 inch monitor.  Second, it offers an optical viewfinder and a very high degree of manual control, neither of which is still available from Sony.  The manual mode on this camera lets you set shutter speed and aperture independently.  (Aperture choices are only two: F2.8 and F5.6.)Of course, the optical finder limits the size of the live view display, and the display is not of the highest resolution.  The display, however, is more than good enough.  The camera doesn't have the stabilization technology of the newer models either.  Otherwise, however, it is a near-perfect compact camera.Since buying the W100, I've invested more than $4K in digital photographic (SLR) gear, but I can't find a better compact camera this side of Leica.  It's that good.  I bought it as my second compact camera for its Zeiss optics.  I doubt I'll ever buy another compact -- not as long as the W100 keeps going.

Instead of the 2-3 day shipping I was expecting, the order took several days to arrive.  I thought I was saving time and money, but probably would have been more satisfied by just going to a local store and purchasing the camera.", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "It's great!

Its fatal weakness for me is that it cannot focus well on distant objects, even when using the fixed infinity focus mode.  I bought the camera as a convenient backup for my 8 megapixel digital rebel.  There is no comparison in the image quality between the two cameras on scenic shots even though they both have the same pixel count.  You won't be able to heavily crop or greatly enlarge scenic shots from the Sony even though this is a big advantage of having the high pixel count image in the first place.  I tried two different cameras of this model with the same results.  I talked with Sony support and, while they tried to be helpful, they were not able to give any suggestions that improved the distant focus situation.

Here and there you do get exceptional shots - but the camera is not consistent and unfortunately most of the shots i took were blurry in automatic mode because even the slightest movement ruins the focus (anti-shake is worthless on this)The shutter speed of the pictures overall was faster than my Sony t1, but considerably slower than a friends Canon SD550. The image processor is loud, and unstable so not the camera if you like to take moving angles.Next night mode and flash are utterly worthless since the night mode even in a well lit new york city street was horribly glim.The ISO mode i will say is a tremendous improvement over previous sony models, and the other only functional update in contrast to my 2 year old Sony DSC-T1.Movie Mode stinks - you cant zoom, sound is poor - but the resolution quality overall is remarkbly good for a camera this size.Concerning the zoom - there has been no progression in the zoom technology here, 3X is really poor considering ultra-compacts such as the casio exlim offer better zoom ratio.This camera wont fit in your pocket (so carrying kit or get used to having your wife lug it around in her purse) the case feels cheap, and light, and despite a bright LCD the the buttons are tiny to press and the battery didnt even last me 90 mins on full charge.End Result - in my opinion this is not a reliable camera, and for $350+ i dont want to risk missing a shot because my hand moved ever so slightly.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "All MP are not created equal", "Author": "Richie", "ReviewID": "R2MGNMDICY5CEB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I love how most people find reviews helpful just because they are positive, even though they might be erroneous or misleading.

Surely people will find the megapixel attractive and nothing else on the camera. When I first came in contact with this thing at the store I play with it for a while and find some of the chracteristic on this thing un attractive.The Design and construction is unthinkable, 8.1 is a nice bargain but the thickness is not. This thing is double what the Sony T7 has to offer. :P Although it's big it doesnt feel that stury like teh Canon SD series... It does feel a bit empty some how and the camera feel as if it's somewhat breakble if i drop it. The screen isnt very impressive for sony's top notch design team. I've sen much better design on their high end T series. So i know they could have done better. What's with the view finder by the way, it got in the way from expanding that 3in screen, without that view finder im sure we could have gotten a nice 3 in screen there.The features on this thing however is somewhat satisfying. With lots of function and picture modes i find that it's quite good for a sony. Although there is nothign else special like canon features with the color accent and swap mode but it does allow lots of manual control over the camera. So who ever is a pro with manual control they can get themself some awsome picture off of this thing. However if you're a newbie to camera, this sucker will toss you off the table with all the fancy dial and menus.I've seen sony at work with their images and i must say the detail and uncomparable. I love the detail but with such high megapixel i do get sandy images. Bigger megapixel doesnt mean beter images but it means sandier images. Try to reduce the megapixel of you're not planning to use all of it, it would give nicer images. The lowlight inhouse shooting will require some adjustment in the manual menu, if you dont manually tune it it will give you DARK pictures yes the sony T series' problems, dark dark pictures. But after soem tuning the image will come out just fine. Although sony boasted a 1250 ISO but i doubted i got that much when i used it. Sorry but it just didnt seem like 1250 ISO to me. Sony T30 got better quality in ISO than this. Basic menu options and advance pictures mode are all there so the image quality is all depend on the user.I find this camera to be fun at first because it got lots of menu for you to kill time on, you can play around with the setting and try to find good setting in certain condition, however, when you seriously need to take a quick picture and require teh right setting, it will be a hassel to get all teh manual setting done by the tiem you take that quick picture you wanted. After a while i get tire of getting into the menu and change settings just to get certain condition images. and the bulkiness of teh camera really get my mood down because there is nothing on this camera i can show off to my friends except the 8.1 megapixel. :P Beside that large chunk of mega pixel, thsi camera is just like other ordinary basic camera with more function to stabilized the 8.1 megapixel.Value of this camera is quite worth it because you wont find a 8.1 megapixel camera deal for this kind of price :) good price for a 8.1 and instead of getting a cheap version of some weird brand, you can now own a sony 8.1 megapixel for just 100 dollar more :) how does that sound? good deal? 8.1 for 300$? DEAL hehhe.Inconclusion i find that this camera is nice if you are more experience with camera, if not this is no newbie camera for it require lots of skills adjusting the manual settings to recieve nicer images. The low features and lack of unqiue function make this camera boring, all you can do is point shoot adjust some images (after a while you'll get mad for changing it over and over again hehe). It's not a very luxury type of camera. Didnt enjoy it for long and the picture are way too big on 8.1 so i only ended up using 6.0 mp on that camera so the 8.1 is there for showing off to buddies hehe. Other than that, the camera is .... plain. The back design is horrible, the dial button will wear out after a while because i've experience it before, where the wheel keep on going without stopping hehe. The design is very out of order, some spot is shave in and soem spot are protruding so it's a weird shape camera indeed. The front is nice however, when you turn on the camera the lens pop out REALLY FAST i think if you put your eye right there it can PUNCH you hehehe.ProblemsOnly problems are that the cap to the battery hub and memory card hub is very flimsy, it feels as iff you will break it if you dont becareful with it so please DO BE CAREFUL with it :) . Also, lack of features for a 8.1 no unqiue functions i should say. Design isnt very eye catching, it only look attractive in advertising pictures after you see it and hold it you get that frown on your face :( Sandy image some time, the high flash it promise you is very limited, you have to adjust the setting like i mention. You are going to be doing lots of setting changing if you are traveling, every light condition is a setting change hehe. If you want to experience it on your own you may but I would say this camera is recommended for advnace users who are careless about unique features, and only want good pictures and high ISO + MP.", "Date": "June 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Shame on Sony", "Author": "Elina \"tough critique\"", "ReviewID": "R2CMS28I186EPL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was looking for a point and shoot camera when I bought this one.
