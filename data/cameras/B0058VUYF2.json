The set up was easy and the wireless reception has a far reach! The only thing I didn't like was that the cameras needed to be plugged into an outlet.

Degnan", "ReviewID": "R104SBXQ0TTE4O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the closest item I can find to the one I ordered. I ordered a 4-camera system (no longer offered) and got a 2-camera system with two additional different model cameras. The different cameras do not work the system properly and make it basically useless as a 4 camera system. I have been trying to resolve this with Lorex for over a month and just keep getting stall tactics. The only thing they are efficient at is taking your money. Trying to get what you paid for is impossible. They keep asking for the same information, which I have sent them at least 5 times. Their tactic seems to be to wear you down to the point you just want to give up. I am looking elsewhere to complete the security system I started. It would be prudent of you to do likewise.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$449.95", "Features": "7\" Lcd Equipped With Built-In Wireless Receiver & Sd Recorder\n3 Record Choices: Motion Detection, Continuous Or Scheduled\nRemote Access Of Camera Capable Via Skype(R)\nDate Stamped Recordings For Faster Event Search\nRecord At Vga Or Qvga Resolution", "Name": "Lorex LORLW2712 7-Inch LCD with 2 Cameras", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BZD%2BVc3wL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0058VUYF2"}}
