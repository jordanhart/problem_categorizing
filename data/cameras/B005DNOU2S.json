This is my first DSLR I wanted a full ready to go kit with everything I need. Since then, I've been educated and learned that you don't need everything here. Best thing to do is do your own research online at DSLR sites and then you will have an idea of what you want to buy. Especially don't by the kit lens. I ended up selling all my kit lens. Yes I spent more money now but I have in my kit a few high end lenses now. In the end I didn't get much of a value since i didn't use these \"extra\" accessories. I have a new camera bag now too. Overall the kit is a good deal if you dont' want to spend any more to have high quality photos. But what is the point of getting a T3i without spending the money for quality lens and accessories?No I would not buy this kit again. Yes I would buy the camera again but only the camera body. I would buy a different camera bag because this can barely fit anything. I would also buy a better tripod also. This one is flimsy but works well if you don't want to spend the money.I recommend this if you are not looking to expand on the hobby and get better quality photos.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera and kit", "Author": "R. Saul Levinson \"DoctorSaul\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZSB48TCB8T0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera package, sold by Willoughby Camera in NYC, is quite a good buy.  All of the essentials (charger, extra battery, case, lenses, etc.) are Canon brand.  The other included stuff is high quality and quite nice.  Willoughby's even included several additional items (a pleasant surprise).  Overnite shipping was uneventful and relatively inexpensive at $49.Regarding the camera, even though I've only had it one day, it exceeds my expectations.  Most of the controls are intuitive.  This is really a good SLR digital for a move up from point-and-shoot camera.  The resultant images are breathtaking in terms of sharpness and exposure (I've been using only the \"automatic\" feature, in that all controls are set automatically by the camera).  As I get to understand the camera better, I'll probably try some \"manual\" settings, but for now there is no reason to rush ahead.  I'm going to use the telephoto lens this afternoon.... can't wait!I am very impressed with Willoughby's.... will probably be ordering more from them in the future.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "better package than most", "Author": "customer1234", "ReviewID": "R1RIA17P5FB7IJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This package contains mostly OEM items, where most have generic stuff.

I had been tracking prices for this purchase since last spring.  Not only was the item exactly as promised, the seller included many, many extras, all Canon brand, and delivered very quickly.  The camera is excellent and I couldn't be happier.

Looking forward to learning more about it.From the purchase experience perspective, Willoughby's via Amazon offered a great experience.  I ordered on Sunday and it was received by Tuesday / Wednesday--at this was at Standard Shipping.  Given I was close by it was still great to receive it so quickly.One of the accessories was not shipped with the shipment but they were very open about stating that it was not shipped along the shipment and will be shipped separately.  Call center was efficient in letting me know the status of the remaining shipment.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005DNOU2S"}}
