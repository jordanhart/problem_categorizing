{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lightweight, easy and fun to use", "Author": "Enche Tjin", "ReviewID": "R10LPMVRQM9P22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic G2 is a successor of G1, which is the first micro four third camera. G series focus on make the camera as small as possible without sacrificing image quality and control. G2 adds video recording  and touch screen feature.Panasonic G2 main specs- 12 megapixel - four thirds sensor- 3\"' 460k resolution swivel and touch screen LCD- 1,280 x 720 high-definition at 60fps- Built-in Electronic viewfinder (1.44 million dots)BODY DESIGNPanasonic G2 weights 371 g / 13.09 oz body only, 593 g / 20.92 oz with battery, memory card and 14-42mm lens. It has dimension of 124 x 83.6 x 74 mm exclude protusion. Compared to regular DSLR camera, The package is significantly smaller and lightweight. Compare to advanced DSLR such as Canon 7D , G2 is approx. half the size and weight. As a result, it is more fun to carry around and it takes only a bit of room to store.Like G1, Panasonic G2 has built-in electronic viewfinder which is helpful for composing photos, the rear 3' inch LCD is also very bright and nice to use. It can also swivel so you can compose a picture in unusual angle for example overhead or very low in the ground.New in micro four third system, LCD screen is now equipped with touchscreen technology. You can touch the screen to select or change various settings and also you can touch the screen to set auto focus point.Therefore, changing AF points in G2 is very fast. In regular DSLR camera, you might need to scroll around until you get AF point that you want. in G2, you just touch it. AF point could be also be enlarged or decreased for precision.HANDLINGPanasonic G2 is nice to hold, thanks to the grip. It also has many dedicated buttons and switches. It has one main dial, camera mode dial, Release mode switch, Auto focus mode switch, metering switch, ISO button, WB button, Function button, AF/AE lock button, display button, delete button, live/lcd button, intelligent auto button, and video recording button.As a result, control and handling is significantly better and faster than many entry level cameras where you need to dwell deep in the menu to change setting that you want.IMAGE QUALITYImage quality in low ISO setting is excellent. However, like all four thirds system camera, image in high ISO is not as good as regular DSLR camera that has APS-C sensor.Image quality from ISO 100 to 800 is excellent. in ISO 1600, image starts to lose some details, sharpness and a bit of saturation. In ISO 3200, image starts to breakdown and 6400 is reserved only in emergency situation.AUTO FOCUS PERFORMANCEG2 is an very responsive camera. It shines in auto focus performance. AF speed is almost instantaneous whether in bright light or low light condition, I feel it can beat some beginner DSLR cameras.  In G2, you can also touch the screen to set up AF point which is very convenient.Auto focus tracking work well in slow moving subject, such as people walking, however, sometimes, it failed to track, especially fast or erratic movement. This is where the area G2 lacks compared to regular DSLR camera.There are plenty to like about Panasonic G2+ Small and lightweight relative to DSLR camera+ Built-in high-res electronic viewfinder+ Touch screen that allow you to change setting, set AF and flip image in playback+ Swivel LCD screen help to compose photos in awkward angle+ Fast Auto focus performance+ Many dedicated buttons and switches+ What you see is what you get (changing color balance, film mode shown in LCD)+ Very good performance (responsive)What I don't like about Panasonic G2- Auto focus tracking is not reliable- Image quality in ISO 1600 and above is not as good as regular DSLR- Harder to achieve shallow depth of field (Defocus background)- 1/2 to 1 second screen freeze after capturing photo- Auto ISO is not very accurate and tend to stick with ISO 400COMPETITORSSamsung NX10 - Digital camera - prosumer - 14.6 Mpix - body only - supported memory: SD, SDHC - noble blackNX10 has bigger image sensor (APS-C) and higher-res (610k) AMOLED screen, however NX10 built-in viewfinder, body handling is not as good as Panasonic G2. G2 also slightly faster in auto focus performance.Olympus PEN E-P2 12.3 MP Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Digital Zoom Lens and Electronic View FinderOlympus E-P2 has a smaller design and more appropriate to be compared with Panasonic GF1 instead of G2. The main advantage E-P2 has is it has built-in image stabilization, however, it falls short in many areas such as slow auto focus especially in low light condition, low res LCD screen, and no built-in flash.CONCLUSIONPanasonic G2 is the best flagship micro four thirds camera in 2010 with many new innovative technology such as touch screen LCD and full HD video recording. It is fun to use and carry around. However, G2 still has the same problem that has plague many four third system cameras which is image quality in high ISO setting. Despite it offers up to ISO 6400, but I recommend user to stick with ISO 800 or lower.Subjective rating relative to mirrorless camera system 2010Image Quality : 4/5 (with 14-42mm kit lens)Features: 5/5Performance: 5/5Body / Handling: 5/5Value for money: 3/5For image sample and iso comparison, please visit my blog.

Yang \"Dragon\"", "ReviewID": "RDOSID7KXPG1L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Many professional websites have quite extensive reviews on the performance of Panasonic LUMIX-G2. As a customer, I think I could offer my experience about the userability of G2.Let me just focus on G2's touch screen. Is it really a feature I would use again and again? The short answer is definitely yes.After owning G2 for two weeks, I invited my brother-in-law who owns a Canon 5D along with a high quality gigantic zoom lens ($$$) to my front yard for shooting some flowers together.Did I use the touch screen to change the setting on the spot? In fact, I did quite many times. The most often used feature was exposure compensation and ISO setting, and a few white balance settings. With the slider and live view, you can decide how the picture would look like. With conventional DSLR, you need to memorize where dedicated buttons are for ISO, exposure compensation and metering method. The truth is that they can not be always at the convenient locations. I found the touch screen a very nice feature because it allows you to make the change so easily. This easiness encourages you to optimize the settings. So, below is my experience of the touch screen:(1) Quick menu: You can access all settings with two touches. To my surprise, the screen is sensitive to my finger nail. There are several icons on the top and the bottom. If you set the shoot mode to be A (aperture priority), the aperture is shown in red which changes only when you change the zoom or turn a dial.  But, everything else can be set really quickly. In the past, when I set the ISO, often I would have cycle through the option several times because I always press the button too quickly. With the on-screen quick menu, you get to see the all options at once.(2) Focus spot: You can touch the object in the LCD screen to determine where you want to focus. Once you do that, if the object moves or the camera moves, the focus spot will try to follow the object. Amazingly, you can change the focus during video recording.(3) Playback: When you review the pictures, the touch screen provides a very intuitive way to scroll, enlarge and pan the view. One thing I like Panasonic G2 is its color fidelity. I can have the picture on the LCD or on my computer look nearly identical to the real object.(4) Release button: You can set it up so that you can shoot by pressing the screen. The camera will first focus to the object you just touched and capture the picture. This feature is very useful when taking the shot at an awkward position, for example, you want to shoot a flower from a hard-to-reach angle. The articulate LCD let you see the composition and by a single touch, the picture is taken. How often I would use this feature? Not very frequent. But, I can see it would not be too rare either.Panasonic has a balanced view about the touch screen. It keeps the simplicity of the operations. It also allows the users to access all setting via buttons. I think this is necessary often times. For example, if you want to delete pictures, you will have to use buttons.Overall, my brother-in-law agreed Panasonic G2 is more fun and more flexible to use because it is much smaller, light weigh and equipped by articulate LCD. This nicety gets you to be in the position to take nice shots. And, the iA button to turn on the auto mode is very well done. When pressed, it overrides your manual setting and a light under the button will lit, telling you its status. Many times, under a urgent situation, I simply let the camera make the decisions for me.On the other hand, the picture quality of Canon 5D is just two notches superior. I still need to perfect my shooting skill with G2. Somehow, I feel the images were not as sharp as they could. I guess more practice would be needed before I finally conclude this.In conclusion, if you wonder the touch screen worth the money, my review is trying to say: yes because it encourages you to optimize your camera to take nicer pictures.Update of user interface on 7/5/2010Before our trip to King's canyon, I gave a 15-minute tutorial to my 18-year-old son on the concept of aperture, shutter speed and ISO using Panasonic G2. When we began to hike, we discussed the object and lighting condition and the possible optimal shooting setting. He could access the control via the touch screen like he has been doing it for a few years. He was practicing photography for the entire trip and seldom let go the camera. The ease of control of the touch screen and the good quality of LCD and EVF for instant replay are very important to the beginners.In the same trip, a daughter of my friend, who just had her 20th birthday, brought her Canon's entry level EOS Rebel XS. She has been using it as a P&S; camera for 8 months. I also gave her a quick tutorial and she got the idea very quick. But, Canon's user interface was a bit difficult to deal with when encountering the scene. It was not straightforward how to adjust the exposure compensation. We eventually figured it out. Yet, many other options were still out of reach.For experienced photographers, the ease of control may not be very important. But, for me, the fact that I got my son interested in photography, is probably worth every dime I paid for this camera, not to mention the camera had produced many outstanding pictures from his first photography trip.My brother-in-law's 5D continued to show its superiority in the entire trip. But, it was apparent that nobody envied him at all, seeing him carrying the big heavy DSLR stuffs.Now, my wife is saying she likes G2 also because it is light and much easier to handle than her Canon SD970 P&S; camera, even though she just uses G2's  iA mode all the time.Update of kit lens on 7/5/2010I went ahead bought the 20mm prime lens and 45-200mm telephoto lens. I was very fond of the 20mm prime lens when shooting at home. But, during the trip, the 14mm-42mm kit lens was the main workhorse. We did change to the telephoto lens a few times. But, the choice of 14-42mm (equivalent to 28-84mm for 35mm film), is excellent for hiking trips. I uploaded several pictures of a lake view in the early morning and night. The ability of seeing the picture before shooting with very high quality in the EVF is essential to take good pictures of the highly contrast scenes. This is the advantage of EVF over OVF. I just love it.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great addition to micro four thirds", "Author": "Dija \"Dija\"", "ReviewID": "R1RNXESGU1OR79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Impressive little camera! Focus very fast and the touchscreen ability is a plus! At first, I thought it was just a marketing gimmick but really adds to the overall experience allowing to change settings faster in conjuction with buttons. My only complaint is that the panasonic's jpeg engine still needs work. That's no problem for me though, because I shoot raw and process them using Lighroom 3. The body's build quality is impresse and feels very sturdy. The lens performs great but feels a little cheap in contrast with the camera body.Great well thought product.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "A joy to use but it could be improved", "Author": "Carol Stee", "ReviewID": "R1MVV0FJX5WFL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Panasonic DMC-G2 for over a month. It's a delight to use, I'm happy with it, but it could be better. I had a big, heavy 35mm SLR that I got tired of lugging around and going out of town to develop film. I wanted to replace it with a compact, light weight camera with a built-in, live-view EVF, and interchangeable lenses, for under $1,000, and I found it all in the G2. Because it's small and light I can carry it for hours without getting tired. The auto focus is quick, which surprised me because I heard M4/3rds cameras focus slowly. The EVF is bright and is good for framing pictures accurately and for when the sunlight makes it hard to see the LCD. The swiveling LCD enables me to shoot pictures at odd angles; I can even turn it outward and forward to take a self-portrait. I can move the focus box anywhere in the frame, increasing it or decreasing it in size, by using either the touch screen or buttons on the back. And with an adapter I can use my old Nikon lenses in manual focus. Each lens weighs at least twice what the camera does (a rough estimate), but I don't mind because Nikon has a wider choice of lenses than are available for M4/3rds cameras at this time.Now, why it could be better.1. It has the same sensor as the one in the G1, not the improved sensor in the GH1.2. The kit zoom isn't as good as the G1's. The G2 has a 14-42mm 3x zoom with a cheap plastic mount, downgraded from the G1's 14-45mm 3.2x zoom with a more durable metal mount.But even without the improvements I mentioned this is a wonderful little camera that I hope to have for years.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "High Dynamic Range Powerhouse", "Author": "DaveBlack", "ReviewID": "RUGTX2HEFU14X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I specialize in real estate photography, which means High Dynamic Range photos - with as many source files as possible - is a necessity. My primary shooter is a Pentax K-7, which will do up to five files at a time and has excellent customization and features. I was looking for a \"back-up\" camera that could possibly do more than five files at a time. I narrowed it down to the Lumix G2 after reading extensive reviews and searching everywhere. In fact, I didn't pay much attention to the other G2 features until I started doing my tests (same house, lighting and scene). And except for a setting mistake that originally limited me to six frames (LONG SHTR NR turn off!) I am now shooting seven frames at a time with a 2/3 stop difference. And the detail, color and vibrance are amazing. I am so pleased I am considering making the K-7 my backup. My ONLY regret is the stock zoom lens only goes wide to 14mm. The Pentax has a 10mm-20mm, which is about as wide as you can go before the \"fisheye\" effect. But I may use the G2 as a primary camera and shoot the ultra-wides with the Pentax. In reality, perfection is not a necessity in this business because the shots have a limited lifetime. Once the house is sold the only use for the photos is to give them to the new buyer so they can show their friends and relatives. But original impact is crucial for marketing. Studies have shown that good photography actually increases the average sales price for mid-level real estate.Another important thing is the G2 can shoot multiple shots in .jpg and RAW - so if I do want to process something for the portfolio or a presentation example, I have it. Try to find this feature on other cameras. Even the K-7 will not shoot multiple RAW and .jpg's at the same time.The other benefit I have found so far is how much usefulness and fun the huge fold-out screen on the back can be. I thumb through the files and check the middle shot for an idea of what the final HDR image will look like and found it really useful. Others can comment also. I recently \"re-took\" a fireplace shot with a lower flame because 7 shots (at the long exposure required) made it look too solid and artificial.Another consideration is whether the 4/3 camera's frame size is a \"reduction\" in quality. I may not be able to settle this argument because the vast number of my shots are always reduced to 1024x680 or so for publication. Many times they are \"minaturized\" even further for the MLS. If you must shoot \"big,\" I would look into that. I'm not qualified to tell you. But if anything, at the size I use, I consider the G2 files to actually be superior in some ways to my other \"bigger\" shots.And you want to talk money? Many high-end Canon and Nikon cameras will do more than three multiple shots, but you pay dearly for that feature. You can use a Promote Control external actuator (as I did with an old Nikon D70s) but you get serious lag times and lens issues - depending on what you are using. Just try to find a low-priced quality camera that will produce multiple quality images like the G2. If you do, please let me know.And by the way, I am not getting paid or acting as a shill for Panasonic. I have come across that in this field and I find it disgusting. There is nothing worse than a reviewer who won't be objective.You'll have to do more research on this camera for your shooting style and needs. But I know one thing. If I ever get a chance to shoot a $5 million house I will take the Lumix G2...", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for a beginner like me!", "Author": "Emilie", "ReviewID": "RB2ONWYHP5U3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first system camera, I've owned it for about two months. I'm a young mom with a young baby, and a point and shoot doesn't do it for me anymore, especially while taking photos of my little one who likes to run around and hide in dark spaces. This camera is just the ticket. It's lighter and smaller than my hubby's Olympus DSLR, so I am able to lug it around with a diaper bag and a toddler in tow. I love tweaking the manual settings, and this camera is packed with it. The touch screen (and the dedicated quick menu button) is awesome. Very useful for making quick adjustments, and with a subject that doesn't stay still, this comes in pretty handy. And I'm really loving the swivel screen, perfect for self portraits and odd angle photography. And when the camera isn't being used, just turn the screen inward so it's protected from scratches. The dedicated iA and movie buttons are really helpful too (although I never use iA myself, the rest of my family don't know how to use this camera and that's where the iA button comes in). I'm very satisfied with the images this camera produces. I've just recently learned to tweak it enough to produce sharp, crisp, bright and vibrant images that sometimes I hardly need to do any post processing.I don't mind it not having an in-camera stabilization.. aside from the kit lens, the only other lens I use it with is the Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras that lacks image stabilization, but I hardly get any blurred photos because that particular lens is very fast. I'm not so sure how this camera performs with other lenses.Two things that I think may be improved:1. The lens mount does feel plasticky, compared to other DSLRs I've borrowed, but it seems pretty sturdy.2. Above ISO 800, I see a lot of noise.If you are a mom like me looking to take great pictures of your kids, and like to mess around with manual settings (because this camera is complicated -- at least from a beginner's perspective), I'm pretty sure this camera will suit your needs, and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Keeps getting better", "Author": "Quigdaddy", "ReviewID": "R3IP7KWTS5HD3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited 7 years for DSLRs to get small enough to be usable for me.  It didn't happen.  Then Micro 4/3 came along.  It's not really fair to compare this camera to entry level DSLRs because their functionality and performance is typically deliberately hamstrung by the manufacturers, who need to entice buyers with extra features that justify the price of the high-end models.  So the Panasonic is smaller than the smallest entry level DSLR, but with the features of much more expensive models that weigh 2-3x as much, like HD video with autofocus.Out of the box, the drawbacks were ease of use, low-light quality, and autofocus speed.  Ease of use because I was accustomed to the Nikon/Canon interface and had to adjust, but as others have mentioned, the touch-screen actually improves performance by enabling really quick adjustments.  Low-light quality and autofocus were mainly hindered by the kit lens, which is decent but not great.  For indoor shooting, get the 20mm lens and you will seldom need a flash or need to adjust ISO.  It takes great pictures of motion in poor light, like my kids as they leap from the furniture after dinner.  For video, the 14-140 lens, while expensive and heavy, focuses as fast as a dedicated high-end HD digital camcorder.  So the kit itself is worth buying over a DSLR but add a couple of good lenses and you will never look back.The bottom line is this: 95% of the people who buy mid-range DSLRs like D90/D7000 ought to be buying a Micro 4/3 instead.  Nothing against Nikon and Canon, they make fantastic cameras, but you can get the features that 95% of us rely on in a package half the size.Pros: small, light, awesome image quality.Cons: expensive body, expensive lenses.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-G2 with 14-42mm Lens", "Author": "Bob Travaglione \"Bob Travaglione\"", "ReviewID": "R1KQWVX9TACIR9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera was easy to learn to use.  I do like the auto bracket feature as I learn the exposure characteristics of the new machine.  I wish I could have bought just the camera body.  The lens that came with the camera really is too limiting for a zoom and I am not impressed with a plastic lens mount on the lens.  There should be other lens & camera package options that you can choose.  The LCD screen was nice and bright and I enjoy it's flexible viewing positions.  The built in viewfinder was nice and bright and easy to manually focus with.  The camera was very user friendly with the quick movie button to start the video mode quickly and spontaneously.  The video quality was excellent.  As far as still image quality,  the JPEGs did have a lot of noise in them and the color was not as lush and rich as I hoped.  But by shooting the combo JPEG / RAW, I found the RAW images when processed with the included Silkypix Software really saved the day.  I was able to achieve very nice depth and colors with the RAW.I primarily am using the 20mm F/1.7 lens which is the best possible lens to use with this camera, allowing some very silky smooth blurred backgrounds and excellent sharpness where needed.  The lens is wonderfully light and small and makes the viewfinder even brighter.  I also am using the Panasonic 14-140mm zoom lens.  This lens has it's place for a lot images that require the tele effect and the images are usually very sharp.  The color is good but not at all as intense as the Pany 20mm lens.  I am hoping that Panasonic will come out with a constant aperture lens for this camera that is in the zoom range of 12-70mm with a constant aperture of at least F/4.

Solomon \"Steve Solomon\"", "ReviewID": "R2XNVEAU39DKKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I acquired the Panasonic Lumix G2 for travel and stock imaging. So far, I am most impressed with many aspects of this m4/3 system camera, including the following: build quality, portability (size/weight), ease of use, array of customizable settings, full manual control, super high-def EVF, high-res LCD display, responsiveness, and overall system components, especially lenses! Although AF speed is pretty quick, I probably would not want to shoot the Olympics with it. For what I shoot (products, landscapes, nature, macro), it is near perfect. If I had to nitpick, I could say that a PC Sync socket for us studio shooters would be handy. Also, having the self timer control on the same dial as the exposure/bracket modes means that you cannot use, say, auto-bracketing and the self-timer at the same time. However, don't worry...there is a workaround: Use a remote shutter release (i.e., Satechi MA-D1)! That frees up your exposure/bracket mode dial. As for image quality, I would say that it is much better than any point and shoot or compact camera in terms of noise, sharpness, tonality and dynamic range. However, as most reviews suggest, it is probably just shy of an APS-C sensor system in overall image quality. But in terms of portability and ease of use, I really think it is superb! I did make a 16x22 inch custom print from the G2 with the 14-42 kit lens, and it came out quite sharp, detailed, and with good dynamic range. (It was shot on a tripod at ISO 100, using the aforementioned shutter release.) The Lumix 20mm pancake is even sharper, and a sweet travel lens, albeit with no optical image stabilization.

The swivel LCD, fast autofocus, HD Video and above all, the compactness of the camera and reduced sizes of the lenses (thanks to micro 4-3rds) puts this camera above the others I have seen.When I compared the looks of this camera with other cameras on the internet, the pictures do not do justice to how cute this thing really is. You have to hold it in your hands to realize how sweet this cameara is and I guarentee that you will instantly fall in love.I have also given due consideration to the APS-C based mirrorless designs. My hummble openion is that there is no value in just reducing the size of the body by eleminating the mirror and the prism.

I took hundreds of pictures -- inside cathedrals, outside of scenics and old castles, night shots, portraits, high dynamic range bracket shots, etc etc. This camera allowed me to get the best pictures I've ever taken, and I've been using SLR's since I got a Pentax Spotmatic in the 70s. The touch-screen interface, coupled with the easy-to-use and well thought out physical buttons, made adapting to the situation (for instance, underexposing a bit to get the proper mood in a cathedral's sanctuary) a breeze.It reacts very quickly, so I didn't miss any opportunity shots. The image quality (I shoot RAW) is superb. If left on P mode or IA mode, the decisions it makes almost always result in the shot I want, and if I want to tweak it a bit (as mentioned above), it's quick and easy to do.Both the LCD and the viewfinder are extremely bright. I typically use the viewfinder (old habit, maybe) and use the LCD for its touch screen capabilities, either to quickly change settings or to touch where I want the focus point to be.

But to be fair, most dSLRs probably have the same limitation.I was an advanced amateur in the film days and an early convert to digital photography, but this is my first serious digital camera. I waited for a digital equivalent of my favorite camera, the Nikon FM-2 (compact, full manual control), but it never came. I even hoped to use my manual focus lenses again, but Nikon abandoned me - none of their entry dSLRs meter with AIs lens.I finally got the G2 after finding a Nikon to M4/3rds adapter. Guess what? It works! Not only does it meter with AIs lenses, but I can even use aperture priority auto-exposure mode. That was more than I expected. The hi-res LCDs and digital tools make manual focusing easy. I've finally found my digital FM-2 - Thank you, Panasonic!BUILD: Compact, but not too small. Plasticy compared to film cameras, but still feels well made. All new lenses feel cheap to me, however (compared to my old AIs).PERFORMANCE: I'll let the other reviews cover this in detail (DPReview does a great job), but it has all the automatic features I'll ever want, auto focus seems plenty fast to me, and shutter lag is minimal.RESOLUTION & SHARPNESS: Again, DPReview covers this better than I can, but in short, image quality isn't quite up to film standards yet, but it's not bad. I set up my old lens-test target and took several shots with the kit lens and a 35mm Nikkor. I felt the 12 megapixel sensor didn't have enough resolution to fairly judge the results, but overall I'm pleased. It's a lot better than my old Canon S3IS (6 mpix) and my outdoor shots look terrific.CONTROLS: Very intuitive; quick learning curve. ...Just lots to learn. The touch-screen compliments the mechanical controls nicely. I was even pleasantly surprised by the depth-of-field preview button (which also displays the shutter speed effect).TOUCH SCREEN. Wow. How did I ever get by without one?LCD & ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER: Excellent. The LCD is high resolution (460k) and the EVF is triple that (1,440k). No problem using a polarizer. EVFs have their drawbacks compared to SLR finders (in bright light, slow refresh rate, etc.), but they have advantages too (more compact, light amplification, conveying information, digital focusing aids, etc.). Plus they keep getting better. IMHO, this is the future of photography and mechanical SLRs will fade into history.ARTICULATED LCD: A must-have. It easily lets you get down to bug eye level or held high to shoot over crowds. Swings around if you want to see yourself in the picture, or face-in for protection.MANUAL FOCUSING: Manual control is important to me. Many people judge cameras on how fast they auto-focus, but I take the time to compose a picture (I still miss depth of field scales). The G2 has excellent auto and manual focus control. The touch-screen and digital zoom-in focusing tools are amazing and make focusing easy and accurate. And it works with old MF lenses too (with an adapter). For more details, see the video review I posted. (You can also find it on YouTube by searching for \"pady.g2\")IMAGE STABILIZATION: I won't fully appreciate this until I get a telephoto lens. However, I wish Panasonic used sensor-shift stabilization (like Olympus) instead of optical. Theoretically that makes lenses more expensive. Plus I'm curious if sensor-shift works with AIs lenses.VIDEO: I love adding video clips to my digital slideshows. However, I haven't tested it yet. I'll post updates as necessary. The G2 does not have full HD, but it has \"HD Lite\" and VGA & WVGA @ 30fps.BATTERY: This is the one serious drawback. I camp in national parks and often don't have electricity for days. Panasonic does not offer a car charger, additional batteries are way too expensive, and cheap third party batteries may or may not work. This is almost unforgivable and nearly forced me to get the Pentax K-x, which uses cheap, available, rechargeable AAs. The only solution I found is a 12v-110v power inverter, but now I have to lug that around too.CONCLUSION: The G2 renewed my interest in photography. I wish it used AA batteries and had an APS-C sensor & sensor-shift stabilization, but the pros far outweigh the cons and I would buy it again. I prefer EVF to SLR cameras, and this is my pick of the litter.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "the perfect hybrid", "Author": "Laura J.

After using the G2 for several months, I have mixed feelings about this camera system.Cost is a definite plus; I paid less for the G2 and 14-45mm lens than you can buy the new G3 body-only.  Also, I want to have immediate access to controls for aperture setting, exposure compensation and ISO setting and the G2 provides that. 12MP is plenty of resolution. For size - both camera and lenses - it's perfect.Negatives are the shutter lag, slow focusing of the 45-200mm lens, and percentage of shots that are not sharp. I might be getting 8/10 shots that are sharp, but the other 20% are real annoying.I think my in-focus success rate is due to the G2's relatively poor high ISO performance, combined with slow lenses (the zooms are f/3.5 or f/4 wide open).  I keep the ISO down to get a clean image, but then the slow lenses don't give you a high enough shutter speed to keep the image sharp when shooting hand-held, even with image stabilization.I'll probably try the GH2 instead.  Why not the G3?  The G3 doesn't have the manual controls and DxO's sensor test results show that the GH2 is better than the G3 in all areas except high ISO performance, and even there it's very close.Updated on 04Oct11:  after reviewing out-of-focus images,I found that all have occurred when using the 45-200mm lens.  So, I did a quick test to find the slowest shutter speed that I could use and reliably get sharp images when shooting hand-held.  The result varies with focal length:  1/125s at 100mm, 1/200s at 150mm and 1/320s at 200mm.  And this is with image stabilization turned On.  Since the maximum aperture also increases with focal length, to get a shutter speed of 1/320 means you either need good light or you need to crank up the ISO, which is problematic for this camera.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC-G2", "Author": "Davets", "ReviewID": "R345JY3UFL7PAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm upgrading from an old Olympus 4MP 3X zoom.  Some of my impressions are probably affected by the big changes in technology since I got it about 8 years ago.  This camera is everything I've read about and more.  I haven't purchased anything this costly online before without actually seeing and trying it first.  I have handled Panasonic super zooms owned by relatives (FZ50, FZ8, FZ28).  I'm glad I took the leap!I've had the camera since the week before Thanksgiving.  I looked for months before deciding on this camera.  Since there are lots of detailed reviews already, I will just say that the kit lens produces sharper photos than I expected from the reviews.  I really liked Olympus' color and was concerned about some comments about the color from Panasonic.  Nothing to worry about.  The colors are very natural and bright.  The only reason for 4 stars on the interface is that the options are so extensive, it can be a bit overwhelming at first.  The menu is laid out in a logical fashion so once you know what you're looking for, it's easy to find.  The viewfinder is outstanding.  The manual focus works well - especially on my manual lenses (see my review of the Rainbow Imaging Pentax-K adapter that I purchased for use with two old lenses).  The camera is small but very solidly built and easy to hold.  My night and low light shots are also better than I had expected based on comments and reviews.  I'm hoping that Micro four thirds lens prices will eventually come down.  I'm glad I purchased the G2 instead of the G10 - the rotating LCD, high resolution viewfinder and 720P video are worth the extra cost.  The start-up speed is very fast - by the time I get my eye to the viewfinder I'm ready to shoot.  Autofocus is fast and the touchscreen focus feature is really useful.  I have a class 10 SDHC card so there's only a short wait for shots to be saved.I would definitely recommend the G2 to anyone looking for a smaller interchangeable lens camera at a reasonable price.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kit lens unsuitable for video recordings", "Author": "wildsunflowers", "ReviewID": "R2GQD1XRCW02R2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am returning my second replacement  of Panasonic Lumix G2. Although I love the camera, I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the provided kit lens. I had hoped that the replacement cameras would come with the lens from possibly another production butch and would perform better. As it turned out the second  and third lens was equally bad as the first one. As much as I am satisfied with the camera's performance for still photography, the kit lens is totally unusable for video recording  because of the noise generated while zooming, which is clearly detectible in the audio of the recording. In my case the noise was not generated by the focus motor, as some people seem to have experienced, but it appears to be caused by mechanical internal rubbing of the lens body tubes and it is much louder than the focus motor noise. Adding to the problem is the jerkiness of the lens operation when zooming, especially after 32mm, which results in uneven video recordings and makes them look worse then amateurish. I am very disappointed that Panasonic chose to insist to sell an otherwise superior camera with such an inferior lens.  My hours of phone consultation with Panasonic customer service did not offer any solution whatever. I wish it was possible to purchase the camera body only and then obtain a better lens separately. My recommendation is if you intend to use the camera also for video recording, be prepared to dish out some more money for a better lens.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love my G2", "Author": "Usually Pleased", "ReviewID": "R2B61K47BWNVI6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The G2 is a great camera, capable of producing stunning photographs under the right conditions. When light is low, the performance is poor.Having had the camera for a year, and being able to compare it's performance to the Canon 40D under identical circumstances, as well as a number of point and shoot cameras, including the Canon G10 provides the basis for this review.Armed with a range of lenses, including the a couple of primes (the Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras and the Olympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 45mm f/1.8 Lens for Micro Four Thirds Cameras) and some a couple of zooms (Panasonic 45-200mm f/4.0-5.6 Lumix G Vario MEGA OIS Zoom Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic and Olympus Micro Four Thirds Cameras and the Panasonic Lumix 100-300mm f/4.0-5.6 G Vario Aspherical MEGA OIS Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras) as well as the Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0 Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic Digital SLR Cameras, makes it possible to see what this camera can achieve. The 14-42mm kit lens produces such poor photos that I don't carry it.Being able to easily carry such a broad range of lenses everywhere, toting them while travelling, and then getting really great shots is why I love this camera. Taking photographs of birds or low light shots of classroom activities is where this camera fails. For wildlife, the camera does not focus fast enough to take tack sharp photos consistently. Sure it's possible to get a couple, but with the 40D I get many more. The low light photos even with the really good Olympus lens do not allow for a fast enough aperture speed to avoid badly blurred photos due to subject movement. The real problem is that above and ISO setting of 200 the noise becomes unacceptable - even after working on them with Lightroom.The G2 is better than the Canon G10, so if you're moving up from point and shoot, this a good option. If I were buying now, I'd probably get the Panasonic Lumix GH2. The GH3 is missing the manual controls that I find so appealing on this camera. The 4/3 camera that seems to be worth waiting for is the Olympus OM-D E-M5.Lenses to consider - definitely the Panasonic 20mm and 100-300mm, plus the Olympus 45mm.

Like everyone else has written, once you've played with the touchscreen it seems like such an obvious interface it's amazing that it hasn't been on the scene before...and I'm sure that in another 2 or 3 years it will be standard on all digital cameras. Also love the viewfinder...sorry, but for me the view screen isn't as good at isolating the picture! To sum up the good: interchangeable lenses, touchscreen, viewfinder, light but powerful.  The not-so-good: feels as though they've packed it with so many options that managing the essentials gets a little lost in the forest of choices.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Alternative for heavy SLR's", "Author": "arun", "ReviewID": "R17TTD8NYU2KPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is lighter in weight and smaller in size compared to SLR's and navigation of functions and settings are easy.

I showed my wife how to use that, and now she can take good photos all the time.

You're paying extra for the form factor basically.Low light scenes can be difficult to capture properly - DSLR's could do better, but then again this is a different genre all together.Overall:If you're looking for a non-point-and-shoot that will take excellent photos, large enough photos for displaying on your 40\" TV, printing onto canvas, etc; and you're not wanting to spend $1000+ on all the big bulky gear of a full DSLR, then this is the style camera you want. Spend $400 on a used one of these, then in a few years if you're looking to grow, just simply buy a new lens and work with that.

The EVF seemed to be a little bit laggy when shooting at night, but I'm not 100% sure.I'm not 100% satisfied with the camera just because there's no built-in stereo sound for video and comparing to superzooms, there's no high-speed video.

I'm a beginner at photography stuff so my review is far from professional, heck I don't even know what some of those buttons are for yet. But I've noticed a few things right away:1. The touch screen focus is a really great option. Most full DSLRs can't do this.2. The feel of the camera is really nice compared to the larger DSLRs, it fits into my hands perfect.3. I noticed, like others, the problem with auto focus not working properly in low light conditions and also in a sunset where I'm trying to focus on the sky.  I just decided to switch the focus to manual in these situations. But otherwise, the focus is extremely fast. Mind-blowing compared to a little point and shoot camera that I've been carrying around for a decade.4.  Some of the menu options are kind of deep. Like I haven't been able to find a manual setting for the ISO yet.5. I've read several reviews where people are complaining about the quality of the lenses. Well, I notice the pictures look a heck of a lot better than my little point and shoot camera. The colors are much more vivid and edges are much sharper. So I guess I'm just not sophisticated enough to notice \"softening at the edges\" as some have put it.Most of this is just a problem of reading the manual carefully and taking classes in photography to up my IQ in the DSLR world.Bottom line is that this is an excellent first DSLR and I would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the price", "Author": "Joshua Samuelson", "ReviewID": "R1OZKZAX7FIYQB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Good:I'm very pleased with this camera.  It's really easy to use and takes great photos.  I usually shoot in full manual or aperture priority mode, which are pretty simple to control.  The one feature that really surprised me was the intelligent auto mode.  I didn't think I would use it, but it's great to have when you're in manual mode and what to take a quick photo of something.The kit lens is pretty good too.  I got an adapter so that I could use some of my film SLR lenses, but I find that I use the kit lens 95% of the time.The tap to focus (or whatever it's called) is pretty cool too.  It's a bit like the iAuto mode.  I don't use it much, but it's really nice when you want to capture a moment before it's gone.Actually the touchscreen in general is a huge plus on this camera.  I've always hated having to futz through menus with a 4 way button, especially when I know that I'm missing a shot because of it.  The touchscreen really speeds all of that up.The Not so good:For me, the Electronic viewfinder is almost useless.  It's not really a problem of this model, I just think EVFs aren't that great.  I sometimes use one of my old manual focus lenses with an adapter and it's very hard to get it in focus, so if you're serious about using old lenses you might opt for a full SLR instead.  If not, I would get one of the other micro 4/3 cameras without an EVF.  I would give this 5 stars if it didn't have the EVF.The one other annoyance I have is that the camera doesn't seem to auto adjust ISO.  I'd like to be able to set Aperture and Shutter and have it compensate for light via auto ISO.  It looks like it's supposed to do that but it never seems to work right.

I love the look, and feel of it. I wanted a step up from my point-and-shoot, and I had a canon rebel for a short time. I could not get over the size and weight of a traditional DSLR. They are huge, bulky, and heavy. I am a girl, it needs to fit in my handbag thank you very much! But I still wanted more creativity, more manual options, better performance in low light, and a better picture quality than a point-and-shoot can offer. The new micro four/thirds interchangeable lens system seemed the ultimate compromise. The lumic g-2 looks exactly like a traditional DSLR, but shrunken down. It is significantly smaller and lighter than a DSLR, but also significantly larger than a point-and-shoot. It will fit in a good mid-size hand bag, but you can't toss it in an evening clutch or something. I am very pleased with the image quality. The size of the sensor of the G2 is much larger than that of a point and shoot, and only marginally smaller than a traditional DSLR. This makes for outstanding pictures, especially in low light conditions. The camera has a swivel lcd screen, can be operated fully automatic, or fully manual. As beautiful as the camera is, for me the drawback is the complexity of the camera. I still don't really know how to use all the options. if you are a point-and-shooter looking to upgrade, be prepared to sit down with the manual and really learn this camera. If not, u can still just point and shoot with this camera, but still have better pictures than with a point and shoot. Plus, you will have unbelievable bragging rights.

We purchased this camera and I actually liked the camera, but 14 months later the shutter broke on the camera (this is what will open up to allow a person to take a picture).  Since it was 14 months we were out of the year warranty so I took it to a local camera salesman who sells Canon and Nikon told me to contact Panasonic b/c in his experience with Canon and Nikon customer service is that close to warranty date they will still do it free or really knock down the price. When I talked to customer service and explained the situation, the rep told me that nothing they could do because out of warranty and would just have to fix it.  I was given an estimate of $275 to fix, but told me the estimate is always high and it will always be much lower. I told him no thanks as that would be to much and would go another route, but before I hung up he stopped me and said he would talk to his supervisor and try to lower the price. He came back on and said they put in for a lower price which is ALWAYS given and it would bring it to around $200 or less, so I agreed and sent it in.Couple weeks later repair service calls and said before they look at it or fix it I have to pay $325. When mentioned the estimate and customer service putting in for lower price, he said he had no idea what I was talking about as they just have a FLAT RATE OF $325 for out of warranty no matter what it is so not sure where the estimate came from or the price reduction.  So we had them send it back.We called customer service again and talked to them about the situation and even talked to a supervisor about it, and how we were talked into sending it in, the supervisor said they could do nothing about it, they wouldn't even stand behind themselves about telling us the price would be low to $200, even when they have a flat rate of $325.We were very upset at customer service for number of reasons, mainly that they were lying about price to fix.  We were upset that they wouldn't work with us on having it fixed but we decided to be okay with it, but when the customer service man talked me into sending it in and the price would be much lower was an absolute lie! (Remember the repair center said anything out of warranty is a flat rate of $325, they don't do estimates.  While talking to customer service the last time, we looked up results about their customer service and found many complaints and problems.So while the camera is nice (when it works) the pain of ever having to deal with customer service is not worth it.

It is a lifetime worth of memories that our minds do not take into account without a reminder. A picture is there to jog your memory of that one time you could not stop laughing or of that one time you got together with all of your family. Just by looking at the photo, you get a replay of what happened at that moment. The camera is there to help you keep all those memories. There is a variety of different types of cameras; from big to small, from thick to thin; and from touch screen to old school. The Panasonic Lumix G2 14-42 mm is a camera that is up to date with technology. It has a flip-and-twist touch-screen, but you can also use the buttons so you are not stuck on that, just in case you are not a big fan of technology. It is also easy to handle and change the retractable lenses. It is small enough that you do not get tiered of taking pictures but big enough to show off to all your friends. Many other cameras are expensive because it can take high quality photos, but the Pasonic Lumix G2 has many of the qualities that the others do.  It can take breath taking photos out in the wilderness or even take a beautiful portrait of your family and of yourself. It has four different levels of \"intelligent exposure\" so you do not have to settle for one. It is known as the speed king because of its fast photo taking quality; it can take each photo under 0.9 seconds. Intended also for the manually oriented shooters, it has one of the best designs yet. You will not be limited; you can be speedy Gonzalez or the slow tortes who won the race because either way you are still going to get a great photo. The Pasonic Lumix G2 has a camera recorder so you will not have to buy one. It was replaced with the on and off auto intelligent button from the previous camera \"G1\" which was also heavier. With the recorder you have full control on the movie making settings with the peripheral focus. The movies come out with a \"High Definition\" view.  One of the best deals would have to be here on amazon.com. Not only is the shipping free but you are also getting to save money. You would save approximately two-hundred dollars. Not many places could save you that much money, and if you buy it used it comes out a lot cheaper. Although for your own safety it would be best to buy it new so you do not risk anything. You can use the left over money on something else you may need or want. A photo album would not be a bad idea because you cannot keep all your photos on a computer or camera. Print them out and save them. Have fun with the photos; cut, design, and share them with everybody. It is not just a camera but a memory holder, bringing more than just a \"clicking noise\" but a way of bringing your memories back to life. You will want to take your camera everywhere especially to hikes, family reunions, or even just a simple visit to a friends house. It is not a waste of money because you cannot relive that moment; think of it as a way of investing in something you can keep forever.

My only disappointment has been with the included software for downloading, editing and sharing images. The program runs excruciatingly slow. But I was particularly annoyed with the fact that I had to download and use Windows Live Mail to email pictures. Which also forced me to get a hotmail account. I'm sure I can find a different interface for this functionality, and that's an inconvenience I really shouldn't have to endure. But all-in-all, we have been very happy with this camera and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to venture beyond the point-and-click camera.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good little camera", "Author": "Enrique Martinez", "ReviewID": "R1M31VD2S2E9RW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OKay but seriously. Sorry about my video review. I was just jerkin around. anyway this is a good little camera. If youre loking for a simple to use point and shoot camera...then youre probably not reading this and you already picked up your camera at target. This camera does have auto presents so you can just point and shoot. and it also has a rather complex menu system with the ability to make many different adjustments. It'll take some time of reading through the manual to truly understand how to work this camera. But it produces great results. pictures are crisp clear goos color etc etc. no complaints really. well okay one complaint. And that is the \"noise\" from when you take a picture in a darker atmosphere, but I think that is a common problem with digital cameras. There is a noise reduction feature on this camera that you can use but honestly I haven't tried it out. there's just so many options to play with with this camera that I've barely scratched the surface with it. Anyway I think this is a good starter camera if youre interested in getting into digital photography. that's why I got it and i'm happy with my purchase. toodles.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "Paul Fountaine", "ReviewID": "RI7BA5IT2JQ57", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I currently own a Nikon S8000 & a D90, and have owned a Canon DSLR and Sony alpha DLSR, so I am familiar with digital cameras.I need a lightweight quality camera, and the G2 sounded like the perfect solution.The viewfinder is digital - and here in lies the problem.
