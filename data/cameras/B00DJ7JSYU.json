But it can't be denied that you're getting the same sensor as the cameras costing many times this little guy, and the low light ability of it is arguably unrivaled.When looking at the competitors, there's really nothing that's similar. You have the FS700 which is a nonstarter for me due to its ungainly form factor. DSLRs work great, but lack basic things that professional video cameras such as this have, namely XLRs, proper monitoring, and built in ND filters.I do have my nitpicks, so i'll rattle them off:-The LCD is in the wrong place, should be farther forward, and cannot turn to face forward.-The EVF is not very good at all, but i'll take a mediocre EVF over no EVF at all. I use it frequently, and a large eyecup helps a lot.-No true 1080 slow motion, the 60i isn't terrible by any means, but if you want good slow motion, it's just not quite there.-The darn thing is just a half an inch too large in all directions to work with nearly any of the great photography cases out there.-LCD screen reflective, not great in sunlight. Sony's lcds for the longest time have had amazingly visible lcds in sunlight, what's wrong canon?I could go on, but it's really nitpicking. The plusses far outweigh the minuses:-Unrivaled low light up to 20,000 ISO. And yes it's USABLE up to 20K, not that you should, but you can if really needed.-Small formfactor, with all the expected video necessities. Can handhold it all day long no problem-Practically zero artifacting. No Moire, no alaising, true 1080 sharpness.-Battery life that makes RED shooters weep. Nothing against red, it's just Canon gave us a small, 4 hour battery.-The AVCHD codec is NOT weak. It holds up great, the only exception being high motion scenes such as water or leaves in the wind.-Uses any Canon or Nikon lens(with adapter)again, i could go on, but it's just a lot to list out. If your in the market for a camera in this price range and this form factor, you'll be thrilled with using this little chap, i have zero regrets from nearly a year of use.if i were to have one wish, it would be for canon to take a damn hint from sony and make a powered, constant aperture zoom lens.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Cinema Camera for the Price | Big upgrade for Video DSLR users", "Author": "Sherwin", "ReviewID": "R1SR5WAEIC5U7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is one of the best cinema cameras in this price range (currently $4999).  If you are a documentary filmmaker, event/wedding videographer, or a dSLR filmmaker that wants to upgrade to a video camera, the C100 would be a great option.I was initially, unimpressed with the camera when it came out.  The specs were decent but it didn't offer anything extraordinary, and then coupled with the initial price, it didn't seem like a camera worth purchasing for most.  However, the main attraction of this camera was the sensor: a 4K sensor that outputs a 1080p image onto SD cards.  So I rented this camera for a few projects and was completely surprised with what I got out of it.  I eventually bought it and have used it for over 6 films in the span of 8 months.  Still learning the ins and outs of the camera and working to squeeze the best possible image from it, but so far, I am truly loving this camera for my projects.Despite the lack of some important features (lacks higher than 30fps frame rates, low bitrate AVCHD, poor EVF, limited LCD articulation), the image quality that you get out of it is really superb and coupled with its form factor, XLR inputs, ND filters, dual SD card slots, and low-light capability, it makes for a great documentary or event camera.  Although, I did note that the AVCHD had a low bitrate, that does NOT mean it's a terrible codec.  It is great for 90% of the work I do.  There are times when I would like to have a better codec right inside the camera.  That's why another great benefit to this camera is that you can output to an external recorder for a higher bitrate in a less compressed codec.If I were looking for a camera that had the BEST possible image quality at this price range, I wouldn't go for this.  You can get a much better image from something like the Blackmagic cinema Camera for significantly less.  But if you need a great low-light, ergonomic camera that can do audio and picture REALLY well, this is one of the few cinema cameras at this price point.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$8,999.00", "Features": "Super 35mm 8.3MP CMOS Sensor\nEF Lens Mount with EF Contacts\nBuilt-in ND Filters with Manual Controls\nTwo XLR Audio Connectors\nHDMI Outputs an Uncompressed Signal", "Name": "Canon EOS C100 Cinema EOS Camera with 24-105mm f/4L Lens", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510NacH19YL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DJ7JSYU"}}
