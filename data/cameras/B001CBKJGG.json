I bought the rebel XS and after days of dirt testing this camera I've found it a beautiful experience.  Now I'm a professional videographer attached to a tv station in Trinidad & Tobago, my purpose for this camera was the need for a quick sharp still shot camera that would be impressive under low light and still capture impressive portrait shots to be used for my website and for large prints. I didn't want to shell out over a $1000. US for a camera body.  What is tagged by Canon is true: The full auto mode is truly accurate and gives excellent shots always, it makes photography so easy for a beginner or intermediate. The portrait mode isn't  blurry, images are clean, nicely toned, excellent in quality for large size prints. The P ( program mode) I like alot at first because this mode sets exposure so nicely I found it addictive. I shot alot of  night pics of cars on a freeway, with bright, sharp, lively colours emerging. Night pics at 800 iso had  very very very little noise, and I mean I was searching the pics on 15\" monitors for reason to complain, but was really impressed.  The auto focus is really quick. Th XS comes with \"only\" a 7 point auto focus system compared to the XSi 9 point, forgive me when I say there may be no need for another 2 points when the camera focusses so quick and so accurately. I have not  gotten a soft image when shot with the auto focus operating.  Now for those point and shoot cams that boast about \"face detection\"....5 faces...6,7, some even 15. I also have a 10 mp ultra zoom, this simply matters little if not at all, if the focussing ability of the camera is poor or average, and given the \"average lens\" quality they're made of.I have learnt clearly that a 10 MP ultra zoom simply cannot compare to a 10 MP D SLR...chalk and cheese.  I also bought the Tamron 70mm - 300mm,  F4-5.6 telephoto/ macro lens. No vignetting at either end of the lens.  Auto iso is simply magnificent, have not taken a shot where the camera over estimated or underestimated the  iso levels.The Manual mode of this camera is the most impressive for me. The rebel XS via  various magazine testing has come up faster than it's other 10 MP rivals when it comes to fps shooting, and burst images. It really does shoot 3 fps consistently, it shoots 2.3 fps in low light, worst case is over 1 fps all at 10 MP quality.I haven't used a lower quality since, given I bought a Transcend 8GB SDHC card storage is not an issue.  Most of my shooting has been at night, for the little done in daylight, it has been amazing. Colours are very bright, depth of field very very nice. Macros works well. Image optimizer simply shocked life out of me. I was in a shaded area and without flash it really improves the subject without over blowing the background, stuff that is almost impossible on point and shoot cams.  Stuff I disagree with from the \"reviews\" : 1- \"The camera feels cheaply built\"....simply wrong, nothing is shabby, buttons are actually easy to press, doesn't have cheap clicks to them, the lens mount has a secure feel to it, and a proper snap when it is set. Battery compartment is certainly secure. Your finger must intricately open the door for entry, won't be an accident issue. Rubber door at a.v. ports snap in well. Rubber grip is firm enough, smooth enough to not irritate your hands.  2- \" XS is \"overpriced\" compared to the XSi.....Xsi shoots slower than the XS, XSi picture quality is equal to the XS even though the XSi is 12 MP. The XSi may be the 3\" LCD and a few other upgrades, but these upgrades don't add up when the picture is taken and the quality of both cameras match alike. I may have chosen the XSI if I wanted to spend the extra $150. u.s but for the lesser price, I'm yet to regret.  3- \"The XS \"only has a 2.5\" LCD compared to a couple of it's rivals having 3\" LCD's\". I can see every thing clearly with this screen, even with Histograms, and grids onscreen. If LCD's get much bigger then canon may need to install a tv tuner as well....the 2.5\" is more than sufficient.  4- \"The XS doesn't have SPOT METERING compared to the XSi, so this is a big issue\"- haven't encountered a reason to complain yet, after 500 night shots and 200 day shots.THE DOWN SIDE: the EOS software for uploading the photos to computer, and remote controlling the cam via computer is AWFUL. It's a task to upload, as it is beach balling when you hit \"upload\". Digital professional software is non responsive. I have not been able to use the software past the install point. Mac version here.Better use i-photo and photoshop.I highly rate this camera, and as a videographer who's accustomed to t.v. broadcast quality the REBEL XS is worth it, and since canon is so intent on pushing the rebel XSi they have significantly lowered the price on the XS.....I recommend people buy the XS and get a good lens with the discount earned. The trick is in the lens and the user, and lesser the camera.", "Date": "November 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Affordable DSLR (Canon XS vs. Olympus E-510 or Nikon D40/60)", "Author": "J. Gallo", "ReviewID": "R2F8VSRAY6IGJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to save you the time and uncertainty in choosing the best affordable DSLR. For those considering the Canon EOS Rebel XS, the Olympus E-510 or the Nikon D40 / D40x  / D60, I believe the Canon XS is the best choice. Also, at the price difference between the XS and the SXi ($150-200 as of December '08), the XS is an excellent alternative--both take exactly the same high quality pictures, save the 2MP difference, which is negligible at the end. Please note that the XS's new lens kit comes with the better quality EFS 18-55 Image Stabilization lens (they are better engineered); and that Canon is offering nowadays generous rebates on telephoto lenses when coupled with the purchase of the XS (I bought mine with the entry-level Canon EF 75-300mm III lens with a generous instant Canon rebate. Don't buy from anybody different from B&H; Photo, directly from Amazon, Adorama, Buydig/Beach Camera; stay away from Broadway Photo and TriState).Canons are popular for the excellent image processing. Nikons for their Nikor lenses. Olympus, some say, for the color of some of the pictures they take.The Olympus E-510 has important flaws, e.g., the average performance in high ISO speeds and highlight blowing. Also, its inconsistency with good results is worth noting.The Nikon D40 lacks important features, e.g., image stabilization in their kit lens. The D60 is lacking the high picture quality ratings of the Canon XS. Both Nikons are nice looking, which is a selling factor I usually consider; but picture quality should be your top criterion for the long run.Don't go through the extensive research I have already done (months, and intense debating). The Canon XS is a winner (specially with the new IS lens kit), even more with its current price (Dec. '08: $480). It is feature rich (you can even add 3 of your preferred defined Picture Style modes), good/professional looking (black body), even the sound of the shooter is nicer than the others. Bottom line: Excellent picture quality, high ISO/low light remarkable performance, and relevant features and space for customization make the Canon XS a winner for months and even years to come.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent starter DSLR", "Author": "Brandon White", "ReviewID": "R3H84JRAWP2OCK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is geared toward complete newbies (such as myself) who are coming from the point-and-shoot world.I purchased this camera due to a budget constraint and after reading numerous reviews. For what you features you get, you simply cannot beat the price for an entry level DSLR camera. You may have looked at the XSI (as I have) and have been tempted to put forth the extra $100 or so to get that one. If you get down to the nitty gritty between the specs of the XS and XSI, you'll find that they are very minimally different, and more importantly, those \"extra\" features will have no bearing on you as a DSLR newbie.This XS (1000D) model is oft overlooked because so many are praising its \"bigger brother\" the XSI. But take a look at a side-by-side comparison and you'll notice not much has been scaled back for this XS. Save that extra money for better glass. I would even be willing to speculate that a future firmware release will address some of these scaled-back features.PROS-Currently the best bang for buck you're going to find (at this time).-Canon didn't scale back very much from the XSI-Some report that the lower MP (10 vs XSI's 12) gives better image quality because of the sensor (DigicIII).-Excellent image quality even with the supplied kit lens.-Easy to use (with some research-effort on your part)-Canon compatibility -- nuff said.CONS-Not crazy about the build materials (some sort of plastic). When I purchase things, I plan on owning them for a very long time, regardless of how \"outdated\" it may become a few years down the road.-Some button placements for me seem counter-intuitive, but remember, I'm only a newbie.-Has crop sensor like all of the rebels.-Live View usefulness is questionable.In short: If you're coming from P&S;, you will not be disappointed with this purchase. It will meet or exceed your expectations of photo quality and features.", "Date": "December 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "For the money, the Rebel XS delivers.", "Author": "Gwac", "ReviewID": "R1AH4ZBLPI95NE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**Note 2/18/2011 - After 2.5 years, the Rebel XS is soon-to-be obsolete with the announcement of the Rebel T3 in early 2011. The T3 presents significant improvements over the XS, with higher ISO settings and better high-ISO image quality, video capability, a nicer LCD, and a marginally higher frame rate. Unfortunately Canon continues to cheapen the \"feel\" of the camera with smoother plastics and no rubber grip. I think the T3 will not have the same appeal or bang-for-your-buck as the XS did in its day, given the competition. If you insist on going Canon I recommend stepping up to the T3i, which is packed with nearly all the features of the larger 60D. Otherwise check out the Nikon D3100 or Pentax K-r.**Revised 18 Apr 2009**(4.5/5 stars)This year I decided to finally get a digital SLR. The market is filled with excellent choices and early January saw a plunge in prices that has since receded, so I feel like I picked a good time to buy. The downside of having so many options, though, was trying to decide which one was right for me. Not being too familiar with dSLRs, I read lots of reviews and learned the terminology, and after a couple weeks finally decided on the Canon Rebel XS.Based on what I was willing to pay (around $650 or less), I considered three other cameras before buying this one: The Canon Rebel XSi, the Nikon D60, and the Pentax K200D. I think Nikon has excellent offerings at the \"enthusiast/semi pro\" level (D80/D90 and D300, respectively) that are arguably superior to Canon's lineup, but I was disappointed by the D60 in general, mostly due to the lack of autofocus compatibility with older lenses. The main attraction of the Pentax is the high build quality with weather sealing, but it also sports a decent quality kit lens, a large viewfinder, and internal image stabilization. What concerned me about the K200D was the image quality, especially with JPEGs, as reported in a number of pro reviews. As is the case with many entering the dSLR world, image quality was my #1 consideration. Finally, live view (the ability to compose with the rear LCD) is a tool I have found to be quite useful in certain situations and it is notably lacking on the Nikon and Pentax models that I considered.So, left with the Canons, I considered what I might get with the XSi for the nearly $200 extra. As a beginner I simply wasn't convinced that the additional features on the XSi were worth the extra cash, the image quality the two cameras being basically equal. So I sprang for the XS, got the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens with the savings, and still had some cash left in my pocket. Generally I've been quite happy with my decision. There is a lot of talk about how camera makers \"intentionally cripple\" their entry-level models, but you're unlikely to notice this if it's your first dSLR. If you pay more for the next step up, you're arguably paying a premium for new technology that you won't even notice or appreciate that much, and will either be commonplace or obsolete in just a couple years. If I had spent more I think I would have skipped the XSi and gone for the 40D, which sports a better build and a nicer kit lens, the Pentax K20D, or perhaps the Nikon D80 or D90. My plan is to stick with the XS for a few years until Canon gives me a compelling reason to upgrade.So anyway, what is my impression of the Rebel XS after 4 months of solid use? Generally, quite good, but here are my thoughts:The good:- Image Quality. Period. This is the Canon trademark. The basic JPEG modes are great when you don't want to bother with the creative stuff. The level of sharpness and the color rendition are quite good for my tastes, and can be easily adjusted. One thing I have noticed is that the default sharpening is fairly high and can easily lead to artefacts when rendering fine details. I would recommend turning down the sharpness on all the picture styles to 2 or 3 to avoid this.- Performance at High ISO. Many of my favorite photos have been taken in low light situations and I've decided there's one thing everyone looking at dSLRs should consider carefully: image quality at high ISO speeds. Using higher ISO speeds is extremely useful when trying to get sharp pictures in low light situations (without using a flash). Simply put, in the entry level market Canon outperforms the competition. I've taken a number of pictures at ISO 1600 that look great, especially with the in-camera noise reduction turned on. I made an 8 x 10 in. print of one of these photos, and the noise was almost imperceptible. (Update: I only wish I could shoot ISO 3200, which is available with some of the newer models coming out.)- Ease of Use. The camera puts all the essential controls at your fingertips. Adjusting ISO, exposure compensation, metering mode, and white balance, not to mention picture styles and autofocus mode, are all quick and intuitive operations with this camera. The only thing that takes a little more time is setting custom white balance, which I seem to do a lot under incandescent light. Also, after activating live view in the menu system, it can be turned on or off at the press of a button.- The camera is small, light, and physically attractive. With my 50mm lens attached, the camera is remarkably compact and very lightweight. Also, having dealt with the lag of compact digitals for years, the responsiveness of this camera is especially noticeable.- Kit lens. While the 18-55mm IS lens that ships with the camera leaves something to be desired in terms of build quality (and manual operation), the optical quality actually surprised me. I wish it gave a little more reach on the telephoto end, but in general it does a good job. In fact, the main reason I'm not getting the $500 EF-S 17-85mm is that the 18-55 performs better on the wide end.- Software. The image editing and organizing programs that come with the camera are not the most refined, but they are fairly powerful, and likely adequate for those who don't want to part with another $200 or more for an image editing program. Also, you can control the camera remotely from your computer with live view, which is cool, if not extremely useful. As far as I know, Canon is the most generous company in terms of what they offer in their packaged software.A few complaints:- Build/Grip: One of the big reasons I didn't get the XSi was because it offered no improvement in the way of build quality or ergonomics (besides the marginally better grip material). The downside of this camera's low weight is the plastic construction. Especially compared to a Pentax (which is also plastic but has a metal frame and usually weather sealing), there's a noticeable difference in the way it feels in your hands. There are advantages to each approach, but some will prefer a more solid (and heavy) construction. Also, some reviewers complain about the grip. I have relatively long fingers, and while I agree that it is a little cramped and awkward compared to a Pentax, for example, it's a secure grip and while taking pictures I've never found it to be uncomfortable. I should say that I spent some time comparing the D60 grip to this one, and ultimately preferred the XS. While the build and grip are adequate, they do detract somewhat from the overall photographic experience. I would give more weight to these factors if I were to buy again.-Lenses: This is somewhat of a mixed bag. Generally speaking, the deal with Canon is that if you have deep pockets you'll be hard pressed to find a more comprehensive set of high quality professional lenses. As a hobbyist, however, I shy away from spending $1000+ on a lens, so my options are more limited. There are some very good options: the EF-S 10-22mm, EF-S 60mm, EF 50mm f/1.4, EF 85mm f/1.8, and EF 100mm f/2.8 all come to mind. But other bases aren't as well covered: a made-for-digital \"standard\" prime lens for example, or a quality upgrade to the kit lens (the 17-85mm gets pretty lukewarm reviews). Ideally you should give some thought to the lenses you think you might purchase, and survey what each company offers. I tend to think that Canon, Nikon, Olympus and Pentax all have good options, but their strengths and weaknesses are different.- The viewfinder is fairly small. When dealing with a shallow depth of field in low light and I want to get the focus just right, I often switch to live view to zoom in and focus manually (This is actually very handy). The only basis I have for comparison is my ancient Minolta film SLR that sports a much bigger viewfinder. That said, when I compared the XS and XSi, I didn't really notice the difference between the two.  APS-C cameras  have smaller viewfinders that 35mm/full frame cameras in general, but they vary enough that it is worth giving it due consideration as you compare cameras.- Metering: This is a fairly minor quibble, but I find that the metering overexposes fairly frequently, especially for high contrast scenes (outdoors). I have found that I get better results dialing in -1/3 to -2/3 stops of exposure compensation in these situations.- Slow continuous shooting rate. If you're shooting action (sports, moving animals, etc.) in RAW you'll want to look elsewhere. The JPEG rate (3 fps) is comparable to competitors and has the advantage of being able to shoot until the card is full. In RAW, however, you'll find that the 1.5 fps (for 5 frames) is pretty slow. I don't generally shoot action so this was not an important consideration for me. (Update: After 4 months of pretty heavy shooting, I still have not found a need for a higher frame rate.)Overall: Considering the price of the Rebel XS and the overall quality of the package (image quality and feature set), I'm convinced it gives you the most bang for your buck of cameras below $500. This camera is capable of taking very nice photographs, and I find the control layout to be very intuitive. The only things that leave me feeling somewhat unsatisfied are (1) the relatively \"cheap\" or plastic feel of the camera (2) the grip, which is satisfactory but does not fit the shape of my hand like other cameras, and (3) the lens lineup. I recommend spending some time holding the camera (and others) and researching lenses to make sure the XS will meet your needs. Having said that, the image quality of this camera is excellent, and I am most satisfied by its low-light performance. Furthermore, if you think you'll upgrade in the next several years, I have a feeling Canon will be forced to compete aggressively with Nikon in the enthusiast range, so you can be confident you'll have some good options down the road. (Update: I have to say that the XS is a camera that has grown on me. Despite my quibbles, in everyday use there is very little to dislike about this camera and it will take something very significant for me to switch brands.)Other options to consider:Olympus The Olympus Evolt E420 10MP Digital SLR Camera with 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens provides an interesting and very cost-effective choice, particularly for those who value small size. To take full advantage of the minute camera, you'll want to consider getting the tiny 25mm pancake lens in addition to the standard zoom. The E-420 delivers on features too, with live view and a good dust control system. The downsides? First, there is no in-body image stabilization, unlike its bigger brother, the E-520 (also a good option). Also, lens selection is limited due to the unique sensor size. That said, the lenses are designed specifically for \"four thirds\" sensors as opposed to \"full frame\", and thus have more appropriate focal lengths. More importantly, several of the Olympus Zuiko lenses get rave reviews for their optical quality. A final downside is that the \"four thirds\" image quality, in particular dynamic range and high ISO, isn't quite on par with Canon or Nikon. However, I suspect that for many people it will be more than good enough.The recently announced Olympus Evolt E620 12.3MP Live MOS Digital SLR Camera with Image Stabilization and 2.7 inch Swivel LCD w/ 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens crams most of the features of the semi-pro E-30  into a body closer to the size of a E-420. If you have a bigger budget, check this one out, it looks like an excellent camera.PentaxFor those who want a more upscale dSLR experience in the entry-level market segment, I would recommend the Pentax K200D 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens. You get a quality build, weatherproofing, a nice viewfinder, and arguably the best built kit lens there is (complete with a nice lens hood!). Make sure you can live with the image quality if you plan on shooting JPEG and keep in mind there's no live view, but if you read owner reviews you'll find very few unhappy customers.For a bit more you can bag yourself the Pentax K20D 14.6MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction and 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AL II Lens. This camera could be categorized more as \"semi-pro\" or \"enthusiast\", and is best for those eager to take greater manual control of their camera. The new sensor resolves the image quality issues of the K200D and has greater resolution. It has live view, but the implementation is apparently pretty crude. All in all, it sounds like this is a very good deal at current pricing and again, you'll find very few unhappy users.NikonThe Nikon D90 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lens is an update to the D80 that by all accounts equals or exceeds its Canon rivals on image quality and delivers a very nice feature set including HD video. For this, though, you'll need to pay a pretty penny (around $1100). And at that price, you'll want to give full consideration to the well-built Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens, or its more expensive sibling, the Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens.The recently announced Nikon D5000 12.3 MP DX Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens and 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD falls into the same price range as the D80, and is something of a blend between the D60 and the D90 in terms of the design. Most of the features, however, have been passed down from the D90. It's billed more as an upper entry-level camera (like the Canon T1i and the Olympus E-620), and as such lacks a few of the more serious features of the d90 like the top LCD, the nice large pentaprism viewfinder, and wireless flash control, but most of the bells and whistles are there. Like the d60 there is no autofocus with non AF-S lenses, though this is becoming less of an issue since the release of the AF-S 35mm f/1.8 and the AF-S 50mm f/1.4. At the price it's being offered at the moment I would still very much prefer the D90, but this is a decent option nonetheless.The Nikon D3000 10MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens was also announced recently and appears to be a refresh of the D60 built around the same sensor with an upgraded autofocus system and a few new bells and whistles. No video or live view, though, due to the older CCD-type sensor. Again, my personal feeling is that if you buy Nikon the D90 is currently the best deal for \"enthusiasts\" who plan to get into the nuts and bolts of photography. If you only plan to shoot very casually and can still find a D40, that camera also represents a great value.", "Date": "January 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "XS 10.1 is okay.

My dissatisfaction revolves around the XS' focusing challenges. The camera itself is great - image quality is good, the sensor works fine -- the uptick in image quality between the smaller sensor on a point n shoot is (to me) very noticeable -- but the XS, with its 7-point focusing system has problems, especially in low light.I understand the XSi's 9-point system is more accurate, and face it, most of us shoot in less-than-ideal lighting conditions, and we don't want to shell out $300 for good flash that won't turn our subjects into wan, demon-eyed ghosts (I'd rather spend the money on a good prime lense) so a good-auto focus system is a must. My wife has a Panasonic FZ28 with a Leica lense, and its autofocus capabilities are far superior. XS - great camera, but the autofocus issues are very disappointing.

That S30 took better pictures (as far as quality) than my wife's Minolta 6 MP DSLR that I bought her years later. I must have bought at least 10 point and shoots and DSLRs for my family and work.  All different brands.  But every time I didn't buy a Canon I was upset with the purchase.  There have been some good Nikons but none better than the Canons. My biggest disapointment was the Minolta DSLR I bought for my wife.  Against my better judgement the guy at the camera store talked me into it.There are more qualified sites and people on the internet that will give you great professional reviews of the camera and all it's features. Here is a few reasons I chose this one:I was contemplating  between the XS, XSi or TSi. I did a lot of research online before making my decision and in the end the price won out and I settled for a less megapixels and less $$$ (10.1 is plenty for what I needed).  Like all Canon DSLRs this camera takes great photos and the kit lens that it comes with is a great lens for a DSLR in this price range.  The body is on the small side and people with large hands may find it uncomfortable if they are taking pictures constently. But the small size also has the benefit of better portability.Besides the picture quality, my favorite feature is that it comes with the software to control the camera and most of it's features right from your computer. I actually use this feature a lot, because I do product pictures and indoor still life with it.  I can set all aspects of the shot, aperature, sharpness, shooting mode, white balance, etc, then control the shutter right from the computer.  The picture loads right to my computer, I can examine the shot adjust the raw photo or make any adjustments necessary and retake the photo without relying on the small LCD screen on the camera.  The liveshot helps even more because I can view the shot live as I am setting up before I take the picture. Other copmpanies charge more $$$ for this benefit. I like to use Raw format and make adjustments then convert it to a user friendly format.  If your not familiar with the Raw format, it is worth your time to do some research and learn about it, your pictures will be much better.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not a bad starter DSLR", "Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "REK4KUH39B3K5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned a Nikon D40 and used it heavily for six months last year.

This feature is not on the XS and I really miss it since I tend to shoot in manual mode a lot. 3) The biggest reason is the proximity sensor for the LCD. This is huge! I use the Rebels to shoot at night when I don't want to bring the big bodies. When shooting at night, the display on the LCD stays on with the XS; on the XSi as your face gets close to the viewfinder, it shuts off, then turns on again after you move away from it.  Shooting at night with the bright LCD is a big distraction.There are other differences such as the higher resolution and other stuff that really didnt factor in.  If you're deciding on XS vs XSi, get the XSi.  Now if you're going from P&S; to SLR and need the very basics, then the XS will fit your needs perfectly.

How I love my S5, but I outgrew it too.Of course, the Rebel XS is just  the entry level for Canon's SLR cameras, but the difference between it and the advanced P/S cameras is very noticeable.  Image quality is much  smoother and sharper, especially using a shallow DOF.  You can use the maximum ISO setting with little noise or image degradation.  The body itself is petite and fits my small little meat hooks (hands) perfectly.  No shutter lag.  The difference is night and day for those considering the switch.  You will be glad you did.  I'm sure I will outgrow my baby Rebel too, but I will only have to replace the body.The cons?  The wide neckstrap is chafing.  That's minor, of course.  The kit lens has maximum aperture of 3.5, and seems soft.  Everyone knows that, though.  I have ordered a Sigma 17-70 2.8, which was reccommended as a far better everyday lens by an experienced photographer friend.  Another con is lens envy:  I knew the good glass is expensive, but I wasn't prepared to pay thousands of dollars for those big zooms I covet.  Solution?  Another photographer suggested I get a decent portrait lens, and rent a zoom.  I only want it for a few days per year.Bottom line,  The XS is entry level for amatuers interested in advancing in photography.

I see this as nothing more than a selling point aimed at point and shoot users. You cannot use the live view in full auto setting, you have to be in one of the manual settings. You cannot use the shutter button for auto focus (read the review on dpreviews.com), I don't want to go into a long explaination here. The view finder is very easy to see and use for taking pics so I probably wont be using live view except maybe to compose a tripod shot,take it out of live view and take the shot.The 18-55mm IS kit lens is really a very good lens and I have no complaints about it (well maybe the plastic mount).

Also, with the minimum investment, if I could master the basics on the basic DSLR, I could upgrade in the future.~20,000 shots later I am more than satisfied with the use of the XS.

It is a TRULY amazing camera, especially for its low price. It takes AMAZING pictures, even after all this time. I'm also still finding features out (Which is my fault for not reading the manual when I got it) such as the ability to make the built-in flash brighter or dimmer. The camera is incredibly easy to use out of the box. If you're new to DSLRs, you can just switch it to Auto mode and snap away. There is also different scenery modes, Program Mode, Shutter Priority Mode, Aperture Priority Mode, and full Manual (Which is what I use 90% of the time.) The camera feels very solid, and has easily withstood the bumps and bangs that a 17 year old put on it.

I was impressed with them then, and they continue to impress me now.  A year or so after leaving the studio, I was in the market to buy my first d-SLR camera.  I compared several different brands and models, and I finally settled on the Rebel XS.  I hate to use a clich\u00e9, but it really is \"more bang for your buck\".  The Rebel XS just has so much more to offer than its similarly-priced Nikon counterpart (the 3000D).  Most of the time, you can get this camera bundled with a Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS SLR Lens, which is a really good starter lens.If you're looking to go pro, then you'll probably want to buy a more upscale d-SLR (the Canon EOS 400D is a typical model), but if you just want a well-rounded, entry-level d-SLR, the Rebel XS (any camera from the Rebel series, really) is the one you want.  This camera gives you the freedom of a d-SLR with the ease of use of a compact (\"point-and-shoot\").  The camera is highly customizable, and most accessories you buy for this camera will be compatible with other Canon SLR models, as well - in case you ever want to move to a more upscale model in the future.  The nice thing is, however, that you don't HAVE to buy accessories.  If you have a camera, a lens, and a memory card, then you're good to go.  One thing you will need with this camera, as I mentioned, is a memory card.  It uses a standard SD Card, but I would recommend a high-speed card (for fast shooting) such as this one: SanDisk Ultra II SDHC 4GB SD Memory Card (SDSDRH-004G-A11, US Retail Package).Getting started with this camera is very easy; the user's manual is very clear, and the camera itself is not complicated.  The camera has a variety of shooting modes which serve everyone from the newbie amateur to the seasoned pro.  One nice thing about this camera is its ability to shoot RAW images, which means you can edit your pictures more without sacrificing image quality (an unfortunate drawback of JPG format).  If you're used to JPG, however, this camera still saves images in that format.Compared to many d-SLRs, this camera is lightweight and versatile.  It has a built-in flash, but a more powerful flash can still be attached and synched if necessary.  If you're using it for portrait photography, it has the ability to shoot tethered (meaning it is connected to a computer/software and its images go directly into the computer instead of to the SD card).  It has a lightning-fast startup; just flip the power switch and it's turned on.  The battery lasts a long time before needing to be recharged.  One of the only drawbacks I've noticed to this camera is that it won't run on AC power without a special adapter (which must be purchased separately), but since the battery lasts a long time (and since additional battery packs for this model are relatively inexpensive), that isn't a large problem (I was taking 200-300 pictures per day and went about three weeks before needing to charge the battery).  A huge advantage that I should mention is that the camera's sensor is self-cleaning.  This means that there is no complicated process of removing the sensor and cleaning it (although manually cleaning it every so often is a good idea).I could go on and on with praise for this camera, but no one wants to read a book-length product review.  I'm not going to say that this is the \"last camera you'll ever need,\" but it is an excellent model for both snapshots and for shutterbug experimenting.

You can take your time to learn how to use the manual settings. So far I have not used the complete manual setting, but I do like to use the Time Priority or the Aperture Priority setting. You set one and it automatically adjusts the other. It will also estimate how over exposed or underexposed the picture you are about to take is with the setting you chose. It takes pictures quickly so you won't miss your shot and you can also set it to take pictures continuously.

I purchased my XS a little under a year ago for six hundred dollars, and in the ten months I've owned it, it has proven its value time and time again. It is well-built, sturdy and compact but not excessively heavy, featuring simple controls, most of which can be adjusted while looking through the viewfinder. The image quality is great, though the kit lens is somewhat disappointing - for an extra bang to your photo I recommend the Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens.  Often the XS is overlooked in favor of the XSi, but in my opinion the concessions you make for the step down (no spot metering, loss of two AF points, a slightly smaller viewscreen, two fewer megapixels, and the lack of a cool lowercase i) are well worth the drop in price.

After weeks of research and asking around online, I've been directed too this camera, which I heard was the same as the new updated XSI, only difference was  few features and a smaller screen. I've owned this camera for around a year and a half, no problems, and still takes pictures as good as day 1. The camera is really easy to use, and really user friendly. It is extremely easy to use, and has preset modes that you can automatically take decent photos with if you aren't yet good enough changing the aperture or ISO. The lens included is a basic 18mm-55mm, which is pretty good and offers image stabilization and auto focus, which both come in handy if you are a beginner or intermediate and can't quite get your pictures to come out clear. As you learn the tricks and features behind this camera and can soon work your way out of using the preset modes, into using the more advanced modes, you may want to upgrade the default lens, as it isn't the best for more advanced pictures, but I'll explain in more detail on the actual amazon page for the lens. You will be satisfied with how good the pictures and lens this camera comes with, and some pictures I've taken actually look like they are textbook/magazine worthy, and that's just with using the default settings. There are a lot of custom shooting modes you can put this camera in if you want more vivid colored pictures, or just black and white. You can change a lot of things, as well as use certain shooting modes that work better for moving things, as well as better for capturing objects with more depth. You might want to get the book Canon XS for dummies, which will go into more detail than the manual about all the specific features, what they do, and break this camera up piece by piece until you know what everything is and when the best time to use each piece is. I can't really explain what is best since it depends on what you're shooting and if you are a beginner, you may want to stick with the default modes, as they take really good casual pictures and you don't have to mess around with the settings. How do you know which default to use? Well I think its obvious, theres standard, obviously standard settings, close up, if you are taking a close up picture of a flower or object, night shot, obviously used under low light settings, and no flash, obviously if the lighting is too high to use flash. That brings us to flash, the built in flash is great for close up shots where lighting is average to low, but is pretty weak when you get farther back then 10 feet and becomes quite useless unless you are taking a night shot. I suggest removing flash if you are taking a medium distant shot in adequate lighting. Otherwise, you may want to but a portable flash that you can attach if you're looking for a wider range, and more efficient flash. This camera overall, is really good and can be used with most modern lenses. Canon makes some really great lenses, and even look at the ratings, this camera might not be the best for an expert, but for a beginner/intermediate who wants to get the most for a low price, this camera delivers much more quality than what you pay for. Don't let the price fool you either, it is really good and will satisfy you in terms of features and quality, and with the right lenses, is capable of taking magazine worthy photos.

It's true to try the actual camera and see where you're most comfortable with helps, I went to Best Buy to do this.So why Canon XS, 3 key things that made me decide to get this one:First and foremost, the price. It's almost the same as the Nikon D40 (other sites offer cheaper kits for d40 but you don't get the VR lens) but more funtions, cheaper than the Nikon D60 and more functions. As compared to pentax and sony, this is definitely cheaper and more lens options.Second consideration is the fact that there is an adapter available in the market that can be attached to this camera so that it will be able to use nikon lenses. Try searching for Haoda.Third and last is the actual shooting tests. I tried this, nikon d40/d60, and sony a300 at best buy. Used auto settings for all cam and my shots came out best with the Canon XS.What's the drawback? Sensors were removed in the XS model. Same sensors that is used for the remote shutter or for a flash to work away from the camera. No worries though, there are 3rd pary remotes that can work with the XS so you'll have remote shutter capabilities. As for the flash, you can always mount a flash that can work as the master flash (disabling the light) and have another flash as the slave flash so you have the same effect of having a flash work that is not connected on top of the camera.I'm really happy with my choice, no regrets. Whenever I pick it up, it makes me want to shoot anything just to see how great the pictures it'll produce.Be careful though, once you decide to buy this, spending starts for the accessories (memory, bag, cleaner, lens, etc).As my friend would put it, 'don't think about it anymore, just buy it!' =)", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best entry level DSLR", "Author": "David Chan", "ReviewID": "R13NO1EZOJ0NIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am looking for a camera with the following attributes:1) Great indoor photo image quality.2) Great ability to focus moving kids3) Fast captureI tried several compact/prosumer cameras and none of them fulfill the need.

Rebel XS and XSi are made in Japan.So, I have used the camera to do the following which I can't do with a point-n-shoot before.1) Indoor singing performance.  With Full auto mode, the pictures are clear and sharp.  The only issue is a lot of red eyes to fix even I turn on the red eye reduction lamp.2) Indoor portrait.  The picture with no flash is super!  The direct flash is too strong.  I may need an external flash to help adjusting flash angle to make flash picture better.3) Outdoor picture.  Most of the point-n-shoot cammeras can do very good picture already.  But with Rebel XS, the focus time and snap time are crazily fast.

This takes a speedy hand and eye, especially when your subject is always moving, and sometimes this just does not work out very well.  This might not be an issue just shooting with the kit lens, but with the 50mm lens on high aperture, your subject can very easily be thrown out of focus.- FPS are only 1.5 on RAW mode.  This sounds adequate, but, again, when your subject is moving, it's really not.- Low-light focusing relies on a \"pre-flash\" which does not work well with Professor Kobre's Lightscoop (which I always use for indoor flash situations).- This camera is LOUD.  Compared to my Nikon, the shutter click is somewhat obnoxious, though this is something you just get used to.- There tends to be noise in a lot of my shots, even in outdoor photos (in the shade), despite me turning down the ISO and adjusting the shutter speed and aperture accordingly.This camera was mostly fine before my daughter became so mobile.  But now I've outgrown it and am looking to upgrade to something faster and with better options.  I have shot many stunning portraits using this camera + the 50 mm lens, though, and have been mostly happy with the results.  If you just want a DSLR you're going to shoot on auto mode with, then this isn't too shabby.  If you are looking to have a camera with complete control over your images and will spend a lot of time shooting moving subjects, you might find yourself wishing your camera was capable of more.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Beginner Camera", "Author": "Nadya", "ReviewID": "RF9VLJABFBYMN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just started getting into photography and wanted to get a good DSLR but i could not afford to spend over $500.

Flash with bounce/diffuser - the one with the cameras is pretty harsh if you are trying to take portraits.3.

Clark \"Yo, Teach!\"", "ReviewID": "R11W6WTKXDBRM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is an excellent choice for those who are taking their first steps into serious (SLR) photography. The \"basic\" zones give comfortable starting point for new photographers; selecting one of these puts the camera in full automatic mode, akin to a point-and-shoot camera.The XS also has plenty of room for a new photographer to grow with 4 pseudo-manual modes, and full manual. Each of these modes, particularly manual, allows for much greater artistic expression and control than the automatic modes.Another nice feature of the XS is the extremely low noise when using higher ISO values. I tend to keep my camera in ISO100, but when I've needed to venture to ISO800 or ISO1600, I've found very little need to post-process for noise. The XS works surprisingly well in low-light settings.By virtue of being a Canon camera, it comes with E-TTL 2, which gives superb control of a hotshoe speedlight. The XS, like other Canon cameras, also has excellent lens support. When I was camera shopping, I brought along some old 35mm lenses just to see if they would work - one Nikon (from 1977) and one Canon (from 1979). The Nikon (which happened to be a D90) refused to work with my 28-200mm Vivitar lens. The XS, however, worked fine; it accepted the fact that I was willing to work with a fully manual lens. That compatibility can be very useful if you have some old lenses around, assuming you're willing to manually set aperture and focus.The XS is very, very light. I'm not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. SLR cameras are inherently bulkier and heavier than point-and-shoot; the super-light plastic shell on the XS leads me to believe that the case will most likely crack before the mirror gets knocked out of alignment. I do not recommend traveling with this camera without a good camera bag - this should be one of the first accessories you buy (along with a UV filter).I do all of my photography in RAW, and use Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop CS4 for my post-processing, so I can't comment on the Canon software bundle.Do not let these reviews sway you between cameras; rather use them as a starting point for going to the store to get a feel for the camera. Hold the camera, see how it feels in your hand, how it performs, etc and then decide what fits your needs best. I've found, at least in the case of the XS, that you can get it for 10%-15% less than at a retail store.This camera has done nothing but impress me since I purchased it two months, and several thousand shots ago.

I have never had a problem with a Cannon camera, and I have found that their design is to give YOU the control that you need, not what they assume you are going to use it for.This camera is intended for professional use, that is why it costs so much. You have control over pretty much anything and everything. It has an interchangeable lens. So you can use telephoto or macro (or even fish eye.) It has control over your autofocus nodes so that your target can be crisp and clear instead of your standard AF troubles.The SLR means that anything you see through the viewfinder is exactly what is going to be imaged. So, no more of those point-and-shoot head chopping issues.This is not a point and shoot. It lacks a lot of the useless junk... like the crummy video mode (what is the point of that anyway?) and the other pre-installed features that assume you know nothing about photography or just don't care.With ISO mode used properly, you will never have another muddy dark picture (unless you are shooting in perfect darkness) or have those blasted-out \"living on the surface of the sun\" shots.At 10 megapixels, the quality is great. It is high enough that you could produce a poster size before it starts losing integrity. (Higher mega-pixel cameras may come along, but this camera will age well. I estimate that you will get a good 10 years out of this before it is obsolete.) I got this one because I did not want to pay for a bunch of features that I am never going to use. It is the lowest on Cannon's line of professional cameras, but it is a pretty darn good price. You can get an additional 2 Megapixels for $200 more. But if you are on a tight budget, definitely consider this camera.Note: Make sure you buy a UV filter. This isn't really for the UV protection but because it is a cheap way of protecting your lens from scratches.

Since then, I've been using point-n-shoots, which were fine for what I used them for. Recently, however, I felt that I should be more serious about photography, so I took the plunge and got the Rebel XS. I've owned the camera for a little more than a week, and I gotta say, this thing is way better than any point-n-shoot I've ever used. I can't seem to put it down, as I take pictures of about everything. I have put it through its paces, both by taking a ton of low-light photos, as well as daylight photos. The picture quality is superb. I haven't had any real issues with grainy photos, save for subjects that would NOT hold still for anything. The lens that comes with the camera is really great, though that IS coming from a newbie. One thing I truly will appreciate in the future is the fact that it's compatible with most all of Canon's EF-S lenses, of which I plan on acquiring the 55-250mm in the near future. All the buttons are really self-explanatory, PLAY reviews, TRASH erases and so-on. The camera really feels like it could take a beating (though I really don't want to put it through a \"field test\"). It's much more hefty than a PNS, which should really come to no surprise. To really get the most of this camera, I might suggest using the full manual settings. I'm not a professional by any means, but I really feel that if you're batting around the idea of upgrading to a DSLR, this is the perfect choice. It's one of the cheaper options, completely compatible with higher-end lenses, great image quality, what have you. This might not have the highest resolution image processor (10.1 mega pixels), but believe me, resolution isn't the same as image quality. Get this, I promise you won't regret it.

For a professional grade camera it is very user friendly, even though it has the basic capabilties similar to far more advanced, and expensive cameras.  The XS is a feature rich SLR which gives the user access to more advanced tools and options to use as they become more familiar with how they work (aperture, white balance, depth fields, ISO settings, etc.).  In the interim, you can always just set it to auto and let the device do all the thinking for you.  The photos I have taken using auto are far superior to anything I've taken with point and shoots.It uses a 10.1mp processor which is plenty to produce sharp, vivid, photos.  It is lightweight but doesn't feel cheap, it feels quite solid.  Has an ergonomic hand grip, built in flash, easy to use dial to adjust for macros and various pre-set conditions profiles (portrait, landscape, action, night, etc). It also has a live view function on it's large 2.5 \" display, something few cameras in this range have and a valuable asset in this camera. What's more it's fast, very fast.  On continuous shoot it snaps away 3 frames a second which is perfect for sports, dancing, nature photos,and any other time you can't miss the shot. I've used it for fast action shots and they all came out sharp and crisp.  Although it doesn't have the capacities or megapixels of a more advanced professional camera it still has plenty of power and versatility to fine tune your shots and create outstanding photos. Comes with an 18-55mm lens which is quite nice for general photo taking in virtually all conditions.  Of course more powerful specialty lenses can be interchanged easily.  Also uses a remarkably long life rechargeable battery capable of lasting up to 600 shots or 400-500 with flash.I think it's an ideal \"first SLR\" for someone who wants to take their skills to the next level; not so basic it lacks the ability to produce high quality photos but not so sophisticated one would need a doctorate in photography to understand how to use it.  The designers of this camera struck a nice balance between the two. For a guy like me who is by no means a professional photographer the Rebel XS is a great camera to learn on.

The owners manual is very easy to understand and very helpfull when you want to get away from the full auto mode, which i used only the first day because playing around with just a few setting like the saturation, the exposure, and white balance produced outstanding photos...At night, with a tripod, the shots are absolutely outstanding, as you see cities at night in magazines. Yes you need a tripod not because the camrea is cheaply built and it shakes, but because we are humans and we shake... maybe if u buy a more expensive LENSE, not a camera, you might get less shaky hand held results, however most of the time, in the late afternoon, sinsets and so on, you can be fine without a tripod.. you only will need a tripod if you want to take night shots of cities and lights, where its impossible to hand hold the camera...Other than that, at night, the camera is great, and the flash works very well. A new canon flash however will be the first accesory i will buy, since when you use flash, you get 0blur when taking photos of your kids while theyre running inside in dim lighting condition, and an external flash would keep the colors great also, however as i said, the built in flash is fine..when capturing photos of people at night with flash, there is 0 shake in the photo...there are very few things that i can complain about, keeping in mind that i did not purchase a 1000$+ camera. The small things that you can complain about will only be gone with the high end slr cameras, with like 50 point focusing and 11 frames per second...however after having this camera for around a month now, ive taken magnificent photos...the more i use it, the more i learn how to play around with the aperture, the shutter speen and all the other setting, and i will continue to imporove in taking photos..", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the money, but lots to learn", "Author": "LittlePowers \"Powers\"", "ReviewID": "R1W3650HUTLWXC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a great camera, with a lot of features to learn.

The additional megapixels that you get with the xsi is not worth the cost in my opinion.  The 2.5\" screen is definitely small by today's standards, but I like the live view function (as far as I know it is the only camera at this cost that has the Live View function).It seems that both the Nikons and the Canons low end SLRs are coming with the IS or VR lenses now.  this is a nice feature, but it adds to the cost of additional lenses.  Having the Stabilization technology in the body of the camera is something to consider if you will be purchasing multiple lenses.  The mission for my camera only requires 2 lenses at most though.As far as picture quality and performance go; we ran some basic tests against my wife's D60.  It was very different to see the difference in the ISO tests we did.  We used people in dark lit situations (more realistic than the scientific pics of cards you see on the research sites). They both are capable of about 3 frames per second which is fine for what we need, but a lot of cameras are capable of more today. The Canon beats it with the AF points and the overall feel and layout of the camera.  Once you learn hoe to use the camera, both are capable of beautiful shots.I like having it in my bag for travel.  It is lower cost so I'm not totally worried about it and it is sophisticated enough to handle any type of landscape or street shot that I come across without disappointing me.

Upgrading about every 3 years to higher megapixels and greater zoom range.  I got spoiled by live view standard with all point and shoots, so I resisted SLR until that feature became available.  My last camera was a professional series Kodak P850 which had every feature of an SLR plus live view (manual focus over ride, 12X optical Ziess lense, and more).  My renewed interest started when Olympus launched live view on their SLR.  Thought that was the way I would go until I compared the Canon side by side.  The live view feature on the Canon is not as good or versatile as the Olympus but the other features to me, were better especially feel and handling.  Canon offered SD media which was the standard of all my previous cameras and other electronics (the Olympus had CF).  My next delima was whether to go with the XS or step up to the XSi with larger LCD and 12 megapixel quality.  I went with the XS on price and am extremely pleased.  The ease of use and quality of photos are superb.  I shoot mostly at 5 megapixels to conserve file size and they are excellent.  File size is about 2 mg.  Live view turned out to be no big deal.  Once I got an SLR back in my hands after these many years, I found I enjoyed the view finder and even manual focus the way I go on most shots.  Auto focus and live view are still there and good when you hand off the camera to someone else to click your family photos.  The kit lense of 18 - 55 is very nice particularly for indoors but I am anxious to add a 55 - 250 as most of my shots are outdoors.  The lense at 28 tends to bend the photo but does help in confined spaces.  Very easy to use right out of the box.  Full instruction book not a CD is very helpful.

Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (Black) was my first dSLR, and I fell in love.  The Rebel XS is my replacement for the Rebel XTi, and the only reason the XTi is being replaced is because it was stolen.The differences between Nikon and Canon, are in my opinion minimal as far as quality goes.  The larger difference is in personal comfort between the two, assuming no oddities.  (NOTE - I used a Nikon D3000 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens and found that the images were not as sharp as what I had experienced with my Canon).Part of my enjoyment of the \"low-end\" Canon dSLRs is the cost.  Simply put, it gives me more money to spend on lenses, filters, and the other items which last.Pros:1) Cost.  The Rebel XS is about as inexpensive as a dSLR can get and still be up-to-date.2) Ergonomics.  I find the Rebel XS fits comfortably in my hands, that the buttons are easily found,(and to me at least) logically located.3) Weight.  When carrying my kit up the mountains, ounces start to add up, and the Rebel XS is a very light camera.4) Images.  Image quality (except as noted in Cons), is superb, and the resolution more than adequate for 8x10 prints even with considerable cropping.Cons:1) Low-light performance.  Compared to the XTi, I find that the Rebel XS has more digital noise at higher resolutions.  I wish that it had a max-ISO limiter, like is found on the Nikons.2) Not weather sealed.  Unlike the top of the line Canons, the XS is not weather sealed.Overall, for anyone who is getting into dSLRs, or needs a backup dSLR, I would recommend the Rebel XS.  It enjoys most of the features of the higher priced prosumer dSLRs with none of the cost.  The included kit lens is a nice addition, with included IS.  The XS might not be the most expensive, or the flashiest camera, but it will leave you with enough money in your pocket for another lens, such as the Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, or a flash Canon Speedlite 580EX II Flash for Canon EOS Digital SLR Cameras and keep you within $1000.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "to the point...", "Author": "B.

It's a tedious detail, and all SLR cameras have it to some degree, but the external flash mount sticks out a bit and as you slide camera into a camera case/bag it has a tendency to hang up - maybe one of you readers could invent a little plastic cap that slides on there so it is smooth ?

If you are feeling adventurous and want to get into the creative side of the dial those aren't all that hard to get a hang of either. Still this isn't the best part.The best part in my opinion is the spectacular image quality that comes out of an entry level DSLR. Even when you have to turn the ISO up the image doesn't have much noise.Sure it only has a 2.5 inch screen, a 7 point AF system and doesn't shoot that fast in raw but at least in my opinion those downsides are negligible.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "A.

The extra features on the XSi are overkill for the average photographer, I think, and this camera takes lovely photos and is easy to use.

We are beginners as far as photography is concerned, and there is plenty to keep us busy learning with this camera. The menu is pretty user-friendly - I was playing around with settings and able to understand what I was doing within the first little bit. The battery is great - charges quickly and lasts a long time. The camera feels well-built but is not too heavy. It's a great size, easy to carry around. Probably my most favorite things about it are how quickly it turns on and is ready to shoot pictures, and how fast it is in between pictures - I can take pictures over and over as fast as I want. Also, picture quality is awesome. For example, I took a picture of my husband and son at the base of a waterfall we had hiked up to. When we reviewed the pictures and zoomed in on the waterfall, we discovered that the camera had captured detail on hikers way up the side of the waterfall that you can't even see in the picture at full size. Overall, we're very very happy with this camera, and if we had to do it all over again, this would be the one we picked. It arrived very quickly with everything well packaged.

You really can not beat this price. In terms of camera itself, it is really good entry digital SLR camera. Here's pro and con from novice users perspective:Pro:-Overall pictures quality. Better than most entry level digital SLR from other manufacturer.-Very low noise.-extremely light weight and compact size.-Good battery performance. You do not need an extra one.-Pretty good kit len.-Liveview although it is definitely not as good as many people has mentioned. It lags about half a second.Cons:-2.5\" LCD is ok but 3\" is much better. I got spoil by 3\" screen on SD880 which is an excellent wide angle camera.-IS on lens unlike Sony alpha. You almost always need tripod if you put 75-300 lens with no IS on.-ISO 1600 is definitely not as good as Nikon.-Vertical picture does not rotate back and forth when you move camera accordingly. It does rotate (from vertical to horizontal) but not the other way around when you move the camera vertically.Conclusion:If you plan to upgrade SLR camera 5-7 years from now, this should be your first Canon digital SLR camera. If you plan to use SLR for more than 7 years, I would suggest XSi. There will be a better and cheaper digital SLR camera. 7 years from now I'd expect HD video and full frame sensor from entry level camera.XSi VS XSThe different in features between both camera worth about $100.

Smith", "ReviewID": "RKQOTJSGT185T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Edit 2: I have now had this camera for about 11 months now. I have taken over 8000 photos with this camera, and I'm still going strong! I took my son's 1 year old photos and his Christmas photos for 2012, and again, I had several relatives asking who did the photos because they looked professional. I purchased an economical vinyl photography backdrop and have been using that to take my photos. I still use the two kit lens mentioned below and have recently added a Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens to my arsenal. I am hungry for a more professional grade camera so I can flex my photography muscles, BUT, this camera still takes great photos and I still love using it.Starting out by saying, I highly recommend this camera as a beginner photography camera. I'm basing this review on experience with SLR cameras. I have taken over 1500 pictures with my camera since I have gotten it about a week ago.Okay, I've seen on a couple of reviews for this camera that people are outraged for reasons that have nothing to do with the camera's quality. Going to address those here:**No memory card with this camera: Most of the time when you purchase a digital camera, unless you purchase a special bundle, they will not come with memory cards. There are too many different capacity and speed memory cards, and most cameras that come with a stock memory card come with very poor quality and small capacity cards. If it did come with a card, it would probably be a 2gb card, and people would probably be outraged that it didn't come with a larger memory card. Do your research on memory cards and get yourself a decent sized and decent quality card for your use.**Lens isn't as high quality as they want and upgrading costs lots of money: Well...YEAH. Camera lenses can cost thousands of dollars. If you want to use this camera for something beyond amateur/beginner use, you're going to need to upgrade your lens, because this camera comes with a stock lens. Yes, you're going to get fairly decent pics from this camera without upgrading, but if you need to take wide angle shots, landscape shots, or high detailed close-ups, you have to get a different lens because this lens is not made for the reasons listed. The point of getting this type of camera isn't just high quality, it is the fact that you can change the lens and use the camera for a variety of photography uses. All of that to say, it's a stock lens for basic use.**Camera isn't easy to figure out how to use: Well..YEAH. This is a DSLR camera. You're looking for a Point and Shoot camera, which means that all you have to do is point and shoot to get the camera to work. This camera has more features/functions than a normal Point and Shoot camera, and to get the most out of this camera you need to research about SLR cameras and/or take a class on photography. Yes, there are \"easy\" modes on this camera, but if you want to get the most out of this camera and want to take pictures that don't look like a point and shoot, you need to learn how to use the camera**Camera doesn't take \"fast pictures\": this camera has the ability to change shutter speed, which means you can take action shots with this camera, if you have the settings correct. Using the LCD screen instead of the manual view finder means the camera will have extra processing time while taking continuous shots, not to mention your SD card may also delay how quickly you can take pics because of save time to the card itself. As I stated above, do your research on SD cards and get a decent quality SD card. I'm using a Class 10 card on my camera and have had no issues with continuous shots.I am going to admit that I actually have a refurb version of this camera, and it does not have the kit lens with it. I currently own and am experienced with the following cameras: Canon EOS Rebel 2000 35mm Film SLR Camera Kit with 28-80mm Lens, Canon EOS Rebel K2 35mm SLR Camera w/ EF 28-80 II Lens Kit, and Nikon Coolpix L100 10 MP Digital Camera with 15x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom. And yes, I realize the K2 is the upgraded version of the 2000.I love my film cameras. Love them to pieces. I took my son's newborn pics with my K2 and the 28-90mm lens. After basic tweaking of the levels in GIMP, they looked like professional pictures (I was asked by several people \"who did them for me\"). No complaints about the quality in Canon's film SLR line, but as many people know it is getting more difficult and more expensive to take your film to be developed. With a young child, I don't want to keep the chemicals to do it myself in my house, so finding a place to do it for me is becoming more difficult, and understandably so. Most people getting film developed these days are people who have had a roll of film sitting around their house for 3+ years and expect it to still be viable. BTDT as a film technician at a 1 hour photo place.I love my point and shoot as well. The problem is that I want to have a hobby camera to play around with and take some professional quality photographs of my son that I can send out to the grandparents, godparents, and hang in my house. PaS cameras have a different ratio on the size of the photograph, and I often find that when I take my photos somewhere to be printed the color balance is way off (even if I have photoshopped it to print properly), and that it is grainy (despite my 10 MP L100 Nikon).The best quality prints that I've had have been from my 35mm Canons. I wanted something affordable, and I found it in the Canon Rebel XS. My husband insisted that I continue to use my film cameras, but with the cost of the special batteries the cameras take, the cost of film, the difficulty in finding fast film developing services locally, not to mention the cost to develop film, I have no regrets about purchasing this camera. I can take as many pics as I want, and it doesn't cost me anything extra if I mess up a shot :)Pros:- Easy to use (if you take the time to learn how!!!)- backwards compatibility with my EF lenses- small/lightweight (For a DSLR in any case)- rechargeable battery with charging baseCons:- no dual SD/CF slots or USB mass storage capability.- compact body, not so comfy for bigger hands (my husband specifically in my case)- LCD is 2.5\", smaller than my Nikon, but I suppose that also accounts for the smaller body size of the cameraWhile I'd prefer to have a CF slot to use, it is convenient to have an SD slot for use because my Nikon also takes an SD card. It's nice to be able to use the same card on different cameras. I can transfer the images, format the card, and then use it wherever I need it.I mentioned that I took over 1500 pictures. Much of this is due to the fact that I'm using an non Image Stabilization lens with my camera, and I have a VERY mobile 6 month old baby. I don't want to burn out my camera's flash taking pics of him, and so due to poor lighting in my house, I have the ISO jacked up, the aperture wide open, and the lens speed slower than I'd like to get enough light in the pictures. I don't regret it though. It's been a lot of fun experimenting in manual mode and not having to worry about wasting money developing shots that came out poorly.If you are a beginner and you are interested in photography, get this camera, get to know it, and take beautiful pictures.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great SLR for a Beginner", "Author": "J.

I have to say it is a great camera for people who just wants good pictures and be interested in exploring the photography world. For people who are enthusiast, this camera falls short. The screen is only a 2.5in which is bare minimum in today's standards. At 10.1 Megapixels, it doesn't really matter unless you're making huge posters or big framework. The shooting speed on the camera is also slow at 3fps in JPEG and 1.5 in RAW. The focusing on this camera is good during the day time or in places with a lot of light, but takes awhile in low light situations. All these issues have been said before, so I'll leave it at that. On the upside, if you're just taking pictures and viewing them on a computer majority of the time. The image quality is an improvement from Point-And-Shoot Cameras. Hook this camera up with a better lens or a 50mm 1.8II, The picture quality will look as good as any upper Canon Rebels. Remember, it is all about the person using the camera, not the equipment. It's like using a pen, anyone can use a nice inky pen, but it is the person who uses the pen to write novels and articles.

First, it comes with good kit lens (18-55 mm with Image Stabilizer). The kit lens is said to be one of the best in the entry level SLR's. Secondly, it has 10.1 megapixel CMOS sensor and DIGIC III processor and it shares an interface with almost every current Canon DSLR all the way up to the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III. The pictures come out highly detailed, noise-free and sharp. The camera is light weight (but doesn't feel cheap or fragile) and memory slot holds SD/SDHC card which are much lighter, cheaper and faster than the old CF card which some other SLR's require. It has a decent battery life (400-500 shots per charge).From 12 modes on the dial, 7 modes are called Basic modes which have auto settings. Depending on the mode you select from it the camera will select the best settings for you, so that you just point and shoot. The other 5 modes are for creative photography where you can tweak different camera settings (metering, white balance, shutter speed, flash etc.) to suit the image. In these 5 modes you can also use the live-view, so that you click pictures looking at the LCD-screen (with 5X or 10X zoom).Another fact you should seriously consider if you're a beginner to the SLR photography: Canon Rebel XS has a 7-point AF system, compared to 3-point AF in Nikon D40/D60. A point focus system gives you the option to select a specific area in the whole frame to focus, it's especially useful when you're taking a Macro pictures and want to create a sharp image of the area/object you select by AF and a good blur (Bokeh) on the surrounding parts of the frame. Even though a 7-point AF in Rebel XS is lesser than a 9-point AF in SONY A200K, it still comes out better than SONY when you count other features in the Rebel XS. There is so much more scope for being creative using this camera.Many people have made a huge hue-n-cry that the Rebel XS does not having a spot metering. But in my use I still haven't found the desperate need of it. The Rebel XS has \"partial metering' which reads approx. 10% of the viewfinder at center and you can recompose the image to your liking by adjusting the aperture setting and shutter speed in Manual mode, if necessary.If you are considering photography as a serious hobby then I suggest you to consider this camera. Once you get this camera you should start saving money to buy good Macro, Ultra-wide and Telephoto zoom lens then  you will see what wonders this camera can do. In addition, Canon has a large collection of SLR lens that you can choose to fit this camera. So, for a price range between $450-470 this camera is a steal!But if you're still in doubt, then please read the complete review at: [...] and also go to the nearest Best Buy or local camera store to compare the performance of Canon Rebel XS with Nikon D40/D60, Olympus E-420, Pentax K200D and SONY A200K.One accessory I would recommend is the Canon XS/XSI Digital Rebel Kit with Case, 58mm UV Filter and LP-E5 Li-ion Battery", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great camera for the price.

You can, of course, control exposure, shutter, and aperture, but you can also control white balance and color modes with a push of a button.At high ISO speeds you can shoot indoors without a flash, your pictures will turn out beautiful and perfect every time.  What once you would need a 80a or a neutral density filter for you can now do with a few brief menu options on the camera.Another great feature is the live view feature where you can use the LCD screen to see what the camera sees.

It's been able to take pictures in lower light settings without a tripod than I'm used to with film SLRs; the only drawback I haven't figured out yet is that it seems to lighten the scene (spread the available light?) over the entire picture at times more than I would like for some shots.

Shooting RAW gives you a lot of flexibility if you are processing in Lightroom or Photoshop, especially with the poor light balance performance (incandescent light is yellow).

A few things that are slightly disappointing are that the ISO only goes up to 1600 and my point-and-shoot type camera goes up to 3200, and it does not shoot video of any kind (the new rebel shoots 1080p video, it's about twice the price of this one).

My wife was a film photography enthusiast while in Art school and she really enjoyed getting her hands back into the field with this very entry level DSLR camera. Initially, we were really impressed with the camera. It feels solid, the controls felt good, the image quality was fantastic, though the kit lens leaves a lot to be desired. As we got more experience taking photos and learning the controls and effects of different settings, we became disenchanted with the review screen on the back of the camera. There's nothing wrong with the screen for most uses, but there were multiple shots that looked well focused on the review screen (due to it 230k pixel resolution and 2.5\" size) but were in fact slightly out of focus. We decided to make a switch to the Rebel T1i that has a review screen of 3\" with almost 4x the resolution. We found no issues in using a 10 MP camera as this image size is more than sufficient for most Prosumers or Amateurs. My wife was also frustrated (though I don't think there's a remedy for this) that the viewfinder only shows 95% of the actual image. She has a fantastic eye for framing shots and gets it looking just right in the viewfinder only to find that when it's downloaded to the computer, there's a little something extra in the shot that wasn't visible in the viewfinder. As I checked the full lineup of Canon cameras, this seems to be the nature of the DSLR world. While we did understand that the LiveView screen shows exactly what the sensor gets, my wife is old school viewfinder and the AF doesn't work as nicely in LiveView.I would recommend that if you want any sort of zoom functionality beyond maybe 2x, that you purchase the camera body only and invest the difference in a good quality zoom lens.For regular 50 mm type shots, we found the Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 II lens to be a great price with a great aperture range. My wife despises the look imposed on a photo by a flash, so a lens with 1.8 aperture allowed her to take indoor shots of family events in really crummy light that turned out great.I would strongly recommend this product for beginning photography students and for anyone that wants more than a point and shoot, but doesn't want to spring the extra $200-$1000 for the next few entries in the canon line of budget dslr.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS CAMERA", "Author": "Heather L.

I researched like mad and did EVERYTHING suggested (people suggest some crazy things, but I tried it all) to no avail. I have a hard time blaming a certain brand or model for problems like this, but I must say it was a BIG deal. I am a professional photographer, so to have a camera that has these problems is just unacceptable, and I had to work a LOT harder than ever to save up for my new T3. Which I love.When I went to Walmart on a late-night emergency run (my Error 99 was to the point where I couldn't take photos anymore, and I had a wedding to shoot the next day! For once, thank goodness for Walmart and their crazy hours!)I had every intention of buying another XS to replace mine. Apparently between the time I called and the time I got to the store, it had been pulled off their shelves due to a recall.I searched EVERYWHERE for info on this, and couldn't find a THING.I doubt the woman was lying to me, but I highly recommend you guys do some research into this model and potential risks. I loved loved loved my XS before the errors took over, but I'd have spent more on a better model had I known :(My problems involved Error 99 (where it won't save the photo I just took, and won't do anything else until I remove and re-insert the battery. Also I couldn't turn it on without doing this to the battery first EVERY time I turned it on, otherwise it would give me the error within the first 5 frames).Also, my LCD screen stopped showing in color. Not quite black and white, but mostly. There would randomly be streaks of neon color (not color that belonged in the photo. Just a big pink or green streak across some part of the photo). I couldn't see full color in any photo until it was on my computer, and even then it took about 5-10 seconds to load and become colored. Weirdest thing I've ever seen. And when I went into LiveView, it looked like a crazy heat-sensor camera. You know, neon colors and crazy psychedelic shapes....it was madness.Eventually, my view finder slipped out of place somehow. I could hear something rattling around inside, but the actual viewfinder looked normal until you looked THROUGH it. It looked the way it does when you put on someone else's glasses. Someone who has TERRIBLE vision. No joke, the view finder was useless, live view was useless, I was basically shooting with my instinct. And it worked for about a year! Not that I had a choice of giving upon it, even with all the problems. Doing this for a living meant making it work somehow. And I'm happy it's OVER!So...be careful!

I also bought a Professor Kobre's Lightscoop Standard Version Bounce Flash Device - Universal Model for this camera for use indoors. A week ago I bought the book Digital Photography All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies and finally started to read it tonight on Christmas day. I remember I had a video output cable for my DSLR, but with the book's help tonight, and knowing that I had a small t.v. screen, I decided to take photos with the t.v. turned on. This was the result, and it amps up the fun factor because it reminds me of when we eagerly waited for our photos to pop up at the professional photographer's studio!Just plug the cable into the camera and t.v. with their respective ports, put the t.v. in the AUX mode that will recognize the t.v. port, turn the camera on, and just have fun!", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT DSLR for Beginners", "Author": "Mrs. Henshaw", "ReviewID": "R1D347DIFWX83U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this DSLR in 2009 as my first \"good camera\" after learning how to use it in high school digital photography classes.

I'm on a relatively tight budget, so I wanted to stick with a simple body, knowing I'd upgrade the lenses first.  On those terms, the Rebel XS fit the bill perfectly, and I'm quite happy with my choice.  The features are certainly sufficient for someone learning the technical ins-and-outs of photography:  exposure, focusing, depth-of-field, etc.  After a few months, the only feature I REALLY miss is spot-metering.  Other things would be nice (better performance at high ISO speeds, more MPs for cropping, more fps and RAW capacity in burst mode, wireless remote compatibility), but I don't think I need them to learn substantially more about photography.As for the lens... I shot with the kit lens exclusively for the first couple months, but I quickly found the low-light performance too limiting.  I've since added two prime lenses to my collection:  the \"Nifty Fifty\" 50mm 1.8 (great lens for less than a hundred bucks!), and a 28mm 1.8.  Still, the kit lens is nice when I'm walking around during the day and want the flexibility of a zoom.  It's not as sharp as my primes, and the picture quality isn't as good in general, but it's a decent lens overall until I can upgrade to one of those fancy zooms with a red stripe.  If I had to do it over, I'd probably still get the body + kit lens package.No, the Rebel XS is not a professional-grade DSLR.

From what I can remember, looking at the grain and detail from my film prints with an Agfa loupe compared to digital images from the Rebel is simply incredible! The detail captured by the Rebel XS is almost frighteningly scary when greatly magnified, especially people's faces.Having used Canon point and shoot A series digital cameras, including the A95 which I felt took spectacular images, the Rebel XS brings photography to a completely higher level. Being on a budget I would never have purchased this SLR except I found it on clearance at W-mart for $350.00 new with the 18-55mm IS kit lens.As a novice I believe DSLRs are so refined today, especially among Nikon and Canon, that only minute differences in image quality can only be revealed through professional analysis. I think for the beginner seeking a DSLR the greatest factor would be price and the need for HD movie mode.PROS:+ Say goodbye to 35mm film touching on the reel, hazardous chemicals, darkrooms, and the need for an enlarger.+ So simple to use that even a child can take photos like a pro.+ Stunning photos out of the box on auto mode, although many manual controls at your disposal just like the old Nikon F and Canon F1's.+ Skin tones, color balance, sharpness, detail, and low light images with higher ISO settings are simply incredible.+ Long battery life+ Fast shooting response.+ Great construction and feel.+ Very sharp Image Stabilized kit lens.+ From searching professional reviews and comparative photo images I believe Canon does have a slight edge with their balance of color, sharpness, and noise suppression over the competition.CONS:- As with all modern electronics the next generation always has something you wish for at the same or lower price.- With the XS being an older model I probably would not have paid more than $350 for it and stepped up to a Nikon D3100 or T series Canon- No HD movie mode.- No spot metering.- Continuous shooting mode could be a little faster, although it has an unlimited buffer that will allow the XS to shoot  without stopping until the SD card is filled.* I actually saw another Rebel XS on clearance at W-mart for $260.00 but found out it had been returned twice, so the deals are certainly out there for this model as of this date.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS Rebel 1000D", "Author": "Lawrence L.

Eg: if i want to take pictures of animals in a distance i should probably buy the camera and a lens that gives me more focus control or a color filter.

However, compared to some of the competition, it's not all bad.  Take as an example the Nikon D60.  Both are 10mp, but the Canon is a CMOS sensor, that should produce a tad better photos in poor lighting conditions.  You also get a 7-point AF system vs. 3-point.Compared to the Sony Alpha 300, it's hard pay $100 premium, considering the Alpha has in camera stabalization, supports wireless flashes (with built-in flash) and has a 2.7\" tiltable live-view.  But the Canon kit lens is better optically, and the build quality appears to be slightly better on the XS.

The 55mm lens can focus an a minimum distance of .25 meters (about 10 inches), which for me isn't really close enough to do macro shots.

I had tried (and returned) several newer point-and-shoot cameras, but was disappointed with back-to-back comparisons to the older camera.  They did not compare well at all, and I assumed that a newer entry level DSLR should run circles around a 5-year old model.  That was not the case.In its favor, the Canon XS did extremely well in low-light conditions and for close-up photograpy.  However, for wide angle landscape photography, which is about 90% of what I use a camera for, it performed poorly.  The sharpness was lacking when compared back-to-back to the A630.  In daylight conditions, in at least 50% of the pictures, the A630 looked sharper and clearer compared to the XS, with the remaining about equal visual quality.  When using a PC and magnifying the resulting pictures on specific features, the A630 had better or equal resolution on the details.To be fair, I did spend about 3-4 hours adjusting the XS setting using User Defined settings(sharpness, contrast, etc.), and after lots of trial-and-error I was eventually able to consistently get pictures of equal quality to the A630 - in the A630's Auto mode.  I do not think that is acceptable for a DSLR, entry level or not.  I even borrowed several Canon lenses from a friend with a DSLR, and while the pictures were slightly better-or-equal with \"prime\" lenses, the difference was not worth the price.  Other zoom lenses gave the same results as the Kit 18-55mm lens.  In fact, I also used their XSi, and while the pictures were marginally better, that for sure was not worth the extr $300 (at the time of this writing).I have returned the camera to Amazon and will instead wait for the more expensive DSLRs to come down to a reasonable price.  Hopefully, the sensor/camera/software combination for one of those models will be more applicable to landscape photography.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Justin L.

The only reason you should want to get this camera is the price tag. I have owned mine for about a year now and It did what a starter camera should: It taught me how to shoot with a DSLR. Now that I have that down, I see the flaws of owning this camera.  The camera is light, just over 700 grams, and it has no fancy 'leatherette' on the grip. It sounds like a luxury, but the plastic on the grip is cheap feeling. By no means is it actually cheap, but you do spend 500$ or so on the camera.... The plastic body is top notch construction and I don't see it breaking anytime soon, with normal wear.The Frames Per Second speed is slow so that may be an issue on what you shoot. All settings are kept at a general scale. other, more expensive DSLR's, offer more accurate settings, like 640 ISO, unlike the 400 ISO-800 ISO on the XS. The 10MP sensor is fine for low light situations and Noise performance is great. If you plan on cropping a lot of your photos, you're going to lose quality, and quick. With this camera, I learned to shoot the photo great the first time, so that I would not have to crop.  One experience I had with this camera was an Error 99 during a SHOOTING SESSION. While i was mad that I couldn't take any more photos, I understood that, as an electronic, It had the potential to fail, like all electronics. I sent it into Canon and had the camera back within a week and a half. I wouldn't disregard Canon cameras for this error because Canon has good customer service.  If you think of going pro or want nothing but the best for your photos, you'd sell this baby quick. it doesn't take video which, for me, doesn't matter, but with many DSLR's shooting video now, it seems outdated. The 10 MP sensor is poor for cropping and the slow FPS make this a 'cheap-pro' camera. But it's not a bad camera. It just might not be the choice for someone that would like to REALLY get into photography.

ERROR 99 and ERROR 05 messages occurred during initial usage of the camera which signify the inability to shoot/capture/save images consistently if at all and the obstruction of the flash auto pop-up system respectfully. This realization and experience is highly disappointing to me after investing in a product from a seller in which I researched, trusted in and was satisfied with the initial customer service. At this point, I'm testing the camera essentially to see determine the extent and expense necessary to endure for a working product, both of which are rather high. I wish for the seller comply with my request to return this product for a full refund of $299.99 as I have conducted myself in a professional manner after being provided with a extremely disabled and basically useless camera from a seller who claimed it to be \"Used-Like new\" and described it as \"Excellent working condition\". In closing I wan't to emphasize that after minimal to no contact or usage of the camera since it was provided in a damaged state, there is no way in which I am responsible for this unfortunate dilemma and after considerable research on these camera issues I am assured that this product was not damaged during the process of transportation. Again, I ask that the seller respond to and approve my return request and insist that a commitment to solve this issue is reached.

But it's just a lousy value if Canon can't be bothered to issue new drivers for new operating systems.  The new XS was unimpressive.  The interface is still klugy.  I'll set it up to take a perfect picture, and then a software delay hits and I get the closed-eye laughing shot instead of the perfect shot I \"clicked\" on.  It is still slow for taking live-action shots.  Expensive lenses lock you into the Canon brand, so future driver support is a big deal.  No video option, and 10.1 MP is unimpressive 4 years after they released a 10 MP camera that they have intentionally turned into a brick.  If you are into photography and might buy the expensive lenses (as I did), you become locked in compatible bodies and Canon's history of discontinuing drivers could impact you.  I prefer the pocket kodak for snapshots, because the LCD preview is a lot easier to use than the tiny viewfinder on the Canon.I had invested a couple more thousands into Canon lenses and other accessories, thinking I would always buy Canons.  I thought it was a good investment - I had bought a \"great\" camera, and the lenses would fit a new Canon next time I wanted to upgrade.  I always used to own Canon cameras, and I thought I always would.  My $1000 2006 digital Rebel is useless now because Canon refuses to issue drivers for it anymore, and the old drivers are incompatible with Windows Vista or 7.  Yes, there are workarounds, but I liked being able to take pictures through a direct computer connection and being able to download shots quickly and simply.  When I upgraded my operating system, I discovered that Canon did not support new operating systems for my 3 year old camera.  Basically, my 3-year-old Canon stopped working, because, without drivers, half the functionality was dead.  So I went looking for a new camera.  I got the new Rebel XS.With the Rebel XS, I was basically paying $500 for updated drivers on 4-year-old technology.  When a friend asked why I bought an expensive new camera just a few years after buying a very expensive new camera, I explained the driver issue.  My friend showed me his Nikon, and it was a quick sell - great camera, good track-record of driver support, lots of lenses and accessories available.  I returned the Canon.  If physical functionality died the way driver-driven functionality dies when Canon discontinues support for relatively new cameras, Canon would have a reliability record right in the gutter.  But the net effect is the same - many of the functions I used died in 3 years.  So I've decided to start over with Nikon.  I'll take a hit on the lenses now, but I won't be forced to replace the camera every few years when Canon discontinues drivers for the old cameras.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "BEWARE!!!
