{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Camera is useless because of horrible battery life", "Author": "Ardivus", "ReviewID": "R24QTRMQ294L71", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is garbage.I put brand-new and fully charged NiMH batteries into the camera, and can only take 1-2 photos before getting a low battery warning and having it shut down.Recharged the batteries and had the same results.Tried new energizer alkaline batteries and got 40 photos and two 10 second videos before the battery warning and shut down.The camera does not have a flash on it, and the lcd screen on the back is tiny.  There is no reason that the batteries should die so quickly.Picture quality is about what you'd expect for a cheap 3MP camera.  I think they look about as good as my old 1.2MP camera phone used to take.  This isn't good by any means, but I would overlook photo quality on a camera like this if you could use it more than 15 minutes.When I got it, the camera cost $25.  I know you get what you pay for, but since 3MP is so outdated now, I assumed that the low cost was mainly because it is old technology, and thought that it would be a durable camera for my younger son to use.I would return it in hopes that this one is defective, but geeks.com makes you pay shipping for returns and I will be out more than it is worth on the off chance that it is just a defect in this model and not that this camera is just garbage.Giving this a one star rating is generous.  Would have done zero stars if I could.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Happy great snorkeling", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R3RL9PP137Y24Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very nervous about this purchase since most of the reviews aren't great but I thought it was better than a throw away camera that I could only use once. We did  snorkel with this and it works great! We didn't have any problems with image being blurry. My 4 and 6 year old have taken great underwater pics with it. I think the other reviews are by camera people who use high tech equipment. For the price, this is a great purchase. It is very simple to open the area where the micro card and batteries go and we have opened it numerous times to download pics; it is still dry. I just don't understand the negative reviews. I am very happy with this purchase. By the way, the pics out of the water look just fine too.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Trekker Dig Camera", "Author": "alonleon", "ReviewID": "R2VNW8NQOORBPH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think its a good product for the price, the camera works fine, its very simple, light, and easy to use, but obviously the camera functions are basic as well as the resolution, like i said before its a good product for the money I paid, it does its work well", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value.", "Author": "Josh Kesecker", "ReviewID": "R1RCWVICTDOCAE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Works good, not great quality, but you get what you pay for.
