I wanted to break-in to the whole digital thing and thought I'd start out with a faily cheap camera such as this one. I figured the cost was only equal to x-many disposables anyway. I knew beforehand that this only had 2MB internal memory and that the resultion wouldn't compare to my professional equipment. However, I wanted to give it a try and needed a little lightweight something (less than 5oz, compared with my 3lb Mamiya 645).I must admit I was very disappointed. The software which came with this camera was pretty good (for a freebie) but the camera itself is a little quirky. Obviously you can't review what you've got in memory unless you do the download; but I could live with that. However, one truly frustrating thing was the clearing of memory. I found this almost impossible: and if you can't clear the memory, it's full-up and you can't take any more shots. I ended-up having to take the batteries out and leaving it well alone for a week.Thereafter I re-loaded the thing and tried again. This time it seemed ok and managed to delete everything I wanted. The pictures were just ok (as I suspected, but you get what you pay for, right?). Then one day it just stopped working. I hadn't used it for a week or so and when I did it just stopped; and no, it wasn't the batteries.So beware guyz. Perhaps I was unlucky. These things are becoming cheaper and cheaper by the day; I would hold-out and get a real digital camera, not a digital instamatic like this thing here.", "Date": "December 2, 2000"}, {"Title": "Good performance for the price", "Author": "Hummer \"cheesehead\"", "ReviewID": "RE0T4J16KX8FW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned the Largan LMini 250 for almost a year now and am happy with it's performance.  For the price, you can't find another camera with the same resolution and a flash.  I've had absolutely no problems with it.  The serial cable is a pain if you're used to USB but it gets the job done.  It would be nice if it used standard batteries, but the one included is easily found.  The camera is small and light weight and I always carry it with me in a jacket or shirt pocket.  A guy in my bowling league had a \"300\" and he was absolutely delighted to have a picture taken that night.  The picture quality leaves a little to be desired, but you'll find nothing better for the price.  It can be easily tweaked with software for a very acceptable result.", "Date": "December 20, 2000"}, {"Title": "Unfortunate Experience", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R299431PMF3HS1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the Lagon Lmini 350 as a Christmas Gift.

Some good and some bad.  Some of these people giving the bad reviews must be a little deluded.  Maybe they thought someone was going to give them a [price] camera for [price].  Wake up!  This camera works better than any camera even close to the price.  Admittedly, the included software isn't all that great, but I didn't buy it for the software.

It's consistency is kind of weird though, I have taken nice shots of lightcolored images, but haven't mastered a formula to do it consistently.  with dark objects, it seems to excel at for some reason, I am going to need to research why it  is doing that and possibly create a shutter filter for it as well...It has a led display on the back for adjusting the settings, and beeps when it is ready to take another photo, just give it a little more time to catch up since your  pictures will come out dark if you take a shot right after the beep.The manual says that you can take a shot from 2' on, it is more like 3.7 feet to 8.6 feet, I am still testing it's limitations.  External lighting does effect it significantly as  well, you can't have a room too bright, but not too dim, yet another thing I am testing.The viewer \"set up like any traditional camera\" needs a bit of calibrating, I am moving the center of the image depending upon which angle I take the shot from, it  was designed to be taken at a 100% level/horozontal/verticle angle.Over all, I am giving it a 3 because it...did a 640 by 480 res pic as well as had the flash, but that is the only reason, I'd recommend getting one if  you aren't going to be taking a ton of photo's and don't mind dealing with some shortcomings, maybe take a few shots of the same thing, doing a little trial and error  to get something decent and get on with your life without mortgaging your house over a digital camera.I don't bother with most software packages when I buy hardware, I usually download the latest drivers from the manufacturers web site and call it good, I have all  of the high end external software that they don't just give you with hardware so don't have a review on that end, but didn't have any problems getting the drivers  operational with my win 98....

It doesn't get colors right at all.  Plus, the time to process a picture is way too long.  Don't use the included software for the camera - go to the Largan web site and download the twain driver.

It gave me no problems when I started using it, and downloading didn't take so much of my time. Resolution is really not that bad. Flash just seemed to strong giving too bright reflections. One thing I don't like about it is there is no LCD where you can check if you did get the right pic.

I tried a couple other brands that made horrible pictures before.  I got good pictures without distortion from this one.  I used software I already had (Paintshop Pro) with it and never even installed the included software, so I can't rate that.  Mine came with a battery, a carrying case, serial cable, and power adaptor included.  I think the flash can be too bright, but there is an option to turn it off.I would recommend this if you would like a point-and-shoot digital camera that you can pull out of the box, load up the TWAIN drivers, and continue to use your same software without buying anything extra.", "Date": "December 11, 2000"}, {"Title": "Good camera, bad software and instruction manual", "Author": "MAUREEN", "ReviewID": "R2LDAX7OX0J32F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera was given to me as a gift, as i had benn wanting to go digital. The first thing that the instruction booklet should tell you is that to turn on the power you must open the front cover as far as it will go (while opening it it reaches a stopping point and you think that its open all the way but you need to push it a little further to turn it on. The camera itself is ok for the price and it takes pretty good pics however the instruction booklet is horrible ! it gave very little info on downloading and copying.

Software support is unreachable.  The little documentation provided is poor.Every time I turn on the camera it behaves differently, so it is impossible to reliably take a picture and get it on the computer.  Sometimes the buttons work, other times they do nothing.  If your are lucky enough to get it to download it is then difficult to get the picture in a useable format like JPG or bitmap.

Below that, this camera is a good deal. It is a simple, fixed focus basic camera. The flash tends to blow things out when used too close but at a distance over 15' to 20' it works fine. This thing is great for basic snaps you may want to send via E-Mail. The bundled software is very bad, but that is not what I paid for. The cable hook ups are a bit cumbersome, but work when you figure out that one cable has a little flat spot so they both fit.

End of problem.As to unpredictability of the flash: The camera doesn't need much light to decide for itself the flash isn't needed. We tend to set the camera to force a flash and use the \"hat\" as described above. Outdoor pictures are generally very good, but certainly not up to mega-pixel quality.The camera IS a bit of a battery-hog, but since it comes with an AC adapter, we often use the adapter for those indoor closeups. Battery savings hint: The camera uses battery #123, a single 3-volt cell. Buy a battery #223, which has TWO 123's in it, and use them, IF you're willing to crack open the plastic case, which isn't the easiest thing to do, but saves you about 30-40% over the cost of 2 #123's.", "Date": "December 11, 2001"}, {"Title": "Short lifespan", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RQXI00FCG2DC4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I used this camera for about 30 photos over a 5 month period.
