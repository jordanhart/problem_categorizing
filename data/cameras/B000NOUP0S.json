Not always wanting to use my main equipment, I purchased this camera for a general purpose like family events, travel/vacation etc.I originally wanted at least a 10x-12x optical zoom, 6-8MP, video (movie mode)with 640x480 30fps with zoom while movie shooting, AA batteries, IS (Image Stablization), at least a 2\" LCD screen, fairly compact (but not a necessarily a pocket camera), and simple operation. I compared to Canon S3 IS, Kodak Z 7812 IS, Panasonic DMC FZ8K and seveal others which had true IS capabilites.The FUJI S700 was less expensive because it is not a true IS camera or lens, but uses a fast shutter speed and higher ISO to achieve its IS mode. Otherwise it met the all other specifications I was looking for in a camera.My daughter took this camera for a two week trip to China and got very good results.  She used the IS mode often and the resulting pictures were generaly good with very little \"digital sensor noise\" because of the higher ISO setting.  She also had very good results in low-light situations where flash was not permitted, and her movie clips where good (maybe not quite as good as a dedicated camcorder but fine for general purpose).  The S700 movie mode sound uses a single microphone in the camera body for monophonic sound, where some other models have stereo if this is important to you.She shot over 1000 images and about 30 video clips on a single 4GB SD card (the S700 is SDHC compatible) and she only used two sets (4 each) of alkaline AA batteries during her trip.  The S700 will run longer on rechargable NiMH (2500-2800mAH) batteries or Lithium AA batteries.While lacking true IS, the FUJI S700 is also about $50-$100 less expensive than the above comparable cameras.  The KODAK and PANASONIC have movie modes but you cannot change the zoom lens setting while in this mode.  Being a long time CANON user and a big fan of my EOS 5D SLR and other EOS SLRs, I found the CANON S3 IS difficult to switch modes between shooting mode and playback.  It does have zoom while in movie mode however and the newer S5 IS may correct this problem. The S3 IS does produce excellent images even with its 6MP sensor (that uses their excellent DIGIC II processor).The FUJI S700 produces good to very good images in its 7MP Fine mode using ISO of 100-400. The digital noise begins to slightly appear at ISO 400, but is not unacceptable. It is easy to use and in the AUTO mode, that most people would use, the camera would produce good results.  It does allow shutter or aperture prioirty modes plus a full manual mode, but these are for advanced users in special situations and are not as easy to set as on a prosummer/professional level camera.I would strongly recommend this as a good gerenal purpose camera that has a good, fairly fast optics and very good image quality.  It is not a \"pocket camera\" with their small 3-4X optical zoom lens, but the S700 is lightweight to carry and easy to hold and use even with one-hand shooting.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Impressed With Quality and Price", "Author": "Linda D.

It's very impressive.The camera is light-weight and has a comfortable grip. The images are bright and sharp.  Zoomed images to 10X are also sharp in Auto Mode (without having to switch to the Picture Stabilization Mode on the camera's dial).  The flash works fine and pops up automatically (my Canon S3 IS doesn't do this and was more than twice the price).  Also love the clarity of both the 230,000-pixel LCD screen and EVF.Another reason I purchased this camera was the fact that it uses SD cards (which my Canons use) as well as XD cards (good for those who have owned Fuji... or Olympus before).This camera is definately worth the price even without the free 2GB SD card (ends June 11) when purchased from Amazon!*See sample photos under \"Customer Images\", top of page.Added Note:  I tested the shot-to-shot shutter lag of both my Fujifilm Finepix S700 and Canon Powershot S3 IS on shooting-digital's online test page with same results for both cameras - Without pre-focus, .4 of a second...

I had a cheaper, point and shoot digital camera before, but it's overall picture quality was grainy, and it was practically useless in indoor lighting situations. This camera takes bright, vibrant pictures indoors, and the 10x optical zoom is amazing. I took a zoomed in shot of my father from across the room, and the picture was as clear as if I had been standing next to him, even when the picture was printed at a size blown up to fill a letter-sized page.And for me in particular having being disabled, I greatly appreciate how light this camera is. With a little practice, I'll be able to handle this camera very well, which means that I finally have a camera that combines the power of an SLR and the ease of use of a point-and-shoot. And if you also purchase the Joby GP1-00EN Gorillapod Flexible Tripod like I did, this camera becomes even more accessible to those who have special physical needs. I'm so excited by this camera that I may even become an amateur photographer now.I cannot recommend the Fujifilm Finepix S700 any more highly.

It was time to retire my 30 year old Canon SLR.  I took a few snapshots before leaving home to familiarize myself with it.  Basic operation is little more than setting the camera to \"Auto\", pointing, adjusting the zoom to the right size, and clicking.  Pictures are typically bright, clear, and finely detailed, as appropriate for the 7MP digital chip inside.On the road I was getting roughly 250 images for each set of 4 AA batteries (We forgot to pack our charger for the rechargable batteries we bought).  The flash was bright and well illuminated group photos at a twilight family reunion that was turning to full darkness by the time we broke up.  Switching to the landscape mode provided excellent landscape shots.  We had a lot time under bright hazy clouds and full overcast, switching to the aperture mode let you focus on the building or feature you wanted to photograph so it wouldn't be too dark when the photo was snapped.  However, sometimes this led to an over-exposed appearance for the images.  The 10x Zoom was really useful for wildlife shots (Grizzly, elk, buffalo, antelope, deer, coyote, prairie dogs, etc.)The software packages allows you to enter some brief comments on the picture subsject as well as recording the date and time that the pictures are taken.Where could the improvements come:  This is a complex camera with the various settings.  A few days isn't enough time to really learn how to use it, especially under a variety of weather conditions and types of composition. I don't know that you can really blame Fuji for this, but users should understand there is a learning curve here. If you use the viewfinder (which I use a lot for outdoor shots in bright sun) your nose smudges the LCD.  After taking a shot, you have to hit the \"OK\" button to advance the camera, but the \"OK\" button is in the center of a variety of other controls so unless you hit the buttom exactly dead on, then you may trigger other functions like flash, brightness, etc.  I was spending a lot of time resetting controls as a consequence.  The software was a little balky at creating a duplicate image for cropping.  I ended up doing that work in the MS Picture Manager package that is on my Windows.Overall, this is a fine camera with a lot of versatility, but you'll need awhile to learn how to use all the capabilities and a fine touch on the controls since things are bunched close to one another on the button next to the LCD", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "The s700 lacks true image stabilazition, and does not match previous Fuji models on low light photos", "Author": "Another Movie FAN \"Steve B.\"", "ReviewID": "R1011295903XJD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After downloading the full PDF manual (which you can find on the U.S. fuji site) and then auditioning this camera in person for about 2 hours while taking over a hundred test shots, I finally decided to pass on purchasing the Fuji s700, and went with a Kodak z612 instead.The two cameras offer very similar features at about the same price, but the Kodak z612 has a wider 12:1 zoom range (with really great optical performance) and it has TRUE image stabilization (which the Fuji s700 lacks despite their marketing claims).If most of your shots are taken in full daylight out doors, or with a flash indoors, then the Fuji s700 can provide fine pictures, but in lower light situations, it suffers due to it's use of a tiny 1/2.5 inch CCD.When it comes to the low light performance of the CCD image sensor used in these cameras, SIZE MATTERS, and unfortunately the CCD used in the s700 is much smaller than some earlier Fuji models.To be fair the Kodak z612/z712 and Canon S3 IS offerings also use these tiny 1/2.5 inch CCD's, but those cameras help offset this by offering true mechanical image stabilization to help out in low light situations.You may recall that Fuji was the company that unsuccessfully tried to push the megapixel race into ridiculous fantasy land of marketing hype with `interpolated' resolution on some earlier cameras (fortunately the s700 rates an HONEST 7 megapixels), and now they are back at it with their claim that this camera has `image stabilization'.What the S700 DOES have is roughly the equivalent of the `sports' or `action' modes you find on virtually ALL other cameras which simply try to kick up the ISO rating and use the fastest possible shutter speed to freeze action and prevent motion blur.Unfortunately this also increases noise in the image, because it is basically the electronic equivalent of using faster (but much grainer) 400 to 1600 ASA film in a 35mm camera to shoot at the faster shutter speeds needed to stop action.Sure a noisy but sharp `hi-iso' picture is better than a totally smeared picture due to camera shake, but mechanical stabilizers (like the Kodak z612, z712 or Canon Powershot S3 IS have) can cancel out the camera shake and let you shoot at a lower ISO equivalent setting WITHOUT adding noise, so it's important to understand that Fuji's claimed `image stabilazation' mode is NOT equivalent to mechanical image stabilizers you find on some other camerasFuji had some claim to this function being a reasonable substitute for a mechanical stabilizer on some earlier models like the S6000FD (and even smaller point and shoot's like the F30) because of their use of larger high performance CCDs in those models (which made these cameras much better able to work in HI-ISO mode needed to make this feature effective), but unfortunately the S700 uses the same tiny 1/2.5 inch size CCD as their competition, so it's `hi-iso' performance is not on a par with Fuji's earlier offerings and does NOT make the `image stabilizer' mode very effective.In fact, because of the tiny 1/2.5 CCD used by nearly all these compact 10:1 and 12:1 superzooms, former Fuji F30 users seeking to upgrade will probably be VERY disappointed in the low-light shooting performance, and would be much better off trying to catch a sale on something like the Fuji S6000FD (which I see selling now for only about $265 after a 50 dollar rebate) or a low end DLSR like the Nikon D40 (the D40 has a CCD with literally 10 times the surface area of the one used in the s700 which let's it take great shots in natural light all the way up to ISO 1600).", "Date": "May 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - Amazing Value", "Author": "Spencer", "ReviewID": "R1OKWNWNUZV2AU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a camera with better picture quality than a compact camera, manual options and lots of settings, ease of use, but yet nowhere near SLR price.

I use a UV filter and a flexible rubber lens hood to both protect the lens and eliminate sources of \"flare\" in harsh sunlight- a shape, weight, and balance make it easy to shoot at lower than normal shutter speeds and still get sharp photos.  At 380mm, I'd normally shoot at 1/500 of a second to ensure a sharp photo.  With this camera, I can shoot at 1/125 of a second with the zoom at 380mm and get a sharp photo.What is the S700/S5700 NOT good at?  It is a mediocre camera for people who simply want to put their camera in \"auto\" mode, and snap away.  In the \"auto\" mode, the S700/S5700 often uses an ISO of ISO 400, or ISO 800 in dim light, or when high shutter speeds are required and the resulting high ISO photo have mediocre sharpness, detail, and color quality.There are dozens of \"owner options\" detailed in the camera's manual, and the quality of photos you obtain is directly related to how much time is invested in learning and mastering each option.For folks who actually need a zoom that extends out to 380mm (for sports photography, or for bird watching) and for someone who wants to spend under $200 AND for folks who insist on having total control over all aspects of each photo, there is simply no other $200 camera that compares with the S700/S5700.

I also love that you can plug it into your tv and bam! your own slide show. I really don't see any major flaws in the camera and has turned me into a lover of Fujifilm cameras.As for the negative reviews, I respect everyone's opinion and do not want to be disrespectful but it seems a tad unfair to rate a camera poorly when the reviews came from people who used it just for a few DAYS. It can take time to learn a camera and it doesn't sound like these people even bothered to learn all the camera settings and it's abilities. Every complaint I can understand because it took me a little while to get over some of the hurdles that were mentioned but it was mainly due to the fact that I just need some time to get to know my camera. I guess I feel that in the end these reviewers are losing out on an excellent camera that is well worth the price. Is it going to take the same pictures as a high end professional $1000 camera? Probably not but for the money this camera is well worth it with some wonderful features I couldn't find on other budget cameras.Bottom line? It is great for those midlevel photographers who want a good camera with some cool features without the insanely high prices of similar cameras. And the \"natural\" setting is by far my favorite.

I have had it for a little under a month now. It has several distinct advantages over my old Olympus.A few reasons I love this camera (not an inclusive list):1. This camera has a fixed lens, where my Olympus extended the lens when it powered up (and complained bitterly if you forgot to take the lens cap off). Yes, it's a small thing, but it makes a difference.2. The lens cap has a cord that attaches it to the camera so you don't lose it. Yes, it's another small thing, but I can't tell you how many times I've lost the one for my previous camera.3. The 10x optical zoom is EXCELLENT and I'm having a lot of fun with that.4. It uses normal AA batteries - which means, if your batteries run out in the middle of the day, you can get replacements almost anywhere.My complaints:1. The autofocus for close-up shots is a little quirky. Maybe it's just that I haven't gotten used to it. It does fine if you're within an inch of the object, or several feet away and zooming all the way in. In between, it's a little quirky.2. The menu explanations can get annoying. They appear for a couple of seconds after changing a setting. After using the camera for a day, you don't really need them, but there doesn't seem to be a way to turn them off.3. There are so many little buttons all over it, I keep accidentally activating them as I take it out of my camera case.4. There are no instructions (that I can find) on how to format the card with the camera.This is not a compact pocket camera. I don't list that as a complaint because I wasn't looking for a pocket camera.I had little trouble getting the free 1GB card offered by Amazon, although it wasn't intuitive that you had to first add the card to your cart, then put in a promotional code to take the price of it off the total. It is an SD card, and I have had no trouble transferring photos between the camera and computer. It stores over 1100 photos.Lastly, I would recommend a card reader for anyone who doesn't have one. Forget about cables, and directly connecting the camera to the computer, and running down your camera batteries while downloading. Better yet, get an internal multi-card reader; you can cut down on peripheral clutter and probably use it for years to come.", "Date": "June 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Hobby camera", "Author": "M.

I looked at SLRs and other point and shot cameras.  Price was not a main factor.  After reading specs on so many cameras, I opted for the Fuji S700.  I received it last week, and all I can say is WOW !!!Here is a little overview of what I have experienced so far.......The camera is lightweight and can fit in a regular size purse.  It is not going to be like one of the slimline cameras, but the lens is so great, it is worth the tradoff of having a bit of a larger camera.- The camera is designed so well that you can use it with one hand.  The grip is great.- All the features are easy to access.- The quality of the pictures are exceptional.  I printed some pictures and did not even have to edit them at all.- I have taken pictures in low light, in the sun, people in motion; I was indoors at an event way up in the mezzanine and was able to zoom in and take action shots with no blur.  I was blown away.- There are enough options on this camera for different scenes, such as landscape, sports (for action shoots), sunset, beach, portrait, night, etc.  You should really work with these as they are great and make a difference in the pictures.  Also, there is picture stabilization for extended zoom, although I have done a lot of zooming without it and did not experience any blur.- The movie feature is wonderful.  I took several movies of my grandchildren playing outside, running around and they were perfect.- Playback and erasing on the camera is simple, and playback on the TV is easy and good quality viewing also.- The LCD is a nice size and very clear.  At the beach in the sun it is a bit difficult to see the LCD screen sometimes, so I switched to the View Finder with a press of a button.  (You can adjust the LCD brightness also, but I have not really tried working with this yet).Although I would rather use the many settings available on this camera for different scenes and the automatic setting too, the camera also has all the features for manual shooting (to set Aperture, Shutter speed, etc.) for more adavanced photographers.I have never gotten such good pictures on any other camera I have owned (and they were all much more expensive than this camera!)As I mentioned, I only have the camera about a week, and am thrilled with the results.

Abrahante \"JT_StPaul\"", "ReviewID": "R2E64O84K6SZUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a proud owner of a Canon A80 for about 4 years and well with all the new bells and whistles coming on the newer cameras I decided to purchase a new one.  The main reason to upgrade was inability to sometimes crop and print good quality images at 8x10. After reading and re-reading plenty of reviews on mostly long zoom cameras I narrow down the race to the Canon S3, Kodak Z712, Panasonic FZ8 and the Fuji S700 which was the one I end up purchasing.The reasons behind my decision were mostly influenced by reviews, price, and AA battery compatibility. I did however consider seriously getting the Canon S3.I have been using this camera for about 9 days and my first reaction was to return it after I uploaded my first batch of 50 pictures into my computer. However, since I had two weeks to change my mind I decided to READ the Manual and try different settings... The results I obtained were Amazing!I would give the camera a 4.5 but since there is no such option and I really like the camera I would give it a 5. Here is a summary of my Fuji S700 experience:***Low Light Conditions:If you decide to take pictures indoors under low light using the Image Stabilization, Portrait ,\"Party\" or any other preset mode, you will waste space on your memory card. The ISO under these conditions is elevated to at least 800 or sometimes 1600 making the picture NOISY. How noisy? Well let's just say that even a 4X6 print looks bad (I try). There are several programs you can use to remove some of that noise, but really who wants to do that? In order to avoid all that hassle you just need to use either Shutter Priority or Manual mode and \"play\" with the shutter speed or white balance until you get ideal conditions for your shot. Seriously, is not like it will take you 15 minutes to do that, in say less than 1 minute I was able to get it ready to go. Btw, Make sure to select ISO to either 64 or 100.***Good lightning conditions or Outdoors:Under outside conditions the preset buttons give very sharp and excellent pictures, most of the time. However, you should always pay attention to the ISO since in many of these modes the ISO is in Auto Mode and it might \"boost\" the image making it a mediocre image. I found that my sharpest pictures were taken at either ISO 64 or 100. Contrary to my old Canon which had a switch to preview and one for taking pictures, the S700 has a button that allows you to quickly access pictures taken. Futhermore, should you need to take a picture while you review images all you need to do is press the shutter and the camera returns to \"shoot\" mode.***Aren't Fuji Cameras supposed to be superb under low light conditions?Well if you are like me that assumed all Fuji cameras are the same you are up for a surprise. The S700 does not have the Super CCD that apparently provides an advantage at high ISO settings, however compared to my old Canon A80 the Fuji S700 provides better pictures (less noise) at higher ISO settings.***ZoomThe 10X zoom of this camera works wonders. I was afraid that without optical image stabilization I was going to get blurry pictures at full zoom, however that's has not been the case, a combination of the body/weight of the camera makes it easy to hold the camera steady enough to take a blur free picture. In addition I always make sure to increase the shutter speed to at least 1/100 of a sec.***LCDI know I know, who cares about the LCD, well I do! Having a 2.5\" LCD with 230,000 pixels really rocks. You can get a pretty good idea of how your picture is going to look based on this preview. Again be aware that if the picture is taken at a high ISO you will not be able to tell on this LCD.Finally, After 400's pictures and counting I am extremely pleased with the S700 and would recommend it to those who would like to purchase a camera capable of producing excellent pictures if you read the manual.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "just get it already", "Author": "rock of ages", "ReviewID": "RTMPSRSWHYJXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my job 6 weeks ago, and it is awesome! It got a good writeup in one of the computer magazines, so I took the plunge. The few negative remarks listed below are mostly unfamiliarity with the product or cameras in general. \"the shutter is too loud\" for example...you can easily turn the sound down or off completely. The optical zoom is great; two settings you can customize on the 'wheel' and just go directly to it. I use the SD card which I had already, but would like to give the XD card a try if they come down in price a little. The strap that comes with it is nothing special; you can get a third party replacement for around $20 if you want, which will come with quick release tabs, which can be handy sometimes. As far as transferring; I use it with my laptop which comes with a built in card reader. If you have a PC without a reader, it would be well worth the small investment in one; typically corded USB transfers of pictures are sloooow.

I loved the big clear LCD screen, and the eye level view-finder worked great also.  But I had a big problem with the auto focus. I finally just sat in my office and took photos of my book case over and over. A few would be a OK, but most would be way out of focus.  I sold my little Canon S2 IS yesterday (after receiving the Fuji from Amazon), and in my experience it was a far better camera. The only draw back for me was the tiny view-finder, the very small LCD screen, and the ISO 400 limitation. To bad Canon did not address these issues with the new S3 IS. One thing for sure though, Amazon was absolutely great with the return...it was breeze. I boxed it back up, and it's all ready to go back in the AM. Maybe I just got a bad one, maybe one made on a Monday? I was pleased, however, to see that Amazon was also offering the Canon SD800 IS today for only $172.00.

However, I was pleasantly surprised by its performance. I like to take photos, and am competent when it comes to zooming and changing basic settings (nothing too technical!). This camera has many different shooting modes, including beach, fireworks, portrait, etc. with a turn of the wheel on top, it produces just the right tones in the picture. Outdoor/nature pictures are simply amazing. There are alternate settings which let advanced users make specific changes (ISO, Aperture), but I don't use those at all. That's what's so great about this camera--advanced users can change settings to their liking, while beginners like me can just let the camera decide on the best setting with 'auto' mode. The zoom is better than any other camera i've ever tried. Cameras these days usually only have 3x optical zoom. What is the point of buying some 10 megapixel camera if the zoom is totally inefficient? The S700 boasts 10x optical zoom, which comes in useful when taking pictures at the beach or at baseball games. No other camera in the market has this much zoom for this price. The 10x zoom pictures look like you're just a few feet away. The image stabilization feature is also great! There's too many good things to say about this camera.

At 10X zoom with a tripod, it will resolve many of the larger craters on the moon, althoughthe moon is only about 500 pixels in diameter at full optical zoom.It's great for wildlife. I have a picture of a swan with three cygnets taken about 100 ft. from the nest that is excellent.I like the quick review button, as well as the fact that the camera returns to shooting mode as soon as the shutter button is pressed.The auto mode is fine for general purpose point and shoot, but the anti-shake mode is a decided plus at the larger zoom settings.The menus are intuitive and all controls are conveniently placed.I've taken about 1000 pictures over two vacations plus done a lot of experimenting.The only lost pictures have been about three or four due to not waiting for a focus lock on the correct target zone, and about the same number when there was an un-noticed strongly reflecting peripheral object in the foreground in flash mode.Even though Auto works well, I like having the ability to control settings, particularly in available light situations. Shutter priority and flash off with auto ISO are good choices. The pictures tend to be grainy at ISO 800 and 1600 but even this beats losing a shot.Another plus is the dual memory card slot, since I have other cameras which use SD cards as well.I had no trouble transferring pictures from the camera to the computer with either memory.I've used 2500 maH Nickel-Metal-Hydride Rechargeables, and about 400 shotsper charge seems to be a good number.I would imagine from past experiencethat disposables would be good for about 100 shots.I have been really pleased with every aspect of the performance.

I am an artist, and I want a digital SLR, but I have to say this is the next best thing that I have found. I use the camera for personal use, reference photos for paintings, and for fine art photography.I have used my Fuji S700 to take photographs that have been giclee printed at sizes from 20x30 to 48x36 on canvas and fine art paper. They turned out very well. They look sharp and detailed.At my workplace, we have a Canon Rebel XT that I am allowed to use. The S700's images are comparable in a lot of cases, and sometimes even better. Of course, this has to do somewhat with the lens we have for the Canon and my less-than-perfect skills, but the point is that for significantly less money, the S700 can pull off some great shots if you can't afford an SLR.The super macro is a sweet feature. I do a lot with blowing up tiny details, and with a UV filter on I can literally have the subject resting on the glass and take close-ups. They don't all turn out, but what does is really nice.The video isn't bad. It records sound, zooms, and focuses on the fly all right. I'm not really into video, and this is more than adequate for me.Its drawbacks are definitely grainy images in low light, and the dreaded \"purple haze\" in high contrast situations. I have a UV filter on the camera, but the haze still appears. Sometimes it has difficulty focusing up close, and the manual zoom is ridiculously cumbersome. It's unusable, really. I have used other manual settings, and while they get the job done eventually, they are not very user friendly. Half the time, because you have to depress two buttons, one is not down all the way and you end up switching other settings like macro mode and LCD brightness.For a \"point-and-shoot\" this camera is exceptional. I took it to Istanbul for a week vacation, and it captured some amazing pictures. This is where that 10x zoom is invaluable. My husband and I took a boat tour where other tourists had their big DSLR rigs with telephoto lenses, and I was glad to only have the small s700 walking around all day in unfamiliar territory. In an art photo shoot, I would have loved to trade, but as a tourist, who wants to walk around with heavy camera equipment that cost thousands? Yet I came home with really good, descriptive pictures. The energizer rechargable batteries I had on the trip lasted the entire time, nearly 300 photos and seven days of heavy use.This camera does have it's shortcomings, but for $200, it is a viable alternative to a DSLR. When I finally shell out for a DSLR, this will still be my choice to bring to family gatherings, vacations, and out on the water.

It's pretty good with distant wide-angle focusing, and the super-macro setting works well if you're 0.5cm away from the subject... but I have a lot of trouble focusing while zooming in. (Notes: the zoom can only operate with normal and macro settings; super-macro is wide-angle only. And if you're unfamiliar with the term \"macro,\" that's what you use for close-up shots.)Apparently, if you want your subject to take up the entire frame, either you need to physically put your lens a couple millimeters away from the subject OR you can zoom in from across the room.  There is no middle ground.I had a few focusing troubles with my Nikon Coolpix 3200 3.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom, too, and I was excited that the Fuji had a manual focus.  My excitement was misplaced.  The manual focus is intended to deliberately make things BLURRY.Another annoying feature is the dial explanations.  Every time you twiddle the dial, a brief explanation of the dial setting appears on the screen for a couple seconds.  I'm sure this is fine and helpful when you're just starting out, but I've had this camera for a week, and I KNOW what the dial settings are now and don't need to waste the 2 seconds.  I can't find any way to turn this feature off.By default, the when you take a picture, it appears on the screen for 1.5 seconds.  If you don't have 1.5 seconds to spare, there is the option of NOT displaying the photo you just took on the LCD screen.  It doesn't totally eliminate shutter lag, but it helps a little.You need the memory card.  The internal memory of the camera only holds about 15-20 pictures (at 7MP).Now, despite all I've said, this camera isn't a COMPLETE waste of money.  The resolution is good, and I do like the 10x optical zoom when I need it, but I can't help feeling that these features could be found on other cameras.  I like the manual settings that allow you to control individual aspects of the picture (aperture, shutter speed, ISO speed, etc.), but again, I'm not sure any of these are unique to this camera.What is unique is the lack of moving parts.  The 10x optical zoom is all internal.This isn't a bad camera.

The S700 Fuji Finepix is not a professional camera, but it is a very good, no make that excellent, amateur camera.  If you like to fiddle with exposure, ISO, shutter speed and other settings, very few point and shoot cameras offer the choices this little beastie does.  If you want a simple point and shoot, you might be disappointed because sometimes the camera really cranks up the ISO in low light.  Surprisingly, though, even at ISO 1600 sometimes the shot gets made.  I have set the auto to ISO 400 maximum, but when using scene positions it overrides this.  So learn to use manual settings and (gasp) a tripod for low light pics.  The flash is very powerful for such a tiny camera.  I bought it mostly for long hikes and daylight landscapes, and I couldn't be happier.  So far, though, I've used it for everything including museums, restaurants, school music shows in a gym.

I bought the camera for the 10x zoom and I really have been happy with the lens quality especially for the price. Here is what I am unhappy with - I believe it is the camera software. The colors are not realistic - sky colors being too turquoise. When taking closeups of high contrast subjects there are choppy outlines (i.e. red rose white background). I believe it's the anti-aliasing algorithms that really stink.I would never blow the pictures up. What am I comparing it to? I have had a number of HP cameras (R927 & R817) which have great realistic colors and do excellent closeups. I was trying to replace the R817 which had 5x Pentax optical zoom, a rarity on point and shoot cameras and unfortunately is no longer made (my kid dropped it).

If you don't want the expense of additional lenses and the hassle of changing them, this camera might be for you. I previewed (hands-on) similar cameras of various brands prior to purchasing this one but have owned no others like it so I cannot give a comparison, but I have owned and used this camera for 5 months now and am extremely well pleased with it. Most of my photos are outdoor shots, and in nature, the 10x zoom is fantastic. The camera has the look and feel of a DSLR, so handling is quite steady. It will do the simplest point-and-shoot, or go full manual for those with a desire to experiment.One feature that was important to me was the ability to accept a filter and this camera does it very nicely (with a Hoya filter installed, the factory lens cap works well). The zoom lens does not move outside the camera and this feature is one that appeals to me, unprotected precision moving parts are a problem waiting to arise. Neckstrap and viewfinder were two other features that I also wanted and the S700 has both. Most of my photos are taken using the viewfinder, but the LCD is real handy at times and is quite large and clear. With cold, dry hands out doors, the grip on this model is superb, unlike a lot of the more compact slippery cameras out there.If you are looking for a camera to slip in your pocket or purse, keep looking, as this is somewhat bulky for that, but if you don't mind a reasonably small case slung over your shoulder, a Case Logic TBC-4 is nearly a glove-fit for the S700.Once you get used to the location of the function buttons, all are quite easily accessed and simple to operate, I like the slightly recessed on-off button, because I don't have to worry about inadvertantly turning the camera on when stowing it, as was a problem with my previous unit.I am not a professional or advanced amateur photographer but I am very pleased with photo quality I'm getting out of my S700 and the simplicity of operation... The price is just a great bonus.The only feature I wish this camera had is a remote shutter release, but with that being said, I would highly recommend this camera for those out there looking to upgrade from your basic point-and-shoot to something a little more advanced without having to take out a second mortgage on the house.", "Date": "November 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent, versatile, kidproof camera!", "Author": "K.

The S700 also takes wonderful video with very good sound -- and I love having the ability to zoom while shooting video.This is only my second digital camera -- the first was a Canon A630.

These two attributes make it very kidproof. It's a sturdy camera and I personally like the fact that it's bigger than a \"point and shoot.\" I love the sturdy grip.I'm definitely a \"hobby\" photographer although I do take some photos in my work.

The 2650 vids don't even have sound, but not only does this camera shoot sound videos:  the sound isn't completely overwhelmed in noisey situations.  I was able to capture a video of a guy proposing to his girl on stage at the concert and then contact them later and offer them the video... they replied back that they will be using it at their wedding reception.So... it's a good camera, but it's not as impressive as they made it look 6 mos ago (I mean, look how much the price has already gone down in that time).I'm ready to get serious with my photography and this camera just isn't going to keep up.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "A marvel in form and function!", "Author": "mr.arv", "ReviewID": "R1WLSBUY5YNPGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will Second the review that calls for TEN STARS for this wonderful camera! I first discovered this camera on display in a Electronics Dept. of a major retailer and I explored its features. I was very impressed with what I thought was a lot of potential! The overwhelming majority of reviews here were Five Stars. And with good reason! This camera is a wonder! The focus is fantabulous, the resolution is dazzling, and the exposures are borderline magical. The 10X optical zoom  is sharp and clear, and the extra 4.8X digital zoom is startlingly very good! I have had my mind blown repeatedly by the wonderful lighting that this camera so beautifully captures. I should also mention that, unlike other digital cameras, the Fuji FinePix S700 does not inhale or drain its 4 AA batteries after a few shots. I have taken multiple dozens of photos with and w/o a flash, and it is still going strong! Now, I don't mean to be mean, but I can't help but think the negative critics of this dream machine (a negligible minority) either have not read the manual, they did not understand what they read, or they don't know what a camera like this one is capable of. This camera marvellously responds to its programming and design.If you buy a BMW because you want a high performance vehicle. you will have one. But if you try to take a high-speed turn on wet pavement, and you skid through the guard rail and plunge into a deep ravine, don't blame the car: learn how to drive, first! Learn how a car, high performance or otherwise, was made to respond in and to its environment, and under all circumstances.This camera was designed and built with a photographer in mind: A photographer who values and knows how to use a responsive and beautifully designed camera that is in its element where fine photography is concerned.

Helm", "ReviewID": "R2AJT3SH020O9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me begin that I have had several digital cameras over the years. I gave my SLR film camera and equipment to a friend and I now use digital only. I learned more about photography in my first week with digital than I ever learned with film. The reason for this is the instant feedback that you get with digital. I like the full AUTO mode but rarely use it. I much prefer the manual settings for taking the pictures the way I want them to look. The Finepix allows for total manual operation. Even as far as adjusting for the type of light available. (Sun, cloudy, florescent, incandescent, etc.) It also allows for  a fairly wide range of ASA settings. You make your adjustments, snap the shot, and instantly see the results on the display screen. Excellent learning opportunities that you don't have with film. The Finepix has lots of bells and whistles that you  want from a digital short of interchangeable lenses as with an SLR. (BTW - there are threaded filters and lenses that can be purchased for the Finepix that work quite well) The Finepix takes great pictures in all types of light and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the pictures when in full optical zoom. I take a lot of pictures from the balcony of my church. Musical dramas and other children choir programs. The distance being too far for flash use but I get great pictures. The only way you will do better is to pay a lot more for an SLR digital camera. My wife has a Pentax SLR digital and yes it takes better pictures but with the flash and an extra telephoto lens, it cost over $700!  My Finepix cost me a little over $160. I installed nothing extra to my computer and when I connect the camera, XP and Vista will instantly recognize and allow me to download the pictures. I am very happy with the camera and I am still discovering new things that this camera will do. The book that came with the Finepix is thick and helpful. Another bonus with the Finepix is that it uses standard AA batteries. I use rechargables but in an emergency, any AA battery will work.

The extra boost in brightness can really come in handy.I have had a problem with the the flash getting stuck, but a quick tap opens it up.This camera also leaves alot to be desired. The auftofocus is spotty and the manual focus is unuseable, unless shooting static photos like flowers. It can be very difficult to focus at times, especially in macro mode.I have missed several shots because the camera takes long to focus or for the picture to be taken.

It's kind of an underdog camera, but it has lots of pros and cons, and if you know how to work it's pros, you can take some seriously cool pictures.Pros:* Getting cheaper every year* Has great zoom lens* If you set to 'super macro' it can focus on pretty much anything no matter how close you get it to the lens (my favorite option)* Takes great pictures with flash* Stores pictures fast* Uses normal sd cards!* Looks attractive, people take it serious when they see it* Has normal tripod screw hole underneath* Decent display* Lots of fun menu options and settings* Lots of different modes to set camera in* Point and shoot! This can also be a con, some people don't like point and shoot. I do, so for me that's a Pro! I like that I don't have to spend 20 minutes to set up for a single shot, I don't have that kind of time.Cons:* Grainy photos unless used with adequate light.* Getting old* Only 7.1mp (which for me is plenty, but you might be a megapixel nut and desire more)* Is not dslr* I don't think it supports SD HC so you can't use bigger than 2gb memory cardsMy favorite shooting settings to use with this camera are: Anti-shake, 2 shots at one time (one with flash, one without flash), and Macro/Super Macro. One unfortunate thing is when you're in Super-Macro mode it will not allow you to use flash, probably because this washes out the subject totally. A workaround for this is to use a flashlight or even your cell phones light if you have one that you can turn on. That's what I do, I get real close to my subject, turn on my Android's light, and I breathe life and color into my photos that way.I have owned 4 fujifilm finepix cameras, some newer than this model, and I have to say.. they nailed it with this s700, some of their newer models have more megapixel, but something happened to the way it processes the image and it actually looks WORSE. I noticed other people felt the same way as I was reading on some forums. Many people said they wished they just had their s700 back.

With a 46mm to 52mm or similar adapter you can also attach other toys like a cheap fisheye and get a lot of fun and creative mileage out a very cheap total package.Pros: Inexpensive, light, compact, lens threaded for filters, good for macro, lots of manual features, some very useful pre-sets (sunset, night, snow, etc)Cons - the manual focus function is terrible - it works, but is extremely cumbersome to use and slow.  Fortunately the auto-focus is good enough that you rarely need it.  Images get grainy really fast anywhere north of ISO400.

After receiving a 2GB memory card from my sister (who also owns this camera,  she purchased hers after I did!) the videos I have taken are fun too! I like the large viewing screen (a mandatory requirement for me!) and the option to switch from the viewing screen to the viewfinder is nice too - many digital cameras do not have this feature.  I have taken incredible close-up photos with this camera.  It does take patience to learn about the features - when I purchased the camera, it was identified as a mid-level camera (in terms of professionalism) so I never expected it to be a simple thing to use.  I'm still finding out details after two years!  One of the most joyous things I've discovered about having a digital camera is that young kids love to view the photos of themselves immediately after the photo is taken.But sadly, on Thanksgiving evening, the flash on my S700 decided to stop popping up.  I guess I'm lucky I got two years out of the auto flash since some of the other reviewers only got a year or year and a half.  The flash problem is ironic for me as I have a tendency to drop my cameras and break them - only this time that wasn't the case! Actually I've been pretty careful with this camera (my second Fuji camera - I dropped the first one, of course).So now I'm not sure what I am going to do.  The camera is currently priced about $70 more than what I paid for it, I have many XD memory cards so that limits any future purchases for me (I don't want to switch card types), and I had hoped to purchase different lenses for this camera someday.  I will probably continue to use the camera by holding the flash up manually (I can do this, it's lots of fun - not), although before the flash broke I liked that the camera would decide when the flash was necessary so I didn't have to think about that if I didn't want to.  I still recommend this camera, but I'm only rating it at four stars because of the flash problem.  But who knows - maybe other people (like my sister!) won't have the flash problem with their S700s.Update 01/06/10: My husband bought me for Christmas (from my Amazon wish list, of course, I had forgotten this was on my list) a multiple lens package for this camera so I am going to stick with it.  I've just been manually holding the flash up to take pictures - I received a great recommendation from a comment so I will probably follow it by searching for someone to repair it or just find a way to permanently have the flash in the up position.  I like buying new items (it's just one of my quirks) so I'll periodically check the price on this camera in case it drops (I can dream, can't I?).Update 06/03/11: Last month I went with my precious S700 camera to a neighbor's house, and when I entered their dog knocked the camera out of my hands.  Even though it was in its case, the screen cracked on the camera.  I can use the camera via the viewfinder but find it difficult, especially when using the movie mode.  So now I am sad to say I must say so long to my S700, it has really been a fantastic camera for me.

It does not have the feature that allows you to take a wide-angle (panoramic) photo.  Some other compact digital cameras do have that feature, but I did not know this until after I had already received my camera.Two other things about this camera that are a little bit disappointing are that it will not accept the Lithium Ion battery that I have read gives a better longer-lasting performance than the NiMH batteries that this camera accepts.  The Lithium Ion battery would also be more convenient because it is just one battery whereas this camera takes 4 AA batteries which can be a bit of a hassle to change.The third thing that might be a tiny bit disappointing about this camera is that I think it might only hold a memory card with no larger memory than 2 GB.  I am not certain because the literature included with the camera does not indicate otherwise.  For photos this is sufficient, but for videos it would be beneficial to have a larger memory capacity.As for the GOOD things about the camera...- the SIZE of the camera itself is PERFECT for me.  It is large enough to hold onto.  I do not like the tiny cameras because they are difficult to hold and manipulate the buttons, at least for me...I guess I have large hands.  With this one, it is easier to hold the camera steady while shooting.  It will not fit in your pocket, however, unless you have huge jacket pockets perhaps.- It is VERY lightweight for its size.- The lens is all enclosed within the camera body so the lens does not move forward and back outside the camera, which I like; it's not as obvious to others that you are zooming in.- The photo quality is phenomenal.  This camera takes very high quality shots simply by leaving it set on AUTO all of the time!- You can attach filters to the front of the lens; there are threads that allow you to do this.  Not all cameras of this type have this feature.- There are many manual setting options if you prefer to set up your own perameters.- The view screen on the back is very large.- There is a separate view finder for those outdoor bright shots that make the screen almost impossible to see.- The camera comes with an actual printed Owner's Manual booklet!  (179 pages of instructions, tips and trouble-shooting advice)I am mostly very pleased!

I own the finepix 5200 and wanted the same optical zoom capability with this newer camera. The lens is actually shorter, making it smaller in your hands, but maintains the 10X optical zoom. The 7 megapixel resolution was also an upgrade. I actually paid less for this finepix S700 than for my 5200. The only drawbacks are that the contrast ratio is not as good. What I mean is that when photographing sports (ie soccer) under stadium lighting against a dark sky, the faces are overexposed. I am also a little disappointed that the action photography is more blurry than with my finepix 5200. I am not sure why this is. I have a phone number for Fuji and plan to discus this with somebody at the company.

The camera has performed as expected and has shown me excelent results for my needs.  I chose this larger camera to allow me to better to grip it.  It looks and feels like a profesional camera.  I have had great battery life.  I am using Radio Shacks 1.2v, 2100mAh batteries I purchased with the camera.  I very infrequently need to recharge them.  I use the LCD display and very often the flash and have never had to change the batteries mid-shoot.  I took action photos of the puppies that turned out great.  The shoot speed (from shoot to shoot) is not too bad (about 2 secs with the flash).  It also has a sequential shoot feature that works ok.  I use a SanDisk 4gb SDHC card and use that to transfer pictures from the camera to the computer using the included software.  Other photo software, like Picasa, works also.  I find the resolution, using it as a point and shoot camera, to be adequate for my needs.  The photos I take with the FPs700 is as good as any photo I took using various 35mm film cameras (only I can take hundreds of extra pictures with the digital camera).  I can take clear pictures that can be zoomed to see more detail.  I do have one problem;  there is a spec of debris on the lense below the outer lense.

For a mid-priced camera it was a great deal. And we are really happy with it.We wanted something that we could use as an easy point-and-shoot camera AND have enough features and quality to do occasional photos for our business. We had a $200 budget (but paid only $160 on Amazon). It was one of the cameras that CR liked and, so far at least, the S700 can do almost everything we need it to.  It is fairly light and easy to hold with one hand. The basic controls (like shutter, zoom and mode settings) are easy to use. The LCD seems fairly bright and you can use the viewfinder when there is bright sunlight. Some reviewers mentioned that it is easy to get fingerprints on the LCD which I did at first. I downloaded and read the instruction manual pdf before we went to look at it at an actual store. They wanted $229 for the same camera that day so we didn't buy it there.The AUTO setting (for point and shoot photos) does a decent job especially if there is good light. When the camera decides to use a higher ISO and the photos have more grain (noise). The Image Stabilization feature uses a higher ISO also. I've only used it a few times but so far the shots have been very good. The best photos I take will generally be the ones shot at the lowest ISO like 64 or 100 with good lighting just like with our old camera. But life, people and pets move and our hands shake as we get older. So we need flash and those higher shutter speeds and ISO speeds to get decent shots and this camera delivers that.A great thing about the S700 is that it has pretty much most of the settings you could want. Some are preset combinations like Snow, Landscape or Portraits that are really easy to use. One setting I use fairly often is the N/ flash. This takes two photos right in a row. The first one uses the available light and the second photo uses the flash. It has the same limitations as the Auto setting but usually one of the two shots is better. Searching deeper in the menu area you can change things like the light balance, whether to use the digital zoom or not, the flash type and intensity, and whether to bracket shots. I've shot a few video clips that have been OK. Again if the lighting is good and bright it is a lot more forgiving. You can zoom while recording. The microphone does pick up some of the lens auto-focusing sounds. I've experimented with a lot of the settings but I've barely scratched the surface. The macro and super macro are great too.Minor complaints: The long zoom is great. But I wish it started a little wider than 38mm (equivalent). On our Nikon I use a 28mm and a 20mm most of the time. But that is just me and most people need the telephoto more. The software that comes with it is only ok. We just use it to transfer the images and videos to our Mac. Then we use PhotoshopCS3.We've only had the camera a few weeks but so far we love it.", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Overall Good Value for the Money", "Author": "Thomas N.

I've been using my Kodak advantix that I got for a christmas present back in 1996 or so. The reason I was looking into finally getting with the times and buying a digital camera is I was tired of my flaws with film - wanting to develop the film so having to take a bunch of pictures to use up the film so I could process it, developing the film and some pictures just not being the best pictures and therefore wasting money on prints, and since I don't have kids yet or travel I don't take pictures that often so the film in the camera gets so old that my pics come out fuzzy, another waste of money. My #1 priority on whatever camera I get is it absolutely must take wonderful indoor pictures without flash - I have 4 cats and people with cats know about the glowing yellow and green eyes in pics instead of seeing their beautiful green or blue eyes, and no red eye reducer has ever worked on cat eyes for me. Channel flipping one day, HSN had this camera on it and they mentioned it took great night pictures and pictures indoor with no flash. I spent the next couple of days looking at reviews online and the reviews were great. I was also looking at the canon powershot, but read too many reviews mentioning blurry pictures, a big turn off. I went to a camera store to play around with the Nikon coolpix, canon powershot, and this camera. The salesperson recommended the canon because he loved his, but the features on the fugi seemed so great, plus an older gentleman came by and saw my camera and he said he had an older one and it took just wonderful pics, so I went with it and bought it. I did give the camera 4 stars because with the flash on, it does take wonderful crisp pictures of my kitties (and humans), but without the flash, the pictures are not clear at all. I am torn, after playing with the camera, I love the features and it's so easy to use and get comfortable with, I love the feel, plus the batteries last so long, as compared to other cameras I've heard about. I've taken about 400 pictures so far and the batteries are still going strong. I would like to get another camera but don't know which kind to get. The 10X zoom is keeping me attached - I would hate to go back to 3X or 4X after the 10X, but the inside pics with no flash is really bothersome. So anyways, if you don't have cats, then I would totally recommend this camera.

Being a new camera, we were very careful that it didn't get wet or sit in the sun, but several days into our trip, to my great heartbreak, it suddenly would not turn on.  I contacted Fuji when we got back.  Over the phone they explained that using regular AA (non-rechargeable) batteries would often cause the internal battery to fail and that this was probably the problem but I would have to wait and find out.  After a very long wait (4+ weeks) I was informed that the inside of the camera was corroded.  They would not honor the warranty.  I explained that, although Jamaica is a very humid island, it was never exposed to water.  Several phone calls, many unreturned messages, and giving them a deadline before I would contact the Better Business Bureau later, I was finally able to speak with a supervisor and asked whether taking it to a humid area would void the warranty.  He admitted that simply the humidity probably had done this damage but explained that since there was corrosion they couldn't help me.  They did offer me to \"trade up to a different model\" using their \"loyalty program\" (which one would assume would mean getting some value for the old camera), but in reality this didn't save me very much money at all.  I was simply purchasing a refurbished camera directly from Fuji at a slight discount from the new-camera price (to my recollection this was maybe 15% or so).  I begrudgingly opted to do this because I couldn't afford another brand new camera and needed one and got a new (refurbished) S700.  This also meant that camera #2 would have no warranty.S700 #2:  Approximately a year later, I uploaded some pics.  When I went to use the camera again, this one also is completely dead.  It will not turn on.  I tried charging my batteries, then purchased new rechargeable batteries, charged them up, but nothing.  This camera never went anywhere near a humid country or anything.  I contacted Fuji again and was informed that I will have to mail it in at my cost, wait 4 weeks, and they will contact me by snail mail with an estimate which I can choose to accept or deny.  :-(C'mon Fuji, you can do better than this.

It does a lot for the money but before I bought this one I owned another finepix, the S5000 with Super CCD and the quality of the pictures are not comparable (even that S5000 it has only 3.1 Mega Pixels).Secondly, the body of the camera it doesn't feel \"solid\" but \"plastic\". So after a week of having this camera I decided to sell it and buy a Finepix S600Fd, what is a totally different product. My 2 cent advice is that with 100 dollars more (if you have) go for something that feels almost like a DSLR.check this link:Fujifilm Finepix S6000fd 6.3MP Digital Camera with 10.7x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom with Picture Stabilizationthis is a real incredible camera (S6000fd) for the price... one step before a DSLR!", "Date": "August 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not very good pics", "Author": "D.

Without the flash completely opening, you get no flash at all. I have crammed a piece of paper in the camera to hold the flash open all the time.
