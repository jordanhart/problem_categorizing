Every aspect is manageable via web for headless operation. Supports external drives for backup. Recorded video looks great, very smooth and sharp (live view read below). 16 ch on motion sense only uses 200 gigs a month (2TB drive). Motion sense is very easy to set up. Recording options are plenty-full and a breeze to setup. Multiple user accounts with varied permissions. iPhone app works wonderfully. Recently updated web-server now supports chrome and safari using webkitCon: Very deep, Hard to fit in shallow cabinets. No keyboard support, Only mouse. Live view is choppy and pixelated. Video review could use some work, Not hard, But not the easiest thing to manage. You must set DST up or time stamp on video and system time will always be off and make it very hard to find events based on time.other: I have always chosen LTS for my DVR installs. never had an issue with the 20+ setups I have done.
