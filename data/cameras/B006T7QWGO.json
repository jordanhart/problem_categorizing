It was a great camera but the 36X zoom was impossible to control without a tripod. I photograph birds in central Pennsylvania and needed a camera that was capable of taking quick shots while on the move. I had a Panasonic Lumix with an 18X zoom but wanted something a little stronger. The Fuji S4200 meets all of my requirements. I love the simplicity of the contols as well as their locations. Finally got the perfect shot of a tufted titmouse that was nearly fifty yards away. The only things I can gripe about are the location of the card slot which is inside the battery compartment and the strap holding lugs which are too small for a heavy padded camera strap. Did I mention the price which was low enough to counter the problems?", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "FujiFilm Finepix S4200 Camera First Look", "Author": "king", "ReviewID": "R28TM1W3K32JBG",

"Content": "We were shopping for an upgrade to your typical digital snapshot camera and settled on this at reasonable cost. It has loads of features we wanted such as continuous shooting, easily switches between the eyepiece and rear screen, the body is large enough with enough heft to it that you know you're holding something, even with my huge hands it was comfortable to hold and controls are easily manipulated.Anyone that is familiar with the basics of using a real film camera should find most controls and settings fairly intuitive with no need to spend a week reading the manual.Did I mention that this camera takes really gorgeous pictures for something in its price range? A couple of examples.... we wanted to get some shots of our bull terrier ( Spud McKenzie type dog) in full stride, running with all 4 paws off of the ground, this camera nailed it! In continuous mode you can shoot I believe up to 40 pics in seconds and then go pick out your fav on your computer to portray exactly the look that you wanted. The lense captures detail that will amaze you! A simple snapshot taken of our dog from 10 ft away can be cropped and blown up on the home pc to the point where you can clearly see 1 single hair laying across the corner of his eye in the photo.Another example... while sitting out on the patio, a squirrel ran across our back fence about 60 ft away, we grabbed 2 quick snapshots as he ran with no zooming on the lense... later that day while perusing the pics we'd shot that morning on the pc, cropped and zoomed in on the squirrel and the detail that emerged was shocking in its clarity! Where the naked eye saw a gray blob running on the fence the camera caught up close and personal details of individual markings on his face and body even down to his cheek bone structure and other fine facial details.Other reviews have cited the fact that there is no readily available power source other than onboard battery power to download from the camera to your pc, easily solved by taking the memory card and inserting in your pc! We have literally taken hundreds of pics so far on the original set of batteries.2 minor improvements that we'd recommend would be the addition of a hand grip carry strap to enable you to walk around with the camera poised in your hand to grab a quick pic or 2 and also add a carrying case of some sort", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "great still camera", "Author": "Bruce H.

It works great and the 14mp is a great improvement from my 5mp and it works in almost any light. Now the video is not all that great the HD says you can only record a little over 9 minutes and the picture is not too steady without a tripod. I like to mount my camera on the dash of my car and take videos while I am driving, I guess for that I will have to go back to my old camcorder. The 24X zoom works great for still photos, I can read license plates from almost 1/4 mile away.

This camera has a flash! I've read so many user reviews (and even a CNET review on another similar camera) that chastised it or a lack of flash. This camera has a pop-up flash that is so bright it takes clear pictures in near total darkness (of course at the point you don't know what you are seeing through lcd viewfinder...but still, lets put the flash debate to bed.EDIT: Have since played with the camera more and found that certain modes do not employ flash, and you can't force it to (limited but not included to baby mode (flash isn't great for babies) and panoramic mode where a flash would produce inconsistencies with lighting within the separate frames). The manual suggests you use \"SR Auto\" mode. I don't like that mode because it determines which preset (sport, sunset, night, fireworks, etc...) to use based on surroundings. I just go traditional auto mode. Flash fires without fail.Overall this is a great camera for the money. Remember though, it is a point and shoot. It looks like a fancy SLR camera but is not, so it shouldn't be knocked for quality compared to higher tiered cameras.The only cons I can think of are more nuisances than anything: 1) if you turn the camera on with the lens cap still on, you have to remove the cap and then turn camera off and then back on and 2) forgetting to open the flash, realizing after you've taken the picture that you needed it.This camera is fine for family photos and casual use. For that, it's amazing really. Don't expect to get by with it as your main camera for professional use. Enough with f/stops and everything, it takes great pictures for a point and shoot. With that being said, it may be useful to play around with the manual settings. A task I have yet to undertake.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera for anyone", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R3L0H27EBYDIZS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a birthday gift (though after much research  of other cameras/brands). This is a fantastic camera, it has the look and quality of the professional cameras, but is easy to use. It does not feel cheap, and is a great size.The 24X zoom is wonderful, and does not make a picture blurry.You can use the LCD screen for pictures, or the view finder, which can be very helpful on sunny days.One of my favorite shooting modes, is the natural light with flash. It takes two pictures, one without and one with flash. It takes a gorgeous photo of person/object in the foreground even with background lighting.The panorama shooting mode is a lot of fun, and the pictures come out great, especially for landscape shots. If you take a panorama shot of something close-up the middle of the picture is a bit fish-eyed.The burst shooting is so much fun! It took me a little while to find it (up next to the capture button), you can hold down the capture button while in this mode and take some amazing motion shots.I am going to be in Ireland for the next four months, and I am so excited to see how this camera performs. If I had to share something I didn't like about the camera, it would be that it is not a compact pocket travel size. But to be honest, I don't see that as being a problem.I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants a great quality camera and photos, but doesn't want to have to take a photography class to be able to use it.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Radioactive", "ReviewID": "R614WNBEUKNTG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera!

I bought it for a trip to several national parks and wanted to capture all of the wildlife as well as the beautiful natural landscapes.

The texturized grip is perfect for making sure you have the camera securely in hand. And I love that is uses AA batteries because I could easily replace them at the convenience stores while in the national parks.A previous reviewer said this camera takes blurry photos. It does - but only if you don't follow the directions. When using the telephoto lens, you have to press the button only half way down so it can focus. Then, press the button all the way down to take the picture. If you do that, the pictures are absolutely wonderful and crisp. Just take 2 minutes to read the directions and you'll be fine.Finally, the ability to take both panaramic views and HD movies is fabulous.

I am a complete novice to photography, both in technique and in hardware. With that said, let's begin.Prior to purchasing this camera, I tried to do my due diligence in researching it, as well as its competitors. My target was a feature-packed bridge/\"superzoom\" camera with a few advanced/manual options, and built-in flash. The desired price point was $200 or less. When all was said and done, it appeared to be a great choice.The Good:This camera offered a laundry list of features and shooting modes, built-in. Panorama, backlit portrait, night portrait, etc; a lot of nice presets for someone not particularly knowledgeable or skilled in photography. Add in a popup flash, 24x zoom, image stabilization, and other goodies, and you have the makings of a very nice device.The Bad:Even though it boasted a 16 megapixel resolution, the images produced were very grainy. This was true at different zoom distances, lighting conditions, and image capture stability situations (free hand, tripod, standing, kneeling, etc). Of course with the sensor being CCD (as opposed to CMOS), low light performance was tragic, at best. Even fiddling with settings (white balance, ISO, fstop, etc) made virtually no difference when it came to capturing a crisp, clear image.The Ugly, and Unforgivable:There was no flash, period. The built-in flash on this unit was the popup kind. Unlike most cameras, however, opening the flash was manual, rather than automatic (i.e. when the shutter button is pressed). Oddly enough, the flash would never fire, even in modes where it could be used. I discovered via the internet and the extended user's manual (read: not the little mini-manual that comes in the box) that not all shooting modes employ the flash. With the flash option set to auto, it would not fire (no matter how dark the area was where I shot. Furthermore, even with the flash mode set to fire on every shot, it would never do so. The last straw was, even where you set the camera so it had no choice but to use the flash, it seemed to disable the shutter! In short: flash on, shutter doesn't work; flash off, shutter works fine. After doing some more research after encountering this issue, I discovered that a number of others had the exact same experience. Wish I had known that sooner...Conclusion:Again, please take this review with a grain of salt. I am fully aware that there exists a possibility that my difficulties with this camera could have been purely the result of my own ineptitude. However, shortly after returning this item, I picked up another camera of a different brand (which I will not name here, as I'm not reviewing that device or trying to steer buyers toward it). I unboxed it, popped in some batteries and a memory card, and took some pictures. Cleaner pictures, less grain and image noise, and the kicker: the flash just plain worked! That said, I'm inclined to believe that it was the product that couldn't cut the mustard. However, for the possibility that my potential misuse may have resulted in poor performance, I gave it two stars instead of one.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great and well worth the price", "Author": "Tom Hanna \"tomhanna\"", "ReviewID": "RPCD5N1U4N7NL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I almost didn't buy this camera because of the negative reviews about \"graininess,\" poor low light function and flashes not working. In reverse order:My flash works just fine.On my first outing, I got some excellent night time pictures at ISO 100 and 200 with long enough shutter speeds. This did require using a tripod...that I bought for a dollar at Dollar Tree.Were those photos grainy?  Not in the least.  I did take some at ISO 1600 that were grainy.I'm not an expert photographer who knows just how to tweak any camera to get what I want. I spent about an hour online reading up on this jargon (shutter speed, f-stop, aperture, ISO) that a week ago was Greek to me. In that reading, I did learn that those ISO 1600 shots were going to be grainy.Will I want to upgrade to a DSLR and a suitcase of lenses at some point in the next couple of years?  It's highly likely. And that's as much because of the great results I'm getting from this camera as anything.All things considered, given that this camera has fully automatic settings that allow it to function as a \"point and shoot\" at 14 MP plus the modes with manual control all at a price comparable to a 14 MP point and shoot with a lower zoom....well, come on...How can this not be a 5-star review?", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Price for a camera close to an entry-level DSLR", "Author": "Eddie T. \"Video Shoots\"", "ReviewID": "R38IJR5OMGFPWZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is not an entry-level DSLR, but contains enough features that it will give you that feeling.

I can take hundreds of shots without changing batteries.  The pictures are very clear and it's easy to use. It even tells you if one of your subjects blinked when you take a shot and then zooms in to show you which one closed their eyes. That way you can take the picture again. This is a great feature as I've missed many shots in the past due to people closing their eyes. It also recognizes if a child smiles and automatically takes the picture so you don't miss the shot.

If you do not shoot with a DSLR this will be a step up from your compact camera and has both a wide variety of automatic and manual modes (especially good if you want to learn more about photography without the expense of the DSLR) I tend to take the Fuji places where I am unwilling to take my Olympus DSLR like on my kayak and when I go bike riding, etc. However, it lacks the color depth and richness of my Olympus.  It also has a tendency to overexpose,as I saw with my last Fuji, especially skies above darker tree lines.  There are two ways you can combat both negatives.  Since I am shooting in active situations I tend not to use the manual settings unless I need to control shutter speed, instead I use Program mode and shoot -.03 to -0.7.  The other thing you can do is choose the Chrome setting in the menu and what this basically does is up the saturation and contrast, you must be careful about using program and chrome modes together because you can end up with an image that is just as flat because of saturation as you can with an overexposure. (Which in a side note kind of reminded me of Fuji films back in the day) With this said I rather work from an over saturated image and lighten it, if I need to, than try to bring some color back to a sky or highlights.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera, great price", "Author": "KST", "ReviewID": "R22RYO89008SDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic bridge camera for the price.

I have only owned regular digital point-and-shoot cameras in the past.  With the recent birth of our son, we wanted to upgrade our camera to something better.  We looked at SLR cameras, but even the cheapest ones were more expensive than we were willing to pay.  We decided to get a \"bridge\" camera, and after pouring through reviews and feature lists we decided on the Fujifilm S4200.With both my wife and I being novices when it comes to photography, we wanted something that would take excellent pictures on Auto.  We are very pleased with the picture quality on Auto, the pictures are much more clear than any previous camera we've owned, and the flash is excellent.  Pictures taken with flash look great and don't have that blown out look that photos taken with flash do on cheaper cameras.  This camera is very intuitive and easy to use- the options are there if you care to delve into them, but if you're just looking for a camera that performs well out of the box, this fits the bill as well.I've taken close to 100 pictures over the last few days and the batteries are still going, so the battery life seems decent.  The camera itself is pretty light, and we really like the grippy textured rubber on the outside of the camera.  Pictures in low light and indoors are good, and it also takes pretty decent photos with the flash off.  The camera takes pictures fairly quickly, I think its about 3 or 4 seconds between shots which is pretty good judging by reviews I read for other cameras in the same class taking upwards of 10 seconds.  The 24x zoom is excellent as well, very cool feature.Overall I would definitely recommend this camera, but keep in mind that my wife and I are novice photographers and are just judging the picture quality and performance subjectively.

The features and stats were impressive in print, and when I did a hands-on test of several cameras at a store, this camera performed well.I realized that there would be a learning curve for this model (my last camera had lasted over seven years with heavy use, and I've been a photography enthusiast for over 25 years) but it's been two weeks and I cannot say that I'm overly impressed with the images from this camera.Nearly every picture taken requires editing with color correction/contrast and sharpness being the main issues.  I can accept that the sharpness may need tweaking to get the best out of an image, but having to correct the color all the time?  To me, this is not acceptable.  I reviewed pictures taken with my last camera (a Kodak) during the first couple weeks and there were no color issues present.  It seems that the majority of photos have a touch (at the very least) of yellow that is unattractive.  It doesn't matter what settings I use (or if I adjust the white balance), yellow seems to creep in.Photographs taken outside are slightly better.  With editing, the pictures can be extraordinary.  I like taking pictures of trees and clouds, and I was able to adjust the color balances in Photoshop to create beautiful images.This evening I sat down to experiment more with the various settings, and out of 107 photos (of fruit and nature), only 10 were acceptable (and probably would require Photoshop tweaking before sharing).  I didn't expect every photo to turn out perfect since I was experimenting, but for the majority of them to look pretty bad is disappointing.  I suppose it is an interesting point that when I took macro photos of a banana bunch, the yellow was washed out to the point that they looked tan in most shots (go figure, no yellow when it's appropriate).The software that comes bundled with the camera, MyFinePix Studio, is horrible.  I have installed/uninstalled it several times and it still doesn't work.  In fact, it only worked the very first time I used it, and now it puts up a plethora of error messages every time I insert a memory card or attach my iPod to my computer.  I'm ready to permanently uninstall it.Since I have a few more days in the 30 day return period, I plan on trying a few different types of settings, such as taking pictures of animals available for adoption, before giving up on this camera.  It's a shame because there are several positive aspects about this camera.  The panoramic feature is nice, the body of the camera feels substantial and \"camera-like\" in my hands, and the flash responds fast (no lag between photos).  The battery life seems to be very good (I have spent two weeks on the ones that came with the camera.  I've taken around 500 photos on these batteries).I hope that I can quickly figure out how to eliminate some of the problems I've had with this camera so that I don't have to return it.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice pictures, poor quality with optical zoom video", "Author": "Jeffery", "ReviewID": "R12R7S9LXTSQFZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the camera after reading a lot of good reviews.

WRONG! This is a great camera even at $150 assuming you are coming from a lower resolution point and shoot as I was(Sony DSC-W1 at 5MP and excellent in it's own right). 14MP is amazing for this average joe of a photographer.Today I went to my local arboretum and took some greenhouse flower and outdoor landscape photos in diminishing afternoon light. All handheld and when I viewed them on my PC at home I was extremely pleased with my results. Very crisp photos with great detail and color saturation even in natural light. As expected I could not focus in these light conditions at maximum focal length but that is the limitations of this type of camera that incidentally does not allow you to zoom or focus manually. Most of the 24x zoom range on this camera should be reserved for outdoor conditions. The image stabilization works very well and you can get away with hand holding it if you're just looking for a useable image otherwise bring the tripod along. It does however have a neat function in SP mode called \"Natural\" that will expose one image without flash and one with with one press of the shutter. In most cases I was most happy with the no flash images. The flash is intelligent and does a nice job of matching the amount of flash output to the existing natural light. I really like the fact that you must manually pop up the flash so it will not fire unless you want it too.The user interface is also user friendly if you take some time to familiarize yourself with the user manual which is available on the cd or as a pdf download from Fuji's site. I found this camera's menus much easier to navigate than my Sony DSC-W1's. There are plenty of options for the more demanding user as well as the Auto and Program functions that works surprisingly well for most situations.So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Two reasons. The first one is that you cannot use this camera for any purpose without removing the lens cap. Since they began putting such large displays on these cameras I would really like the ability to review my photos without taking off the lens cap. The second is the LCD monitor. My Sony has spoiled me. When it was introduced it had one of the largest LCD displays available at the time and is fairly clear even in moderately bright light. I got into the habit of checking each photo after taking it. The S4250/4200's LCD is low resolution for it's size as well as being very difficult to see in anything but indoor lighting conditions. I am not comfortable with having to wait to go indoors or viewing on my PC to check my photo's condition, even though my results were surprisingly acceptable.As I said earlier this purchase was a gamble. I was researching superzoom cameras for an upcoming trip to Alaska and the price for this feature set seemed like a great bargain and too good not to investigate. I pulled the trigger knowing that I might be disappointed but if so I could return it and continue my search, which is not something I normally do. That said, I am definitely not disappointed in this camera but I will be returning it for these reasons and purchasing the Fuji HS25EXR, which has a brighter LCD and allows me to turn the camera on without removing the lens cap. The CMOS sensor, 2MP extra, longer zoom and manual zoom/focus doesn't hurt either! Hell,it's only money!NOTE: This review is meant for the more casual and budget conscious photographer and the high rating is meant to reflect that as I feel that is Fuji's target audience.

The batteries and the right side of the camera become very hot only after a half hour. I was iffy about getting a camera without a battery pack cause they never last long but I thought I would be able to take more than 5 pics.

It's an OK camera for what it does.  I would have bought a Canon or Nikon on sale for around the same price (because they takes clearer pictures) but they didn't have a viewfinder.  A viewfinder is a must (for me) when zooming.  The button to switch to viewfinder on the S4200 is out of reach with one hand.  The viewfinder also doesn't have a focus (needed for people who wear glasses).  The camera is a little heavy (because of the batteries) and the grip is a bit too big.  The pics ae a bit grainy (noise) especially if zoomed.  The 'panorama' setting is cool.  Came with alkeline batteries which don't last long (get rechargeable batteries) and didn't come with a memory card.  Focusing sometimes takes awhile. Have to fiddle with the lens cap to get it to stay on and battery compartment is flimsy.  The batteries always fall out when I take the memory card out to upload pics to the computer.  I've had about 4 cheaper point-n-shoot camera with zooms 18x or greater.

We purchased ours on a whim from Wal-Mart in March (the S4250 Wal-Mart variant).  We got it just a few dollars cheaper than the Amazon price ($199) at the time, plus it included coupons for 100 free 4x6 prints at Wal-Mart, so it seemed like a reasonable deal.  I've been able to do a lot of things with this camera that our previous point and shoot cameras could not do.  You can change the fstop and shutter speed to get some great lower light night shots.  I did a time lapse of an incoming thunderstorm one night in August and came up with a pretty good video, you could make out a lot of details and of course see the lightning flashes.  Also, you can buy an adapter tube and put on additional filters and lenses.  The only downside is that if you use a telephoto lens, it doesn't play nice with the autofocus.  Your best bet is to get either a really, really high quality 72 MM or larger telephoto lens, or just invest in a DSLR camera without autofocus if you want to use a telephoto lens. But even so, with some patience you can even work out nice shots with a telephoto lens.  My favorite attachment is a variable neutral density filter with 2-8 stops in tandem with our adapter tube and UV filter.  With these items I can produce some great images in all weather conditions.  The neutral density filter is particularly useful this time of year, when there is snow that can oversaturate an image, or if you want to get a shot with a slower shutter speed on a bright, sunny day.  Altogether we have around $320 dollars invested in this camera, and despite it's limitations being a point and shoot, it produces high-quality results that are comparable to more expensive point and shoots and DSLRs on the market.

The deciding factors for me was the 24X optical zoom, the use of AA batteries and the inclusion of the view finder on top.  I just wish it had come in red like a few others.  Before my camera arrived, I downloaded the owners manual and read all.  It is nice to be able to review details at my computer.  The small basic manual in the box gets you started but to fully enjoy all the functions the downloaded version is a must.  My previous digital is a Kodak easyshare with HD and 5x zoom, that I have been using and enjoying for the past 5 years.  After a trip to Yellowstone/Grand Tetons I realized 5x zoom didn't cut it and that I would look for a new camera.  I will still take the Kodak at times I need to have one to pop in a pocket when taking interior shots of our rental properties but for travel and family pictures the Fuji has everything I want in an upgrade.  I have been taking a number of test shots mainly outdoors in various light and this zoom is like having binoculars!  If I steady my arm I can get zooms with little blur.  I am so happy that it has the view finder as it helps not having to look down esp. in outdoor sunlight.  The overall size and feel is great and basic shooting in Auto is a snap.  I have a lot to learn and try out when it comes to features and the menu.  I was documenting a flood damage at one of our units with the Kodak and in the middle of it the battery went dead.  It has been frustrating as it gives no warning. I know that with the Fuji I can just pop in new AAs and continue. I finished the project the next day with the Fuji and pictures were great in auto even in poor lighting and without the flash.The Kodak has 14mp so this Fuji quality of shots was similar.  Then, I took a picture of my dog and was amazed that I could see individual hairs!I got this with a bundle including perfectly fitting Fuji camera case, 16gb class 10 card, extra rechargable AAs with charger, car charger and misc. cleaning kit.

I did a lot of research online and comparison in stores... all other cameras with the same features were $320 to $600+, and many of those had broken buttons or error messages or something. Weird, I shot only Nikon film SLRs back when and they were the best, period. But Nikon digitals have loose wiggly buttons and feel cheap and plasticy across the board. Just sayin'.24x optical zoom. Fast, too. Though even with dual stabilization, it's almost impossible to get sharp handheld photos at high (9+) zoom.Lightweight yet solid. Control buttons are well-positioned and give you a nice solid click.EVF for tracking moving subjects, composing shots in high ambient light, etc.Aperture priority, if I want shallow depth of field.14mp! Sharp photos with incredible detail.Accepts high capacity SD cards... a 16gb card holds 2352 pics at max resolution.Takes excellent macro and supermacro photos.You often can't tell from the lcd or EVF, but sharp focus.What I Don't Like:TOO MANY OPTIONS!!! It's maybe nice to have them, but you set the ISO or color saturation in one mode, and it doesn't transfer when you shoot in another mode. And who needs all that Facebook stuff and in-camera editing when you're going to download onto a computer anyway?The manual (pdf download) is nearly 150 pages long! Many of the subjects are not well explained (ie: in what on-camera menu can I find it this feature?), and some are not addressed at all (ie: overlaying 3x3 grid to aid in composition and vertical/horizontal alignment)The LCD is REALLY reflective, it's difficult to see with all the glare. And the brightness control is on the third (out of five!) page of the tools menu.EVF is too small, and the eyepiece is HARD. If you are panning or zooming, the EVF view is jerky.Exposure compensation: +1/3 is almost enough, but +2/3 is way too much. WTF?*****COLOR BALANCE skewed toward yellow, especially in outdoor natural light. Blues are fine, greens are excellent, reds are kind of off, orange is gold, pink is too hideous for words... envision red wine and bananas in a blender, you get the idea. Everything looks like I'm taking pictures as the sun is exploding (What would be the  point? Who would be alive to see them?) I tried pretty much every possible combination; the most realistic is with white balance on \"sunny\" and STD color... but still very imperfect.  I could overlook just about everything else, but this one really pisses me off! Gonna spend a lot of time with editing software. Grrrrr...Contrast is a little too sharp. Whites and light colors tend to be washed out and lack detail at +1/3... yet at zero compensation, scenes are too dark overall. WTF??Multi AF mode is a misnomer- it chooses ONE focus zone (NOT multiple) out of many possible. Kind of pointless.. you want to take a photo of 2 horses in a field, and only one is in focus?? Seems to choose the same two on the upper left side no matter what the subject, too.AA batteries. Yeah, alkalines are available anywhere... but you'll need NiMH for any kind of decent battery life. That's an extra expense for the batteries, a spare set, and the charger. A proprietary rechargeable battery would have been smaller and lighter to carry in your pocket, and much MUCH cheaper.Edit: One more thing... it took me literally 5 minutes to figure out the battery configuration the first time... there are stamped + and - battery icons stamped into the plastic, but they are so incredibly shallow and flat black on flat black as to be unreadable even held under a lamp with a magnifying glass! Add to that the two small phillips-head screws that look like plus signs and are next to two battery slots, exactly on center... sheesh! FWIW the two outside batteries go in head first (- exposed).Nitpicking:Textured righthand grip and rubberized lens barrel make it easy to grasp... but it's still a little small for  my hands, and there's nothing to hold onto on the left side. The one I tested in a store didn't have ANY texture on the grip, so I don't know if it's a \"normal\" feature.Center pinch lens cap is hard to grip.Neck strap is MUCH too short for a tall person, with the provided neckstrap at max length the camera sat between my nips, also the camera can (I tried it) come off the slippery nylon straps if pulled.Battery/memory card door is tricky to open, you have to pull it while holding the latch unlocked. And unless you set the camera upside down, batteries are in danger of falling out when the door is open.Slow to save to memory card... with a class 6 card, you still get about 2 seconds of lag time and black screen as it saves the photo.End result? I SO regret buying it. I blew some gift cards on it, so the the expense wasn't too bad, and now it's too late to return. Wish I had waited for a used Panasonic FZ35 (I recommend Panasonic Lumix FZ and TZ series)to show up somewhere.***Edit comments: I've gotten closer with the color problem by custom white balancing in full sun, on the side of light gray stucco house... I would call it cinderblock, or maybe even light pewter. Which makes completely no sense; balancing on a surface that's more blue than yellow ought to INCREASE yellow saturation... I first tried balancing on some light tans and beiges, then the photos were more yellow/orange than ever. Completely backwards! Anyway, resulting yellow-to-red spectrum is much nearer to realistic now. Blues seem a bit over-vivid (this is all in \"standard\" color BTW). Some brighter greens (tree leaves) are good; however muted greens like sage or olive are the correct tone but too dark; that could be from the CONTRAST/exposure problem I described before and am still having. There is no way at all to tone down contrast when shooting.PLUS, the on/off button is starting to stick. I really hate this P.O.S. camera.One more thing I failed to mention: although the image on the LCD or EVF never really looks sharply focused, the photos okay.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "Jamies_mom", "ReviewID": "R1CS6YMBVY5ANO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 2 months now and I'm not too sure I like it.

It has 14 megapixels (it could be better, but oh well) and an amazing, controllable (no tripod necessary) 24x zoom.

I did take photography, and do know the basics. We are on a tight budget, and I wanted something other than a standard point-and-shoot, so I opted for a bridge camera. My first \"bridge\" was a Nikon Coolpix 8600 back in 2001 which ran me $700.00!After much research, I decided on this model. I haven't had it long, so I will be updating this review again soon.Initial take: great size and easy to hold/handle. Fairly easy to maneuver through the menus, so long as you read the FULL manual which you have to download. (These manufacturer's are getting too cheap to even bother putting the full manual in with the product anymore)!Quick shutter time, and ability to catch your shot quickly even though it seems there is a lag.Disappointed in the fact that this camera does extremely poor in low light situations on auto setting. I was taking indoor photos at our local pool which had plenty of natural and flourescent light, but this camera refused to take any shots on auto below 1600 ISO. Therefore, the shots were horribly grainy, dark, and slightly out of focus. Take the camera outside, it is overcast. Again, I use auto setting, and again, plenty of natural light. The camera decides to take the pics at 800 ISO, which for the lighting conditions seemed overly high to me. Again, photos were blurred and grainy. I used the P setting instead, and bumped my max ISO setting to 400. At this time, the photos seem to be FAR better, but there are still some issues with low light situations. Being I am familiar with cameras and their functions, I can probably adjust the shutter/ISO and aperature to my tastes, but of course this takes away from the ease of a \"point and shoot\" where I want to use one.I will be experimenting this week with this camera, and see how well it performs in all situations.

In my experience the line is flawed by easily breakable parts and cameras.  I will digress from the S4200 experience for a moment with my experience with the XP10 which was supposedly shockproof, among other things. I did in fact drop the camera -- about 6 inches total from my hands to the kitchen counter.  This had the effect of killing the pixels on the viewscreen in about a 1 cm diameter right where you need to see to focus.  The pics it took were still good, but the big black circle on the viewfinder made taking pictures a little more challenging.Fast forward to the S4200, which I got despite my prior experience.  My wife and I had the unit for about 3 months before the shutter button (which also acts as the zoom control) snapped off.  The button is cheaply made plastic and held on to the unit with 2 thin plastic rods.This will most likely be my last fuji camera.

I simply read the book and that was all that I needed. I read most of the reviews on this product so I was a bit nervous but here are some things I picked up from READING and putting it into practice1. You don't need a tripod. Once you press the 'shoot' button half way down it focuses the shot so I was able to take a lot of pics on full zoom by following that instruction2. I don't leave the batteries in the camera so I was able to take pics for an entire day (about 75) without replacing the batteries.3. I don't know anything professional related so setting picture quality based on all the technical terms would drive me crazy and have me confused for days so I set the camera on automatic setting selection and that works pretty fine for me. I am guessing if you want to take super professional pics that might work for you but I am also guessing if you are a 'professional' you should have more money to invest into something more hi-tech.With that said, I have to say if you want something to take amateur pics that will look better than the average joe's pics, then this is the camera for you.I you want something to take pics to sell in an art gallery, spend your money and stop whining.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "Michele A.

I needed a camera that would work well in low light and capture action shots.  That is not an easy list of needs to fill without spending hundreds of dollars.  My son plays ice hockey and this camera is perfect for the conditions inside the rink.  Too often my old camera had too much of a delay and I'd miss the shot.  Other cameras don't work well enough without a flash to capture the image.  (Can't use a flash when standing next to the glass.)  This worked well for both being fast enough to get the shot and adapted to the low light situation present in some rinks.  I have also taken great shots of outdoor lacrosse games - so high action but lots of light.  I have gotten many great shots of our pets both lounging and in action as well - inside using the flash.This has turned out to be a fabulous over-all camera.  Lots of setting to serve many needs but not so many that the average user will be overwhelmed.  I haven't used the video part of the camera much but it seems to be okay.My only gripe is that the neck strap fell off after about two weeks of use.  Might be I didn't get it on properly, but now I am strapless when using the camera.  Not a deal breaker and fortunately I was holding the camera when the strap came off so no damage done.I was reluctant to purchase a camera that used standard AA batteries because I had read somewhere that they are inferior but I don't find that to be the case with this camera.  While I like the convenience and savings of the rechargable camera batteries - I also like the convenience of being able to toss regular batteries in the case as my back up.  And if I forget the replacement batteries, it is super easy to drop into a store and pick up a pack.I have used this camera for about three months and gave it five stars because it can't be beat for the price.  I'm sure a more expensive camera could do better but I really can't complain about this one.

I'm not a professional photographer nor do I want to be.  The S4200 has a lot of nice features housed in a great-looking package, and I'm discovering more of them as I go along.  I mainly use my camera for taking cityscapes, statues, family/friends, wildlife at the zoo, and anything else that captures my fancy.  Plus, it saves a lot of time when taking pictures of my own artwork and uploading & editing is a breeze.  This camera beats any scanner I've ever seen or used.  What I love most is that the S4200 isn't complicated and it meets my wants, needs, desires, and budget.  Fujifilm makes great products at reasonable, down-to earth prices & the S4200 is yet another example of this.When I do decide to upgrade, I'm definitely keeping it within the Fujifilm family.  Most likely, it will either be an S1000 or the HS50 EXR. Even when this happens, I'm still hanging on to my S4200 as my \"go-to\" camera when I want to travel light.I have two suggestions for anyone wishing to purchase this camera:  Go ahead and spring for the Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries because they'll last a lot longer than any other AAs (and you'll buy a lot fewer, too) and don't bother registering with the My FinePix website because it's far more trouble than it's worth.

It's nice and heavy and the hand grip is comfortable.My only issues are the shutter speed (a bit slow, the sony didn't have that problem), night shots (go for an Olympus SP-620UZ for amazing night shots), and auto-focus while in macro (which I'm sure requires more practice time with the camera).", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still Testing..

I have a lot of time on my hands fortunately.The camera takes really awesome macro photos. No kidding! My brother is a professional photographer and I showed him the photos and he said \"for a novice you take good photos\" I was tempted to take credit for it but NAW I just showed him the camera. lol.. It works great for what I bought it for. It also takes pretty good photos in the right settings. The zoom is almost unbelievable for a camera this price range. Just make sure you are not zooming on something thats close or it will not focus. Yup I tried... The flash works too contrary to the reviews I read.That said. The camera does feel a little flimsy until you insert the four batteries it uses and them BAM it feels a lot better. It is easy to use if you know how to read so I recommend READ the manual.I couldn't find any reviews regarding the memory and I tried it with 500mb (4 speed i think) and 16gb (10 speed) and both worked awesome. Only thing I noticed was the video allowance went up from 2 mins with 500mb to 9mins and a few seconds with the 16gb therefore size of the card matters not so with another GE \"dslr\" i bought and returned.It didnt come with the lens strap and I contacted customer service and they resolved that issue without any hassles at all.

But what can you expect for a cheaper camera? I am familiar with digital cameras and was able to take this one out of the box, put in the batteries and my SDHD card and started shooting right away. This camera in my opinion does so much better in a (light condition). The subject is not as clear and seems grainey in darker rooms (window rooms). After I found that out I went and took some pictures of the horses. I LOVE action pictures and took one of the horses eating out of the round bale and you could see every particle of hay flying in the air!!.. which was amazing to me at a 24X zoom. I have had trouble zooming toward objects behind another object (as in horses behind fences), the camera I had always targeted on the object in front and I hated that... This one in auto will target what you want which is very helpful!! This camera to me is def. a $200+ camera. The HD video is pretty sweet as well. Very clear BUT don't like that you can't zoom while in video recording mode, as some digital cameras will do. I will say I haven't really shopped around and bought this one pretty quickly when I seen the specs and video review...

So far so good, it's smaller, much lighter and much much easier on the batteries.  My biggest gripe about the S7000 was battery life.

The battery icon still shows plenty of juice left.I'm still learning the features and settings but it offers a lot of options.

And the date stamp would not set properly.In addition to it not working, here is my take on this camera if it had worked properly.  I probably would have returned it anyway.  It feels cheap (it feels like one of those old film cameras that are lightweight and plastic...and I understand they are trying to make it lightweight and all, but really?) and is poorly designed.  The compartment that you put your memory card in is also where the batteries are housed.  So every time you open the compartment to put in or take out the memory card, the batteries fall out.  And, it is not a one handed operation; the compartment is not easy to open; you have to use your fingernail to open it which results in a broken nail.  I am sure the engineers that designed this camera are not photographers; and maybe have never used a camera before.  It is as if they tried to save space by putting the memory card with the batteries, and then said \"oh, poo! since the door is going to be opened a lot for the memory card, we should make the latch extra sturdy there!\" ... which results in it being very difficult to open.  Now, this might be fine for someone who puts a card in, goes on vacation, and takes hundreds of photos before taking out the card.  But, if you are like me and need to take only a few or several at a time and take out the card to view it in Photoshop, you are going to be highly frustrated.Also, I think the problem with the time/date stamp may be because whenever you take out the card, and the batteries fall out, the camera prompts you to put in the date again when you turn the camera on...every time...which is annoying....but it would not let me put in the month and date, just the year, and then the month and day showed 0.The problem I had with the zoom, was it would not move at all when I was trying to focus for a shot...so I would look at the camera and try to figure out if I was on the right button (which I knew I was) and then it would just randomly start zooming.  And then get stuck there, and not \"un\" zoom.  And then I would MISS the shot :/I sent it back and got a Canon EOS Rebel T3I.  Which is more expensive....but it works....and will work for a long time which will avoid having to spend more money in the very near future for a new camera.  Which definitely was defeating the purpose of trying to find a moderately priced great camera....which this is NOT a great camera...IF it worked it might have been a good camera at best.The problem with color...yes I read the other wonderful review about color balance and inside colors looking yellow, etc...and yes it does....and it looks very grainy....I get better photos on my old IPAD!  Seriously!  You can adjust the color balance, but it is just so off the begin with!  I understand photography a little and thought I could handle it, but it is a pain!  On the plus side, if you are only going to take photos outside they are pretty good...unless you are trying to zoom...and the zoom does not work...like mine.So, if you are looking for something \"up\" a level from a point and shoot, kinda like a really good camera but with training wheels, if you want to try this one, go ahead, Amazon has a great return policy...but in my opinion....Save your money.  Save up for something a little bit better that has had good reviews for a long time.For the good part of this review.  Amazon was incredibly wonderful with the return.  I went to my account, clicked on return, told them why (without all of this detail, just the zoom was not working and the date stamp was not working), they emailed me a return slip to put in the box, and scheduled UPS to come to my door to pick it up.

This camera transitions effortlessly from the small, 'party-sized,' point&shoot; digital cameras that we'd outgrew.. towards a more serious, 'photography-capable' camera.  It is a blend of both worlds--not overwhelmingly complex (via its very clear, efficient layout/organization), but there are definitely a multitude of features, settings, & fine-tunings if you so choose to explore & learn them towards greater photography skills.  It definitely delivers stellar photos, no matter the freewheelin' features, to suit any level of amateur photography.  Very easy to use, yet packs a lot of extra features/settings if you want to learn more & progress in your photography skills.  Huge built-in zoom and pop-up flash are definitely a welcomed compromise from the hardcore professional DSLR camera with different lens, accessories, etc. A definite step-up in photography-technology, without the cost or headaches of a more expensive/complex DSLR camera.  All in all, you can't deny the professional quality of photos that this camera delivers, right out of the box!

I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants quality photo's. One of the things I would suggest is that you watch the video that one of the other raters compiled. I'm sorry that I don't remember his name but I am sure you can find it. He did an excellent job explaining the way the camera worked and I was able to just take the camera out and start shooting.

The video camera is easy to use as well. We filmed our daughter up on a stage at her school spelling bee and the video is clear and sharp. The only drawback was that the photos we took from far away did not turn out very well. They were fuzzy and it was difficult to make out our daughter's face.

Having a limited budget limited my choices severely, but was told that Fujifilm makes a good camera. The reviews were good for this particular model, so i purchased it. So far so good. I haven't learned all this camera will do yet (have had it less than a month). There are 2 cons that I have found so far. The first is it doesn't come with a rechargeable battery. Even though the 4 AA batteries last a fairly long time (long enough for several hundred photos), I probably will get weary of having to constantly buy batteries for it. Looking into rechargeable ones and hope that takes care of the problem. The 2nd con is the battery well is often hard to close. For some reason I have to try over and over until it finally clicks. I don't know if it's this particular camera that has the problem, or if they're all like that. It is not easy to close. Other that these two issues, I have had no problems (although I wish it had come with a cloth to clean the lens) and the camera takes great photos.

I got this camera on Saturday as an early Christmas present from my roommate. I had been raving about wanting a Nikon, but since I'm new at this I thought a not so expensive starter camera would be just fine. As I get better I hope to upgrade to a nikon dslr.  To start it feels really good in your hands. Not cheap, but not too heavy. Easy to turn on and fast which is great for suddenly deciding to take a picture. It is not difficult to figure out how to use the wide variety of controls and photo variations. It comes with a strap and lens cap. The strap isn't the best, but it does its job. I carried it around with me on Saturday taking test shots of random things, the pictures came out really well considering it was raining. The person I'm dating right now is really into photography so with their help I will take some photos, post them, and add to this review as the week goes on.

This is the first one I've purchased with zoom and all thee extra stuff you can do (if you can figure it out) I like to take candid photos, mostly of people and animals so it helps to have a camera that you can point and shoot. This one is not like that at all. Maybe I'm just too stupid to have a camera with all these extra features,like video and zoom. But besides that after one charging the camera stopped working. Made sure the battery was charged but nothing would work. I sent it back to Fuji priority mail and it took them a very long time to send an email saying it was received and it would be repaired or replaced, I think when they get around to it. I sent it back on 8-6 and have no idea when I'll get it back.

It has an amazing zoom that will knock your socks off. But there's also some not so amazing things about it. For one, it requires you to fully power up the camera, including removing the lens cap, when you hook it up to your computer to transfer files. So instead of an actual USB mode, which EVERY camera I've previously owned has had, this one requires you to fully power it up, remove the lens cap, potentially get it dirty while the display runs at full bright white. Annoying as heck and ultimately is potentially damaging. The other thing is the macro mode. Do NOT buy this camera if taking close-ups is a major thing for you. It just really sucks at that. The auto-focus is so completely non-functional in macro mode that the mode might as well not exist.NOW, having said all that, if you want a camera with a really good zoom that takes good pictures of people and the countryside, this does that very well.

Still I had no luck, In a final test I set the camera on the floor, laid down, and tried to take a distance shot. It came out the same blurred, grainy, picture as what I'd been getting all afternoon. Back to Amazon it went.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Serious photographer on a budget --- Dissappointed", "Author": "Richard Sonnenfeld", "ReviewID": "R33YBF89AM3Z8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am not a professional photographer, but I understand photography, and I regularly trade off shutter-speed, F-stop and CCD \"speed\" to get the shot I want.  Think of this camera as a point-and-shoot with better optics. It does have optical zoom, which is a good thing, but the CCD is clearly pretty small (not sure how small, but surely nothing close to a 35 mm frame).  Of course, the cameras that DO have large CCDs are $1000 or more.  So my disappointment is that this LOOKS like a real camera, but it isn't.Anyone who has studied the Megapixel wars knows that it's an invalid spec.  This camera may have 14 Mpixels, but I'd say the image quality is worse than the last Canon camera I had (which sadly broke) that had only 6 Mpixels.  It's really overall a bad thing.  A camera with 14 MPixels takes giant images (file size is giant) but the quality is not there.  So essentially you are wasting hard-drive space or clogging up your e-mail with files that are probably 5 times larger than they should be becauseof the empty magnification.  This camera is loadedwith features to try to get the best shot if you don't know anything about photography, but if you DO know something,it's frustrating.  I tried to use aperture priority mode, which should allow you to set the aperture and have the camerachoose the shutter speed to get the shot.  This is useful when you want to control depth of field.  On this camera, aperturepriority only allows F3.5 (wide open) and F8.  I was disappointed that you could not have anything in between.  I think it'sbecause it's really not for serious photographers.

I usually buy Canon Cameras but the price was very good on the Fuji Camera. I currently order a small Fuji and it has always worked well.I received the camera and got it all set up, took a couple pictures to check out the zoom and to see how it looks. I then put it back in the bag because I bought this camera for vacations and other important pictures. I got it out about a week later to read and understand more about this camera and the batteries were dead?? I replaced batteries and reset up the date and time, etc. Went thru the camera and the manual. Put it away. Was getting ready for vacation so I got the camera out to make sure it was ready and again the batteries were dead. I called Fujifilm and they didn't know what was wrong with the camera and told me to send it in. I took it on vacation first and then sent it in to be fixed. I bought this camera in July 2012 and sent it in September 2012. Now I get a note saying the parts are not under warranty??? Most all products have a year long warranty.

I taken several hundred shots, may be more.  Their's a lot of thing to figure out!  The flash doesn't work all the time, especially when you what it too, you'll have to wait or just take another picture with no flash, and then take one when it decides to flash.  The camera on my Iphone takes some better pictures in many cases.  This Fuji Camera take some pretty good ones as well, some come out even better then my Iphone.  I guess I'd have to say, after writing this review, and thinking about it! that this  Fuji Camera isn't really worth bothering with, at least for me.  The reason I say this is, it's so much easier to point an shoot my Iphone, it's always in my hand anyway.  The picture usually come out just as good, if not better then this Fuji Camera.  I bought this Fuji Camera to take better pictures then what I already have, but it's beginning to sink in my head, that maybe it's just to much effort.  I can't stick it in my pocket, and I have to be really careful with, this Fuji Camera, and it not all that easy to hold.
