{"Reviews": [{"Title": "All Convenience, Terrible Quality", "Author": "Avalanche Lily", "ReviewID": "R6YLYYROO6JAU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I will go as far to say that I hate this camera. Almost with a passion. The flash is terrible. It flashes 3 three times before taking a picture and usually leaves you with washed out, bluish subjects with half-closed eyes.The only way to get decent shots with this camera is to not use the flash or take pictures outside in bright light.The delay is frustrating. When you hit the button to take the picture there is about a 2 second delay- long enough to miss those wonderful candid moments (especially ones you may have with a toddler who moves quickly). Sometimes it won't even take a picture.I do like the convenience of emailing my pictures and printing at home (but I haven't used the printer dock it came with). But this is hardly enough to balance the terrible low-quality of pictures. If all you're concerned about is getting snapshots to email to friends and family, this may work for you. But if you are someone looking to take quality pictures, this is a bad choice.What can I say? It was a gift.", "Date": "October 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Charlotte Fiandaca", "ReviewID": "R3AC9PQY3BBFMR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It  was very much as I had hoped.

When it was stolen I wanted to replace it so I ordered it on line .It is small and easy to carry and I can download the pictures onto my computer or I can pick my favorites and print them on the printer-charger that it came with. I can also take out the chip and take it to print the pictures or put them on a dvd.  I am not an average photographer I don't take many pictures and even I can take a picture with me Easy Share.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "4.0 MP CCD & image resolution / JPEG/EXIF v 2.22 still format / f/4.6 lens / Advanced digital zoom-5x continuous with LCD preview\nOn camera share button / Optical real image viewfinder / 1.5 inch LCD color display\n16 MB internal memory / xD Picture Card expansion slot (card not included) / Tripod mount", "Name": "Kodak EasyShare CD43 4MP 5x Digital Zoom Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EYB7J130L.jpg", "ProductID": "B000HCZ7V8"}}
