{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great Kodak camera!", "Author": "Ryanst", "ReviewID": "R3O9Y3H5RLXSMS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was a Kodak DX6440, which was a fantastic camera back in it's day (2003). After the Kodak, I had a Fuji J20, which I was very unhappy with; very noticeable vignetting (dark corners) with all of the pictures. I decided to go back to Kodak and so I purchased the M530. Very happy with it! The feel of it, the image quality, user interface is all very very good.Pictures are incredibly crisp, clear and accurate for a sub $100 camera. The smart capture mode works very well too and is reliable.There are a few minor annoyances though. One, the camera doesn't remember which mode to start up in. It automatically defaults to smart capture every time the camera is turned on. This is somewhat irritating since you aren't likely leave the camera on for a long time between shots, and if you want to take pictures with more manual control, you will need to select the mode you want every time the camera is started up. Luckily, the user interface is pretty well designed though where you don't need to hit a dozen buttons to do what you want to do.Two, the auto white balance can be somewhat unreliable. I find that colors either turn out too cool (blueish tint) or too warm (redish tint), although some shots turn out perfectly. The problem seems to be exacerbated when taking pictures of landscapes. The angle of the sun also affects the white balance selection. Turn towards the sun and you may get different colors than you get turning away from the sun. I would say the auto mode gets it right about 70% of the time.Lastly, because this camera uses a very inexpensive lens, there is some minor light falloff present in some of the pictures. I find that it is only noticable when the sky takes up a large part of the scene in the picture. You'll notice a very gradual darkening as you move towards the two upper corners. The problem is minor though, and for most people it shouldn't be a problem. I, however, find it annoying.Overall though, this camera is a fantastic buy. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a cheap, yet decent quality point and shoot.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Point and Shoot", "Author": "C. McCay", "ReviewID": "R2CAVB8MQDJYGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera. It is compact, comes in cute colors, has a vivid screen and takes crisp, clear pictures. I'm no professional, but for an on the go college student this has surely passed the test. It outshines my old camera (a samsung) and I have yet to get a blurry picture, even when taking shots of mountains while driving at 60 mph. The new share function on the new Kodak line is awesome as well! One small thing I also ended up liking alot was the small grip area (the greyish black part on the side); makes the already light camera super easy to hold. Amazing fast face recognition too. Overall, two thumbs up if you're looking for an easy to use camera that takes awesome pictures!", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easyshare M530", "Author": "D.

I've had cameras with batteries and they can never take more than a few photos.  I finally decided to get a camera with built-in battery.  I'm so glad that I did!  The picture quality is good.

A small sampling of my frustrations: poor picture quality generally (especially in low light.. and in any light I've generally gotten much better photos out of other cameras with similarly cheap optics and much lower megapixels), awkward menus (for example just deleting one bad photo is awkward enough that I got in a habit which soon led me to, with one extra accidental click, perhaps irretrievably wiping the entire SD card... despite supposed \"protect\" features which themselves are unusually problematic to use and perhaps just outright buggy...), insistence on downloading and installing Kodak's annoyingly cutesy and proprietary software when I just want a quick charge or card read (which was especially problematic when traveling between PCs, sometimes with poor internet connections).I really wish I had paid a few bucks more for a non-Kodak camera with better picture taking, more optical zoom, and less problematic software.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "would be good if it didn't eat batteries", "Author": "katherine", "ReviewID": "RRSKHS2W0ORI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this about a year.

It is extremely easy to use. There are 4 buttons on the side of the screen for various things so that you don't have to go through a crazy menu to get to what you need. The buttons on the top also bring up nice neat menus in which you can change the scene setting and picture quality very easily. It plays back sound on video I only tried it once and I was alone it didn't sound that great but there really wasn't much to hear so hopefully its better than what I think, which is still better than the no sound I got from my old easyshare. The lens isn't as loud when it comes on or goes off as my old one either. Its a cute color and a great size. It is a small camera and not heavy so dropping it would probably do some type of damage to the body it does have a lanyard included so i would suggest you use it to prevent accidents. When you are taking a picture and looking through the lcd you will notice that it is a bit fuzzy but as soon as you snap the pic it will be clear and sharp for review and uploading as well. The share feature from the software is very easy to use. If you are using facebook you will have the option to create a new album or add to an existing one. I was concerned about having to charge it up rather than use regular batteries because I am used to batteries and they are easy to replace, but so far no problems the battery seems to hold the charge for a while but I have only had this for about a week. Anyway it takes great pictures, i have gotten excellent snow pics and pics of my betta with this.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "great gift", "Author": "Nana Kandy", "ReviewID": "R1A1EOKEM6WJHR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my grandson.

And most importantly, it had a rechargeable battery.  About a month after we got married, the lid to the battery compartment broke. The camera was in the case, in my purse and when I took it out the lid was popped open and broken. Fine. We held it down with duct tape.About 6 months after that, the camera unexpectedly dies while I am in the middle of taking a picture at a party. I open up the battery case and the little tab that holds the battery down to complete the charge has broken. Fine. I put a piece of paper in there to hold tension.Two months after that, the camera is in my purse in the car and a fountain drink spills. The camera gets wet (not soaked by any means, and not even all over wet) and it never turned on again. Now, spilling Coke on a camera is not my intended use, and sucks no matter what, but that still doesn't explain why it was made from the cheapest plastic known to man.As far as pictures, they're fine. Although there's some file glitch where a picture will save and then later tell you it's an \"unrecognizable file format\" and then that picture is just GONE. It is also way easy to \"delete all\" and there is no undelete. This is especially true in bright sunlight when the screen is basically unreadable.It won't hold your settings when you turn it off, so if you are taking several pictures in low light, be prepared to leave the camera on or reset your setting every time.The software is cool. The smart capture works reasonably well, although the camera freezes up, a lot.I would not buy again. Looking at getting a Nikon now. But it was fun while it lasted.

I adore this little camera. It takes wonderful pictures.  I'm still getting familiar with switching quickly back and forth from video to camera mode but the only other critique I have is that whenever I turn it on, and sometimes while I am recording video footage the camera tends to make a small clicking noise. I don't know if it's supposed to do that or what but other than that there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it.
