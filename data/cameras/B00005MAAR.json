The camera is light and tiny but still very comfortable to hold with the built in grip on the side of the camera (unlike Canon's Elph cameras).  The 3x zoom range on the lens is unheard of in a camera this small!What sets the camera apart is Nikon's exposure metering system and the scene modes.  It uses Nikon's renowned sophisticated metering system to get the perfect exposure for nearly every shot.  In addition, it has seven scene modes for common situations where the metering may be fooled (backlight, landscape, beach/snow, sunset, portrait, party/indoor, and night portraits).  This is great for the novice that doesn't want to mess around with complicated manual exposure adjustments.The 2-megapixel CCD is plenty for getting great 8x10 prints.  You'll want to purchase a larger compactflash card because the included 8 MB card will definitely be too small to take more than 15 photos at the highest quality and resolution.It comes with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and battery charger which many other digital cameras in this price range leave out.Compared to the Canon cameras I have used, the colors are much more natural, especially for skin tones.  The Nikons seem to go for the more natural colors as opposed to many cameras that go for more saturated and punchy colorsIf you're looking for a camera with a ton of manual features (saturation control, aperture and shutter priority, full manual control, etc.) then you need to step up to the Coolpix 995, which costs twice as much.I would definitely recommend the camera to the user that is looking for a great, easy-to-use, point and shoot digital camera  that takes awesome photos for printing up to 8x10 photos or just digital photos to share.", "Date": "July 30, 2001"}, {"Title": "Nikon's Answer to Canon's Digital Elph.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R37GX5NAHN6IKE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got into digital cameras through the Coolpix 990 (and recently upgraded to the 995).  I love the power and flexibility of those top-of-the-line Coolpix cameras, but they weren't portable enough to make the cut for parties, light travel, and similar situations.  From the start, I was evaluating this as a second camera: I have the 3-megapixel 995 for high-quality \"composed\" shots, and wanted a less expensive, \"fun\" camera for casual, everyday use.  I was about to buy the Canon S110, but decided to wait for Nikon's 775 release, and I'm glad I did.As a 995 user, I can use the same batteries and NikonView software with both cameras (unfortunately, the USB cable is slightly different to prevent people from trying the MC-EU1 remote cord on the 775).  This fall, Nikon is even releasing the UR-E3 converter that will allow use of the 950/990/995's Wide-Angle and 2x Tele lenses!Compatability aside, the 775 is a winner in it's own right.  I really appreciate the 3x optical zoom (vs. 2x in the Canon S110), and the scene modes allow even greater refining of the quite-capable \"auto\" setting.  You can get creative without delving into the world of manual settings -- great for first-time users, yet still offering something new and useful to the experienced digital photographer.  As you would expect, Nikon delivers on its reputation for high-quality optics and great pictures, even from its 2-megapixels.  The \"macro\" close-ups are unbelievable (the Canon doesn't even come close).  Think mini-950.The only area where the Canon beats the 775 is size -- the Nikon is a good deal thicker front-to-back (I could put the Elph in a shirt pocket, but the 775 just won't fit).  I figure it's a small price to pay for a 3x zoom.  I would have given the 775 \"Five Stars,\" but knocked one off for the construction.  The casing is plastic and, despite its high quality, makes the camera feel like it's \"cheap\" (compared to the aluminum S110, although the 775 is much lighter).  Even if it feels inexpensive, the proof is in the pictures.  The performance has been flawless; we'll see if durability is an issue over time, but I've got no basis for concern.For point-and-shoot convenience and portability, with the quality one would expect from Nikon, the 775 is a most worthy addition to the Coolpix line.", "Date": "August 1, 2001"}, {"Title": "Convenient, good price though some image quality issues", "Author": "Kimo C.

I finally found a camera with all the features (recharger included, >2 megapixels, smaller size, compact flash). After using it for a week, I was very pleased with it. The size makes it very convenient to carry around. It is very easy to use. The one-touch upload is a neat feature. Pictures on first impression are quite good.However, as I play with the photos that it takes a little more, I do notice some image quality issues that I didn't notice originally. First, many pictures have a slightly greenish hue to them (more common in lower light situations), though this is not really a big problem. I find that using an editing software and backing off on the green slightly corrects the colors. The other image quality issue that I note is a little more bothersome. On close inspection of the images, many areas have slight \"noise\" in them consisting of reddish and greenish bands and spots. When zoomed out, they blend fine without any noticeable color problems. However, if you increase the color saturation in image editing software, they become very obvious. I found this to be a problem when getting prints made at Kits camera as the digital media photo printer that they use automatically increases saturation on the images before printing, which causes noticeable red and green artifacts/noise in the pictures.Despite the image quality issues above, the price/size/convenience can't be beat.", "Date": "September 19, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great compromise n evolving digital camera market.", "Author": "R.

There were important to me because (1) my first camera Kodak DC 290 shot very good pictures for my needs at that pixel range (2) I wanted something smaller (3) optical zoom because I can do digital zoom back on the computer so who needs the camera to do it (4) compact flash because its faster and cheaper, and Sony didn't learn from betamax and created another format error, memory sticks (5) I don't like it when a company sticks the consumer 80 to 100 bucks for 'special' batteries for a camera (see Cannon Elph).  This narrowed the list down to just a few cameras.  This one just felt the best in my hand.  Takes great shots, has a self closing lens cap (a nice bonus).  A great everyday camera.

I am an avid photo taker mostly for scrapbooking purposes.  The NC775 appeared to have the best reviews as well as the best features for the money for a first time user.  Encountered a major problem, though, in transferring the pictures from the camera to the computer.  The software has a fatal flaw if loaded onto a computer that also has the CD burner software \"Adeptec Easy CD Creator.\"  After 10 hours of wrestling with the software and camera, I called the 1-800 number; and a very nice gentleman worked with me for about 10 minutes before analyzing what was happening.  He asked me if I had a CD burner; and to my answer of yes, he asked if I used the software Easy CD Creator.  When I said yes to that, he told me about the conflict.  It turns out that even if I removed the Easy CD Creator software there would still be residual files left over that would crash the program.  The Nikon engineers are working on fixing it and they would send me an e-mail notice when there was a fix.  In the meantime he said I might think about getting a \"Memory Card Reader\"; but although that would be a stopgap solution, I don't want to spend this kind of money for a camera that has one fatal flaw.  I don't know what other problems might crop up after the time period expired for getting a refund.  He also suggested that the Nikon Coolpix 880 could be a good match for me.  I'll have to research that.  It seems, also, that the NC775 is the only camera in the Nikon line that has this particular software incompatibility problem.  This major problem should be in a warning to buyers--especially first time buyers of a digital.  The camera is promoted as being an ideal fit for these novice users.  If I had mail-ordered it over the Internet instead of going to a local retailer, I would have had twice the frustration of returning it.  Because the service technician was so nice and straight forward with me, I am very inclined to go with Nikon again since I know that they won't give me the runaround like so many service technicians do (and we have all had that kind of experience).  When I called the 1-800 number I was connected to a technician within a minute of  the first ring.  That impressed me even more.I gave it 3 stars because regardless of the software problems, I was impressed with the camera features.  If all had gone well, I might have been a 5-star customer.

However, in a pinch, you can walk into pretty much any drugstore or camera store and purchase a 2CR5 battery that will also run the camera (that's one positive this camera has over the comparable Canon).c.

I shot about 70 pics just playing around with it a couple of hours last night.  It is very capable, and the images are very sharp.  Although you can't set aperture and shutter speeds manually, there are plenty of ways to control your images through custom white balance, flash, and exposure compensation features.  The manual is also very well written and easy to understand.  There are two reasons why I don't give it 5 stars: 1)Custom settings are not saved if you turn the camera off.  Once you switch it back on, everything is set back to default settings, and many of these custom settings are only accessible through the menus (although they are very easy to navigate).  2)You cannot mannually set white balance, flash, or exposure compnesation if you are in one of the scene modes.  You can accomplish what you want in auto mode where you can get to these settings, but it would be quicker to dial in a scene mode then be able to change just one setting (i.e. flash).  All in all, though, this in an excellent buy for a family point-n-shoot digital camera.  One thing, you had better buy a bigger memory card - the 8mb card that is included just won't do it if you're shooting at the highest resolution.  I suggest 96mb or higher.

It just fit very nicely in your hand. Very good job by Nikon here..The quality of the pictures for 2 m.pixel cameras is excellent and when printed in 4x6 and 5x7 size prints it looks like real fotos.

Excellent control of white balance in auto mode.

What I mostly love about this camera is the fact that it is so easy to use, you just point and shoot and the camera does all the work for you.  Then you just connect it to your computer and you can instantly see all the pictures on the screen.

If one takes pictures as fast as you can by repeatedly pressing the shutter button, the files writen to disk become corrupted when one transfers them to a PC using a Compact Flash to USB converter (Norton Disk Doctor helps to recover them).  If one turns on flash, then the flash slows down the picture taking to eliminate this problem.  If flash is off, one must makes sure the flashing green light (indicating it is writing a picture to compact flash), stops flashing before depressing the shutter button again.* Auto Focus.  The auto focus does not always focus on the correct object, especially when the background distance is different from the subject distance, even w/ the subject clearly in the middle of the frame.  Many auto-focus cameras have this problem.  It think it would be helpful if the software took a small piece in the middle of the frame and expanded it 4x (to check focus) when you depress the shutter half way.* No click. There is no audible noise after taking a picture; therefore, you don't know when and if it took, unless you look for the flashing green light.* I found the the Nikon software to be buggy on Macintosh.  Subsequently, I bought a USB to compact flash converter, attached it to a Windows computer, and used this to move pictures to the windows computer.  Then, I installed ACDSee software on the Windows box, and am very happy w/ this setup.Other than these issues, this camera is terrific.

I was absolutely RAVING.  Thousands of pictures and some 5 months later I rereview the camera as I promised way back.  This camera is a great camera for getting your foot in the door of photography.  It has some great features that other cameras in its class don't have and gets you craving for more.Nikon - on the plus side.1.)  Really good picture, my opinion is that the picture is the best in its class.  For close ups in well lit areas its absolutely amazing.2.)  Price, I'm not really sure whats in its class since its really relatively cheap.3.) For the price it has a lot of well implemented features.  These features come in handy when months down the line you suddenly feel like you want to be a power user.  For example increasing exposure and playing with the white balance creates some really natural looking colors in low light.Down side1.)  The firmware seems to have some bugs.  Settings don't seem to persist through battery charges which is really annoying.  It used to work2.) AUTOFOCUS WHEN THE LCD IS OFF DOESN'T WORK.  God I hope someone at nikon is working on these two bugs.3.) Compared to other cameras with similar specs it is just a little bit on the slow side.4.) Need an autofocus light for use at night!  Canon has it why don't you.Conclusion:  Even with all my complaints I still maintain that this is a great camera.  The price is incredible.  Depending on what your looking for in a camera the nikon might not be for you however.  If you are looking to just point and click and aren't too worried about the artistic value of your picture maybe look into the canon s110.  Its smaller, doesn't have bugs, and built sturdier.  If you have a bit of the artist in you and don't mind a little hassle at times, go for the nikon.

I was off to the races.THE GOOD:It's small and light, and can fit in your pocket.  It's bigger than an Elph, but still quite manageable.  The first day I used it, I had it in my pocket while touring the Napa Valley in CA.  The buttons are easy to use and figure out (I've seen some BAD UI on a Sony Camera), and the industrial design is elegant and sleek.The Coolpix has a bunch of photo modes, but honestly I haven't been able to see much difference between some of them.  Still, the Sunset mode has taken some spectacular shots for me, and I've experimented with Portrait and backlight modes as well, with good results.For me, the meat and potatoes here is the ability to take macro-focused shots.  Being a designer means I like to have shots of textures, which means getting in close.  The macro mode is superb, and I have used it to great effect to get interesting textures from rusty metal, concrete, paper towels and bark.  It's also great for getting closeup shots of things like flowers and other plants.  I've even got good shots of my dog's muzzle.The picture review mode is helpful as well, particularly the thumbnail mode.  You can sort through your photos quickly and delete the bad ones (this is one of the main reasons we get digital cameras in the first place, right?), and mark them for auto-transfer.  You can also zoom in on them if you want, though I've not seen the usefulness of that particular function yet.The default memory card is 8 MB, which some people find to be small, but I find to be perfect.  One of the first things I did was to switch the picture quality to 640 x 480, 72 ppi.  I just don't take photos for print purposes, and i can take about 160 photos at low quality.  Users who want to take hi-res shots should probably get a 128 MB card to allow for good storage of fine-quality shots.The rechargeable battery also has decent life, allowing me to take almost all of those 160 before showing a low battery warning.  Recharging takes a couple hours, though, so make sure to charge up before you head out to Disneyland for a long day of photography.THE BAD:Not much.  My biggest complaint was that the Nikonview software appeared buggy, although apparently the trouble I was having was easily corrected by re-seating the memory card and re-connecting to the computer via USB cable.  The transfer process is very straightforward, just plug the USB cable into the camera and hit the \"Transfer\" button.I've taken about 300 photos (and those are the ones that I've kept) since getting this camera on the 10th of July, and will probably take thousands more.  It's my favorite toy.  I've been a web designer (hush, all you UF readers out there!) for going on seven years now, and in all that time, have never owned a digital camera.

It has something to do with the plastic binding around the lens.  I'm really upset after reading the reviews on this camera because this problem seems to be fairly common.  Most of the reviews with the same problem have stated that Nikon is not helpful in honoring the warranty or fixing the camera for a reasonable price.  I will give it a try and send the camera to them. If they won't fix for a reasonable price I will never by another Nikon.  I just don't think a camera should be this easy to break.

I can't tell you how many times I've had the perfect shot lined up, only to go and take the picture and have the camera delay for several painfully long seconds while it does whatever it does (focus?) before the flash goes off. Needless to say, this isn't acceptable when trying to take candid photos of your child or people in general. If it is the auto focus, then it has to be the slowest in its category. I watch with envy as friends use their digital cameras without impugnity, popping off one shot after another without having to wait for their cameras to ready up. There are other problems as well. Like when you're lining up your shot and--whoops!--the picture screen blackens. You have to press the picture button to bring it back up. Again, you missed the shot.

The 7 \"scene modes\" do a good job for automatically setting aperture and exposure settings. However, those willing to be experiment will be rewarded with a pleasant surprises. What's really interesting with the scene modes is that they have uses beyond the names of the situations that they target. Try Sunset during the day, for example, for a more Golden Hour look. Try Beach/Snow on a back-lit subject for a different, moodier sort of lighting. You can really experiment with this little Nikon.The colors are wonderfully accurate, even with the auto setting. There is a manual white balance in addition to the 5 \"preset white balance settings.\" Just place a white piece of object in front of the camera, and it will automatically adjust the color balance of the shot. This is really great when you have multiple sources of lights and/or if you know you have sufficient light and don't want to use the flash. Contrary to what another reviewer has said in here that may be misleading, I haven't yuet found a single instance where there are red/blue/breen banding on pictures taken with sufficient light. He is probably talking about the amount of noise in the picture when a scene is taken without sufficient lighting (very low light conditions). I still have to experience the \"sunspots\" he was referring to when taking photos with the speedlight (Nikon's word for flash).Some of the photos do not come as sharp as I'd like them to be (at least on screen), but when I printed them out on a 6-color Epson photo printer, they look amazingly like normal 35-mm prints. This camera (like those from Sony, Epson, Casio, etc.) saves additional info in its JPEG files called \"Print Image Matching (PIM)\" that when printed on PIM-enabled photo printers, the colors are richer and hues truer to what you actually saw when you took the photo.All the above plus the 3x-zoom and the ultra-compact and go anywhere light weight makes this camera a smart buy.

I used auto mode on all four and they all had shown slight different contrast and color balance.  They were all unique to one another but not bad at all.  I can tell all the digital camera shoppers out there \"digital cameras in general nowadays shares similar technologies and they are all not bad at all taking photos\"  Probably you should look for the one that looks the best on you or what kind of special features they have.Yes I also looked at all the CNET reviews and for the average users would not be able to tell much a difference.  ...  I am not saying CNET is not a reliable source.  However, I just CANNOT believe all of their reviews.  Most of times I prefer customer's review sometimes.My review might contradict a lot of CNET reviews.First Digital camera I bought was Toshiba PDR-M4 came with all I need(adapter and rechargable Lithium Ion battery is big plus)  and the best LCD I've ever seen.  love their multi shot mode.  Fastest reaction camera among these four.  it's fun, easy to use, and it works!!  no optical zoom would be the weakest point.Nikon Coolpix 775 is very small yet feature packed camera.  It even has movie mode(no sound).  Picture quality is also very nice.  Definitly should buy their original case(silver color).  it runs only $...(retail) and it fits perfect.  Very easy to change mode since there is a dial does it all.  Only complain I have is it makes clicking noise when you move the camera. It constantly adjusting and focusing.  kinda slow reaction.  Ok LCD display.HP 618ix is traditional typical Pentax looking camera.  It dosn't have much features but takes excellent pictures.  It's got Pentax lense and it's a good thing.  once again slow reaction but very solid camera.  can record voice on the photo you take.  I ended up buying a Rayovac 1hr charger and extra battery pack.  It doesn't last long as I wanted them to but good enough.(1 hr means really 1 hr).  very nice grip when taking pictures.  Looks like LCD on HP and Nikon are the similar type but worse than Nikon.  zooming in when reviwing picture makes picture blur and hard to see.  Another thing I din't like was there is playback mode and file management mode where you have to be in file manage mode to erase pictures you took not in play back mode.  kinda annoying.Polaroid Photomax2300Z is a vanilla 2.3x optical zoom camera.  Nothing special about it almost boring but it works.  It is too big compare to other three.  it's got rubber covers on the usb connector side and feels very cheap.  Cannot have one finger operation on the dial and feels cheap again.  Still take good photos just couldn't measure up against other cameras out there.These are the things you should look for on digital cameras nowadays considering they all pretty much take good photos.1. price range(budget it first)2. reaction time between shot to shot3. special features4. contants(rechargably battery and adapter)4. look and the built quality", "Date": "October 17, 2001"}, {"Title": "Nikon 775", "Author": "Gregory A R Trollope", "ReviewID": "R18NK1IWM7TVAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I selected this camera particularly because that while it has a rechargable battery, that if necessary you can use a 'one use' battery (2CR5).

I am a bit disappointed with taking pictures in a fairly low lit room, as it is difficult to see anything on the screen before you take the picture.  Because it is difficult to see, you end up trashing pictures and retaking them.  There is also a bit of wait time when you press the button to release the shutter and flash and when they actually go off.  I suppose I will get used to the delay, but may hinder taking action pictures when not taking a sequence of them.

I have this camera for about 2 weeks now and I am very disappointed.  There were more problems encountered than what the reviews stated.  The reviews written were more biased towards how great this camera is, though it should emphasize the problems it really has.Need to compare???  One way of telling how good a camera performs is by comparing it to others especially if the lower/cheaper models could outshine this one.I own the Kodak DC3200 ... and the Olympus Brio D-150 ... Digital camera. As for comparisons to the Nikon 775 ..., the Kodak DC3200 took clearer pictures.  The Kodak is only 1 mega pixel but the pictures were sharper and colors were closer to what your eye would see outdoors.  Indoors, the Kodak tends to overexpose (too bright) the subject while in the flash range.  The Kodak pictures taken are clear from the beginning without shrinking the image.  The Nikon on the other hand have pictures that are not as clear full size, but when printed on a 4x6 it becomes clearer.  Therefore it would be hard to get a clear picture with the Nikon when looking at it on your computer.  These pictures are not as appealing when posting it on the net.As for the Olympus, it has better color tones but it was somewhat blurry as well (not too sharp).  I guess it helps when taking pictures of people so it can give the subject a smoother look and to hide any imperfections.  For detailed pictures, this might not be a good camera to get.  There are more comparisons to discuss but I would not spend any more time at it.  More focus would be emphasized on the Nikon 775 below.Here are my own observations of the Nikon Coolpix 775:I have taken indoor, outdoor, flash, macro, increased sharpness settings, white balance.....First of all there were red and blue/green rainbow colors on the pictures.  Those imperfections are there no matter what settings.  There would be blotchy red spots in the pictures typically but the blue/green colors are there too.  Some settings reduce those color imperfections but it does not eliminate it.  If you take pictures of a subject that contains those colors, it will hide through those colors thus slightly emphasizing the color red, blue and green.  That would be fine with me, but it should not come out on areas where those colors are not present.  It seems to form in horizontal bands, but it also appears randomly across the picture.  These bands are not pronounced but it is seen fairly easily.  These abnormal colors are more distinct in gray and in typical skin colors (flesh).As far as software is concerned, there will always be bugs in it including your own operating system.  You can use other picture editing software once you upload the pictures to your computer through via USB.  Transfer Errors also occurred while uploading pictures sometimes.  Check with Nikon for updates.Another problem would be sunspots on the pictures.  They only appeared on shots I took indoors with the flash.  The spots would appear as if you placed tiny droplets of water on the lens.  It does not appear all the time, but it appears once in while in random places.  I fear that the flash itself may have caused it to appear.Significant Delay Problem???  Press the button... Click...  1 to 2 seconds later...  Snap...  Picture taken.The red eye reduction does not work too well.  The red eye is still pronounced on the pictures I took.  Of course, red eye will always be severe on shots taken inline with the flash.  In other words, the closer to the center the subjects are, the red eye would be more severe.Lastly, one thing nice about this camera is its size and weight so you can easily put it in your pocket.  But when I placed it on my jean pocket, the lint/dust in that pocket or some sort of particles penetrated inside the camera.  It has fogged up the viewfinder inside (between the front and rear glass) with dust/lint looking things.  I could see some of the dust settling on the lens as well.  Both those areas are supposed to be sealed when not in use especially the viewfinder internally.Now for what I liked about the Nikon camera:The 3x zoom is a plus.  Its ergonomics makes it easy to hold.  I like the dial settings of different moods on the Nikon 775, which the Canon S110 lacks (currently the 2 most popular cameras).  The Nikon has a special function for macro shots instead of just zooming in close to take clearer pictures.  The movie shots are good as well, but it lacks sound.I won't complain about the 8mb flash card, its obvious by now that it is not enough and it has nothing to do with the 3 stars given.  Anyways, Flash memory is cheap these days.  It is better for the camera manufacturers not to spend more money on the memory initially to keep the cost lower.  Since memory prices generally goes down all the time, it is to the advantage of the consumer in the long run.The Nikon comes with a rechargeable battery that last pretty long.  For international travel, the 100-240Volt charger (included) helps.  The battery never ran out on me for the whole day.  It just depends how you use the camera.  Previewing pictures all the time means using the LCD screen often thus consuming more power.In conclusion:To me, keeping this camera means it should satisfy 5 main factors; Image quality, features, convenience, size and reliability.  In my opinion, this Nikon Coolpix 775 needs more improvements especially on image quality.  If this is one of the best in its class the market could give at this time, then so be it.

Although you can't set aperture and shutter speeds manually, there are plenty of ways to control your images through custom white balance, flash, and exposure compensation features.  The manual is also very well written and easy to understand.  There are two reasons why I don't give it 5 stars: 1)Custom settings are not saved if you turn the camera off.  Once you switch it back on, everything is set back to default settings, and many of these custom settings are only accessible through the menus (although they are very easy to navigate).  2)You cannot mannually set white balance, flash, or exposure compnesation if you are in one of the scene modes.  You can accomplish what you want in auto mode where you can get to these settings, but it would be quicker to dial in a scene mode then be able to change just one setting (i.e. flash).  All in all, though, this in an excellent buy for a family point-n-shoot digital camera.  One thing, you had better buy a bigger memory card - the 8mb card that is included just won't do it if you're shooting at the highest resolution.  I suggest 96mb or higher.

But I wanted to see it in real life, just to ensure all the reviews where genuine. And so I did. And in one word, I would have to say I was Disappointed. First off, it takes about 1-2 seconds for the shutter to respond from when you take the photo. That might not sound like much, but from the 10 shots I took of people walking in the store, everyone of those shots resulted in the person completely out of the scene by the time the shot went off. So I guess if all you want to do is take still photography, this might not be a big deal. Second, the flash didn't work for more than 5 feet. I took photos inside the store, and anything beyond about 5 feet, turned out to be pretty dark. I compared these photos to a Canon s110, and the canon took far better photos inside the store.So that's my review. I was extremely disappointed. I like the size of the camera; i like the preset modes; and i like the nikon brand, but these two issues where just too much for me to overlook.", "Date": "December 19, 2001"}, {"Title": "The best camera I have ever bought!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RZOV4G7R40P3G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon Coolpix 775 is simply the best camera investment I have ever made. The camera is very easy to operate, delivers beautiful premium quality photographs, and is compact enough to fit [literally] in your pocket. We have taken ours to the Caribbean, and gotten beautiful shots of beaches and palm trees. We have taken it skiing in France and Utah, and each time we were even able to take it with us on the slopes (yep, it really does fit comfortably into your pocket)! All in all, this is one amazing product. We got ours when it was fairly new, so we paid a great deal more than it is listed for here, but I assure you that even doing that was incredibly worth it! If you are a casual photographer who enjoys the fun of taking and sharing photographs of your adventures in life, this is the camera for you.

It was easy to use, had a nice size and fit our budget. However, we took photos of a family event over the weekend, and comparing those photos with some photos from a friend's Canon Elph S-110, we noticed significant picture quality differences. Our photos from our family event (which was indoors) looked grainy and overly \"noisy.\" Lots of added pixels, banding, etc. The indoor shots from the Canon were clearer, and more solid. Also, the Canon had a much brighter flash which captured more detail. The Nikon, even on the indoor party setting, was not nearly as sharp. I was surprised and disapointed at these results. The Canon flesh tones seemed to run more yellow, the Nikon flesh tones seemed to run more true; but I can balance that all out in Photoshop. The Nikon banding and extra noise, though, really affected picture quality for us. Also, the movie mode in the Canon includes sound, whereas the Coolpix does not. In the end, after 1 day of use we exchanged the Coolpix for an Elph S-110, and have been extremely happy.", "Date": "November 14, 2001"}, {"Title": "this is a terrible camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2DLDUYLLKORZQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this camera for the first year and a half was ok, ie (kind of slow when deleting pictures). and now just a month ago it had the \"system error problem, which you either attempt to fix it yourself or spend...and have the camera sit at nikon costumer service for a month.  i would advice no one to buy this camera.", "Date": "November 24, 2003"}, {"Title": "You can probably do better", "Author": "M.
