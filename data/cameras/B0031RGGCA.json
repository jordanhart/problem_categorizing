{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Capable Low Cost Camera", "Author": "The Folded Space", "ReviewID": "R32WJTVOB2GZN6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The M575 is essentially a feature-stripped version of the M580. By reducing the zoom from 10x to 5x and ditching the HDMI output, both price and weight are reduced. In fact, one of the Amazon sellers offers this model for a very low price.The capabilities of this model are fairly average, but its wide angle and 720p video mode make it worthwhile. The settings are easy to get to from a fairly logical menu. The screen is bright and sharp - only bettered by cameras with OLED displays. A surprising feature is the long exposure mode. This is more or less shutter priority and isn't usually found on cameras at this price. I also appreciate the 3:2 aspect ratio because most labs still print this format whereas I was annoyed by the 4:3 and 16:9 shots getting cropped.Some may find the lack of HDMI output a problem, but if your main goal is to publish your videos on the web, who needs it? I've been using a small Western Digital player to display all my video on a television and didn't need this feature.The worst aspect of this camera and so many others in its class is the high pixel density on a small chip. Kodak is still in the megapixel race when cameras this size should've stopped at 10 megapixels. The images can be grainy. A tripod improves any of these. Of course, I find the snapshots quite acceptable.I recommend this camera for beginners and penny-pinchers.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "great and wonderful", "Author": "Barbara Kolb", "ReviewID": "R2CCA4JMRNE4P8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not sure what the reviewers where talking about when they posted such negative feedback.  I have only had my camera for a couple of days, so i will update my post in a couple weeks to let you know how my camera is working. However, i take a lot of pics of my kids and have had no problem with the quality of my pictures that I have taken.  They are clear and very nice, not grainy.I also love the looks of this camera.  I had owned a kodak before this camera and loved it that is why i bought the newer version, they make them very \"dummy\" proof! ;-) I hate trying to figure out what all the buttons are for and what they mean, kodak is very simple to figure out!

I actually had to ask another person who owned this camera to run me through some things and when asked how he knew he said he had to play with it at length to find everything and use it.  The directions are not specific enough for me I am 63 and not that hip with all the new technology.  It is also extremely hard to take a picture out in the sunlight as you can only look at the screen on the back and not into a little space to view your target.  On a bright day you do not know what the heck you are looking at and have to guess at what picture you will end up with.  I wished I had researched more camera's before choosing this one, so for the time being I will use it until it makes me crazy and then it will be in the garbage..do you homework with this one..", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "M575 cannot be charged via a USB port!!!", "Author": "Deborah Noack", "ReviewID": "R1M1C630C732HK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Contrary to the current most halpful favorable review, this camera cannot be charged via your computer's USB port.

All produced great looking images when you had the right lighting with vivid colors and good detail.  I have moved on to a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR1 (absolutely love it!!), but my wife still liked her Kodak.  They are easy to use point and shoot cameras and she likes to be able to get quick pics of our 3 and 5 years olds.  Her old Kodak was starting to show its age with lower resolution and buttons starting to not respond, but hey, the camera has taken thousands of pictures over the past 3 or 4 years, so we got our money's worth.Kodak came out with some new models in April and it looked like I finally found a replacement for her current camera.  It had up to 14MP resolution, wider angle shooting and a nice overall design.  I pre-ordered it and waited a month or so for delivery.  Once it arrived, the overall look and feel were very nice.  I set it up for my wife and she started taking pictures.  I would have thought that with a 14MP camera, we would have sharper, clearer pictures, but that wasn't the case.  Pictures were over saturated and grainy.  Picture after picture turned out this way.  I adjusted the settings to turn off the constant autofocus and a few other manual settings, but they reset back to the defaults every time I turned the camera back on.  I found some presets that seemed to do better, but it is now a 3 or 4 step process to get them, which makes them useless when you are chasing small children.  There is one button to change multiple settings now (movie, presets, timer, etc.), so you have to go through the menu on the screen to get to the settings, then scroll through the settings to get the one you want.  It used to be one button for presets, one for movie).  i also found the buttons clumsy and too close together, making it hard to turn the camera off and on.I am extremely disappointed with camera.  Features are hard to use, the buttons are clumsy and the pictures are well below acceptable and not suitable for printing or viewing.  Images are over saturated and have lots of noise and there is no way to make setting changes quickly.  Not what I would have expected from a new Kodak model.  I would avoid this camera.  I can't think of anyone that would be satisfied with the quality of the pictures and navigating to features and settings.I returned the camera within just a few days after receiving it and am still looking for that perfect point and shoot for my wife.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the money!", "Author": "Dave in Vegas \"Dave in MV\"", "ReviewID": "R258LITPI97GY7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had the camera for about a month and only taken about 140 pictures so far, but it is performing very well.

It looks beautiful (very cute, fact) and feels sturdy. But the photos were beyond awful -- I have never, in my life, seen such bad, fuzzy photos.  Completely unusable.I immediately took the camera back to the store and was told they had \"no way\" of recouping money from Kodak for a faulty product so they could not take the camera back. I went home and chatted with two technicians online at Kodac Support. Neither was helpful although both tried. The first one put me through a lot of dopey (but necessary, I suppose) stuff like taking out the SD card and battery and reinserting. He also made some other suggestions and I signed off to try them. Didn't work so I went back to chat with a second technician who had me take a photo by putting the camera on a table top and using timed delay. The photo was fuzzy and nowhere near acceptable. Obviously, the camera is defective so she advised me to pack up it up and send it in for repair.I told her I was leaving the country within a few hours (true) and could not do as requested. She assured me that the warranty was good one year. I explained that I need a camera, now! She explained there was no way to exchange the camera for one that works.Just nuts. I will never buy another thing from Kodak or from this dealer. What has happened to customer service? Companies should realize that frustrating buyers like this will not get them through the recession. Quite the contrary, I think.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "Antnvik", "ReviewID": "RNIT0QAJLEGNG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I love Kodak cameras and have owned several film and two digital.  My last was a DX model that I adore but wanted to upgrade to something a little higher megapixel and faster turn around from picture to picture.  I felt pretty confident with the brand Kodak, so I did a fair amount of research and decided on the M575 after reading good reviews.  I got it for Christmas last year and have gone back to my old DX model after a few months.The camera takes great outdoor pictures - beautiful color, crisp and nice.  But inside the pictures are awful.  The white balance is strange and all my indoor pictures have a yellow tone.  I've tried all of the scene settings and either get a somewhat decent color or tons of blur and red eye.  My old camera had a fast capture so I rarely got blur of movement.  On this one, I can't get a motion picture especially indoors.  I have two kids and I have to move fast to capture a moment.I agree with the other review that talked about expecting a lot sharper picture for the 14 megapixel.  I too get a lot of grainy pictures.The body is nice, easy to hold, nice lens, good screen, pretty easy to point and shoot.  Easy to download pictures, easy to charge and download pictures.  Thought the Facebook feature and easy share email was great. Slim enough to fit in your pocket.So, in essence, it will be a great starter camera for a kid, but if you are looking for a fast shutter to capture action indoors, this isn't it.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kodak 14MP Digital Camera", "Author": "unscspc", "ReviewID": "R3PS4PICTDLMU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great quality pictures.
