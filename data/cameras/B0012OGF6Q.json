{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just beginning to learn  how to use it, but I love it", "Author": "pm444 \"pm444\"", "ReviewID": "R38HB2LEAYDWJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Canon PowerShot point-and-shoot digital cameras for the past 6 years, and because they're so small, portable, and unobtrusive, I've ended up taking a lot more photos that I ever did, because I had my camera with me.  The good thing is that I've taken a lot more pictures, and most of them have been very good (the camera gets much of the credit here).  But the bad thing is that I started to reach the limits of what a point-and-shoot camera can do.The biggest problems I had with my compact point-and-shoot camera was the lag between shots and the generally poor performance in low-light settings.  For most shots, these weren't big problems, but when they were a problem, they were a huge problem, and there's not much you can to solve it without moving to a better camera.  I don't think I'm the first person to reach a brick wall when using compact digital cameras, which is why there are now some excellent options that don't cost a fortune.After reading a lot of reviews for digital SLR cameras online, I narrowed it down to two choices:  the Sony A300 or the Nikon D60.  I love my compact Canon, but I wasn't all that impressed with the Canon dSLR's that I looked at, either in terms of price or features.The Sony is priced very competitively and offers some great features, such as auto-focus and image stabilization built into the camera itself, not relying on the lens.  The A300 also has live preview on the LCD screen, which the D60 doesn't offer (live preview is what you get on a compact camera:  you see what you are shooting as you take the picture).  Finally, the A300 has more focus points than the Nikon.  I spent a long time in several stores doing side-by-side comparisons of these two cameras.  After many test shots, I finally chose the D60 for the following reasons:  it felt more compact and less heavy than the Sony, I liked the way the lens felt when I was zooming, its LCD menu system was much clearer and more intuitive, and the Nikkor family of lenses is unbeatable.  With a dSLR, it really gets down to which line you want to commit to for future lens purchases.  I wasn't sure I wanted to go with Sony, when Nikon is well-known for quality optics.I ordered the D60 from Amazon and I'm glad I did, since they have a 30-day price match policy.  If the price of the camera decreases within 30 days of your purchase, all you have to do is email Amazon, and they'll credit you with the difference.  The price of the D60 went down three times after my purchase (it's even lower now, but I've passed my 30 days), and Amazon was fast to process the refund for each decrease.  Please note that it's your responsibility to check on the current price.  Amazon will not notify you that the price has gone down, and why should they?  So if you do buy this from Amazon, be sure to check every couple of days to see what the current price is.As for the camera and the lens, I couldn't be happier.  I love how it feels and how easy it is to use, at least for basic shots.  Of course it won't fit in my pocket the way my point-and-shoot did, but it's not nearly as huge or heavy as I'd expected.  The kit lens has VR (vibration reduction) which is a good thing to have, and it's well balanced with the compact body of this camera.  In other words, the camera doesn't point down under the weight of the lens.  Everyone who has tried out my new camera has commented on how compact and ergonomic it feels.The camera works extremely well in low-light settings, with or without flash (you can defeat the flash if you want, and I find that in many situations, I get better results that way).  The flash is a lot more powerful than what you get on a compact camera, and the coverage is more even.So far, I've mainly used the \"auto\" mode, but I've taken some pictures in macro mode.  It's graat to be able to take pictures in rapid succession, without having to wait the way you do with a point-and-shoot.  Most important of all, the image quality is outstanding. The difference is noticeable and consistently better than what I was getting with my point-and-shoot.The LCD menu is intuitive and visually appealing.  That was one of the reasons I went with the Nikon in the first place, and I haven't been disappointed.  By pressing the right button as you move the mode dial, you can see a description of what each mode does, which is very helpful.  It's sort of like having a \"help\" system built into the camera, without having to carry around the instructions.  Having said that, the instruction manual is really quite good.  It won't teach you everything you need to know about digital SLRs, but it does a good job of explaining the camera's features.  Nevertheless, I recommend buying a more extensive guide book which is specific to the Nikon D60 (there is one by David Busch which is currently available, and several more are scheduled to appear within the next couple of months).So, I love this camera, especially at the very reasonable price point.  However, there are some things that you should consider before making a final decision.  First, the D60 will only provide auto-focus with Nikkor AF-S lenses.  That means that most Nikon \"prime\" lenses will require manual focusing.  That wasn't a big deal for me, but it is a limitation.  Second, the D60's 3 focus points put it at the low end for this feature. Third, the D60 uses SD cards, while the Sony uses Compact Flash cards, as do many higher-end dSLRS.  This isn't really a plus or minus, since SD cards are generally less expensive than Compact Flash, but some users say that Compact Flash cards may be more durable in the long run (they're larger and thicker). Finally, unlike the Sony, the D60 does not provide live preview.  In other words, you don't see the image on the LCD until after you have taken it.With all of that, I'm very pleased with my decision and I am having a lot of fun with my Nikon D60.  If you're ready to move up from your point-and-shoot to a dSLR, you cannot go wrong with the D60.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera but not a big upgrade", "Author": "Mishal", "ReviewID": "R1ODR1GZXKWIZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "D60 is the upgrade for D40x which I owned previously. The differences between two are too small to justify upgrading from D40x. If you own D40 and would like more resolution then D60 may fit the bill. For D40x owners only real advantage is the VR lens which is probably only slightly better than the non-VR one that comes with D40x (for the zoom range of 18-55mm). Off course I am not forgetting D-Lighting which is a much touted feature but I didn't see noticeable difference in quality. Using Active D-Lighting makes the camera take longer to save pictures. It could take a few seconds before you can review the photo on LCD.For people looking for their first DSLR camera, D60 is a great choice. It is very easy to use and provides excellent images without requiring a lot of technical knowledge. Actually the images I produced with my D60 (and D40x) were better and sharper than everybody else in my photography class (with students using anything from compact and semi-pro point and shoot cameras, Canon XT and XTi and Olympus E-510). It doesn't have live view which I would've liked because I plan to use tripod for a lot of my shots. Like its predecessors, it doesn't have an auto-focus motor in the body so your lens selection is limited but for a beginner that shouldn't be an issue. It would've been nice to have higher flash sync speed but hey you can't have it all. I have no regrets about buying D60 (I had a bunch of unused gift cards from Christmas so I didn't have to pay a lot from my pocket).Here is my advice for you: If you are looking for an easy to use DSLR which take excellent photos and can afford it then buy it. I would definitely recommend D60 over D40x (unless you are saving a couple of hundred dollars or more). If you are on a budget then go with D40 which is an excellent camera and should now be even cheaper.If you are buying this camera (or D40), I highly recommend getting 55-200 VR lens which is around $200. Add that to the kit lens and throw in an SB-400 or SB-600 flash and you'll have a set up that is hard to beat for about a grand. D60 is a lot of camera in a small body.After having the camera for a few months, I still love it. It produces pictures as good as or better than Canon's new Xsi and for a lot less. At around $630 for the kit, it is a great deal.", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great DSLR, if you know what you're doing", "Author": "T. Lin", "ReviewID": "R12I94WLB8WW15", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*** Updated 4/9/08 ***Here's the quick reminder:  it's not the camera, it's the photographer.  Maybe, maybe a nice fast lens would help.Like most things in life, it doesn't really matter how \"good\" or how expensive the equipment is, it's really how \"well\" you can use it.  You can own the best racket in the world, but Roger Federer will still beat you with a wooden racket any day.Such is the case for the D60.  It has more than enough features to produce great pictures.  If you take the time to learn all its functions, you'll find that for an entry level DSLR, it's a great camera.  If you think about it, all you really need in a camera are controls for shutter speed, aperature, and focus.  For me (pure amateur), 95% of the time I'm shooting in Aperature-priority mode.  The only other settings I might touch from time to time are the ISO and white balance settings.  Most likely you'll do the same.Pluses:- light & compact- ultrasonic sensor cleaner, matched with a airflow control system (keeps the sensor dust free!)- 420-pixel RGB 3D Color Matrix Metering II (compares against over 30,000 pics stored in database to achieve best exposure, available only with Nikon D or G type lenses)- pretty good performance from built-in flash- ISO 3200 available- ISO 100 available (this is becoming a rarity)- Active D-Lighting (automatically compensates over or under exposed areas in a high contrast scene)- LCD screen shuts off when eye is close to viewfinder (saves power)- very quick startup, you can take a picture as soon as you turn the camera on, even if flash is needed- SDHC compatible (I use an 8GB card!)Minuses:- not so great focusing in poor lighting, only 3 focus points, sometimes wrong objects are focused on- Auto ISO doesn't always choose the right ISO- the all \"Auto\" mode produces slightly oversaturated pictures- slightly \"noisy\" from ISO 800 and above, but noise reduction is available- no built-in auto focus motor, Nikon AF-S/AF-I lenses or third party lenses with built-in focus motor are necessary, unless you like to manually focusIf you're looking the DSLR that can do many wonderful things but don't have a whole lot to spend, this is the camera to get.  It may not have as many pixels (who really needs more than 10mp?), nor does it have the large 3\" LCD screen like the D300 or D3, but for a fraction of the price, you can take just as good pictures.  Point is, rather than spending $1000 more on a D300, you're much better off getting the D60 and spending the $1000 on a nice fast lens.The only reason I'm giving this camera 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the average focusing performance.  3 focus points are adequate, but having more focus points and a faster focus system would speed up overall focusing and wouldn't have as much trouble in poor lit conditions.And don't buy into all that hoopla about the D60 not having VR (Vibration Reduction) built-in.  First off, there are plenty of new lenses coming out with VR built-in.  Second, I'd trade VR for a 2.8 lens ANYDAY!So, unless you have a need to shoot fast actions in poor lighting conditions, get the D60.  It's SO worth the money.  And remember, it's not about the megapixels or the size of the LCD screen, or the VR, or whatever, it's about YOU, the photographer!!!", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Digital SLR", "Author": "Anthony Dake \"eosix\"", "ReviewID": "R1YKPG8BP0NGZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is My first Nikon. I have been a fan of Canon and Olympus for many years. Previous to this camera, I was using an Olympus Evolt 500. The E-500 is a good camera. However, it is older and some aspects of the 500 bugged me. The view finder could have been a little clearer, the focus could have been faster and although the picture quality was good, it still wasn't quite at the level I wanted. I was on the verge of buying two new lenses, which were better and more expensive than the two kit lenses, and a external flash. Then one day while I was out at the big Warehouse Store shopping, I saw the Nikon D60 kit with camera bag and two lenses and for about the same cost as I was ready to spend on my 500. I knew this camera had great reviews and was one of the top 10 recommended digital SLR's on one of my favorite camera review sites. So I bought it and put my 500 up for sale and am happy I did. The quality is very good. Colors are great and so is detail. Overall the D60 is easier to use. I can figure out settings very quickly. The D60 is also fast. Much faster than my 500 when it comes to quick pictures in succession. The D60 also has a very nice shutter click that I like. One thing I noticed about the eye piece cover is that it was tough to put on. Once I finally got it on fully, with a click, I couldn't take it off too easily. In my attempt to remove it, one side broke, but only a piece of it. It came off then and since it is only a cover for when your not actually looking through the eyepiece to take a picture, it now fits on and off nicely! A happy accident. Battery life was quite good. Another good thing is that the 18mm - 55mm zoom lens gets me closer for macro shots better than the kit lenses for the 500. Good enough that I don't feel compelled to get a dedicated macro lens at this time. All in all the D60 is great. I am very satisfied with it. I highly recommend it if you are one of those getting into digital SLR's for the first time.

I'll just focus on why D40 users need to upgrade.Second, I dont recommend D40x users to upgrade to this model! true the new futures are a plus however, personally I find it not a big difference. unless you like to keep up with latest technology releases and don't mind paying the extra dollars :)If you wish to upgrade from the D40 (as I am) you need to consider the reason for your upgrade.Reason 1- Is it for taking better quality photos or your current camera is old?Reason 2- Or, found out you are stepping to the advance photography level and you want to upgrade from your D40? (becoming an obsessed amature)Answering reason 1:If you are happy with your current D40 but you need to upgrade because its old or you need higher Mega Pixels or you want more (a bit) better images? then this D60 is a perfect upgrade why because the D60 on the auto-settings takes much crispier spot-on shots than the D40 just by doing a shot by shot comparison you will find the D60 have the upper hand due to some of the following new features;  - Active D-lightning (No more underexposed photos).  - The new Expeed sensor (as in the D300, reduced ISO noise)  - The new VR Lens which produce sharper images.  - The Dust reduction is a big plus  - supporting 4GB SDHC cards.Answering reason 2:The D60 camera does not have the following:  - No DOF preview  - No Bracketing  - Does not trigger speed-flash remotely such as SB-600/800  - Mirror Lock-up (for taking super steady shots)  - only three active focus points.  - only one Command dial  - No Build in AF motor (limiting the amount of lenses you use)It is not necessarily to have any of the above (specially to amatures and beginners) and you can always have a work around those features. however, when you start attending advanced photography courses or workshops with top National Geography Photographers you will find yourself looking handicap because you lack the functions whom my other fellow photographers have... or specially when you get to a level that you work in a pro environment and you need  least fail factor while taking shots or the ability to work within a studio environment. then yes, you need the above features even more (which i did not mention). and this D60 is not the right upgrade for you.I just want to make it clear for those who want to upgrade or before buying a new DSLR. because if you are new, and you feel one day you will get to the advance level (or, least becoming an obsessed amature) I prefer you invest on a D300 or atleast a D80.other than that, this camera is the best DSLR I ever saw targeting the entry level photographers.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice balance of technology and price!", "Author": "Alan G.", "ReviewID": "R37UPODJ3QM900", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't pass up the D60 just because it's called \"entry level\". This unassuming camera is very well made, doesn't cost a fortune, has a lot of features, and is capable of producing stunning photos, depending on the user.  Here's my overview of what you're getting, what you're not, and why I bought it.What you're getting is Nikon engineering in a compact body with very good ergonomics and all the necessary features you need to shoot in most situations -that is, for people who enjoy photography as a creative hobby, not a profession.  If you're an average person, like me, who does occasional shooting, likes creativity and demands quality results, the D60 is a good camera to work with.  It's light and comfortable without being flimsy.  That means you're more likely to take it with you, rather than debating whether to carry around a heavy semi-pro beast.You also get the latest technology such as the Expeed processor, in-camera Raw Conversion and Active D-lighting.  And you get the 18-55VR lens. I added the 55-200VR. Both lenses are lightweight and capable. Between the lens and the lightmeter, I've taken some really stunning photos in varied situations. The lenses are not optically fast, but VR works well to steady the camera when needed.  I plan on adding a fast prime for lowlight and everyday use.Here's what you're not getting:-Live View mode. I really liked this on my P&S; and I'll miss it, but I remember this feature really drains battery life, which was really annoying (and they haven't perfected it in SLRs yet).-No Auto Focus with older Nikon AF lenses, but the D60 has a rangefinder feature which allows you to pull up an analog focusing meter in the viewfinder.-You don't get a lot of direct access buttons on the body. There are some, but most picture settings have to be made on a grid on the LCD screen.  It's pretty easy to do and it keeps the D60 uncluttered, but I'd much rather have the buttons.-Lastly, higher-end models generally give you a stronger build quality, a bigger, brighter viewfinder and a more enhanced AF system with more AF points.  Still, the D60 is no slouch in these areas. Its viewfinder is bright and its 3-point AF seems fast enough for me.I have to say though, I really  liked handling the other strong, ruggedly-built SLRs, like the Nikon D300 and Canon 40D, but when the chips are down, I just don't want to carry all that weight around, especially on vacation. You would have to decide if you really want all the features of a higher end camera because it really adds to the size, weight and especially COST. Everything's a tradeoff.My main reason for choosing Nikon over Canon and Olympus was because they use the largest image sensor, followed by Canon;  Olympus was just too small.  I took the measurements of these sensors, drew each of them on a grid next to each other and the actual size difference really became apparent.  And even though the other brands still do a great job with image quality and some reviewers try to explain away the size issue, I still believe that EVERY little bit of sensor real estate helps with image quality. But, hey that's just me.As for ergonomics, I considered some Canons, but they felt rather boxy and cramped to me, and they all use that obnoxious pop-up strobing flash as an AF assist light. Nikon uses a steady lamp. I loved the Olympus 420, but it was so compact that the metal strap holder constantly dug into my middle finger. Mounting a heavy lens made it feel oddly unbalanced. The E510 was very comfortable, even more so than the D60. It really helps to pick up these models and handle them.Buying a digital SLR body is like buying a computer. The sensor is the heart of the camera, so I looked for the latest model with the newest processor.  I REALLY liked the D80, but even though it's a great body, I couldn't see spending hundreds more on what I consider a \"2 year old computer\" that may be discontinued soon.  Unless you're a pro, you're probably going to purchase just one DSLR body, so I'd say invest in one with enough current technology to last for a while along with most of the features you think you need.That's where the D60 comes in. It's a nice balance of current technology at a reasonable price.  The fact that you're even considering this model means that value is of some concern to you, so striking that balance is important.  Yes, it may be missing a bell here or a whistle there, but overall it's a great little camera. The lightmeter works extremely well, the processor is fast, the lenses are sharp, the images are excellent. And the price is right.UPDATE 8/29/08: Just 2 months after I passed on the aging D80, it was replaced by the D90,  which is more in line with what I want in a DSLR . But I still love the D60 and how affordable it is for the  results you get. Occasionally, I toss it into my bag on the way to work in NY.  I stop at various locations around the city and really enjoy using it.  What surprised me most, is  that when it's in my bag I BARELY notice the extra weight. It's just not a problem at all. It proves how good a walkaround camera this one is.  Makes me want to go out and shoot even more.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Images, Lightweight and Well-Built", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2GKI2T8HW592E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera, and don't let anyone tell you it's only for beginners. The images that the D60 produces easily rival that of more expensive cameras. When you spend less money on the D60, you are sacrificing a few bells & whistles but not necessarily image quality.It has all the manual settings you'd expect in an SLR and a very easy-to-navigate (and nice-looking) menu system. The LCD screen is big and bright, and the viewfinder is great as well.What it's missing (at least when compared to higher end models) and why you don't necessarily need those things:- No auto-focus on non-AF-S/AF-I lenses. Unless you already have a bunch of old Nikon lenses, this shouldn't be a problem. Just make sure any lens you buy in the future is an AF-S or AF-I.- No Live View. This is only just becoming standard on higher end cameras and on the ones I have tried I have found it very \"clunky\" anyway. \"Live View\" is a hallmark of compact point & shoot cameras, and I think that's where it belongs... at least for now. SLRs are just made for shooting with the viewfinder. It just feels better on a camera like this. If you *need* Live View, look at the Sony SLRs. They seem to implement that feature best.- Only 3 auto focus points. The D80 has 11, the Canon XSi has 9, blah, blah, blah. Three is enough for most people... heck, one is enough for most people. Yes, having more is nice, but honestly if you are a beginner and don't understand what the benefit of more AF points might even be, you don't need them.- No exposure bracketing. A helpful feature for making HDR images, but even then it is not necessary.Those are the biggies. I have my own little nit picks, like:- No dedicated buttons for ISO or white balance (you can program the Fn button to do it, but it's nice to have a seperate button).- RAW+JPEG setting only allows you to record a \"basic\" quality JPEG.- The ViewNX software supplied with the camera sucks for processing RAW images. If you are going to shoot RAW, get something better like Nikon's CaptureNX, Adobe Camera Raw for Photoshop or Lightroom, or something similar. If those aren't in your budget, RAW Therapee is a great open source RAW processing application. It's light years better than ViewNX in this regard, and it is 100% free of charge!Now for the major perks:- The D60 inherits features like Active D-Lighting and Expeed processing from the (much more expensive) D3 and D300 pro SLRs, which the D40 and D40x do not have. Look those things up to see what the benefits are. D-Lighting is subtle, but effective.- The new kit lens with VR (vibration reduction, Nikon's term for image stabilization) which allows for sharp pictures in lower light conditions when using slower shutter speeds. The D40/D40x have a non-VR version of the same lens. In my opinion, this is the best \"kit\" lens when compared to what the competition is currently offering (in terms of overall image quality).- Auto focus assist lamp. Trust me, it's a simple little thing but you'll love having it.- FAST auto focus (even with those three piddly AF points =)- Big, bright LCD and viewfinder.- Superb build quality. Feels much more \"pro\" in your hand than it's plastic-y competitors.- Great high ISO performance. Perfectly usable shots at ISO 1600. ISO 3200 is worse, but you could still use it in a pinch and get decent results and small prints. I've printed a couple 8x10s from ISO 1600 shots that look fantastic.- Which brings me to the most important feature: stellar image quality. Go find sample images online and see for yourself. Forget those chart & graph test shots. Look for real-world samples of real people/things -- that's where you'll really be able to see the D60 shine!I love my D60. I have been shooting with it every day since I bought it a month ago and have no regrets. It truly is a great camera to learn on for the SLR beginner, but is just as good for those of us with a little experience who are on a budget and don't see the above \"cons\" as deal breakers.

I now know what IT likes, doesn't like, and how to fix its mistakes.Pros:1. Quite lightweight2. Sturdy3. Very quick boot-up time.4. Battery lasts a flabbergasting amount of time (camera on all day? No problem!) because of its chary use of power.A word to the wise: Either have it on or have it off. Do not toggle back and forth.\"On\" and in its powersaver mode saves more power than turning it off when sporadically taking photos. This might be due to the sensor cleaner (it cleans on start up and shut down).5. It thinks about as fast as you do.6. Acceptable buffer space for taking multiple shots 'on the go'.7. Most controls are intuitive (still SOME menu-hunting, though. Some important crap is just plain buried in the menus).8. Does *amazing* things with  grey/blue lighting. Its favorite situation seems to be a cloudy or partly cloudy/overcast day.9. Noise levels are acceptable at least up to 800 ISO, which is nice. Past that, though, you're pushing it. The result is still workable, though, which is an achievement.10. SDHC Compatable -- I use a 16gb card.11. Active D-Lighting mode is nice if you're still going to insist on shooting in jpg.Almost completely useless if using RAW.Be prepared to make use of your buffer and shoot multiple pictures of the same thing for redundancy; it tends to not always choose the place you wish to focus. *Especially* when using Dynamic Area mode with Autofocus. It's sometimes seems to me like all I'm managing is blurry pictures, faster than ever. If I take more, it's more likely I get one that's usable.Cons:1. Often picks strange/insane exposures, ISO levels, etc, if left on Automatic Mode.I had it once, in full daylight, choose 760 ISO. WHY? God knows.It will generally err by underexposing a photo. This is at least more 'fixable' than overexposing, so that's your silver lining.2. Over-saturates the yellow/orange spectrum, and consistently creates photos that are too 'warm'.3. Hunts a lot in low lighting, no matter the ISO.When you've gotten so frustrated as to set it at \"HI\" (3200), give up.That said, when it DOES find its target, it captures it well.4. The flash is not impressive (except impressively BRIGHT) especially with the limitations it creates with external flash (and with how it jumps to the conclusion that you need it even in full daylight), but generally you do absolutely fine without it.If it tries to pop up the flash, just hold it down. That's what I do. LOL.5. The Nikon Transfer software has issues at times; it locks up and freezes often when transferring things off of HDHC cards of the size I use. I suggest buying a card reader (8-15 dollars depending how multifunctional you want it to be. Targus Digital TGR-CRD25 Universal 25-in-1 Memory Card Reader/Writer possibly) for less general frustration.If you DO NOT have a card reader, you cannot access the card through the camera.This means if you DO have a problem, there's no way to get your information off the card.You CANNOT bypass Nikon Transfer if it screws up. Information transfers only one way -- from the camera to the computer.The camera does not show up as a drive on either a Mac OR a PC, and not only THAT, your virus software might pop up thinking that Nikon Transfer is a trojan (it boots immediately upon plugging in the camera or a card reader with NEFs on it. This makes a Windows virus scanner wig out).6. It makes it very hard to trust that what you see in the camera's preview mode will be what you see on your computer. This is mainly because it IS untrustworthy.With that in mind, I can't recommend that you trust the in-camera editing software either.Take a pass on this feature.-Be prepared to shoot in RAW and learn how to use a digital darkroom. I use Adobe Camera Raw, tho I suspect that in some instances, Nikon's own software would translate the information better. It just depends on how you want your finished product to look.Unfortunately, if you let the camera create your photo as a jpg, you're stuck with whatever fool choices it has made, unable to 'fix' the error.Don't trust this camera's color rendering! :PIt's *so* much better to just clean it up in post-processing.-With all that out of the way:IF you shoot in RAW, and IF you take the time to post-process your photos, the work it does is simply jaw-dropping. This little camera can do some AMAZING work, if only you devote the time to nurturing your photos after the fact.Fortunately, once you have yourself a digital darkroom (Nikon's own, Adobe's, or other third-party programs that can process a NEF file), you'll find it very easy to get into the swing of things. You'll not want to go back once you experience the freedom that RAW brings. Don't worry; it only sounds complicated.This camera, for the price, is a gem.

At least with the D40, you'll have a much lower investment while you learn about photography.  Don't get me wrong, both take great pictures given the right conditions and lenses, but don't under-estimate the lack of an AF motor.If you have D60 money, I would STRONGLY recommend getting the D80 instead.  It may cost a little more, but you will quickly pay for that if you purchase the 50mm 1.8 lens that actually does autofocus on the D80 plus countless other older AF style lenses that do not AF on the D60 or D40.Again, the reason why I'm giving the D60 3 stars is not about the picture because it is a good camera, but it's very over priced as of this writing.

(Nikon D5000 12.3 MP DX Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens and 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD)  I used to use film SLRs extensively, but have been away from photography for some time and have been wanting a dSLR forever.  Now is the perfect time.  I am taking a major vacation where I will be shooting some shots in the jungle, so I wanted an improvement over my point-and-shoot camera in low light and other scenarios.  Although the D60 is definitely such an improvement, after playing around with this camera in low light, I just decided it would not do the trick.Let me start by listing the things that I do like about this camera, because there were many (these also apply to the D5000):-Takes good pictures in bright light-I like Nikon's menu systems.  Although it takes some learning and some menu options require multiple \"clicks,\" I found it intuitive and straight-forward.  You also can set-up \"my menu\" where you have fast access to your most-used features.  I recommend utilizing this feature.-The on-board help button that explains the features to you-The vibration reduction lenses really are helpful in reducing camera shake.  Out of the box, I didn't realize VR was automatically set to off on the lens, and turning it on really did make a difference in low light.-Definitely is an upgrade over a point-and-shoot.  Also with the lens kits, appears to be a fairly good value.Despite these positives, the D60 was not the camera for me.  First, when taking photos indoors (even the lights on), I found that I typically had to manually focus the camera because it would not find the correct focus.  Even then, the quality of the low-light photos is not great.  (Although it is an improvement over my canon point-and-shoot.)  I'm sure this is in part due to its processor and in part due to the fact that it only has 3 Auto-focus points.  Whatever the cause, the mediocre quality of low-light photos is something you'll want to seriously consider if you'll be shooting indoors.If you'd like to see the comparison yourself, you can view images I have posted for both cameras in the customer image galleries for the D60 (Nikon D60 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens) and D5000 (Nikon D5000 12.3 MP DX Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens and 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD)The 3 autofocus points is also just a general concern overall.  Even in the short time I had the camera, I found that the lack of auto-focus points affected my photo composition capabilities.  I do not like to have to hold the button half-way down to focus and then move my desired subject to a different part of the frame.  Plus, it makes it extremely difficult to shoot moving subjects.  For a bit more money, the D5000 has 11 autofocus points which adds many more possibilities in terms of composing the photo in the viewfinder.  It also has a 3-D auto-focus mode, which allows you to focus on a subject, and then keeps the focus on that subject when it moves by choosing a new focus point.  The D5000 is more expensive, but the upgrade from 3 to 11 focus points is an extreme improvement that I think will make a difference for even amateur photographers.  (Perhaps it doesn't make much of a difference for simple point and click, but if you are shopping for a dSLR, I doubt that is all you are planning to do.)In the few hours since I exchanged this for the D5000, I know that I have made the right choice.  I have noticed a dramatic improvement in the quality of the photos I have taken over the D60.  I have also discovered a number of additional features lacking in the D60 that are very useful.  Specifically, bracketing.  With bracketing, you can set the camera to automatically take multiple shots using different settings.  For example, you can use exposure bracketing, and it will take one shot at the normal exposure, one under-exposed, and one over-exposed.  This is extremely useful in difficult lighting settings where you may not have the time to fiddle with exposure compensation.  (There are other bracketing options as well.) According to some things I've read, Nikon removed this feature from the D40 series and D60 to \"dumb it down,\" but I really don't understand that at all.  This isn't a difficult feature to grasp, and it seems like it would be extraordinarily useful for novice photographers (like me) who haven't completely mastered getting the perfect shot, but who might face situations where they don't have time to fiddle through the menus.Overall, the things that this camera (D60) is missing that I already love about about my D5000 are:-11 auto-focus points(this has only 3. I think this will affect most users' capabilities with the camera)-An improved processor and better image quality, especially in low light-Bracketing (missing from this camera)-Numerous additional Scene modes (in addition to those this one provides)-More choices for Active D-Lighting (Ultra-high, High, low, etc. as opposed to just on/off in D60)-3-D Tracking Mode for auto-focus (which allows you to choose a focus point, and if the subject moves, the camera keeps focus on that subject... haven't tried this yet, but I'm anxious to.)-More on-camera retouching options-Higher resolution (although I'm not sure this will make a difference unless you're planning to blow up photos)(Some of these things may sound technical, but I didn't know what they were yesterday either!  You'll be amazed at how fast you'll learn by reading the manual and doing a little playing around.)It is up to you whether these improvements are worth the extra several hundred dollars.  For me, they were.  I simply don't want to be disappointed and end up buying a new dSLR in a few years.I also would like to briefly mention the fact that this camera is missing a live view, which is present on the D5000.  Personally, I would not use this as a deciding factor in your camera choice.  Although you are probably used to live view from your point-and-shoot, I think if you can manage to go back to a viewfinder for awhile, you'll actually like it.  It gives you a better eye for composition, and you don't have to mess with covering up the eyepiece to avoid light leaking in.  Plus, keep in mind that even in the D5000, the liveview is probably not what you're accustomed to from point-and-shoots.  Liveview systems in SLRs tend to be slow have have difficulty focusing, so if you switch solely for the liveview, you may be disappointed.  So give the lack of live view a shot and practice composing your photos in the viewfinder.  I think you'll be pleased once you get used to it.On that note, the D60 may lack video, which is present on more expensive models, but you should never, ever buy a dSLR because you want to take videos.  It may be a perk, but if your hope is to shoot amazing video, you will surely be disappointed.  Get an HD-camcorder instead.In sum, this is a decent camera, but only having 3 autofocus points makes it not worth its price, even though that price is quite reasonable.  The D5000 is a few hundred dollars more, but its capabilities and quality are vastly improved.  (Note that you could go even further upscale for just a bit more to the D90, although that is a bigger, bulkier camera, which may not be as good for travel.)  If you're going to spend the money to spring for a dSLR, you might as well get something that you'll be happy with for a long time.If, on the other hand, you'll be photographing primarily outdoors, and you really don't think you need the D5000, the D60 is a perfectly acceptable camera.  Although, if that's the case, you may also consider the cheaper D40.  I have never tested one and cannot speak to the differences between the D40 and D60, but with only 3 Auto-focus points, I wonder what the D60 really adds. (I know it has a cleaning system and D-Lighting, but I'm not sure those features are worth the price difference.)Good luck!", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Entry-Level DSLR Camera!", "Author": "Irv Haas \"dvdirv\"", "ReviewID": "R2006P4D29SEZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are used to a compact point-and-shoot and want to overcome the shortcomings of these cameras, then consider the Nikon D60.This camera is designed for newcomers to DSLRs and Nikon wants you to feel at home with this camera.

Only other negative is that with more and more cameras raising the bar with mega-pixels, one wonders why Nikon couldn't have gone to a 12MP resolution in the D60.

The other option from Nikon is the D80, which answers all of my criticisms; however, many first time SLR owners will probably like the added feeling of comfort from the D60's self-cleaning image sensor which is one feature that the D80 lacks.

Consider this is 2011, you can easily get a used (excellent or like new condition) D60 through many websites for less than 400 or even 350 bucks (with kit lens, of course) and it isn't a big price gap between D40 anymore. So I don't really see anything worth arguing about it. Of course, with $400, you can also get great used D80, d200(professional), canon XSI, T1i, d3000, pentax k-x, k20d, k100d, etc. So... do more research before you buying because you have a lot of great choices.suggestions if you have a D60:D-lighting: turn it off, it delays the viewing of your shot for 2-3 seconds, and the result of using D-light is not significant, just do the edit in photoshop.manual focus: if you love manual focus, go to menu settings and turn on rangefinder, it enables a bar graph inside the viewfinder, which calculates the focus distance, great help.quick accessing the setting: simply press the magnify button (left bottom corner)to quickly adjust WD, iso, EV, etc on the LDC screen. (sounds newbie but someone may not know).My thought:I like it and I hate it!I like it because it produces great image quality, easy to use, light weight to carry, very fast.I hate it because I have so limited choice of lens! (I am on a tight budget) The only cheap af-s are 55-200mm VR(telescope, I had it and love it) and 35mm f/1.8(out of stocks everywhere, a hard-to-get lens), or the sigma 70-300 HSM(even longer telescope). Other than these, you will easily find yourself lacking choice of lenses below price of $300.I also hate it because it doesn't offer me a exposure bracketing function, which is important to HDR effect (I am a HDR lover). Anyways, I can also achieve it by using tripod and taking a little bit more time.recommendation:For first time dslr user, for casual walk around photography.If you already owned another entry level and you buy the D60, you will find yourself wanting to upgrade to another dslr very soon.Get a mid level dslr if you already owned an entry level, something like the D90.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Could not wait any longer", "Author": "jhw hendriks \"readalot\"", "ReviewID": "RQB7GDXCCT2PW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a nikon fan and user for more than 30 years, at last I bought a digital slr.

Having had a D-70s in the past, I found that the \"learning curve\" with the D-60 is not nearly as steep as some might make you believe.While considered a mid-level \"pro-am\" camera, the D-60 takes remarkably clear shots and has the added advantage of allowing the use of almost any Nikon lens available, be it 25 years old or 2.5 months old. After having trailed Canon for a while in the \"self-cleaning sensor\" department, the D-60 shows Nikon has finally adopted this feature. All I can say is, \"It's about time\". At last, I no longer have to take my camera in for its annual \"sensor scrub\". Halleluah!The D-60 has 2.5MP less resolution than the new D-5000. I started to get one of those, but couldn't see paying an extra [...] bucks for a lousy 2.5MP resolution gain.

You can also switch a photo from color to B&W;, Sepia or Cyanotype all inside the camera (though it DOES keep the original color shot when it creates the new \"color edited\" picture).The only \"complaint\" (if you can really call it that) is that the D-60 still does not have the \"Full Frame Sensor\". Instead of WYSIWYG, you get 92% of what you see in the viewfinder. While this is not a major issue as long as you're aware of it, it would have been nice to see Nikon upgrade the D-60 with the same FFS it has in some of its higher end digital SLR's.For the price, I can't beat what I have with a stick!

I have decided to use it much like my old auto 35mm SLRs in Shutter Priority mode most of the time.  I now should know enough to take some decent pics if something important comes up, say a wedding or something.  It will be some time before I feel I am using all this camera has to offer. The shutter is super quick, again just like a 35mm film camera, no delay.  I need to try some action shots now to verify this but at 3 frames a second it should be great.As much as I like it this camera is not for everybody, sure you can put it in auto and use it like a point and shoot but if that is all you want save a few hundred and buy a point and shoot.  It is also missing two features that some people would like.  The 2.5\" screen shows you the picture after you take it but can not be used to take pictures, you have to use the viewfinder.  I assume this is to save battery power, or maybe they figure real photographers would use the viewfinder anyway.  With an SLR you do get exactly what you see in the viewfinder on the picture, plus there is all the other info you would need there, shutter speed, aperture, focus point etc etc.  The other feature casual picture takers would miss is the capability to take movies.  You can use the continuous mode at 3 frames per second and then you can stitch them together into a MPEG right on the camera.  But again this camera is aimed at the serious photographer and if you are serious about movies you would use a video camera anyway.Bottom line for me anyway, this camera has everything I loved about my 35mm SLRs, without any of the drawbacks, it is way lighter, cheap to use, (no film), fully adjustable for every exposure criteria, (f-stop, shutter speed, lighting color, white balance, etc. etc), plus I get the instant gratification of digital photography.  I can't wait to take some great photos and blow them up as I used to with film.  I highly recommend to anyone who wants a good quality, reasonably priced camera.  Now I need to pick-up the 70 to 200 zoom lens and remote control, there's this humming bird on the feeder that I would love to capture of \"film\".", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "R.

I'll definitely be able to grow with this camera.  The build quality is excellent and it feels just right in my hands.  The pics it takes are amazing.  I tried the D40 at a local store and compared the pics to this one before buying as I've read that the d40 has better pic quality due to the lower mpegs (sounds a bit odd I know), but I couldn't tell the difference.  I'm sure to a more trained eye, maybe the difference is more pronounced, but for me, the d60 pic quality is more than sufficient.  Plus, I know some have said the AF is slower on the d60 and that the VR feature is not worth the extra $, but I disagree.  The AF is bit slower from what I could tell, but not so noticable that it became a problem.  Also, I purposely shook both cameras while taking some shots to see how well the VR works and it works really well.  The d40 image obviously came out blurry (due to not having any auto stabilization), but the d60 one was as if I was holding still.All in all, I'm very glad I bought the d60 and as long as the camera holds up, it will be with me for a long time. Besides, the Amazon price for the normal VR kit version is very reasonable now so the $ difference isn't as much as it was when the d60 first came out.One thing to note, I've found that though the kit 18-55mm lens is fine for indoor use or close-ups, at least a 55-200mm lense will become a necessity if you do a lot of outdoor shooting, especially of things that are far away, so I'd recommend getting a bundle that comes with both the kit lens (18-55mm VR) as well as the 55-200mm VR lens.

The image captures are extremely high quality. The settings and functions are, as Nikon says, \"amazingly simple and intuitive.\" I do a lot of landscape photography and that particular setting works extremely well. Exposure is typically perfect in AF setting mode. Very rarely do I end up with an under- or over-exposed image. That helps a lot and says much about the quality of the camera. But even when I have had the odd over or under, the auto color correct function in Photoshop generally handles any issue I experienced. After shooting with other (cheaper) digital cameras prior to getting the D60 I got used to looking through at the LCD display to frame photos. It took a few sessions to reorient actually looking through a viewfinder again. But, you know, I actually enjoy it more than framing in the display. I have fairly large hands but the grip on the D60 body is great, no issues at all. I also have a Targus battery grip for when I will be shooting all day, as it holds 2 batteries, but for general use, I do not utilize the battery grip. My one battery charge clicks hundreds of images. The available accessories seem endless. And, of course, I got many of them. Some I decided I was not really going to utilize so re-sold them.

It's light weight and I get some great pictures with it.  The kit lens is VR (this may be the biggest upgrade from the D40x) which lets me do handheld shots as slow as 1/3 second.  Color is fantastic (but watch the white balance!), meter is excellent, AF is fast.  Up to ISO 400 image quality is excellent, it's still very good at 800 and at 1600+ the noise bothers me.  When I want very noise free shots I use a tripod and ISO 100.Get this camera if:-You're on a budget-You want something for general use-You intend to mostly use the included lensDon't get this camera if:-You want to use Nikon lenses that are not AF-S (or AF-I).  Other AF lenses will not autofocus.  Non-AF lenses will not let you use the meter.-You shoot a lot of sports and other things requiring rapid fire.  This camera gets 3 FPS and then pauses after a few shots while storing images to the card.  There are more expensive cameras with larger memory buffers that will take more shots before making you wait.This camera is DX format, meaning that the 18-55 lens is like a 27-90 on a film camera.  Focal lengths are multiplied by 1.5.  So if you have a wide angle lens that you need to use as a wide angle lens, either spend a whole lot on an FX camera (D3 or D700) or just do what I do and shoot it on a film camera.Needing to use AF-S lenses to get autofocusing is a drawback - AF-S lenses are really good, but there are several useful lenses that are not available in AF-S, and AF-S can increase the lens price.  Personally I don't mind manual focusing so I can use the inexpensive 50mm/1.8 Nikkor, but if I wanted that in AF-S it would have cost 3x or 4x as much.

What lured me away from Olympus to the Nikon DX DSLR system was the simultaneous introduction earlier this year of the now widely acclaimed 16-85mm VR zoom lens and  the D60 DSLR, which has a built-in dust reduction system. IMO, the IQ of the D60, when used in RAW capture mode with the 16-85mm zoom lens, is a notch above that of the Olympus E-410 (equipped with the ZD 14-54mm zoom lens), which I owned for several months (and before that the E-1 and E-330). The D60 wins hands-down in the noise department, even at low ISO settings, and beats the pants off the E-410 at higher ISOs. The same is true for dynamic range. It's not that the E-410 has poor dynamic range, becuase it doesn't. Rather, the D60 has such unbelievable dynamic range that, compared side-by-side, it makes the dynamic range of the E-410 look weak by comparison.Bottom line: With the exception of a few missing features noted below, the D60 has nearly everything I could ask for in a compact DSLR and is nearly perfect when combined with the spectacular 16-85mm VR zoom lens.Features missing or lacking in the D60, include:* no exposure or white balance bracketing* only 3 focus points (not really a problem for me personally)* no live view feature (I bet this feature will be included in the D60 upgrade)* menu navigation system is much clunkier than the one used by Olympus consumer DSLRsRegarding the 18-55mm VR D60 kit lens, it's actually quite decent.

Another plus of this camera is the fact that it has the sensor cleaning, which if you own 4 lens like I do, comes in very handy, to keep your pictures \"dust free\". It is also nice to know, it cleans the sensor everytime you turn it on and off. It also features an orientation sensative LCD screen, which if you rotate the camera, the screen rotates as well.However, Nikon could have made more autofocus points (9 + would have been fine). They also could have added the shaft to the lens mount, to autofocus AF lenses.I would definately recommend this camera to others for its simplicity of use. It has intuitive LCD menus, easy to navigate through, and perfect for the beginning DSLR user!*Please do not base your purchase off of this sole review, as some of the above info may be slightly off. :)", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Makes you wonder why get a more expensive camera", "Author": "Guillermo Perez", "ReviewID": "R1YNNMKJWGJS86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera early this month.After having lots of digital cameras since 2001, and having tried the NEW \"entry\" digital SLRs such as the new EOS Digital Rebels, the new Lumix G1, Olympus and Sony models, I have to say this camera is a more complete prodcut for photography.The cons first, and there are few, most notceable you need motorized lenses for A/F, so if you have some vintage Nikkor optics lying around beware of that... but in all honesty, someone with that sort of gear, will be looking at other cameras, after all a 600 Nikkor tele will set you, what?, the cost of 20 of these cameras? ha, ha, ha... and that some of the white balance settings need some careful handling... that's it.Now the PROSAn aspect OFTEN OVERLOOKED GREAT ergonomics... some cameras in paper deliver a lot, but only from experience and real knowhow can a design provide a photographer with that instant feel so you can concentrate on the shot and not fidgeting around the menu settings.And MotT IMPORTANT, is that this is VERY VERY consistent product ANY ISO setting, ANY light level, any shooting program, be it auto, manual or programmed, you can use with the peace of mind that it will deliver great image quality...Write speed is very, very good, burst mode is good...

The camera has a lot going on but you don't have to be a photography genius to get awesome pictures.

Menus..Hunting through the them can be time consuming unless you read the manual and have a photography background a lot of it is confusing.2. Focusing is sometimes challenging and at times it took a minute for the camera to auto-focus.3. No grip and the shape of the camera isn't as natural feeling in the hand as it could be.4.

It has been a solid and relatively inexpensive learning tool which has allowed me to develop my knowledge of photography over the years. When combined with decent glass it allows the user to create images most beginning to intermediate photographers would be happy to display. The supplied kit lens (18-55 VR) is capable of handling most general photography duties the beginning photographer would ask of it. The VR works well on the lens and the lightweight 18-55 is a nice match to the D60 body.I have added three items which have proven to be excellent additions to the D60:Nikon 50mm 1.4GNikon 70-300 VRNikon SB-600The addition of these two lenses and the flash have greatly increased the image quality and capabilities of the little camera. The lenses are my go-to glass for portraits and other subjects where high image quality is essential. The flash has opened up a new realm of photographic possibilities over the pop-up flash on the D60.There are always negatives with any camera and with a beginner's camera such as the Nikon D60 there are a few:1) If you want to change settings, you are going to be digging in the menu.2) Three focus points means you will be working hard to properly compose your shots.3) You don't want to reach beyond ISO 400 if you want to maintain any type of image quality.4) The physical size of the camera makes handling a bit difficult at times.5) Lack of a Nikon battery grip with controls for shooting in portrait mode.There are quite a few positives to the D60:1) The size of the camera makes it easy to haul around all day (you don't end up with great pictures if you leave your camera at home).2) It served as an inexpensive entry into the world of DSLRs.3) The image quality is actually quite good (when combined with good glass it is capable of creating really nice results).4) It handles flash units the size of the Nikon SB-600 well.5) The Active D Lighting works really well.6) There are a lot of options available in the menu to modify your images.7) The in camera sensor cleaner works well - no dust issues in five years of use.8) It provides for RAW, JPG, or RAW+JPG options.9) It has a variety of \"scene modes\" which can be useful for a beginner prior to switching to S,A, or M as your experience grows.Overall I am quite pleased with my purchase as it has served me well for a long time considering it is a simple beginner's DSLR. I have outgrown its capabilities and will be moving to either the Nikon D600 or D800, but as a starter setup the D60 has proven to be a capable companion for my photographic studies.

Voss \"Russ\"", "ReviewID": "R3VVWQG71G6NLX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was my college graduation present, and I love it. There are a few draw-backs to it, but overall it's done a fantastic job and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to get into photography.The picture quality is excellent, and if you shoot in the RAW format you'll have a lot of flexibility with the finished image. This also leads to my first gripe about the camera: It wasn't made for serious shooters of RAW. The processing power can only take a burst of three RAW images before it locks up to process and store them all. You can't shoot for a few seconds. Depending on what you're shooting, this can cause you to miss quite a bit if you're heavy-handed on the shutter. If you shoot JPG, or release the shutter sparingly, this isn't an issue.The kit lens is solid and reliable, for basic shooting it's fantastic. You might consider augmenting it with a 55-200mm lens for longer-distances, but the 18-55mm lens that comes with the camera is great for day-to-day.The interface just works, which sounds funny, but I consider it a high compliment. After my initial setup of the camera, I rarely had to go deep into the menu for anything and the exposure controls were simple and intuitive.The only real complaint I have about the camera is the function of the light meter in low light situations. The light meter has a tendency to focus on one really bright thing or one really dark thing, resulting in low-light pictures getting way under or way over exposed. One can bypass this pretty easily by taking a series of shots at varying exposures, but it'd be nice if the light meter was a little less picky.One minor nitpick I have is this camera is rather small, and anyone with big hands, as I have may find is slightly uncomfortable. Adding a battery grip (I went with an Opteka) is a good investment, both for comfort and for added battery life.All in all, a good camera for someone starting out in photography who wants to work with something more substantial and flexible than a point-and-shoot. Anyone looking to do more professional work, however, should look at higher end models.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buy it, use it and move on up", "Author": "Wray Post", "ReviewID": "R3U8VUP96RRLLW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the D60 for appx. 2 years now. Though I had used a 35 for many years, when the digital cameras first came out I knew that was the direction I wanted to go. I started with many point and shoot cameras and still have a small Nikon S4. But as a person matures as a photog, a longing for more advanced cameras and gear rears its ugly head. So I got the D60 because it is a relatively inexpensive Nikon DSLR. The main features that you should consider about the D60 is that it is a DX camera, meaning that the sensor that records the shot is smaller then a FX or full frame sensor (FX is the same size as a 35mm film camera). Why is it important to know this? By buying a DX camera you are committing yourself to investing in DX lenses. And you will want more lenses ;-) As of today, I have the kit 18-55mm, a 55-200mm (both are Nikons) and a Tamron 70-300 with Macro. I have also made my own pin hole lens that fits on the D60. If you become an avid photog, you will end up with more money invested in lenses then in camera bodies. What else to consider? Well, the D60 can take you from being a snapshooter to a seasoned amature photog. When you first get the camera, set it up on jpg format and AUTO. By using jpg you save space on your SD card so that you can take more shots and by using AUTO, the camera is as easy using a point and shoot camera. Have fun, work on your composition and lighting skills. And then move on up to shooting in RAW which saves the shot that the camera actually records without comprising the shot. By using RAW you will have more advantages of how you process the final pic. Also you will want to use other settings then AUTO as you learn about your camera and your new craft. The Manual setting is where you will probably want to end up most of the time for the simple reason that it gives you more options of how your D60 records that image. You will eventually stop taking pictures and start making pictures. And that is probably is the strongest reason for buying the D60, it will help you grow as a photographer.My major caveat about buying this camera is that if you do use it and do grow into a budding advanced shooter, you will start looking at bigger and lot more expensive gear. So you have a choice, buy the D60 and expect to be wanting something newer and better in a couple of years, or tuck your tail and run away as fast as you can. After all, that little $100 point and shoot camera will work for ya, won't it?

I bought it on ebay as a packaged deal with 2 lenses, and gobs of other little things. (I would not recommend buying it as package bundle, unless you know the smaller items are good quality).10.2 megapixels is a good trade for the price. I never had an issue with blowing up my images or printing with professional printers.A function I love with Nikon cameras is the \"no-flash\" setting. It's been a lifesaver when I don't want to use a flash but I want the camera to automatically use the best settings for a low light situation without the flash. The on-camera flash is another plus. My high end camera doesn't have one and it can be frustrating using a bulky off-camera flash all the time.I used the Nikon D60 rigorously for over a year with everything from coursework (I am a photography student) to fun gatherings. It's portable compared to the Canon 5D Mark II, which I also own. I use the Nikon D60 for occasions when I don't have time to worry about the thousands of dollars in my other camera (i.e. apartment hunting, traveling, and daily snapshots). I also frequently use the Nikon as a backup if my other camera's battery dies.Nikon vs. Canon debate: Since using both, I don't believe that one brand is \"better\" than the other, but I do feel that each has a different feel and look. I first wanted a Nikon because I liked the way it functioned and I was falsely told that Nikon takes sharper images. I've heard that Canon lenses have been around longer, and generally are better made because of that.Bottom Line: The Nikon D60 is a great camera for the price.

I got this camera as an upgrade from my Canon S2 IS which offered a lot of functionality over a typical compact digital camera but not as much as I wanted.  The D60 gives me the same creative freedom that I once enjoyed from my old 1990's Canon T60 SLR (told you I was novice!).If you are purchasing this camera as an upgrade from a point and shoot, I suggest shooting in Manual mode, aperture priority, or shutter priority once you familiarize yourself with the controls.  Shooting in one of these three modes can really give you great results.My only gripe is the focus ring on the 18mm-55mm kit lens.  It's way too small.  When I've switched to manual focus, it just feels weird having such a small area to grip.  Maybe that's typical for autofocus lenses, I don't know.  My only other SLR experience did not have autofocus.One last tip: turn off the auto review option!

It was hard to spend this much money on a camera for me, but we were going on a two week vacation to Italy and I couldn't get myself to go without one considering we knew how beautiful and colorful our adventures would be.  After hours and hours of research I discovered this camera was the best value for a beginner.  Over and over I read reviews from pundits and beginners like myself express their happiness.  I can't give a critical review as others considering I am still learning about this camera, but I have to say it is a huge step up from a point and shoot (duh).  The quality is awesome and the options are endless.  It was not too heavy considering I was walking hours a day with it on my neck and it hardly bothered me.  When we got home and were ready to transfer all of our pics to the comp. it was as easy as hooking it up and waiting.  The battery life was very good.  I'm very satisfied and look forward to becoming more knowledgeable about it's manual settings so that I can get the full potential out of this baby.  A few notes for readers who might be buying an SLR for the first time like myself:  1)The learning curve on how to use the custom settings would probably require many hours, but you can get some great shots on the Programmed setting and default settings in the mean time.  2)I found out while we were on our trip that that this lens doesn't zoom in much and lens can cost $200+, but overall this lens gets the job done.  3)Nikon seemed to be a lot better value than Canon's cameras, which to me was their biggest competitor.  Canon's entry level cameras were much more expensive.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not perfect, but a good camera", "Author": "Marissa", "ReviewID": "R1DH3L9315R1TR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned the D60 since November 2008 and for the most part have been pleased with my purchase. I have been able to improve my photography skills considerably with this camera's more advanced functions, but was also able to take amazing pictures right out of the box on the automatic settings. I am still learning about all that this camera is capable of and I've enjoyed owning it, with a few minor exceptions.Things I don't like about this camera are:- Only 3 auto-focus points- Having to dig into the menu to change nearly every funtion (although there are a few buttons that you can designate which function you'd like them to control)- No Bracketing- Closure over SD card area flips open easily, usually when I'm not meaning to open it.I hadn't had a problem until last weekend when all of a sudden all my pictures were coming out blurry despite all my efforts to combat the problem. I ended up taking it in to the store I bought it from (Ritz Camera) and they told me that my lens was defective. It wasn't always defective and I've never dropped my camera, so I don't know what caused this, but I was pleased that the lens had a 5 year warranty and they just swapped out a new one for me. The new lens has worked well for the past few days, but I'm disappointed in the lack of durability of the first lens.The D60s in-camera editing is a nice feature that was one of the selling points for me. But honestly, I rarely use it and now wish that I wasn't so hung up on it to begin with. I do everything I need to do in Photoshop and hardly ever touch the editing menu. I think if I were buying my first SLR all over again I'd probably go with either the Canon XS or spring for the D90 instead. The XS doesn't have the extensive in-camera editing features that the D60 has, but judging from the way I use my camera I think I would've been happier with the Canon instead (at least at the entry level SLR): more autofocus points, less digging through menus to change functions, bracketing, live view (if that's important to you), etc. It just has more of the features that I want, but being new to digital SLRs, I didn't know that I wanted them until 8 months after I purchased my D60. The D90 has all these features too but it's more than I was prepared to spend at the time.Having said this, I do enjoy my D60. It is a very nice camera and I'm learning to work well with it. It is easy to learn on and easy to use. My gripes are mainly just small nuisances, not anything major with the camera. The battery life lasts forever and the start-up time is nearly instantaneous. So if you're leaning toward the D60 and are just reading reviews to confirm your choice, you should be very happy with it, as I am for the most part. If, on the other hand you are torn between the D60 and the Canon XS/XSi, I'd go for the Canons or just make the jump to a D90. Not that the D60 isn't a great camera, I just don't think I was as informed a buyer as I should have been for what my photography needs are.", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for entry-level dSLR", "Author": "L. Baker \"YoungSmart1\"", "ReviewID": "RJ4BJE0V9F2M9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm just getting into photography, so this review will be quite non-technical. I think the D60 is a good camera for those just starting. The D40 would be an equally good choice, but the D60 does have more megapixels, which is good for making larger prints and for massive cropping of images. It also has the sensor cleaner, for whatever good that is worth. It has a few other minor differences from the D40, probably not making it worth the price difference between the 2 based on features alone.However, the D60 kit includes a VR version of the 18-55mm lens, whereas the D40 kit lens is not a VR lens. Most will say that one doesn't need VR at these focal lengths, which is mostly true except that for someone just starting out, my hand is pretty shaky and when shooting at the 55mm end and/or in low light conditions where faster shutter speed might be hard to come by, I personally feel like the VR is helpful.So to me, the few different features AND the VR lens make the D60 a worthwhile purchase in my opinion. If money is an issue, get the D40 and don't look back, because the practical differences are minor, but if you can swing the extra for the D60, I think it is worth it.I personally am in love with my D60 and with photography in general. The D60 has been a dream to learn on. It's not loaded down with features that I don't know how to use. It just has the basics, making it a good platform to learn on. The image quality from the camera is excellent. the kit lens is good for a kit lens, although you will likely want to purchase other lenses as you learn. The 55-200mm VR lens makes a great inexpensive addition for those just starting out to have decent range coverage to experiment with.In all i'm very happy with my purchase and when I'm ready to graduate to a body with more features, I just might keep my D60 around. Its a great compact camera that is a dream to travel with (as far as dSLRs go anyway). I take the camera with me all the time. Obviously its not a point & shoot to carry in my pocket, but when I know I'm going to be somewhere where I want more control then a p&s;, i am comfortable carrying my d60 because its pretty compact as far as dSLRs go.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good beginners SLR", "Author": "F.

I was almost about to buy the Canon, but when I held it it just wasn't comfortable and ergonomic. The D60 was a better fit, and since I was just getting into the dSLR world, I thought fine. At first I started with just Auto settings, but after a few months I'm only using Manual settings to snap photos. It's not hard once you wrap your head around the basics and play with the controls. Yes, you will mess up and pictures will either be white or black, but make some adjustments, snap again, and go from there. The hardest thing is being intimidated by big words and confusing definitions.. but it's better once you're in it.I first used this camera on a trip to Hawaii and really, I wouldn't have bought anything else. Once I figure out the rest of the settings on a pretty good basis, I'll get into buying different lenses.

If you actually know how to run a DSLR full manual, I would actually say go for the D40 and use the extra money for another lens.  They can both shoot RAW too. The D60 is more for the casual photographer who would like to use the presets, or full AUTO, kinda like me.  Definitely go for a Class6 SD card, as write speed is heavily dependent on the speed of your SD card.  I noticed a huge jump in speed from Class2 to Class4, and a smaller, but noticable jump from Class4 to Class6.  And with SD cards so cheap now, you'll be cheating yourself to save a few bucks by getting a slower card. You'll notice it the most if you use RAW or ever use the multi-shot setting.All in all, awesome camera for the average photographer.

The camera works fine in manual mode with old non-auto focus lenses. Exposure is set manually and for still life/scenic shots it is quite easy to shoot few test shots to dial in the exposure. The old f/2.8 macro lens produces some great color and contrast. For action shots, the almost instant focus of the new lenses and VR is hard to beat. The 18-55 sharpens up between f/8-f/11 and is quite acceptable wide open, but not really impressive. For a good telephoto, I've invested in the 70-300mm VR lens. For about $500, it's probably the last tele I'll need, and will work with full frame sensors.For those new to the D60, I'd recommend a -1/3 exposure compensation in bright outdoor conditions until you get the hang of setting the exposure. Also, if shooting indoors, learn to set the white balance by shooting a white card or wall as reference. Indoor lighting varies widely these days with so many light sources available. And shoot and review in a variety of conditions until you can access those menus and adjust your exposures without thinking.

The Camera is great.  It's very easy to use and takes excellent pictures.  I only have one complaint about the camera.  The sensor that turns off the LCD screen when you put your face up to the viewfinder is WAY to sensitive.  If you happen to be in a certain kind of light, for instance under a tree where the sun/shade is sporadic, the screen will get confused and blink on and off repeatedly.  Check the forums and you'll see it's a common problem with the D60.  When it starts to do this, it's best to just turn the Auto off function off until you are in better light.  I think it's just a shoddy design flaw.  It's not a huge deal, it's just when you dump a few hundred dollars on something, you expect it to work flawlessly.  No such luck.  Other than that, it's a great camera.Now a word about the seller.  Take from this what you will.  I bought my D60 here on Amazon from Cameta Camera.  They supposedly sell a Nikon Factory Refurbished D60.  That is NOT true.  I don't know hoe they get away with such false advertising.  When I purchased the product, I was sent an invoice that said \"Nikon D60 Factory Demo\".  These are cameras that have been used for advertising purposes in stores, trade shows, etc.  That is not what I ordered or wanted.  I immediately called Cameta and spoke to a very friendly customer service representative who assured me that the camera I ordered was indeed a Factory Refurbished product and that the invoice was simply wrong.  She even said that the invoice said Factory Demo because they were having a problem with their software.  That was a lie.  Later, when I was having problems with the LCD screen, I spoke to their technical support representative, who shed light on their products.  He said that when they are listing an item, Amazon does not have an option for \"Factory Demo\" and so they have to select \"Refurbished\".  When I expressed my disappointment, the Representative actually said, \"If it will make you feel better if I tell you it's refurbished, I'll tell you it's refurbished.\"  Pretty shocking.  So, a word to the wise.  If you want a Factory Refurbished D60, do not order it from Cameta.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "nemepoznavash \"LoveToCreate\"", "ReviewID": "RYVQ329E7TTY9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is really nothing to say about Nikon.

The original D40 was a hugely important camera for Nikon and can be given a lot of the credit for the resurgence in Nikon's fortunes at the volume end of the SLR market (which had been totally dominated by Canon since the launch of the EOS 300D / Digital Rebel). The D40's success (which continued long after the D40X made its swift appearance only 6 months later) isn't hard to explain; it was keenly priced, nicely designed and built and capable of excellent results. It was also a camera that proved cameras do not sell on megapixels alone (even at launch its 6MP resolution was far from 'class leading').The D40X, which was positioned as a premium alternative to the D40 rather than its replacement, didn't mess around with the formula much at all; a new sensor with more (ten) megapixels and a lower base ISO, plus a slightly higher continuous shooting rate. The D60 is a direct replacement for the D40X (the D40 will stay around for a while as Nikon's budget option), and once again it's not a major upgrade; the sensor remains the same (though now has a dust reduction system) and the external design is almost identical. There's a few new features, including the same Expeed processing 'concept' seen in the D3 / D300, Active D-Lighting, an eye sensor (to control the screen display), and some tweaks to the interface, but perhaps the most significant change isn't to the camera at all; the move to an optically stabilized version of the kit lens.Auto Focus only for AF-S or AF-I lensesAs with the D40 and D40X, the new D60 doesn't have an built-in focus drive motor which means it can auto focus only with lenses which have their own drive motor (AF-S and AF-I lenses). The lack of a drive motor can be seen by the missing mechanical focus drive pin on the lens mount (see images below). One of the D60's new features is an electronic rangefinder to help manual focus on non AF-S / AF-I lenses.Nikon D60 key features  * 10 megapixel DX format CCD (1.5x FOV crop)  * Nikon EXPEED processing 'concept' (as per D300, D3)  * 3D Color Matrix Metering II, 420 pixel sensor  * Multi-CAM530 three area AF sensor  * New Image sensor cleaning system  * Eye sensor (turns off LCD display)  * ISO sensitivity range 100 - 1600 plus HI 1 (3200 equiv.)  * 3.0 fps continuous shooting*, unlimited in JPEG  * No status LCD, LCD monitor based status / settings screens (now rotates)  * Help suggestions on LCD monitor (eg. scene too dark, try using flash)  * Large 2.5\" 230,000 pixel LCD monitor  * Short shutter lag and viewfinder blackout  * Support for SDHC (SD cards over 2 GB in capacity)  * In-camera retouching  o Quick Retouch  o D-Lighting (shadow / highlight enhancement)  o Red-eye reduction  o Trimming  o Monochrome  o Filter effects  o Small picture  o Image overlay  o Raw processing  o Stop-motion movie  * USB 2.0 with PTP and Mass Storage device support  * Very compact, light body  * Improved menu user interface  * EN-EL9 Lithium-Ion battery (7.2V, 1000 mAh)  * New stabilized AF-S DX 18-55 mm kit lensDifferences compared to the D40X  * EXPEED processing  * Image sensor cleaning system with Airflow control system  * Automatically rotating user interface (for using camera vertically orientated)  * Stop motion movie function  * New stabilized kit lens (AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR)  * Eye sensor  * Electronic 'rangefinder' for manual focus  * Active D-Lighting with dedicated button  * In-camera Raw processing  * New JPEG retouch effects (Cross Star and Color Intensifier)* Slower with noise reduction enabledReview notesBecause of the similarities between the two, parts of the first half of this review are taken from the D40X review.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Family camera", "Author": "Bethany", "ReviewID": "R2OJMALNC6WGUV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have really enjoyed this camera but I feel that it holds me back in doing anything better than just some good pictures at a birthday party.

The images are clear and crisp.Make sure to purchase an appropriate SDHC card for your usage; we purchased the 8GB SanDisk Extreme (with our settings it holds 2000 images and processes the images really quickly).  Also, make sure to at least purchase a UV filter to avoid scratching the lens (A $6 filter is a lot cheaper to replace than a $150+ lens).", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very Reasonable SLR", "Author": "J.

I dropped the camera, and the plastic (not metal) mount inside the lens broke.Remember the olden days or yore when the Nikon image was the indestructible nature of their products.  Plastic part broke.OK.  So I tried to get a replacement mount.  Went on-line, and every store I found showed the part to be out of stock.Called Nikon.  No part.  But I can ship it to them for repair.  Estimated cost $100-150.  Plus the part.  Plus shipping both ways.  I just bought a new one through Amazon for $125.It is a rip-off.  I asked the person on the phone how Nikon could repair the lens if they didn't have the part.  Seemed like a fair question.  Well, that led to a big dance-around-the-subject.  The bottom line is that of course they have the $15 part (what the price was in the stores where it was out of stock), but they don't want to sell it to me because they want the money for the repair.  It is a simple repair--three screws, and somebody even has an on-line video demonstrating it.Bottom line:  When you are out in the wilderness with cameras they can get damaged.  Fair is fair in terms of repairs.  I dropped it, not Nikon.  But to withhold the part so Nikon can charge me an outrageous amount to repair it is not fair.My advice is to try a different camera company.  I will next time.

You, like me, may be sorely disappointed. I used a Nikon D50 for years (it was stolen) and thought I was replacing it with an \"upgrade.\" The old D50 came with a decent if simple processing software program called Picture Project which allowed you to edit pictures (crop, tweak, etc.). THE D60 DOES NOT! No one tells you this in advance. The D60 comes with a completely inadequate program for \"viewing\" pictures but not editing them--ViewNX. It's good for nothing. When I found this out the hard way and called Nikon they told me I would have to buy their new Capture software for $179. If you are about the spend $700 on this camera, be prepared: if you want to edit your pictures on your computer (and not just on the tiny LCD screen on the camera), you'd better budget another $179.

The camera fails to freeze even the slightest motion without flash under normal room light. IT behaves better with 1/80s shutter spped at iso 1600 at normal room light (6, 65W floodlight bulbs in a 11x20 room).But at iso 1600 and shutter speed 1/80, the picture quality is not acceptable, pretty dark and grainy. Surprsingly my compact Fuji A700 does a better job in the same light (it also beat canon sd1000 compact) in the same test.I was hoping that I would get good normal light performance from a DSLR (espacially D60 with its good reviews) but I was wrong.Pros: Good auto focussing, 3 points is more than enough for a normal user. Single point is even more predictable. Good shoe to shot time and flash recycle time.Update: After 3 more months of use and reading the manual 3 more times I have concluded this is just a 2 star camera & not worth the money at all. The problem continues to be its low light sensitivity (or the lack of it). It keeps manifesting itself in different ways. Lately I have been having problems with its low light sensitivity when I use high Fstop numbers like F10-F16 indoors with flash. At those values I am forced to use ISO800 so that the picture will not be dark and even then the picture is not great. I am now convinced that Ken Rockwell was right in his review about the low light issue with the sensor in this camera... Only if I had read his review before buying mine.. Instead I went by then 4.5 star rating on this site & ended up wasting my money...In my view this camera is good only for brigthly lit outdoor conditions or just indoor potraits with flash. In those conditions a good point & shoot can do as good a job!!! If you want to use the D60 indoors with flash for groups pictures where some subjects are 4 feet behind the focus point, you will be utterly dissapointed because that require F10-F16 to preserve details of people in the background & this camera sucks indoors at F10-F16 even with flash & good living room light.Now Ken rockwell seems to think D40 is much better under such low light conditions, if Nikon would wanted to make me happy I would be more than willing to exchange this with a D40... As it is is near useless to me right now....Save your money & stay away from the D60....", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Starter D-SLR", "Author": "J.

They dropped support for AF lenses, meaning now you can only choose between really expensive AF-S lenses, or manual focusing everything with AF lenses. I have 5 lenses, and only two of them auto focus on this crippled piece of garbage, and those two are the same 18 to 55mm kit lenses, one with VR. Oh joy. But I wouldn't need VR with my 50mm AF 1.8D, but nikon doesn't support that here, other than via manual focus. Sure, you can set up the range finder to help you, but by the time you're done trying to focus, your photo op just walked away and all your pictures turned out blurry.And to change any settings on this camera is infuriating, as again, after the D50, all the buttons have no dual functionality, requiring most of your time spent fiddling with the damned menus. The D60 is a really heavy point-and-shoot camera with virtually no buttons. Look at the back of it to see how blank it looks. Not ONE button on the back of this thing will change even ONE setting. Every one of those buttons is used to tinker with the convoluted menus or thumb through pictures. If I wanted a monstrous and really expensive 2.5-inch digital picture frame, I'd get one. I got this to TAKE pictures, not look at them.Nikon has leveled the playing field. Without support for lenses or buttons, you really have to go with Canon here.If you already have AF lenses, you have to go with anything above the D40, 40X, D60, D3000, D3100, and D5000, because none of those support AF.This camera is for point-and-shoot morons who want to feel special about themselves.
