{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review by actual owner - great little snapshot camera", "Author": "Davey Williams \"davey williams\"", "ReviewID": "RGOJKJYH9BXEF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was able to get this model a little early, and was excited to try it out in - what better city to test a camera? - Paris. The last Sony snapshot camera I used was on a trip in 2007, and I was so dissatisfied with that camera that I sold it immediately after returning home. I was eager to see if Sony had improved their entry level cameras, especially the picture quality. I shall post some pictures to offer examples up in the product details, but these will be reduced in size for posting.Photo quality: My initial day out indicated that they have made dramatic improvements in both quality and speed. Photos in daylight were crisp and clear in just about every shot, and any that weren't were only because I was shooting poorly on purpose to test the photos. I was also quite happy with the quality of shots in low light and indoors, which is where I noticed the most improvement over past Sony low-end offerings. There was some blurring in darker situations, of course, but for the most part the software was able to produce images that are well balanced and low grain. The 14 megapixel feature is great - there are many photos I've been able to crop and retain quality, and photos of, say, a stone sarcophagus can be zoomed in upon when viewing images later to see very good detail.I must also mention that the camera is very good at balancing photos. It almost always produces a picture with an appropriate contrast, and only in the worst cases did the image wash out in an area. For example, a shot of Joan of Arc (the statue, not the person) in Notre Dame came out very well even with a stained glass window in the background. The stained glass was bright but distinguishable, and the detail of the stone statue was clear and well balanced. Only in extreme cases - such as a shot of a black sculpture in the Louvre with a window behind it with blaring sunlight - did the camera fail to balance the image, but these are the kind of bad photography shots one would never expect a camera to take well.Types of Photos: Like most all snapshot photos, this camera will perform best shooting still subjects with plenty of light. Moving objects didn't tend to blur, a problem I'd had with other cheap snapshot cameras, but the response time can make getting these shots difficult. Trying to capture a motorcycle passing an old church, my 7-10 attempts were mostly good photos, but getting the moving bike in the exact spot I wanted was nearly impossible.Features: Overall, this camera lacks in features, although for most uses I found it sufficient, and at the price I didn't expect a lot of extras. The 4x zoom is relatively fast and easy to use, and about right for this type of camera. I was surprised there was no optical zoom given the high megapixels, but I can live with cropping on the computer. The panorama mode is nifty but not that useful - it works quite well in creating a long image, which of course will cause distortion in most cases. To use this feature, you set the mode and clich the shutter. The camera will prompt you to move it from left to right, and then it will generate the image (which is always impossible to see on the display owing to its shape.) Here I would have liked some add'l features - there is just 'one size' for panorama shots - you must sweep all the way across or the image will fail. This creates many shots that will need to be messed with on the computer later, which is okay but annoying. I was also disappointed panorama doesn't work in an up and down orientation - you always have to sweep the camera in the same manner. You can, of course, hold it sideways to create a vertical panorama, but I really wanted some vertical shots tqking advantage of a larger width. Still, panoramas of the Tour Eiffel allowed me to create some fun, unique shots of the full height of the structure. There are not many other features - just some rudimentary quality settings, face detection, etc. Some might want to move up to a camera with more features, but I actually appreciated this in a point and shoot camera.Battery life: Here the camera could use some help. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Apple products, but digital cameras have more or less remained stuck in 2002 concerning batteries. It's annoying to have a separate charger, and battery life isn't great. Three hours of shooting...granted, constant shooting...at St Denis drained it. Given how light and small it is, I'd fully support doubling the battery size to get twice the life. I'd also love for camera makers to start to move toward USB charging options.I'd also love it if cameras would start incorporating some onboard space. It feels like the dark ages to have to buy a card. 2 - 4 gig of onboard memory with a card slot for expansion would be nice.Overall, a great, small, fun camera that's easy to grab and go. I wish Sony would re-imagine some of the ways digital cameras work, perhaps taking some cues from iPods, especially regarding batteries, but for the price this nifty unit is great.Pros: Excellent pics for camera in this price range, good color balance, good in darker spaces, a few fun featuresCons: Battery life could be better, charging options, not many features or in-camera editing options", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R3HA1CZJE3FT7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The intelligent shooting mode is great--it detects different scene types (landscape, sunny, cloudy, etc.) and auto-adjusts the exposure settings to get the best picture. Picture quality is great. It also has a movie mode that takes nice videos. The mic for the audio is a little weak but it is only a point and shoot camera, so a so-so mic is to be expected. The panorama mode is very easy to use--just point and sweep while holding the shutter--and the camera automatically stitches everything together with no overlap or missed sections. I've used panorama mode at a baseball stadium and at a lake and got great detail in both settings.The battery life could be a bit better, but it lasts for at least 8 hours of shooting. I was turning the camera off and on a lot, which had a bigger drain on the battery, I'm sure.I first used a SanDisk 4GB Memory Stick Pro Duo with this camera, and the camera would not read the card properly. I even reformatted the memory card with my computer and the camera still would not read the card. I finally purchased a SanDisk SDHC memory card that works fine. Others have had problems too with the SanDisk Memory Stick Pro Duo, so be careful with that.Pros- Intelligent mode for automatically adjusting the settings; picture quality; movie mode and panorama mode; good quality for the price.Cons- Rechargeable battery could last a bit longer; Battery is specific Sony battery that can only be charged from a wall outlet with the included charging doc; Mic is a bit weak for audio when shooting movies.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pictures but horribly slow", "Author": "L.

This was my first foray into other brands, and while the photo quality (particularly in low light situations) is fantastic, this camera has made me regret my decision to do so. For a point-and-shoot it fundamentally fails the \"point and SHOOT\" test because of the frustratingly slow focus time. The camera simply will not take a picture quickly. I can't tell you how many great shots I've lost because of this feature. I've read the manual, played with the options and experimented with different ways of taking shots (\"focusing\" early by depressing the shutter button, just hitting it once...everything!) and nothing seems to work. (I'm open to suggestions if others have noticed this)To be perfectly fair, the quality of the pictures is really great. I just wish there was a way to make it faster and, therefore, more usable.

(I live in North Carolina). The first pictures I took with the camera were really great and couldn't wait to take pictures of the wide open mountains ranges in southern Arizona. However, on the third day of my trip I noticed the LCD began to look warped. Since this was my first digital camera I'm not sure what was wrong. I continued to take pictures in Arizona just hoping there was a slight glitch with the LCD display and it would not affect the picture quality.When I got home a few weeks later I uploaded all the pictures to my computer and to my horror noticed that they all came out poorly. Many of the pictures looked as if extra light was burned into the pixels and many of the pixels would softly bleed into each other. Hey, it looks great if you're trying to create a dream-like ethereal effect but that is hardly what I was looking for. Since I was quite upset I returned to Walmart and told that I would need to contact Sony. I did so. The Sony representative told me that I would need to mail the camera to their support facility in Laredo, Texas. I did so and paid about $5.00 to have it shipped. During my first contact with Sony I was told that the camera would be fixed since it was still under warranty. However, the story didn't last too long. I was then told that the warranty would not cover the 'damage' to the camera and that I would need to pay $37.00 for the repair. Then I contacted Sony again and was told that the camera would not be fixed and that they were just going to send it back to me. When I inquired about the reason for this I was told that 'moisture' was in the camera. I mentioned that I noticed the LCD screen would often fog up all time -- after all I live in the South and gets quite humid during the summer months. The tech then told me that 'ambient moisture' from a humid environment was not covered by the warranty. So in other words, if I use this camera on a humid southern day it make distort the pixels and Sony will not fix it.When I received my camera back from Sony not only had they not fixed the camera -- no surprise -- but they didn't even return my memory card. So the few pictures that did turn out well are now lost because Sony lost -- stole, misplaced, etc -- my memory card. So basically I just paid $5.00 and all I got in return from Sony was a lost memory card.Outraged, I went by Walmart to explain the situation to them and they actually were very understanding and kind and made an ad hoc decision to honor a return, even though it was outside their fifteen day return policy. However, I will never purchase another Sony product. Sony sells cheap cameras that cannot even withstand the humid weather in the south, and if your camera 'breaks' while the warranty is in effect they will still refuse to honor the warranty! The warranty I purchased through Walmart was even worse. I contacted the company that Walmart outsources to for warranties and was also told that they would not honor the warranty and that if I wanted it fixed I should try to take it to Radio Shack! So I guess the morale of this story is that warranties are useless and Sony sells lemons.

Actually, I did too much research and wound up confused. I finally just broke down and ordered this one because it seemed like a good deal.I'm really glad I bought it. It takes great pictures and it's easy to use. I don't like to spend a lot of time figuring out technology, and the menu on this camera makes things really easy to figure out. I haven't even looked at the owner's manual since I got the camera. The panoramic feature is awesome: just set it on panoramic, hold the button down, and scan the scene from left to right.The only thing I wish this camera had was a lower MP setting. It takes pictures in four settings: VGA, 5 MP, 10 MP, and 14 MP. The 10 and 14 are very detailed and ideal for blowing up into large prints. Even the 5 MP looks good in a large size. The VGA setting is pretty poor quality, not even worthy of viewing on your computer or sending to someone via email. The solution to this is the 5 MP setting, which produces a great quality picture but is also a very large-sized file, so you can't send many pics at once. It would be great if this camera had a 2 or 3 MP setting. Not a huge deal, though.UPDATE 3/31/13: This camera still works great. The battery still holds a charge just fine (knock on wood.)

The pics without the flash or when flash is off seem to come out better than when the flash is on (or when set to automatic).

That is, if you're willing to wait for the shutter delay. It hesitates and sometimes doesn't even capture the picture. If it's dark out or you're indoors, then forget it. You'll get a bunch of blurry pictures and squiggly lines. If you do manage to take a decent picture, you'll be disappointed when you load it onto your computer. Many of my pictures comes out very soft and washed out. The battery slide cover is also in a awkward position. I find that I'll sometimes open the battery cover when I take pictures. I would steer clear of this camera.Edit 9/24:So I have taken the time to click half way, let the camera focus, and then snap pictures. However, it still hesitates and occasionally decides it doesn't want to capture a picture. I went out last night and 50% of the pictures were blurred and fuzzy. It took awful group pictures. Imagine waiting and smiling and after 5 seconds (that's a long time when people are drinking) the camera doesn't even take a picture or after the wait, the camera decides to focus on dust floating by. It's not a good feeling when people think your NEW camera is broken. I feel like I wasted my money. Even my cheap Samsung TL105 could at least take pictures in a dark club. Don't get this camera unless you plan to take pictures in good lighting. Also, the video sucks on this camera.Edit 1/11/12:I bought the Canon ELPH 300 a few months ago and in comparison, when the Cyber-Shot does take a nice picture, it is sharp and beautiful.

The last Sony snapshot camera I used was on a trip in 2007, and I was so dissatisfied with that camera that I sold it immediately after returning home. I was eager to see if Sony had improved their entry level cameras, especially the picture quality. I shall post some pictures to offer examples up in the product details, but these will be reduced in size for posting.Photo quality: My initial day out indicated that they have made dramatic improvements in both quality and speed. Photos in daylight were crisp and clear in just about every shot, and any that weren't were only because I was shooting poorly on purpose to test the photos. I was also quite happy with the quality of shots in low light and indoors, which is where I noticed the most improvement over past Sony low-end offerings. There was some blurring in darker situations, of course, but for the most part the software was able to produce images that are well balanced and low grain. The 14 megapixel feature is great - there are many photos I've been able to crop and retain quality, and photos of, say, a stone sarcophagus can be zoomed in upon when viewing images later to see very good detail.I must also mention that the camera is very good at balancing photos. It almost always produces a picture with an appropriate contrast, and only in the worst cases did the image wash out in an area. For example, a shot of Joan of Arc (the statue, not the person) in Notre Dame came out very well even with a stained glass window in the background. The stained glass was bright but distinguishable, and the detail of the stone statue was clear and well balanced. Only in extreme cases - such as a shot of a black sculpture in the Louvre with a window behind it with blaring sunlight - did the camera fail to balance the image, but these are the kind of bad photography shots one would never expect a camera to take well.Types of Photos: Like most all snapshot photos, this camera will perform best shooting still subjects with plenty of light. Moving objects didn't tend to blur, a problem I'd had with other cheap snapshot cameras, but the response time can make getting these shots difficult. Trying to capture a motorcycle passing an old church, my 7-10 attempts were mostly good photos, but getting the moving bike in the exact spot I wanted was nearly impossible.Features: Overall, this camera lacks in features, although for most uses I found it sufficient, and at the price I didn't expect a lot of extras. The 4x zoom is relatively fast and easy to use, and about right for this type of camera. I was surprised there was no optical zoom given the high megapixels, but I can live with cropping on the computer. The panorama mode is nifty but not that useful - it works quite well in creating a long image, which of course will cause distortion in most cases. To use this feature, you set the mode and clich the shutter. The camera will prompt you to move it from left to right, and then it will generate the image (which is always impossible to see on the display owing to its shape.) Here I would have liked some add'l features - there is just 'one size' for panorama shots - you must sweep all the way across or the image will fail. This creates many shots that will need to be messed with on the computer later, which is okay but annoying. I was also disappointed panorama doesn't work in an up and down orientation - you always have to sweep the camera in the same manner. You can, of course, hold it sideways to create a vertical panorama, but I really wanted some vertical shots tqking advantage of a larger width. Still, panoramas of the Tour Eiffel allowed me to create some fun, unique shots of the full height of the structure. There are not many other features - just some rudimentary quality settings, face detection, etc. Some might want to move up to a camera with more features, but I actually appreciated this in a point and shoot camera.Battery life: Here the camera could use some help. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Apple products, but digital cameras have more or less remained stuck in 2002 concerning batteries. It's annoying to have a separate charger, and battery life isn't great. Three hours of shooting...granted, constant shooting...at St Denis drained it. Given how light and small it is, I'd fully support doubling the battery size to get twice the life. I'd also love for camera makers to start to move toward USB charging options.I'd also love it if cameras would start incorporating some onboard space. It feels like the dark ages to have to buy a card. 2 - 4 gig of onboard memory with a card slot for expansion would be nice.Overall, a great, small, fun camera that's easy to grab and go. I wish Sony would re-imagine some of the ways digital cameras work, perhaps taking some cues from iPods, especially regarding batteries, but for the price this nifty unit is great.Pros: Excellent pics for camera in this price range, good color balance, good in darker spaces, a few fun featuresCons: Battery life could be better, charging options, not many features or in-camera editing options", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent point and shoot camera", "Author": "Me", "ReviewID": "R26LBT50P6SA1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a good item for you to carry to parties, trips and to take some casual pictures. Of course, you cant compare it with a professional digital camera.But, I must say that the quality of the pictures that it takes, is great. Now, it doesnt has lots of features, but that ones that it has are excellent.The face detection is very accurate. It detects faces quickly and the other features related to this one, are triggered very well.The smile detection is excelent, you can set it and it actually takes shots only if people smile. You can take your own pic with this feature, its pretty comfortable to take self-portraits with this, the same thing goes for the timer activated with the face detection.Something that I like a lot is that you can take pictures while moving or with the subject moving, and the picture will not get blury. And it also selects automatically the best scene to take the picture.In dark scenes, this camera performes very very well. You can take pictures with low light, and still get a very nice quality of picture.Now, one thing that is really nice, is that its very easy to use. These automatic features let you grab the camera and take shots without worrying about anything else.The battery life, at least for me, is pretty good. You can take lots of pics and record videos without worrying about yur battery life. Of course, dont expect to charge it only once a week. But you can be sure that it will last for the whole night or day or trip if you give it the proper charge.And well its very small and the color is very beatiful.

If you can point and shoot without shaking excessively, this is the camera for you. The picture quality comes out amazing, and the auto-detecting features of the camera are very helpful as well. Things might show up a little grainy on the LCD screen in less-than-optimal lighting but once you get it onto the computer that's where you see just how great the picture quality of this camera is. I was taking pictures with my cousin the other day and he even compared it to SLR quality pictures!Some may think that 14.1 MP is a little excessive - it is. Correct me if I'm wrong, because I heard this from a friend, but theoretically the human eye can only see the difference up to 12 MP for regular sized photos. Higher MP also takes up more space on your memory card, so if you're the type of person who never deletes pictures make sure to get a bigger SDHC card. I personally prefer the best quality pictures, whether or not my eyes can detect the difference, so I went for the highest MP on the market.It is a lot smaller than I imagined it to be. It's totally pocket-sized and very easy to carry around.Unfortunately, aside from fantastic pictures, cool features, and the cute size, this camera is lacking everywhere else. When I first picked it up I was surprised at the cheap quality of the plastic that covered it. Of course, this makes it very light and also adds to the portability of this little camera. But I'm also very afraid of dropping this thing because I'd expect it to break into pieces in its first fall. If you know you are prone to dropping things, this might not be the camera for you. Of course, this problem can be fixed by using the wrist strap provided in the packaging, and/or spending an additional $5-$10 on a camera case. But I still have to reiterate that this camera's exterior is really not made very well. The door for the AV cord (the cord that connects the camera to the computer via USB) wiggles like a loose tooth and I wouldn't be surprised if it broke off altogether within the next year. I wouldn't recommend this camera for children under 13.I agree with the other reviewers that the shutter speed for this camera is indeed, horrifyingly slow. I don't think this is the type of cameras to take to sports games or other places where there is a lot of movement and fidgeting involved. This may be the first camera I can call my own, but I know for a fact that compared to other cameras, this one very nearly crosses the line for being unreasonably slow. For my own purposes though, as a female college student who's not very interested in sports and doesn't have kids running around, I can look past this slight negative aspect.I haven't had the chance to use this camera all that much for an event or anything. So far I've only used it to test the quality of pictures, so as of now I can't really say anything about the battery life. But I don't think its that bad, really. Battery life is always something that everything can improve on.Overall, for the price of only a little over $100, you have to admit: this camera takes wonderful pictures.

She loves it but she doesn't really need anything fancy right now anyway.  This camera leaves MUCH to be desired.  I went back to my love, Canon.  Canon HS40 SX!!

I've always stayed loyal to Canon but after spending a lot of money on a camera and losing it, I decided to buy a cheaper point and shoot. That was a mistake.The camera has good features: smile detection, face detection and panoramic pictures. The quality of the pictures comes out only 20% of the time. On a recent trip, I asked someone to use the camera and she asked \"How do I make the pictures less blurry?\". Simply, you do not. You have to guess when the camera will react as one would suggest. All my pictures are blurry and the quality is not there - even when shooting on \"anti-blur\" mode. I would not buy this product again nor recommend it to a friend.

It takes good pics with a snap of the button, and not fooling around with settings all the time. Easy, Peasy!Pros:*  It's Small! Yay! Won't pull your shoulder off if you put it in  your purse.*  It's SOOOOO Easy to use. Seriously, I hate fooling with settings, and this is point & click. Period.*  Big view screen, so you can see without squinting. Clear, too. No glasses needed - Yay!.*  Huge megapixels, means you can crop oversize shots without pixelating the pic.*  Good battery life - so far. I don't take a lot of pics, but only needed to charge it a couple times.*  User friendly menu. No need to bring a book with you to figure out what all the symbols mean.***  GREAT Features:+  Has an optional grid, so you keep level.+  Has optional face detection, and smile detection, so it won't take the pic til someone smiles.+  Has optional center focal point, so if you want a bug pic, it will focus on the bug, not the flowers.+  Takes Panoramic pics with one click (& hold). No need to stitch pics together, just press the button, and spin around slowly. I did it freehand  from my chair just to test, and even with wildly different lighting and windows, it came out seamlessly, and nearly perfect. And I have shakey hands!My hubby and sons spend ridiculous money on fancy, manual adjusting cameras, and I couldn't use them. I just wanted to have a quick and easy point & click. THIS is IT.

In response to the person who complained about the icons when trying to access your photos from the computer: the icons this camera uses on the screen are stored as files in the camera, and for some reason I guess most computers want to open that folder by default (I ran into this as well.)  There is probably a way to change the default folder your computer goes to when you hook up your cable, or if you have a memory card, you can remove it and place it directly in your computer to access your images.

I know that a lot of photos look better in color, but there are some photos that look better in Black & White.Some reviewers have complained that they've had problems with this camera. I've had it for almost 3 years and haven't had one single problem with it. If I ever get a chance, I will upgrade to a newer one because every few years they make newer, better models. I probably won't upgrade for a while though. I think I'll keep this camera for at least a few more years. I'll have to try different brands to see which one I like the best. Sony's were the only ones I've ever had, but I'll have to try them out and see if there's one that I like better than a Sony.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Had one before", "Author": "Mz.

It has become my cheapo camera that I will bring out traveling when I don't want my real camera, which is too bad because it isn't exactly a cheapo price (worth it to spend an extra 20-30 dollars to get the next model up). It's also too bad because I have previously owned cyber-shots that I have loved, so I assumed this would be the same quality.I do, however, LOVE the panorama option and that seems to work pretty well.

That said, it's really not what this camera is designed for, so it isn't a real big negative.I didn't try video mode, but for quick little home videos and short videos on trips I'm confident it would be adequate.If you're looking for a simple, compact, easy to use camera that's going to give you solid picture quality, this is a a great option!", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "mariajj", "ReviewID": "R27SHVY1FBEHKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera arrived in perfect conditions and all the features described above were accomplished.

I bought a really great Sony Cybershot in 2009 but it was stolen in February 2011. I wanted to replace it for a trip to Ireland over the summer, but I did not want to a buy the same top of the line model. I went with this one and I am so glad I did.First of all, the price is really unbeatable. The number of megapixels you can get for just over $100 is incredible.I took this camera with me to Ireland for three months. It was fantastic because the battery life would last for an entire weekend filled with hiking and loads of picture taking. There is no bulky dock either, I like that I only needed a USB cord. This camera does require that battery charging be done on a wall unit. This is not ideal for a trip to Europe, but I experienced no problems when using a voltage converter, it never got too hot or lessened the battery life.If you are looking for something that won't break the bank but is really quality, I think this is a great option. I like the blue because I thought the black one looked dated. It is pretty bright, if you are conservative go with silver or black. It is really really blue.Update:About a year later, this product is still a great value. Of course, I don't think a new generation has been released, but it is gratifying that I can walk into a Target and not see a camera by the same make that is twice as good for the same price. Image quality is good for the price and with a little editing some of my photos from Ireland are print and frame quality. I also like that the item comes with a cord instead of a dock + cord like some of the other Cybershots. This is ideal for traveling, it packs up much lighter and you can import photos without a hard, flat surface (say from your bed in a hostel).

In the DSC-W80 it was not more than a second,  so I definitely felt the delay.  Perhaps those who have not experienced faster performance would not be quite as disappointed. I tried taking shots at various settings and programs,  and the lag occurred in every instance.The pictures came out fine,  but tend to be grainy when I try to zoom in onto details - and this happened with every resolution setting from VGA up to 14MP.  Fortunately,  I do not need that feature often,  so I did not consider it as a major problem;  others may tend to disagree.All told,  I do not think that the W530 is any great improvement over the old W80,  but as I continue to use it,  I guess I will learn to live with it - I am a casual amateur photographer, after all.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Good Camera", "Author": "Maria Martinez", "ReviewID": "R21X7L26T9GZ4U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good camera, delivery was on time. 100% Recommended.I was hoping that the camera had more options regarding the types of photos and backgrounds, but overall is very good.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Icons", "Author": "Barbara F.

To turn it on or take a photo, I have to press buttons hard with my fingernail. The 3-second recycling time per shot seems a bit long. Take a photo .... wait.  Take a photo ... wait.Forget the 14+ megapixels. That means nothing when the lens and the processor are cheap. Carl Zeiss lens? Who cares! A gazillion photo-taking features? Why bother! The Cybershot's photos lack detail and are quite poor in quality. As a matter of fact, they look like they've been doctored with the smart blur feature in Photoshop. Everything has that slick model clay look. What is the value of being able to make a 13\" x 9\" print that looks like total crap?I also own a 5-year-old Canon Powershot (5 megapixels) that takes better photos. I've made small art prints with it. In fact, my parents bought a 7 megapixel GE digital camera from Walgreens a few years ago for $85, and it takes better photos. Heck, I'd bet I can get crisper (though smaller) photos from my cheap iPod camera.This is a kid's camera, nothing more. If this were $40, I'd forgive a lot of its flaws.

If that's the case, my remarks will seem bizarre and a trifle crotchety (Well, I'm entitled, I'm old enough). Anyway, to me, \"Easy-To-Use\"  doesn't mean that in order to take your own picture, or to turn the Flash ON or OFF, you have to struggle and puzzle your way through a series of Menus and Screens. No, it means that if you want to take your own picture you move the SELF-TIMER button or lever, and if you want the FLASH On or Off, you do the same thing. So, although this might be \"Easy-to-Use\" for the current generation of cameras, it is unacceptably difficult to use by my standards.

I had very bad luck with Sony reliability a decade or so back; one Trinitron TV I bought died after 91 days - one day after the warranty ran out. Our Sony camcorder went in for repair every few months for years, until the extended warranty ran out. Even though we didn't pay to fix it, we missed a lot of memories while it was being repaired. After that, I swore no more Sony products.But my daughter really wanted this, and the reviews seemed OK, so I gave it a chance. It seemed OK until she lost the computer cable needed to download photographs. That's when I remembered the other reason I avoid Sony: The memory card is a weirdo format only made by Sony - it doesn't fit any of the standard card readers we have, either at home or at work. Same with the cable - Sony could have used an ordinary USB, but instead they put a non-standard Sony-only connector on the camera. Bottom line is that to get my daughters pictures I have to pay Sony a ridiculous price for a specialty item that is useless except for this camera. This time I swear: No more Sony for me.Too bad, because the camera is OK otherwise. It takes good pictures, is easy to use, and still works fine after 6 months.Update: I actually found a card reader at my local drugstore for $20 which read the Sony's goof-ball memory card. My daughter got her pictures, and I only wasted $20 and several hours of my time. I still wish Sony should use standard connectors and parts rather than trying to lock us in to their own non-standard designs, but except for that my daughter likes the camera; so I upped my rating to 3 stars. However for my next camera I'm going back to Canon - they make solid, standards-based cameras, even if they don't make a pink one; and every canon I ever bought still works - some (like my 35mm SLR film camera) over 20 years later. But if you never lose cables, don't want to swap or read memory cards, and really like Pink, then this Sony might be OK for you.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect choice!", "Author": "joannothing", "ReviewID": "R11PNQMGYGW7RU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you need speed and high quality pics this is all that you need!

I had previously owned a similar Sony CyberShot camera and had a lens issue and was so excited to have a new one.Until about 6 months later i went out of town to visit one of my best friends and the screen went completely white! i couldn't see what i was shooting at all or any of the pictures i had taken. Eventually, it began to flash from white to the actual picture giving me the opportunity to fix it. I went online to try to find instructions for the problem, which i found, only to have them not work. On top of that i found the shooting was very slow and my photos would turn up with a yellow tint  (which i thought might be the white balance, but was not).

It even has the Carl Zeiss lens.  It is a low priced camera so I guess you get what you pay for.  The battery door/sd card door  feels like it will fall off with a high wind gust.  The camera feels cheap.  Disposable cameras feel like they are built better.  The shutter lag really does lag.  For shooting indoors like at a restaurant with my family, it  was embarrassing.  The waiter attempted to take a shot and he held down the shutter for about 3 seconds, then a series of three flashes went off for around 3 seconds.  By the time it actually took the photo (after the 3rd flash) the waiter was moving his hand and the photo was blurry.  I'm not too sure on how long the battery life is cause I returned it for an upgrade.  For the price, it is a camera, and it does take photos, but my 3 megapixel camera from 2004 works better.  Oh, the panorama seemed to work fine from the one time I tested it, but the \"smile activated\" shutter feature doesn't really work.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "It already broke!!!
