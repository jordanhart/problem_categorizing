{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OUTSTANDING compact for the price -- with POWERFUL zoom!", "Author": "Fly1964 \"Phil\"", "ReviewID": "R2HFQB5WX4R0E0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did NOT buy the Samsung PL210 on Amazon, but rather Best Buy. I bought it to take to an outdoor music festival. I go to these every Memorial Day weekend and I love shooting photos of the bands. Previously I would bring my trusty Minolta Maxxum 5000 with a zoom lens for some awesome \"rock shots\".Two things have happened lately to put a damper on that fun: 1) whereas previously I was able to stand right at the foot of the stage, in recent years the concert promoters have hit on the idea of placing a VIP seating area in front of the stage and charge for up-font seating at what is supposed to be a 'free' event. 2) Security staff have become more & more oppressive about using \"professional cameras with detachable lenses\".That said, I went shopping for a compact, reasonably priced digital camera with the best zoom rating for the money. The Samsung was the ONLY one of the 20 or so compact cameras with a 10x optical zoom, the rest being between 3x to 5x. The price was right too... around $150 on sale.After familiarizing myself briefly with the manual, I took it out to the show. My usual 'spot' about 50-60 ft from the stage and dead center.The 10X optical zoom is great, but the camera ALSO has a 20x \"Intelli Zoom\" which practically brought me right up to the front of the stage again. After looking at the photos on my computer later, It looked like there was no appreciable loss of quality (or graininess) in the photos. I have not yet used the advertized (\"up tp 50x digital zoom feature yet).I shot most of the day using the camera's automatic setting where it selects the best setting for the situation. I also had the photo size set to \"5m - 2592x1944\", and the quality set to \"fine\". With the 2 Gig memory card I was using, I tiil about 350 photos and the card was only about 1/4 full. From what I could see from the LCD display, I was getting come incredible shots. As I said previously, looking at them on the computer bore this out.Later in the day, I noticed that as the daylight faded, it became harder to take clearly focused pictures without motion blurring. I took the camera off the automatic setting and switched to \"manual\" mode which basically turns off the auto flash (flashes when camera deems necessary), and the 'smart' focus and just gave me a non-flash camera with a single focusing reticle in the viewfinder. I did not touch any of the other settings that day (ISO speed, shutter speed, motion stabilization, etc...). In this configuration, I found I was able to get some clearer photos in the lower light (late afternoon, overcast).Once the sun set and only the stage lights providing illumination, all bets were off. I had not read enough on the camera's operation to set it for night shots, although I believe if I had I would have had great success. As it was, only the wide angle shots were really any good. When I tried to zoom in (in either auto or 'factory default' manual) the motion blur was just too much to give clarity. Again, this is not the fault of the camera... just the operator who needs to learn to use the features.Something else to be aware of is holding the camera steady when squeezing the shutter button. I tended to get excited about capturing a particular scene, and hurriedly \"jerked the trigger\" before making sure the camera had time to focus properly. A smooth press of the button will also prevent motion blur from your own movement.This is something to especially keep in mind as the camera is small, about the size of a deck of cards, very light, and very sensitive to hand movement. That's just physics, not a design flaw. A larger DSLR is more stable because it is heavier.If I could change ONE thing about this camera it would be the zoom switch. I prefer a thumb-operated rocker switch to zoom in/out with. The Samsung has a ring around the shutter button with a little 'nub' on the edge which you use your index finger to move left/right to operate the zoom (you can see this on the product photo). To me, that little nub does not feel like I'm in very positive control of the zoom, and it can get a little irritating on the fingertip... but such is the price you pay for GREAT photos. I can live with the tradeoff.I also would have preferred a regular-size SD card vs. the Micro SD for storage.A word on battery life: I used the camera frequently throughout a 10-hour event with & without flash, using the zoom often, turning the camera on/off frequently. The battery finally died on me near the end of the event. If you are going to be shooting several hundred photos throughout the day, bring a spare. Otherwise, you will be fine with one.One great plus is the charging cord can either be plugged into a USB port OR a wall socket with the adapter included!.I recommend this camera to ANYONE looking for an inexpensive, compact digital that can take photos as good as an expensive SLR or DSLR. Just remember to read the manual and learn to use the versatile  features of this great item!*** UPDATE as of 13 Feb 2012 ***I recently took the camera to an indoor concert and figured out how to improve lower light shots and how to access the 50x digital zoom. First of all, you have to take the camera off \"Smart Auto\" mode. That unlocks the 50x zoom right there whereas in Smart Auto, the zoom is limited to the 20x Intelli Zoom. Also in manual mode, there is a light setting where you can basically allow in more light in darker settings. This completely eliminated my light & distance issues (I was sitting at one end of a hockey arena-sized floor & the stage was at the other end of the floor). The only other outstanding issue was the motion blur. With this and other non-DSLR cameras, that will still be a small problem. The way around it is to take several shots. For this particular event, I wound up snapping about 230 shots and had about 2 dozen \"keepers\". Not bad considering that you are not paying for film & processing (unless you want prints) and that you can get several hundreds to thousands of shots on the micro-SD card depending on the storage capacity.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Geldo", "ReviewID": "R2D3OSIWQMEL9G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here is a snippet of my experience with the Samsung PL210 Camera that I only just received.Pros: I tore open the package and was excited to finally have it in my hand. It takes high quality pictures. The video recording feature is one of the best i've seen for a camera in this price range and the speed is faster than my previous camera. Its a pretty decent camera for your buck.Cons: Samsung has decided to not go with the traditional and larger SDHC memory card but instead, the micro sd card is used in this one. I had one from another camera that I had planned to swap it from but when I opened the battery door i was surprised to see a tiny hole there instead of a regular sized one. Now I have to do something else with the SD card. Make sure that you know this before you purchase.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera for the money", "Author": "Jeffrey N. Kuhns", "ReviewID": "R16U4OANPLO7M3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for a trip over to Prague, Czech Republic.  I was looking over quite a few cameras on the web and in the local stores and found this to be the best fit for me.The Pros:1. Cost of the camera was excellent for a camera with a 10x optical zoom.2. Size of the camrea with an optical zoom.3. Light and compact.4. Simple to use straight out of the box.5. A lot of options for the casual user to the experienced photographer.6. Truly takes great pictures and videos.7. Very good battery life.Con:1.  Not a fan of the microSD card, but it didn't hinder my purchase.As I said, the camera was purchased as I went on a trip to Prague, Czech Republic.  I was told the city was absolutely stunning and it is just that, beautiful.  I didn't want to be wishing for better pictures after traveling that distance for what could be a once in a lifetime trip.  This camera did not let me down.I had the fortune of comparing the camera to several models in the store and it truly was the leader for the price.  The optical zoom was really the key to me making the purchase.  The more glass for the zoom the better the picture will be.Now, I know that there are two reviews of the camera that rate 1 star and let me give my opinion on those reviews.1.  As for the microSD card, that really doesn't make the camera great, good or bad.  Yeah, the card is small and you'll need an adapter for the small card, but most come with an adapter anyway.  Again, that't not changing how good of a picture or video the camera takes.2.  I was also part of a baseball camp for kids the ages of 8-14 and while on this trip action shots were more than half the photos of the week we were there and with trips into the city at night.  This camera performed excellent with the action of kids catching, throwing and hitting the baseball and took great shots of inside buildings and outside scenery as well.I'm not a great photographer.  The camera was mostly used in it's SmartAuto mode and it did a great job of focusing through most situations.  It focused fairly well in some low light situations as well.Lastly, I did look at other smaller Canon and Nikon cameras that friends loaned to me.  Each camera had good things about them, but I have only heard great responses from my friends when they see the photos and videos that we taken with this camera.You won't be dissappointed, I haven't been.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tradeoffs between zoom/features and price", "Author": "Colorado John", "ReviewID": "R30AM86EMW55H7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've used this camera for 2 months including indoor, outdoor, action, and video.  I love the long zoom for the price which is why I purchased this camera, however, the features are basic.  My biggest complaint is that there is no action setting to take a series of photos.  It is also inconvenient to switch between video and still as this requires walking through screen menus.  It would be better to have a camera with a video button and still button or at least a thumb wheel.  The camera has dual image stabilization, but don't expect it to be much help when using a lot of zoom.  It also uses a micro SD card, so you can re-use a full size SD.  The good news is that memory chips don't cost much.  The camera does not come with a video cable for showing pictures on a TV, but I believe they are available.  Overall, I should have checked the features more carefully and paid a little extra to get what I wanted.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMAZING CAMERA FOR PRICE", "Author": "AV8R", "ReviewID": "R3PAJBRIZ61N6I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, this camera is amazing!  It is everything that I want in a point and shoot camera.  It has truly amazing zoom, very good smart auto mode which does everything for you.  I am not a beginner photographer but I love using the smart auto feature in this camera because I want a nice point and shoot camera where i can quickly pull my camera out and take really good high quality photos quickly and with utmost ease.  One thing, do not make the mistake I made and buy a normal SD card for it because it takes MICRO SDHC cards.  Buy a nice 8GB Sandisk micro SDHC with SD adapter at Walmart for $18, its fast transfer rate and with the highest quality settings (14mp, superfine photo quality, full auto), you can get nearly 2000 photographs in one go.  The battery seems to be pretty darn good, probably better than using a couple of AA batteries.  I have used it on and off over the past week and it still has around a thrid of the battery left (one of the three bars showing on the battery icon and still taking really good photos).

It's pretty astounding that they fit a 10x optical zoom lens on something so small.- The video and picture resolutions are massive, and the jpeg quality can be set very high (98-99%).- The battery lasts a very long time.- The camera starts up and is ready to start shooting very quickly. Less than a second on average.Neutral:- I don't really mind the microSD card. They tend to be cheaper in my experience than regular SD. It can be an annoyance though, when you have to choose between using the cord or taking the tiny card out.Cons:- It can be a little slow to focus. Best to hold the shutter down half-way, wait for it to focus, and then snap the shot, otherwise there's a good chance it will be blurry in anything less than broad daylight.- The zoom is hard to be precise with. I often find myself zooming in and out repeatedly because I can't get it to where I want it. I usually just settle for zooming out and cropping - after all, the pictures are huge.- I don't like that video is a separate mode instead of just having an extra \"record\" button. If you're like me and sometimes need to choose between video and picture on a moment's notice - well, you can't.- The colors are a little bit dull, but this can be remedied with editing software.I take pictures nearly every day and I used to lug around my giant DSLR, which was tedious and made me look silly. That left me with my cellphone, which took horribly low quality photos. I wanted something that would fall in between the two extremes - something compact that had high optical zoom and would take decent photos. Overall I am very happy with this Samsung, and have recommended it to a friend.

McNeill", "ReviewID": "R30G8X6A3ETSV4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I makes my other camera look like a toy. I get shots of things that I couldn't even see on my old camera.Pros  1. Zoom- I can zoom and then get into editing and zoom digitally. I've got some pictures of birds that look like they are right in front of me. Seriously I've actually used it to ID things that I couldn't see. This here just makes it totally worth despite the cons. You can edit it and get just the part you want in the picture or you can get 2 or 3 picture out of one picture. I would think that this would be a good camera for surveying because you can take the pictures and then zoom in editing and study the details later. This is mentally a very interesting thing to me.  2. The automatic functions are a relief as you can get lost in all the possible ways to take a picture.  3. I've already mentioned the editing and this is something I am still learning about. There are some interesting picture this way. There are filter and you can get rid of red eye etc.Cons  1. You can forget about the night. I've actually got some pretty artistic accidental shots because it just doesn't seem to get the night at all. I guess it would work OK with the flash. No reason to try that. Bummer I really thought this thing would handle the night better. I wanted some good picures of the moon and the stars. I just got a tripod. I will try to figure it out with that. I've guess if you could keep the iris open longer. Forget action shots though.  2. It isn't intuitive. We are going to Alaska which is the main reason I got this camera. But I found it difficult to get the zoom going or the other shot right away. I take it with me and practice everyday until a lot of the functions have become second nature. There is automatic functions but you are still going to have to get in there and play around with them to get them ready. You have to hold the button down halfway for the automatic focus to kick in. If you don't want to deal with this then get spend the extra $50 and get a touch screen. If I see a bird I tend to slow up and zoom it before I get there by pointing it at the ground. Then you can get your shot before it flies away. I've got some great shots of birds in flight this way.  I don't know that I consider these practice sessions  to be a con. I actually consider it to be more serendipitous. I have got just got some amazing picture of birds and the hillside that I would have never gotten had I hadn't had the need to practice. Now this is my constant companion and I keep it handy bescause that picture is always there when you least expect it. I hated camera but this has converted me to being an amateur photographer. I have watched my pics go from the expected garbage to some picture that are even impressing others. Some just awesome pictures of birds. Just as close as you can get with the zoom There is a whole invisible world out there and this camera can help you find it. But these practice sessions have helped me in other ways as I am totally an amateur it has helped me discover strategies in shooting animals, landscapes, etc. that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "CheetahTrans", "ReviewID": "R33JVDL383ZJVY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera is great, for the price you get some awesome specs, I didn't expect to find this good of a camera for this price.

Ease of use - great little camera and fun to use. It has plenty of settings to try that are pre-programmed - Sun & Beach, Night etc. I used some of these on my first outing with this camera on our latest cruise. The back LCD is very good in different light. I took a lot of pictures on auto mode and did not experience any excessive out of focus issues. I did find that you can set the settings on this camera to not give you a perfect focus.2.) Zoom lens - This is a great feature of this camera. It can really zoom a long distance. I did have to review the electronic manual and there are limitations but none that are show stoppers. Since most of the shots I take do not require a long zoom range this zoom feature is icing on the cake so to speak.3.) Battery and USB/cord/charger - This battery is very good and can handle most anything you throw at it during day use. I did charge this camera every evening but noticed that I did not really see the battery diminish. I only was taking 10 to 20 pictures during the day on our latest trip so I would say I am not a power user. However I do have a Blackberry and iPhone and iPad and compared to these devices this camera battery is very good compared to these devices. USB cord is a charger / USB combination and easy to hook up to your computer.4.) Overall ease of use and quality of pictures very good. I have an older Olympus and this Samsung camera is very good and creates better pictures. I did not see the cycle times of 6 seconds like some users report however if you set the picture size to the max of 14mp then I can make the cycle time go long during some circumstances. Like low light and flash. The camera never really prevented my from taking any flash pictures nor did I experience this symptom in any excess. Flash pictures are good and this camera works well in most regular low light inside lighting conditions.For regular camera use this is a 5 - The only reason I give it a 4 is that there are times that by setting this camera incorrectly you can have some out of focus pictures but these are rare. It does require you read the manual to understand the zoom limitations and to understand the multiple settings that can assist with creating good photos. Out of the box you can leave it on Auto and it will work just fine. These are very minor issues and the overall performance for a point a shoot is very high and I would give this aspect a 5.Overall this is a good point and shoot...Since I purchased this the price has been as low as ninety nine dollars at Walmart.H.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Jeanne", "ReviewID": "R2PGHIHOMHE6BC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son seems to like it very much.

What appealed to me was its 10x optical zoom and the ability to take videos at 720p using h.264 compression (according to description of camera.)Coming out from my old 10x optical zoom camera, the picture quality of both cameras seems to be the same when taken outside in the sunlight.  I do like the many add-in features that my older and/or less expensive cameras doesn't have like auto face detection, HD video capture, scene modes and dual image stabilization (digital and optical).  Another surprising thing is that you can take HD videos AND zoom in/out at the same time.  All this for an inexpensive price.  Yes, this camera takes microsd cards instead of the standard sd cards, but I don't think it is a big deal.The Camera itself have 5 modes, 1) Smart auto - allows the camera to pick the optimal settings for you, 2) Program - allows you to mostly set the iso settings by yourself, and only in this mode.  3) Dual IS - Allows dual digital and optical image stabilization, other modes allow optical IS only.  4) Scene - allows you to choose your scene mode and the magic frame mode is kind of fun if you want to take picture of kids.  5) Movie - mode where you can take video up to 720p.Charging the battery can be done with included proprietary usb cable.  The cable is kind of short, but at least you can charge it in your computer.  For some reason that you can't sync the pictures/videos to your computer when using its usb cable nor does it include drivers for it.  So you will have to take the microsd card out and use a card reader in order to sync the pictures/video to your computer.  The battery is also kind of small and so you might want to consider buying another one.There are a few peeves that I have with this camera.  I am kind of annoyed its its so called 'smart auto' feature which in many circumstances actually gets out of focus when I take pictures in less than optimal conditions, so I have to take a the pictures again and it is sometimes to turn 'smart auto' off altogether.  File size issue are kind of weird too, more than 90% of the time the file size would be in the 3-4mb range when taken at 14mp but sometimes the file size takes up to 7mb for some reason.  Also, pictures taken at less than optimal conditions sometimes have considerable amount of noise.I don't like the location of the flash because it is too close to your right hand side when taking pictures and many times the pictures would be darker on the right side because my finger obscure the flash.Another peeve that I have with this camera is the compression used.  Most cheap cameras including this one use mjpeg compression and not the h.264 compression as advertised here so file sizes will be 8 times larger compared to an h.264 compression.  This was a major disappointment to me and I was really hoping to replace my older Sanyo vpc-hd700 but I guess it won't do that.  The audio quality is taken at 22khz mono instead of 44khz.Despite all the peeves I have, I think this camera is very good for its price at around $120-$150 range.  Samsung cameras have been getting better over the years but still not up to par with Canon, Nikon, Sony or Panasonic.  This camera won't replace my old Canon sx100is, but it will be a good small P&S; camera for everyday pictures.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quick, Great Quality and even better options", "Author": "JMP \"Notta\"", "ReviewID": "R2U3PQCK3MMN5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great!! I upgraded from a Nikon L18 8MP to this camera and WOW!! What I love is the buttons on this camera is basically the same as my old Nikon.The main reason I upgraded is my Nikon has always taken forever to take a picture, by the time the camera would snap the shot the object or animal would move andthe picture was no good.Pros:This Samsung camera is Quick, great quality and a great deal at this price. I bought mine at the local Walmart for $159.99, here you get itfor about $13 cheaper. Anyway it has a rechargeable battery which is super nice, just plug it in and then start snapping pics. The first time charge takes about 30-45 minutes.Cons:Only comes in Blue and Silver, would have liked more color choices.My Original choice was the Kodak M583 - the store was out of that camera, I almost purchased a Sony model but glad I went with Samsung. :)", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Takes great photos!", "Author": "David E.
