The other camera's would not work if they were in direct sunlight because of the infra red light from the sun so i could not put any camera near a window or door. You also cannot mount the cameras in any other position that flat because the housing cannot rotate or turn. If you try and mount them on a wall or ceiling your images will record upside down or sideways.I emailed the seller 3X about this to see about returning it and in 4 days they could not bother to respond. I had to file an A2Z claim with Amazon and then they finally responded after about two weeks. After returning the product it still took another 2 weeks to get a credit. I never did get refunded for shipping like i was told i would either, Just the price of the crappy camera system. I was very disappointed all the way around.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wrong Product", "Author": "Camera", "ReviewID": "R3EL5A25FQLSYD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a wireless security camera, but when the product arrived it was not wireless.
