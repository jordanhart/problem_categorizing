This camera has all of the capabilities I need and it works very well in low light events like shcool plays and concerts that do not allow flash.

And the pictures come out excellent. Get one of the upgraded flash units and you'll have even more fun with it. Of course, when you move to a dSLR, you get stuck with a bigger camera. Keep that in mind when you are walking around the amusement park and dragging all this equipment around. If the size does not deter you, than you certainly can't go wrong with the D80 or any of the cameras in the Nikon D line. All the features you could think of and more. Great colors in your photos. And plenty of lenses to choose from. Of course, with all of the features, comes lots of reading and learning how to take advantage of them.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "A.
