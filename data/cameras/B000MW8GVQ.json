{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy, good and lot of options", "Author": "Forza Catracha \"jcva13\"", "ReviewID": "R1AXHKL3CF3WXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a a very easy to use camera. I like that you can use the exposure control with the push of a button instead of going into de menu and the settings. So you can go from taking a picture under the shade to one with no shade and have the same exposure with a lot of ease and not looking around for the menu on the LCD display.It has very good image quality and light, and has a image stabilizer that allows you to take pictures still even if your had shakes.There is an normal mode: -intermediate usersIt has a lot of options for different kind of displays en purposes. You have 4:3 ratio to display on standard TVs or monitors, thinking of slide shows or wall papers. It gives you different size options, up to 7.2 MPIt has a 3X2 ratio that is optimized for printing 4X6 pictures or bigger prints. Althoug this only gives 2 MP or 6 MP pictures.It also has a 16:9 ratio for displaying or slide shows to be watched on widescreen TV's or Monitors. -This is my fave setting. But it only gives you 2 MP or 5.5 MP sizes.You can turn on and off the digital zoom, in my case I don't like it so I turned it off, but you might like it and you may turn it off and while zooming in it will tell you once you start digitally zooming.It has a basic mode: -beginnersIt sets up everything automatically and with very basic options instead of size in MP it gives you options like email pictures, 4X6 or enlarge. With everyday language instead of techie languageIt has a scene mode: -more advancedThis allows you to take pictures according to the lighting, weather conditions, portraits, sports etc. This gives you more control over how you want to take your pictures.It Takes video in standard 4:3 format and 16:9 Widescreen format, which is not very common in this price range or in cameras in general. Still i prefer to have a camcorder to shoot video.The only two things I don't like is the LCD screen which is bigger than the ones in my previos 2 cameras, is exposed to being touched, so you have to keep cleaning it if you don't want your finger prints on it. The battery life seems shorter than the Canon A75 that I replaced, but I guess that's because it records bigger files, has a bigger display and only uses half the batteries two instead of four. I'd recommend as with all digital cameras to get rechargable batteries as well as at least a 1 GB memory card. With 2 GB with the Widescreen at 5.5 MP it takes under 800 pictures, files are about 2 MB each so the 27 mb internal memory woulld barely allow me to take 13 pictures, less in 3:2 mode and even less on 4:3 7.2 MP format.At this price range you won't find a better camera, even some 5 MP or 6 MP cameras are selling even higher than this one.Before I bouhght it I did a lot of research and tried a lot of cameras of different brands and different MP size and this one was the one I like the best for quality image and options, most cameras don't have Widescreen option which I was very interested. This is good for beginners, intermediate or expert.This is the same as the Lumix LZ7S except for the zoom wichi has a bigger range on the other one, but for 3X you would have to pay 50 bucks more.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Small Camera for the Money", "Author": "Sara-s", "ReviewID": "R2G0R1E0STDWU6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a second camera.  For travel, I use a digital with a 10X zoom.  It's great for trips, but it's a bit bulky, for family gatherings or formal events (when I am carrying a small purse.)So I wanted a pocket sized camera, but since it is my second, I did not want to spend a lot.  I looked around in stores and on line and quickly settled on this model.  Why? It is nice and small and has all of the features I need.  A 3X zoom is fine for the events I mentioned and at 7.2MP, the picture quality is excellent.  It is also the only camera I found in this price range that had anti-shake technology.  It has many options for flash, as well as a variety of shooting modes (like sunset, macro, portrait, sports and so on.) There are thinner cameras on the market, but at about 1.2 inches, it's still nice, small and lightweight.It also used AA batteries.  I will only buy cameras that take AA's, because you can get them anywhere, if you run out.It has a couple of negatives.  There is no sound in video mode.  This is of no importance to me, but should be mentioned for other buyers.  There is a nice LCD screen but no viewfinder.  I'm an old photographer who is used to a viewfinder, so this takes getting used to.On the whole it's a great camera that suits my needs well.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nothing impressive about this camera", "Author": "Shaina", "ReviewID": "R1CIST7SC44G9K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my old Canon, which I dropped and got the infamous e18 error.  I was trying to avoid buying another Canon, and all of the Panasonics I looked at had great reviews.Before really using it, I liked the controls on the back of the camera.  There are a few shortcut buttons that allow you to bypass the menu, which is nice because the menu takes some getting used to.My first annoyance was the lag time between taking pictures with the flash.  There was a noticable wait while the flash recharged.  From my research I guess that this is normal, but I've never experienced it on my Canon or my HP.  Maybe it's only normal on cameras that take AA bateries.  The consecutive shooting mode has a pretty bad lag time too, even without the flash- I'd say at least 2 seconds.  That makes a big difference when you're taking a picture of something that's moving, and it meant that I missed a lot of shots that I hoped that the consecutive shooting mode would allow me to catch.  Then again, this was the first camera I've had with this feature, and maybe my expectations were too high.Then came time to get the hard copies of my pictures.  They looked great in the camera and on the computer, but the problem came when I had them printed off.  Only the outdoor, daytime pictures came out well, all of the others looked like they had been printed on my computer printer- grainy and pixelated.  I ordered them through a photo service I've used plenty of times before, so I know that the printer wasn't the problem.I had some of the pictures from my 2.3MP Canon printed off at the same time, and the difference in picture quality was unbelievable, I still don't see how that camera can take better pictures than this one.  I'm returning this camera, and hesitantly getting another Canon because I know that I will get beautiful pictures.  I'll just have to make sure to ALWAYS use the wrist strap when I'm taking pictures at a party :p", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price. Good deal", "Author": "J. Knoernschild", "ReviewID": "R3I6WNYBMJMU73", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a cheap digital camera with high mega pixels to take climbing. That way if it falls off the cliff, I dont have to care so much. I looked and read reviews on cameras for 3 hours before I picked out this one. I knew it didnt have sound for recording, but I didnt want sound. Easier to put music over it later. I got it because it takes great night shots. And boy does it, just adjust the iso setting yourself and you can get some great night shots. The pictures it takes are very clear and crisp. I got it also for the hand stabilizer because my climbing partner has very shaky hands. So the pictures will come out clearer when he uses it. There is a great option of scene selection. Just choice your situation and it sets up the camera for you. I used the sports setting to takes some pics of my cat running around and a fish swimming. It caught them without blur, nice and cleanly.There is only one small flaw. The camera image resets after taking a pic with the flash. But with only 2 batteries to run the camera, it makes sense. So when the flash recharges, you have no display. Only takes about 2 secs and the display is back. Doesn't effect much.All in all, I couldnt be more happy with this camera. I wanted a compact camera with video capabilities and high mega pixels with lower price, and thats what I got. And the video quality is pretty darn good. Better than a $300 Canon my fiance has. So if you are looking for an inexpensive camera that has great capabilities, get this one.", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "small, competent camera", "Author": "itsMalcolm", "ReviewID": "R2EYHET5CW5EFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little Panasonic camera, (Lumix DMC-LS70S, what a stupid name for a camera, eh?) is, nonetheless, a decent-little picture-taker.Thought it was \"eating\" batteries, but discovered I'd put in some old rechargeables; when I installed decent batteries, it was fine (NiMH rechargeables, of course--the only choice for digital cameras IMHO).Thought I'd miss the lack of \"regular\" viewfinder (it's only got the LCD screen), but I haven't, so-far.  Easy enough to see, unless in really bright light.  Not a problem.Snapshots on vacation turned out okay, nothing dramatic.  I did some test shots, comparing this little camera (it's small, really teeny) to my trusty Canon PowerShot A550, and surprise!  The pictures from this Panasonic were every-bit as good as the ones with my Canon (same subject, same lighting).  I was honestly surprised, but the pictures don't lie.It's a decent-little camera.  Takes good pictures, which is the whole point, right?p.s.- It is easier to take low-light pictures (without flash) with this Panasonic than any other digital camera I've owned--and, they come out better, too.  Image stabilization, I suppose, is why.  Whatever, it works well.  My wife took some family snapshots with this camera, indoors, without flash, and they looked really good.

I wanted something cheap that could stand going out and having fun. I had a Kodak 6.1MP that was fine but it lacked the image stabilization I needed (If you breathed you would lose the picture). I got my camera.... and it kicks the arse of my Kodak (even though at retail time it was about $200 more...go figure...).For one, my Kodak had 3X optical zoom then another digital zoom. This camera can do the same thing, but the picture is crystal clear in digital, kind of rare. The colors, esp. on \"Vivid\" are wonderful.The only downside is the controls aren't what I'm used to, but that's only because I am coming off the Kodak. It's actually a really snappy camera that doesn't have much in the way of time delay and really does know what's going on as you take your picture. The high angle, back light compensation, as well as preset situations that make more sense than some of the ones on my easyshare,  helped me to make the decision to pass my old camera on and keep this one for everything, not just the quick fun going out moments.You will love this camera. It's not the Rebel or a Nikon, but for everyday use that you can throw in a bag and go, I couldn't ask for more.
