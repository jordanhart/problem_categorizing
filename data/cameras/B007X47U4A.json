{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Perfect Camera! With Great Accessories!", "Author": "Ladyknight1825", "ReviewID": "R4HVJ0W26H9PB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera and accessory kit!  It provides everything you need to get started taking pictures immediately. This is my first DSLR camera, having used point and shoot digital cameras for over 8 years now, and I am extremely pleased. The Nikon D3200 base and 18-55mm lens are a great combo to start with.The 55-300mm is a wonderful lens that is absolutely worth the price for the quality of pictures it takes, and the amount of zoom available. I am amazed every-time I take pictures of the quality of the photographs.All of the accessories are great too: a nice waterproof bag with adjustable insides to make room for whatever lenses you are carrying, A stable tripod for long exposures, a powerful flash for when the regular flash just is not powerful enough to light up the space (I will mention the camera has to be on one of the 4 manual settings for the flash to work), a remote control for distance exposure (delayed or instant options), a memory card to start out with (This particular one was not quite enough for me - it holds about 1400 pictures, I actually ended up buying a 64 GB because I am often unable to download pictures for an extended period of time), 3 plastic coverings for the screen, a memory card holder, a cleaning set, and 2 filters (one for each lens!).Overall I am very satisfied with the quality of the product as well as the price (look up everything individually and you will be impressed too!) I was careful to pick this exact kit because it had all the accessories I wanted and none that I didn't. Again the 55-300mm lens was worth the additional $100 in my opinion as it provides that little bit of extra zoom that has made the difference in many of my photographs.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) + <2> Nikon 55-300mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Transcend 16GB Class10 SD Card +\n<4> Nikon Digital SLR Camera Case + <5> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control + <6> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash +\n<7> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <8> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter + <9> Precision Design 57\" Tripod +\n<10> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <11> Transcend SD Memory Card Case + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) + 55-300mm VR Lens + 16GB Card + Flash + Case + Filters + Remote + Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JPc0UU7EL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007X47U4A"}}
