Shipping was faster than expected. The only thing that was off is they sent a shiny black camera instead of the silver one and I don't like the finger prints but that's such a minor detail for me. It's still a great camera.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "good camer", "Author": "tys memaw", "ReviewID": "REYFV938LK8QU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just received this camera and it very nice.

Easy to use (especially) if you place it in the 'auto' mode.  The 'printed manual' covers alot but the 'cd' version on the installation disc covers alot more and answer most of your questions.  This camera was priced at $39.99 which was about $26.00 cheaper than the 'Kodak'.  Do recommend this Samsung Camera, great value!!", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exellent!", "Author": "Eunmi Do", "ReviewID": "R276DQGWGIHA0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a comfortable.

This was a gift so it was kind of annoying, since the person explicitly wanted a cheap, silver camera. If it was for me I wouldn't have cared.The larger issue was that the camera was broken. It turned on but wouldnt take any pictures. I spent about 3 hours with Samsung troubleshooting it because I was going on a vacation two days later. Nothing would work so I wound up just sending it back and buying a camera from Best Buy (for cheaper than it was at Amazon. I need to start comparing prices before just ordering here since it seems the gap has closed on most things).", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Basic digital camera at a good price.", "Author": "Glenn", "ReviewID": "R1FB4HV2YQ5QXV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Takes good clear pictures. 3x zoom so not great but not bad.
