I bought this because it was a great idea at an amazing price and I was somewhat certain I could make it work despite other reviews here.  My first intention was to use it on a Windows 7 32 bit computer, which the product description definitely says won't work, but I like a challenge *smile* ... The description says it is intended for Win2K or WinXP, so keep that in mind.Ordering was easy, delivery was fast, and packaging was as expected for the item.  What surprised me about the packaging is that the CD that came with it was obviously burned by the packager and not mass-produced. But hey, no problem there, it looks like all the needed software was present.I posted pics with the item as I unpacked it, installed software, and connected to the computer.  USB devices in general need the SOFTWARE INSTALLED FIRST to avoid headaches later, which I did.From the pictures, you can see that it did not install the drivers correctly.  This was expected.  So off to search the web I went, and found a great post almost right away (also in a pic) - just do a search on the terms easycap d60 win7 x64 drivers january 29 and it should be the first link.Now, the forum post says the drivers are for 64 bit, and I installed on 32 bit, but the drivers installed just fine.After a reboot, and searching for the software, I tried it and no joy.  Looking in the Win7 \"Devices and Printers\" area shows me that there is a new \"Unspecified\" device \"USB 2.0 Video Capture Controller\" so I'm still hopeful that I can make something work.Next I ran YawCam (also easy to find with a quick search), and looked for a new camera with that software, and there it was!  I hooked up the camera, and saw a black screen :(Hmm, so what might be the problem?  I had connected the camera to the yellow connector on the device with the \"1\" on it, so just moved it to \"2\" and now it works! I tried the others and no luck, so for me, only #2 works, which is still fine.I have not tested the audio.  I have not been able to run the software that it came with, so I can't say anything about that.Just that EVEN THOUGH you may only have a Win7 computer, this CAN still work, with a little fiddling, for one camera.Fun!I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the CD was burned and not produced.(this has also been edited again because it seems Amazon does not like external links in reviews, so I've changed links to search suggestions)", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Won't Record, Program Crashes!", "Author": "EJ \"EJ\"", "ReviewID": "R32WI7NI9HM6T2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item did not work as advertised.

I installed windows xp on VM Ware virtual machine and software installed just, took me ages to find original cd that come with this adapter, as you cannot just download it from internet it has some protection.So i installed driver and software on virtual machine fine plugged in camera and it looked like if it was scrambled lines going all over the screen and distorted like hell.
