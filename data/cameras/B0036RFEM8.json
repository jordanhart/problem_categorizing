{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So close Samsung.", "Author": "S. Smith", "ReviewID": "R27Z1GLG8LQ4XB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After hours of research, I decided that this Samsung HZ30W was the camera to buy after directly comparing specifications between this, the Canon SX210 and the Panasonic ZS5.I consider myself a serious amateur: I've owned 4 Canons from their SD line, and 1 Canon DLSR. I am buying this super-zoom to replace my sub-compact point and shoot but with features of a DSLR- a good mix between the two for everyday use.Here are the reasons I decided on the Samsung over the others:  I'll put the statistics for Samsung first and the comparison for the Canon in (parenthesis) and then the Panasonic in [brackets.]Flash Range:  5.0m (3.5m) [5.3 m]Zoom: 24mm-360mm (28mm-392mm) [25mm-300mm]Maximum ISO: 3200ISO (1600ISO) [1600 - 6400 in \"boost\"] - I don't know what the Panasonic \"boost\" is.Minimum focus distance: 30mm (50mm) [30mm]As you can see, these cameras have very similar specifications (for the things most important to me.) The Samsung is the smallest of the three and had a better flash reach and macro than the Canon and a better zoom than the Panasonic. It ultimately came down to the fact that the Samsung was cheaper, smaller and actually released, not to mention I could buy the Samsung at a major retailer with a 90 day return policy.I really like the lens on this camera. The wide angle is amazing; I can get so much more into my pictures- it made me dizzy at first.  The screen is large and very clear, and the buttons have a good lay out. I love the feature that I can compose the picture and hand it off to someone else and they line up the partially imposed image to take the shot I want. I can see this being very useful; no more poor composition from strangers. I like the way it feels in my hands; it has an intuitive fit. I like that the final image shows up on the LCD screen- with settings and all. (over/underexposure is immediately evident, can look at the picture in black and white...ect) All of these features make it easy for a novice but still interesting for more advanced users.There is only one problem. The picture quality is dismal. After being disappointed I decided to compare side-by-side the Samsung and my Canon SD850 (released in 2007). I set both cameras up and started test shooting and 2GB later there is no comparison. In every single shot, the Samsung is grainy, definite lines bleed, and there is too much noise. Sunlight, low light, flash, zoomed and unzoomed- the picture quality is terrible. As soon as you start to zoom in on the photo these problems are evident. I would not print anything this camera produces larger than a 4x6 format.  I really like this camera, but it ultimately comes down to image quality. This Samsung is put to shame by technology three years old. If it were not for the noise, I would suspect the poor image quality is due to a bad JPEG compressor, because quality this poor should not have made it to market. On a side note, I do not like having to plug in the camera to charge with a cord not even a foot long, it cant even rest on the ground while charging. (They do sell stand alone battery chargers separately/expensively.)I will return this Samsung HZ30W.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung HZ30W-Digital Point&Shoot; Camera- Fully loaded", "Author": "masood", "ReviewID": "R439D4AP0Z3QK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At the very ouset I need to make it clear that this camera is only a Compact Point & Shoot as classified by the manufacturer. Hence, it is only fair to judge it's features and performance in this light. We can not expect it's performance to be on par with any DSLR or even Advance point&Shoot; cameras.1. The body, size and shape are very suitable for a compact camera. The weight is also fair enough to handle it easily.2. The functional keys and navigator are suitably positioned and easy to operate, except the Zoom switch which is hard and takes a little bit more effort than ordinary.3. The mics are placed on the upper side of the body but these are very sensitive and have no problem for capturing the sound signals.4. The housing for the battery and the SD memory card is designed in a common compartment. It is not a significant issue. The covering door is easy to operate.5. The USB cable is dual purpose; works both for charging the battery in-situ and also for connecting to the computer for uploading pictures and videos. The main complaint about this is it is VERY SHORT. Perhaps it has been designed for laptops. Any how, it is not an issue in any way. The battery can be charged in-situ even if it is connected to the computer or laptop. It takes more than 2 hours to charge completely.6. The battery is capable of taking 350 snaps in one charge, if FLASH IS NOT USED.If FLASH IS USED it is sufficient for almost 200 shots.7. The Most Important part of this camera is the 24mm LENSE. It is very rare for a compact camera. It is very good for large groups and parties and for landscapes. The motor for protracting and detracting the lense at powering on/off and while zooming in/out works effectively.8. The LCD is very bright and clear. The 3\"Display is very good. The brightness of the screen is adjustable as per the sunlight for outside shots. The LCD is scratch proof.9. The FLASH is strong enough, though for some big hands and fingers may cover it inadvertantly while shooting.10. The Auto & Smart Auto modes work perfectly well. These modes are suitable for people who do not want to go into the drudgery of manual adjustments and going through 3 different sets of menus.11. The BEAUTY SHOT programme also is fantastic. It softens the skin tone and removes scars and blemishes. But the images are not sharp. Any how, for aesthetic purposes it is a good programme if not for technical and quality purposes. One may feel a need to have this at times.12. The dual IS is very effective while the subject is moving or the photographer is moving.13.The Program Mode is also effective in controlling many functional aspects, almost as manual control.14. The Manual Mode provides full control of the functional attributes of this camera. This provision is also very rare in compact cameras. Only some of the compact canons have. The manupulation of manual adjustments is a little time consuming as one has to take three steps to reach to the specific attribute to be changed.15. Apparantly there is no Burst mode; but in menu go to Drive Mode and select CONTINUOUS.16. Face detection programme is very effective. It can detect about 6 faces at a time. If the focusing area is Multi, then more faces can be detected.17. The fascinating programme is the Smile & Wink modes. It is a real fun. The camera takes the snaps automatically. The shutter button need not be pressed.18. There is a CHILD mode. It is good for moving subjects and children.19.The Night Mode is also good; But it raises the ISO value and pictures may get lot of noise and become grainy. Instead it is better to go to Manual mode and adjust the Aperture and Shutter Speed, Exposure compensation, keeping the ISO as low as possible. A tripod is always necessary.20.The Zoom!!! The Camera has an Optical Zoom of 15X. The function of zoom is related to the focal lengths of the lenses. Hence, 24x15 is much less than my Canon S5IS, 36x12. Any how, for such a small compact camera the provided zoom is very nice. You can not find this much zoom in compact cameras of 24mm.21. The camera is capable of focusing the subject very fast in sufficient abmient light. For low light condition it better to have a focus lock.22. VIDEO: Though there is a dedicated button for shooting video clips, one has to first select the Movie Mode on the Mode Dial.The videos are HD quality and very good in low light also. The sound is also very good and clear. The zoom works during video.23.PICTURE QUALITY: AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO PRINT LETTER SIZE AND BELOW, THE PICTURES ARE VERY SHARP,RICH AND VIVID. THE PRINTING PROPERTY OF THE IMAGES PRODUCED BY THIS CAMERA IS 96DPI AS AGAINST MY CANON S5IS WHICH HAS 180DPI. THIS IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE AS FOR MANY PURPOSES THE LETTER SIZE AND 4X6 PRINTS ARE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT. THE ISO IS GOOD UPTO 400.OVER AND ABOVE PRODUCE GRAINY IMAGES.24. The Intelli.Studio programme is also very good. It also provides all the basic editing software.25. Occasionally the pictures seem to be over processed. The colours are true and vivid. In my photos I have not found any colour fringing or vignetting. At the widest angle there may be some distortion of both horizontal and vertical aspects. It is normal for wide angles.26. I forgot to mention one thing. This camera LACKS PANORAMA MODE AND STITCH ASSIST PROGRAMME IN INTELLI-STUDIO SOFTWARE.27. It would be unfair if I do not mention the service of Amazon. It is very very satisfactory.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but bad pictures", "Author": "E. Davis", "ReviewID": "R2JU645IAHH52U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had waited eagerly for this camera to be released, and I'm afraid I have been disappointed.  Unfortunately I live in a country where a return of this is out of the question.  I'm a semi-pro photographer, used to carrying around much larger equipment, and I hoped this new product from Samsung would be the answer to an easy \"tourist\" camera.  I love being able to zoom into almost anything I want, and the wide angle is also very useful.  The video seems to work well and the sound is also good.My complaint is directed towards the image quality.  When you take a picture in normal conditions - good light, no momement - the picture looks really nice on the screen.  Until you zoom in.  I'm used to working on my photos at a near pixel level, and I have never seen any camera produce pictures as poor as this one.  All the edges seem to have \"wrinkles\" - most likely jpg artifacts from a poor processing algorithm.  It's definitely not the lens, and probably not the CCD chip that are causing the problem in this camera, I simply think it's how they decided to process the picture.  This does not change by choosing a different quality level in the menu either.I tried to contact Samsung support about this issue, and that was a joke.  I don't think they even know what \"jpg processing\" is.  I'm pretty sure this problem could be fixed with a firmware update, and it will be interesting to see if any customer complaints ever reach someone in charge of such things.  My detailed description of the problem got a response like: \"Put the camera in Auto mode to take you picture.  This should fix your problem.\"  Please!I would recommend not buying this camera until the IQ problem is fixed", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very sluggish, poor low-light shots", "Author": "Sergey Kiselev \"skiselev\"", "ReviewID": "R2299EE1HGTRA2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at Costco, as the replacement for my five years old Fujifilm F10 camera. And I was expecting to get something better at least in some aspects. But I am completely disappointed by this camera.Pros:- Relatively compact.- Good zoom, sharp shots with zoom if you have enough light.- Wide angle, useful for taking pictures indoors, or group portraits.- Good video quality.- Charged from USB.Cons:- Very sluggish - trying to take pictures of my kids. Kids run away before the camera focuses and takes a shot. It takes years to zoom in/out.- Poor performance in low light (even with regular room lighting). All photos are blurred, image stabilization doesn't really help. (A real disappointment compared to Fujifilm F10...)- Auto mode is disappointing. It doesn't allow changing white balance settings, and automatic white balance doesn't really work. All pictures I took at home (with warm luminescent lighting) turned to be reddish. Off course you can use manual mode or scene mode, but it will require some time to switch to that mode and adjust settings. And I really wanted point-and-shoot functionality.- Mode dial location (or shape?) is bad. It easily gets turned while taking camera out of the case.- Flash location (but it seems that many cameras these days have flash located near the grip) it easily gets covered by hand when holding the camera, takes some time to get used to it.- Custom and short USB cable (Samsung loves custom cables ;-), no video cable provided.Recommendation: If you're looking for a compact zoom camera, go to a real store and compare to Panasonic ZS* series, Fujifilm F80EXR, or Sony DSC-H55 and Sony DSC-HX5. I returned this camera and got Fujifilm F72EXR instead (it doesn't have HD video and only 10x zoom, but otherwise the performance is much better).", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great value!", "Author": "Bron \"Bron\"", "ReviewID": "R384YVSUIQ1QH9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Last updates: 2010-11-27. 2010-11-28, 2010-12-15Pros:  Outstanding color accuracy for this class of camera  -- very important for your images!  Exceptional range 24 mm wide angle to 360mm zoom (24mm wide angle is very rare at this price)  Image stabilization works (IS is not magic, though, good techniques still needed)  Lots and lots of features and options -- not just gimmicks, but useful ones! (e.g. Zoom works in video mode.)  Great all around \"can do everything\" camera, good battery life, very portable and easy to carry  Acts a lot like a DSLR class camera, rewards smart use with great results  Nice size, great build quality, feels like a $400+ camera  Produces beautiful images with good dynamic range (some highlight clipping) and color  Good value -- lots of bang for the buckCons:  More complex than a simple P&S; (not sure if this is really a con?)  Some noise at higher ISO levels, but good results up to 400-800 ISO) true for most cameras in this class  External battery charger not included (but fairly cheap to buy)  Some clipping of highlights in bright lighting conditions (common with P&S; models)  Doesn't have the AMOLED LCD of the HZ35W -- but LCD is fine as it is and price is right.  Menu setup will take some getting used to -- but works well once you figure it out.I received my HZ30W in late Nov 2010 and here are my initial impressions:Nice size and heft, great build quality, metal body chassis with plastic panels, excellent access doors for battery, ports.  Very easy to use.  Great menu system once you figure it out.  Easy to set main things quickly (e.g. pic size/quality, exposure, etc.).  Very strong flash for a compact P&S;, great auto white balance indoors with artificial light (where many fail), nice, smooth 15X Zoom (!), controls well placed and easy to use.Picture quality seems good for the compact P&S; class, comparable to its peers.  All of the compact P&S; cameras struggle with \"noise\" at high ISO's and this one is no exception, but it varies depending on subject and I got some great images at ISO 400-800, but best to stay in 80-400 range, normally. I set the ISO at 100 and took some test shots indoors and they came out great.  The image stabilization seems to work well enough.  Colors were very true, exceptional, really, at this price point.  I was amazed.  Took some pretty good low light indoor video as well (again if your expectations are reasonable).  Being able to use the zoom when taking movies is a good plus missing from many of its competitors.Much better than average user manual (can download from Samsung site) is actually useful and well worth reading for the new owner.  It's nicely written and laid out, a pleasant surprise as many these days show almost no effort or care at all.  There are plenty of good illustrations and clear explanations of the camera's functions and how and why to use them.  Kudos to Samsung!  (Too bad a full printed manual is not included, you get a PDF file, but those days are gone, alas!)Compact, but not so small you can't hold properly (some of the new compacts are so small as to be a bit harder to hold and shoot with, in my opinion).  I have average size hands (man) and this feels about right, though I tend to prefer even a bit bigger as I am used to my DSLR's and the nice grips they have.I think this camera is better suited for a more experienced user and maybe not the best choice for a first camera, but if you are looking for PASM/full manual controls and a long zoom in a compact size with lots of options and features, I think this has to be on your short list.Color accuracy is truly excellent (outstanding for this class, I'd say) and the lens seems excellent as well.  Great 24mm wide angle is very nice to have, probably more important than the long zoom in many situations.  I love the zoom, though, that's what first attracted me to this model.  Some clipping of highlights in bright lighting conditions. Common with P&S; models, but fairly extreme in some shots.  Good dynamic range, overall, though.It is somewhat unusual to find so many features on a camera at a price this low.  It handles very well and is a great package overall.  If you need a compact \"must do it all\" camera, this is a fine choice.I like this camera. It's an incredible value, I think, and if you use your head and take a little care (true with any camera), you have quite a tool in the Samsung HZ30W that should produce many fine images.  I gave it 4 stars because it has a few quirks, but it's a solid 4 stars.  You might even add a star at the low price it's being offered at currently.Great job, Samsung, thumbs up!Updates/Additional comments:IMAGE QUALITY:  Since many of the reviews here slammed the image quality, let me say I disagree.  I have only had time to do limited tests, but the images seem par for this type of camera.  As noted, colors are simply beautiful, very good tonality and accuracy.  I also noticed better than average dynamic range, good detail in highlights and shadow areas.  I got some gorgeous images in evening sunset lighting and indoors as well.  I did notice that the images are not \"sharpened\" as much as many compact P&S; cameras tend to do.  This is a benefit, in my opinion.  It gives you, the photographer, more control.  If you are viewing on-screen or on a digital viewer/frame, just add a touch of \"unsharp mask\"(or whatever your favorite \"sharpener\" is), but it won't be needed for most prints. Of course, you can adjust the settings so the camera will add sharpness internally to each shot...if you insist. ;)Chromatic aberration is very controlled and I noticed only a little \"purple fringing\" in worst case tests, much less than average.  Also, distortions (for such a wide-to-long lens) are well controlled.  A nice lens overall and a bit of a marvel, really.Hand-held, I got a few shots at the full 360mm at 1/20, 1/30, and 1/60 that were good (using dual IS). I could see a little movement on the 1/20th shot when I blew it up on screen, but the print would look fine.  It is almost impossible to shoot hand-held at 360mm with any camera, much less a small compact, but it can be done.  Just don't be surprised that your percentage of good shots will be low. That it can be done at all is amazing.  Be happy. ;)I noticed what I think are some jpeg compression artifacts in broad, solid areas of color.  Not uncommon in P&S; cameras and not enough to be objectionable.  At really high ISO's luminance noise becomes a real problem, but this is true for almost all cameras.  The higher ISO's are not going to be very useful, but they almost never are in P&S; cameras, especially with this many pixels crammed on to such a small sensor.  I was able to get some usable shots up to ISO 800, which is pretty good.  Results at ISO 400 and below are fine (yes, there's some noise, show me a compact camera in this price range without noise at ISO 400...there aren't any!).Use the playback mode to judge quality when shooting.  The quick image shown after the shot is not fully representative, probably not processed completely.  All images looked better on my laptop than they did on the LCD, but the LCD was accurate enough to judge exposure, color, and detail when shooting.To judge image quality for prints, if you really want to do it right, print your test images in the sizes you normally use.  You'll be surprised how much better they look when you're not \"pixel peeping\" on your monitor.Want to judge the image quality for yourself?

I actually like it now, but it was confusing at first.Also dpreview.com gave the HZ35W the top rating \"Gold Award\" in their travel P&S; face-off against very tough competition.  They liked it a lot.  Most of the competition is over $300, HZ30W <$200.  Superb value in my opinion.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "The perfect little camera!", "Author": "Samantha L.

I must say I made the right choice in ordering this camera, because i feel this camera is perfect for people who love taking pictures for fun with high-grade photos and videos as a plus. It is light weigh and easily portable(in comparison to how bulky cameras really used for professional photography). The zoom is out of this world and I could tell there was still great quality even almost zoomed to its fullest. What has me in love with this camera is the video capture. I have not seen anything clearer and vibrant in common everyday cameras. What I've seen on other cameras is maybe some  choppiness, and some grainy look (which unless thats the look you want is just wrong for this day and age.) The price is amazing too. I couldn't believe something this great was around $250. I Have just gotten a 16GB SDHC card, because I know I will be taking many, many photos and videos.

I have also read a lot of reviews before I bought it but they are all mixed. Since I like the 15x optical zoom very much, I would decide to give it a try.However, after a 4 days trip in Las Vegas/Grand Canyon with 500+ pictures in day and night, we would conclude that this is the best camera for our need as a regular point and shoot users who wants ultra-zoom feature but not want to sacrifice the portability.The feature which I like the most:* Lens with 24mm. One of the very few Point & Shoot compact camera with this wide angle lens for self portraits as well as large group shoot. I found that I can never go back to 35mm after using 24mm.* 15x optical zoom (360mm). One of the largest optical zoom in this category.* Fast boot up (at least not slow) and the zoom speed is fast too (for a 15x zoom).* Well made metal body with stylish. It is not the lightest but the feel and the ergonomic is very good. The body is small enough to put into my pocket.* It comes with a lot of nice features which you may not expected in the camera for this price range. Eg. Dedicated video button for fast video shooting, smile/blink detection, HD video with full zoom enable.* Price is good for low $200 which the other major brand can't never come close with similar feature and quality.* Picture quality is great. In my case, both day and night, indoor and outdoor shoot are good even with the auto setting. With the manual mode, you can shoot the picture in all environment.* The camera user interface is easy to use. Also, The build-in PC software Intelli-studio is user friendly.* They have the wide screen (16:9) picture sizing as an option which is good for viewing in TV (we normally use our TV as the monitor).To be improved:* Smile detection can be improved. I need a \"big smile\" for the camera to detect it which I don't prefer.* Video quality could be a little better. It is not bad but it is not the greatest.* Can't tell the difference in Video with or without the Dual stabilization.* The LCD monitor would be better. It is not easy to see under the direct sun (I knew the HZ35W has a better monitor but it is $100 more with the GPS feature which we don't need much).For this price point, I would say this is the best bang of the buck.

The small sensor size and limited lens speed simply doesn't make it feasible no matter which brand makes it. So with that in mind, I needed to have compact, handy camera that can go pretty much anywhere with me and take good quality pictures for up to medium size printing or viewing on web. Also I wanted to have better indoor image quality with flash. I had Panasonic ZS3 several months and while it's strong performer in outdoor, the indoor shot with flash left a lot to be desired with inaccurate colors. So I gave this HZ30W a try after seeing good reviews. Wow, the flash is so strong, uniform and indoor shots look so much better than ZS3. It doesn't make sharper images than ZS3, but it can reproduce the indoor color so accurately with realistic looking tone. So the overall look and feel of HZ30W indoor picture is so much more pleasing to me.Now in outdoors, it's about neck and neck in picture quality. But HZ30W has a little more reach in telephoto end of zoom (15X vs 12X) and slightly wider lens (24mm vs 25mm). Auto-focus is pretty fast and image stabilization in telephoto regions works well too. Distortion and sharpness of image is well controlled across the entire zoom range. My only gripe is that optical zoom lens moves in a little jerky fashion with small multiple steps. The HD video is recorded in MP4 format which is good for editing, uploading in PC. You can use zoom and pause/resume during video recording too. It's not as sharp as AVCHD video from ZS3, but looks like fairly good quality. But these are minor cons for me and it's got well balanced photo performance in any situation without major weak points. It also has several neat features for portrait shots like smile detection, blink detection, child mode, beauty shot mode.

The interface is time consuming and when you are constantly swapping modes and selecting functions to get the right shot as a photographer you'll go mad.

I get 3 hours and 25 minutes of 720p HD video recording or 2350 top quality still pics. And because it's a class 10 card it has transfer speeds of up to 20mb/s so you can take that next shot faster.

Her and I agree it's the best overall in features, hardware quality, picture quality, and zoom in a \"point and shoot\" camera we've seen.  The blink detection works great at catching people that blink and automatically snapping a second photo before anyone can move.  The smile detection is her favorite feature.  You don't even have to press any buttons.  With smile detection on, just point the camera and it uses the face detection feature and will not take the picture until every person is smiling.  Once you smile, snap, it takes the  picture on its own.  Micro shots are a breeze with incredible detail.  So many settings for you, there isn't an occasion/person/or place it can't handle.  Night shots come out great while still maintaining the detail that we had with day time shots.  Now, obviously it can't match the quality of the $700+ cameras(that's why those cost $700+), but if you want a compact point and shoot for those special occasions/vacations/etc that fits in a purse/bag easily, has a zoom that triples most point and shoot cameras, and still getting near SLR quality photos then you can not beat this camera for the price.

I went to a store with my SD card and put it into three cameras. The Nikon S8000, the Panasonic TZ6and this camera. I sort of figured a camera is a camera and the stills shots would be pretty much equal what would make or break it would be the video. So I shot stills and video on my SD card. I bought my 1GB SD from my Nikon Coolpix 7900, the S8000 just added its pictures and video to the list. The Panasonic added it's stills in and complained the card was not formatted by this camera for video use. Hmmm... And I'm a Panasonic fan too. I thought it did not record nay videos, but I found many short 1 second video when I got home.The HZ30W added its pictures and video and had no complaints. The TZ6 shoots video in M-Jpeg mode and is very sharp. he Nikon and Samsung both shot in H.264 mode and were very comparable. The TZ6 was $89 more than the HZ30W, and the S800 was $59 more than the HZ30W.After seeing the popup S8000 flash and wondering why they added moving parts for no good reason and also seeing the rubber plug covers, I was very impressed with the metal hinged door and metal knobs on the Samsung. The other two had burst mode, the Samsung did not. But after looking at the videos and stills I didn't think they justified the extra dollars.I was very impressed by the 15x zoom on the HZ30W. The charger adapter come with a short  about a 20 inch cord for USB to samsung power. So the battery is changedIN the camera. So buy an extra charger and batteries.  My last Nikon suffered by the broken batter door, so I especially was impressed with the Samsung construction, It seem the best in the lot of these three. The 12 megapixels vs 14 isn't really an issue like it  was years ago. The 15x zoom lens is a plus. The menus are well designed and easy to use and offers a lot, including face detection and shoot on smile! You can not shoot stills while recording video.

It has excellent image quality but it does not allow for aperture or shutter speed control. The DMC-TZ5 also does exposure bracketing, which is good for HDR photography.  The TZ5 has a good zoom (10x).After reading extensive reviews on [...] where it's GPS-enabled cousin was favorably rated for its features and image quality, I bought the HZ30W because it has manual control, plus exposure bracketing, plus a good zoom in a small body.Tests: I set both the HZ30W and the TZ5 up on tripods and shot landscape photos with a range of detail in good light using a range of values for both cameras (intelligent auto, auto with changes to the fine and pixel settings, various values in zoom, and macro shots).  I also compared exposure bracketing and shot with the manual settings on the HZ30W.  I also included a Canon S3 IS as comparison.Results: The HZ30W was the worst camera of the three in terms of image quality across all of the tests, with the exception of very close-up macro shots, where it did a good job.  The HZ30W has the best range of fun and possibly useful features (smile detection shoots a picture as soon as a smile is detected, for example), but the image quality problems mean I will never use it.  It also has some quirks that are annoying.  For example, the exposure bracketing is only in .5 increments (rather than 1.0 for the TZ5) and when you have the feature on, you can't use the timer, so you will get a bit of shake from pressing the button on the first photo.  This makes aligning photos for HDR shots more problematic.Advice: If you want zoom and take a lot of people shots, this camera may fit your needs.

Nearing its first birthday I have few really positive things to say about this camera despite how generally easy it is to set up, the menus really aren't too horrible, the video quality beats the other two cameras (but not by much), but what really ticks me off is the poor image quality.First off the LCD screen is horrible, nothing looks good on it, even if the picture is decent. The same could be said if you connect your camera to a TV, regardless whether you use the HDMI port or the RCA cables (I purchased mine through Samsung directly).Second the image quality is...well...not what you'd expect for a 12 MP camera at this price range. The only modes I'm truly happy with are its Smart Auto, it selects a scene and usually does a fairly good job getting a decent picture, and the fireworks mode which if you time it properly and have the camera completely still and have a good angle at the fireworks you should get a decent picture. I spent hours taking pictures on the fourth of July and most of the pictures with the exception of the fireworks shots were fine, the fireworks ones okay once I got used to the reactivity of the camera.My biggest complaint however is image clarity. Even when properly focused the fine tuned focus is rarely correct. When looking at the 12 MP images at around 75% the flaws are really apparent. No image is ever very crisp or in focus, regardless of the capture mode or use of a tripod. The cache memory feels ultra slow and the flash takes a long time to recharge.I wouldn't consider myself a prosumer, I primarily use the camera for quick shots for Facebook and capturing memories with friends.

The model I received was fine, in great shape, looked brand new.But after tinkering around with the camera, I found image quality to be sub-par.  My Canon SD1200 and my Sony DSC-H20 both take much better photos.  I don't understand why this Samsung has TWO different Auto modes.  Most cameras just have one Auto mode, along with a mode for Scene, P, A, S, M, and movie mode, etc.  It doesn't really make sense.  I got the best results in the auto mode that has the little green icon, not the mode that says \"Auto.\"  Any other mode could not capture movement, everything was blurry.Also I thought the 15X zoom lens would be a great feature, but when I took photos all the way out at 15X, everything turned out blurry.  I stood on my back porch and tried to take a photo of the flowers on my cat's grave on the other side of the yard.  Every photo turned out blurry with a lot of noise.  Somebody below mentioned that you need to use a tripod if you expect to get clear photos when using the long zoom.  Not true.  My Sony camera has a 10X zoom and I've been able to take plenty of still photos all the way out and it can take photos just fine.  You shouldn't have to use a tripod for a point and shoot camera!And video mode was VERY disappointing.  I used a SanDisk class 4 SD card and filmed a few video clips at the 1280 size (NOT in HD mode, just regular.)  After playing them back in VLC player, every single clip had a problem with jumpiness and pixelation.  None of them were smooth.  Somebody had mentioned they thought it was some kind of processing issue with the VLC player.  But my Sony camera also records its video clips in MP4 format, just like this Samsung, and I've NEVER had any kind of problem like that with my Sony, and I always use the VLC player to play its video clips.I also noticed this camera had a problem focusing on close up items for the macro mode.  I tried both of the auto modes, and close up photos turned out blurry when I tried to take a photo of newspaper text close up, but on the other hand it worked okay for flowers.I don't like that when zooming, the camera doesn't show you a number to let you see how far out the zoom is going - all you see is a line sliding across a bar.  Also when selecting video file sizes in video mode, it doesn't tell you how much time you have left to record on the SD card for each file size you select.  (My Sony camera does both of those things.)Some people complained about the menu structure, but I actually didn't mind that.  In fact I liked it better than what I've seen on some other cameras, like Olympus and Nikon.A certain digital camera reviewing website based in the UK (you know which one I'm talking about!) gave this Samsung camera glowing reviews, but I'm not sure why.  After I went back and looked at close up views of their \"studio comparison\" shots from the cameras in this class (the photos that have all the different colored objects positioned around a white background), it was clear to me that the Sony H55, HX5, and Canon SX210 all had sharper images with more accurate color.  I think that website is always a little too obsessed over whether or not a camera has a \"wide angle\" lens, but to me that's not the most important thing.I followed that website's recommendations once before after I read their review of a certain Kodak model, and I was disappointed with that camera as well, because every indoor photo that I took always had a yellowish/green cast to it.  I think I'm just going to stop reading anything on that site and only read reviews at Amazon from now on.  Seems like the reviews here are more accurate and honest!Maybe there's a reason why, whenever I go to a certain big box electronics store, they always recommend Canons and Sonys.  Which is what I already have anyway!  I keep trying to find the perfect camera that will have a little bit bigger zoom than my Sony and would combine the best features from both of my current cameras (they both have their little quirks, but overall are good cameras) but I guess I'll have to keep looking.  I thought about getting the Canon SX210, so maybe I'll go ahead and get that one instead.
