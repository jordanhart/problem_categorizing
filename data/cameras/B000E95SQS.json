{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Couldn't be more pleased.", "Author": "Shane Carpenter \"sh6ne\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZI1IPAIQZR8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased (and received) this camera from Amazon.com and I'm ecstatic. If you're looking for a high quality (compact) point and shoot digital camera, look no further.First of all, although the camera is extremely lightweight, it is very well-made. If you're anything like me, you take good care of your possessions, but at the time same, you don't want something so fragile that you spend more time worrying about it than actually enjoying it. With this camera, you don't have to be preoccupied with damaging it in any way - which is the case with most other compact digital cameras.Second, in addition to its durable body, the huge 2.5 inch LCD is strong (i.e., wont crack), scratchproof, and waterproof. I like to keep my camera in my front pocket and so I don't want a camera that has a fragile screen. In this respect, the camera gives me some leeway in case someone bumps into me at a bar or club, or if I take pictures in a moist environment. Once again, I love the ruggedness of this camera.Third, the camera is just beautiful too look at. The  metal casing is sleek, there are not many buttons, and the camera is slim enough to fit in my front pocket, yet not small enough to make me worry about dropping it.Fourth, the picture quality is superb. I know a few of the more \"renown\" digital camera review sites said the picture quality was merely \"acceptable\", but I found that it is not the case. Sure you may run into some quality issues when you make 16 x 20 prints, but as far as keeping them on your computer (e.g., for saving and emailing) or making 4 x 6 prints, this camera is more than fine.Lastly, the flash works great in multiple light settings. One of the biggest issues I've had in the past with digital cameras has involved pictures being overexposed or underexposed, depending on available light. I've taken about 40 pictures with my Stylus in various light settings, and all have turned out near perfect.People have to realize that when one purchases a digital camera, he/ she does so because he/ she has certain needs. For example, you might be able to take higher quality pictures with a digital SLR, or even a bigger digital camera (e.g., a canon powershot), but can you keep those cameras in your pocket? Do those cameras make people oooh and aaaahhh? There's always an opportnity cost involved when choosing a digital camera, but for the best all-around compact camera, the Olympus Stylus 710 is a very wise choice.", "Date": "March 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Olympus Stylus 710", "Author": "Nicole", "ReviewID": "R2655GAOG47VNR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome camera!

Malin Jr. \"Thievery Corporation Fan\"", "ReviewID": "ROEMSI7DTK0PM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is not weather proof as claimed and Olympus will find any reason to void the warranty.  I purchased this camera about five months ago, and was very pleased with it those first five months.  The high resolution and many shooting modes worked well.  I purchased this camera over the many, many other cameras with similar resolutions because of Olympus' claim that it is \"weather proof.\"  However, the first time I used it in the rain, the camera failed completely.  When I opened up the battery compartment, there was water inside. Olympus refused to cover the repair under warranty because my camera was not in brand new condition because it has some normal nicks and scuffs (the kind that happen to anything that you keep in your pocket all the time).  So, I have to pay Olympus $193.00 to fix their defective camera.  BE WARNED -- Olympus will void the warranty unless your camera is in out-of-the box new condition, so the warranty is not worth the paper it is printed on.  Olympus has the worst customer service of any large company I have ever dealt with and the sole purpose of their customer service department seemed to be to deny warranty claims.  I recommend against purchasing any Olympus product.", "Date": "September 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "It just gets smaller and smaller", "Author": "James Ferguson", "ReviewID": "R39OTHA4YIVSHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Leave it to Olympus to come up with a nifty camera that not only gives you a mammoth amount of pixels but a rechargable lithium battery and up to 1 GB on a tiny film card.  I can't believe how compact it all is, and best yet easy to use.  The camera casing is brushed metal and comes in four distinctive colors, not two.  It feels durable, not like the plastic digital cameras you see in a similar price range.  A nice big screen on back allows you to focus in on the fun with 3x optical zoom, with a handy turning knob that allows you access to various features.  The menu is pretty much self-explanatory but there is a booklet to guide you through the process and open you up to the world of possibilities.  The internal hardware allows you to print directly from the camera, provided you have a compatible printer, and the CD's that come with the camera pack allow you to stitch together panoramas on the computer as well as other fun things, with the USB connection that is included.  The only thing missing is a compact carrying case to properly store all these items, so that you don't misplace them.  All in all, this is a great package at a great price.

Small but Powerful", "Author": "Kathleen \"kathque\"", "ReviewID": "R1LMPI78A6SVR5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a month ago and absolutely love it.  It's small enough to fit in a pocket, even in it's case, but it takes amazing pictures.The LCD display is good quality, clear and easy to see in most situations.  The buttons are nicely positioned and easy to use without thinking.Using special features is easy.  I've had other digital cameras before and couldn't remember how to do most of the special without referring to the instruction books.  That is not a problem with this camera because the built-in menus walk you thru the features, such as macro, super-macro, rapid-fire action shots, low-light, indoor, fireworks ... you name it and it's there.  You just scroll thru the menu and when you find what you're looking for you just hit the OK button and the camera is ready to go in that mode.  Very simple.The 7.1 MP quality allow you to blow up the pictures and digitally enhance easily with no \"graininess.\"  For example, I took some pictures of a Fireworks show and then touched up and cropped the photos to remove some of the backgrounds.  I was able to make clear, clean and very professional-looking posters in both 16x20 and 20x30 sizes. Even cropped the 20x30 size is clear as a bell.  I'm even thinking about entering these pictures in photo contests!  I have a new hobby - talk about fun!Changing the battery, removing the memory card and linking over to the computer is easy.  Be sure to get the 1Gig memory card ... with 7.1 MP you'll need the extra space.The only things I'm not as fond of on this camera are the red-eye function (you have to re-select each time you turn on the camera or change modes) and the optical zoom (my last camera was stronger).  But, because of the high quality of the pictures, cropping, modifying, and cleaning up red-eye is pretty easy on the computer.  (I use Microsoft PictureIt!)As you might have guessed, I love this camera and highly recommend it to anyone, from pros who want a pocket-size camera and to point-and-shoot novices.  Try it ... I'm sure you'll like it!", "Date": "July 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Shaky Hands People Unite", "Author": "Stacey J. Schacter \"Astroman\"", "ReviewID": "RVN3MCAHS1E9N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchased not one, but four of these cameras.  After I researched and bought one for myself, I found the camera to be so user friendly and provide such a high quality image that I had to get one for friends and relatives as holiday gifts.  The camera over all is very easy to use.  But, probably one of the gratest features is the ability to achieve different ISO's simply by selecting a scene from a menu.  Are you in a low light situation, just select that option.  How about a low light situation where you want to take a portrait, then select that option.  These options are not buried deep in some sub-menu, but rather are found with a click of a wheel and the use of the down or up arrow.My family and I went on vacation to Europe.  We had an opportunity to use the camera in museums (yes, there is a museum mode), at night at the Eiffel Tower and during bright day trips while riding a bicycle.  All the pictures came out great.  What was nice about the bike trip is I was able to select the shaky hands mode which provides for a much higher shutter speed.  Despite riding over cobblestones all my pictures came out crisp and focused.  This mode is also very nice for those who may be elderly or who otherwise have a hard time keeping the camera still.If you are using the camera in a low light situation it does take some steady hands to get a great picture.  You are better off with a tripod.  The time lag between pictures could also be better, but I found that for a camera in this price range it still is one of the fastest ones on the market.Also, depsite a few falls and quite a lot of travel, the lcd screen has not cracked, scratched or otherwise lost picture.  I gave 4 out 5 merely due to the time lag between pictures and due to the amount of time you need to hold the camera still in very low light situations.  While the flash seems good, I would say it is only average compared to other cameras I have used.With a large enough xD chip, you can even take a good amount of movies with this camera.  A very good choice for a compact to sub-compact camera.", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Versatile Camera", "Author": "Leonard Mayer \"Instructor\"", "ReviewID": "R2WFK29R52WSZR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I find the 710 7.1 MP Stylus to be versatile. I use it to take pictures of job sites for cabling and PC installs. I also take some pictures of New York to send to friends. It connects directly to hub port for easy transfer of photos without additional equipment. It has certain prefixed shooting apertures that you can select for portraits, landscape, night shots, etc. However, if you take a picture at night, many times I find that the picture comes out darker after I transfer the image to the computer. If you move the camera while taking picture at night, very frequently I get blurring of images. If you take pictures of animals, their eyes are frequently red. If you want to take pictures of people in low light conditions you have to point the camera at an angle to prevent glare in their eyes in final picture. It works well in well lit conditions. The macro is not as good so that if you really wanted macro imaging of documents you would be better getting a more expensive digital camera. So I think the camera has many uses in many different situations. If your needs are simple, then this camera will serve your needs adequately. But if your needs are more demanding, then a higher end model would be appropriate and you will be disappointed if you choose this model.", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Big Disappointment", "Author": "C. Mattis \"Personal choice\"", "ReviewID": "R1VOF76IBBWKZ2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was very disappointed with this camera.  The description says it has a digital stabilization mode but you couldn't prove it by me, as so many photos turned out blurry.  Another huge problem was its slow shutter speed, as time after time, I would lose a shot when friends using other cameras and snapping their shots at the exact same time as me got their photos.One important consideration:  the camera does not have a view finder, only the LCD monitor on which to center the image.  Perhaps I'm hopelessly old fashioned but I really missed the view finder as using it helps to stabilize the camera and makes centering the image so easy.  It takes steady hands to hold a camera at arms length, find and center an image and click the shutter--no wonder the shaky photos.  But perhaps the worst failing of the LCD monitor is the glare factor on a sunny day.  It makes it very difficult if not impossible to see any image on the screen.", "Date": "October 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very capable and stylish camera.", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R266QO0A665XAI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've not been a fan of Olympus' most recent compact digital cameras, but the Stylus 710 is winning me over.First, it's just a gorgeous camera.  It's unusual shape makes it appear very small once it's in your hands.  Its metal finish looks smart yet rugged.  Controls on such a small camera are always less than ideal, but they're done well here.The menu is very good, especially in the photo example/text description it gives you in the scene modes.  Don't have your manual?  Just turn the selection dial to the \"guide\" mode, and it'll get you there!The weather proof ability sets this apart from most of the competition.  You may not plan on using your camera in the rain, but the rain may not plan on your taking pictures!As I've stated before, I'm not a big fan of the xD cards.  SD is simply dominate right now, easier to find, more capatible with more things, and usually easier to find a bargin.  But the new \"H\" series cards are of equal quality to the best SD cards.

The Olympus Stylus 710 seemed to have the most features, smallest size, and most megapixels for its price range. The camera was great for my trip, I had plenty of opportunities to use the many different scene settings and it was extremely easy to carry around. I love that I didn't have to worry about getting it wet and after being shoved into my beach bag constantly there is not a scratch on it. The LCD screen is huge and makes sharing pictures with others easy since I have yet to get my photos developed.I love the camera, but it does have a few disadvantages. First, there is no view finder, which I didn't think would be a big deal, but it makes taking pictures on sunny day more difficult.

I have played with this for several days now editing the photos, paling with the on-board and the computer imaging package, and I see nothing wrong with this camera for an everyday average user like me. And with it's weather resistence, nice for a clumsy average user like me. Also the battery life is very adequate, about 120 photos or more, with slide shows, editing ect... This is well worth the investment, saving your families memories in a fit and proper manner.I also highly recommend the Stylus 810 if you have the extra money.  It is on clearence at most chain stores at this time, so the price has dropped, but the thing that kept me from buying it instead of this 710, I had a coupon.

During the 2 years that I have owned it, it has proven to be a fairly dependable camera. General performance was good although the indoor shots (with flash) and outdoor action shots (i.e. kids playing soccer) could have been better. For some reason, any indoor shot with flash that involves the zoom always ends up dark and blurry, so it's pretty much a given that if I use my zoom and my flash indoors, I will get blurry pictures. Macro shots with a flash aren't that great either.  Nevertheless, I've been fairly happy with it........until a couple of weeks ago.  While taking pictures during our beach vacation, I was appalled when my camera stopped working. In the midst of taking shots, I got this odd whirring sound, the lens popped in and out, then the LCD screen turned blue.  An error message: \"D : 5f 08 5e 02\" appeared on the screen and my camera stopped working.  I was able to view the pictures I had taken, but the same whirring/lens popping/blue screen thing happened each time I tried to take a picture.All this within 2 1/2 years of purchase!!  So this camera is dead and it would cost me almost as much as a new camera to have the problem fixed.  I find it completely unacceptable for a camera to stop working this quickly (I had a manual point-and-shoot Canon Sureshot back in the day which lasted 10 years and counting!).

The absence of a viewfinder is problematic in very bright light situations, but I rarely used the viewfinder in previous cameras.

The CD software that comes with it is kinda slow and antiquated....however the redeye removal works pretty good.

It is capable of getting some truly great shots and many of my photos look professional quality. I will spend more time on the downsides of the camera than the up, because it seems like the reviews are innundated with positive reviews already. And the camera certainly does have its drawbacks. Granted, I was a fairly heavy user, spending weeks in the rainforest and on fine, sandy beaches, hiking and doing other activities.First off, the LCD screen cracked, which isn't a huge deal, but some other reviewers may say it is very hard to do... it's not that hard. Next, other parts did come loose, although they didn't fall off, and made the camera a little harder to use. Although it is marketed as weather-proof, a better term is slightly weather resistant. It couldn't seem to get a decent photo off in the rain, even when we stumbled on a tapir, quite a rare sight.The zoom is practically worthless, but better than nothing, I suppose. On all of my pictures, I have to adjust the color saturation because the camera's normal pictures are somewhat dull-colored compared to real life; not a big deal, really, just an extra hassel. The \"mode\" settings suck, rare does one actually give you what you want. Night pictures are impossible, it is very hard to set the camera to a slow enough shutter speed to turn out with a good picture. The camera has an incredibly hard time in bad lighting (into sun, cloudy skies, etc), though so do all cameras, however, this one seems a little bit worse than most.After saying so many bad things, I feel a little guilty, the camera really is pretty good overall. It is slim and easy to carry around. The quality is great, as long as the lighting is good. The macro is amazing.Bottom line: I just want you all to realize the drawbacks it has before buying.

All my friends liked it for its looks, sleek features and all-weather shell.Apart from looks this camera stands up to the Olympus reputation. I had read all the reviews before purchasing the camera. It makes an excellent buy. Snaps are perfect. As a matter of fact, it is so easy to operate that I will buy it for my parents (or probably hand them over this one).I cant really say this as a problem, but ONCE the camera did not recognize the XD picture card. My card was loaded with some 150 snaps and I was taking another Super-High Quality pic. When the snap was getting recorded, it just gave this error message. I switched off the camera and swithced it on again, it gave the same error message. Then I took out the battery and removed the card and re-assembled the whole thing, it started working fine. BUT I CANT SAY THAT IT IS A REGULAR FEATURE. It may have been one odd case.Else this camera is just superb. Buy it if you can afford it. I have a few friends who got cheaper versions from other manufacturers. And they repent buying those cameras.Expensive purchase will trouble you once (with $$$s) but a cheap purchase will trouble you many more times. So make that little extra expense.Ok, enough of publicity for Olympus.*************************************************************************My second review just before Thanksgiving break:I have been using this camera for over 16 months now. It was impressive when I bought it (as I had done enough research) and the camera looked impressive as hell being bright blue in color. Many of my friends complimented me on this camera. It takes good pictures during natural light. I must admit however that there are certain problems with the camera. Firstly, after a year of use the lens doesn't open up completely. I have to switch the camera on and off. Since the warranty has expired (and I have read the reviews), I am not going to bother about it till it finally gives up on me.The images during low-light conditions haven't been very satisfying (I like Sony Cybershot for that matter). Some people have complained about red eye. That can be shut off and brightness can be increased by increasing the using the low light mode option. The picture come a bit yellowish then, but it not bad at all.I have used this camera in rains (but never dared it being dipped in pool) and hence I can confidently say that it is weather proof. However, ensure that the camera lids are shut tight(esp the one for transferring images).The biggest drawback of this camera is that it has an awesome video mode, but you cannot zoom in while recording. So, you have to decide beforehand what level of zoom you need for entire video. How stupid!!I bought this camera when it was for $245 and now it is priced at $145. Even the harshest of depreciation methods also cannot justify how the price eroded so quickly. My guess is that technology is coming up far more quickly.My recommendations -  Wait for a while and go for a really nice camera instead of cameras in this range. If you are really desperate, go for Canon SD1000. It is still like a time tested piece. And please for heaven's sake, do not shop from Best Buy and all. Go there to see the camera and test it. But buy it from Amazon. Even the thanksgiving sale at best buy cannot match regular prices of Amazon.", "Date": "November 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Replacement", "Author": "Norma Sanchez \"burgundy_sky\"", "ReviewID": "R36ABP4AN15D4O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about six months and I still find new features to play with.

If you are wanting a high-end quality digital camera with similar features of an SLR camera and are willing to pay big bucks, then you should probably look elsewhere. However, as has been said previously, there are a plethora of features on this camera, and after a year, I still don't know what many of them are. Yet, for an everyday, high quality, point-and-shoot camera, this is a great camera.It is small, versatile, and gets the job done for most lighting situations. If you are too close to a subject, the flash can be a problem, but I usually turn off the flash or change the setting to macro (I think the camera automatically turns off the flash for the closest macro).The weather resistant feature is nice and I have used it several times in a light rain before with no problems to functionality. I have also dropped it and it still works as well as the day I bought it. The screen is large which is a big plus.One thing about this camera that I do not like (hence the 4 stars) is that it does not automatically take 4x6 pictures. When getting prints, you have to crop or examine almost all the pics to make sure nothing gets cut off. For sharing photos on the web or through e-mail, obviously this is not a problem. The other thing is taking night pictures. It has taken me a year to figure that out and still they are not as good as I would like.My favorite feature is the continuous shooting mode. You can get carried away with that little feature. My second favorite feature is the image stabilization. Even when your hand and the subject are moving, you can get clear shots. I have never had a problem with the battery life. I can fill up a 1GB card (about 200 pics at highest MP setting) until its time to recharge the battery. The little USB slot is tiny and kinda hard to get to, but with practice it takes little effort and mine is still there (hasn't fallen off).

It is small, flashy and caught my eye as a handy little camera that would suffice for general point and shoot photography.First I read the Quick Start and installed the software in my iMac G5.  This should have been my clue as to what was ahead.  The software went in and a window came up that a software upgrade was available.  I clicked to update and the window it was downloading, but then Olympus Master froze necessitating a \"Force Quit\" of the Master Software.  I tried unsuccessfully at least four times to no avail.  Then I tried to send an email from the program.  Again, wrong.  Instead of opening my default email program, it opened the OSX Mail program.  I use Eudora 6.2 with all my other programs.Then on to the camra.  It was then that I discovered that in order to recharge the battery, you must remove it and place it in the charger.  My Fuji had a cradle to recharge and to download.  The Stylus 710  must have a USB cable connected to the camera, and to the computer in order to download to the computer.  That is after you realize you need a tool in order to open the little door to access the USB port.  I will be nice and not mention the xd card fits flush in its socket making it necessary to have a decent fingernail to push down to lock/unlock it.Now for the pictures:1)  The quality of the pictures in the \"Auto\" mode is primitive at best.  Probably OK for someone that doesn't take a  lot of pictures.  Undeer ideal conditions, good light and a quiet subject the picture would be acceptable.2)  In semi sunlight, cloudy in mid morning, the flash goes off for a normal picture.  Where is the auto ISO?  The pics were \"OK\" at best, being nice the Olympus.3)  DON'T plan on previewing photos taken outside in sunlight.  I couldn't see the LED screen - just hoped for the best.  (It does make a great mirror.)4)  Indoor flash were acceptable.5)  I took a number of photos under the same conditions within 20 minutes of each other on both cameras.  The Olympus lost in all cases.  It was like the \"thrilling days of yesteryear\" when you took your roll of film from your trusty Kodak Brownie and hoped for the best.Needless to say, the camera is going back.  I might caution anyone else looking for a \"cute, simple\" camera, this is for you.  Just don't plan on those \"oooooh\" pictures.  It would seem that most of the camera manufacturers have eliminated the eye view finder, the cradle, and ease of operation.  Even the new Fuji's have gone to the larger LED screen which is also lousy in bright sunlight.", "Date": "June 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "A GR8 CAMERA FOR POINT&SHOOT;", "Author": "crime stopper \"crime stopper\"", "ReviewID": "R1XI3X6J7B3JWF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'M REALLY ENJOY THE QUAILITY, VERSATILITY AND EASYS OF THIS CAMERA.

I would carry it in my pocket all the time and I still don't have any scratches on the huge LCD screen.  The picture quality is pretty nice, but it took me a while to learn about all the different settings so I could make sure I got the best quality in each situation (there are about 20 presets).  Only one bad thing has happened...my flash card completely stopped working after 2 months.  The camera had not been dropped or anything like that, and it was well taken care of.  The last few weeks of the trip is full of orangy looking, grainy shots because of that; I sent the camera off when I got back home and they replaced the flash board and now it's good again.  I think the best feature of the camera is the videos...I have gigs of videos to always remember my trip thanks to this camera.  BE SURE TO BUY A HUGE MEMORY CARD TO GO WITH THIS ONE (my pictures at SHQ come out to be around 3meg a piece and 1 meg per second on the videos).", "Date": "November 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "All the modes you need", "Author": "Marwan Abou Said", "ReviewID": "RC7YGNB71BI83", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought until now 3 of Olympus Stylus 710, one for me, and after using it i bought two for my two sisters, and eevrytime i bought one i went through all the brands and model, i couldn't find any with too many modes as this one, i had a Sony digital cam before and once it get a knock on the lence, it stop working, even in the store , the displayed one was the same probem , even it was a newer model than the one i had.and my advice you do not need too many pix. because it will be very hard to send them by email, and normaly i zip the file and with that also you can not send too many.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very easy to use best value for the money", "Author": "K. joe Soe \"KJS\"", "ReviewID": "R1F09WCY8CSFYN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found this Olympus to be very easy to use.
