{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LOVE this camera! Goes everywhere with me", "Author": "Observer", "ReviewID": "R41BN61UXWP3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a pro-sumer level photographer (very serious amateur who sometimes does professional work). This is my carry-with-me-everywhere camera. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this camera. So much that when I dropped the one I have had for 3 years I looked at all the newer cameras and replaced it with...the same model! Here's why:GOOD LOW LIGHT PICTURES-No low light, non-flash picture is going to be as good as one on a sunny day, but this camera takes some of the best. Fuji was working on a new technology here and seems to have forgotten about it in their newer models focusing on more pixels instead.PIXELS-8.3 is enough. Cramming more pixels onto the same size sensor does not make the pictures better: they just make the pixels smaller to make them all fit.  More pixels need more storage room on the computer. ( a lot of people only look at pixels and think more is always better, but this is not true. The newer models pander to this myth.) I don't want more pixels unless the camera has a larger sensor (which it doesn't).POCKET SIZE- This camera goes with me everywhere without being a burden. Once, on a paid photo shoot it even saved my skin by getting pictures my DSLR could not because I had not brought the right lens.FEATURES I LIKE: macro mode, snow mode (so snow scenes do not come out gray,  built in flash (which can be disabled or force fired), adjustable isoWISH- manual settings on the camera would be a nice. Sometimes I actually want a blurry picture but this camera does all it can to keep them focused, even at night from a moving car!GREAT FOR - always having with you, so you don't miss a good picture, parties, casual shooting, family events.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fiji Camera", "Author": "T.

Takes great shots in the evening - easy to change from one mode to another...especially if you have no special skills as a professional photographer!

There is no physical damage to the camera and it still looks brand new. When I called customer service they knew it was a problem because the CSR gave me a story of how he try to crack the LCD screen on a Fujifilm camera on his own. He succeed, and there was no physical damage to the LCD screen on the outside but the screen on the inside was cracked. On the whole, I think Fujifilm Camera Screens break very easily. They have to cut cost some where and they just used a cheap LCD screen. Don't buy any of their cameras stick with Canon or Nikon.Cosmicac", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "FinePix F45fd", "Author": "Busy7Mom \"Homeschool Momof7\"", "ReviewID": "R17LOOSCKKOSFM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I took the recommendation of a lady at a photo shop trying to sell the camera.  I have been unhappy with it because I am always getting red eye on my people photos.  The reason I bought it was to take photos of my 7 kids.
