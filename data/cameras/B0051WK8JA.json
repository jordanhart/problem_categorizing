The only flaw I found in it had to do with the default VGA resolution. If you have an older monitor you will not get a picture at first. You will need to connect this unit to a higher quality monitor and then decrease the resolution to something lower.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$109.99", "Features": "4 Channel H.264 Pentaplex Network DVR, 120FPS Realtime Display\nRealtime Recording, 1280*1024 VGA Output, Support D1\nRecording, 4 CH Playback, SATA HDD, Mobile Phone Surveillance\nCompact Form Factor", "Name": "LTS LTD7904 4 Channel H.264 Pentaplex Network D1 DVR", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/316vTPzt%2BiL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0051WK8JA"}}
