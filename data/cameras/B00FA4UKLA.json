{"Reviews": [{"Title": "AW1. Probably the best waterproof digital camera, but a mixed bag", "Author": "DanFried2", "ReviewID": "RPXGX8H4AO287", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been using the AW1 for a few days now and have found some very good things, and some not so good things about it. I should start by saying that I'm a professional photographer and use full frame and micro 4/3 cameras with high-end lenses. So, that's my point of reference. However, for family vacations that are often by a beach or lake, I have been using a Canon D10 which is now several years old and I've been searching for a higher-quality waterproof camera to replace it. The AW1 seemed like the ideal replacement - especially after reading the reviews of the new crop of rugged/waterproof cameras whose IQ is not any better than the old D10. So, I bought one as soon as they were introduced. I haven't tried it underwater, so my comments are based on landscape shots taken in bright light.  Also, I use DXO or ACR to process RAW images and neither have announced a profile for the AW1, so my comments are based on out-of-the-camera JPGs.First the Good (just the highlights):* Build quality is superb.  You could probably pound nails with this thing and not damage it. It feels solid as a brick (also weighs as much as a brick). Easily the most solid camera I've picked up in a long time.  It's a pleasure to hold.* Controls are smooth and positive in their action.* Pretty good results on Auto mode.  JPGs are fairly clean - certainly better than any of the much less expensive rugged cameras.  I haven't tried RAW yet because I use ACR, or DXO, and neither have announced a profile for the AW1.* Some nice features.  For example, Auto HDR works very well.* Amazing frame rate: 60fps* Super fast at everything: start-up is instant. Focus is instant. For all practical purposes, everything is instantaneous. Just a pleasure to use.* It actually comes with a paper Manual!  Kudos to Nikon for not following the idiotic trend to have all the meaningful documentation on a CD.  However, there's a more detailed reference manual that you can download.* The tilting feature to change modes works very well.  You could use it with ski mittens on.  Not sure how you'd press the shutter release, or turn the camera on while wearing mittens, but you'd be able to change modes.Now the Bad:* For a camera in this price class, the lack of image stabilization and a histogram display is simply inexcusable. This is a MAJOR omission. Especially, the lack of a histogram. Why have exposure compensation if you don't have a histogram display so that you can see the effect of the adjustment. I'd have given it 4, or maybe 5 stars if it weren't for this omission. My old D10 has both IS and a histogram display and that camera cost $250.* No over/under exposure indication. What's with that Nikon? Even much less expensive cameras have things like flashing areas to indicate blown highlights.* Image quality is good, but doesn't have the same level of detail as images shot with a micro 4/3 camera and a good lens. The AW1 is 14MP and m4/3 is 16, which will not account for the difference. So, I suspect that the kit zoom is of only fair quality. I don't think that the lens is capable of bring out the best in the sensor. That said, it's still better than the compact rugged/waterproof cameras. Maybe Nikon will offer a better zoom in the future.* It's clearly designed for point & shoot users who will simply leave it on Auto. There are too many menus to scroll through to change settings for the Creative mode. However, Auto works very well and, I suspect that if I'm in a situation where I'm snorkeling, or something where a waterproof camera is required, I'm not going to want to be fiddling with menus - Auto will be used a lot for that.* No programmable function button, or any other programmable features.  Why not?  Why can't I set the Movie record button to HDR, or some other function?  This is just firmware.Not necessarily a negative, but something to think about: It's very heavy and will sink like a brick.  NO floatation strap from any manufacturer that's designed for a camera will keep it afloat and Nikon hasn't released one designed for the AW1.  You need 2-3 ordinary floatation straps (depending on the strap) before it will be buoyant. Some divers prefer their equipment to have slightly negative buoyancy.  My preference is for slightly positive buoyancy so that if I drop it in deep water, it doesn't sink to the bottom - which could be more than 49ft deep.Another omission, which I suspect will be at least partially rectified in the future.  The lens has threads for a filter, and a rubber gasket around the outside of the front of the lens. I believe that it is Nikon's intent to release a filter that screws in and with a flange that seals against that rubber gasket to prevent water from getting between the filter and the lens. But, that filter isn't available.  So, you have to be very careful not to damage that rubber gasket so that when they do release the filter, it will seal properly.  Of course, it's also possible that the thing I'm calling a gasket is really a bumper and part of the drop protection.  Also, there's no way to attach a lens hood.Overall, it's a good, but not great camera. I expected better. The firmware is v1.0, so maybe some of the issues, like the lack of a histogram will be addressed by future updates. And, hopefully, if the system proves popular, Nikon will introduce a better quality waterproof zoom lens.  In the mean time, as it is, and short of a more expensive camera in a waterproof housing, it's the best you can get for your trip to the beach.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Truly amazing camera.", "Author": "D. Markle", "ReviewID": "R31R3AMBJJLEA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's hard to give anything 5 stars, but this camera is nothing short of phenomenal.  This camera is the only game in town, as of late 2013, which can take high quality action shots but doesn't cost many thousands of dollars.My primary use for this camera is taking kitesurfing pictures.  That means it's exposed to freezing cold (yes we kitesurf in the winter), and it's immersed in salt water.  The pictures coming out of this camera, with no manipulation, are amazing.  There simply is no other  ruggedized action camera that can hold a candle to this, especially at this price point.  I've been through two waterproof cameras so far, a Pentax WG-3, and a Canon waterproof point and shoot.  I was disappointed in these.  They took noisy pictures, and their advertised wide apertures only worked when you were far away from the subject.  Zoomed in, they missed the subject or blurred out almost every time.I paired this camera with the kit zoom lens, and took some photos on full auto which took my breath away when I put them on a large monitor:[...]I also got the NIKKOR 32mm f/1.2 lens for dry-land portrait shots, and am similarly blown away by the quality.Loves:The battery lasts respectably long and I don't feel I need to have a spare.  The flash only pops up when you tell it to.  The image quality is amazing.  Even when it gets grainy in really low light, it has a film-like grain to it.  The colors are amazing out of the camera, with no extra processing needed.Gripes:I couldn't care less about GPS.  I'd rather have built in Bluetooth to control the camera through my smartphone.  I'd rather have built in WiFi to transfer the images out of the phone without taking the bloody card out.  It's crazy that this isn't built in.  With the 32mm f/1.2 lens, the camera takes truly amazing video, but the fact that I can't put a better microphone on it really stinks.  Again, this would be an awesome use case for bluetooth.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Ximena C.", "ReviewID": "R18MPKQ1F7LY2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've really enjoyed my camera, I used it during my vacations to orlando and got a chance to test underwater at the waterpark, it was good to be able to take pictures and film underwater and at the same time dont worry about the shocks. I've been a very unlucky person with devices all my life, usually nothing lasts too long before breaking in my hands, but this camera i think will survive. Im not a pro so I cannot say much about the quality of the pictures, i like them but im not amazed, maybe if i knew how to use it better i could achieve better results. The battery lasted long enough everyday from start to end, and I did took a many pictures. Only \"bad\" thing I would say is the weight, it is heavy but you get used to it quickly. I love this camera and probabbly will keep on this line of cameras if nikons comes up with new ones.Also its nice to be worryless and be able to enjoy the moments without even thinking to put your camera away for it to be safe, with this camera you will never have to put it in a safe place,", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Won me back after the AW100 lackluster experience", "Author": "Rpak", "ReviewID": "RFDO0UUOYEEIL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I\u2019m a Nikon owner, currently D800, D300S, several Nikkor lenses, going back many years to my D80 days. I did venture to Canon with the waterproof D10 only because at the time Nikon, did not have a similar point-n-shoot for my beach and outdoor activities where a DSLR was not practical. I must say, the D10 was a good camera with decent IQ for a point-n-shoot, both above and below the water. When Nikon came out with the AW100, I bought one because, well, I\u2019m Nikonian by heart and using the D10 seemed wrong (LOL). The AW100 was a big disappointment compared to the Canon D10. Image quality of the AW100 was bad! But this is about the Nikon 1 AW1, so I will not go into details about that. I just wanted to preface this review with my AW100 experience because it made me VERY hesitant to buy the AW1, even though they are really totally different cameras (point-n-shoot vs interchangeably lens / mirrorless). I took the risk and bought one after doing some research and reading \u2018professional\u2019 reviews. I have been using the Nikon 1 AW1 since November 2013. I have used it on the cold beaches and wetsuit temperature waters of Southern California (November), and in the tropical, very warm and humid beaches of Boracay Island, Philippines (December 2013). I am so pleased and actually very surprised at the IQ and overall performance of the AW1. The images I have are sharp and the colors are true. Infinitely better than the AW100. For the ruggedized outdoor class of cameras, the AW1 is amazing. I no longer feel the need to bring my D800 and take chances with it to places where the AW1 was made for \u2013 active, outdoor, wet, sandy, dusty places. No need to \u201cbe careful\u201d all the time as I am with the DSLRs - just drop the AW1 in a backpack and go! The picture quality is really good enough for me to not even ponder about taking the D800 - i can depend on the AW1 to take good pictures. And compared to the AW100, you have much more creative control. Plus there are few new fun features too, like color selection, miniaturization, etc, that give you more creative control in real-time so no need to post process for the same effects. I have the FT1 adapter (from my Nikon 1 V1 which I traded in for this), so I\u2019m going to check out the image quality later using my FX Nikkor lenses (not underwater of course\u2026haha). Really happy with this purchase. A great compliment camera for my DSLRs.Only one small gripe \u2013 wish it could go deeper than 15m. Most of the dive sites on Boracay had a max depth under 14m. But if/when I dive in Southern California (like Catalina), where boat dives already average 15+ meters, I\u2019m out of luck. I don\u2019t dive as much anymore and spend most of my time on the sand, snorkeling or surfing, so this was not really a show stopper for me.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "What's worse--camera not waterproof or warranty worthless?", "Author": "jowct", "ReviewID": "R205Y8G8FANXOA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased an AW1 from Amazon with great hopes for Caribbean underwater photography. Before leaving home in CT, carefully followed all the instructions (even further saturated the body \"o\" ring with silicone), locked down the hatches (both times) and rotated the lens until locked. Then when emerging from the water, had a problem with apparent condensation inside the LCD viewfinder indicating a possible leak even though the camera was never more than 10 feet underwater. Upon return from vacation, sent it to Nikon for warranty repair (well within the warranty period) and had them come back with a $900+ estimate for repairs with nary an explanation as to why they ignored the warranty (I subsequently spoke with them and they responded that, \"Only the outside of the camera is warranted to be waterproof, not the inside\"--my responding that had the outside had been waterproof, the inside did not need to be, did not cut any ice.After finding the body returned to me by mail (to my astonishment), I drove to Nikon's Melville site where I was told for the first time that they had tested the camera, determined it to be waterproof, and therefore I must have caused the damage by allowing sand to compromise the seals. Responding that the lens was never off the camera after leaving my home until the LCD clouded up only appeared to harden Nikon's resolve.So now, with no warranty coverage, I have a $1,000 camera and several lenses most suitable as paperweights.Next step, the Better Business Bureau and Consumer Protection Agency.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "10 Dives in Bali 0 - 62 ft", "Author": "Daniel LaForce", "ReviewID": "R3IUVUBUMYIMBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used three cameras previously for underwater photography.  All compact Canons with housings rated to 300 ft.Just returned from a 6 day 10 dive safari in Bali.  I used the Nikon 1 AW1 for all dives.  Standard dive profile was to run along a line approximately 40 feet deep or shallower depending on the location of items of photographic interest.  On one dive the item was Pygmy Seahorses that occurred at the 53 ft level so we took the risk and exceeded the 49 foot spec.  The final photos show the shots were taken at 62 feet (as I understand it, the camera is not warranted against flooding, so its not like I could void the warranty).  A note in this regard -- I saw the review from the guy whose camera flooded in spite of the fact he put extra lubricant on the seals etc.  The camera was new out of the box and I had removed the lens once and put it back on immediately.  I wanted to keep it as close to factory shipping specs as possible since I fully intended to push the depth limitations during the Bali trip.  I did not put lubricant on the seals or mess with the camera in anyway except to change batteries and insert the memory card.I have been a still photographer for more than 40 years using a range of high end cameras.  I experimented with video briefly a few times over the years but did very little with the genre.  The 1 AW1 converted me to video in one easy step.  The camera is so light weight and easy to use (relatively speaking) that video was a logical next step. After a still photo is taken, a short video of the same subject becomes a logical extension of the process -- the camera makes this a very smooth and natural transition; since most of the shots were of coral reef animals, the opportunity to get animated video was too good to pass up.The best and the worst things about the camera:Best1.  Switching between video and still photos was as easy as pressing the appropriate button.  No settings to change, no dials to rotate.2.  1080p video with a preset underwater filter to reduce the blue.  Excellent video quality-- the camera often seems to have better visibility (visual distance penetration through the water) than my underwater vision (my eyes are 20/20).  I have killer video of two manta rays (at manta point -- somewhat murky water) that show them very nicely and much clearer than I saw them as I took the shots).3.  14.2  photos in vivid color.4.  Pop up flash works well at short ranges normal for underwater photography (but of course only for still photography).5.  Zoom lens range is pretty effective for the distances normal to underwater photography.6.  Scuba filter setting -- USE IT.7.  Camera is so compact and well engineered it, at times, feels like an extension of your eyes (when they aren't awash in seawater) and makes photography/videography an extension of seeing.8.  The Bali dive master observed at one point that other divers using the GoPo would shoot a few seconds of video and run out of memory.  I went to Bali with a 64 GB card in the camera and a second spare 64.  After shooting for 10 dives and early 800 photos and videos, 20 GB remained on the original card.  I never touched the second card.Worst1.  Make sure you have a separate charged battery for each dive.  Battery life is adequate but distinctly limited.  Change batteries between each dive.2.  Hierarchical menus are well organized but contain a lot of information so it took me a bit of experimentation to find the scuba setting and other specific options of interest.3.  I would estimate that one third to two thirds of the time I found it difficult to impossible to see the photo subject clearly in the display screen. At least half the time I settled for centering the moving blur in the center of the view field. The most common reason for this was a combination of saltwater washing around in my mask (and in my eyes) and the fact that as bright as the display screen on the camera was, the intense tropical sun and great Bali water clarity rendered the display a bit too dark to see well.  The standard camera limited angle of view was also a major factor.  Keeping a moving fish lined up in the view finder, while maintaining neutral buoyancy is an art that worked well sometimes and not at all others.  More than once I found my self vertical, head down in the water attempting to hold station on a group of tiny fish darting in and out of a coral head.4.  Because of the factors listed in 3 it would be good if the camera had motion control.  However, the improvements offered by this feature would probably be limited since keeping a moving fish centered in the view finder often requires swinging the camera in a wide arc.  The resulting video leaves much to be desired for a second or two until you can settle on the moving objects new track.  I suspect the arc would not be smoothed by standard camera shake reduction technology.I used the camera on a L shaped mount bar with one Sola 1200 underwater video light mounted to the bar on ball pivots and oneSola 1200  light mounted to the back of my right hand.Lights were a bit a a pain at times because it took 3 pushes up to set each at max illumination, and because the water clarity and tropical sun, overwhelmed the light put out by the units (recall I was usually at 40-45 feet or less).  Deeper dives would have made the lights more useful but also exceed the camera spec.  I would estimate the lights were only useful when shooting a relatively motionless subject (for example: clown fish in an anemone) within 2-10 feet.The light mount bar was a great aid in positive camera handling.  I suspect tracking a moving fish, with the camera only, might have made the camera seem a little too compact and the controls too close together.  By holding the mount handle in my left hand and controlling the camera with my right (zoom and video/photo button) control was never an issue.In summaryI have approximately 800 still and 1080p video segments. Nearly all are in focus and beautifully exposed.  As you can probably tell I let the camera manage the focus and lighting, so I could concentrate on tracking the moving subject while maintaining neutral buoyancy.  That was a full time job; sometimes, more than a full time job.  Over the next few weeks I intend to put a best of video together and upload to UTube.

I considered a number of options including the olympus, sony and panasonic mirrorless cameras.  I'm not a professional photographer, but I enjoy photography and I have a young daughter who provides me ample photo opportunities.  I go on many beach vacations and I have owned quite a few waterproof compacts, the sony cybershot, olympus tough and finally the olympus tg-2.  They all worked okay, but the focus speed and image quality were not quite what I wanted.  When the AW1 was announced I was quite intrigued.  Despite a number of less than stellar reviews for the Nikon 1 system, there were a few reviews from folks who really, really liked the system.Based on those reviews, plus the fact that I was just looking for an upgrade to image quality and a better selection of lenses, I decided that I would purchase the AW1.  As it happened I was going up to Portland, OR to visit family.  Since there is no sales tax up in Portland I went into a camera store on October 15, and they happened to have it in stock so I purchased it (with the waterproof 11mm-27.5mm zoom) as well as the 30-110 mm zoom and the 18.5 mm prime.  The last two are not waterproof but give me a good range of choices.Since then I have shot about 200 photos with the camera.  The images are definitely better than those that come out of any of the current crop of waterproof compacts that I have used.  In good light, the focus speed is lightning fast, allowing me to miss fewer shots when taking photos of my daughter running around.  In lower light conditions, the focusing is not nearly as fast and requires a lot more patience.  When photographing my daughter or other moving subjects I tend to shoot in shutter priority mode, preferring fast shutter speeds to low ISO or long depth of field.  I find that there is very little grain up to about 800 ISO, beyond that there is grain but pretty well controlled and not at all objectionable.  I have a few shots at 1600 ISO that have some grain but are perfectly acceptable for my purposes.In terms of negatives, yes, it would be nice to have a viewfinder, it would also be nice to have a larger sensor and a few more manual controls.  One other more serious issue is that battery life is okay, but not as long as I would like.  For a few hours at the beach it is okay, but all day requires an extra battery.  But all that said and done, those are relatively minor issues tradeoffs given what I get in return.Ironically, I have not done any underwater shooting with the camera.  That will probably end up waiting for sometime next year when I go on vacation.  In summary, I have really enjoyed shooting with this camera.  Image quality is good, focus speed is either a lot better (in good light) or somewhat better (in low light conditions) than all of the compacts I've used, and the available lenses are decent.  I'm probably a perfect candidate for this camera since I enjoy water sports, I have a kid and I like to travel.  The convenience of having one system that works in all of these cases makes the AW1 a very attractive option.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "The only camera I've ever 5 starred.", "Author": "Peter Witham", "ReviewID": "R3P87SSRO3G68C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only camera I've given a 5 star too, including all the DSLR's I own/owned.

Its not meant for dives beyond 50 ft and the light at that point would have changed underwater. So a dive cam is a better for that. This cam is for family pics in beaches, snorkeling, island hopping or in any condition that you expect your camera to get wet yet still keep getting shots. 2 hours after water activity i went rappelling with the same camera.. started to condense on the lens (not the cameras fault as i should have soaked it in water in between dives) but as soon as this was settled the resolution was equal to an average dslr with minimal change in camera settings. I am not a pro in photography but just an enthusiast and have had 4 dslr (2 of alpha of sony and 2 of nikon) and this one was equally good with its current lens. the settings can be adjusted easily either in motion or menu (large icons easy to shift underwater).The technicals will be dealt by the pros who will review this camera.

However, I discovered a significant flaw when I used it to shoot a local parade.  The ambient air temperature was 75 F, but the camera may have been a bit hotter as I was sitting in the sun.  However, it was only warm to touch.  What was the big problem?  It would give a brief message telling me that the internal temperature was too high and then shut off. Not exactly what you would want for an outdoor camera.  If they can fix this problem I would definitely give the camera a higher rating.

It goes beyond weather sealed as it is actually water proof and can be submerged underwater.  It will produce as good of image as any of the Nikon 1 Series Cameras.  It's also built to handle shocks and extreme temperatures.  It has a built in GPS which is great for those who are active and travel to extreme locations.  It can also use other quality Nikon 1 lenses.  Still, is it for everyone?  It would be if it cost around $500.  For $800, I don't think I would casually use it.  I would most likely baby it which will be meaningless to the word rugged.  Also, it only has two lenses currently that will make the camera waterproof.  Those lenses will not work with other Nikon 1 cameras.  I doubt Nikon will make all their lenses with this camera in mind or create AW version of the current lenses.  Lastly, Waterproof seal fails as time passes.  The seal quality looks really good, but I would still be afraid of my $800 camera every time I submerge with this camera versus a cheap AW point and shoots.  Question is how often will you be needing the rugged and waterproof features of this camera.  Normal person doesn't \"need\" this camera.  It's definitely cool, but it's not necessary.  Normal person will be better of getting a V2 rather than this camera and get a cheap AW point and shoot for rare occasions they need a AW camera.  This camera is for those active people who are constantly in extreme weather and doing extreme things getting extreme pictures.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thoroughly regret this purchase", "Author": "Jennifer Ferguson", "ReviewID": "R39FWPGKGCYJDV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased with intentions of photographing my daughter during softball tournaments.
