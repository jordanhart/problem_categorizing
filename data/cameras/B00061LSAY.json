{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Quality Alternative", "Author": "R. Auger", "ReviewID": "R3IPVVJJLDQ6D9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Introduction As an advanced hobby photographer, I often compete in galleries in my area.  I normally shoot with 35mm and medium format, and I scan the negatives and edit them in Photoshop CS.  I hesitantly took the plunge into the world of digital SLRs several months ago, and the *ist ds exceeded my expectations.  Like any camera, you will need to learn how to get good photographs out of it; it won't take them on its own.  I print everything on the i9900 Canon large format printer.  The following review should help decide if this camera is for you:Size and Weight The most noticeable advantage of the Pentax is its size and weight.  I don't have small hands, but the competition makes them too bulky and heavy (some may disagree), sometimes with buttons out of reach.  You can program the buttons on digital SLRs to do different things, but only the ds has the buttons within reach to be useful when shooting.  For instance, the \"ok\" button can be pressed to temporarily switch to manual focus.  Many people with other digital SLRs buy a separate smaller digital camera to use normally, which in my opinion, defeats the purpose of buying the SLR, since you'll end up almost never using it.  But the Pentax is small and light enough to carry around normally, such as to a party or on vacation, especially now that they created the super slim 40mm lens that weighs next to nothing.Outdoor Picture Quality and RAW format For artistic shots, I always use the RAW format, which Adobe recently updated for the RAW plugin.  Blowing up these shots to 13x19, I have found them to be quite sharp and clear.  Keep in mind that I have read several books in Photoshop, and like in the darkroom, it takes skill to get quality prints out of any media. I mostly shoot outdoors, and have been impressed at how balanced shots come out in harsh lighting.  Even if the sky is partially blasted out, the highlight/shadow option in Photoshop brings them right back in, with virtually no loss in detail in the clouds.  Realize that this is not the case with the 8-bit JPEG format, which doesn't blow up nearly as well.  For quality prints, you'll need to use the RAW mode, which maintains the sharpness and color detail. The biggest picture difference in other SLR's and the DS is that Pentax calibrated the camera to interpret with a more neutral color balance.  Some may feel disappointed by this, but from an advanced editing perspective, this is a blessing.  It allows me to have total control over the photo.  If the camera has oversaturated an area from the beginning, and you need to do an adjustment, there may be a lack of detail in that area afterward.  The Pentax appears much more natural looking, and with minimal adjustments from the Adobe RAW plugin, you can easily make the photos look exactly how you want.  With my Canon i9900 printer, which tends to print vivid photos, the combination produces realistic, vivid photos, not oversaturated and cartooning images. Even objects far away and in deep shadow areas have been quite clear and detailed, and overall, I have been extremely satisfied with the picture quality.  When blowing up photos to 13x19, make sure to use \"bicubic smoother\" when increasing the resolution size.  I have found that this completely eliminates any type of stairstepping that may occur.  I had the opportunity to compare with a friend 8mp Canon SLR, and found no difference in sharpness of the image.  I also found there was less noise in my camera (we both took them side by side of the same landscape).Indoor Photography I have only done this in personal situations combined with the 360 FGZ flash, which is a fantastic unit.  The bounce flash works perfect automatically, with uniform and realistic lighting.  Red eye has also not been a problem.  The built in flash, like with most SLRs, is just a backup, and works O.K. Unlike the *ist d, the *ist ds doesn't connect directly to the wireless flash units.  If you have a wireless flash unit like the 360 FGZ, however, it will connect to other wireless flash units.  I have not had the chance to test this out myself.Portrait Photography Flesh tones are realistic and pleasing, and hair maintains detail when enlarged.  This of course, depends on the lens used, but most results have been surprising pleasing, especially compared with 35mm color and medium format color film.  I still, however, prefer B+W film for portraits, but when I shoot in color, I have come to prefer the digital. Against harshly lit backgrounds, shots have come out surprising evenly lit and vibrant.Night Photography Long exposures, also during the day, come out quite sharp, especially after the new firmware update that corrects some issues with night shots.  The camera is well programmed to handle night photography, and it usually is close to the correct exposure.  The camera also has the ability to lock up the mirror 2 seconds before the exposure to minimize camera shake.Focusing The actual rotating speed is slower than my 35mm SLR, but this camera is more deliberate and actually gets to the correct focusing spot faster.  Red dots inside blink to show where the lens is focused.  The 16 segment metering is impressive, and I have found myself rarely using the manual focus option.  Even when shooting birds in trees, the focusing system doesn't get distracted by the braches. In action mode, the camera switches to a continuous focusing system, which has been very reliable for action shots, such as sports or when people are walking toward you.  This feature only works in action mode, however.Custom Settings and Ease of UseYou can program the buttons to do extra functions while in shooting mode.  For instance, the OK button can be used to temporary switch off the autofocus or to use center metering.  Make sure to go through the easy to read manual and the custom settings menu, since you will find some important features, such as changing the color to Adobe RGB instead of sRGB. Nothing is \"hidden\" on the camera, and everything is easy to use and quick to locate.  The well written manual is worth reading front to back, and gives useful information.  The custom features require some knowledge of how you like your camera to operate, and others require light technical knowledge.  Both beginners and advanced users will be satisfied with features and ease of use.The SD Chip and Camera Performance Make sure to buy a 60x chip, like the ATP which I have, or the SanDisk Ultra II.  I have tested the cheaper media, and they slow down the camera so that when the buffer runs out, instead taking 1.5 frames (I'm guessing) per second, its taking about 1 every 3 seconds.  The 60x chips really aren't that much more.  The SD chips aren't made quite as large and are more expensive than CP, but it contributes to making the camera smaller. The buffer is comparable to the competition, with almost 3 frames per second until it reaches about 8 or 9 and then slows down about half way.  In RAW mode, it will start slowing down at about 5 or 6 frames.  I have never had a problem where it didn't take the picture when I wanted it to.The Optional Included Lens For another $100, it is a useful lens, especially for personal shots in small rooms, where you'll need a wide angle zoom lens (and when you don't want to risk damaging a really expensive lens).  Its fairly light and compact.There is also a slim 40mm lens coming out soon, make sure to check it out on amazon.  Maybe you'll want to get this one instead, since other people will feel more at ease taking a picture for you.Batteries The camera used four AAs or two CR-V3.  I prefer this over a propriety battery, since when the battery dies, you can't just pop by Wal-Mart and buy more.  Also, with newer NiMH rechargeable AA's, you can buy batteries just as good, and use the same batteries as in your hotshoe flash.  With lithium AAs and CR-V3s, you can take over 400 pictures before the batteries die out, making it nearly impossible to have dead batteries on vacation.  And if you did, you can just pop by anywhere and get more.  I have not yet had a situation where my 2500mah rechargeables died on me.  I have heard that CR-V3 batteries fit rather tight into the compartment, but have not had this problem myself.Summary Overall, I've found the *ist ds quite impressive.  Even if you don't already have a collection of Pentax lenses, you'll find this camera to be a good alternative to the competition, with excellent build quality, easy of use, light weight, and compactness.  A large line of Pentax lenses will also impress you, but that is another discussion.  Although this hasn't replaced my other cameras, it has replaced my use of 35mm color film, since it's far sharper, with better color and detail. Like any other camera, it will take some time to learn how to get the best pictures possible out of it.  However, even beginners will find that quality results are easily possible.

Bailey \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "REO1Z74J0YMF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera about 4 months now, and I'm more satisfied than ever that I chose this over the Canon (20D) and Nikon (D70) that I tried for several days each.First I didn't even consider the Canon Rebel (other than picking it up for a few moments at the store).  The Rebel is cheaply built plastic, and feels like toy.  I'm sure it's more durable than it feels, but if I had bought the Rebel, I would have regretted it every time I picked it up.  Plus, why would you buy one when the Pentax is available for about the same price, and the Pentax feels much more like a professional camera should.I tried the Canon 20D and Nikon D70 for several days each before deciding to buy the Pentax.  First on the D20, there is no doubt that it is a better camera than the Pentax or the Nikon in several ways.  First SPEED.  The D20 is by far the fastest camera of the 3, and will take something over 5 frames per second I believe.  It focused very fast, and had very little noise, even at high ISOs.  However it is at least $600 more than the the Pentax or the Nikon, and I decided the extra fps speed was not worth it for what I need a camera for.  The Pentax is no slouch at 2.4 fps, and I've found that to be as fast as I need.Compared to the Nikon D70, both cameras take good pictures (the should, they both use the same 6.1mp Sony sensor), but I like several things about the Pentax better.  1st, the Pentax is a MUCH smaller camera, and I really didn't like the behemoth size of the Nikon.  If you've never held the Nikon, be sure to go to a store and try it first.  You won't believe how huge it is.  2nd, The LCD screen on the Pentax is bigger and brighter.  3rd the viewfinder on the Pentax is a pentaprism, which gives you a much larger and brighter image than the pentamirror (cheaper) on the Nikon.  4th, I like the menu system much better on the Pentax (much more intuitive). And finally, I like the fact that the Pentax uses SD memory as opposed to compact flash memory,  and it uses AA batteries (rechargeable) as opposed to a proprietary battery.Try the Pentax *ist DS, you will LOVE this camera.", "Date": "May 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Glad to be back with Pentax", "Author": "W.

I still own a Canon G3, but when the ist DS came out I was interested.I did my research on the Canon Rebel and the Nikon D70 and the Pentax and after all was said and done I chose the Pentax!  I am very happy with the camera.It is much smaller size than the others and seems very solid.  Pentax lenses are also cheaper than similar Canon and Nikon lenses (You are paying for their marketing efforts).  Also Pentax lenses from 30 years ago can be used with this camera.Pictures thus far are excellent and I work with it each day.

This camera is loaded with functionality and features that return such control, yet most of its functions can be learned in one sitting with its fantastically written user manual.If you are an old-school SLR shooter who wants to return to mastery of composition through control of aperature or shutter speed, this will get the job done.. It also offers typical autofocus/auto exposure/autoflash when you are just making snapshots.It's surprisingly lighweight. The controls and data information displays/interface are extremely user freindly. Some retailers are offering an additional aftermarket 70-300mm zoom lens in a bundle. Whether you purchase through them or this single lens offering via Amazon, you'll be doing high quality digital SLR shooting for about the cost of other DSLR bodies alone.The included software has some terrific features, including dual monitor support for slideshows.

Ham", "ReviewID": "RYA04UQGFD6T1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very very good camera for anyone considering a digital SLR.  Especially considering the price.  If you already own Pentax lenses, this should be an easy decision.This is my first digital SLR.  I've had Pentax and Sony digital point-and-shoot type cameras and Nikon Coolpix 8700.  Also, I've been using Pentax SLRs for past 20 years.Others have already detailed many reasons to buy this camera and dpreview has done a good job comparing the image qualities, but I should highlight the following advantages of ist DS:1.  Flexible power source.  ist DS can use AA batteries.  I use NiMH rechargeable AA batteries ... about $10 for 4 of them compared to $50 for proprietary batteries for Canon or Nikon SLRs.  But the fact that the camera can use AA batteries is great when I'm traveling.  Also, the fact that external flash light uses AA batteries make it easy in that you only need to worry about one type of batteries.2.  Sturdy and compact design.  The camera simply feels solid in my hands.3.  Good image quality.  Some have said and documented that the JPEG image isn't as good as Nikon or Canon because of the weap processing power within the camera.  BUT, if that's the concern, shoot in RAW format and use your computer to process the images.  If you are the type that don't want to bother with doing that much work, you probably won't notice the difference in JPEG image between ist DS and Nikons or Canons anyway.4.  Easy controls.  Controls are intuitive and easy to access/learn.  You won't need a manual to learn the controls.  (In contrast, Nikon Coolpix 8700's controls were simply difficult.  Really needed the manual for the camera.)5.  SD card rather than using Compact Flash card.  I like it because SD card is much more compact and easy to move it from the camera to the computer ... any computers.The 18-55 mm kit lens is worth it for the price.  If you buy a package, the price of the lens comes out to be under $100.  I think Pentax is planning on introducing 12~24 mm lens in about a year.", "Date": "August 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great to recycle my old Pentax lenses!", "Author": "Meha \"incognitomom\"", "ReviewID": "R30VBBEH23VU3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a Pentax fan from the SF-10 film days, I was delighted to see the Pentax *ist DS body at an affordable price.  Being into recycling from the early 70's, I was thrilled to be able to use  my Pentax 28-80 and 70-210 lenses, as well as my flash attachments and remote control.  Going from film to digital, the old lenses actually convert to about 45-100 and about 125-310.  Only sacrifice is a smaller wide angle, but makes up in the closeups!Easy to use both in automatic and manual modes, good color and depth of field.  For both the newbie and advanced phototgrapher, this camera offers it all.  Only 1 disadvantage would be the size if you are used to a small pocket digital camera - peronally, I love the size and balance.First photo (uploaded on this site) is of a hummingbird and a honeybee making a beeline for the hummer!

Unless you have some very specific needs from a dSLR when comparing features, this camera can win your heart easily.It is backward compatible with virtually every lense Pentax and third party companies have made for Pentax cameras. The viewfinder is comparable to that of the Canon 20D, and the DS really supports manual focusing unlike most other digital SLR's. The DL follows closely. The focusing screen can be swapped easily with an available 3 or 4 options to chose from, including one by a third party named Katz Eye Optics. I have heard good results with that split center microprism focusing screen as it allows you to manually focus better like the good old SLR days.The autofocus motor is a little slower than the competition, but it is highly accurate and offers eleven focus points to chose from. For most general purposes it is fast enough. The thing about Pentax is that it is not the best with one particular feature (except lense quality) but it can do everything very well. This makes it overal VERY good.The optical quality of Pentax lenses is as good if not better than the competition and at a lower price, perhaps from the lower demand from consumers. Nonetheless, even the kit lense blows away the competition.Noise level is not a factor, and in my opinion is controlled better than Canons and Nikons giving more of a resemblance to real film grain. Although, it is still much more usable at ISO 3200 than film cameras are.If you love to take pictures then get into Pentax. If you would rather have the most advanced technology and have the camera take the pictures for you, then look elsewhere but consider that Pentax will be soon coming out with possibly image stabilization integrated in a new 10 megapixel pro spec body, and an 18 megapixel medium format sensor camera at the end of 2006.The only downside at this point is that desirable Pentax lenses can be difficult to find, but they are coming out with some new models soon also.", "Date": "March 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Pentax DS 6 6.1 MP", "Author": "Digital Photographer \"Used to Like Nikon,s\"", "ReviewID": "R3REHYF79AF7O3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought mine this afternoon, since then I have been fooling around with it, it is terrific.Photos are just beautiful, color superb and very sharp.

I've been buying Pentax cameras almost every 10 years including Pentax-made HP point-and-shoot digital cameras .  Been waiting a while for Pentax to come through with an affordable dSLR in my price range and with the right features.  The time has finally come with the *istDS since Pentax is phasing them out and replacing it with *ist DS2 and *ist DL.When I compared the DS with DS2 and DL, I just could not see my self spending more money on DS2 for very little feature changes.  By the same token, I wasn't too crazy on the reduction of features on the DL especially the replacement of Pentaprism with mirrors. So the DS is the best choice for the money at this time.After using my *ist DS for a few weeks, I really fell in love with the camera as it rekindle my joy for photography. But there are a couple of things I wanted to mention to potential buyers who are considering this camera.1. The Pentax DA 18-55mm lens is almost useless for general situations.  It goes from wide to normal view only.  I would have preferred something like the Tamron 18-200 mm XR Di II lens that allows me to go from wide to normal to zoom.2. The built-in flash is weak and the pictures look cold and blue.  My point and shoot digital camera took better flash pictures then the *ist-DS.  Using my old Pentax TTL flash on the camera was a real improvement esp. with bounce flash.3. For the guys who want to use old Pentax lens and flash with this camera, that will only last for a short time until you consider how much lighter and smaller the new Auto-Focus lens that are available for the dSLRs.  Also, the newer P-TTL flashes works in conjuction with zoom level of your lens and can control slave flashes wirelessly.4. The Pentax *ist-DS camera case (O-CC28) is the perfect complement to the camera since it contains a pocket for the IR remote and lens cap.  However, you can not find them anywhere in the U.S..  The *ist-D case (O-CC10) does not fit the *ist-DS body.5. I was able to use the IR remote from my Pentax-made HP point and shoot.  This leads me to believe that any Pentax IR remote should be compatible with the *ist-DS camera.  There's a bunch of them out there on Ebay.  Pentax should include this with the camera as a freebie like all the point-and-shoot cameras.I gave 4 stars because some of the idiosynchrocies I mentioned above.", "Date": "December 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best dSLR within the Budget", "Author": "T.

Nikon D70 is another one if you don't mind its bulkier size.With this Pentax, you will get not only absolutely-beautifully-textured black metal body as Nikon but also a very big and very clear penta-prism (not mirror as in others) viewfinder.  Plus, you can always pop into a gas station to get four AA batteries in a pinch.  Its pictures in JPEG might not be as sharp as ones from Rebel.  What's the heck? For family photos, I use zoom lenses and don't even shoot in the best quality JPEG anyway.  If I really care about the image quality, I can always put on my 50mm and shoot in RAW, whose quality is as good as Rebel.Canon Rebel and XT are really plastic toys that happen to be able to take very good pictures.  Even my son's Nintendo GB feels more substantial than a Rebel!  Unlike an owner of Rebel, whenever you see a real camera from the same manufacturer, such as Rebel's bigger brothers, you won't curse yourself for being a few hundred bucks short and treated as a second-class customer by the manufacturer.Maybe I have been too harsh on Canon.  I guess the concept behind Rebels is not really camera per se.  They mean not to be really a serious photographic tool, rather another piece of consumer electronics---in fashion and easily disposable.

It's not so much whether you get one with 6.1 or 8 or 10 or 36 Megapixels (which dictates how humungous you want to go with prints.) I think a camera's quality depends upon the lenses.And don't underestimate the quality of your software -- your \"darkroom\" -- for improving, fixing, and playing with your photo images. NOTE WELL: The Pentax editing software -- at least, the version which came with my camera seven months ago -- is very disappointing. You'll probably want to find an alternative or two. If you use the Apple Mac version 10.xx operating system, the included iPhoto software offers helpful, basic edit tools (and the capacity to assist in sorting, cataloging, and making slideshows for viewing.

The 1stD body looked like a great replacement and the used price was reasonable. The only problem was it was advertised as accepting older lenses but didn't hint that a adapter was needed for the screw type lenses. The camera body was like new and after getting an adapter for the lenses, works beautifully.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "it just like the one stolen", "Author": "EDGAR N DECAMP", "ReviewID": "RY60V9UGC90QM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did not need to learn a new camera over and save me in pinch and works well and lot less newer model.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT & AFFORDABLE FULL SIZE DIGITAL CAMERA", "Author": "JOE   V", "ReviewID": "R149FNNBXAGXUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I HAVE A PENTAX ME-SUPER CAMERA AND SOME GREAT LENSES (WIDE ANGLE-TELEPHOTO-PORTRAIT) THAT I BOUGHT IN THE 80'S AND HAVE BEEN USING THIS 35MM FILM CAMERA FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.
