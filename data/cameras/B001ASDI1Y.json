I think they included the wrong driver, and I emailed VideoSecu about it and they sent a link with the updated software.EDIT (10/17/11): It looks like other reviewers are able to install the software from the CD just fine. It's been almost 2 years since I wrote this review so they better have fixed it by now...EDIT 2: You cannot get remote monitoring on smart phones with this model. Instead, you have to get the PCI DVR from Q-See: Q-See QSDT4PCRC 4 Channel H.264 PCI DVR Card They said it works with Win Mobile Pro, Symbian OS and iPhones.Once I installed that, it worked perfectly. The most awesome thing about it is you can control Pan/Tilt/Zoom functions and watch the live camera feed remotely. You can also download your recordings remotely (but be sure to use Internet Explorer, because the remote monitoring software requires ActiveX).The motion detection and alarm features are also very nice. You can make it record when motion is detected so you don't have the scrub through hours of recording nothing. You can also make it email you when motion is detected, and it can even attach a snapshot of what set off the motion alarm.The frame rate may stutter a lot when you are using more than two video inputs. You also want to be sure that if your cameras are wireless that there is a clean signal with no interference or disturbances. Any bit of interference will set off the motion alarm, and it will record nothing interesting (unless you find static fascinating).Another thing; the DVR software does NOT work on 64 bit systems (but the remote monitoring will).", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Crashed my PC and was hit with unlisted restocking fees on return", "Author": "SAV", "ReviewID": "R1HYQLVG9QOPFA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This looked like a great way to get live feeds from a number of cameras and there were a number of stars however I tried for over 2 days to get this to work without crashing my computer and eventually realized that it wasn't going to work for my system.  Every time I plugged it in my computer would beep for 10 seconds and eventually freeze (tried all of my USB ports with the same result).I decided to return the system and therefore contacted the seller.  They gave me a return authorization and told me that I needed to pay return shipping.  That was expected and so I paid return shipping.  Well about a week later I see that I only received a partial refund.  When I reached out to the seller to ask why they told me that there is a 20% restocking fee listed in their terms and conditions.  That's a load of crap.  I read through their entire policy including the return policy (which only references the Amazon return policy and says to call them with \"additional policies that may apply\").  The only place they mention a restocking fee (of 35%) is when a shipment is undeliverable or refused.  Neither of those applied in my case.Summary, I received something that crashed my computer and didn't work, I was able to return it but the end result was that I received back about 60% of what I paid (I lost out on shipping both to and from the seller as well as the unlisted yet very real restocking fee).  The entire experience left a bad taste in my mouth and helped to reiterate why I'm much better off buying only from Amazon (vs. an Amazon retailer) whenever possible.BTW, I noticed that the retailer raised the price after I bought my 4 Channel USB DVR. Guess with an unlisted 20% restocking fee they felt they were better off charging more!", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well worth the money", "Author": "Jeffrey Bryan", "ReviewID": "R2U7TZDYYV2WRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed this item to work quickly and efficiently - and it did!

I sent a message to warehouseseller on a Friday night about the issue, and within an hour received a message from a company rep. (julia), with a link to where I could find the drivers. Even though the product description mentioned that it was incompatible with Windows 7, I attempted it anyways. And guess what....it didn't work. I eventually had to install Windows Vista on my comp to get the item to work, and once it did, everything worked perfectly. There is a downside, as the only way the DVR will work is if your monitors resolution is at 1024 x 768. Using the remote software is also easy, all you have to do is enable it in the software settings, then log in to your router and enable portforwarding for the comp you're using, and then type in the IP address of your computer into an internet explorer window, and it should work after you install the activex components. not only can you watch live footage remotely, but also footage that was previously recorded.

I was actually impressed with the picture quality. The real downside to quality is the limited frame rate (best is only 30fps) so there are some problems with \"stepping\". If I was granted one wish amongst the improvement research team, it would be that the user not lose sight of video while adjusting settings. Instead, have the control panel come up in sidebar, rather than take up entire screen.Overall, this unit will not give the user tv quality video, but for documenting notes, traffic, and general surveillance, it should work just fine.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "would not buy again", "Author": "reader reader", "ReviewID": "RKUOGNGK8EG83", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Software is junk!

I tried the hardware/software I was sent on a multitude of different computers with the same unpleasant results.I wanted a simple solution for a video surveilence system -Running several cameras to a laptop. It is not practical to install a multi-channel DVR into a laptop, I figured that a USB device like this would be a good alternative.First a *WARNING* - if you order this item from 'WarehouseSeller', you will NOT recieve this item. You will recieve an \"Ezcap3104B\". This will come with knock-off software and drivers that are poorly translated from what is probably Chinese.WarehouseSeller told me that this was an 'upgraded' version, but this is, quite frankly, BS. It is clearly a cheap clone - the software in particular is almost painful to look at. OH - and it doesn't work!I returned the \"Ezcap3104B\" and ordered the VideoSecu DVU104 from the official VideoSecu website. But this too has problems. The hardware appears to be good (even on a Windows 7 computer), but the software does NOT work! Will not display the camera feed.I installed several different third-party trial versions of their software (namely Luxriot), and the VideoSecu DVU104 harware works. It displays the camera, but unfortunately these trail programs are limited to ONE camera - I need more than that for my system, and the full versions of the software are rather expensive!Good hardware, awful software. I am currently in the process of asking VideoSecu support if they have an updated version of their software that would perhaps fix this issue. I will update this review if they give me new information that fixes this problem.In the meantime, I suggest that you STAY AWAY from this item (especially the one sold here through WarehouseSeller).***UPDATE*** (and FIX)So, after contacting their support, they have notified me that several customers have had my issue and offered the following fix:In the settings, ALL of the camera inputs (even if you are using just one camera) must be set to NTSC, or else they will display a black screen.I have added one more star to my review, simply because now that I have it working (after much hassle), I am more or less satisfied.Adding additional cameras makes the frame rate drop sharply, but the system is now usable.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "very very poor and incomplete instrctions", "Author": "shaun", "ReviewID": "R3BPKNA7STZ7OF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Right now, this video capture card and associated camera and software setup gets a -5 for wasting a bunch of my time by having very very very poor and 1970 level instructions with 0 customer support on their site.

GREAT.After looking through the reviews of this product I noticed most of them gave this item 5 stars and this is the only product they have ever reviewed.  They all have names like \"Bob\" or \"Mary\", hail from nowhere, and write 20 word reviews. The useful honest reviews are entirely different. Go figure.  I feel ripped off.

I thought this was the way to go and save some money at the same time. I know a fair amount about computers and soforth so you know I am no idiot. I was going to use this for my business. I thought I would connect all the cameras and wires before running them to make sure everything is operational. Got everything set up and installed the CD for the software and it didnt work like all my other installs I have done in the past. Once it stoped I thought I would reboot to set everything but it wouldnt shut down windows as normal. At this point I just held in the power button to my computer that I had done before and that was all she wrote.I tried to turn my computer back on and there was no power to it. I freaked out. My business runs on this computer. I guess I should have not done something so risky. My priority was to get the computer back up. I had a computer tech come out ASAP that day. He said he hadent heard of such a thing happening. He said its either your power modual or mother board. If its your mother board, forget this computer. I was freaking out and praying it was just the power modul. After several hrs it turned out that the power mudule was gone. Replaced it and my computer was back.
