{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good, but.....", "Author": "Sick of being tricked", "ReviewID": "RWRW4Z3V7XASK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We now have five of these cameras. All are advertised as having a 9-22mm varifocal lens. All of our lenses are indeed variable, but two of the cameras are showing about a 22mm field at their widest setting. The other three show 9mm at the widest and 22mm at the narrowest, as is proper. We needed the wide angle 9mm, so two of the cameras are not as advertised. We did find a use for one of the faulty lenses, but the other is useless to us and we have contacted the seller for a resolution and are awaiting a reply. No doubt it will end up costing us somehow to make the switch. The camera cases are beefy and nice looking, but if you open them up you find a tiny little electronics card inside. The cases are just for show, to make you think you're getting something substantial. The cases could be 1/8th their size. The top plates (rain covers) fit badly (loose) on ALL of our cameras. The instructions are worthless and we can find no other online support. The LED lights are fairly bright, but also fairly tightly focused, so you don't get a broad beam. Colors are fine. Detail is fine also for a cheap 700 line camera. All worked out of the box and none have given any trouble except for the lens discrepancy. An example of the lens problem: We have two cameras in the backyard showing the back of the house. Each one is in an opposite corner of the house at exactly the same distance from the house. The properly functioning camera shows the entire house from side to side. The faulty camera, even at its widest setting, shows only one window. We're not sure if these are Chinese or Russian, but either way, we're really weary of overseas products that don't work properly. When a new camera arrives, we must now mount yet another expedition to the roof and remove the bad one and remount the good one.

All arrived with some sort of \"quality control\" issue.  Camera #1 had two screws missing from the case which allowed the case to separate.  There goes the water resist feature!  Fortunately I had the correct size screws (#2-56) to install and fix the issue.  Camera #1 is now installed and working fine.  Camera #2 had a loud rattle inside.  I disassembled the camera and a large screw fell out of the camera.  I couldn't find a place inside the camera that was missing a screw so I reassembled the camera without the screw and now Camera #2 is installed and working fine.  Camera #3 had a loose drip shield.  Upon inspection, I found the shield mounting plate to be loose.  I tightened the mounting plate, installed the drip shield and now Camera #3 is installed and working fine.  Bottom line?  Product is good overall but QC from VideoSecu is poor.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "QC Passed?", "Author": "S. Carr", "ReviewID": "R2EK0V05HN8UII", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This really looked like a good CCTV camera and probably is, but it arrived with two defects.  The first minor defect was the fact that the screw that holds the top cover on the camera is too short with the nylon washer installed.  The top cover was not secured when I received the camera.  The only way to secure the cover was to remove the nylon washer, since the screw is too short.  Not a big deal.But the camera also arrived with a loose part rattling around inside the camera.  I did not want to install the camera and have it short out due to the loose part inside.  I returned the defective camera to EDSI for repair or replacement.  EDSI requires the buyer to pay for returned products.  I find this a little hard to take, since they sent me a defective camera that had a \"QC Passed\" sticker on the bottom of the camera.  (Amazon stepped up to the plate and reimbursed me the return shipping charge).EDSI sent me the same camera back (same serial number).  They removed the nylon washer to make the top cover fit.  Hmm, I could have done that.  The camera still has the loose part rattling around inside of the unit.I plan to return the defective camera once again and seek a full refund of my purchase price.  And buy a camera from another company that knows what quality control means.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Arrived Broken, low quality.", "Author": "Mercy2915", "ReviewID": "R3JWDQYMB7ZMSI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera arrived with focus gears stripped out (bad assembly and QC). I was able to rig it so it sorta worked. Colors are very blue and washed out. Night video is actually pretty good. But lens gives a so-so quality \"fishbowl\" juttery picture. Kind of like looking thru a peep hole in a door. I serioulsy dobut this is 700 lines resolution. Its sure not \"high resolution\". The \"instruction manual\" is a one page double sided photocopy. Looks like somebody made it on a Ditto machine. This camera is NOT waterproof, just water resistant. There are gaps where water will obviously penetrate in a heavy storm. But for $120 I guess you sorta get what you pay for. It will be ok for my back yard. Since its not Amazon prime it would be a pain in the rear to return. So I just won't buy another one of these.

I messed around with the focus and it started working again.Day 3, cameara went blank but after about a day, it started working again.Day 5, the camera went blank and would not come up again.For the few moments it did work, the picture and night vision was great. However, I had to remove it and return it because it was defective.After many back and forth email to Warehouseseller, telling them of the intermittent problems, I returned the camera for a replacement. I had to pay for that shipping too.A few days later, I got an email back from Warehouseseller stating that they tested the camera and sent it back.Like others reported, if you return the product to EDSI for problems, they send you the same camera back without properly testing.Knowing it wasn't going to work, I plugged the camera into my system and sure enough, it was still broken.Now I have to get irate with them and send the camera back on my dime again.They kept telling me it was my connection but I used multiple wires with the power supply they provided to no avail. The wires worked just fine for other cameras.... I even went as far as to plug it into the wall directly. Still no pulse. One of the techs went as far as to tell me to use a shorter wire when they provide a 100ft wire.When I complained back to them that I don't know what you did to test this thing, they then told me how they tested it. They tested it in a non-use case scenario. They just plug it right into a tv in their shop and somehow this worked for them. I tried it but it didn't for me.EDSI/Warehouseseller could have saved everyone a lot of time and grief if they would have sent me an email with their findings (they think it works) before calling me a lier and just sending it back to me.If you have countless hours to spend installing, testing, removing, returning, re-installing, re-testing re-returning and a lot of extra shipping dollars, your in luck, this is the camera for you.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good not Great, expecially for the $$$'s", "Author": "Sejohnson", "ReviewID": "R3BWZ7JFV6PL3R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A good quality image, but, what is not very well explained in that this camera has a much more narrow field of vision that what I would say is normal.

I wanted one that would catch license plates of cars at night when they were coming at the camera with their head lights on at a slow rate of speed. It won't do that. But, what it will do is pick up cars on a road about 40 yards away 1 hour before sunrise. Its low light is very good even at long distances. I use it to record cars on my road that go buy every day, just in case there is a neighborhood burglary. It has a slight problem reading license plates in daylight too but that could be the recording software I use which is ClearVision Software INetAlertView. It is weather proof so I like that and works good in extreme cold.
