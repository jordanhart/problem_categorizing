{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Everyhting you wanted to know...", "Author": "\"rils\"", "ReviewID": "R27F1EPYIGQ3HM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello,Well, to cut short some of the remarks in those reviews, a few points:- The USB is not slow. Transferring a full 16Mo card to my computers (Windows XP/2000 or Mac OSX) takes less than 10 seconds. The slow USB problem is mostly due to computers running W98OSR2 (I don't have the exact reason, but the slow USB is not due to the camera).- Batteries: Olympus has the great idea to accept AA cells, adapted to rechargeable batteries (1.2V). You can buy two sets of nickel-metal batteries in any store for 20 bucks, with the charger. And even if you're in the middle of Continental India, you will find AA cells without problems, compared to lithium batteries. NiMh cells last longer than alkaline batteries, but make sure you always have a set of 4 batteries charged, especially if you use the LCD screen at all times. Now the good points of the camera:- a good optical system, with little deformation at wide angle, and a decent aperture. It can be used indoor without flash if the subject is static.- good flash exposure, and many capabilities (slow mode to keep the ambiance, red eyes reduction, flash off...).- Overall good light exposure. It is not op-perfect but the multi-zone measurement makes a good job in classic composition. For highly contrasted scenes, you can use the 'spot' measurement, which is maybe too wide to be really 'spot', but precise enough to expose one part of the picture perfectly.- Fast processing, probably due to a lot of RAM in the system. A full-size picture is processed in about a second.Bad points:- Noise of the zoom: it sounds awefull, but like most other digital cameras... The system that prevents the optical system to come out when the lens cap is on is a little weird, but proven efficient (I have that camera for more than 3 monts... Tested and approved)- Batteries run out quickly... BUY SOME RECHARGEABLE NI-MH. Those cameras are power hungry. The other solution is to wait 5 years, technology will be better and more power efficient!- Size? it's not a compact camera, and it won't fit in your shirt pocket. Price to pay for a decent lens, and a large LCD screen. In the other hand, it handles very well, and proves to be a very nice fit in your hand.- No sound in video mode: at that price point, I'm not really surprised. And to answer the question:\"How much would it cost to olympus to add a microphone\", I can answer: about 3 dollars (microphone+analog front end+D/A converter+processing power to encode sound!), and something more to add inside this already squeezed camera. If you want sound with the video, go to a better model - more expensive. The main purpose of a camera is... TO TAKE PICTURES!Overall rating: I like this camera, that provides good colors and very good exposure without hassle. A lot of manual features are available, very good for someone who knows how to use a regular film camera. At that price point...you will not get any better. The resolution is very good (3.3MPS) and detailled, indor photography is possible. If you need an even faster lens, check the C3030 (F1.8 constant), but you will pay a nice premium for the upgrade.

Patchen", "ReviewID": "R1R0M08NUZKW8E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my c-3020z for about three weeks now and really like it. As a beginning digitial photographer I was interested in a reasonably-priced 3.x MP camera that could take great point-and-shoot photos, but also offered enough manual control to take advantage of as my experience grows. I was also interested in a camera I could purchase a reasonably priced underwater housing for to take diving.  The 3020 delivered on all points.  I've found the image quality excellent, with sharp detail and accurate color. I take quite a bit of macro animal shots and I've found the detail it captures impressive, even if I blow it up on my PC. The menus are pretty intuitive as well once you learn what is where. I'm still learning when and how to use the manual modes; there are a few to choose from and I'm still figuring out how to take advantage of all this control. Having had a digital camera before, I didn't mess around with alkalines or memory and bought some rechargable NiMh batteries and a 128mb card.  I've been pleasantly surprised to find that this camera doesn't chew through batteries nearly as badly as my Kodak did, and a 128mb card is nicely capacious.  I can't wait to take it diving.  I've had no problems per se, but to be fair, here's what I don't appreciate about this camera:1. The manual that comes with it is pretty poor.  I'm going to get a photograpy book to help learn more about the manual capabilities and how/when to use them.2. Construction is ok, but the design, quality & feel pales compared to the nice metal Sonys.  Plastic back and buttons are not too sexy.3. Why can't Olympus get the [...] lens cap right!? Since the cap catches on the inside of the barrel, if you leave it on when you powerup, you will hear nasty gear sounds as the lens trys to push off the lens cap.  People have criticized this design for quite a while in other Oly c-class reviews.  Olympus--this is inexcusable.4. Macro capability is ok, but limited to about 8\".  For really close up work, I'm going to probably have to get a macro lens kit.Overall, this is a nice, powerful camera which takes fantastic pictures for a very reasonable price.", "Date": "November 28, 2001"}, {"Title": "Exceeds expectations", "Author": "Martin R.

I have had mine for only a few weeks and continue to discover new things, but in the meantime you can use it as a 'point and shoot' camera as you learn. I was looking for a camera built by a camera company with good optics and an understanding of the needs of the beginner as well as the serious amateur. They have done a good job.With 3.2 megapixels available, the quality of the finished photo can be excellent. I made a sharp 8 x 10 enlargement of our very hairy dog and every hair is sharply in focus and visible on the print.  The built-in flash is surprisingly good. Exposures with available light are more than adequate. The almost overwhelming variety of controls will take a while to learn and require referral to the manual, but many will not be used reqularly anyway. The printed manual is inadequate, but the manual on the CD included is excellent. The camera does not have 'video out' or sound, but if you don't feel you need those features, you can save $200 as compared to models which include them.  All in all, I could give this camera five stars, but nothing is perfect.  First accessory needed, a battery charger and rechargeable batteries.  Why doesn't the manufacturer include them?  Olympus does include Adobe Photoshop Elements which is an excellent program and will cost nearly $100 if bought separately.

Was a great learning camera, but photos could only be made up to 4 X 6.  This 3.3 megapixel camera will do a great job on enlargements up to 8 X 10.  Only complaint I have with it is that you must read the manual to know how to operate it--menu is not easy to understand on your own.  Also, no holder for lens cap--could easily be lost.  This is easily remidied, but a pain, nonetheless.  We have used the lithium batteries and use the camera very frequently and after seven months, batteries are still showing full charge--with older camera using 4-AA's, we were always changing batteries.  Have not even tried using the movie portion of the camera--have a digital camcorder for that purpose and understand that this camera will not take very long movies, but does an excellent job with still photographs.Lightweight, buttons are large enough that you do not need super nimble fingers to change settings on it.  Able to erase single pictures or all of card easily.  Uses smart card which we put right into the slot on our HP Photosmart printer, so no need to download onto computer if we do not wish to do so.  However, can download to computer via direct connection or with use of SanDisk adapter--both are quite easy to learn to use.  Must have smart disk to take photos, whereas with our older model, there was possibility to take up to 10 photos on internal memory of camera.  Smart cards are easy to insert and change, tho, so no problem.If you have the money, this would be an excellent camera to learn to do digital on, and is an excellent camera to continue using throughout.", "Date": "December 14, 2001"}, {"Title": "Olympus has a winner!", "Author": "Bob Sacamano \"Kavorka\"", "ReviewID": "R3W2GULSP70PRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our first digital camera and I must say that we love this thing!  I read all the reviews of all comparable cameras and decided on this baby.  I'm well aware of the TV Out and sound functions being removed since the C-3000 Zoom. These are not important to most people and will not be missed. If you want to watch tv and have little movies with sound, get a camcorder. The optics are great and the lcd has great resolution as well. Now onto the picture quality. The photos at high resolution are absolutely stunning. Make sure to take the lens cap off before turning on or it will cause the lens motor to grind. This is the only mechanical fault of this camera. Need to get NiMH rechargeable batteries and a charger. You'll also need to upgrade the Smartmedia card for big photo shoots. You can get about 24 pics at high res on the included 16 MB card. USB connectivity is plug and play. Your camera shows as a hard drive in Explorer and file transfer is blazing!The included Adobe Photoshop Elements is $99 value, great program for picture editing. Included paper manual is lame, but the manual on the CD-ROM is great.A great camera at a great price. Everything works great out of the box with no immediate need for additional accessories.

I wanted the 3 megapixels to print up to 8x10 if I choose to. Fairly easy to use out of the box and takes great pictures with little effort. I am sure I will be able to customize for some great pics. Here are the highlights/lowlights of the camera.- The lens cap situation is horrible. If you leave the cap on and turn the camera on, the motor churns to expand the lens tube. I think the motor times out before any damage happens, but bad nonetheless. The camera should have an automatic lens cover, like some of olympus clamshell cameras. I've decided I can live with the lens cap issue.- You can preview the picture after you take it without changing modes. VERY NICE feature.- Olympus has a very effective red-eye reduction flicker flash.- The optical 3xzoom is adequate for most shots. The digital zoom appears bogus. Haven't used it yet, manual says it could be grainy.- Try on-line printing of your digital pics... Otofo is much higher priced. I tried it and the pics came out GREAT.- The camera has different pre-set shooting modes for portraits, action, night scenes, and landscapes.- The...price seems very fair for the optical zoom @3.2 megapixel.

At this price point however, I might be more tempted to get the Minolta S304 and pick up a better zoom lens.", "Date": "December 7, 2001"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera - minor design problems", "Author": "Simon P Oliver", "ReviewID": "R1UQ3FCGC8IPDA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in August 2002 as my first foray into the world of digital photography and have used it a lot since. Overall I have been very pleased. It feels comfortable in the hand and takes extremely clear pictures with good color balance. I have taken pictures in environments ranging from the beach at mid-day to the top of the Empire State building at night and the camera managed well in all cases, though as with any camera, camera-shake at night is a problem and you might want to consider using a tripod. The only time I have had any problem with quality is when taking pictures in low light in a restaurant when speckling noise became an issue. Overall this is a very good and functional little camera which takes excellent pictures, gives you quite a bit of manual control if you want it, but takes very good \"snaps\" automatically if you don't. I take it everywhere and since each shot is essentially free, take far more photos than I would have done with a conventional camera. I would now not be parted with it.However, while generally very satisfied, I do have some complaints as follows: 1) The lens cap falls off FAR too easily. You have to be really careful when putting the camera into a bag or the lens cap will definitely be dangling on its string. 2) The on-off / mode-selector dial can very easily be knocked from the Off position when handling / storing the camera. This turns the camera on in one mode or another, which is annoying. If you don't notice this has happened, the convenient auto timeout will save your batteries but it would be better if the dial offered more resistance when in the Off position. 3) The zoom control is somewhat unresponsive making it very difficult or even impossible to accurately zoom by a small amount. You have to nudge the control very briefly and then wait for the lens to catch up with the requested tiny adjustment. It's very counter intuitive. Zooming from one extreme to another is easy but minor adjustments are something of a practiced art. So for occasions that need rapid shooting, you may find this frustrating.I have found that a 3x zoom is somewhat inadequate for anything other than generally modifying the framing and composition of the picture. Forget any hopes of sneaking up on wildlife or people, since for that you will need 7x or more and this camera is just not going to deliver. Frustrating but not a fault. You can see upfront what you are buying and if 3x is OK for you, then go ahead, if not, spend more money and get a more powerful zoom on a different camera. This is the issue more than any other that is making me think of trading up for a different camera. Too often, I just cannot get the telephoto shots I can see presented in front of me.The Camedia software shipped with the camera is very good and I use it a lot in \"slideshow\" mode to view all my pictures. However, now that I have about 1000 pictures in one directory, it is apt to crash at startup if I do not allow it sufficient time to scan all the images before scrolling through the list of thumbnails. Irritating but not a major problem. The USB interface works like it is supposed to with Win2000. No problem, it does what it says on the box. Fast and error free.All in all, a very nice little camera at a reasonable price. The bottom line has to be good pictures and this camera definitely delivers. If it had a longer lens and got the few niggles ironed out, this could be close to being my ideal camera.", "Date": "October 24, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great digital camera", "Author": "Photo nut \"cyber_surfer\"", "ReviewID": "R1MNVY4MK1GDQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks to all earlier reviewers. Your comments were very helpful and I'm very pleased with the camera.  I don't want to repeat much of what others have covered very well already. My lens cap has not been a problem. It stays in place after I click it onto the lens. Maybe they have responded to peoples concerns, lets hope that's the case. Once or twice I have forgotten to remove the lens cover and got a beeping noise to remind me (no apparent harm done). The provided lanyard keeps the lens cap from getting lost.  My camera makes no unusal noise when the lens moves in or out. I can only compare it to another digital camera I have and a 3x lens on a film camera I have. The noise generated is very similiar in all three cameras.  No Photo Elements software provided.  The provided image editor was weak in capability and I am not using it. You can download pictures by bringing up \"My Computer\" (in XP) and when you turn on the camera a removable drive appears. You click on it and on a folder thats follows it and your pictures are available to drag and drop to a folder of your choice.  The printed documentation was not very helpful.

It was purchased to replace a middle grade 35mm point and shoot, but it appears that it will be able to do far more than that.  Everyone comments on the battery usage, and the advice to buy two sets of rechargables is good.  One must learn to remove the lens cap or suffer the noise, although so far no apparent damage.  I do miss having a UV filter and am waiting for Olympus to offer one so I can dispense with the lens cap.  Some of the bells and whistles like panorama, macro,  and bracket shooting are in reality quite valuable. Red eye prevention is good, but the delay is more than I would like.

In the interest of full disclosure, I do have to admit that I am not a camera expert. I do, however, have a friend who is a professional photographer and took me out for the day when I bought this to help me learn the ins-and-outs of the features. What I found is that this camera offers a good selection of features for folks that do not aspire to being anything more than amateur photographers. For true hobbyists and professionals, you may want to pay more for a full-featured digital. This camera has some custom settings available, but not to the degree that most enthusiasts are really going to desire. When people complain about these being power-hungry little monsters, they're absolutely correct. My first set of batteries made it through about half of my first day. I thought I was being battery conscience at the time. Now that I've gotten the hang of the camera a bit more though, I found that taking pictures without using the lcd screen makes the batteries last \"a lot\" longer. So far, I've found that buying the lithium photography batteries are a great investment. As a climber, the batteries are lighter and don't freeze at low temperature.I'm generally happy with the picture quality. Using the highest resolution TIFF setting and printing out to 8X10, you see only very slight pixellation when you hold the photo up at reading distance. I've certainly found them good enough to frame at my house. I cannot begin to tell you how great it is to not have to worry about using film and paying to print all of your photos. Using the USB connection, the picture transfers from my camera are pretty fast. You can pinpoint the ones you want in a matter of moments and pick the best ones to send off for processing, right over the internet. I strongly suggest that you upgrade your SmartMedia card right out of the gate. The 16MB card is not enough to really take many non-compressed images. I bought the 128MB card and that seems to be as good as it gets. I may even buy another card so that I have plenty of room for taking as many photos as I can on a climbing or hiking trip. I also recommend that you purchase some sort of protective case for the camera if you're going to use it much outdoors. As other reviewers have mentioned, due to the quality lens on the camera, the camera body is pretty large, and in need of a bit of protection when packing it.", "Date": "June 27, 2002"}, {"Title": "Lens cap notwithstanding...", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R16X7XOE7NM97M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd digital camera after doing 35mm (Olympus OM-10) for about 20 years.

The C-3020 was just what I needed, and my 35mm is now for sale. I love the special effects (try a few shots using \"white board\" and see what people think.)I think the biggest factor for me in choosing digital, besides the much lighter weight, is the ability to edit and alter my own pictures without being at the mercy of photo services.About the lens cap. I may be able to offer a tip to make it stay on a little better. When you put the cap on, start with the \"Olympus\" logo upside down as you face the lens. Put the cap on. Then, while applying light pressure to the cap, turn it clockwise until it is snug and the logo is upright. The pressure will allow one side of the cap to seat itself one groove farther in, making for a tighter fit.", "Date": "May 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Little gem of a digicam", "Author": "ellafan", "ReviewID": "R2RSLVS3YA5JNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second digicam..the first was an excellent 1.3 megapixel.However, I wanted to be able to do more \"stuff\" and enlarge pics up to at least 8x10..so I read a lot of reviews and input from the consumers here, and gave it a shot.

Very compact, fairly nice, but I wanted the resolution that a 3 megapixel would give me.  So I returned the Fuji.I did a LOT of research - but a friend who owns the place I bought the camera at suggested that I not bother going to the C4040 because there wasn't enough gain in the extra megapixel to justify the price and extra storage;  That unless I was printing much larger than 8x10, it was going to be a waste of resolution.  I wanted the C3040, but he had no inventory and he talked me into the C3020.On the issue of resolution he was right.  However there are some nits:1. There is some minor edge convergence artifacting on high resolution shots.  Normal people might not notice.2. Unlighted and dark shots must be manually focussed.3. Movie mode without sound?

A 32mm to 96mm range gives you EXCELLENT wide angle unavailable in similar cameras, and still a good zoom for practical photography.If you are taking pictures of the kids just about any digital will do, but if you like scenic and landscape shots, the wide angle capabilities and 3.2 REAL mPix will give you excellent 8x10s and beautiful sunsets etc. with the noise reduction. Remember to buy a nice table tripod for those low light situations and you won't need a more sensitive lense.I also own an Olympus 2040Z, and I have never been able to take a bad shot no matter how bad I mess up. Keep it on auto and it will probably do better than you can with manual unless you want special effects.The battery advantage has been discussed elsewhere but I thought of getting the Cannon S40.

NiMh AAs are available with near the capacity of Lith ion these days and keep getting better.

Well if you buy a scanner, printer, or new computer you get that anyway so why pay for more. I'm glad they kept the price down and left the software out. I have Photoshop Elements and 5 others anyway so certainly didn't want to pay for another copy.Resolution is not what's cranked up to be. Cannon's S40 is actually 3.9 real pixels.

I love that it can be used totally automatic and get great shots AND that you can choose to set things  manually for special shots.  The resolution is great!  When shooting at the High Quality setting you can choose to crop just a small portion of the image to print...and it comes out so crisp and rich.And downloading to your computer is just too easy!  I do recommend purchasing a 64 meg flash card though...because the 8meg that comes with the camera really does fill up fast. With the 64 it is like traveling with 2 to 3 rolls of film plus you have the 8 meg back up.  Also be sure and purchase a set of rechargable batteries...they last so much longer than standard AA batteries.This camera is a great value for the money.

How much would a microphone have cost Olympus to put in??  Seems sort of a waste to even have the movie feature at all without sound.- The motor, I've read it before, and must agree, it sounds like each time the lens comes whirring out of it's shell, it will be the last time.  God awful sound.  Cannot get away from the feeling that they REALLY cut some corners making this camera- ....- Shape and size.  This camera is too large in odd ways.  It is small and large all at once.  Hard to explain, but that is how it felt.  It will not fit in a jacket pocket, forget about a shirt pocket or pants pocket.  The shape is awkward.  While I was holding it, I kept having the feeling like I would drop it if I did not pay attention to the fact that I was holding it.- Last but not least.  The batteries!  I initially thought, well with AA support, I'll never be without batteries as long as I can find a corner store in my hour of need.  What a mistake.  Within the first 2 days I went through 3 sets of 4 batteries.  I really did not think this through.  In retrospect, to me given the availability of lithium battery technology, it would be like buying a laptop computer that used D alkalin batteries for power.  People would laugh at the idea.  They should too when it comes to alkalin and Digital CamerasI ended up returning this camera and moving up a bit to a better camera and am SO much happier.  I bought a Canon S30 and it fulfilled ALL the things I found lacking in the Olympus 3020.  Given that it came with a rechargable lithium battery and charger, if I had kept the Olympus and bought rechargable AA batteries and charger, I would have only spent around 50 more dollars.My last comment in the hopes that some Olympus employee will actually read this and take some action is this.  I mainly bought this camera because I had an Olympus 35MM film camera and loved it (still do!).  It lacked all the things that I had come to expect with my film camera.  Why they could not have used the same camera shell is beyond me.  They do on their lower end models.

I have been using it several times.  I also bought rechargable battery and 128M smart media card.  Personally, I did not find it difficult to learn.  I am doing scientific work, use different scientic digital cameras that hook to the microscopes.  That could be the reason.  The pictures look very good.  The manual is not difficult to understand, although it is brief if you don't have good knowledge about  photography.  There is a more detailed manual (pdf file) on the software CD .  The camedia software  included is only useful to recognise camera as a hard drive when connected to a computer with USB cable.  I use Mac.  When I tred to open flies it crushed the computer.  However, Adobe photoshop element  is also included that should solved the problem.  Since I have adobe photoshop on the computer, so I did not load photoshop element.  I have used the camera almost exclusively in Manual mode.  The reason I like to use manual mode is that  at least  30% of chance the picture  exposure is  kind of off  if not way off when using the automatic mode (This applies to all point shoot  cameras).  The situation gets worse when light condition is complicated.  When use manual mode, If the the exposure is off, just adjust the shutter speed or aperture to get correct exposure.  The good thing about digital camera is you can take several shots with different exposure and pick the one you like and delete others.  You can see the picture right after you taken it.  You can adjust exposure if the picture is not good.  After several shots to get used to the camera,  I find it is not difficult to operate within manual mode.  It is quite fast.  I would recommed people to learn to use the manual mode.  It give you the chance to optimize your photos and you pay for this feature.  The camera without manual mode are cheaper.  I also find there is another way to deal with incorrect exposure with automatic mode.  If go through manual, you can select a setting, allows you to take 3 picture if you hold the button down for a while.  One is the exposure you normally get from automatic  mode.  The other two are one under-exposure and one over-exposure of automatic exposure.  The level of under and over-exposure can also be set.  It is a nice feature for people do not want to go through manual mode.  However, changing under or over-exposure levels involves too many steps.  To me, it is faster to change exposure condition within manual mode.  The pictures I have taken are generally very nice, sharp with good color balance.  The only reason I give it  4 star is that  this is my first personal digital camera and I don't know other cameras at simailar price range work  compare to this one.

Even indoor shots came out crystal clear with no red-eye; colors are crisp and beautiful, and the detail is stunning. I'll take this camera over any other one at the ...price point. I just printed a couple 8 x 10-sized shots on my cheap HP-845C inkjet using Kodak premium photo paper, and wow!!! The prints are indistinguishable from 35mm photos. A couple of other positives about the C-3020 that other reviews may not have mentioned: (1) Olympus backs the camera with a full one-year parts AND labor warranty (Sony only does 90 days for labor, and trust me, their labor charge is ridiculously high); and (2) there is a very good camera manual contained on the CD ROM, in addition to the shorter printed manual. Incidently, my package did not have Adobe software but Olympus' own program called Camedia 2.5, which is a rather basic photo program. No big deal, though; the camera is well worth the price. Also, I think the C-3020 has just the right size, look and feel: it looks and feels almost like a professional SLR camera, yet is not bulky or heavy. Granted, it won't fit in your shirt pocket, but it's fairly light and thus no hassle to carry about. Concerning the batteries, you can buy rechargeable NIMH AAs fairly cheaply these days, and they last a LONG time in this camera. Bottom line: if you want a quality, mid-priced 3-plus megapixel digicam that takes beautiful 8 x 10s (indoors or out) and is easy to use yet has enough manual adjustment options for creative photography, then you can't go wrong with the C-3020.", "Date": "April 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "After !!MUCH!! research, very happy with this camera", "Author": "DVM XU GBP \"dvm555\"", "ReviewID": "R3VBH73GG841B4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As far as the camera, we are very happy with ours.  It does everything we wanted and my wife knows how to use it.  It has plenty of mega pixels.  That was one of my first criterion.  The second, and this came from a guy I work with that is a camera NUT, was aperture.  This is the camera specification they give with an \"f\" and a number and tells you how much light is allowed in the lens when a picture is taken, especially important at night.  This camera has an \"f\" of like 2.7.  The TOP OF THE LINE Olympus had one of 1.7 (the lower the better) and some cheaper Olympus models and others had \"f's\" of 4.something.  This guy from work convinced me that aperture was important enough to go down to 2.7 from the high 4's but not important enough to go all the way down to 1.7, certainly not at the additional cost of $[money] that the top of the line Olympus commanded.  This also does little things that I like: black and white picture option, exact time and date stamp attached to the picture file but not on the picture itself, red eye reduction, timer and a decent size LCD screen that I can zoom in and out on.  And downloading pictures to pc is easy.Additionally, even though this camera includes a 24MB SmartMedia card, I would buy an additional 128MB SmartMedia card (the 24 only holds about 24 \"normal\" pictures).  2 cards are nice (especially if 1 is plenty big) so you don't have to bring many cards on say vacations and such.

I have use this camera to take close ups of small objects and sunsets.  Takes excellent pictures in any kind of light.", "Date": "September 18, 2003"}, {"Title": "Pretty good value", "Author": "J. Northrup \"TrueJim\"", "ReviewID": "R27UMUF8M2ZFYM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for almost a year now, with no problems. Some of the quasi-negative reviews I've seen here have some merit: the zoom control is a little too \"coarse\" in its responsiveness, and the camera isn't great in extremely-low-light situations. That having been said, how many photos do you try to take in extremely-low-light situations? In normal low-light situations (e.g., a typical restaurant), I think it works just fine. The camera is a little slow to take photos, and the lens cap can be knocked off if you shove the camera into a bag...but again, I wouldn't consider these things to be the \"major\" flaws that other reviewers seem to feel they are. I've also read some criticism of the camera's physical structure -- but mine feels pretty darn solid! I take mine on hikes with my dogs, and I let the neighborhood kids run around taking photos with it -- it's held up well.  When I bought it a year ago, I think it was a good value for the dollar -- newer cameras may be a better deal now, but I'm very surprised by the negative reviews I've read here.

The picture quality is excellent, and to be honest is usually a lot better than I need.  I generally end up saving the files at much lower resolution than possible, and still get clear quality images.  Also an extremely durable camera in my experience...I have gone through many, but have been using this one for several years now, with no troubles beyond having to change the batteries once in a while.

Outdoors and in bright situations the 3020 performs very well. Indoors I find it difficult to take good shots consistently. When I use the flash I get flat boring pictures, without a flash there is often not enough light.  One solution is to use the  black and white or Sepia function for indoor shots. Asking people to stand still also works nicely.  If you can afford it, the best solution is to step up to the Olympus 3040 which has a faster brighter lens (1.8 vs 2.8)  I read several postings about the batteries burning out quickly.  Please note: ALL DIGITAL CAMERAS EAT REGULAR ALKALINE BATTERIES FOR LUNCH. Rechargeable NiMH batteries will last much much longer and will save you a ton of money. It's also a good idea to keep a set of non-rechargeable Lithium batteries around, but bag the idea of using regular alkaline except in emergencies.

It is full-featured, compact, light, cute-looking, and well-constructed.  The zoom works great, the LCD screen is bright and colorful, and the indicator displays are very helpful once you decode the cryptic language in which they speak.I am particularly pleased about the camera taking AA-size batteries.  I use rechargeable batteries in the camera, but I know that I can just pop into any store and get regular AA batteries to run the camera in case my rechargeables unexpectedly run out of juice.This camera works great with Apple's iPhoto software.  I plugged in the (included) USB cable to my iBook, and iPhoto recognized the camera.  It imported the pictures from my camera, and deleted the originals from the camera (per my request) without a problem.Here are a few complaints I have about this camera, though:The lens cap is poorly constructed and easily pops off when slipping the camera into a camera bag.The panoramic photo mode is difficult to use.  When enabling panoramic mode, a bunch of blue lines appear on the LCD screen, with arrows.  Pushing any of the directional buttons changes the positioning of the arrows and the lines, but it really doesn't help with composing the photo at all.  You have to play with the panoramic mode and take a bunch of shots to figure out how it works.

Most serious: In one year since I owned the camera, theimage already shows two \"Bright Spots\" like the cell that felloff your retina of your eyeball, and every picture has thesespots in bright red color. I wonder if they are result of\"PIXEL\" that fell due to normal \"were and tear\"?Anyway, now I have to doctor every single picture I take bythis camera.(2). Second: the camera body feels delicate, almost ready tofall apart, maybe due to poor craftsmanship, maybe justplanned obsolescence!! (3). The setting up routing is too complicated, for collegemechanic department graduates only, definitely not forartistic type of person. (4). Poor manual, almost totally unintelligible! (5). I think this camera has serious flaws, both indesign and in craftsmanship. Olympus is too big a companyto suffer from bad reputation brought by this camera.But maybe it really doesn't care, thinking people willjust continue to buy their camera when one is out ofcommission within 1 year!!
