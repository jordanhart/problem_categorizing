I did, however, look at a lot of (>100) cameras; my criteria were:  (1) < $100 and lower is better, (2) image stabilization, (3) minimum 5x optical zoom, (4) Well rated both by consumers and professional reviewers, (5) Low (and explainable) number of poor reviews.The only camera that made the final cut was the Olympus FE-46.My girlfriend has had the camera just less than a week, but she was and is thrilled with it. She is still learning the many options she has, and is slowly mastering them, but has had absolutely no complaints.Ironically, buying the camera in the \"Crayola\" package, which included a decent case, was substantially less expensive than simply buying the camera.  BTW, for those who may be concerned about buying the \"child's package\", the camera is packaged in a retail box in the larger box.The camera also has a tripod mount (although we've not used it), which increases its utility.  It also seems to be solidly made, and has an automatic lens cover when powered down reducing the chances of significant damage.There are only two potential downsides I see so far; first, it uses disposable AA batteries (NiMH rechargeable batteries may be an option), and the proprietary xD media cards is being phased out (the MASD-1 adapter can be used, but may be difficult to replace if lost).", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great price for a great camera.", "Author": "Tabitha D.

This is a terrific point-and-shoot camera that takes very good video. The extra features are a lot of fun to play with.

Griffin", "ReviewID": "R2V114A67NHMHR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this for my 3 y/o because the other kids cameras seem terrible. This is an ok camera, but in the end it is just to slow to compose a picture for a fast moving child even in the daylight.  You need a tripod to take clear pictures with this thing.  I don't recommend it. I'll just let her inherit my old cameras.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review - Check back for Updates", "Author": "HWWoman \"HWWoman\"", "ReviewID": "R3RZ9SJ94LVXUH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this very cute pink Olympus FE-46 today with the Crayola package for less than $60 as an open box item from a local retail store. I am going to update this when I have a better working knowledge of all the camera features.  There are a good amount of features.  I like the Magic Filter features - particularly the Wedding and PopArt.  You can create a studio look without having to go in and use editing software.  The camera has a reputation of being slow at capturing images.  Hopefully there is a way to work around this.The specs are all available for you to view.  Just be aware that the camera uses AA batteries, so rechargeables would be a good idea. Also it uses the XD card, but comes with an adapter for micro SD (yay!), so it will be easy to find memory cards even if the XD card becomes obsolete.  With the microSD card set at the 5MP setting, I will be able to take around 5900 photos on the 4GB card.Okay the good and bad so far:1) Magic Filters - I haven't tried all 3, but the \"dreamy\" filter - which which is great for portraits and weddings and Facebook - adds a new dimension to your photos.  It's like having your own personal photographer.  I took some stunning photos of my daughter and my husband took a few good ones of me (yay! some new photos for Facebook!)  Good :)2) Description of Features right on camera - you push display and you can see an explanation of what feature you are trying to use; Good :)3) Burns through batteries - my other cameras are all Sonys, so battery life is shockingly short as compared with Sony batteries - you will need rechargeables plus a 15-minute high speed charger; Bad :(4)Shutter Speed - very slow as far as I can see again as compared with my Sony cameras.Hopefully some of the setting options will compensate for this.  Bad :(In summary so far, a good second camera for projects with some excellent and fun features - not recommended as a primary, single camera.More to follow....", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "D \"D\"", "ReviewID": "R17VP9HADF6SKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased for my son mother as her mother day gift.

The only problem I have is that the picture can sometimes come out blurry, depending on the setting chosen.  The default setting works fine.  Also, for some reason, the camera takes an eternity to take the first picture after you have turned it on, but after that, the camera is fast.  I got the camera for only $60.  For the price tag, the quality was great.  If you really want high quality pictures, then don't get this camera.
