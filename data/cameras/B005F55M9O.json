Not great pictures but then what you pay is what you get. Nice color here my wife loved it its just a shame these cameras dont come with built in memory and the Sd cards must be bought seperate. Id think in this day and age with memory being so cheap it wouldnt be such an issue. Worth buying just to have a backup in your auto for accidents or to catch the odd UFO that flies over.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a happy camper.", "Author": "Jeff Blessing", "ReviewID": "RV9MAYNKJ2YXL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My wife and I bought one of these cameras.  When taking pictures outdoors, ALL photos come out white-washed.  They look fine in the view finder until you press the button, and then WHITE.  The video feature works okay outside, but the still photo function sucks with a capital \"SUCKS\".  I tried contacting Vivitar's support and listed all the settings of the camera in hopes it would help.  Their response was \"don't take pictures in bright lighting.\"  So if you plan on taking pictures outside while it's rather sunny or lightly overcast, do NOT purchase this camera.  I know WE never will ever again.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "jtjam", "ReviewID": "R33EZAHFUHPNU7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this for my 5 year old and had to send it back because it really felt like a cheap cheap camera.

I have a windows 8 computer and was unable to load their software - which was meant for operating systems through windows 7.  However, my computer has a slot to directly read the SD card so I should be OK.  The unit uses 3 AA batteries.  It is a little tricky getting the cover for the SD card slot off the camera.  They have a good user manual for this unit at the  Vivitar website.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than what I saw reveiwed.", "Author": "Roy Buntyn", "ReviewID": "R1Q45HGYDEL21W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been a great deal both in price and what you get. I wanted a digital camera to be a camera not a phone or video recorder. This Vivtar camera fillled the bill, and for a great price. 14.1 megapixels are more then enough to work with. No problems in shooting pictures inside or outside, and yes, you need to hold it still like a regular camera. The moral of the story is don't allows believe what you read about the product, it could just be fine. The true beauty is in the hands of a good or great photographer. Great camera and would buy another one again when I need one.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$49.99", "Features": "14.1 Megapixels, 2.7-inch TFT LCD Screen\n4x Digital Zoom, Optical 3x Zoom, Anti-Shake\nLens Features: Face Detection, Auto Focus, Image Stabilization\nCamera Features: Digital Image Stabilization, Auto Focus, Face Detection Technology, Self Timer\nBuilt-in ViviLink; Directly Choose Your Social Network with the Press of a Button", "Name": "Vivitar VF332-GRP-TA 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 1.7-Inch LCD (Purple)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31X3HOkYk9L.jpg", "ProductID": "B005F55M9O"}}
