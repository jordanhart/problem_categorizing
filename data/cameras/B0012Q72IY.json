{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great camera for both new and seasoned photographers", "Author": "J. Smith", "ReviewID": "R1FP0HIHM6N3P7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an amateur photographer who's always used point-and-shoot cameras.  Finally, I got up the nerve (and cash) to get myself a DSLR.I started doing lots of reading and reviewing the various reviews/features of different cameras, eventually settling on the Pentax K200D.I have never owned anything made by Pentax/Canon/Nikon/Olympus/Sony before, so I didn't have any sort of brand loyalty ties.  I took long, hard looks at the features and performance and went from there.There are several reasons why I chose the Pentax K200D over similar models from other manufacturers:1) Weather sealing -- Pentax claims their camera is the only environmentally sealed camera in its class (\"starting DSLR\").  Nice to know it's there, even if I don't plan on intentionally testing it out!2) Saving High quality JPEG and RAW at the same time (RAW+).  Some of the other models I was considering didn't allow RAW + High JPEG, only medium JPEG.3) Very high build quality.  This thing feels like it's built like a tank.  After reading literally hundreds of user reviews from Canon owners, Nikon, etc. the general consensus was their bodies (and cheap lenses) felt a little flimsy.  I must admit, I went to the stores and tried out their cameras (the entry DSLR) and I felt the same way.Popular Photography's preview of the K200D said it best: \"Mate a tank with a SLR body...\" or something to that effect.4) AA batteries.  I know some people consider this a downside, but decent 2500mha AAs are extremely cheap and work great.  If I ever run out of juice, I know I can hit up practically any store for a recharge.5) You can mount any lens Pentax has ever made on this camera.  Of course, you may not get all the features, but the consistency of the lens mounting was a plus for me.6) In-body stabilization - A real biggy for me, as this translates to any lens you buy for the system!  It has already saved several of my shots.7) It's an APS-C sensor -- this discounted the Olympus line immediately.----------------------------------So how do I like the camera?  So far it's great!I've only owned it a few days, but I've been doing lots of testing with the kit lens (which, according to \"the net\", isn't as horrible in quality as some other kit lenses).Autofocus is fairly quick, though low light seems to be throwing it off sometimes (duh!)Light metering seems to be very consistent -- I'm not getting surprise too dark or too light shots unless I intentionally screw the shot up (like forgetting to reset EV , doh).Burst rate is a bit low at 4 JPEG or RAWs - but I don't plan on doing too many sports shots so hopefully this won't be a limiting factor.  I'm awaiting some Sandisk Ultra II SD cards to come in before I see how much this low rate limits me -- hopefully the fast card will allow a quick buffer flush.The grip is confortable for me, a 6-foot tall male with large/medium hands.  So far I haven't accidentally hit a button while operating the camera, etc.  I haven't done prolonged shooting yet.The menu options are pretty self-explanatory, and I like the manual they give you (though it's huge) -- They do a pretty good job explaining what various functions do, etc.-------------------------------------------So, the verdict?  If you're moving from a point and shoot digital camera (I had a Kodak Easyshare Z612 6MP), this thing is going to blow it away!Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.  The kit lens isn't total garbage, the menu functions are easy to access and the camera performs admirably.The only thing I miss moving from my PNS camera is the zoom.My next purchase will probably be the fast 50mm prime lens for portraits.I've been shooting in low-light situations (my house tonight) and so far it's doing great.I've also taken it outdoors on a sunny day for some pretty good looking shots.  I can't wait to upgrade to a good zoom to catch more wildlife.[...]", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent DSLR at a bargain price", "Author": "David Michael Bryson", "ReviewID": "R12I7ASKYFTR35", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously owned a Pentax K100D.  I decided to step up to a DA* lens and wanted a body to match its weather sealing and SDM motor.  The K200D is the perfect prosumer DSLR.  It has all of the great features of the K100D Super (the K100D with dust removal), plus many more.  The 10.2MP sensor takes great photos.  The construction is solid and the dust/water sealing clearly visible on all doors.  As with the K100D, this model uses AA batteries, a feature I love.  Paired with a couple of sets of NiMH rechargeable batteries (I have 2500 ma Sonys), you are set for over 1500 photos.  Also included, built in support for wireless flash operation with the internal flash as master (the K100D required an external flash as the master).Overall an excellent upgrade from the K100D, and a bargain compared to the K10D from which it gets its CCD.  I highly recommend it for prosumers and entry-level professional photographers.", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Just what it says...", "Author": "SCOTT", "ReviewID": "RJ3W40JR3DOTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the K200 for 2 days now...I got the K200 instead of the K10 for several reasons. (1) I wanted a DSLR(tired of my \"point-n-shoot\" and out grew it), (2) My wife needed to be able to use it for her business. Probably more me than her. I had been admiring the K10 for a while and played with it at the store, really wanting it. When the K200 and K20 came out the K10 only remained for sale on line, at least in my area. I drove my wife crazy for weeks reading reviews and even downloading the manuals from the Pentax website as well as other brands. I didn't want to spend this kind of money without actually holding the camera(it's not in the stores yet). Almost all the stores never even heard of the K2oo because the K20 takes top billing..14 mega pixels. Long story short...the advertisement on the K200 is as far as I can see very accurate. Its for those graduating to DSLR and still need some AUTO features. I am not going to try to fool you with a lot of professional sounding lingo. Lets just say I would have preferred the K10 but love this camera. You cannot shoot a bad picture...REALLY! If you can skip through the technical talk in the manual, it tells you everything you need to know. The camera still has plenty of room to play for those of us learning more about how to manipulate shots how we want them plus the auto features for those who aren't. I really like the way Pentax feels like a REAL camera, not cheap plastic like others. My brother owns a popular Cannon. See for yourself, go to a store and hold any of the Pentax late models(K10,K200,K20). I am still fixated on the more advanced K20 but that's for the near future. Then my wife can have this one back.By the way, Thanks Amazon!!! You sent me a message saying my shipment might be delayed but you upgraded the shipping so I still received it on time...You ROCK. I will continue to use you.", "Date": "March 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very pleased", "Author": "Mikhail Stoma \"3dMike\"", "ReviewID": "R3VK0VNJLRKEEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For over five years I used 3.2MP Olympus D-540 camera.It still works fine. But I decided to step up for some more megapixels.I purchased Panasonic Lumix LZ7... It was ok, but I didn't get \"wow effect\" as I expected...Then I purchased Olympus FE-340, same absence of \"wow\".Then I got Fujifilm Finepix S700... I still felt that my old Olympus was getting better shots.Then I decided to get a real camera... After a lot of research I decided to go with Pentax K200D. After I saw the first shot with it, I got that \"wow effect\" I expected. Really sharp photo and real colors.And this camera still makes me wow each time I make a shot. Like another reviewer said: \"you really can not make a bad shot\".It's my first DSRL camera, so I can not compare it to any else. But some things that convinced me to get it were: -Weather resistant build. It even has seals in memory slot, USB port and battery port.-Hardware shake reduction function. Still didn't get any blurred image, and I believe my hands are not \"shake-free\".-Accessible AA batteries (you can get it in every shop)-Really fast Autofocus (according to one review 1.2 seconds compared to Rebels 3 seconds)The only bad thing I found (or may better to say: I didn't expect) is that you are obliged to see thru viewfinder to make a shot... Something I didn't expect from a digital camera. But I'm used to it, because I still remember how to use my father's old Zenith 35mm camera.Other than that it's a great camera that takes sharp photos with life-bright colors.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great DSLR value, AA battery support, picture quality, lens compatibility", "Author": "Julien Pierre \"Software engineer and amateur ...", "ReviewID": "R20UA2JZMDAJG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not sure why my first review didn't end up getting posted . So I am writing it again.I have had this camera for about a month, purchased from Amazon, which got it to me less than 48 hours after I clicked \"order\" with the free shipping - amazing.This is my first DSLR. I owned two digicams before, a 2000 Olympus C3030Z 3 MP, and a 2006 Nikon Coolpix L1 6 MP.Price wise, the K200D is a steal, especially with the rebate deals going on this summer - about $550 after rebate with the DA 18-55 AL II kit lens. Compared to other DSLRs, the only other comparable model feature-wise in this price range is the Olympus E-510.I can't believe what I have been missing ! The colors with the K200D are just vibrant and nothing like the digicams. Right out of the box, with kit lens (DA 18-55 AL II), the pictures are sharp. The extra megapixels don't hurt either. I wish I had this camera years ago on my previous trip. Most of my old digicam pictures looked washed out to me now, especially with the older Olympus :(The ability to attach filters to the lens, such as a polarizer for outdoor use, greatly helps in the ability to enhance the picture and get incredible blue skies. That alone is worth getting a DSLR over a digicam.The shake reduction is great. It is basically impossible to get a blurry picture with this camera in daylight, except if you move it on purpose like crazy. At night time, it can still occur occasionally. And what's even better, since the SR is in the body, it works with all lenses that you attach to it, even 40 year old Pentax lenses made for 35mm film cameras ! The only other manufacturer to have in-body SR is Olympus, in some models.The camera is very fast. I verified that I can indeed take 2.8 pictures per second as advertised in continuous mode. There is never any noticeable waiting to save a 10 MP shot in JPEG mode, that is to say less than 1/3 of a sec. My Nikon could take several seconds to save a 6 MP JPEG onto SD, and my Olympus 30s for a 3 MP TIFF onto SmartMedia !One of my favorite cost-saving features is the AA battery support. This is what made my decision to buy the K200D over the Olympus E-510. With the K200D, there is no need to buy expensive proprietary batteries, that can only be used in one device, and will be obsolete for the next camera, or to carry another charger when traveling. Olympus also makes you purchase a quick charger. They only bundle a slow charger with the camera. Once you factor the extra charger and at least one spare battery, the 2 cameras are no longer in the same price range. AA batteries are available everywhere, and cheap NiMH rechargeables work great. I can use the same AA battery type for my flash and my DSLR and only have one charger. I was able to take 1600 pictures on a single set of 4 AA NiMH 2500 mAh batteries in continuous mode, including 100 with the built-in flash. That's way more than Pentax says I could (they claim only 700 with NiMH). This may be because I wasn't using the LCD due to the continuous mode. Even after that, I kept shooting with the same batteries for another week. They were not depleted. But the 1600 pics filled up all my cards so I thought it was time to stop the test.This camera is not perfect.It is heavier and larger than most of the competition. It will not fit in your pocket like a digicam, but then no DSLR with a lens attached will, either. The size and weight are somewhat mitigated by the fact this unit seems better built than others, and is weather-sealed, which means it will probably last longer.It doesn't have Live view. At this price, only Olympus has it, with the E-510. I won't miss this feature much. Actually, I missed the viewfinder in my Nikon Coolpix L1 digicam far more than I miss Live view on the K200D. It was difficult to compose shots on the L1 LCD in daylight without a viewfinder. So, I am very glad to have a viewfinder back now in the K200D. Live view would help a bit when using the tripod upwards, such as for moonshots with a big zoom lens. However, I have found the camera does very well handheld with the SR for those. And for tripod use, if the camera is in an awkward position, you can use a right angle finder - admittedly an extra expense and accessory to carry.Compared to other brands, it is also difficult to find new accessories, such as lenses and flashes, for this Pentax camera locally at stores, because many of them (I tried Ritz camera and Fry's electronics) do not carry anything Pentax. If you want new, then you have to order online. On the other hand, you don't have to buy new when there are plenty of used old lenses to go around on craigslist and ebay, that work perfectly fine, many of them manual mode, and some autofocus. I say the compatibility with old lenses means it's an environmentally friendly camera. :)If I had to choose again, I would make the same choice in a heartbeat.", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "SLEEPER VALUE OF THE YEAR", "Author": "S. Pettry", "ReviewID": "R3OI9SRGND0EL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been an amateur photographer since the late 70's and have always used Nikon cameras FM, F3 and later on a 995 digital Nikon. I always wanted to get into digital SLR's and I could never justify the price of the D100 D200 or D300 and the D40's and lower priced Nikon SLR's felt kind of cheap. I looked at other cameras in the price range of the K200D including Canon, Olympus and Sony and none of them had the build quality of the K200D with its stainless frame and weather sealed body. Also the shake reduction in the Pentax body sure beats having to buy expensive lenses such as the Nikon and Canon to get the same effect. The CCD is a carryover from the K10D which is a highly rated camera and the K200D shares many of the same features as the flagship Pentax K20D such as 2.7\" LCD, front programable RAW switch, the newly modified text in menu screens that did away with jibberish abbreviations and the CCD cleaning system which vibrates and you can take a picture of CCD to see where particles of dust are located. It's not a 100% accurate there are times you still have to blow off CCD with bulb blower, but there is a cleaning mode in which you can lock up mirror and not have to hold shutter open with bulb setting. The K200D uses AA batteries which I like, they are easily found. I have been using 2500mah rechargeable SONY NiMh and getting approx 800 shots from a full charge. You can add a battery grip and add 4 more batteries. The camera will switch from camera battery to grip battery when power is low which doubles the amount of shots. Plus grip has a vertical shutter button.  The kit lens is among the best kit lenses out there surpassing many with very clear shots and very good auto focusing.  The K200D has simple settings for the beginner and lots of manual control for advanced photographers. Very well laid out controls and very easy to understand. If you are familiar with 35mm SLR's it seems like a natural transition.  The only downside I see to this camera is fast multiple exposure shooting. If you are looking for strictly sports photography where you shoot 10 20 frames rapid series then this is not your camera.  Bottom Line for the majority of people looking for the best value at this price and even a little more, the K200D ranks at the top of the list.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent entry level DSLR", "Author": "M Kumar", "ReviewID": "REP9KVDSDW0KV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera for the past 3 months. My experience has been positive so far.Why K200D?* Built like a tank - No other entry level DSLR has this build quality* Weather Resistant - No other entry level DSLR has weather seals. You can take pictures outside in a dusty and rainy environment with a K200D and a DA* lens. Can you do this with a Nikon/Canon entry level camera?* Image stabilization  Shake Reduction  gives you two stop advantage. No more blurred images.* AA batteries  no need to carry charger, adapter etc  - around 800 images with flash* Built in Wireless Flash* Shoots RAW and JPEG simultaneously* Dust Removal and detection facilities* User selectable noise reduction levels* Good Ergonomics* Accurate color reproduction. Excellent IQ upto IS0 800.* Additional features like Exposure Bracketing, DOF preview, lens compatibility, spot metering etc.Unless you shoot sports action, you cannot go wrong with the PENTAX system. Unlike some other systems, PENTAX autofocus system never locks focus when the subject is not in focus. However, the focus lock is not lightning fast in low light ( i.e. after sunset) and it takes an extra second or two to lock focus. This is not the fault of this camera but PENTAX is yet to introduce a ring type ultrasonic focus lens. However, when it locks focus, it means the subject is in focus. No doubt about it.I bought this camera because of the excellent and comparatively cheaper primes available from PENTAX.  Ever heard about FA 31 limited lens? ( one of the 3 best autofocus lens in the world ever!) The primes are high quality and competes with Leica and Zeiss primes. They are very much affordable and are optimized for APS-C cameras. Most of the Nikon and Canon primes are full frame and the crop factor makes them not attractive. An 105mm Nikon prime lens is approximately 158 mm in APS-C. A PENTAX 70mm prime gives you the 105mm field of view on K200D which is the preferred focal length for portraits and it costs only [...]$. The Da 70mm lens is not made of plastic like the Canon 85mm f/1.8 and 100mm f/2 but it is an all metal lens which is again built like a tank. If you want a PENTAX quality prime lens from Canon,  you have to go for the CANON L prime lenses which are always above $1000. Visit [...] to know the list of all available lenses from Pentax . Look for lenses designated as \"Limited\".What about zoom lenses? You have weather sealed ultrasonic silent motor lenses like DA* 50-135 and DA* 16-50. They are cheaper compared to other systems. Also you have cheaper consumer build quality lenses like DA 55-300mm, DA 12-24, DA 16-45 etc.One other advantage of the PENTAX lenses is that they have special coating which controls flare very well. This is not the case with all other manufacturers.Let me reiterate: Only in PENTAX system, you can get professional quality lenses at affordable prices. No other manufacturer produces such high quality lenses that are so compact in size. Go for PENTAX.Update: Some dust got inside the camera while changing lenses. I was little worried as it showed up in the Dust Alert analysis. I repeated the dust removal option (it shakes the sensor, I believe, to remove the stubborn dust particles) multiple times.  Now it is 100% clean.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Brings a lot to play with", "Author": "urbandive", "ReviewID": "R3JP124CT22UKG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not a pro photographer, but my transition from a film reflex to a compact digital a few years ago was painful, I missed too much being able to bend the traditional limits of cameras, especially to take night pics. I finally convinced myself to get \"good\" digital camera. I hesitated a long time between the SLR-quality Sigma DP1, the tiny Olympus E-420 and this Pentax. The reasons for my final choice were a) the great first reviews, b) the quality of the build and \"ruggedness\" of the camera (seals, AA batteries), c) the availability of pancake lenses to limit bulkiness.I've had the camera for a week now. The first images came out beautiful and sharp. I also like the camera's programmability (define what each button does) and I think there is a lot to win by reading the manual thoroughly. At the moment I'm taking most pictures in RAW + JPG and fine-tuning the raw image if I think it deserves it, but I like the raw button which allows you to switch easily between file formats.Because I like tuning things myself, I don't use most of the \"easy\" functions, but they hardly ever are in my way.Overall, if you're going for a reflex, want good quality and don't mind a couple newbie-like features, I really recommend this camera.", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Adding To The ***** Bandwagon", "Author": "W. Nelson", "ReviewID": "R2ED3NKLUTALCK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have only had this camera for two days and it's everything I've wanted in a DSLR and more. I also almost got the K10 but it doesn't use the readily available rechargeable AA batteries which I have plenty of. The 10mp sensor is more than enough to get great big sharp enlargements. The grip on the camera is fantastic, I can't see it ever slipping from your hands unless you rub them with motor oil. I'm coming from a long line  of Fuji bridgecams I've own, including the 18x zoom s8000 that I also bought off Amazon, the quality difference is like night and day and the price I got for the Pentax makes me wonder why I even bought the former in the first place. If you want to spend anywhere from $200 to $700 more for a DSLR, be my guest but in my opinion your wasting your money, get this this camera and use the money you'll save to get your spouse a nice Mother's/Father's day gift so you won't have to sleep on the sofa because your lame excuses why you spent so much on a camera.

Especially compared to the Canon Digital Rebel XSi and Nikon D40! The Kit lens is also amazing, it's very sharp and has a decent manual focusing ring (Hoo-Ray!). Pentax also included a lens hood!The camera is very responsive when taking pictures as long as you give the camera a second or two after firing off four shots or so in quick succession, you will be fine shooting either JPEG or RAW.The autofocus is quick and reliable in most conditions, in low light it's a bit slower but still accurate most of the time, not as fast as Nikon or Canon's systems but darn close.Picture quality is absolutely amazing but if you want the best pictures you will undoubtedly have to use the more manual oriented modes and shoot RAW (PEF or DNG) the camera gives you several default image tones that you can customize to your liking when shooting JPEG. I'd recommend shooting in \"Bright\" image tone if you do not intend to post process your JPEG's, but if you do want to post process I would recommend shooting in \"Natural\" image tone.The auto WB can be a little off at times but the camera also has a whole bunch of white balance presets, so chances are you will find the preset to match the lighting conditions that you are shooting in and if you can't then you can use the custom WB which you can perfectly fine tune it if you want to.Battery life is also excellent, when using Energizer AA Lithium Ion batteries I got about 1,100 shots, which is what Pentax specifies the camera can do using Lithium Ion AA's. With Sanyo Eneloops Hybrid Ni-MH rechargeable batteries I was able to crank out about 850 shots which is truly amazing as well.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful prosumer DSLR", "Author": "Bindlestiff", "ReviewID": "R2LNRXBTRCFF40", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Extensive comparison between Pentax, Nikon, Sony, Olympus and Canon led me to pick the K200 as my first DSLR and after a few weeks of shooting it's starting to feel comfortable and so very much better than my old Canon point-and-shoot. Comments from a newbies perspective:The menus are truly a pleasure for older eyes.  Choosing the 'large' text only affects the line on which the cursor rests, so as not to overcrowd the display.  Both sizes of text are very readable. If you wear or need glasses, you'll like the menus.There are two menu systems to consider when operating the camera.  The 'Fn' button on the right brings up a smaller set of menus for ISO, white balance, and shooting 'mode' (single frame, burst mode, bracketing exposures & etc) and a few other functions that you will be most likely to need to access when shooting.  This allows you to dive into your most-needed settings without having to slog around in the larger full menu set.  Both menus are well designed to be shallow lists rather than deep trees.  Hurray Pentax!Ergonomics are good for me, a medium-to-large handed lefty.  As others mention, the camera is large and no lightweight.  Oddly (for such a big camera), the buttons on the 4-way controller ought to be a bit larger but it's very useable as-is.The kit lens is intended for generic use: it's not meant to be extremely good in low-light situations without flash, and if you're looking for a lot of zoom you'll be buying another lens shortly. It's a compromise, a good lense for most peoples daily usage.  There's nothing really 'wrong' with it, but it may not be the only lens you'll want to own.  The kit lens uses 52mm filters, while other lenses you eventually buy may use other sizes. You should get a UV filter and a polarizing filter right away and leave the UV filter on most of the time to protect the lens. Either of these filters can make a huge difference in the quality of your pictures, with the polarizing filter giving you the ability to 'dial out' glare and reflected or scattered light.You Will Read The Fine Manual. The Product Description section on Amazon that claims the K200D is 'as friendly as a simple point-&-shoot' is quite a stretch of the truth. The manual is pretty good, luckily.  Your best bet might be to set the camera up on a tripod indoors and actually work through any section that confuses you.  Hint: learn about using Aperture Priority and take series of shots that use f-stop to adjust depth of field.  I'm sure this camera works great as a point-and-shoot but that's probably not why you're spending this much; save the auto modes for things like urban photography where you're not always sure what's going to pop up next.The USB connection works fine connecting to my Asus F3J series laptop running Debian Linux, with the camera appearing as a hot-plugged USBFS file system.  Hurray for Linux!There are two 'Cons' against buying this camera.  There is no 'live' view through the LCD, though there is a 'preview' mode that displays a frozen frame.  So if you want to frame shots by looking through the LCD this might NOT be the camera for you.  I shoot through the viewfinder at all times so this is fine for me, but might really disappoint someone who expects to be able to see their shots lined up in the LCD and changing as they move the camera.The second possible issue is the USB connector. The end that plugs into the camera is a sort of micro-mini d-shaped connector.  The tiny jack on the camera is one exception to the 'built like a tank' design of the k200, and I'm not sure how it'll hold up.  It's so small that it's hard to tell when plugging in the cable which orientation is correct.  Maybe other cameras are no better, but I would have liked to see a larger, more robust connecter here even if it had to be proprietary. If you plan to remove the memory card when pulling your images this won't be an issue.I expect this camera to keep me confused and entertained for years, and feel very pleased and proud to have chosen it over other great entry-level DSLRs like the Olympus Evolt series, the Sony A series and the various Nikon D models.  Four AA batteries, rugged weather sealed construction, a reasonable price and a huge, easily legible LCD made this camera a winner for me.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Exact fit for old 35 mm user", "Author": "J. Martin", "ReviewID": "R35G945BMDZPDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced my older Pentax PZ-1p and ZX-7 35 mm SLRs with this camera. It has most of the professional features of the PZ-1p and many more auto features than my ZX-7.  The build quality is better than either one, with a steel inner frame and a weather sealed and tough, dense material for the body.  It is a good fit in my hand.  The kit lens is really spectacular, matching most fast glass primes in quality in regular light conditions.  The pictures I have taken are better than what I could do with 35mm.  Part of this is the ease of digital redundancy, but the detail of the 10.2 mp sensor is really breathtaking.  I can use all of my old Pentax lenses, even from the manual Pentax K1000 that I still own. BTW, that old K1000 manual SLR camera still works flawlessly, and is one reason I am such a Pentax fan.  The shake reduction is huge advantage over the older cameras, and since it is built into the body, the lenses are much less expensive that the Canon or Nikor equivalent. I have always thought Pentax glass is as good as the other , pricier brands.  This camera is great as a point and shoot or for more advanced users.12/16/08 The kit lens does need flash support in low light, so I added the SMC Pentax F/1.4 50mm prime.  The Pentax DA 55-300mm completes the kit.  After using Pentax k200d for 3 weddings (Pentax AF-540FGZ flash), a Disneyland trip, and some art photo work, I am very happy with the camera.  Learning the advanced settings has improved my photography a great deal.  I now almost never use the Auto settings anymore, and love the RAW+JPEG setting.  In very low light, and for macros, I turn off Auto focus.  When using older \"A\" lenses or manual lenses I use the M setting on the dial, and CUSTOM menu setting 23 allows use of the aperture ring.

Looking initially into the K20D, I decided to get the cheaper body of the K200D and invest in better lenses instead. The K200D felt very good in my hands, and its large and bright viewfinder is the best in its class. The availability of high quality and still affordable lenses with shake reduction built into the camera body was also a deal maker. Amazon and Adorama delivered in 2 days as promised.A couple of weeks after purchase I have a collection of some very nice shots, but still I'm a bit disappointed. Autofocus is unpredictable: sometimes the camera shoots lightning fast, even in burst mode, at other times is struggles to focus with no apparent reason, even with the prime 50mm f1,4 and the new 17-70 f4 zoom. This means that I miss some nice shots while the camera is focussing. When the camera finally does take a shot, I'd say 1 out of 3 shots is out of focus. I end up taking lots of photos hoping one of them will be right.TO be fair, when the K200D gets the focussing right, the results are very good. Colors are very natural, the exposure is always spot-on, and wireless flash (got the 360FGZ) works very well, too. The viewfinder is wonderful to work with.All in all, I'm not sure what to expect for this price. The K200D's speed is unstable compared to all other cameras I've used (digital and film). Too bad, but perhaps I'm just expeting too much.", "Date": "October 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great, solid, great pix, flexible, no jaggies", "Author": "N. Erath \"nerath\"", "ReviewID": "R2KRA8K8126Y74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are considering a DSLR I highly recommend it.I have been using my K200D for 4 months now and love it. I compared several cameras (Nikon D60, Canon EOS XTi, Olympus 520), and then ordered the K200D after reading many online reviews (DPReview, CameraLabs and others).This is my first DSLR, after having used a film SLR (Canon) for many years and digital point and shoot cameras (Kodak and Canon) for the last few.The Pentax feels so much more solid than the other DSLRs in my hands, a piece of real equipment. The camera's features were superior to the Nikon (tho you can never go wrong with Nikon), and the image quality per reviews and my experience has been great. The price point on Amazon made the decision a no-brainer, and I have not been disappointed.The camera operates in any range from point-and-shoot auto everything (including flash) down to full manual, and incorporates many scene modes in addition to the program, shutter priority, aperture priority, and fixed ISO program modes. Settings such as white balance (including custom WB), self timer, continuous shooting and more are rapidly accessed via the function button followed by one of the cursor keys, and there is a switch on the body at the base of the lens to switch to manual focus. Anti-shake is built into the body, keeping lenses simple, reliable and less expensive, a plus over Canon and Nikon. Sensor size is APS-C (a plus over Olympus), and I have read it is the same sensor used in the Nikon D60, which appears to be born out in online reviews.Only thing lacking IMO is a focus assist lamp for low light focusing, and that can be remedied with a Pentax external flash which has the focus assist lamp. Really it has been only in unfairly low light conditions where focus has failed me (dimly lit indoor displays viewed from a moving cart - like some of the dimmest portions of rides in Disney World). If you are bent on live view that is not here either, but realize live view as implemented on DSLRs has many limitations anyway. The viewfinder on the K200D is very good, BTW, and it is a better tool than live view - with the exception perhaps of the occasional shot with the camera held far away from your face, perhaps shooting over a crowd.I have read some comments that the JPGs produced by the K200D at default settings are overly sharp, exhibiting \"jaggies\" on edges. I have tried a few times to reproduce this to see how changing the JPG quality settings would affect it, but have been unable to see the effect at all. BTW the same article indicated shooting RAW the K200D was fantastic - if you process your photos on the PC and don't mind the extra storage for RAW, then the JPG issue is moot.Added bonus: if you have other Pentax K mount lenses they will work here, and if you have the older screw mount M42 lenses there are K mount adapters available to make them work too. So unlike the Canon FD glass cluttering my closet, your old Pentax lenses are still much more than paper weights. Browse ebay and see how many older Pentax lenses are available for a great price if you can handle manual focus for those special times you need the lens, like for low light. And - unlike Canon or Nikon - Pentax's in-body image stabilization still works with the old lenses! If you have Pentax-A lenses, exposure is still fully auto and only focus is manual - not bad at all.[...]", "Date": "September 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal camera for the price", "Author": "Michael Bruno \"M. Bruno\"", "ReviewID": "RPX1XR07W6J2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Pentax K200d through Amazon at the end of July 08, and recently returned from a 47 day trip to the great American West.  I took nearly 2,600 photos under a wide variety of conditions: dust, rain, surf, museums, near freezing mountain camping, bright sun and twilight.  I am still on my second set of lithium batteries.  The original batteries that came with the camera were good for over 1400 exposures (with very little flash usage).  The results are amazing with superb color saturation and definition.  And the camera is tough, much tougher than I expected.  It feels good to hold.I am principally familiar with less expensive Nikon DSLRs, the D40, D50, D60 and D70.  The Pentax is far above these fine cameras.  I am not talking about the K20d, which I understand is even more remarkable.  At under $600 including a quality 18-55 kit lens, it is, to say the least, a bargain compared to other offerings in a very competitive field.I have been slow to break away from the world of 35mm.  However, digital has more than caught up in terms of image quality, and it has surpassed film in terms of convenience and cost.  With that in mind, I set aside my Nikon FM2 and lenses and after considerable soul searching, turned to Pentax.  In 1975, I had owned a screw mount body and later a Pentax ME, which I loved but lost to a camera snatcher.  In the `80s, I turned to Nikon, and still believe that, overall, they provide excellent products.  So I have a hand full of Pentax K and Nikon A1 lenses, which I hoped to be able to use.I was considering an upgrade to a Nikon D80, and checked it out.  The D80 was a fine camera back in 2006, but it seems a bit dated now.  The Pentax K200d feels better in my hands, much better.  The Pentax has both shake reduction in the body and a dust management system, both of which are lacking in the Nikon, and Pentax offers some marvelous new prime lenses, including a 50mm f1.4, made for dslr bodies.  My old Pentax K-mount lenses work wonderfully well and provide and inexpensive alternative.  [In the K200, you just have to go to Custom Menu, item 23 to enable the older lenses.]  After some initial experimentation, however, I stuck mostly with the 18-55 kit lens, quick, versatile and also dust and weather resistant.  Moreover, with the shake reduction, I have been able to hand hold with good results at 1/15th of a second or even less depending on the focal length.  Perhaps soon I will add the 50-200, or a nice prime lens.You can't go wrong with this camera.As of July 5, 2009, the only complaint I have is the auto-focus tends to \"search\" with some difficulty in low light situations.  Otherwise, it is a remarkable instrument.  Since the above review, I have shot hundreds of photos including a wedding and many portraits.  The results have been excellent.  I added two lenses, a Pentax 50 1.4 for low light and portrait applications and the Pentax 50-200 for travel, wildlife and sports.  Results exceeded my expectations, and the camera has held up through rain, snow and wind blown sand.

Griffey", "ReviewID": "R212KSXH4GZNNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my k200d today after many weeks of reading online reviews and a couple trips to the camera shops close to my house.  Coming into the dSLR world with no stock in glass from any manufacturer, I was less restricted in my choices and looked at everything from the Pentax I ended up with to the Canons, Nikons, and Sonys I heard everyone else talking about purchasing.  The most important features to me were image quality, build quality, in body stabilization, and AF speed.  I kept hearing others talk about frames per second and live view, but for the images I will be capturing with my camera, these two features were not that important to me.  Out of the box, I could not be happier with my selection, especially considering its current price point.First and foremost, you can tell once you hold it in your hands you are dealing with a camera that has exceptional build quality.  The entry level dSLR's I tried at the camera shops (Canon Rebel Xsi and Nikon d60) felt, well, entry level.  The build quality of k200d compares admirably to the feel of the Canon 40d or Sony a700.  The weather and dust seals also sold me on the k200d as I plan to use it on outdoor weekends in Colorado and the Grand Canyon this summer.  The metal lens mount on the body and the kit lens also showed me the importance Pentax places on build quality.  I'm confident this camera will last for years based strictly on build quality and feel.The image quality has impressed me out of the box as well.  I have taken close to 60 pictures with the camera trying to experience the different settings and learn a little more about dSLRs (I've always used a point and shoot digital camera before today).  With my limited knowledge of photography and the abilities of the k200d, the quality of the images I've been able to capture is outstanding.  The 10 MP and PRIME image processing really do capture a bunch of detail, and the image stabilization seems to keep the noise down even at higher ISO's.  I'm sure as I progress in my knowledge of the camera the images will only become better, and I am anxious to put this camera to use to see what it can do.  The autofocus seems to be quick and accurate.  Something else I liked is the consideration Pentax gives to being back-compatible with older lenses.  Though I didn't have any pre-existing glass, I like knowing that my k200d body is something that can grow with Pentax technology in the future.For those considering their first dSLR, I wouldn't get caught up too much on resolution.  For most of us, 8 to 10 MP is going to be more than enough, and I would imagine around 3 fps is going to be more than we enthusiast need.  I was tempted to purchase a semi-pro body fearing that I was going to want \"more\" one day in the future.  I can honestly say I am glad I did not spend the extra 500-600 dollars on a semi-prO body for my first dSLR.  The k200d has impressed me from the beginning and I am confident it will be with me in the future, either as my main camera or a great backup to my Pentax k20d.  I paid roughly 660 on Amazon and will get 100 bucks back through a Pentax rebate.  For 560 dollars, anyone would be hard pressed to find as good of an entry-level dSLR as the Pentax k200d.", "Date": "June 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "improvement over the 100D", "Author": "Alice Twombly \"eclectic reader\"", "ReviewID": "RSVROH02VWFA2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was given a gift of the Pentax100D not a year ago; in March I tried to buy the same camera for my son. It was already out of stock and replaced by the 200D which had combined features of the 100D with the 10D now also obsolete. In comparing the two cameras one can see the improvements in the newer camera: instead of 6 megapixels this camera has 10 megapixels, an advantage for the serious camera buff who wants to have safe blow ups larger than 8x 10. The switch to RAW format is also more easily accomplished than on the 100D. Additionally, while the ISO ratings on the 100D go from 200-3200, the 200D starts at 100, an advantage in bright light, although the maximum rating is 1600--on the theory I suppose that it might be more desirable to have more flexibility in high light scenarios than need it for very low light situations. Another improved feature is the viewing screen on the back of the body. It is fractionally larger than the 100D but it improves clarity. I didn't have a chance to examine all of the improvements in viewing and adjusting the camera however there are more editing features on the 200D than the 100D.I was also delighted to see that every old lens my son had including an old Pentax doubler, worked fine with this camera. There was enough of a difference that, although I really like my camera, I wish I had the features I listed above of the newer one. The only drawback is the price; it was $100 higher at the same time this year than the 100D was last year, +/- $760 with lens and body-- although as I have been tracking the camera the price has been dropping and I got the 200D on a promotion, but it was still higher than I wanted to pay at the outset.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be much happier", "Author": "Daniel Wickham \"danielp\"", "ReviewID": "R3GBR8T6R3JE1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pentax K200D 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction (Body Only)Let me add to the positive reviews for this camera, and please realize I am a picture taker, not a commercial Pro, so my viewpoint may differ a bit. I have had Pentax cameras since the sixties in one form or another. I have also had Canons, and Nikons. This is not to put down any of them, I just think Pentax stands side by side with the best of them.This model, K200d< will make most anyone very happy with the results. If you do your part, it will do it's part. If the default settings for \"vividness-sharpness-contrast-etc) aren't to your liking they can easily be changed. ISO from 100-1600 are very useable. Even at 1600 the noise is minimal, not like most \"point and shoots\" where anything above 200 shows noticable to severe static. (that is one of the biggest advantages of a DSLR--you can shoot in light that would stop you otherwise) The shake reduction may not be the miracle that Pentax claims, but it is a great tool and will save some otherwise lost/blurred shots. Just don't expect to use a 400mm lens at dusk, handheld, unless you are a statue.This model has been criticized for having to use the menus instead of a readily available dedicated wheel, or button. True, The K20 is nicer in that way, with the extra control wheel, and such. BUT, most of us will find our favorite settings in the menus and leave them pretty much alone. If you are using AV or TV modes, it isn't difficult to use a finger, and your thumb at the same time, unless you fall down a lot while trying to walk and chew gum at the same time. This is something a pro would use all the time, so it is a THING to them, but not a biggie for the average guy/gal, at least it has been a big 0 in the \"pita\" category for me.You can also readjust your shots in the camera, to a degree. Or shoot RAW and you can really readjust shots. Some claim you need to shoot RAW to get nice resolution, or colors. I shoot jpeg 90% of the time, and my shots (if I do my part) are very colorful, and resolution is not a problem. If I were shooting a wedding, I will use RAW as a precaution, but have not found it necessary. If you prefer RAW, then by all means it is there for you. Some say Pentax always tends to under expose. Well, they do, but you can lighten up an image if need be to correct it, many Nikon shots get blown out by bright colors, and that is hard to impossible to fix. Both cameras (and canon-panasonic-sony-etc) also let you + or - the compensation to fix whatever you see as a problem, so if you think it underexposes set it +1, and try that. If it over exposes try -1 and try that until you are where you want to be. In short this will do just about anything you need to do. You can go AUTO, and be very happy once you set it up, or you can be as creative as you can be. The K20 offers a few helpful things to the Pro, but not much useable for the general population. The extra MP's aren't needed for general pictures or most any pictures. The only thing I really wish the K200d had is a \"light up\" lcd on the top of the camera, I find that would be beneficial to me. The K20 has it, but at another 500 bucks or thereabouts. I'll suffer through. Until I win the lottery, this is my baby, and I love her. As Mom always said \"try it, you'll like it\"I did get the battery grip for it. It gives you more to grip, thought this camera is quite comfortable to my hand.Also it has an EV lock, and shutter button on the ends for ease of use in different positions.Battery life with rechargeables, and lithium is great. Shoot all day, with flash, and screen under most situations. The grip will hold four more AA's to double the life. That is another thing I like, some don't. I like the AA battery power. They are easy to get in an emergency. Dedicated batteries are nice, but try to find one for your camera in a town with no camera shop. Even then a camera shop with Pentax cameras. Pentax, the inventors of so many firsts, and I think the one company that likes photography above gadgets, not that they can't make a gadget. My friend has Nikons, and he does some really nice work with them, but he spent big bucks on lenses,(the lens is the secret, not the camera as far a clarity goes) where I use kit lenses, and many of my old Takumars-M-A lenses, and screw m42s. You can use them all, even Ricoh has mounts for Pentax.(and some Sears) Just remember to take out the Ricoh locking pin (easy with a small screwdriver) or the lens will get stuck on your camera.

The jpegs straight out of the camera are great and you can extensively customize the several picture modes available to deliver the jpegs exactly the way you like them. When you graduate to shooting raw, you will find that the raw files have a lot of headroom for recovering highlights.The solid compact body has excellent build quality with extensive weather sealing. The dust-alert feature is quite helpful and the dust reduction works very well. I recommend one of the Giotto blowers as an accessory, but I have only had to use mine once so far, despite changing lenses frequently.The 18-55mm AL II kit lens stands above the most of the competition both optically and mechanically (for example has a stainless steel bayonet mount) and is flare-resistant and quite sharp when stopped down a couple of stops. The icing on the cake with this camera is how well set up it is for use with legacy manual focus lenses. The shake reduction is in the camera so all lenses you use can take advantage of it.I use Sanyo Eneloop hybrid AA batteries and get between about 500 and 700 images per charge.This camera has lots of pros, more than I have listed here, it's hard to think of any cons - the SD card was difficult to extract until someone showed me to use the fingernail groove at the top of the cards.

I live in the pacific northwest and spend a great deal of time outdoors so this is a must. You simply cannot get weather sealing in other brands of DSLRs until you spend around $1000+.  Second, This camera is compatible with all of my old manual focus lenses.  That means I don't need to spend MORE money replacing all of my old Pentax lenses, many of which have outstanding image quality. Just because a lens was made 20+ years ago doesn't mean it isn't any good. This is much more convenient and economical than other brands that change their lens mounts every five years or so. Because this camera has in-body shake reduction (something that Canon and Nikon DO NOT have)  ALL of my old Pentax lenses can take advantage of this feature.

I heva read many, many reviews about this Camera, visited \"well known\" electronic store here in in NYC to get a \"feeling\" of this baby.

A few years later, the K200D came out, it was competitively priced and had most of the great K10D features. I cut my losses and traded the K100D in for the K200D. I am very pleased with it. The reasons for the trade were for the following features:+ Remote flash: I've always wanted this feature that Nikon users take for granted, it doesn't work as great and sometimes doesn't detect the controlling flash. But when within range and everything, it works and am very happy to finally have it.+ Weather seals: sure, it's not bullet proof and doesn't help the lenses at all. But I used to not take my camera out when weather conditions were not fair. The same goes for my friends with canons and nikons. With the K200D, I have no fears of taking it out and actually USING it. I know, it's totally a psychological thing, but the peace of mind is still a feature to me.+ Sensor cleaner: The anti shake feature is also used to shake off the dust in the K200D, it doesn't really work, I never notice it shaking anything off. But I also set it to shake upon power up. I also have a Giottos rocket blower, the combination seems to keep the K200D relatively dust free. Much more so than my K100D. I know it's not just the weather seals because I know the dust is getting in when I change lenses.+ Better WB & PRIME engine: the color control is much better in the K200D, an immense improvement and main reason for the upgrade.+ Shoots in DNG format: I am no longer tied to Pentax's photolab SW. I can now use photoshop without any plugins or upgrades. Very good feature.The things I miss on the K100D:- Battery power seems more finicky on the K200D, I had to switch to Eneloops, which allows me to get 1000+ images per charge. AMAZING, but sad that it only performs with Eneloops.- The images look under exposed and overly contrasted. These features can be offset easily, but it does take some time to get used to and learn to work around. Once you learn its behavior, it is very predictable and linear.- My external flash no longer gets perfect exposure every time in any condition. For some reason, the K200D works terribly with the FGZ540. It is very easy to under or over expose an image. I am not sure if this is because I shoot in ISO100 vs K100D's ISO200. But the end result is I can no longer turn on the FGZ and just shoot. I have to manually set the flash zoom. The flash exposure setting doesn't seem to do anything either. I've gone on forums to see if I have a defective K200D, but in the end, I've moved on and have accepted the issue.I am very very happy with the K200D, as the DSLR market gets more and more competitive, I still find the K200D completely usable for all my needs. If you want a DSLR that just works out of the box, you should stick with canons and nikons. Pentax is really for the dedicated and people with a pentax lens collection. Feature for feature, pentax always loses to canons and nikons, but it is still more than enough for anyone who is serious about photography. Especially if you've done film photography, I feel that Pentax replicates the film camera experience better than all other brands. Its simplicity and attention to detail gives it that classic feeling. While other brands focus on speed, specs and little functions that make it completely and totally feel... digital. I do envy those features some times. When I see my friends shoot in 800 or 1600ISO with no noise at all, I am jealous. But then, you really can't do that with film either.

I've read alot of reviews and all the experts agree this is the best. It was made for the camera that is one step up from this  model--but it's included with the K200D as well. 5)Pentax has an awesome PRIME lens for under $200 (amazon) that everyone raves about.

(12MP JPEG, 10%flash,little screen use).The next set were Alkaline batteries and gave me 200 shots. So stay away from Alkaline's. Make sure to get the battery grip BG3 and 2 sets of high capacity NIMH's. The camera is quite compact compared to Nikon's but slightly larger than comparable Canon's. I have large hands as I'm 6'6\" and I really need the battery grip to have a good feel on the camera.

Now I get about 900 images with a normal 2GB SD card and one set NiMh's GP 2700mA. I think the SDHC cards use more power, stay away from them if you don't need the capacity.All in all, very satisfied Pentax customer and feel happy everytime I go out and use it.

I've only shot around 500 images so far--still have a lot to learn about how to get the best results--but already I've gotten some great pics from it.  A few pros and cons of the camera from what I've seen so far:Pro:-Good kit lens, sharp.-Good in body image stabilization (I've taken some wide angle shots hand held at 1/10th second with no trouble!)-Built like a tank!  This thing feels like a very solid piece of equipment.-Runs on AA batteries.  Huge plus in my opinion.  A good set of rechargeables like the Sanyo Eneloops will probably be my next purchase.  AA batteries are great because you can find them at virtually any store if you get caught with no juice.-Logical control layout; easy to quickly change settings.-Great image quality overall, even at high ISO!  It does take some learning to produce the best results, especially if you are not familiar with things like aperture, shutter speeds, exposure compensation, etc.  Of course you always have the auto mode to fall back on, but I try to avoid this as much as I can - trial and error with the other settings seems to be teaching me a lot more about the camera and photography in general.Con:-Automatic white balance is rather poor when shooting indoors.  This seems to be true of other SLRs that I have used too.  The different settings (fluorescent, tungsten, etc.) can help here, but indoor lighting can still be tricky, especially when light is coming from two different types of bulb at the same time.  My advice is to take a few shot at different white balance settings and see what looks the best to you.  Also, a gray card is very useful for setting manual white balance, which in my experience has been the most accurate and pleasing to look at.-No backlight for the top LCD screen.  A minor annoyance.But at least this camera has a top LCD, as the entry level Canons and Nikons and others do not.-No live view.  Not really an issue for me at all, though I could see why others would not like this especially if they are used to point and shoots.I know there are many more things that can be said about the camera but these are just a few which I have noticed so far.

This Pentax K200D camera does an amazing number of things well.  Settings are easy to use, and it does very, very well just as a point-and-shoot on \"automatic\" setting.  The pictures are extremely nice in colors and detail.I am by no means a professional - I am still re-learning what a lot of those settings mean.  The camera does not overwhelm you with a zillion things, but does give you choices.  OR there are a lot of basic Scene modes, that do seem to work decently well, if you don't want to try to do the white balance, etc, on your own.  For an amateur like myself, who has to bend my brain to try to remember what those things are at all, it is a great way to pick it up without being overwhelmed with a professional camera.  And there have been times when I don't have time to try out these things, so I just put it on automatic and let it figure it out as I switch from bright sunshine, inside a darker space, etc.The megabytes mean there is a lot of info in each picture - using Photoshop to crop or play with the picture results in some spectacular shots when I need it.  Recently, I had to take pictures under a large picnic pavilion, without using a flash but with all the bright sunshine outside.  The camera did well, and Photoshop was easily able to get me the detail I needed on the inside shots, balancing out the very bright background.  Not every camera has pictures that have enough detail to pull a good shot out of those details.  The same thing happened at a school assemble - good shots under difficult conditions. The only problem pictures I have had are NOT the camera's fault - people moving when I do not have it in sports mode.  Putting it in sports mode does indeed help if things are going to move around on you.I am satisfied with the shutter lag - it's pretty fast - and the quality of the camera. I am particularly happy that my 20 year old Pentax lense works with this.  It was the reason I bought the camera, in the end - the ability to use the old lenses from my old Pentax film camera,  and even the additional flash (also ancient).  Pentax has made it so you can use them, and even makes an adapter for the really old lenses. This makes upgrading to other lenses so much easier, as there are a lot of older lenses around.

Researched several, especially Nikon and Canon Rebel Xi types. But when I went to my local camera store, the very experienced salesman suggested the Pentax K200D. When I mentioned that Nikon and Canon seem to be the preferred models, he said, \"Ford and Chevy sell more cars than Mercedes, but are you going to buy based on high volume or quality?\" So, after well over an hour of looking at the first two brands we looked at the Pentax, and I was soon sold.First I need to tell you what I don't like about the Pentax compared to my Olympus: the loss in zoom power. The 550UZ had an 18X capability, the highest at the time on a high-end point and shoot. While I bought a used zoom for the Pentax, I would have to spend considerably more to get where the Olympus got me. But I can live with this for now.As to the Pentax:1) more metal than the Canon/Nikon, making lens to body contact more secure and solid; less plastic to break while hiking, etc. and which gives you that \"cheap\" feel due to lack of heft2) uses all older Pentax lenses which saves you money if you have these3) while some consider the lack of live view a drawback (and I have this on the Olympus and consider it a nice feature), I find the Pentax forces me to pay closer attention to what I'm doing in both composition and focusing. I can still make adjustments with the next pic if reviewing the one I just took shows a problem, but I'm finding fewer problems with the increase in the care I take in making each photo.4) the price! Got more bang for the buck with this camera than the others could provide, and other reviews here have well covered the features of this camera that you'd have to spend alot of money for in higher end brands.5) everything about this camera spells out \"pro.\" It feels like a serious camera and also performs like one. Picture quality is excellent. While the Olympus has many features of an SLR (manual focus, adjustments for aperture, ISO, f/stop, etc.), I find I use these features more on the Pentax, and they are easier to use, understand, and keep track of what you are doing. You avoid falling into the \"auto\" mode rut - why spend hundreds of dollars for an \"automatic\" camera when you can take much better photos setting things yourself?I could go on, but I think you get the message.

Its a great dSLR and I purchased it mostly because of the value pentax offers for the price(especially the built in shake reduction).Cons:-I am annoyed that there is not a dedicated button for the changing the shooting mode(single, continuous, timer, remote control, auto bracketing).  Everytime I want to use the remote, or the self timer, I have to press the function button, then navigate the menus.  It isn't a big deal, but it adds a second or two to something that should take only 2 seconds to begin with.-this camera does not have an intervalometer.  I was used to taking time lapse photographs with my previous 2 cameras, and I was surprised that this camera does not have this function.  I imagine that an intervalometer can be implemented by software very easily, so I assume that it was left out so that more advanced photographers would pay more for the K20D.Pros:-The shake reduction really works very well.  I've taken 1 second test shots handheld and the blur was reduced dramatically.  The shake stabilization does however emit a high frequency sound compared to the optical stabilization systems used by canon.-The build quality of this camera is top rate.  Most people don't appreciate build quality these days, but if you just pick this thing up and handle it, you'll realize that it is built to last.  Modern electronics usually go obsolete before anyone notices the build quality, but pentax took the bet that some people do notice a difference.  It helps me have a peace of mind to know that the camera is splash proof and dust proof.Photokina 2008 has come and gone.  Nikon and canon both have released dSLRs with video capability.  I bought my camera in june 2008, and now with the current camera marketin october 2008, I would still have chosen the K200d for the price.  I enjoyed the high quality video capabilities of my canon powershot S3 and I hope that when I replace my dSLR in about 5-10 years, pentax will have a competitive dSLR with 1080P video capability.  If price wasn't an issue, I would get the canon 5D mark II with 1080P video, but since money is an issue, I am very very happy with the K200D.For anyone with a budget large enough to buy the K200D or K20D dSLR with a few lenses, the unanimous advice I've found online was to purchase a cheaper dSLR with higher quality lenses.  Lenses will maintain their value over a long period of time because lens technology does not advance as fast as electronics technology.  Some pentax lenses like the 31mm f1.8 prime is considered by many as THE best autofocus lens ever made.  If you want another reason to go for pentax, that would be it- The best pentax prime lenses are also the best lenses that money can buy.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great first DSLR", "Author": "M.

However, for my portraits and landscapes the camera sets the pics up nicely, is able to view them well on its large LCD display, and is able to do minor edits before loading to my PC.The Pentax's 10.2 effective MPs means that the camera is very much up to par with its competition.  However it does not yet feature direct view that can be found on some competitor's models.  Also somewhat of a drawback is that the camera does not come with a rechargeable battery - it uses 4 AAs.  You can stretch your battery life by buying the optional battery grip, but I have found so far that the battery life is exceptional.  So far I have taken hundreds of pics without putting a dent in the battery performance.Pentax continues to produce good cameras for average users and I recommend the K200D.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "ALL THE RESEARCH WAS WORTH IT", "Author": "Navy Chief, Retired \"Dean\"", "ReviewID": "R3HF00JI65CV8I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a very active 35mm amateur many years ago and just sort of feel into the point and shoot mode.

I didn't believe in this camera I never heard of but I went home and compared it to the rest. The K200D has everything I wanted and then some.

I am a dentist and I use this camera to take portrait and close-up photos almost every day.  My K200D is combined with a ring flash and a Sigma 105 macro lens.  I also bought the 18-55mm lens in case I want to use it outside the office.It is easy to use and takes beautiful, high resolution pictures that you can crop and enlarge with great results.I chose this camera over the Sony, Nikon, Canon and Olympus SLR's for several reasons.I need to take photos quickly and I need to take them all now.  I can't wait for a dead battery to recharge.  The K200D uses AA batteries.  If the rechargeable AA NiMH batteries are dead, I can take them out and temporarily replace them with standard batteries quickly.The K200D uses an SD card as well as some of my other digital cameras, digital storage devices and my camcorder. My computer has a built-in SD slot so this simplifies my data storage needs.Since I hand-hold my camera I wanted a camera with image-stabilizing.  The K200D has this feature built into the body, not the lens, so the number of lenses available is greater and the cost of lenses is less and I always have this feature available.If you read reviews on Amazon or other Web pages you may see criticism regarding brightness or color issues with the K200D.  I haven't found this to be a problem.  If you don't agree with the engineers at Pentax who calibrated the camera you should be aware there are many simple adjustments available to change the brightness or color settings from the Fn menu, Custom Image options and you can have photos \"Your Way\" from then on.Since I shoot in M or Manual mode I use the Auto Bracketing feature all the time. All I have to do is push the Shutter button 3 times and one of the exposures will work. The first shot is what I think should work, the 2nd is darker and the 3rd is lighter.The K200D can take excellent photos for beginners in the simplest mode and can be highly adjustable for the demanding seasoned photographer.  I use the camera for work because it is a fine tool and has the features I need, but all digital SLRs are big and heavy for me.  I am no longer interested going on vacation carrying 3 or 4 lbs of camera, batteries and lens over my shoulder waiting for that Kodak moment.

When I first purchased the camera, the auto focus sporadically stopped working for brief moments with the symptoms progressively worse over time and eventually (auto focus) stopped working all together. I sent the camera off for warranty repair. Upon receiving the camera back, the auto focus symptoms immediately started to happen again and then again (auto focus) died.The colors are pleasantly inaccurate -- that's correct, the colors are off but with a nice interpretation that tend to skew on the saturated side. That's the charm of the K200d I learned to like. Also, unless you are shooting in ideal lighting the pictures are on the underexposed side - not much of an issue since I shoot in RAW.I'm thoroughly impressed with the customer service department; I've spoken to them over the phone and through the \"live chat\" many times. Each time, I've received a conclusion and each time the representatives are knowledgeable and friendly.When the camera works, I love it.

It has so much flexibility and so many features.  I had a Pentax K1000 film camera that I just loved (still do).  The K200D will take all my old lenses.  I have to manually focus, but the K200D will adjust exposure to the set aperture and with the right setting will even take the picture with the shutter depressed only when you have the correct focus.It uses AA batteries, awesome!  Reviewers critcize this feature which makes no sense to me.  I know that in 10-20 years I will be able to find AA batteries, lithium or rechargable, anywhere.  A proprietary battery pack with a proprietary charger like so many of the other DSLR's?  Good luck finding those even 5 years from now.  I bought some 2500 mah recharchable AA's that last for over 500 shots at least (mostly non-flash).The 18-55mm AL II kit lens is very versatile and clear, produces great pictures.  18mm Digital is ~28mm or wide angle for film so I've captured some great landscapes, turned around, zoomed it in the 55mm and gotten a great face pic of my kids.No, this camera does not have live view and does not shoot video, but that is not photography in the traditional sense.  Looking through the viewfinder is natural and gives you realistic composition, especially in strong sunlight.  I've tried live view DSLR's and they drove me crazy, especially in sunlight where composing a picture became difficult.  Shooting video with a DSLR is like shooting still photography with your videocamera - yuck.The K200D has a very solid body, is weather sealed, and after a year of constant use has proved to be a tank like my old Pentax K1000.  Did I mention it takes \"RAW\" in PEF or DNG format with the click of a button and the quality of the pictures is outstanding?  10 Megapixels is enough resolution to print most any size picture other than billboards, and going to higher megapixels only makes the file sizes larger to work with.Go for it.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good, but not as good", "Author": "Siva", "ReviewID": "R2ALC48ET1HC7I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly, I wanted to give it 3.5 stars, not 4.I have mentioned below the main camera features, it's rating and a bgjustification. These are the most important points to be considered with respect to the other cameras in competition (Canon XSi and Nikon D60).1.Weather proof body(4/5):Excellent feature for the price. But, it is of no use without a weather-ressistant lens. But Pentax has recently (May 2009) released 2 weather ressistant lenses (18-55 and 50-200mm) under $250 each. These lenses were not available when I purchased the camera.2. Image stabilization (4/5): The Pentax shifts it's sensor to compensate for the shake, unlike Canon and Nikon (they shift the lens elements). Since the shake reduction is in the body, any kind of lens (cheap ones, old ones, etc.) can be attached to the camera body and IS can be acheived. Hence, lenses are cheaper for the Pentax. Whereas in Canon and Nikon, the IS (or VR=Vibration Reduction as Nikon calls it)lenses are costly. But the quality of IS is a little better in Canon (no idea about Nikon).3. Picture quality (4/5): The picture quality is just like any other camera. The contrast is on the higher end and I like it that way. It makes the pictures ready for printing. I went out with my friend who had a Canon XSi. My pictures looked far better than his when we compared them. The Canon pictures looked dull because they are more natural and the contrast is well balanced. The Canon pictures are a bit (about 10%) sharper than the Pentax.Overall, no regrets with the picture quality. It is almost \"awesome\"!4. Lens compatibility (5/5): If you are planning to use a varitey of lenses, then you are in luck! The K200D is compatible with every single Pentax lens produced till date (some older lenses require an additional mount) Also, the lenses are cheaper compared to Canon and Nikon. There are also third party manufacturers like Sigma and Tamron.5. Other features: There is no need to review the other features like RAW, LCD, Menu, Modes, etc. since they are pretty much the same in all the cameras.Although, please note that this camera does not come with \"live view\", i.e., the LCD does not show the image while you try to capture it. You need to use the viewfinder to see what you are capturing. You may review your picture in the LCD only after capturing it.It feels like a pro camera, but with the feel comes the weight. It also has a small LCD display on the top of the body which are usually present in pro and semi-pro cams. But this LCD cannot be used in situations with low lights since the LCD is not back-lit.CONCLUSION: I would recommend this camera if first 4 features are very important for you(Weather resistant, lens compatibility, cheap lenses and ready to print pics). The bad part is that it lacks \"live view\" and video capture. I can live without these. Overall, I am extremely happy with the output (pictures).

Its my first DSLR camera, and I am very happy with it. I did a lot of research, and comparisons with Canon and Nikon. Once I decided on Pentax, I had trouble deciding between Pentax K10D and K200D. After a lot of research, I chose K200D, for the following reasons:1. Both offer the same features and functions, but K200D is cheaper.2. The only key differences between the 2 are that K10D has a pentaprism viewfinder, whereas K200D has a pentamirror. This doesnt cause any change to the quality of pics taken. The second is that K10D, being the prosumer camera, has most of its functions adjustable manually without having to go into the menu. In K200D, these must be set in the menu settings. Again, no big deal. Just a convenience.3. K10D is heavier than K200D. For an outdoor person like myself, the weight is an important factor when I am walking on rough and uneven trails for many hrs. With the bag, and camera around your neck, and your friends hurrying you up, you dont want a very heavy camera.4. K200D is a camera released 2 years after K10D. Its most likely that there are improvements in the software, bugs fixed, if any.5. K10D only has manual modes. K200D has both preset modes and manual. I see no harm in having the preset modes, even though I dont intend to use them. Might help when I have little time to setup and shoot.The K200D camera itself is a very beautiful camera, easy to hold and use. It has a robust design, and great performance, under all conditions. ITs even water and dust resistant. The image stabilization function is very useful. The camera has a pretty big image viewer, which shows high and low contrast areas in the image. Useful function.Some usability issues I noticed was that the function button used for selecting ISO, number of frames, etc, turns off the screen as soon as you select.

It will take any AA including rechargeables (though they claim they aren't recommended for best function I haven't had a problem and regular throw aways).I bought this camera because it is in a lower price range for its features-- most other lines only offer shake reduction built into the body of the camera in the next price range along with the huge amount of preset picture modes and options for creativity (the advanced modes).I haven't found the dials as easy to use as friends' Canon's (I can pick them up and change the settings without knowing their cameras)but I like this camera better, and the same product is available for a cheaper price. It also fits my set of PENTAX 35mm lenses which is a no brainer and a unique quality.I say this is a better camera than its similarly priced competitors by far, esp. with the functions.

Although I miss some aspects of the P&S;, overall I'm extremely pleased with the K200D. It has a host of features that are lacking from other entry level cameras. Among these are: support for a wide variety of old lenses; in-camera shake reduction; wireless flash capability; SD card; AA battery power; weather sealing; dust removal; pixel mapping; RAW+JPEG. On the negative side: it's missing live-view, a video mode, and is limited in number of continuous shots. * K mount and in-camera shake reduction: these were the main reason why I decided to go with Pentax. I was looking for a deal on an XSi when this showed up. After some additional research, I decided to abandon the Canon and go with Pentax. My first (non-kit) lens was a 50mm f1.7 manual lens. It's near perfect for < $40. I've also learned that Pentax's shake reduction works in three dimensions: horizontal, vertical, and rotational. Other systems lack the rotational dimension. * Wireless flash: sort of lucked into this one. I bought the AF360FGZ to go along with the K200D and found out that it supports wireless operation with the AF360FGZ. This feature almost covers the cost of the flash. Me likey! * SD card: I have a bunch of SD cards and prefer it to other formats. I do need to buy faster and higher capacity cards, though. * AA power: Sanyo Eneloop. Enough said. * Weather sealing: not essential for me but nice to have. * Dust removal/pixel mapping: good additions but haven't used yet. * RAW+JPEG: takes a lot of memory and is slow but I have mine set to  record both for now. The JPEG resolution can be set to low for quick emails/copies.As far as the drawbacks, the live-view and video mode were convenient but I've gotten used to the view-finder and also bought a new camcorder, too.For me, the most important part of a dSLR camera system is the lens.

But then, you could still always use a good tripod to fix that.A very nice camera that helps beginning or expert photographers grow into their techniques.", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Simply superb", "Author": "Satishkumarbaratam \"Satish B\"", "ReviewID": "R2USXQ2MVHCF4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is no exceptional about the Nikon or Cannon of the same genre, moreover the pentax offers nice features for the bucks paid.

The image stabiliazation on body is very nice, it does work nice. May be the stabilization on lens would be more accurate. However, for the kind of price paid on lens with image stabilzation on nikon or cannon, I 100% prefer to have the pentax.

Hossain", "ReviewID": "R3OFT6QDS2ET25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In 2008, after seeing the review on cameralabs[...] I really liked the Pentax K200D. The build quality and weatherproofing appealed to me. I was considering the Olympus E-510 along with the K200D and Sony A300 since all these cameras had in body image stabilization. I really liked the dust removal system on the Olympus along with its live view system. But the E-510 had a small viewfinder which I checked out in Circuit City and I didn't enjoy using it. It was very hard to see exactly what I was focusing on through the viewfinder. Also, I checked out the amount of noise dcresource[...] and saw that the Olympus does produce more noise at ISO's higher than 400. At the end of the day, I realized that I can't overcome a small sensor. Also Olympus had only a limited number of lenses available, the pricing of the good ones were pretty expensive. I checked out the build quality of Sony cameras and I found them really appalling. It was made up of cheap plastic and the viewfinder was also pretty small. After considering all these factors, I went with the Pentax platform since the camera offered the best build quality, a good viewfinder, 11 point autofocus, ability to use to AA batteries, and finally the ability to add effects to my pictures right within the camera. Since I am a college student, I did not want to spend a lot of time on Photoshop, hence the ability to process certain RAW and JPEG files right on the camera would have saved me a lot of time.  I got my first K200D in November 2008, I took nearly a thousand pictures within the first 3 weeks. Some of which will be printed in a student calender. I really loved using the camera, I just had to adjust and understand the settings of the camera. Like the review on Cameralabs[...], I had to adjust the exposure by 0.3 to 0.7 EV in most cases to get the correct exposure. It was pretty much predictable and once I tweaked the settings the images came out great. But as the days progressed I started seeing that the autofocus speed declined a bit, it wasn't focusing on the subject as fast it was before. Plus, the camera froze on me once, I had to remove the batteries to make it work again. I felt like returning the camera just to be safe. Another reason for returning was that the price of the K20D was also coming down due to thanksgiving.  After thanksgiving, I got the K20D and I loved using it. It was just the K200D but even better. Everything was faster and nicer, the body, the viewfinder, the grip. The ability to change the metering along with the autofocus without accessing the menu was very convenient. But the sample that I received from Amazon suffered from the banding at high ISO's. Also the camera underexposed a bit more than the K200D. Hence sadly I returned the K20D because I didn't want to be stuck with a defective item after spending so much money.  Last January, I decided to go for the K200D again. My reasoning was that the K20D is an amazing camera, but it has some flaws which needs to be ironed out. Hopefully the K30D will have everything in order. It will provide me with a good upgrade path in the future. I decided to save the money from the price difference between the K200D and K20D and use it to buy a good lens. I decided to buy the Tamron 28-75 SP..... and thanfully, I got a good example. The kit lens with the K200D and K20D is a very good one, in terms of build quality especially. On the K200D, the kit lens works very well since it was designed to accomodate the 14.6 MPs produced by the K20D. Hence the 10MP of the K200D falls well within the capabilities of the kit lens.  But this time around, I noticed something different with the K200D. The camera does not underexpose, in fact the exposure is pretty much spot on. In some cases it actually overexposes, but I think it spot on for taking pictures of family and friends. I can pics of my nieces with the curtains drawn and there is minimal light on them, but the camera let enough light in and the picture seemed like it was taken with the curtains open! This is really convenient since now I don't have to fiddle around the exposure level to attain the perfect exposure. I think Pentax has adjusted the exposure levels with the release of the K2000 and made it more user friendly. I urge anybody interested in buying this camera not to be discouraged by the underexposure issue since it is pretty much a non-issue now.  One thing to consider is the limited buffer during continuous shooting, I don't mind the slow speed. But I really find it frustrating that I have to stop every 4th/5th frame. It takes my chances of catching candid moments with friends or family.
