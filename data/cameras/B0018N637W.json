The printer will go anywhere and print right from the camera no PC needed. My wife took a trip right after Christmas and took  her set with her. She was printing and taking pictures of the family and of the kids for the family to have the whole time. It is exceptionally user friendly, there is even some basic editing options built into the camera. If your looking for a Very Good Quality camera printer set , you cannot go wrong with this one for the money. 5 Megapixels isn't as high as most cameras out there but it makes incredibly detailed 3x5 or 4x6 photos", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect for vacation, scrapbooking, and home!", "Author": "Nester \"Corinne\"", "ReviewID": "R3C2JTNQAH3BAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this is a gift and have used it so much more than I even expected!
