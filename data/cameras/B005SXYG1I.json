It has 240 fps, 480 fps, and 1000 fps.  I am sort of a clutz with this stuff, but I can use the 240 fps and 480 fps settings to analyze swings.  There are special settings just for golf with lines for spine angle, etc.  If you really want to improve your game, you must see your golf swing.  The viewing screen is small, but you can plug the camera into a computer for a great viewing.  It is worth the money if you really want to improve your game.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005SXYG1I"}}
