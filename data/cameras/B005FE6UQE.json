{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Please read if considering this camera seriously.", "Author": "Eddie J", "ReviewID": "RFOVIRV8QVEF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The description for this camera says that the 5V power supply is not included. The \"whats included\" states that it is.There was no power supply included with my shipment.I have done several security system installs and was surprised to find that the voltage for the camera was 5V when the cameras normally require 12V for a system. This one does too. I tried a 5V regulated power supply and the power LED came on but all I got was a grey box for the picture. I was sending it back until I read that one person that purchased the camera was shipped a 12V supply. I then hooked it up to a 12V supply and it worked perfectly.The picture quality is surprising for a camera with such a small lens. The images get a little blurry the farther you get from the camera but it isn't a big concern as you can still make out details. By details, I mean I can read 1 inch bold print from 10 feet at least. You can turn the lens bezel to focus the camera to adjust it better for your preferred distance but overall it stays in focus the full range of the room that I have it in.The microphone works very well. When hooked to a computer I had to completely disable the microphone boost to eliminate the feedback and set the record volume to 50 percent. It can pick up very faint sounds even with this setting.The little case that the electronics are in gets a little warm for my liking, but not hot. I am going to get some thermal tape and stick a very small heat sink on it as it is mounted inside of a very small enclosure with no air flow. I don't think its necessary to do this but I will feel better about it where I have it installed.I'm glad I did more research and found that it uses the 12V standard for security systems. I didn't want to send it back and now it works perfectly.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Caught a thief in less than 24 hours after installation", "Author": "I heart Ireland", "ReviewID": "R227WBZW9IGN2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although a bit awkward to install, this camera is a dream for hidden video capture.

The problem I am having with the camera I received is that it stops working after about 24-48 hours. In order for it to start working again it has to be unplugged from the power supply and plugged again. This is unacceptable since the dvr is hard to get to, and to make matters worst is in another country. I will be returning it.Update #1 Seller has been extremely fast in replying and has offered to send me another unit. I have changed the rating based on the seller standing by their product. I will update again once I receive it.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for a covert operation", "Author": "Scott S, Bell \"Entreprenuer\"", "ReviewID": "R28FC811BWCQ4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I work with sales people and sometimes it helps them to video their presentations. If they see a camera they freak out and do not do as well as when they do not see the camera. This mini camer is small enough for it to be hidden in quite a few sports or if you are crafty enough you can drill out a small hole. Once they see the video they are surprised they couldnt see the camera or know where it was.The camera does give a fairly good picure - 420 tvl isnt always the best for details. You do have to use a power supply in order to make this camera work. The square housing where the wires connect in the center does get warm with use. The mic picks up ok but you will want to make sure it is pointed in the direction of the video.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very pleased!", "Author": "Bob M.", "ReviewID": "R214VVR0MYQASR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This small camera produced very good pictures and works great in my application.
