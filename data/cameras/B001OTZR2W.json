{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Eh... some good, some bad... a bit disappointed.", "Author": "J. A. Edwards", "ReviewID": "RLWM5CZ3T13AW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had my EX-FS10 for a couple of weeks now and feel qualified to make an initial review of it.The overall feature set is very impressive, considering its size and shape.  The actual implementation of some features is a bit off though.PRO's:* Very small -- smaller than I expected, and I was expecting small.  I like to carry a camera with me 24/7 and insist on one that takes full motion video, etc.  The small size, HD video features, and rapid shoot features of the FS10 make it perfect for me.* The slow-motion features are VERY cool.  I have been having a lot of fun, often with my young niece & nephew, videoing all kinds of simple things and watching their slo-mo details in playback.  Granted, you lose resolution the slower you go but considering this feature isn't available at all in most (any?) other pocket cameras, I'm willing to accept this.CON's:* Images captured under even moderately low light conditions are very grainy and noisy.  This is looking to be a big problem!  You've got 9MP but when you look at them even a little bit closely you'll see a LOT of multi-color sensor noise/grain.  Using the flash helps but I don't always want to use the flash.  My MUCH older and cheaper digital cameras seem to do better in these same dark conditions!  Perhaps I need to explore the custom settings some more BUT, per my next note, all of your custom settings seem to revert back to defaults every time you turn the camera off.* The camera forgets all(?) of your custom settings when it is turned off and returns to default settings when turned back on.  I think most of the problems I am reporting here could be minimized by tuning the camera's settings to my particular likings and personal shooting styles.  But having to customize my settings, and remembering to even DO this, every time I turn the camera on is a MAJOR hassle.  Example: I prefer to disable the flash/auto-flash and manage lighting myself, but every time I turn the camera back on, the flash will go off if the lighting conditions are even slightly darkish unless I remember to explicitly disable the flash again (and again and again).* Auto-focus for video is sloppy.  It goes in and out of focus even when videoing environments which are pretty much totally \"at infinity\".  I have resorted to always manually focusing to infinity if my subject is more than about 4' away;  perhaps I need to try some of the other auto-focusing schemes -- unfortunately the fact that the camera forgets custom settings every time it is turned off makes the use of other focusing schemes or using fixed focus very inconvenient.* Battery charging requires the battery to be removed and inserted into a separate charger.  My other, older/simpler/cheaper cameras generally let me charge via the USB port -- I would often simply leave these old cameras plugged in after downloading images to \"top off\" the battery.  Having to pop the battery out is a total hassle!  Also, the hardware associated with this battery access seems a bit flimsy to me...* The cover over the USB port is poorly implemented.  Rather than popping out the SD card, I prefer to download pix/vid from the camera via the USB port.  Note first of all that the camera's jack is NOT the standard small USB port that you usually (always?) see -- it is a slightly smaller version that I'd never seen before.  I don't know if it is custom to the Casio brand or what -- I hope not.  The plastic cover over the camera's USB port is on a thin plastic leash but this leash is SOOO short that it is EXTREMELY difficult to hold the cover out of the way and get the USB cable plugged in.  It is such a struggle to plug in the cable that I suspect/fear that it won't be long before the little plastic leash for the USB port cover breaks.Over all I have mixed feelings about this camera.  This is my first Casio camera.  So far I am less than thrilled with some problems I've discovered.  Under OPTIMAL conditions, the automated settings seem to work well and produce great pictures and HD video.  If you deviate from OPTIMAL conditions at all, the automated settings produce mediocre results at best;  and any custom settings are consistently forgotten between power-up's.I'm HOPING that I'll either learn/discover some methods on this new camera to address my problems OR that a firmware upgrade will be released that fixes them.  Fingers crossed.***UPDATE*** Nov. 15, 2010 -- The 4-digit part of the image name on my Casio Exilim camera has rolled over. I have apparently taken over 10,000 pix/vid's on it over the last 1 year, 8 months. That works out to an AVERAGE of 16+ pictures/videos EACH AND EVERY DAY.  Unfortunately, despite all the constant use, I have decided that I really dislike this camera -- it simply has too many ergonomic, design, and workflow problems.  My frugality compels me to keep it until I wear it out; it has taken a beating (including being dropped) during my ownership and it still works just fine -- I have to give it props for being sturdy.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Impressive new features, takes a while to figure out", "Author": "Jan Twardowski", "ReviewID": "R17Z8G2CUB8S67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "David Pogue, the NY Times tech reviewer, effused about Casio's new cameras, so I tried out the smaller version. The main attractions for me were the slo-mo movies and high-speed \"still\" shooting. Both were tough to figure out initially because the printed manual covers little more than turning the camera on, and the CD manual is large and opaque and gives little indication where those key features are to be found.Finally figuring out most of it, I am particularly fond of Slow Motion View, which is great when you're waiting for your granddaughter to kick the soccer goal, the hummingbird to feed on your flowers, or the salmon to jump up the waterfall. You know, the kind of shot you always miss because the camera shutter was too slow. With this Casio, you just hold the shutter button halfway down and the camera will start recording in a buffer up to three seconds of 10 to 30 frames-per second photos at 6 megapixels (NOT the camera's full 9). The buffer doesn't fill up your SD card, but stays in the camera memory until you push the shutter button all the way down. At that point, you've captured up to 30 still pics of what just happened in the last few seconds. Later on (or immediately, if you want), you can pick out the best one or two freeze-frame shots of that rare event.Haven't tried the High Speed Night Scene function or the Multi-Motion Image Procedure, but I like the idea behind each of them. The Night Scene takes a fast series of stills of a night scene, any one of which might be underexposed, and then combines them to give a single shot with vivid colors and lighting. Multi-Motion takes a series of shots of a moving object -- like a skier getting air -- and places several images of that object against a stationary background.I like the camera and will continue to explore its many features, especially for taking pics of my fast-moving granddaughters.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "A fun toy, but not good for every day use", "Author": "Offsky", "ReviewID": "R3K651RBT4GNZZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had been very happy with my previous Casio Exilim camera, so I thought that I would love this upgrade.  Unfortunately, Casio has taken a few steps backwards with this camera.  I would not recommend it.1) The battery life is horrible.  I haven't counted the number of photos or videos per charge, but it is very low.  I took this camera to the Zoo and the battery was dead by the afternoon after maybe a 40 photos and a few short videos.  My previous Casio camera would last for several days between charges.2) To charge the battery, you must remove it from the camera and put it into a separate charger.  Removing the battery is a little tricky for people with big fingers.  My previous Casio could charge the battery without removing it.3) The high-speed video is a neat gimmick, but it isn't practical in real life for two reasons.  First, the resolution is drastically reduced.  At the highest speed, the video is a very thin sliver that is so small, you can almost not see what is going on. Second, the high speed video is very grainy and requires a ton of light.  There is no way that you can get a usable high-speed video indoors. It's just too dark.", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice features, but overall just average", "Author": "C. Tipton", "ReviewID": "RRIL8I90D2BNM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you are thinking about buying this camera, it's probably because of one major thing: the high speed burst/movie mode (an extremely cool feature that, at this time, isn't found on many cameras... and this one is definitely the smallest and most portable right now).This functionality branches off into 3 very unique modes:1) a fast 30 frame per second high speed burst shot that lets you keep all, some, or none of the shots you take while holding down the shutter button.2) a slow motion button that literally slows down the image of your target on the LCD screen and allows you to snap the exact moment you want.3) a high speed movie mode that lets you capture up to 1000 frames per second for super-slow motion movies.These functions sold me, and were the main reason I wanted the camera. I have to say that they are slightly disappointing after working with them for a little over a month. All of the slow motion modes are completely unusable under even the slightest of low light conditions. Because of this, I can't use any of these modes indoors at all. Anything shot without the flash comes out as a dark, grainy mess. With regards to the high speed movies, this should really have been labeled as a 210 fps or maybe 420 fps movie mode, because 1000 fps is completely unwatchable. It shoots at an extremely low resolution and requires an immense amount of light to even show up.Image quality for normal shots is slightly below average. Photos usually come out as very grainy and again require a lot of light. Flash photos come out decent. I seem to have much better luck from other cameras I've owned from Canon and Sony for any kind of indoor photography. The one area the ex-fs10 does seem to work well with is some still low-light photographs. A feature called high speed nightscene uses a method of taking several highspeed photographs at once and melding them into one photo to produce a better photo than you would get under normal circumstances. This prevents a lot of the blur you normally get when using higher ISO's during low light conditions. The same principle is also used in an anti-shake best shot mode, which works reasonably well.The high definition (720p) movie mode is a nice feature, but also tends to come out grainy in low-light conditions, and again is virtually unusable indoors. It has extreme difficulty staying focused and often tends to go in and out of focus.As for size and quality of build: The camera is extremely small and light, and will easily fit in medium-sized pockets. It also has a very sturdy and nice feel to it.Overall, I still think the only reason to buy this camera is if you are extremely interested in the slow-motion modes. They are great if you want to capture fast paced action under high-light conditions (outdoors); however, they severely suffer under low-light conditions. If you are worried about image quality, I'd probably look elsewhere though.", "Date": "July 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "camera guy", "ReviewID": "R3QPFD22XZMWL4", "Overall": "4.0",

price, you can't say no.however, you can only record for about 10 seconds (of real time recording, that's about a minute of slo motion) before it starts to lower the frame rate. also the 1000 fps and 420 fps have a bad quality, not so bad on 420, but pretty bad. make sure you film high speed with a lot of light too, natural light works better than artificial. the HD setting has a low frame

But I was amazed at thegreat quality of the HD 720p video that this takes, and the decent still pictures.The slow motion features are really fun, but they do need plenty of light to make the qualityof the movie decent.Another nice feature is the ability to 'put reality in slow motion'.It records a stream of full size images, and shows them to you in slow motion,(adjustable),as they are cycling, you can choose one to save. (In another mode you can save the whole lot.)It has many more special modes and features which are described on the manual in a pdf fileon the included CD.In low light, the slo-mo is virtually unusable.I would recommend this as a fun video camera, not as a still image camera with some bonus features.The slo-mo stuff works great, the only down side is that the faster you go, the smaller the resolution of the movie. At 1000fps you have a narrow band of a movie.For most things the 210 fps at 480x360 resolution is perfect.The 420 fps records at 224 x 168 and the 1000fps 224 x 64.In conclusion, its a fantastic toy at a great price.If you like playing with blocks, water, nerf guns, etc. this will make it 10x more fun!", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Casio EX-FS10", "Author": "Luke S", "ReviewID": "R1DBNU4UXG5617", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a freaking awesome camera for the price. I am 14 and I bought it because it was a great deal, I needed a camera, and I was interested in high speed videos. If you want to see some videos shot with it, visit my YouTube channels Techwizzy and SL0WitD0WN (the 0's are zeros). There is so much to say about it but I will just do pros and cons.Pros:Small! Definitely fits in any pocket.High Definition 720p video is very clear and I love using it when I'm not using High Speed (HS)HS video is good quality for a cheap camera. 210 fps is good for sports, 420 fps is good for analizing stuff that doesnt require 1000 fps, and the big 1000 fps is so impractical because the resolution is bad and there is a narrow window of recording. However, it makes some sick videos if you get creative with it. Awesome. Stuff like water balloons and high speed impacts. The 30 fps (regular speed) to 210 fps is epic and makes anything look cool. Especially things in motion like vehicles and running things.Picture modes are really fun to mess around with. They take interesting photos. There are also specialized video modes like the camera can begin recording when something comes into view, which is cool.3x zoom is better than you might think and it also has digital zoom for additional range (sacrificing res. , however)Easy to switch between HS and HD with the switch on the side.Cons:The battery life isn't that great. I'm sure you can buy a better battery though. Either that or buy one of those 5 dolalr replacements that Amazon has.Video quality gets worse as frame rate increases.You cannot switch to high speed in the 30-210 mode until you have been recording for like 2 seconds so sometimes you can miss the shot (can get really annoying especially if you missed a really cool shot)Lens cover is crap, mine broke just from a grain of sand getting stuck in it so I forced it open for good, since I didn't want to send it in for a repair.Weak body material. Mine got dents in the front and I don't bump it around that much.HS video sucks in low light conditions or inside. The only light you can actually use for good videos is sunlight and there has to be a good amount. Not like so bright you cant open your eyes, but it has to be there, if you know what I mean.HD video is also bad in low light which is bad for me because I make movies and that means I can only make day movies. You can see some movies on my YouTube channel Sl0WitD0WN (once again, 0's are ZEROs)Overall I am very satisfied with it, and thrilled that I only had to pay 65 dollars. 100 bucks for a great camera like this, I mean you cant beat it. I threw in a couple gift cards and BAM 65 bucks for this baby. I love it. Definitely recommend it if you are into videos more than photography (get a DLSR if you want really good pictures- dont expect them from this, although it can churn out some cool pics). 4/5 stars though because of the cons. I still love it and am very happy to have one. I'm sure there are some things I left out but if you have any questions you can comment on my review and I will get back to you ASAP and answer to the best of my ability! Oh and buy this camera :) Bye!", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "New features overcome drawbacks", "Author": "Robert T. Rumer", "ReviewID": "R8XGJGVBHLPO2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I teach college physics/engineering and heard about Casio's high speed capabilities at a conference.  I was interested in seeing how well the high speed video features worked since I had always wanted to try this out.  In a word:  UNBELIEVABLE!!  I can take all sorts of videos and pictures I had only dreamed of taking before.I was very busy so I gave the camera to a student who had no photographic experience and let her play with it.  Within minutes she was excitedly running in to show me what she had captured.  Over the next few weeks, she explored a wide range of high speed videos which was quite exciting.Great high speed videos at 210 fps but, to be honest, the 420 and 1000 fps are pretty disappointing. On the otherhand, the 210 seems to work well for an awful lot of situations.  Slinkies falling down stairs, bowling balls colliding with pins, sprays of water colliding.  This camera turns ordinary people into nature photographers/videographers.Multi-image pictures take lots of trial and error but when you get a good one, what a thrill.  \"Burst Mode\" and \"Best Shot\" modes make impossible shots easy.That being said, the camera has serious flaws which have been mentioned in the other reviews:- Attrocious battery life.  No power connection other than USB.- Charging only by removing the battery.- Flimsy USB connections.- Poor quality videos at normal light levels.  The faster you go, the more light you need.  This may not be a flaw of the camera but an issue with high speed videos.All-in-All:  This camera gives you features never before accessible by normal folk which allow them to dabble at things they only dreamed about at a ridiculous cost.  Great for catching quick action sports/performances and for high speed videos.  This won't be the one camera you buy which you use for everything.  This will be the camera you buy which you play with and have a blast in specific situations.  UNBELIEVABLE!", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not a bad camera depending on what you are looking for", "Author": "Stan C.", "ReviewID": "RQCL7MIOJ6ZCR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: nice features, lightweight, compact, minimal shutter lagCons: battery life, noisy at low lightFirst, if you take a lot of photos during the evening, or in low-light situations, stop reading and look for another camera. The biggest issue with this camera is that it tends to be a little \"noisy\" at ISO400 and higher, even when using the flash. To be honest, you're better off getting one of the Canon Powershots or investing in a baseline DSLR. As always, when buying any camera, figure out what you want to use it for before looking.PhotosDuring the daytime however, the camera takes some pretty nice shots. The nice thing about it is that the auto function combined with Casio's \"Best Shot\" menu make it easier to set for different situations. The best ISO setting would probably be between the 100-200 range. The optional 30 fps high speed setting is pretty impressive for a point and shoot. This is great for sporting events, or trying to nail a shot of the little one chasing the dog. The auto white balance is a little off at times, but there's also an option to adjust it manually, so not that big of a deal. The camera uses digital zoom, which isn't that great. Even in daylight, it's difficult to get a clean shot zoomed in.VideosFirst, the slow motion option for videos is AMAZING. Being the only consumer camera with this option it's a really fun feature to play with. However, it suffers from the same type of noise in poor light, even if you are in a room with the curtains drawn. In order to take a nice clean video using a framerate of 210 fps or higher, you'll need to be outdoors in bright sunlight. The same applies to 30fps, although the noise isn't as bad. The resolution becomes lower as you increase the fps. the 30-210 and 210 fps settings seem to be the best. While 1000 fps is really nice, the quality is a bit poor, and the files tend to be huge. If you're planning to do a lot of slow motion video, you'll want to get a memory card that is decent size (at least 4GB). 3 minutes of vid shot at 210fps is roughly 300-400 MB in size. The camera will also shoot HD vids at 720p, but it's not that spectacular. There have been comments about the camera not auto-focusing during video. This isn't entirely true. You'll need to turn continuous AF on before you start as well as set the type of auto focus you want (spot, tracking, etc). By default, the continual AF option is turned off. What you cannot really do is AF after the camera zooms in, so there is a limit.Battery LifeBattery life it terrible. Another reviewer mentioned that it only lasts 2.5 hours, and he's pretty much right. That time is cut even shorter when filmining videos. Note that the battery has a capacity of 750 mAh, which is not much. In comparison, the Nikon battery for the D90 is 1500 maH and lasts much longer. So if you're planning a long trip, you might want to bring a spare.Overall, I'm very happy with the camera. I didn't buy it for taking pictures, but more for using the slow motion feature, and it's slim, compact design. Again, if you're looking to replace your point and shoot, I suggest looking at Canon or Nikon as they are much more versatile.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Casio Exilim EX-FS10 9MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image...", "Author": "TRAVIS T \"WOODGRAIN\"", "ReviewID": "R2M2SUU0HB5ORC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SUPER!!!SUPER!!!

Seems like I paid just over $100 or so.Only downers are battery life and low light situations. You really need lots of light to use slow-mo and high-speed shooting. Forget about 1000/fps, not worth a hoot. Shooting @ 210/fps is very acceptable and you will have a blast with this camera.Get a couple extra batteries (I have 5 total) and a wall charger as you will need them. I ran through one full battery just playing around and getting used to some of the features. It really eats up batteries in the video modes, so be warned and stock up on batteries.Shop ebay for some really good deals for chargers and batteries and you're good to go. Oh, one more thing, get at least a 16g SDHC card class 6 or higher.

Fits in any pocket and with the lens slightly receded in the case, you dont have to worry about it getting too scratched up.Id buy another one if This one ever broke, But its as tough as nails, so im not worried about that.the programs settings are great to, Offering tons of control, like focus pan and best shot memory set banks, or just let it take over in auto shot modeThe battery is pretty weak though,  Not sure whats up with that, Only lasts for about 100 picsOn the plus side of that, you can get a back up battery for about 5 bucks if you look around.The fs 10 is the smaller version of the higher quality casio fs 100,  i think the fs 100 run about 600 bucks..

I use it almost exclusively for taking slow motion videos of my golf swing, at for that there is no alternative. Casio is the only manufacturer that makes affordable slow motion digital cameras, and this is their least expensive. I divide it's functionality into three categories:1) Slow motion video2) High definition video3) Pictures1-As I said, I use it almost exclusively for number 1. In this category, it's the best around. It's not great in low-light, but for my uses it works. I'll keep the money that I would need to upgrade to a pricier Casio rather than buy one that's better in low light situations. The editing feature is great so that I don't have to do that on my computer and waster time transferring large files. I really can't say enough about how great this function is at this price point.2-Haven't used it much, but from what I can tell it's works just fine as you would expect it to.3-Also haven't used much, but it's very portable, which is a plus.
