{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very bad camera not to mention the bad experience with customer service", "Author": "Erika", "ReviewID": "R32TCZ52SD7ZQ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a gift. The first time my brother used it water leaked in several places in the camera so we either got a defective product, or the product itself does do what it's supposed to. He gave it back to me to return it. First I filed a claim with amazon and they said to contact manufacturer since it was still under warranty. Given it's a Coleman product, I called Coleman ad when I as finally able to go through, they said it was not their product but it was actually manufactured by some else licencing their name. I have tried calling the other company several times and haven't been able to talk to anyone there. At this point, I just feel frustrated of this bad experience with everyone involved. Can someone please help me here? I want my money back so I just need to know where can I ship the defective product to and how's the process to get my refund of the cost + shipping charges.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great gift for kids /teens", "Author": "Marika W.", "ReviewID": "R2NOHVJ6PUM8D1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought one for both daughters.
