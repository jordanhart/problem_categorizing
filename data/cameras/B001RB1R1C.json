Recieved the camera in a timely fashion, but it kept acting up. It would quit working and show low battery with new batteries, along with lights going on at the wrong time and generally odd behavior. The obvious thing to do was to ship it back for a trade in, but I'm as broke as it gets right now and couldn't afford return shipping. So, having limited choices I chose to open it up, voiding any return claim. since the front lens parts seem to be glued on, it wouldn't open all the way, but would pry apart enough to see the problem. The positive lead from the battery box had been pinched in between the case and the metal memory card cover during assembly, and was apparently grounding out on it. Long story short, moved the lead, put it back together, works fine. So I have a camera and a small adventure.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Video Recording, Digital Still and PC Camera\n3.1 Megapixel\nBuilt-in flash\n4X Digital Zoom\nJPEG, AVI File Formats", "Name": "Jazz DVK141 3.1MP Digital Video Camera (Red)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bycp0uinL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001RB1R1C"}}
