{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "J. L. \"J. L.\"", "ReviewID": "RP0LXISN9BDZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used a few different DVRs.  The others have said that they you can access them on smart phones, but it has always been just a live feed and through a web browser.  This one offers an app for every platform.  I have only used the iphone/ipad app.  The app is DYNAMITE!  It works fast with playback and no glitches - even over the Internet.  It was so well put together.Regarding the purchaser, you need to be careful where you buy them from.  I called for tech support and they said that since I did not buy it from an authorized dealer, they will not support me.  It does not state on their website that you must buy from an authorized dealer to be eligible for support, but the website does promise technical support.  Setup was easy and I only called for help with an advanced function anyway.  I have not fought the company over this and I am just using the DVR without any advanced functions because of this.Even without the tech support and advanced functions, it is the best DVR that I have used and I have used a few DVRs both hardware and software based in the past.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$369.95", "Features": null, "Name": "DIGIMERGE DH204501 4 Ch H.264 DVR with USB, IR remote, 120 FPS 500GB HDD, CMS s", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31f4rjWXMjL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0044ZUNVI"}}
