Winker", "ReviewID": "R2VT11TSAAT9HH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I shoot a lot of motorsports, so I need a camera that has a long lens and quick reaction. I bought the S2700HD at Best Buy for under $200 on a Fathers Day special. The 18X zoom and use of AA batteries were good selling points for me. Unfortunately, I have not been terribly happy with the action shots. It takes a bit of manual manipulation to set the camera for good action photos.It does work well for family photos and I was quite pleased with the photos I took at the Evergreen Aviation Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, home of the Spruce Goose.The biggest problem with action shots is the automatic focus. It is necessary to pre-focus, but even then the resulting photo may turn out wa-a-ay out of focus.The focus is also a serious problem when shooting video. Auto-focus keeps trying to re-focus in the middle of shooting, so the result is pretty much unusable.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "good bargain", "Author": "poopsey", "ReviewID": "R2QXJYN2SJ39XX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good value for the price; I love it. the product is as described and takes beautiful photos.

I am surprised that they do not get more consideration.", "Author": "Peter Braun \"book neophyte\"", "ReviewID": "R2WCZE4LCVBSB7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "took out my Fuji Superzoom 2700HD today.  It took amazingly crips photos outside on  a sunny day.  They look sharp and detailed.  Indoors, the pictures were dark and poor, but I did not use flash.  The extreme zoom is excellent.What I do not like is not having a separate door for the flash memory card.  It is mixed in with the battery door.  They should separate these.In addition,  the LCD screen seems to be of an extremely low resolution.  The images on screen are poor.  It is a large screen, but super low res.Best thing about the camera is it is the perfect size.  The ergonomics, handhold and weight are perfect.  Would be great for hiking and taking on vacation.The 28 mm to about 504 mm lens is about all you would ever need.  Going longer than 504 would require a tripod for sure.I am surprised by how a good a camera the Fuji is for such a low price.  I would buy it again.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "FujiFilm FinePix S2700", "Author": "lilkato", "ReviewID": "R31GO4RIGF1PSM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was given this camera as a gift about 2 years ago, so I have some experience with it. It has mostly been used to take still shots, and so I can't speak about action shooting too extensively. It is a great camera for it's price, but that's not to say improvement couldn't be done. With that being said, here's what I've found so far.Pros:- The 12.2MP offers really nice quality images for a point and shoot. I've had many pictures developed at Walmart and about 95% of the time they turn out awesome as a 4x6. I've also had larger prints done and they turned out great!- The 3\" color LCD screen is helpful when taking a picture or when checking out what you've done. I also like that you can switch back and forth between looking at the LCD screen or using the small lense thing (I have no idea what it's called.)- It takes 4 AA batteries to function. I bought rechargable Energizer and haven't had any issues. Lasts through 5-600 pictures for me (estimate)- The zoom is a nice feature and works to an extent..(See below)- I have played around with video recording and I really like the quality of the video as long as you have good lighting. For me, it has worked best when the sun is out, or inside near a bright window. In low light, it doesn't function as well.- The red eye removal on this works like a charm! I've taken thousands of pictures and have yet to see one with red eye. My mother has bright blue eyes and they come out lovely with this camera.-Panorama effect is a neat little feature. I have played around with it a few times. It takes some practice to line things up the way they need to be, but once you learn how to do it you can capture some really fun images.-Fairly easy to learn the ways of this camera. I didn't look at the manual much when I got this camera (and still don't to this day) and I have learned the features and functions fairly well. I would rate is 9/10 in Ease of Use. _I have taken care of this camera since I recieved it, and 2 years later it's still going strong, so I would say it's a durable and sturdy device.Could be Improved:- I loathe the flash on this thing. Especially in low light. It is blinding and very noticable. It is one of the main reasons I rated it as a four star camera.-In low light, image quality definitely declines even with a flash. I don't like this because many pictures I take are in a building with not the best lighting. There's a lot of noise.- Autofocus is...pretty aweful. It takes a long time to get to the focus you want, especially when you have zoomed in. At the highest zoom capability, pictures are \"ok\" but nothing close to \"good.\"- Face detection really isn't all that helpful. Pictures taken with it off compared to with it on are basically the same. If a camera has a feature, I would like that feature to work properly. It also occassionally says \"blink detected\" when no one in the photo blinked.-Actions shots don't come out well. Often times they are blurry and unusable. If you want this camera to capture your kids in action, you won't be satisfied with it.Overall for the price it is a nice camera for a beginner that can take some pretty awesome photos in the right setting. I'm sure there are better point and shoots out there, but I wouldn't rule this one out completely. I plan to upgrade to a DSLR soon to get into photography further, but this one has definitely been a good starting point for me as I'm learning. So, if you are a beginner just looking for something affordable to take family photos, shots of your kids/animals/scenery that turn out decent, don't rule this camera out. If you are wanting something more advanced...I'd suggest you keep looking.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$560.01", "Features": "12.2-megapixel, 1/2.3\" CCD\nFujinon 18x & Wide 28mm Zoom Lens\nLarge 3.0-inch LCD Monito\nHigh Sensitivity + CCD Shift Image Stabilization\nHigh Sensitivity (max.
