{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best little camera for the money...", "Author": "Donald Tew", "ReviewID": "R1WV2I0OMMUOEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought this little camera new, it lasted over a year before it got crushed in my pocket while working outside. So I bought the same camera as it was refurbished, again that one was also crushed in the same pocket. Now, I won't buy another camera but this one as I'm very satified with how my pictures turn out. They are clear, don't take up much space on my laptop and I don't have to wait for the lens to pop out before I can take a picture. Just turn it on, point and shoot and walla, you've got an in focus picture of whatever it is you were wanting to save as a picture. Even the zoom feature on this camera comes out clear.This would make a good camera for a beginner as it's very easy to use and has enough features in it to make it an exciting little camera for the novice kind of photographer.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "HP Q2180A", "Name": "HP PhotoSmart 320 - Digital camera - compact - 2.1 Mpix - supported memory: MMC, SD - silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21M5XWC5EXL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00006IKDN"}}
