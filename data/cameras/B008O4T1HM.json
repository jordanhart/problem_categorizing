{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great camera.  accessories - not so much.", "Author": "515m", "ReviewID": "RV1J1HKKSSCK4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "a good deal for all you get, however definitely a beginner package. the camera and nikkor lenses are the real deal here.  they are exactly as you'd expect, and have been reviewed thoroughly all over the web.  (5 stars for the camera and lenses).  however the add-ons might keep you going until you really get into using them - then you'll want to upgrade.  the tripod is small and light, but not very solid.  probably good for taking group photos, but nothing w/ a longer exposure.  the wide angle and telephoto lenses are a bit of a novelty.  neat to try out, but also but not very solid.  the telephoto lens came apart the first time i tried to put it on (it screwed back together easily).  the wide angle lens, when shooting with the 18-55mm lens at its widest (18mm) setting, captures the ring frame of the wide angle lens in the photos.  the bag is handy, has two backpack style straps and holds everything nicely.  the downside is that it has a HORRIBLE chemical smell to it that fills the air.  I've had it for a couple of weeks now, and the room that it is sitting in reeks of some sort of petroleum product.  i won't use it.  this is a good package if you want a good camera with two good lenses, but i will probably cycle the accessories out as i quickly replace the ones i'll really end up using.  i've already replaced the tripod with this:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U5U1BE/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1  (love it).  and will probably replace the wide angle lens with a proper one.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Wesapea", "ReviewID": "R2XSEC39OBGK8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome just what I wanted Nikon camera and lenses top-quality accessories of a lower quality but well worth the money.

The camera bag they shipped is a small/cheap bag NOT the one described/displayed in the ad, the tripod is flimsy and would only be used for a point and shoot camera. the exterior flash is a $5 disposable.  In the future I would recommend purchasing only the camera and two lenses and forget the rest of the trinkets.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Charlotte S.", "ReviewID": "RFL6A8MDHX6U4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the bag it came with .... im not sure how the flash works  and the really havent used much or any of the xtras but man is this a great camera!", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "!!!!!!", "Author": "dezerae silva", "ReviewID": "R1AKXCJGY209QV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got my camera quickly!! exactly as described and i love it !! it works great & very cost effective great prices thank you thank you", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Mickle", "ReviewID": "RELEJCUHKBB1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome package!!contained everything needed for beginning photographer.

No lens cap retainers. Lens hood is basically useless.Pros: GREAT camera, backpack fits everything...and although some of the lens attachments are cheap, they produce some pretty cool effects.

I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a Digital SLR camera, do your research and see which ones you like. I looked at both the Canon and Nikon cameras, and they are both really good cameras.  It comes down to your preference for how the set up is and layout, and what options come on the camera. I would say that the Nikon is not as amateur friendly if you are new to a digital SLR camera.
