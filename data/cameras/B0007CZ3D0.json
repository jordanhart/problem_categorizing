The pre-set dial on the back makes selecting shooting modes much easier, with choices of Auto-shoot, programmed auto-shoot (where you can create your settings)Manual,movie mode (Quick Time movies with sound)self-portrait, landscape/portrait, sport, night scene,and landscape. The viewfinder (an rarity with point and shoot digital cameras these days), is a little small, but does the job. The screen is incredibly sharp and gives you a real sense of how the shot will turn out. It is very nice in the hand, and very stable to use (no more camera shake!) In short, a crisp, clean, sweet camera, and well-recommended.", "Date": "April 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "You CAN change the default settings", "Author": "C. J.

For the price, I was surprised by the manual settings and the optical zoom. Even though I say megapixels don't mean much, it's nice to have the extra pixels of a 5MP. From pressing the power button to having the first shot taken, it is about 5 seconds. In 10 seconds, I can fire 5 shots without the flash on the manual setting. Not to bad for a point and shoot without a continous shooting feature. The 19 shooting modes seem to work pretty well.The video is only 320x240 which isn't anything special. It will take a video until the card is full (no time limit).The camera is very easy to use switching from shooting to viewing mode. The functions work as expected. It is definitely much easier to use than some of the older Olympus cameras. It's easier to use, IMO, than many of the Kodak cameras as well.It uses xD memory cards which aren't very standard. We were able to get a 256MB card for $35 which isn't too bad.As for the person complaining about the USB cable: you'll notice the end of the cable that plugs into the camera has 6 pins, while  USB only has 4 pins. The reason for this is that the A/V cord plugs into the same jack on the camera as the USB, so it must use the other 2 pins for it.All in all, this is a good camera for beginners and anyone wanting a sub-$200 P&S; that takes decent photos.", "Date": "September 12, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the money", "Author": "Alexander", "ReviewID": "R1TYRLF4OBI41C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a backup to my 8MP Olympus C8080.  Many of the pictures I've taken with this camera are indistinguishable from the ones I've taken with my 8MP camera in terms of quality.  It's simply fantastic.  I recomend this camera for anybody who's looking 5MP digital.  As for the reviewer who had missing serial number for the software, forget about the included software.  It is not good anyways.  As for the customer support being outside US, that is the reason why the camera is sold for only $200.  If this camera was to be manufactured in US and had customer support by good old americans, it would be so expensive that most of us would be still stuck with the old kodak film camera.", "Date": "September 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera!! The Best Of Its Price", "Author": "Prasanna \"L.Prasanna Venkateswaran\"", "ReviewID": "R1BXWRIVMQ2Y0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera in its range..This olympus has 320 x 160 Quick Time Movie mode..This is not so exciting.. But others features are simply great...It has in-built help and tons of in-built features and shooting modes. If you are person who likes simplicity and powerfullness, this suits you perfect. The menu operations are very simple and its zooming is really good.The images are crystal clear and sharp..The design is also great.. It is very easy to handle.The thing is you 'll need atleast 128 MB XD Card for experiancing its complete excellence.. The pictures at the Best quality mode are really great..Even a $400 camera dosn't have such an excellent contrast and brightness. Exciting pics.. When I compared with other cameras around $350, this is even better..The 2in 1 mode isa good one.. The Panorama Mode is extremely great.. You can stitch like 8 pics together to any side using the Olympus Master software given with the camera.. You can take a vast landscape as several pics and fix it all together.The only problem I face is it does not have Lithium Ion or some in-built rechargeble battries, it uses 2 AA batteries.. So you need atleast two sets of good rechargeble batteries ( Preferrably Duracell or Panasonic ) and a good quick recharger. This would do really good..If you have the batteries, then its the best camera in its price, I bet it.. Its Simply Excellent", "Date": "November 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Easy to use and amazing photos", "Author": "S.

Also, this model was one of the few digital cameras to still use AA batteries, which is important when you need a cheap and easy to obtain  backup power source. However, for reasons known only to Olympus they decided to change the USB cable to a non-standard plug on the camera end of the cable. When you have to plug into 10-15 different computers in different offices, standardization is important. A camera that can't be used because somebody lost an oddball cable that's only available by special order is worse than useless.
