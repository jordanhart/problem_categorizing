{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Extensive Review By Photography Newbie", "Author": "Alan Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R35XHG7MZPYQCX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is aimed at people who are new to photography, as I am in the same boat.  There are much more thorough reviews on Amazon for people who are already serious photographers.General Impression:Wonderful camera - gives you control of parameters (such as f/stop, ISO, shutter speed) when you want to play with them or get creative and will auto-select them when you just want to take pictures.  This was important to me as I am still learning to adjust them to my liking but don't want to miss out on pictures because I'm fumbling around with buttons.Construction/Feel:After going to Best Buy to physically hold the Canon T3i and Nikon d5100, I immediately decided on the Nikon.  It felt much better in my hands and just looked better in general.  Both were fairly light which is nice but also means they are made from quite a bit of plastic - not a problem though as this keeps the price down and I don't drop things.Controls:I have been pleased with the placement of the physical buttons on the camera as well as the menus.  I mainly shoot in the A, S, and M modes and the little wheel you turn to adjust the shutter speed/aperture is right where your thumb falls.  If you're in M mode, there is an aperture button to hold down just behind the shutter button which is also easy to reach with the camera up to your eye.  Lastly, the Fn button can be programmed to control the ISO level so you can hold it down while spinning the wheel to change that without putting the camera down.  I have heard people complain that the Live View switch is annoying to get to but have found it intuitive.There are a few controls that I wish were changeable without having to dig through a menu though.  For instance, to change the focus mode from area to single point requires you to have the LCD screen turned around, then press the I button, then scroll around to change it.  This is the case for a few other things like metering, shutter mode, etc.  I can't really complain, though, because those are features that go on a serious photographer's camera that costs about twice as much as this model.Auto Focus:The 11-point AF on this camera has been a dream to use.  I almost always keep the camera set to single point servo autofocus so I can select the point I want it to focus to.  As long as you have some contrast, it is very quick and accurate to focus.  This camera does not have a build in focus motor which means the lens must have it built in.  As a result, older lenses or those build for the professional Nikons may not allow for autofocus.  This hasn't been a big issues as most of the lenses I would want already have the motor built in, and if they don't, people survived for a long time manually focusing - it probably builds character.  I was torn between getting the Nikon 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5G ED AF-S DX Nikkor Wide-Angle Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Camerasand Tokina AT-X116PRDXN AT-X PRO DX 11-16mm Ultra-wide Angle Lens for Nikonand ended up sticking with the Tokina even though it would not autofocus on this camera.  I haven't had any issues with focusing manually with it as the ultra-wide angles are easy to focus anyway.Noise:A lot of the reviews I read before purchasing this camera talked about how well it shot in low light - I would have to agree.  Looking at pictures from my old point and shoot at ISO 800 have horrible noise while I can shoot this at 1600 without any, and can go up to 3200 with only minimal touch ups in Lightroom needed.  This has to be the single biggest advantage of digital over film - being able to change ISO on the fly and still being able to get great pictures at ISO 3200 is wonderful.Image Quality:I won't offer too many opinions in this section, but I have not seen anything but great quality in the RAW pictures I've taken.  Basically I understand that if a picture doesn't come out right, the fault lies with me and not the camera.  The camera is capable of much better pictures than I am capable of taking.  When I do everything right (which is becoming a little more frequent) I am amazed of the result.  Great colors, great contrast, low noise, etc.Battery Life:I purchased an extra battery before I went on a few business trips just in case, but ended up never being close to needing it.  The battery just lasts and lasts and never seems to drain.  For instance, last weekend I took 381 shots (some using live view) and the battery meter was still at 75%.  No complaints in this department.Flash:The built in flash is pretty puny, which seems to be par for the course.  It does provide some nice fill lighting if you're outside taking pictures where there are some shadows on your subject, but for shooting inside it's marginal at best.  I bought the very reasonably priced Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and have been very pleased with the combo.  The external flash adds the ability to bounce light off the ceiling and not waste the camera battery while doing so. This camera does not have the Nikon flash commander ability, but I don't think that should be expected in a camera at this price point.  If I ever start buying 3 remote flashes for studio shooting, there is a good chance I will have already upgraded cameras.I'll end by saying that this has been an absolutely wonderful camera to learn to shoot on.  Before I purchased it or started shooting, I ordered and read two books,Complete Digital Photography, 6th EditionThe Digital Photography Book, Volume 1 so I would have some clue what I wanted in a camera.  They are both wonderful books and should be required reading for all new photographers.As a disclaimer: up till 3 months ago I was never in to photography, never owned an SLR and never had any real interest to.  So know that everything I say in this review is based on very little experience.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "What a great deal!!!", "Author": "stargaze", "ReviewID": "RYTZ0688FZ0O7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I checked prices all over and this was absolutely the best deal. This camera is amazing. Everytime I use it I learn something new about it. I love the 300mm lense and the macro is so very cool. The video is amazing quality and so easy to use. I am having a blast with this camera. I am not a professional. I had an old Nikon E4040 35mm that I loved. Then I got a simple digital point and shoot. Now I have this amazing camera. I have lots to learn still but already it was money well spent. Oh be careful with the tripod, it is not heavy duty. I did buy a higher end tripod to better safe guard my camera. The batteries do last a long time and it is great having two. The battery drains faster when shooting video as expected. The size of the SD card is wonderful. My old Nikon lenses did fit the camera and work but the quality is not the same as the new lenses.

I have used a Fuji S3 for about 8 years, which is built on the Nikon Body for professional work, I suspect that I have shot more that 500,000 images during that time and the camera still does a fine job, howbeit when it started showing signs of shutter and mirror drag, I started research for a new replacement camera,  Now being retired I wanted something that gave me ease of use, but also the bells and whistles to do artistic and creative nature photography with dependability and quality image files.  A friend obtained the Nikon 3100, so by reviewing his camera, and testing lens and such, the Nikon D5100 met the requirements and at a price fitting my budget.

The kit itself is pretty decent. The camera bag I received was okay but felt pretty flimsy and cheap compared to my Samsonite DSLR bag. The biggest problem was with the included memory card. My card was a Sony branded one, which according to Nikon's page for the D5100, is not on the tested and approved list. Of course I didn't think to check the card make before some shooting and that turned out to be a problem.I placed the card into the included USB reader and all the pictures showed up. When I went to move them over to the computer, it failed. Then neither the PC or the camera could read the card. Thankfully, demo software I found online was able to recover the photos. That's when I looked online and noticed several complaints against that card in particular and then went to Nikon's site to find tested and approved cards. It'd be great if the vendor threw in a card that was actually approved by Nikon.Overall, the camera is fantastic. It's a much better than the Fujifilm S9000 I was using. I view the kit existing mainly for the extra zoom lens, memory card reader and consumer level tripod. If you get the same bag, you'll want to probably upgrade to a better one. If you get the same SDHC card by Sony, DON'T use it. Google Nikon D5100 memory card and you should see a support page for the camera that lists known good cards.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great!!

The D5100 is outstanding, but it's put me on the steep end of the learning curve for photography again for the first time since I got my Nikon F2 back in '72.  Much to learn to gain partial mastery of it, but it can do amazing things.  I'm particularly impressed with its low-light performance.  Just last night, not a particularly clear night, I aimed it straight up and did a 30 second exposure of the Milky Way (in a nice dark location) and man, it recorded about a million more stars than I could see with my 57 year old eyes.  This is good, because I intend to do lots of overnight time lapses of the sky and the valley below me.  That's what I bought it for.  It's considerably better than I'd expected.  (Though now I wish I'd sprung for the D5200, which is supposed to be even better.

I wasn't willing to buy the D5200 and it's 24 mp sensor, because the difference is only apparent in large prints. In summary, the D5100 has superior image quality and low-noise at high iso (upwards to 1,000 iso) low light situations, a good button layout, and a video mode that leaves the user wanting more.Features at glance:  - 3-inch LCD swivel screen  - 16.2MP (same sensor as D7000)  - In-camera HDR (High Dynamic Range)  - Full HD 1920 x 1080p at 30fps  - ISO Sensitivity: 100-6400 (Extended Mode: 100-25600)PROS+ Stunning image quality - very crisp and sharp+ Easy to navigate through menu+ Good, intuitive button layout. I prefer Nikon's entry level DSLR layout to Canon's, with Nikon's placement of the thumb dial and cursor pad.+ Lightweight+ In camera HDR+ Very good performance at high iso and low light situations+ Reliable and trusty Sigma 70-300mm lens. Not as sharp as Nikon lens, but very very good. Good range and focus rings.CONS+ lack of Nikon branded accessories - no Nikon brand battery grip or LCD cover+ Decent video mode - not fully manual like Canon's entry level Rebel series. The only mode that gives you control is aperture priorityThe D5100 has an excellent sensor in a small form entry level body. If you don't need the extra buttons, LCD screen, weather-sealed body, the D5100 is a great place to start digital photography or as a lightweight backup to pros.Word of caution: as you learn more about digital photography with the D5100, you may find yourself outgrowing the entry level body rather quickly. 6 months later I downgraded the sensor and bought a pro-grade body with the D200. The pro-grade body's rugged build and plethora of buttons are very useful as your skills develop.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "amexico", "ReviewID": "R302Z997LW76JK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife for Christmas last yearShe has spent a good bit of time reading the manual and says she really likes itI thought the price was reasonable for the items receivedShe uses it to take pictures of birds and would like to have a little longer lens", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Jake's Mom \"Michelle\"", "ReviewID": "RSFOV9IP1Y3QU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having fun learning how to use my new camera.

The quality of the lenses are extraordinary and even a professional photographer acquaintance of mine agreed that the ISO level it reaches, the color adjustment and other focus settings are good enough to make pro-level photography.The color balance for the video and the level of sound are very good. Even the night vision and other effect functions are acceptable (while I am still trying all of them, everything works fine). I should point my main purpose is to take stills and not video so I chose this brand for the reviews and recommendations I got for that specific use.Fully recommended purchase.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "So exited!!!!!", "Author": "Kety", "ReviewID": "R2Q1B64QT4MGQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i've always loved cameras.... i've had many digital cams and always wanted a ptofessional digital camera... they were always really expensive and i never really knew which one i would buy when i had the money....well i saved up and did some research and at last decided to buy the Nikon D5100... i'm still learning how to use it well to get all the advantages it has to offer but its been a month and i'm sooo happy with this camera...i've found it very easy to use... i've gotten a couple of lens and well still learning... every time i grab it i'm like : wow i can do that? and i'm so amazed at the quality!!! lol i'm just overall exited!!!if anyone has any pointers for me or suggestios on how to use it or accessories i should get......PLEASE let me know!!!! i would really appreciate it!!!tks", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is the kit", "Author": "FG", "ReviewID": "R13XJICULOWGWO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a nice camera kit for introduction to photography.  Found it!  Just about everything in here in useful and better quality than I was expecting. They originally forgot to ship the bag with the kit so keep your eye out when they send the shipping information showing the items listed.  The SD Card is Sony, the tripod is Bower and has been very useful for indoor use.  Haven't tried it for sporting events but I will soon to see how it holds up outside in the elements.  Also purchased a few filters, macro kit and a Speedlight to wrap up everything I need to get started.
