{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An awesome camera for an even better price!", "Author": "Mary Jo Sminkey \"15 years of Amazon Reviews!\"", "ReviewID": "RWV2SIILAD2D9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd been wanting to go digital with my photography hobby for a few years, and purchased a nice Nikon Coolpix only to find it was fine for casual shots but still not what I need for my action shots and more serious work. But the digital SLRs were too new, too expensive, and have too few of the feature I felt they needed for the price. When the Canon 10D came out, and I started reading the great reviews on it, I finally knew the time had come! After a few months of using it, I can report that I am totally happy I made the switch! First, even though Canon made lots of improvements over the D60, they lowered the price considerably. This camera has pretty much everything I need. The one big negative for most people, the fact that your focal lengths are multiplied by 1.6 is actually a bonus for me since I shoot almost exclusively with telephoto. If you do ultra-wideangle stuff, this is certainly a problem. Being able to switch the ISO setting is great. Sure, I could always swap my film mid-roll if I had to, but always had to waste a few frames, and it was always a pain to do. Not a problem now, just a simple camera setting. I shot some indoor stuff at both 1600 and 3200, the 3200 was not real useable, but the 1600 was pretty decent, particularly after some clean-up in Photoshop. That's of course the biggest advantage I find with digital. There's so much that I can do in Photoshop that I couldn't easily do with film. There's some excellent books out there on using Photoshop for digital photographers, and there are some great actions and filters that will help automate your corrections. I sell all my photos online through a website that handles all the printing and shipping for me as well, and does a great job with all my shots. I love being able to immediately see the shot that I took. I don't always have time between shots, but I can often review them later, and delete directly from the camera any obviously bad ones, and show off some of the great ones! It's a great learning tool and my skills have already started to improve as a result. Another great feature with digital is the EXIF information that gets embedded in the digital files. No need to record your shooting parameters, just open the file up in Photoshop (or other program that supports it) and you have all the information on your shot: date and time taken, fstop used, maximum fstop, shutter speed, exposure and white balance settings, focal length, etc. Really great particularly if you are just learning. The camera functions and menus are pretty easy to use and fairly intuitive, particularly if you are used to Canons as I was. The quality of your photos will be greatly improved with good lenses, don't spend this much for a camera and then get cheap lenses! Good glass is really essential. I would also strongly suggest that you get a USB 2.0 or Firewire compact flash reader for your computer rather than trying to download directly from the camera using the rather slow USB 1.1. If you shoot lots of photos this is practically essential, I can easily fill a couple of 1 gig cards in a session.  Most of the gripes I have with the camera are fairly minor. I would like more than 6MP, more autofocus sensors, larger buffer (to handle more than 9 shots at a time), more frames a second, etc. But for the price, I don't think you will find a better digital camera,", "Date": "June 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "wonderful", "Author": "robert", "ReviewID": "R2USBVPNKNAYFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been very resistant to digital cameras. I mainly use a elan 7 and a mamiya 645 for all of my work, but after spending hours and hours every night scanning prints and slides, and even more time removing those little specs from dust, I took the plunge into the world of dslr cameras. I chose the 10d because the rebel's body is a little cheap and the 1ds is way out of my price range. The 10d is a very sturdy camera with a good amount of weight to it that helps reduce camera shake. The focusing problems other peaple have talked about is not present in my camera. I have several friends with 10ds and they have no proplems either. I think that people might not be paying attention to shutter time ar perhaps they are using third party lesnes.The battery lasts a very ling time. To test the camera I took it to Disney's Animal Kingdom and the battery lasted all day (over 350 images taken plus a lot of reviewing and playing).This camera is great and performs in a pro manner. The white balance braketing is really cool (no more warm filters needed in overcast days). The images I took at 2:00 on a overcast day look like they were taken late afternoon on a clear day.I realy like that when you trasfer the images to your computer, all of the image info goes with it (and I mean all of the image info, even what lense you had on the camera {i.e. 70-200} and the actual mm the lense was at when the image was taken {i.e. 105}If you have any doubts about purchasing you can put them aside. Canon has really produced a spectacular camera that yields spectacular results.", "Date": "December 5, 2003"}, {"Title": "Goodbye analog, helooooo  EOS 10D", "Author": "John Kahrs", "ReviewID": "R3OIZVGELI2PI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ahh, the $1500  magic number. I couldn't resist, and finally succumbed to digital. I've been shooting for 20 years with medium format cameras, old rangefinders, and classic manual Nikon lenses on my old Nikkormat. For some time, I was certain that digital couldn't approach the qualities of film. I thought they'd never achieve the film effects that I got so easily with my traditional camera, like flaring highlights, shallow focus, atmospheric low-light stuff, skin tones, etc..  The digital images looked hi hi-rez video stillls, especially highlights- they looked like buzzy video.Well, the 10D does all these things, and does them better than film. I believe in the long run it does them cheaper, and it definitely does them faster, as I'm not scanning for 3 hours a night. The first lens I bought was a 35mm f2, and it's been fantastic. With the 1.6 focal length multiplier, it's similar to having a classic 50/1.4 on your film SLR. Very nice out-of-focus effects. With the 35/2 mounted and the camera on ISO 800, you'd have a hard time convincing me that any 800 spead film could come even close the images I've gotten. With a fast lens, the low light capability of this camera is astounding.  But that's just one of the good things. Having different ISO films in different cameras, or chanding film mid-roll, I am so not missing that hassle. There's no shutter lag to speak of. The build quality is very good.The engineering and interface design are absolutely first rate. If you've used older manual cameras and have a good understand of photography, you will be amazed at how intuitive the controls are. All the most often-used settings are right there under your fingertips- white balance, focus zones and servo behavior, drive rate, ISO settings and metering patterns. No matter what you're fiddling with or how deep into the menus you are, the shutter release puts you right back into shooting mode immediately. The control wheels on the top and back do just the things you'd expect them to in a given exposure mode, and they do it with a precision and certainty that left me never wanting to go back to my old cameras. (This is nothing new for anyone used to even a Canon Rebel G, but it's sobering for a classic camera user.) Choose exact shutter speeds or f-stops, or tweak exposure by half or third stops right there as you look through the viewfinder.I've seen talk on the web about softness in the images. Personally I'm pleased with it. You can always sharpen more later, and as they are straight from the camera, there are no aliasing artifacts at all. I believe the antialising filter is the source of this \"softness\". When you zoom into details, it looks more like a film image than a pixel-based digital image. How could anyone complain about that? Tight details like eye highlights- these look like organic details, not jaggy pixels. With over 3000 pixels across, I don't know what more people would want: you have to zoom in very tight to see this, so I don't know what people are expecting. At 8X10, prints look plenty sharp to me.What else . . . the metering is very good. Backlit subjects in front of windows are handled perfectly. The skin tones are just gorgeous. The flare control and color fidelity of the Canon lenses is very very good, and I'm using the cheap stuff. The L series is certainly better still if you're well heeled.The dynamic range is still definitely not as wide as that of film- maybe close to slide film, but any negative film on a bright sunny day still kicks the -- out of digital in terms the brightest and darkest tones it can capture. The 10D is light years ahead of  snapshot-type digital cameras in this regard.If I had one big gripe it would have to be the myopic feeling of looking through the viewfinder- a result of the CMOS chip being smaller than a standard 35mm frame. The optics of the viewfinder are still built for 35, just masked off for the smaller sensor size, so you sort of get the impression of looking down a long hallway at the image. If you've ever picked up a Canon EOS film camera, (or the new EOS 1Ds with its full frame chip) the big, glorious presentation is pretty impressive by comparison. That, coupled with the 1.6X focal length multiplication is such a waste of a lens capability- you're only getting the center 60% of the lens's image. (By the way, that one review in here that talks about multiplying or dividing the image resolution by 1.6 or whatever- it's complete cockamamie. It's the focal length of the lens that's multiplied. The resolution of the camera has nothing to do with it.) The whole 1.6X thing is a royal pain, and I'll be glad when full frame chips are cheap enough and the world can step back up and stop doing all the conversion stuff.Otherwise- its easily the best DSLR out there right now.", "Date": "June 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "Mega happy", "Author": "captain04 \"captain04\"", "ReviewID": "R3MBQ4X44TC5DP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my 10D for just over six months, taking mainly landscape/wildlife photos during that time.  I moved up from a Minolta film SLR and chose the 10D in preference to Nikon due to my experiences with the Powershot S400 (compatability of menu systems, software etc) and in preference to the Digital Rebel due to build quality/feel and the slightly faster FPS and improved buffer (important to me when trying to photograph animals).  I have a big trip to Alaska coming up where the camera will pay for itself with the savings in film/developing alone, never mind the instant feedback and convenience of not having to sort through 250 rolls of film when I get back.Overall experience with the 10D is very positive with minimal/no shutter lag, great autofocus speed, and the SLR type features often missing such as depth of field preview, mirror lock up etc.  If I have any issue with the camera it is the boot up time which seems like an age compared to simply turning on a film camera but isn't too unreasonable compared to other digital SLRs (the brand new Nikon being one of the few exceptions-at a price, mind).Other reviewers here and on other sites have commented on the soft focussing.  Never had an issue with it but I'm not shooting portraits of people but rather I'm normally using large depth of field.Picture quality has been consistently excellent.  Without trying to mess around with the white balance etc I find the color to be spot on and exposure is consistently where I expect it to be.  The additional exposure latitude of digital over slide film really helps on difficult to catch contrasty outdoor scenes and the 10D does a great job of making the most of it (comparing it to point and shoot digital images really brings out the differences).  I've printed numerous prints at 13\"x19\" on a Canon i9100 inkjet at home that are outstanding and exceed the quality that pro lab printed slides/negatives have achieved.Unfortunately, I managed to get the dreaded \"Error 99\" message a few weeks ago.  I use two new Canon lenses (28-135IS and 100-400IS) and a Sigma 12-24.  Seeing other comments about non-Canon lenses causing the problem, I called Sigma who confirmed the 12-24 is software compliant and shouldn't be the issue.  I called the Canon service hotline and after 20 seconds was actually speaking to a live body (amazing in this day and age).  The technician ran through all the things that could be tried to fix it and confirmed that the camera needed to be sent in for repair.  I mailed it on a Tuesday and received the camera back the following Wednesday (with the Memorial Day weekend in between) fully functioning, with a new shutter, updated software, and fully cleaned and running to factory specs.  Outstanding service response and an experience to put a smile on my face.  Highly recommended accessories to get for the 10D: 1) a second battery (good power usage but I take way more shots than I used to on film and it's not good to run out while in the middle of nowhere); 2) some form of cover for the LCD screen (hoodman peel-on/off work great and help protect it from scratches).", "Date": "June 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "big step up from non-SLR digital camera", "Author": "Jonathan Payne", "ReviewID": "R3FF24LRS60YX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I borrowed this camera for 10 minutes and decided I had to have one because there was no shutter lag.  It was like the old days before going digital.  Then I rented the camera for a weekend for $100 to make sure it made sense.  It's worth doing just to see if you are willing to lug around a big camera again if all you're used to is compact cameras.  (We ended up buy a Canon s400 at the same time because this camera is too big for all occasions.)Things I like:Just being back in SLR land again.  The first thing you notice after you take a few pictures is how different they look with an SLR.  It's much easier to create pictures with a small depth of field with a big 35mm lens, and it's a dramatic difference from 95% of the pictures you take with a regular digital camera (they usally have a very large depth of field).I like the 6 megapixels.  Your cropping options increase a lot with this resolution.I love the 3.3 fps, burst up to 9 images at once.  I've captured my kids in action in ways that was never possible before.I love the AI auto focus mode where as long as the button is pressed the camera will focus on the subject in the center focus point.  I use that to track my daughter playing soccer.I love the view finder.  Just looking through it is a beautiful thing.  Fast, informative, what you see is what you get, etc.The camera's controls are pretty easy but I found I had to read the manual several times before it all sunk in.  OK, it hasn't all sunk in yet ... but there's hope.Things I don't like:The pictures often do look softer than I would like.  My olympus c4040 took amazingly sharp images in comparison.  I have not figured out if I can just adjust the sharpness in the camera's settings to fix this.  I have not made the leap to RAW image format even though I have the software to manage that.At night time the camera has a hard time focusing.  My Olympus c4040 did a lot better in that respect.The automatic (green) mode for the camera does not allow you to specify a specific focus point (e.g., the center one).  It insists on guessing and while it often does a good job it also often fails to focus on the subject in the center.  It shows you what it is focusing on but if it's wrong you just have to release and press again until it picks the right spots.  And sometimes it doesn't.  So then you need to switch to P mode where you can specify a focus point to use, but then you lose all the automatic features of the camera (like popping up the flash when necessary).  All this is OK but you then need to explain this to your spouse who may or may not care about all these details.  I wish Canon would make it possible to specify a focus point in automatic mode.  I'd have to say that is my biggest gripe.It's not entirely clear to me yet which settings are permanent and which ones are reset when you turn the camera off.  I like P mode as a substitute for automatic (green box) mode because I can specify a focus point.  But I am not sure whether that means I have to manually adjust all the other settings or whether they will be automatically adjusted for me.  I know, for example, that the flash does not pop up automatically in P mode.Summary:Oh, so don't get me wrong.  This camera ROCKS.  Also it's nice to realize that this camera has upgradeable firmware.  If there is an issue or if enough people complain about the sharpness, or if there are new features that must be implemented, it's nice to think that a lot of it is just a firmware upgrade away.  I hope that's not naive of me.I suggest you try this camera out before buying it, if you are coming from a regular digital camera, that is.Good luck!", "Date": "November 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2ELPAFC0M2DRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I moved to this camera about two weeks ago from my Olympus E-10.  The E-10 was a fine camera with great glass.  I got some excellent photos from it.  But the Canon 10D is in all ways a superior piece of hardware.  It takes great photos, even in the fully automatic mode.  You can use it as a point and shoot, or adjust the controls while you learn the finer points of photography.I purchased a 28-135mm IS USM lens here at Amazon to use with the camera, and it gives me a lot of versatility.  A lot of 10D users seem to like this lens for general use.One of the most impressive features of the camera is its auto exposure ability.

I tried to use a Quantaray lens to compare, but it only worked part of the time. Possible compatibility issue. Canon IS 28-135 is good and has it's uses, but try the Tamron Di lenses for true sharpness!Update: This camera was used for years after I did this review. It never failed me. Considering the price of the camera, but then calculating costs of film and developing, it paid for itself in a year. I was a serious shutter bug back then! I am a bit more laid back now, but I stuck with Canon. I now own a 20D after selling the 10D on eBay. I love photoshop, so I am sticking with this camera. I was tempted by the 30D. I discovered that model had changes to the parameters in the auto modes did not allow post processing for computer viewing like the 20D. Maybe they changed it for later models, but my 20D does it for me so why keep spending money? If you don't want to go broke, the 20D by now should be dirt cheap if you can find one.

Having had an AE-1 and A-1 from the mid-70's and early 80's, I had enjoyed using their products, which seemed to do as much as, or sometimes more, than a Nikon, at a lower price.  In 1992, I purchased a Canon EOS 10S, a truely versitile camera.  With the Canon EOS 10-D, Canon has done it again, and am I glad.Somewhere along the late 1990's, I got into a digital camera phase, buying a different camera every year or so, usually with more megapixels, perhaps a few more features, but I realized that I had reverted back to taking \"snapshots,\" and not true \"pictures.\"  \"Pictures,\" to me, are where you experiment and your equipment allows you to experiment, and with the Canon EOS 10D, you can truly experiment.  When I think of the money I spent on the Coolpix and Photosmart cameras, and the frustrations, and limitations, I had with them, my wallet wants to cry.  However, with the 10D, I can be as creative as I want, and still have those times when I can put the camera on \"automatic\" and let someone else take a shot and not worry if the picture will come out (which was not always the case).But, let's get down to specifics.  I've had the 10D for several months now, and here are my recommendations:  1)  Wherever you buy it at, I bought mine here along with 512MB of memory, consider the whole price.  Some places are selling it for $$$$'s less, but you pay up to $$$ more for the memory and you have to pay for shipping (which from Amazon came in two days); 2) Your other EOS lenses work well on the 10D, but because of the 1.6 focal length difference (or whatever you want to call it), use that money you saved on it to get a terrific lense with a wider range, starting at 19mm or so; 3) The manual is a dream, considering this is one complicated camera.  Make a photocopy of the \"Nomenclature\" 2 pages and keep it next to the book as you read it; 4) If you are just getting into digital and have, in the past, used high-end film equipment (whether it was Canon or Nikon, etc.), don't buy something less thinking, \"I'll see if I like it.\"  With this camera you can equate 99% of everything you did with your high-end film camera, only with faster results.  Save money by buying a better quality digital camera, like the 10D, from the start, or in other words, if you are used to quality, don't take a step back.  If you have any reservations, you may want to consider buying \"A Short Course in Canon EOS 10D Photography\" by Dennis Curtin (ISBN 1-928873-39-1).  It covers most of the principles of digital photography and is written around the 10D.  Finally, the last great quality of this camera that I'll write about is the battery.  It lasts forever, but even when it starts petering out, it recharges in 1/10th of the time my AA high-metal batteries did for my other cameras.

Buffington", "ReviewID": "R1G8VFY7OLW4ZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera and its direct competitor, the Nikon D100, herald the death of film.  With the Canon EOS-10D you can take gorgeous pictures in digital format with all of the advantages generally associated with conventional film. You can use the full array of Canon's excellent line of autofocus lenses interchangeably with the 10D.  The exposure system on the 10D compares very favorably with the best of Canon's conventional film SLR cameras. But with a 6.3Megapixel camera like the 10D you can save the pictures to disk (CD, DVD or Hard Disk) or print them out, all without paying extra money for either film or developing.  Plus, you can delete bad shots \"on the fly.\"  With a 512MB CF card you can store hundreds of images depending on the quality you select, download them to your computer, and then re-use the card.  There just aren't many advantages to using film anymore, and in my opinion there are no significant ones for the vast majority of photographers.  In fact, it is notorious that once photogs try digital, many or most of them never go back to film.The 10D is beautifully built, with a rugged metal body and quality construction throughout.  Canon really went all-out to make this their flagship for the near-professional digital SLR line.I had the privilege of shooting the Canon 10D and Nikon D100 side-by-side.  The differences were not particularly significant in my opinion, and the two cameras are pretty similar, although there are differences, a detailed discussion of which is beyond the scope of this review.  I will say that I cannot imagine any photographer except pros with certain very specialized needs failing to be pleased with this camera or, for that matter, with its Nikon competition the D100.The other huge advantage of digital versus film is that any user owning a PC and fairly inexpensive software can post-process the D10 images very effectively.  Digital processing on one's personal computer gives the average person with a little practice more control by far over the images, in fact, than the professional developer in a conventional chemical/film darkroom can exercise.  The digital darkroom has arrived, and it is affordable to almost anyone these days! At $1,400 or so, this camera is a very decent value for what you get.  For those who really want a digital SLR with interchangeable lenses, but who cannot quite handle the pricetag of the 10D, Canon also offers the Digital Rebel, which while somewhat less capable than the 10D, is also a good camera for less money.

Both have reportedly been excellent cameras.With the 10D, I've used a Canon 50mm/compact macro, a Tamron 28-200mm and a Canon 15mm fisheye lens. Because of the difference in the way a film camera and this digital camera operate, you multiply the focal length of the lens by 1.6 to figure the effective focal length when used with a digital camera. So, for example, the 15mm fisheye lens is effectively a 24mm lens on the 10D.I bought a 1 gig IMB microdrive storage card and that allows me to take 400 high res jpg or about 160 raw format files. If you shoot in auto mode, the camera will only capture in jpg format. If you shoot in manual mode, you can select jpg or raw format.If shooting raw format, ensure you have a software program, such as Photoshop CS, that will open raw files. And know that not all developing and printing shops will accept raw format. But many of the image libraries will ONLY accept raw files (or a high resolution tif scanned from a slide).With the raw format files, I've found that many of my shots require a bit of exposure adjustment, but this is simply a matter of moving a slider bar in Photoshop CS. When you first open a raw file, you get an adjustment window allowing you to play with exposure, tint, saturation, white balance and more. You can even simulate warmup filters and such. Very cool stuff!I bought an extra battery to take along on trips. One battery typically lasts me for 2 days of shooting, as long as I don't do much reviewing of my shots through the camera monitor.Unless you need the quality of the 1Ds immediately I would recommend getting the 10D because technology is moving so fast that the quality of the 1Ds will be available for the current price of the 10D in the near future.", "Date": "July 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "From the newbie's perspective...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1MHC205AWFKGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a brand new photographer just learning the ropes, and this is the first digital camera I've owned, so my review is from that perspective...I'd been thinking for a while about learning some basic photography, and although getting such an expensive camera wasn't the initial plan, the EOS 10D turned out to be the best deal, when considering the number of features and quality of images.  Here's what I liked about it: - it's good enough.  Even if Canon or someone else comes out with a new model next year that's a little bit better (more pixels, additional features, etc.), it won't matter.  This is a feature-packed camera on which I can learn a wide variety of photographic techniques, and still be happy with it when I get to a higher level of proficiency.  It cost more up front, but I'll still have this camera while my friends swap out 4 or 5 (or more) of the $500-ish digital cameras, and I'll be producing better pictures the whole time with the better quality camera. - it's great (idiotproof) at point and click.  Camera arrived 3 days before our trip to Vegas.  No time to learn how to use it (besides the very basics), so I largely used it as a point and click while I was there.  Despite my utter lack of skill, I still came away with several hundred really awesome photos.  This camera is very forgiving and can do most of the work for you, which is key for beginners. - easy to use buttons.  This was my first digital camera - period.  Hadn't even used someone else's digital camera much.  Despite this, I found the menus and buttons pretty intuitive.  With just some basic browsing, I was able to find the things I needed.I would caution other beginners, though, that the user's manual assumes that you understand something about cameras and photography.  I found that I needed to read up on basic photography terms and techniques to understand what the manual was trying to tell me.  Fortunately, as I said, the buttons are pretty intuitive, so you don't need the manual to do basic things.Aside from that, I have to echo the exhuberance of others - no more swapping out film every 24-36 shots is GREAT!!!  So is the instant gratification of seeing the picture right away.In conclusion, the money that was devoted to this camera (plus the lens, flash, 1/2GB memory card, etc., etc.) was very well spent - haven't regretted it for a second.

The user interface on this camera is the best I have seen.

Yes, it could be higher, but remember - this is the same resolution you are going to get from a frame of 35mm film you have turned into PhotoCD images. I don't reall know what more to add - I am still speachless about just how great this camera is. I guess the best thing to compare it to would be to take your favorite 35mm SLR and toss in all the capabilities of your favorite digital then add a bunch more features to it. It is that perfect.

They have a definite hit on their hands and deserve the biggest kudos.Additional stuff: One of my other hobbies is astronomy. I love to take pictures of the night sky. After doing a lot of film based astrophotography, I figured that this camera would be great to play with as well. It is even better than I could ever hope for! Being able to do 30 second exposures at ISO 1600 with very little noise is a real treat. Started off by shooting at ISO 800 and they came out just as good as the 800 speed film I usually use. So, just for grins, I kicked it up to 1600 to see what would happen. As soon as the first image finished and popped up on the LCD, I knew I was going to be really happy with the camera! Took a bunch of 30 second pics of Sagitarius and the dust lanes and dark patches of the center of our galaxy are wonderful! By doing this I did discover a nasty with the camera - you are stuck using the focusing screen that Canon puts in. This may not be a big deal to most, but when shooting the sky it helps to have brighter screens available. Maybe this will change some day. Anyway, since the image is kind of dim, you may want to drag along a laptop so you can see right then if the camera is in focus or not.

I think that I have figured out the focusing problem that people have been dealing with.  When using a cheaper lens, such as the standard ef 28-80, due to the great decrease in lens quality around the outside of the lens, the seven-point autofocus system tries to compensate for it by creating a somewhat average focus on one's subject.  I noticed this and for cheaper lenses, and have found a solution.  If you switch the camera to program mode, you can select to utilize only the center autofocus point, which gives you crisp, in-focus images.  When you get a better lens, such as a fixed lens or one of Canon's L lenses, you can use all seven autofocus points, and the pictures will turn out great.As to the 1.6x magnification due to the smaller sensor, I barely notice it.  As pertaining to the other review that said that it ends up resulting in a lower resolution, this is not neccessarily true.  This could happen, but to find the resulting resolution you would not just divide the resolution by 1.6, other methods would have to be utilized.

I've now used it for almost two months in a variety of situations and it hasn't let me down yet. I upgraded my digital camera and aspirations when I purchased this camera. I've never had a real SLR before as I used my Dad's 25 years ago when I was in high school so this was a big step up. I've found the colors to be quite accurate and the pictures are reasonably sharp -- and can be adjusted in camera if you need extra sharpness. I really love the histogram display on the back and the controls are well placed to stay within reach. And, the battery life is outstanding; I'm currently at 336 pictures on one battery and only now am I getting the warning light.I bought this with two all-purpose lenses that let me cover most of the situations I expected to find myself in as I began to understand this camera: a 28-105mm zoom and a 70-300mm zoom. Both lenses work quite well with the autofocus system; although it sometimes hunts a bit with the bigger zoom, it's easy to switch to manual focus and move onwards.There are a few drawbacks but these are really tradeoffs that I consciously made when I purchased this camera. The camera is a bit heavy but that helps reduce camera shake when you take pictures. I've found the autofocusing system to be something that I need to get used to; I expected this to be part of my learning curve as I wasn't used to a sophisticated approach to this with the lesser cameras that I've been using.To get the most out of this camera, it really does take a few weeks of experimentation with the controls. It is complex enough that this isn't a good choice for a casual photographer but I suspect that the price would point them towards a more typical point-and-shoot camera anyway.

Pomeroy", "ReviewID": "R2ZN1H8WTFW67D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Back in 2003 the 10D was hot stuff, only one step below the 1D and 1Ds; as of 2011 most of its value has depreciated away, and consequently it's very cheap on the used market. I bought one for \u00a375, which feels wrong, but I'm not complaining. I actually got hold of it it so that I could have it converted into an infrared camera, and it's a popular base for conversion because it's cheap and fairly robust, with a metal body and decent shutter life. Unfortunately it was released just before Canon launched the EF-S range, and so you can't easily mount EF-S lenses unless you're prepared to modify them. This limits your choice of ultra-wide lenses, although as far as I know ultrawides from Sigma and Tamron and so forth will work fine. If you have a Canon 10-22mm you might want to look at a second-hand 350D instead. (I would avoid the 300D; it's slow, not much smaller than the 10D, the firmware is less functional, it's apparently less robust, and a lot of them were thrashed by their owners).Good stuff: In typical Canon style the interface and general operation are mostly sensible and there aren't any obvious quirks, apart from the overcomplicated custom white balance procedure. The body feels tough, and the battery grip is available fairly cheaply (it also fits the D30 and D60). ISO 100-400 are still fine by modern standards, ISO 800 is okay, ISO 1600 decent at a pinch, ISO 3200 not so much. There's nothing wrong with the colours. It takes ordinary compact flash cards - there isn't a 2gb limit - and Canon's then-standard BP-511 batteries, which are still available on eBay and so forth. Autofocus is much better than the earlier D30/D60 and is again fine by modern consumer standards, although it's not a 1D. 6mp is plenty for most purposes. It uses standard E-TTL (the top professional flash at the time was the 550EX). The grip rubber remains intact, unlike e.g. the grip rubber on the Nikon D1x.Good or bad stuff: The feature set is extremely spartan, reminiscent of the original 5D (although instead of using picture styles it has simple colour / contrast profiles). It doesn't have face-detect autofocus, an electronic spirit level, live view, a movie mode, in-camera panoramas, in-camera HDR, GPS, built-in wireless flash control, none of that. It just takes pictures.Bad stuff: It's slow. You get used to it, but compared to a modern camera it's like using an old PowerMac G3. If you're shooting a fast-moving sports event you'll learn to curse the BUSY display on the monitor, during which you can't review your images. Flicking through the images on the card is a frustrating process, and it even takes a second or so to generate the histogram. It gets worse if you plan on transferring the images from the camera to your computer with a USB cable - I did this on holiday once, trying to save space in my bag by not packing a card reader - because it takes a minute or more to transfer a single image. You can scroll around images on the tiny LCD screen, but this uses the wheel and a \"left-right, up-down\" toggle that's not much fun. The 20D introduced a little joystick.In fact the 20D is the better camera. A year or so ago the 20D still fetched a decent price on eBay, although recently it seems to have crashed down to \u00a330 or so more than the 10D. Perhaps people are offloading their old camera gear in light of the economic downturn; digital SLRs were one of the big luxury boom items during the boom times, people took out loans to buy them so they could take holiday snapshots. Still, I digress. If you can afford the extra, by all means get a 20D instead.In general the 10D is still a solid, decent camera that's as good as it was back in 2003; my 5D MkII produces much larger files, but the colours, contrast aren't obviously different at lower ISOs. It suffers from the same problem as Nikon's D50, D70 etc, in that subsequent cameras added features without reducing the image quality, and so the 10D ends up the least-best choice rather than the most-worst, if you see what I mean.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply Perfect", "Author": "Tom N Carello \"XeoniteDog\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZH97Q6OM1HT4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is simply perfect.

It's old: not that that's bad, but the fact that they haven't put out a driver for Windows 7 makes me think Canon kind of forgot about this model.2. Being so old, it can't mount EF-S lenses. I realized this a couple minutes before I wrote this review, and now I'm probably going to have to write a review on some converters.

I had blown it up to 12X18 and it looked great without any noise.  I figured that in a long run cost of films and developing costs would even out if I take more than 1000 pics a months.  It is so much fun when you are shooting like a pro photographer and not worrying about running out of films and you can always print the ones you like, not all of them.Just one word:  Get it if you can afford one and you will never look back to film cameras.", "Date": "June 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Canon 10D", "Author": "Ramon", "ReviewID": "R1ZYDZCLOJYUTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera 3 days ago and I just received it, the delivery was flawless with FedEX, I followed the tracking and they told me when it arrived at the Fedex Hub. I went and picked it up right away. the camera was packed real nice as to arrive safely from Georgia to Puerto Rico, when I opened it I was in awe, this camera is a hell of a camera its made of Magnesium. its great I bought this camera for my wife to learn but I think I'm keeping it for myself, the camera is in great shape and I want to thank KEH Camera shop. for great rapid service and a great quality product.What a great Camera it is! I've taken A few great shots already but Im waiting until I can get a better lense in the 50mm range. and then Ill test it real nice. but I uploaded a few of my first shots here with it of a homeless cat and a Palm tree. hope you all like it. If you're trying to move to learn photography this is the camera for you, this thing is built like a tank to give you an example of her size, shes bigger than all the Canon EOS Cameras 20D.30D.40D.50D.60D and even the 7D I love it. when I go out shooting People ask me what News paper I work for, I look like a Pro and I'm just your average Joe LOL. So if you want to look like a Million bucks when you go out shooting Pick yourself a 10D in good condition and enjoy the looks people give you plus the great pictures you'll get.

The problem is with the CMOS chip.  It's smaller than Full Frame 35 mm.  This means that you must multiply the lens focal length by 1.6 to get the effective focal length (for both the 10D and the Digital Rebel).Anybody buying this camera should first price out lenses, or check their current focal lenghts to see if they will be able to do what they want.  My 20-35 equates to a 32-56mm, not as wide as I would like, though my 35 f2 will be a great Normal and my 50 f1.4 will be great for portraits.  Amature sports photographers will love the focal magnification as they can now use reasonably priced lenses for long shots! (the 200mm becomes 320mm, with a 1.4 converter close to 450mm)The digital Rebel comes with a 18 -55 mm (aprox 29 - 88mm), unfortunatly this is stearing me to the lower quality Rebel.

I was always very happy with my Canon film cameras.  I bought the 10d thinking that I was finally able to get a digital replacement for my old Canon film cameras.I have now owned my 10d for over a year.  The picture quality is only fair.  It often selects ISO 100 and gives me fuzzy pictures. The white balance is extremely poor compared with the film cameras.  The \"full automatic\" mode does a poor job of focus and white balance.  The \"creative\" modes are similar to the film cameras but don't seem to work so very well.  I am just having a terrible time trying to get the settings right to get good pictures!  After a year of trying I am extremely frustrated with it.Finally, the print pictures I get from it are _always_ too dark.  It seems I need to post-process EVERY PICTURE in photoshop to get the gamut correct, or brighten/enhance/correct the photos to make them look right.  Argh!It's all probably user error, but I never had these problems with my old film cameras.  If I could easily get PhotoCDs made I would go back to film immediately!UPDATE:  Okay, I bought PhotoShop CS for my Mac.  I have taken some of my old 10d photos and run this sequence:Auto LevelsAuto Brightness/ContrastSaturation +30 (variable)Unsharpen Mask (this one takes the most tweaking)This has _really_ made a huge difference in the quality of the photos.  I have done a lot more adjustment with some of the photos.  Photoshop is _really_ amazing what it can do.
