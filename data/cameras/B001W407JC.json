However, it would not be acceptable to most adults. The display screen is tiny and the menus and buttons are not very intuitive and hard to read.  Overall the camera feels very cheap and toy-like. I did not download any pictures to the computer but the picture quality on the microscopic display looked fair-to-poor. Spend a few more bucks and get a \"real\" camera like a Canon or Nikon.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Johnny R.

Thank you Amazon for being true to your word about that, though I was a bit disappointed that I was not reimbursed for my postage. It should not be my liability for receiving damaged goods.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001W407JC"}}
