{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Olympus C-4000", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R3B1SVR9Q0A0B8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Four primary factors pushed me to buy the Olympus C-4000.1. I already own an Olympus D460 Zoom and have been very happy with it. The Camedia software is the best I have found for fixing pictures that are under-exposed or off color, and that is saying a lot. I have used many of the main image software including Microsoft and Adobe and the Camedia is still the best in my opinion.2. Cost - when compared to the Canon G2, which in my opinion is the only other camera close in the 4.0 MP league, there was a $200 to $250 price difference. The on-camera ease-of-use features are slightly less on the Olympus C-4000, meaning you need to go into more menus and adjust things manually instead of turning a dial or pushing a button, but overall the camera will do all the same things that the G2 can.3. Batteries - The largest cost savings advantage is the savings you get in batteries. The G2, and many other cameras like it, require special batteries. The C-4000 will run on 4-AA batteries. Of course standard alkaline will run out quickly, but using NiMH rechargable batteries works EXCELLENT. They last a very long time and you can use them over and over again. The camera comes with 2-CVR3 batteries, but don't let that scare you, the literature clearly states you can use standard AA batteries.4. Maximum PC Magazine put the Olympus C-4000 head-to-head with the Canon G2 and several others and the C-4000 came out on top. Their review is worth reading. Their motto is (and it is on the cover of each magazine) \"Maximum PC, Minimum BS\" and they certainly live up to that claim in my experience so far.", "Date": "November 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "Best Value for a 4MP Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3ERY9D5YIY0BF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WHO IT'S FOR: With its complete set of manual controls, the Olympus C-4000 is for the serious amateur photographer or a novice wanting to learn a lot more about photography. If you're one who would rather just point-and-shoot, this camera or its rivals (like the Canon S45) is NOT for you, better just save your $200 and go for the cute compact types.Granted that YOU ARE serious about your photography BUT you are on a tight budget, then this camera is perfect for you. The 4MP is just right for the occasional 8x10 prints and more than enough quality for 5x7 prints. Among the competition (Canon S45/G2, Nikon Coolpix 4300, Sony S85), its price and features stand out.I bought this camera here at Amazon 5 months ago for 2 main reasons:- given the features and full manual controls, it had the most competitive price among the competition.- although not included in the package, the camera uses standard 4 AA-sized NiMH rechargeable batteries.I brought the camera to Europe for my honeymoon and have taken 300+ pictures with it. I am extremely pleased with it. Prints on 4x6 came out as crisp as my 20-year-old SLR (the excellent Nikon F3), and sometimes better (mainly because you can preview a shot and tweak exposure and composition without worrying about the cost of film: an obvious advantage for all digicams).PROS:- excellent daylight exposures on full auto or manual modes.- a fully-charged set of AA NiMH batteries lasts me two days of shooting 60+ pictures and previewing the LCD, something the proprietary batteries of other digicams would be hard-pressed to match.CONS:- You have to remember to remove the cap before turning the camera on -- an annoyance for all C-class Olympus cameras. Forgetting that doesn't damage the camera, but it's an annoyance still.- No remote control. You have to turn on the timer every time if you want to be in the picture or you want to take long exposures.- The lens cap more often than not gets removed inadvertently when removing or replacing the camera in its case. Be sure to always bring lens tissues or whatever you use to clean lenses.- The paltry 16MB card that comes with it. Although all camera brands have this fault of not including enough memory, I hoped Olympus would just do the right thing and pack it with a 128MB card.RECOMMENDATIONS:- Always have two sets of 4 AA NiMH batteries. Buy the Olympus B-50SU Quick Charger or the Kodak Max K2000 Battery Charger. They both come with 4 NiMH AA batteries and works whatever a country's voltage is. Then buy an additional set of 4 Kodak Max 1850mAh NiMH batteries.- Buy at least 2 128MB SmartMedia cards. Each 128MB card stores about 60-70 pictures at full 4MP SHQ resolution. Better still, bring your laptop along when going on extended vacations to backup your pics. I made the mistake of not bringing mine and had to look for shops to transfer my pics to CDs whenever space on my cards were running out.Finally, just go ahead and buy it (with the charger, extra batteries and extra memory cards). It's an excellent camera given its features and price.", "Date": "June 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "Olympus C4000: The Best Four Megapixel Digital Camera Deal!!", "Author": "Roy Chan", "ReviewID": "R2825Y4XFZ4M8L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Lots of manual options, incredible feature set, superb four megapixel digital images, Fantastic optics for color and clarity, Manual and automatic controls for pros and debutants, Very little lag, Excellent image quality and easy to use buttons, Fast, Many settings and options, great zoom ratio, nice control layout, nice size LCDCons: Slightly Heavy, Not as cool looking as other cameras, 8 MB Storage card supplied with camera is woefully inadequate, User manual, software kind of plain, battery life, Size of pictures and erase features are not what I would like.Summary: The C-4000z is a very impressive digital camera and for the price it can't be beat. This camera packs a serious punch with features only found on higher end digital cameras. I have been using digital cameras for the past four years from Kodak to Sony but this one out beats them all. Now I won't beat around the bush and say there are no flaws with the cam, the first being the batteries shipped with the cam (they are one time use only)! So right off the bat you have to spend a couple more dollars for rechargeable batteries. The batteries I got I'm able to take about 200 hundred high res. (TIFF) pictures before being replaced. The second problem is the small memory card shipped with the cam (at the time of my buy Olympus was giving free 64 mb cards with mail in rebate). The camera does come with a owners manual but has very limited information in it, for a extensive manual you have to read it off the installation disk in PDF form which isn't bad for me because it makes it a little easier to look something up using the word find feature. Now for the good things about the camera. This camera is packed with features and this should be taken into account if your new to digital cameras there is a lot to take in. Everything is arranged on the camera that makes it easy to navigate and set up. Olympus even went and put a user choice setting button which is nice if you use certain setting such as focal length, shutter speed etc. which enables you to set your preferences and return to them without having to set the whole camera up again. The pictures that result from this camera are amazing! I was at Yosemite a couple of weeks ago and shot some impressive pictures which I framed and had hanging on my wall a service tech who was doing some work in my house actually wanted to know where I had bought the pictures. Several other features that Olympus thought of were the ability to attach an external flash (optional). The camera also gives you the ability to crop pictures right on the camera. The panoramic feature takes a little to get used to but works really well. I don't want to bore you with the fine details (exposure settings, shutter speeds etc) but just wanted to let you know if your looking for a decent digital camera at a fair price the C-4000z is for you. Oh just one more thing a little tip I use all the time, If you happen to have a smart media card take it along with you to your local camera shop or electronic store and ask the sales person if you can insert your card and try the camera. You can then take the card home and if you have a media reader or printer that has a reader built in you can see the results of the camera prior to buying it (just a suggestion). It also gives you the opportunity to see how your digital dark room will do when it come to printing from this camera.", "Date": "April 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "it is the best game \"slackjawed001\"", "ReviewID": "R13HI61AZYHEXG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "They almost got it right.  I have owned mine for about 2 months now and have learned enough to make an informed comment.The camera takes very sharp pictures, and most of the time the color is true.  I love the ability to manually adjust everything, and the ability to adjust flash levels has come in very handy for me.The main problem with this camera is big, but stupid.  It has a lens cap instead of a retractable lens.  That isnt the bad part.  The REALLY stupid part, is you HAVE to remove the lens cap before you turn on the camera, or the lens tries to extend, and it bangs into the cap which is attached to the body of the camera, not the lens.  All this technology and this was the solution for the lens cap?  I am still suprised that this is how the camera works.It is excellent that you have the ability to manually adjust everything, however it is a bit cumbersome until you get accustomed to it.  You cannot be adjusting and taking pictures \"on the fly\".  It is too hard to do that.  Set the camera for the best general setting you are in and keep shooting.  I had lots of problems taking pictures indoors of my one year old running around.  Every shot was blurred, even if she wasnt moving very much.  I had to change from \"point and shoot\" to manually setting the ISO to 400.  That fixed the blurring problem.  I now leave it at 400 for all general shooting.  It is nice that it has a button you can program settings into, so you can use a one button push to change to your prefered settings.  I havent used this option yet, but I know it will be helpful.The other big bonus for me on this camera was the ability to add lenses.  This may be why the lens isnt retractable.  I am going today to get some filters, and possibly a wide angle lens for it.  I looked at many cameras that didnt have this ability.  I am crossing my fingers that the lenses dont behave like the lens cap.  If they do, I will make another review probably somewhat different than this one.Bottom line for me, is that it is much better than my old Cannon 2MP camera....  I have grown accustomed to the lens problem and I dont even think twice about taking off the cap first.  The menus...well, I am still working on those.  If you buy one, plan on there being a learning curve involved.Knowing what I do now, I would still buy this camera.", "Date": "November 12, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera, Unbelieveable Price", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "R2M8M15L8JN3YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the Olympus C-4000 from a 2 MPix camera about a month ago and have taken about 400 photos since.  I am very impressed with the results.First the plusses:  Photos are extremely sharp.  Very high quality output - no comparison to my old 2 MPix model.  The pre-programmed modes are convenient and work great.  Automatic mode is a decent default setting if you're in a hurry or don't have a pre-programmed setting for some shot (not as common as you'd think).  Really very easy to switch from mode to mode.  Camera is also very comfortable to hold and use.  Everything is adjustable on this thing.  If I find something I don't like (too much lag between pushing the button and taking the picture), there is usually a remedy (change to contiouous focus mode which makes the camera focus change wherever you point it without pushing 1/2 way - burns up batteries that way).Only negative is that in manual mode, it is a major pain to jump from menu to menu adjusting apeture, exposure, etc.I recommend this camera for anyone looking to upgrade.", "Date": "September 14, 2002"}, {"Title": "First Time Digital Camera Users - We Love This Camera", "Author": "Satisfied Customers", "ReviewID": "R515ILKVEO3YR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With research and talking to everyone we could think of before buying, we finally decided on the Olympus -- which we took on an extended New England vacation to see the ocean and the changing fall colors of the area.  Terrific subject matter for testing out a new camera.  We also took a 35mm Nikon and used 200, 400, and 800 film.  All pictures are back now to compare and WOW!  Considering we didn't know everything about properly using the Olympus digital, we were amazed at the pictures!  The colors were often better and more true in digital than the Nikon 35 mm.  The digital pictures had much better lighting indoors by far (compared to our 35mm) when we were inside large buildings, like old barns, museums, and a manufacturing plant, where a flash was useless.  The digital camera picked up details at great length with excellent exposure and clarity. It also had zoom capabilities, and for our picture taking style, it is the only part of the camera we wish offered more -- more zoom. Another great feature to us was that it has rechargable batteries. We recharged at the end of each touring day and were ready to go again the next day. We took several hundred pictures and nearly every one was a keeper.", "Date": "November 7, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent features/price ratio.", "Author": "Eugene Mah \"physics geek\"", "ReviewID": "R61V4MG4EGBIX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very full featured camera for not a lot of money compared to other similarly equipped cameras out there.Relatively compact size with a nice comfy handgrip.  Menu features are easy to access, although this sometimes makes it difficult to quickly customize your shot (such as setting f-stop, shutter speed, ISO, etc).  Fortunately, the automatic mode takes very good pictures and does a good job adapting to lighting conditions.  One of the buttons can be set to access a feature you commonly want to change, such as picture resolution or ISO.  Two of the menu items can also be customized for quicker access to shot settings.It does a much better job at focusing in low light conditions and seems to be a little easier on batteries than older Olympus C model cameras I've used.  The flash is adequate, although if you want to light things up more than 5 meters away, you'll probably need something with a little more oomf.  The viewfinder is reasonably accurate (actual photo is a little bit larger than what's seen in the viewfinder), but for close-up shots you'll want to use the LCD.One nice feature I have been taking advantage of is the ability to take panorama shots using panorama-compatible Olympus SM cards (the cards will indicate this compatibility).  Switch to Panorama mode and you get two boxes on either side of the LCD that you can use to help with registration.Overall, an excellent camera with tons of features for the price.", "Date": "January 8, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2OVBLOQVB2DV4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as an upgrade from a 1.3 Mega Pixel camera.

I tell everyone who asks that I think Olympus makes the best camera for the money, bar none.I got the C-4000 because I wanted more flexibility...and I got it.  It's as easy to use as you want it to be but as powerful as you'd like it to be thanks to things like aperature and shutter priority.  It's the first digicam I've owned where I can dial in depth of field via the aperature setting.  It's got a great lens and, in my humble opinion, the best CCD on the market.As for the non-retractable lens...  All of the C series cameras have a fixed lens to accomodate accessory Olympus or Tiffen lenses via a CL-1 adapter tube.  That makes the thing expandable.  You can even add filters if you want.  You'd be surprised how a simple polarizing filter can make a cloud shot simply pop.  You can't get that with a retractable lens.

I am an amature, but I wanted a camera that was resonably fast so that my photos would not be blurry when the subject moved a little. I had the Oly D-490 and could not get decent photos of my grandbaby because she is on the move when she is awake.  There are so many features that make this a great camera for beginners as well as more advanced photographers. The photos that I have taken indoors have been much better than my other camera. The flash seems to do a good job without much distortion of color. There is a delay between shots when using the highest resolution setting SHQ. This is somthing that people new to using digital cameras will have to get used to.  Many reviews complain about how fast digicams use up batteries.I strongly suggest using an external battery pack. I have been using a MAHA PowerBank for almost 3 years. I can take over 100 photos with it and then charge it back up in about an hour. That is while leaving the camera LCD viewer on. If I did not use the LCD viewer, I am sure the PowerBank would last longer. It costs around $50.00.  I don't plan on buying another camera until this one no longer functions.

Pics looked better printed than on screen. One could make out almost every blade of grass in my prints.It has almost every control one can imagine - and a few I hadn't thought of earlier. Exposure control in automatic mode is exceptionally accurate with slight tendency to overexpose.Minimal to no purple fringing..I've almost never noted it.A set of 4 Panasonic NiMh's lasts me a whole day worth of shooting with electrons left over for downloading pics.Supermacro is astounding - capturing details that  my 20/20 vision is not able to discern.Nightshots with noise reduction is amazing for their clarity.Kind to your wallet by being significantly cheaper than its nearest competitor - probably the G2/G3's from Canon.You can control - Focus/Shutter/Aperture/Flash/Exposure/Bracketing/ISO Speed/White Balance - plus more..and assign your favorite setting for quick recall at one go.I give it 4 stars and not 5 because of a lack of a hotshoe. This should have been included in a camera of this calibre.So - whats not to like?The push button menu driven interface is cumbersome - the C5050 interface is way better in this regard.Its easy to get your fingerprints on the lens - since the outer element of the lens sits on the edge of the barrel.Its easy to switch on the camera with the lens cap in place - and the camera makes grinding noises and beeps away. I assume that this does not damage the camera - I've done it a couple of times.Requires special cable to use flash and its a very cumbersome solution - lack of hotshoe is the biggest shortcoming and one that almost drove me to purchase the G3 instead.Move mode does not capture sound (the Canon's do)Summary - the camera to buy if pic quality and cost is of concern to you.

My first was a Camedia D-460 (1.3 mp.) It was a nice little camera that performed well for a couple of years, but I just need a little bit more. After a lot of research (go to any search engine and lookup \"Digital Camera Reviews\") the decision came down to 2 cameras in slightly different price ranges. The Olympus C4000 and the Canon G3 (the G3 is roughly $... more than the C4000). After some side by side comparisons of photos of the same subject, under the same conditions I decided to save some cash and selected the C4000. The test photo's were identical. (again same settings and picture environment)Initial setup of the C4000 was easy, I had it out of the box and taking pictures in about 15 minutes. Olympus provides a poster size quick start guide to help with the basics. Handling of the camera was quite easy. The controls are easy for a grown up to use. (some cameras have controls so small that its hard for an adult to use them) Olympus provided starter battery's but plan on buying a bunch of AA battery's and a recharger. Also plan on spending a few dollars on extra SmartMedia. It comes with a 16MB SmartMedia disk, but that is only enough for 13-16 HQ pictures. I wish I could tell you that the documentation that came with the camera was good, but I cant since the print is so small I honestly found it to be useless. (and I have perfectly good vision) The menu's are fiarly easy to navigate, and changing the cameras settings was not a problem. Taking portraits, and landscape pictures was fairly easy, but I found that taking 'action' shots were difficult. The camera has a long rebound time from picture to picture. (about 3 seconds or so) So, if you plan on taking action photo's of motocross, Nascar events or anything else that requires a fast transition from picture to picture, you might want to do more homework before buying this unit. Shooting video was OK, but anyone serious about digital video should be looking elsewhere. (the camera was OK for fun, little, 30 second videos of kids and pets)The software that came with the camera installed easily on Windows 98 and Windows XP platforms. Download's from the camera to your computer with the USB (auto connect) is fairly simple. Novice computer users shouldnt have a problem.Overall a great buy, and I would have given it 5 stars except Olympus got lazy with the User Documentation, but if you spend a little time on the Olympus Web Site, there are some pretty detailed Spec's and Manual's available to download.

Maybe as you are right now, I hesitated a lot between SLR or Digital, but, considering the large quantity of photos I am taking now for my newborn daughter, the possibility of sharing and re-taking and the scale economy of the digital era (eliminating film, processing and printing), by all means, digital is the best choice.The same options you seek in a SLR, you will find in this Camedia, because it can be adjusted manually (ISO, Aperture, exposure) or semi-automatic (portrait, landscape, both, also low light and fast action).Note: Fast moving objects (NASCAR or so), you have to pre-focus in order to get a good picture.Overall, I am delighted with this camera.Updated: Until Aug, 2004, over a year of use, this camera works perfectly, AA NimH rechargable batteries are cheap and last long, and a lot of great moments have been captured.

I have, until recently, been a know-nothing when it comes to cameras, digital or not.  I was the poster boy for disposable cameras until one day I just couldn't take it any more.  Digital cameras were appearing on the necks of the people all around me and the possibilities seemed outstanding.  So I finally took the plunge and bought this camera.Now, I know some readers are eager to read about the dazzling features and whatnot, but not the bulk of readers, because this camera is definitely not for pros.  It is clearly for two classes of users:1) total novices who want to be able to start snapping GREAT photos within 24hrs of receiving it, and look forward to growing into the cameras many great features,  and;2) dabblers, intermediate and amateur photographers who want superclear photos and a decent variety of bells and whistles to play with.You can get extensive technical reviews and specification sheets all over the net, so instead of giving you an amateurish rehash of all the information I gathered, here are two links that will be of great service to you as they were to me.w w w dot dpreview dot com, andw w w dot photo dot net/digital/cameras/choosingSo far, I've taken pictures at day and night and have been very pleased with both.  Since this camera has a built-in electronic flash, you must eventually read some articles about lighting or you'll never realize the latitude you can potentially have on making face shots look a lot better than just point-and-shoot.Consumer Reports Nov 2003 included this camera in it's review of 34 cameras and while they made no specific mention of the C4000, it was rated \"excellent\" for print quality.  It's other features were competitive and for the price made them seem like a bargain.Careful of the lens cap.  It's easy to forget to remove it before powering on whereby the lens automatically extends.  I read the lens gears are plastic so eventually this will grind them down.  I've read different opinions of battery life.  Consumer reports says a set of rechargeable batteries should result in 130 photos (I haven't taken that many yet).  The camera includes a small manual but the real manual is on disc and praised as a worthy read by many reviewers.  Don't let the accompanying software get you down.  It's meant to be basic and you can find plenty of image editing software online.  I personally recommend:- minimum 3yr extended warranty (1yr is standard and can go by fast.)- Battery Charger and 4 Extra 1800mAh Batteries (supercharger and 2000mAh+ batt if impatient)- USB media reader to free up your camera while transferring photos- 128MB Smartmedia (extra digital film)As a first time digital camera enthusiast, I am very happy with this purchase.  I rated it a 5, not in comparison to other cameras, but in comparison to my overall experience when making any kind of purchase.  I hope this review has been helpful.

There is a design flaw with the lens cap as mentioned below, but it can be rectified with an aftermarket lens cap called an olycap.But the beautiful outdoor pictures are negated by the slowness in focusing and acquiring images indoors.

Downes \"downfall4\"", "ReviewID": "R19DN4XSAQDMWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first want to say that I am a total novice. I probably have used about 1/10 of the features of this camera, and even then it's been great!  I took some pictures of my daughter that would rival a professional photographer's headshots. I then printed them in black and white, 8 x 10, and they were superb!  I did some of our two cats as well, and they, too, were excellent!  I especially like the option of no flash. More often than not, I will choose this feature over flash indoors because the warm tones are amazing. The flash pictures can be cold in comparison.  If you want to operate on a budget, here's what you can do:  1) Get a printer where you can easily figure out how to refill the black cartridges (color can be more difficult and the results unpredictable- who wants muddy skintones?)  Check out atlanticinkjet.com. Then you can print black and whites at home, and go to your local Wal-Mart, CVS, etc. to get reprints and edits done easily without the hassle of worrying about replacing your color cartridges.  2)  Get a Smart Media reader. They are relatively inexpensive, and they give you another option for quickly creating CDs that you can also bring to Wal-Mart rather than risking transporting your SmartMedia card and losing it or damaging it.  3) Use rechargeable NiMh batteries. They are cheap - about $7 for 4 of them. You will probably need at least 3 to 4 sets of 4. The chargers are also cheap.  3)Don't get conned into buying any package deals with lenses, etc.(this isn't an issue with buying from Amazon, but it can be with many Internet camera stores).  You will pay a reasonable price for the camera, but a hefty price for the accessories. I know because it happened to me!  So since I am a true novice with this camera, and still experiencing great results, I can recommend this camera. My one concern, however, and that may be a power issue, is that sometimes the camera initially shuts itself on and off. I also hope that the few times that I have forgotten to remove the lens cap have not been damaging to the lens. I am going to take the suggestion of several other positive users and use the adapter and UV filter which of course were bundled with all the over-priced accessories that I received.  So, have fun, and enjoy getting to know this camera!  And take lots of people pictures with no flash. Be aware that some will be blurry because you have to stay really still as does the subject, however, it will be worth it! Here is your accessory list:1) Printer will easily refillable inkjet cartridges (Lexmark Z55 works great for black refill); 2) SmartMedia or card reader for more than one type of memory card; 3) 3 to 4 sets of 4 NiMh batteries -readily available at Wal-Mart and you should be able to use them to replace AA batteries in other electronic devices; 4) Digital Camera bag - you might get lucky and find it at Wal-Mart or similar store with many accessories included; 5) battery charger for 4 NiMh batteries - also cheap at Wal-Mart; 6) 46mm conversion lens adapter - mine is Sakar Digital for Olympic 2000/2020/3000/3030 models; 7) set of 46 mm filters including UV filter to fit on lens adapter-I have Digital Optics Super High Resolution Multi-Coated; 8) Lens Cleaner and Wipe Cloth; 9) AC Adapter - I purchased switching universal power supply and set it to 6.5V at laptopsforless.com for about $20 - you might need this if you run out of rechargeables and you don't have AA batteries on hand, or if you are connecting using the USB cable and don't want to waste your batteries.  10) 4 - 128 mb SmartMedia cards - each should store about 200 or so photos of good quality - they can be found at very different prices, so check around.  Also, since it appears that newer cameras aren't sold with SmartMedia cards, you might want to purchase a few just for future use so they'll be readily available.

I have owned mine for about 2 months now and have learned enough to make an informed comment.The camera takes very sharp pictures, and most of the time the color is true.  I love the ability to manually adjust everything, and the ability to adjust flash levels has come in very handy for me.The main problem with this camera is big, but stupid.  It has a lens cap instead of a retractable lens.  That isnt the bad part.  The REALLY stupid part, is you HAVE to remove the lens cap before you turn on the camera, or the lens tries to extend, and it bangs into the cap which is attached to the body of the camera, not the lens.  All this technology and this was the solution for the lens cap?  I am still suprised that this is how the camera works.It is excellent that you have the ability to manually adjust everything, however it is a bit cumbersome until you get accustomed to it.  You cannot be adjusting and taking pictures \"on the fly\".  It is too hard to do that.  Set the camera for the best general setting you are in and keep shooting.  I had lots of problems taking pictures indoors of my one year old running around.  Every shot was blurred, even if she wasnt moving very much.  I had to change from \"point and shoot\" to manually setting the ISO to 400.  That fixed the blurring problem.  I now leave it at 400 for all general shooting.  It is nice that it has a button you can program settings into, so you can use a one button push to change to your prefered settings.  I havent used this option yet, but I know it will be helpful.The other big bonus for me on this camera was the ability to add lenses.  This may be why the lens isnt retractable.  I am going today to get some filters, and possibly a wide angle lens for it.  I looked at many cameras that didnt have this ability.  I am crossing my fingers that the lenses dont behave like the lens cap.  If they do, I will make another review probably somewhat different than this one.Bottom line for me, is that it is much better than my old Cannon 2MP camera....  I have grown accustomed to the lens problem and I dont even think twice about taking off the cap first.  The menus...well, I am still working on those.

This can be a pain if you forget to take the lens cap off, and the camera gives up on you (someone here reported this).3) If you're using 4 AA batteries instead of 2 powerful lithium ones, be sure to carry 4 more AA spares, since they run out very quickly.", "Date": "October 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Small Camera, Nice Pictures", "Author": "William B.

The LCD screen is large and sharp. The camera is not too tiny, so one can hold it more firmly and not get a hand cramp either. Like the tiny cell phones can do to you. I bought this for my wife as a gift. I may buy one for me, too.UPDATE....I did buy one. I liked it, however, after using the camera for one month, and on a trip to Italy, I returned it the place that I bought it. Many good things but, the digital cameras are too slow to react when you take/press the shutter. The zoom is slow, the LCD screen is often glared and the view finder is 75% of the image and skewed. Although quite impressive and versatile, change iso, color, hue and so on, I find the 35mm SLR to still be a much better camera for the same money. The digi-camera has a long way to go.

The picture quality I can get from this thing is remarkable. I have several cameras; including DSLR. I love taking pictures and do so quite often. I've used my C4000 for years and was quite happy with it, as an everyday camera. But it is rather bulky. So last year I decided I would replace it with a newer, slimmer and smaller camera that I could slip into my pocket. So I bought a Nikon coolpix. The only thing good about the coolpix was the size. The picture quality wasn't very impressive at all. The options were ok but nothing spectacular. But hey, it was a $120 camera. So no big deal. My coolpix died a few days ago at a semi-important event. I had originally planned to bring my DSLR but decided to use my coolpix for the event (an event that I needed pictures of for my website for my business). The coolpix was dead when I tried to start shooting. I bought it in December and this is July and it's dead. And I take very meticulous care of my camera equipment. So I drove home and grabbed my DSLR and everything was fine. Later that night, I got out my old C4000. I am now using it again as my daily shooter. It really is a great camera. The only thing that sucks is the size. I can't just pop it in my pocket when I'm not using it. Other than the size, this is a great camera. The cards are no longer made for it which means the ones that are still on the market are crazy expensive. So that sucks. But if you're looking for a great digital camera and you are on a tight budget, you can find these second hand for very few dollars.

With the Sony, I would have to color-balance nearly every photo in Photoshop to get a proper tonal range, but the Olympus automatically does everything for perfect images every time (even offering to show you the histograms as proof!). The range of settings available, as well as the flexibility of the menu system, makes this camera a pleasure to use. Even with extremely low-light conditions, using a fixed camera and subject, excellent images are possible, with up to 16-second exposure time! If I could change one thing it would be to add a more powerful optical zoom, and perhaps to include at least 32M of storage out of the box.

I have owned mine for about 2 months now and have learned enough to make an informed comment.The camera takes very sharp pictures, and most of the time the color is true.  I love the ability to manually adjust everything, and the ability to adjust flash levels has come in very handy for me.The main problem with this camera is big, but stupid.  It has a lens cap instead of a retractable lens.  That isnt the bad part.  The REALLY stupid part, is you HAVE to remove the lens cap before you turn on the camera, or the lens tries to extend, and it bangs into the cap which is attached to the body of the camera, not the lens.  All this technology and this was the solution for the lens cap?  I am still suprised that this is how the camera works.It is excellent that you have the ability to manually adjust everything, however it is a bit cumbersome until you get accustomed to it.  You cannot be adjusting and taking pictures \"on the fly\".  It is too hard to do that.  Set the camera for the best general setting you are in and keep shooting.  I had lots of problems taking pictures indoors of my one year old running around.  Every shot was blurred, even if she wasnt moving very much.  I had to change from \"point and shoot\" to manually setting the ISO to 400.  That fixed the blurring problem.  I now leave it at 400 for all general shooting.  It is nice that it has a button you can program settings into, so you can use a one button push to change to your prefered settings.  I havent used this option yet, but I know it will be helpful.The other big bonus for me on this camera was the ability to add lenses.  This may be why the lens isnt retractable.  I am going today to get some filters, and possibly a wide angle lens for it.  I looked at many cameras that didnt have this ability.  I am crossing my fingers that the lenses dont behave like the lens cap.  If they do, I will make another review probably somewhat different than this one.Bottom line for me, is that it is much better than my old Cannon 2MP camera.  The C-4000 could be a [better] camera, if they could have just worked out the lens and an easier menu.  I have grown accustomed to the lens problem and I dont even think twice about taking off the cap first.  The menus...well, I am still working on those.

She thought it's a lemon. It was just sitting on her cabinet collecting dust. I got this camera from my friend to try it out.Pros- Takes great pictures. Especially in low light. It out performed her pink Sony camera (forgot the model).- The flash is powerful- Awesome image quality. Colors are vivid and true to life (or close). Great for night or low light shots.- I love it's macro- Has different settings options- Relatively durable. I accidentally dropped it few times and didn't break on me and my friend was abusive with the camera and it still survived.Cons- Drains out batteries too fast. While you are trying to find out different settings you will run out of battery juice.- Heavy and bulky- Has major shutter lags and is slow to response (while eating up some more batteries)- Hard to focus sometimes, especially at full zoom in macro setting.- Occasionally produces barrel distortion- Uses SmartMedia Card which is now costly and discontinuedBottomline, it's a great cheap camera that takes good pictures at low light. However you have to invest on good battery recharger and batteries. Because it's so SLOW at responding and eats out batteries like no other camera I've used, it will require you to look else where for a camera.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1Q0EJEGHRB9UY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Super camera.  Excellent clarity of pictures on enlargement.  The Camedia 4000Z has many features that you would expect in a camera significantly more expensive. The Camedia software makes editing pictures easy!

The camera itself is great for beginers, even if it's a bit bulky. The quality of the pics is great! Alas, it saddens me to see the quality of this once great company deteriorate to the point that their products seize to work a few weeks/months after their warranty expires... Yes, there are lemons out there, but two cameras? What are the chanses of that? The first Olympus camera that failed on me was the C4000, when a week after the warranty expired the flash died on me. At least I got a good year more with that model (even if I was confined to day shots)... now, the 770 has totally died on me... it seems like the microchip/bar controlling the off-playback-auto-movie modes has malfunctioned on me as it is only turning off and into playback mode (even on camera/video mode)... no use sending it back to the factory as I don't have any warranty and y'all know how much they charge for repairs on digital cameras. So, if you do buy Olympus, get the extended warranty!Nothing left to use but upgrate... this time i'm getting the darn extended warranty... oh, and yes, I went for the Sony Alpha 100.... first dive into dSLR... can't wait to get the lenses this week to test it all out... more on that later.", "Date": "January 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not sure if I like yet!!!", "Author": "Julie Huffman", "ReviewID": "R9DL0OW6KHAC8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a hp720 camera that I exchanged for this olympus c 4000.The complaint i had with the hp was that it gave the red eye real bad.
