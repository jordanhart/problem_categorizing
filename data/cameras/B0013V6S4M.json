Krauss", "ReviewID": "R5KWQ7Y29OHNK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all, to use this you need a Control Center GE 45129 Choice-Alert Wireless Control Center.A few things to note that were not apparent until I bought this and a Control Center:  - the motion sensor can connect to the Control Center in two ways, either in one of the first three Zones (1, 2, 3) or in the fourth Zone (4) and the Control Center has a different behavior in these two categories.  - In Zone 1, 2, or 3: the motion sensor can only operate in Alarm mode, not in Monitoring mode.  Other sensors apparently can be setup to either Alert, Chime, or just show an indicator light for its assigned Zone based on a switch on the Control Center (the switch has settings of Alert / Chime / Off); this setting is applicable when the Control Center is disarmed (not in AWAY or HOME alarm mode).  But the Motion Sensor DOES NOT work in this way - it ONLY WORKS in AWAY or HOME alarm mode, when assigned to Zone 1, 2 or 3.  - When assigned to Zone 4: the motion sensor triggers an Alert only, which ignores the Alert / Chime / Off switch.  The Alert cannot be silenced, only muted once it starts.Since the alarm is overkill for what we want (monitoring our sleepwalking child), we plan on keeping it in Zone 4, and unplugging the Control Center without batteries in it to shut if off during the day.  The Alert itself should be sufficient to wake us up.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "slow to set off alarm", "Author": "C. Smith", "ReviewID": "R2D5TT8J9O2ZMW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this motion detector works really well at detecting any movement but then doesn't set off the alarm for about 30 seconds, all the while beeping as if to give an intruder directions to the home unit so he can destroy it before the alarm actually sounds. the time between activation of the motion detector and the alarm needs to be shortened.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Dependable", "Author": "Golf Man", "ReviewID": "R11NVYG01RI0QM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The motion sensor was not capable of transmitting a signal to the control center which was located only 60 feet away and only one exterior wall in its path.

Moss", "ReviewID": "R31Y7JTFTMIV0N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Be aware that this motion sensor suffers from several serious design flaws.  First, it is only active when the control center is set in the Away Mode not the Home Mode.  We have a two-story house.  We wanted to secure the first story while asleep in the second story bedroom.  Setting Home Mode is easy (one beep).  Setting Away Mode results in 45 seconds of loud, annoying beeping.  Not what we want to hear every night before bed.  The first night the system was active the motion sensor set off the alarm for no particular reason.  I turned the system off for the rest of the night.The next day I called GE Tech Support and was told the following:  1) The motion sensor is sensitive to heat/cold coming from registers in the floor (so I guess we should turn our furnace off?) 2) The motion sensor does not have a high/low sensitivity setting (despite the description on Amazon) 3) The remote control unit will still trigger 45 seconds of beeping when setting the Away Mode (so much for my theory of keeping the remote in the bedroom) 4) you cannot use more than one control center (well, there goes my theory of converting from 2 motion sensors to 15 door/window sensors plus garage plus flood sensors which would require 2 control centers).So, I am uninstalling the system, returning it to Amazon, and doing a much better job of research for my next security system.By the way my old system worked fine for 18 years until the system died from old age and the company that made it went out of business.  I'm so glad everything is made in China these days.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "You have to be kidding!", "Author": "Anne Brenner", "ReviewID": "R35SRTMC9UDEG3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this product, the base unit, a remote, and a supplementary alarm. This product did not work at all. To start out, the base unit would not let me program a new code. I programed zones 1 and 2 for the motion detectors and tried the alert and chime settings. They went off whether or not the unit was armed. After about an hour, neither the chime nor alert worked and could not be reprogramed.

After initiating communications between the sensors and the base unit I found two disturbing things.  First, they do NOT communicate up to 150 feet - I was lucky (after moving the base unit around a dozen times) to get about 35 feet with fresh batteries with nothing more than two drywall walls between them.  Not very useful and this forces you to put the base unit in potentially awkward places.  Second, as far as being weather-resistant?  I found that they stopped working when their temperatures dropped below 35 degrees.  So, unless you live in Florida, my observations indicate that these are not useful anywhere but in a nice, dry, warm environment.  I did find the construction of the sensors to be adequate.  But I must take issue with the base unit... it's cheaply built and does not function exactly like the manual states.  Further, YOU CANNOT USE THESE motion sensors in ANY mode except for \"Armed When You Leave The House Mode\"... so I have to question, what's the point then!  Final opinion:  not a well thought out product, cheap, doesn't work well, and well, you get what you pay for and I'm upset I wasted my time and money on these.

It can be the difference of 5 ft sometimes and only one room away from the control center if they work or not. Once you have them set, and working every time they stay working.
