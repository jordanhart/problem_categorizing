I needed a camera I could control via twain drivers from within a program I was developing, and this camera is perfect!  The twain driver works well and incorporating it into my application took just a few hours.  I've now bought a second one and these cameras are already an integral part of my company's security structure.  The leader in the small cam market, Logitech, abandoned twain and is now useless.  Digi's Watchport doesn't just fill that gap, it redefines the opportunity.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not good as a Webcam", "Author": "Anthony s.", "ReviewID": "RCVS0YXAU0HD0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Overpriced and not twain compatible as earlier versions were.
