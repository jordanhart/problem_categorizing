{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not perfect, but definitely worth 5 stars", "Author": "Billy", "ReviewID": "RI8A8Y2YPG7PN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just spent 2.5 weeks traveling Ireland with this camera so I've had plenty of time to get my hands dirty. I can honestly say this camera is amazing! It's small and lightweight but still packs a 30x zoom and takes great photo and excellent video. I see tons of reviews already with lots of detail so let me try to convey quickly my impressions of this camera after some hands on time.Ergonomics:Camera is just about perfectly sized and shaped in my book. A nice big hand grip on the right with a rubberized feel gives it a professional, well made feel and makes it easy to handle. The rest of the camera is kind of a brushed matte black which also gives it a very professional look. Handling for photos is great as well as it's large enough to make it easy to take two handed photos with the left hand balancing the front of the camera and lens ring and the right on the hand grip. This gives great control over the camera while snapping shots. The focus ring on the lens is a great for fine tuning your zoom to perfectly compose that distant subject. I was surprised how much I used the lens ring instead of the zoom in/out toggle next to the shutter.Display/Screen:Brilliant high resolution display so images, menus and video are all clear and crisp on screen. The screen itself seems pretty fragile so I'm considering adding a little protective cover to the screen. I have a hx9v as well and the screen is similar if not the same and my hx9v got a deep scratch in it from just a day of carrying in my pocket. The articulating feature is surprisingly useful. I didn't think I'd need or want this but the ability to hold the camera up high or down low and tilt the display so you can still view the camera is a handy feature.Video:top notch video, 1080p video with something like 60 frames per second, how can you beat it! Video is very clear and smooth with little to no artifacting or blurring. You can even snap still images (i think they're 3-5 MP) while taking your video. I don't think another camera in it's class can compete with this camera from a video standpoint. The AVCHD format is something I'm still learning to work with though and I find it's not the easiest to work with on a Mac. There don't seem to be many readily available video players for AVCHD and the way the movies are stored isn't the most straight forward way to facilitate browsing through your movies. Basically, things get stored in a not so simple folder structure and you have to know what you're looking for to find your movies. And like I said, then getting them to play, at least on a Mac, isn't so straight forward either. This could very well be a \"newbie\" thing from my standpoint and it's this format that allows the camera to take such brilliant high resolution video in the first place so I'm willing to deal with some learning curve/hassle here until AVCHD is more widely used.Photos:Photo quality is excellent when viewed at Large size or smaller and still very good at larger sizes. This is the only area where I wasn't floored by the performance of the camera. If you are looking for dSLR quality photos and/or are a big \"pixel peeper\" than this camera is not for you. Sony employs some pretty heavy noise reduction which results in noticeable artifacting when viewing images at full size. The hx100v allows from adjusting the level of noise reduction to \"-\" in the menus but even set to minus I found the NR heavier than I'd like. One of the downfalls to the megapixel race, unfortunately. Who needs 16 MPs crammed onto a tiny sensor like this? But that's a whole other discussion. The photo quality is still very good and more than satisfactory for me, especially with everything else the camera provides. Another feature of the Sony is the sweep panorama. This allows you to click the shutter and pan the camera across a landscape and the camera intelligently creates a panoramic photo in-camera. This is pretty remarkable and I used this a LOT on my trip! You have a few different size options from STD to WIDE to High Resolution. It's a lot of fun and provides for some very scenic photos that can range from a beautiful landscape to a \"fisheye\" still view of a crowd or a town. What's most incredible is how good the processing is at handling moving objects. I took panoramic photos of scenes with cars and people moving through the scene as I panned and it almost allows resolved them perfectly without any blurring or defects. I have noticed sometimes moving objects will be incorrectly \"spliced\" or solid lines such as lines on a basketball court or a fence or railing will be \"spliced\" a bit but this doesn't happen often and from research I've done this is more often the users inability to pan the camera smoothly than the camera processing something incorrectly.Conclusion: The bottom line for me with this camera is it is just plain fun to use. Great video, sweep panorama, a 30x zoom and good photo quality makes for a wonderful package. I am incredibly happy with this camera and have zero regrets about not having my dSLR with me on my trip. The 30x zoom gives you incredible range for capturing the perfect photo, the photo quality is good, if not very good, and only pixel peepers and those printing poster size prints will be unhappy with the results. The video and sound are best in class and the camera now handles SDHC cards so you're not bound to Sony memory sticks any more, although it can use those too. Anyone looking for a \"do it all\" camera that packs a huge zoom in a small body and takes great photo and video will love this camera.Surprise likes:Articulating screen is greatZoom/Focus ring on the lens is great for fine tuning your composition when zooming and also provides manual focusSweep panorama. I knew I'd like this feature but didn't realize how much.Annoyances/Gripes:AVCHD format for movies isn't the easiest to work withCamera not widely available yet (I had to have family pick it up from a best buy in South Carolina and bring it with them on the trip to get it)Screen seems very vulnerable to scratchingAbout me:This may help people understand my wants/needs in a camera. I'm an avid enthusiast/hobbyist. I love taking photos and I'm very tech savvy and very discerning about my tech purchases. I want a camera that provides as close to a \"do it all\" package as I can find. That means I need a large zoom range, good video and photos and it has to be portable if not pocketable. I share 99% of my photos over the web so crystal clear photos and super size prints aren't much of a need for me. I do like an occasional large print to hang on the wall but that's rare. I bought and returned a nikon s9100, a canon sx230, a sony hx9v all in the process of picking out my new camera for this trip. The hx100v blows them all away, although the hx9v is close.Hope this was a helpful review! Go get this camera and start having fun with it!", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amateur's Review of HX100V", "Author": "markose123 \"markose123\"", "ReviewID": "R32MR8KZRKE78B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Below are my thoughts on why I chose the HX100V:1) I need a new camera with video. I wondered about getting a DSLR but then found a bridge camera to be more covenant (as far as size), flexible (as far as features, especially the zoom range) and more affordable.2) I wanted a camera with tilt screen since I'll be taking angled pictures and video. This feature does make a difference for me.3) I hate Sony's exclusivity to only their memory card. This camera did not have this problem; I can use non-Sony memory cards.4) The 3-inch screen resolution on this camera was much greater than other bridge cameras. In my thinking, I'm using this screen all the time, so why not get the best resolution.5) I didn't care much for the RAW feature. I take pictures and don't do much editing afterwards.Now here are my thoughts after using the camera for one weekend, with the disclaimer that I'm not an ardent photographer. First, my positive thoughts so far:1) I love the zoom on this camera. Wow! With smart zoom and image stabilizer turned on, it can zoom up to 216x's. Granted the picture gets a bit fuzzy around 50-60x's but it's still recognizable. The zoom makes it feel like a camera that the FBI would use!2) The movie mode worked well. Clear to see on my TV and great sound. Again, the tilt screen-option helps tremendously.3) I love the background defocus feature. Awesome! The pictures look professional. You do have to keep the right distance in order for it to work. But even if it doesn't work, it'll still take a normal picture with a message letting you know that it didn't work. Make sure you follow the instruction on the screen that tells you how far away from the subject you need to be. As you zoom in further, the distance from the subject increases. It takes some practice.4) The size and weight are manageable. You can't fit it in your pocket, but at least you can carry it around all day without much hassle (plus you look like a better photographer since you have a bigger camera :)).5) I used the camera for most of the day on Saturday. Battery needed to be recharged at night. Granted, I did not use the GPS feature at all. But with normal use, the battery holds its charge.6) The smile detection feature is great! I turn on this feature and it automatically takes a shot when the subject smiles (the level of smile can be adjusted as well). This will especially be awesome for taking baby pictures. Plus, you can set up the timer on the camera to take a shot when one or two subjects are seen. It's great to take self portraits with my wife.7) Panoramic view is useful at times. It's easy to use once you try it a couple of times.8) Lower light shots are decent on this camera. It helps to set it to Superior Intelligent mode where it will take a few shots and combine them (note: file size is not much larger when doing this). The pictures are definitely brighter than my older cameras in low light. In addition, the back-light feature on Screen mode produces brighter pictures.Below are my negative thoughts (after only one weekend of using it):1) It's not a SLR camera. So don't expect SLR pictures. I've compared it to my old Sony point and shoot camera. The same pictures side-by-side shows some differences, but it's not major. The value of the HX100V is being able to tinker with setting to get a better picture (though I'm still learning this as I go). Plus, the intelligent mode does a better job in adjusting the settings. And most importantly, the zoom and extra features (defocus, smile detection, panoramic, video, etc.) sets it apart.2) The manual ring in the front was hardly used. I admit, this feature was very attractive before buying. But after using it, I'm more comfortable using the regular zoom. The manual focus feature seems less useful since the camera already does an awesome job of focusing automatically.Plus, if want to adjust the focus manually (when for instance shooting two subjects behind each other), I've found using the \"tracking focus\" easier. To do this, push the middle \"control button\", which will pull up a box where you place the object to focus on. Then push the middle button again and it locks this object in focus. Furthermore, you can use the dedicated \"focus\" button on the camera to do some manual focusing as well.So in essence the manual focus ring is not as responsive when compared to SLR cameras, since it's electronic. But with other options available, it's not as a big deal.3) I wish the \"custom\" button on the camera would have more options. For me, it would have been great to program the \"defocus\" feature to this button. This way I can activate it with a push of a button instead of going to Screen mode and choosing it, or the MR mode.4) It's very easy to leave your fingerprints on the screen. I'd probably have to do some research on finding some protective sticky that won't leave fingerprint marks (if it even exists).5) The lag time when I move the \"mode dial ring\" is a bit slower since it also shows which mode I'm moving it to on the screen. I don't see why the 3-inch screen shows these changes since I'm already looking at the dial. Plus, I don't think there's a way to de-activate the screen showing this info.It's a small complaint since I have to wait for the screen to go \"live\". But I did find that you can start taking the next picture while the review screen is coming up.6) I don't see myself using the 3D feature since I don't plan to get a 3D TV. Plus, unless someone can give a great reason to use the GPS on this camera, I don't see it being used much. The cost of battery life seems to overweight its benefits. But, GPS may come in handy if I'm on a traveling tour and I buy an extra battery.7) The file sizes of the pictures are around 5MB when it's set on the 16MP mode. I shot the same picture with 16MP and 5MP (the 5MP picture makes the file size around 2MB). I couldn't see any major differences in these two pictures side-by-side. Since the maximum size I'll print these pictures will probably be 8x10, I'll be keeping the camera on the 5MP mode. Plus, this mode gives greater zoom than 16MP (with smart zoom turned on).8) The video file sizes are large. A few seconds of video takes around 20-30MB's. So I'm thinking I'll keep the video mode lower (and not in the maximum-HD option) since I plan to burn my videos to DVD for storage. Even in these lower modes, the videos are still great.These are my overall thoughts so far. I hope you find it useful in making your decision. And thank you again for all those who have posted before me on this camera.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good camera.  Not all features well documented.", "Author": "Arthur Black", "ReviewID": "R1SCZED6VMEJLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the years I have owned different 35 mm SLR cameras plus early model digital cameras.  I purchased the DSC-HX100v about a month ago.  Prior to that, I owned the previous Sony model, the DSC-HX1.  I tend to judge digital cameras by how closely they can mimic the speed and ease of shooting of a traditional SLR.  And with the expectation that they will also offer new smart features.In this review I'll try to touch on a few of my likes, and one concern now resolved for the DSC-HX100vOverall I would say the DSC-HX100v is a nice upgrade from the DSC-HX1, which I also considered a good camera.Face detection:  These days I take a lot of family pictures.  I very much like the face detection feature of the camera.  The camera can detect several faces in a scene, and then balance lighting across all.  A rather complex function to do with a traditional SLR.Built in GPS:  I like the built in GPS.  I use Adobe Photoshop Elements to organize my photos.  That software can read the GPS information on each photo.  It will show the location of photos on a map.  Or will show all pictures taken near a specific location.  This makes it useful to record GPS data on all photos.  With the DSC-HX1, I had used an external Sony GPS, the GPS-CS3KA to track my route, then mark location on the pictures.  That worked well.  But you had to be careful to ensure that the clock of both units were correctly set.  It was easy when traveling to make a setting error on either the GPS or camera when you changed to a new time zone.  With the clocks out of sync, the GPS would have trouble matching your travel locations to the photos.  The clock sync problem is now resolved with the built in GPS.  In the limited testing I've done, the sensitivity of the built in GPS seems acceptable.  It seems comparable to the external hand held GPS-CS3KA.Viewfinder / display screen coordination:  Due to my SLR background, I have a strong preference for composing pictures using the viewfinder rather than the large format screen.  The Sony viewfinder image resolution is good.  Time lag is minimal.  One nice touch on this new model.  The camera has a mode that will turn off the large screen, and turn on the viewfinder when you hold the camera up to your eye.  The camera has a sensor next to the viewfinder.  When you move the camera away from your eye, the large format screen turns on again.  A nice bit of human engineering.Video plus pics:  The video on the DSC-HX1 was good.  But video on the new camera is much better.  Full HD 1080.  A nice touch with the new camera is that you can simultaneous take still pictures while recording video.  The camera has two separate shutter buttons, one for video and one for photos.  You can start recording video, then press the photo shutter when you would also like to simultaneously capture a still photo.  With the DSC-HX1, if I wanted to take a still photo, I first had to stop recording video.Lag between pictures:  A basic criteria I use for judging camera performance is how quickly I can compose and shoot a sequence of pictures.  The default on the DSC-HX1 was to display the picture after shooting.  Before the view finder would became live again, you had to wait for the displayed picture to time out.  This created a time lag between pictures.  But there was a work around on the DSX-HX1.  It  had a menu option that allowed you to turn off the photo \"display after shooting\" function.  This allowed you to compose and shoot pictures in fairly rapid sequence.  Approaching the speed of a traditional SLR.  Sony eliminated this menu option with the new camera.  The new camera defaults to forcing you to look at each resulting picture for a fixed time period after shooting.The good news is that there is an undocumented solution to this problem.  (Thanks to another reviewer for pointing this out to me.)  After taking the picture, during the \"display after shooting\" period, you can over ride the display time by pressing the shutter button half way down.  When you do this, the camera returns to the live view mode almost immediately.  I did not find this feature documented in the manual.  And neither the Sony chat line person nor the Sony Style store clerk I dealt with was able to offer a solution.  But the feature is built into the camera.  It now actually works better than the HX1 since you can set the camera to display all pictures, but then quickly stop the display on a shot by shot basis if you are in a hurry to take the next picture.  Very nice.Delay between pictures when using the half-press of the shutter is minimal. I did one quick test and was able to shoot 10 pictures in 30 sec, or one picture per three sec. This included doing a brief pause, perhaps a second, each time the viewfinder became live to simulate framing each new picture before shooting it.  If you wanted to shoot faster than this, you would have the option of using the burst modes.Documentation:  Sony provides a CD with the camera that contains a pdf copy of the intro manual.  And an html version of the full manual.  The html only format makes it very difficult to print out the full manual.  The search ability of the html manual is also limited.  I really wish they would provide the full manual in pdf format.  It's a bit silly to force me to lug along a laptop if I want to check the full manual.  They do have an abbreviated version of the manual built into the camera.Conclusion:  Some challenges with the documentation.  But an excellent camera.  Based on the tip from the other reviewer, I've changed my rating from four stars to five stars.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returned it for a DSLR - now I'm happy", "Author": "Keith in Dallas \"K\"", "ReviewID": "R3INK2NRB4CPXI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "OK,My quest for the perfect camera began 1 year ago. I had a simple Canon SD750, which I thought was a good digital camera. I didn't know anything about DSLRs or super zooms - I thought those big cameras were 35mm. Anyway, I was at party where someone had a Panasonic FZ28. I really liked it. I didn't know there were cameras that had such high zoom. And so my camera education began....After A LOT of research, I bought a Panasonic FZ35. I had this camera for 10 months. It took razor sharp pictures in daylight, the zoom was fun, but it lacked low light performance. After much more research, it appeared that the Sony HX100V had great low light performance, so I decided to sell my FZ35 for the HX100V. I justified the $$, and bought it. Here is what I liked and disliked....Likes: The camera is solid, has great features, great picture quality with sunlight, good high ISO up to about 800, SD card compatible, great zoom, good portrait low light pictures, great burst shooting, excellent video.Dislikes: SLOW shot to shot times, SLOW start up, SLOW zoom, poor low light action shooting (burst - no flash), slow movie starting. I ended up missing many photo opportunities while waiting for the camera to write the last set of pictures to the card. The slowness of even changing modes was very frustrating. This is my biggest complaint, and I even tried to rectify it and purchased a Scandisk Extreme Pro. The camera was quicker, but not quick enough for me. As for picture quality - indoor portraits with flash - very good. Outdoors - good, although my FZ35 was sharper outdoors (sucked indoors).What I have come to realize is that there is no perfect camera for everyone, you must first define your priorities and make sacrifices. In the beginning of my quest for the perfect camera, I ranked cost and portability as my number (1) priority, followed by HD video, and than features. After almost a year of shooting with the FZ35, and 2 months with the HX100V, I realized that most of the pictures I am taking are of my son's TaeKwonDo tournaments. The FZ35 could not handle the indoor lighting, and the video was average. The HX100V did better if shooting with flash or using video, but not so good trying to capture action shots indoors (burst mode). I tried using it at a tournament, but ended up having to use video (which turned out great). The shutter lag and low shutter speeds needed caused missed shots or blurry pictures. I tried using it at an airshow, but the tracking focus had trouble keeping up even in good light. I tried using it to take pictures at a birthday party at an indoor roller skating rink - useless, I put it back in the car. I was left wanting more.I determined that my priorities had changed to indoor action picture quality as number (1), with portability and video not as important anymore (as I rarely used the video on the HX100V, and I was already carrying a bag to hold the camera stuff). I decided to try a DSLR, and ordered the Pentax K-R.I am a lot happier with the DSLR as it's low light action shot is amazing, gorgeous portraits, start up and shot to shot times are speedy. Yes, it cost me more money, but the picture quality is worth it for me. No, it's not as portable, but it is the smallest DSLR and lenses are cheap for this camera. It isn't much bigger than the Sony HX100V.So, if you've gotten this far in my review, please know your camera  priorities first so you don't end up going through what I did.This is a great camera if your priorities are:- portraits (indoor or outdoor)- outdoor (action, stills, wildlife)- HD movie makingThis is not a camera for:- Indoor action- fast moving subjects (such as an F/A18 going 700 mph)- needing to change settings quicklyI thought I would miss the zoom, but my 300mm lens gets me almost as close. Cropping the picture gives almost as good picture quality as the HX100V did without cropping. Now I understand all the fuss around larger sensor cameras (DSLRs). It makes a HUGE difference.If you pan on taking pictures of landscapes, indoor stills, outdoor anything, movies, than this camera will do it beautifully. If you have kids with a lot of indoor sport activities - you'll need a DSLR, unless you are just making a video. Hope this helps. :)", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R3FYK4FXIZ3SF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just a quick review...I've had the camera for 3 days now, and I'm really enjoying using it for just about everything.The zoom/focus on this is very impressive.  30x optical zoom, and then after taking the picture, you can even zoom in an additional 8x on the image itself (from the camera).  The image stays crisp, even when zoomed in as far as it goes.The 3D is a nice touch, but since there is no 3D screen on the camera itself, you can only view your 3D images/panoramas by connecting the camera via HDMI to a 3D-ready television/monitor.  The 3D is extremely nice though, when it is hooked up to a TV.After a little configuration, you can get the camera setup to essentially run how you want, all the time with minimal changes being done.I'm using a 16GB Class-10 SD-card, and there is very little processing time, even after recording 3D panorama.On the body of the camera itself, there are small raised areas that are slightly textured.  These areas make the camera extremely easy to grip, and you almost have to try to drop this thing.  The camera is a decent physical size, so don't be afraid of crushing it if you have big hands (like those tiny point and shoot cameras).You can also adjust the LCD screen, so you can angle the camera without having to worry about not being able to see, or turn yourself into a strange position.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent for Video and decent for Still shots", "Author": "G.

It's pretty obvious even after one day, how superior it is to any other camera in this sensor size class.  I am posting this review here because the camera is not even showing up in my searches on Amazon.ca...Firstly, the videos are amazingly smooth at 60 frames per second PROGRESSIVE (or 60p; not interlaced like some competitors) at full HD (1920x1080).  I have tried panning quickly (quicker than one would normally pan if one doesn't want to tire the eyes of the audience) and filming cars - both of which produced no choppiness as it did with the Canon PowerShot SX220 HS (which I returned due to its choppy videos at only 24p).  I have tried low-light photos indoors with tungsten or halogen lighting and at night with just the street lights and car headlights and both come out quite beautiful with a minimal of graininess.  This graininess is actually only evident if you enlarge the photo to full size or more than, I estimate, a 21x28 inch print size.  And these would have to be taken with 1600 ISO or 3200 ISO in order to be \"bothered\" by the grain.  When I view the photos on my 24 inch wide-screen Samsung monitor and also on my 40 inch Sony LCD HDTV and they look formidably sharp and beautifully exposed, with good colours and pixel sharpness/definition.I would like to point out that I am a former owner of a DSLR - the Canon EOS 50D, which I sold, to change my photo habits for a more affordable camera which could also do excellent full HD videos.  I have also done SLR photography as an amateur since 1981 and even took some photography courses in a degree program, so I'm quite familiar with camera features and how to take photos.  This Sony HX100V hits the spot RIGHT ON!  It has an astounding lens range from 27mm - 810mm at 4:3 photo format and today, I took a video of some pigeons grazing on a field at maximum zoom, hand held and they were as sharp as at any other lens zoom setting, and with very little camera shake and this is amazing for me!The GPS is also pretty good at picking up signals.  It had problems when I was in the balcony of my solid concrete and brick apartment (9 floors) which has other high buildings around it and a high-voltage hydro transformer next to it, but after walking about 100 feet to the other side of my building on the sidewalk of my street, the GPS picked up the signal faultlessly and kept it.The flash is also quite versatile.  It has a \"slow synchro\" setting which makes the background and the subject much more natural-looking and more evenly illuminated compared to the normal direct flash setting.This camera is a wonder because you have control over everything and can adjust anything from white-balance, to exposure during videos, to flash exposure compensation, manual (user controlled) focus point selection and even manual focus!The camera's auto-focus is very good and can track subjects really quickly.  It is probably best to use the multi-focus setting if you are filming in busy places with lots of people or other subjects (like team sports) and you have the option of even selecting your own focus point.The menus are also intuitive and quite easy to navigate and even have a built-in \"help\" feature right in the camera menus themselves, whereby, when you press the button on the lower right of the LCD screen with the \" delete / ? \"  symbol, you can check some basic instructions on many features.The LCD screen is at the same high-quality resolution as most DSLRs and as my old Canon 50D - at 921,000 pixels!  It was bright and very sharp, making photo composition very easy.  The electronic viewfinder is also very easy to use and sharp enough to use comfortably.  The viewfinder also has a dioptric adjustment so that you can vary its focus/sharpness according to your eyes, adding yet another feature to this camera from the higher-end DSLRs, which again delighted me!  However, Sony could consider having a fully reversable (180 degree) LCD screen which one can flip to face you when taking self-portraits or when not behind the camera.  This feature would help save time in composing your shots.The ergonomic fit of the camera in my hand was also perfect with that right-handed protrusion serving as a grip, making me miss my old DSLR even LESS!  In fact, I don't miss my Canon 50D at all with this amazing HX100Vs quality and versatility and perhaps most importantly, the amount of control it gives the photographer over changing settings and consequently, over his/her photos.The only gripe I have is a gripe that many people probably already have is that the instructions are not printable in one shot.  You have to literally navigate to each page you want to print and print them.  Though this can be adapted to in a way, since we can then only print the pages and sections we need, while leaving out the obvious and basic sections which we already know about.  But still, a PDF Acrobat format instruction manual is definitely called for.This camera puts all the cameras in its class to shame since it does things which no others can do yet - 60p video combined with an optical amazing zoom range (I have not even tested the digital zoom yet which would magnify even more), an intelligent and quick auto-focus, flash and overall excellent picture and video quality and all this, while still giving full manual control over all the settings that even professional photographers would be impressed with and many thought would only be found on higher-end cameras.Way to go Sony!

If you're expecting the same quality as a $1,000 camera then look elsewhere - if you're looking for a camera that stands at the top of the list for bridge cameras then you have found your camera. I would suspect that prints up to 10x8 would be fine - small prints of 4x6: I doubt there would be loss in quality compared to most $1,000 cameras. I sold my Sony A55 so I could have a bridge camera that came all in one package. By the way, the review above this with 1* - the person obviously has no idea how to rate a product if he hasn't even tested out the camera yet and is giving it a low rating because there was no battery charger - just do what I did: go on e-bay and buy one for $5.00. The two ratings above this with 5* ratings (IMO) are very accurate.Edit: a week later - first, the person who only gave it one star because there was no battery charger has pulled their review (as they should have). This camera comes under the heading of a P&S; - but it is so close to a DSLR that the only thing missing is a better quality sensor (Xbut then that is why this is a sub-$400 camera and a good DSLR with a decent lens is $1,000 (and more).  The video on this camera is clear and bright and HD quality - you don't get a photo camera because it has great video - but I guarantee you could not tell the difference in video quality between this camera and a top-of-the-line video camera. Not all photos I have taken would be considered great but there are some good ones - that is for sure. I am still learning what works best (so many different controls and settings) - but the bottom line is you won't be sorry (in fact, you'll be thrilled) that you purchased this camera (because it is in short supply some people are paying over $500 on E-bay)!", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value And Feature-Set", "Author": "A. A. Katz", "ReviewID": "R1I2ZIF5DXBU83", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was skeptical about this camera from the get-go. 16 million pixels in a 1/2.3\" sensor is just a depressing thought. Even though this has the Exmor rear-illuminated sensor (which is supposed to deliver more light to each pixel), 16 million pixels on a tiny, tiny sensor is just an insurmountable challenge in terms of noise.I was sorely disappointed with my first shots and considered returning the camera. As always, even at the lowest (-) settings, Sony applies heavy-handed noise reduction and sharpening. At 100% (pixel-peeping), there were sharpening artifacts on many edges and yet the pictures didn't look all that sharp at normal viewing resolution.So I took the camera to the local botanical gardens to give it a good test compared to my more professional kit (I also shoot with a Nikon D7000 and a bag full of lenses). Just like my reaction to the early H-series cameras, I was amazed at the quality and detail and sharpness of these nature shots, some of which were quite difficult (red flowers, for example). They post-processed well in Photoshop CS5, and I printed as large as 9X12 and showed them at an outdoor exhibit and sale - where they were much admired and sold well.I decided to keep the camera. The more photos I take with it, the more fun I have and the more I have come to respect it. I just stopped pixel-peeping and got happy!As for low light, this is not a very effective low-light camera. Like all of its predecessors, anything over ISO 400 shows either noise or heavy noise-reduction. Usable, but not particularly good (I'm spoiled by the Nikon D7000, which is excellent at higher ISOs). On the other hand, the hand-held twilight mode can produce some really remarkable results in low light.What can I say about the video? It's world-class. In fact, I decided not to buy a relatively expensive separate camcorder after viewing video I took on this camera. I don't use the highest resolution (though it's nice to have it), because I burn my videos to standard DVDs, which don't support 1080i. So, I use the 720p, which looks gorgeous, rich and clean on my 52\" LCD TV, even from a DVD (as opposed to direct-connect through the Hx100's HDMI cable).Pros:Brilliant, well-exposed, saturated shots with beautiful dense and accurate colors.Incomparable zoom range with incredible accuracy and sharpness thanks to the Carl Zeiss design.Fast focus, fast shooting, big buffer.Takes SD cards!Battery life is excellent. To date, I have never run a battery completely out.Video is nothing less than superb.Flash is not only excellent, but it color-balances to the original non-flash image, meaning your flash shots look natural instead of cold and overlit.Panorama is positively amazing.Price is excellent compared to the rich feature set.Cons:Long zoom means that, at telephoto, minimum focus range is 8 feet.Heavy-handed noise reduction and sharpening. They should offer RAW on this camera series.They should let you turn off AutoReview for faster shooting.iAuto is not as \"intelligent\" as it should be. I got a fair share of under-exposed, over-exposed and blurry shots in that mode. Aperture-Priority and Manual modes are excellent.Conclusion: If you want a camera with huge capabilities that lets you concentrate on your subjects instead of the camera, this camera should be at the top of your list. If nothing else, it's huge fun to use!", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony HX100 is a winner", "Author": "David L.

I also own a Canon T1i, XSI and the former owner of a Sony A200 and Olympus Evolt all SLR's (Just as a reference to my familiarity with good IQ). The Sony is a great bridge/superzoom.

I loved the quality of the Canon pictures - colors and clarity were always good.  The camera had some very nice features:  1) the 12.1 MP was great.  I frequently crop my pictures and print zoomed up portions not just the original shot. 2) There were enough scene modes to allow for creativity without a lot of fuss. 3) It was bigger than a typical P&S;, but still small and lightweight.  But --- there were a few things that it lacked.  1) The 6x optical zoom was nice, but not very powerful.  2) Burst mode and action shooting wasn't the greatest.  3) Night shots were good with a tripod, but often blurry without one.  4) It had 1080p videos, but once you started recording, you couldn't zoom in or out.I Take lots of vacation photos.  I often blow them up to print 8x10 up to 13x19.  I scrapbook, and splice videos and images into pretty complex slideshows.  We watch them on a 35 inch high def tv, so want the images to increase without loss of clarity.I've read lots of users reviews, and think they're really helpful to hone in on the pros/cons that I was most interested in, so I thought I'd return the favor and share my experiences looking for a high end point and shoot camera.I looked at four cameras, but ultimately chose to keep the Sony HX100.What did I look at?Fuji FinePix F550EXR.  Brand new 16MP ultra-compact point & shoot.  Took great indoor and outdoor pictures; loved the panorama feature and thought the GPS could be handy.  Didn't like the flash popping up constantly under my left thumb; and the startup on the camera was very inconsistent - from 3 secs up to 15 secs to be ready to shoot (with the GPS featured disabled).  I knew the slow start up would cost me shots in the future and I was a little nervous about keeping steady with such a tiny camera, so I sent it back.Panasonic Lumix DMC-F35.  A step down in megapixels from my canon, but if the picture quality was great, I could live with that.  Had a bigger zoom, so I figured that would compensate the Megapixels and still allow me to crop as I like to do.  The camera was classified as a \"bridge\", so it was much bigger than both the Fuji and my current Canon.  What did I like about this one?  The outdoor shots were phenomenal.  Took some really good shots of birds outside that would have been specs on my old camera.  I found I didn't mind the compromise in size, and actually liked having some of the heft of an old SLR back, as it made zoomed shots easier to keep steady.  But, the indoor shots were terrible.  Grainy, grainy, grainy!  What's up with that?  How could this camera be so good outdoors (macro flower shots were awesome) but worse than a little point and shoot indoors?  Unfortunately, back to the drawing board.Next I tried the new Panasonic Lumix DMC-G3.  This one was a 16 MP micro 4/3s camera.  Interchangeable lenses, which I wasn't sure I wanted to lug around with me on vacations, but image quality again was rated very high.  Finally got one in - and I found I couldn't take a decent clear picture out of the box.  This camera has a new combination touchscreen and traditional dial interface, including the ability to focus by touching the screen.  I thought it would be fairly straightforward( I'm a veteran computer, smartphone and Ipad user - how tough could it be?) But it was not intuitive.  Needing to be up and confident in shooting with this camera for an imminent overseas vacation, I decided I didn't want to take the chance on trying to learn it at the expense of some once-in-a-lifetime shots.  Might be a great camera, but not for me.  I know I want to spend more time enjoying my vacation than composing the shot to remember it...strike 3.I picked up the Sony HX100V.  It had all the features I was looking for, including a prety unbelievable up to 810mm zoom (35 mil equivalent).  That would have required a lift just to hold up on my old Pentax SLR!  I picked it up an started clicking away on IAuto.  But I like to use the other features too, so I tried using a slow shutter speed and shot a nearby waterfall at dusk (high dynamic ratio).  Wow.  I was pretty impressed.  The handheld twilight mode took some really nice buildings lit up at night, and the zoom did even better than the Panasonic for catching some local wildlife. (It's probably got a fair amount to do with the Carl Zeiss lens, which I've had on prior cameras and really liked the optics.)  At first I thought the pictures looked a bit washed out; but a side by side comparison of the same shots taken with my Canon actually showed that the Sony color and contract were better!  (That's why we take pictures, isn't it?  Because what we remember sometimes isn't as close to reality as we thought???)  The speed of the camera is impressive - starts quickly, focuses quickly.  Another thing I really like - the automatic switch between the screen and the electronic view finder.  I found on some bird pictures, I lost the bird when trying to use the screen, and wanted to switch to the viewfinder.  On the Panasonic, I had to hit a button to do that, which meant I moved the camera and lost my subject.  On the Sony, I can just move the camera up to my eye and it automatically switches to the EVF - Sweet!  Took a few videos as well - great clarity, very good sound, and it was a nice add on that I could zoom while shooting.I really like the features on this camera.  As I said, I'm heading out shortly on vacation, and want to take some cityscapes with the panorama feature.  I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with the options on this camera, without flipping through the 275 page maual to find out how to do something.  It's not as brag-worthy as carrying a Leica or a thousand dollar slr, but it takes great pictures that I'll enjoy printing to frame in my house, show as slideshows to the family, and burn to watch videos on our Playstation 3.If you're looking for a really feature-packed bridge camera, that also doesn't give up on image quality in favor of the gadgets, I'd recommend this Sony.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "sony hx 100v vs canonsx30is and nikon p500", "Author": "jim jim", "ReviewID": "R1Z8PKR7T9070L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "bought p500 and canon sx30is at the same time i compared both and i took the p500 back, the battery life was too short and the pictures wasn't as good as the canon,3 other people told me the same. i also didn't like the way the p 500 would focus when u zoomed all the way out it bounced all around. took p500 back and bought sony hx100v to compare to the canon, they are close, the pictures from the canon were not as crisp, with purple fringing on photos and the lcd screen is not nearly as nice as the sony. i liked the color on the canon photos in auto mode a little better,the sony is a little red, but if you go into a different mode you can change the setting to real. i took hundreds of photos with all three of these cameras and my scores for each are:  sony 90 out of 100  canon sx30 is 84 out of 100 (didn't like lcd) nikon p500 75 out of 100 .  sony wins out because of lcd and picture crispness.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "No software for Mac or Windows XP-64 bit Edition!", "Author": "C.

However, I have one warning that was not pointed out by the other reviewers. The PMB software that comes with the camera does not work on the Mac. There is a \"light\" version of this software for the Mac, but it only handles the basic import and display of pictures, it does not handle video or 3D pictures at all. I had a second  computer that runs Windows XP-64 bit and ... the PMB software does not work on that operating software either! Fortunately my laptop runs on Windows XP (32 bit) and that did run the PMB program. This was not an ideal solution for me, I didn't want to use my laptop to store my pictures.

Michaels", "ReviewID": "R2T2UYJD5JPGUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got back from a two-week trip in Europe with my new Sony DSC-HX100V Camera and wanted to add my feedback to help others and thank everyone who helped me choose this camera. In summary, this is a fantastic camera and was a pleasure to use. It is a large step up from my older version from Sony. I took more than 4,000 photographs in two weeks. and put the camera through about every test that it could have.In more detail, here are the key aspects and my two cents on them.Overall Camera Performance: This camera is a work horse and had many features that made it a dream to work with and a couple that are major issues in my opinion (which I will cover later). I used the Superior Auto automatic feature almost exclusively with the hand dial located near the shutter release I quickly tweaked the EV levels when necessary. It also does this for you automatically by taking three bracketed photographs. I chose to have the instant control which worked very well for me. The battery life was very good. I had three batteries which lasted longer than I anticipated. I would charge them daily which more than met my needs. Only once did I run out of batteries and used my new Sony DSC-H70 at that time. I actually switched between cameras depending if I needed a really wide angle or wanted to be less obvious.Picture Quality: Picture quality was outstanding even at the longer focus distances. What an incredible range of framing options with the 30x Zoom. In many cases, since I was shooting at the highest 16M size I simply made minor edits in the camera after the shot. I was totally amazed at the picture quality at all ranges day and night. Even though I took a monopod, I never used it. All photographs were either hand held or I found a natural tripod at night to add some minor stability. I was more than impressed with the picture quality and so were the people I was traveling with.Ease of Use: This is a very easy camera to use. Most things are well placed and there are great features. It is lightweight, very user-friendly and was a joy to use. The weight is well distributed and makes it an easy camera to keep with you at all times. I just enjoyed using this camera and it just got easier.Two Major Flaws: Again, this is my opinion, but I found two flaws in the camera design that impacted my work with the camera. First and most important, this camera will allow you to delete an entire days worth of photographs without asking you if you are sure you want to do this. Click and they are gone! Paris at night...gone. I went back out until 5:00 a.m. to re-shoot. Before the trip, my son deleted some photographs and I was furious - not at him but that it could have happened. And then I did it. I was tired and looking at photographs and deleting some and then a day's worth were gone. This is a huge flaw and I would by no means let it stop you from getting the camera. I ended up manually protecting all of my photographs before I would look at them. Just be careful. Second, is that I kept turning on the movie function which is a small button located in the wrong place for me apparently! I missed a few shots stopping the movie.Very Highly Recommended: I would highly recommend this camera. This trip and this camera were both dreams come true for me. Watch the delete button and you should be very happy. I have added some photographs to the page to show the level of detail and performance in some of the most challenging shots.Two Months Later: I am very happy with this camera. I had some 11x14 prints made and they are amazing quality. I will try larger soon. I did notice some purple showing up in small details with extremely bright sunlight but it is very rare.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "After buying 4 camera's from 4 different manufacturers I found this beauty!", "Author": "The Walkers \"Mother of 3\"", "ReviewID": "R2TD1H7S77XRFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went through camera H3LL before buying this camera. I started with an Olympus, then Cannon, then Nikon, and each one I knew within 10min - 24hours they were going back. I really hated the Olympus - not the same as it used to be.. picture quality was the worst of all 4. The Cannon was already giving me problems with not turning on after a few hours (went though the same thing with my Cannon camera two years ago), and then there was the Nikon. I really wanted to like the Nikon, I mean it was my favorite appearance wise (went with red) but the picture quality was just bad. The Cannon took better photos! So I finally bought this camera, and within 12 hours I knew I was no parting with this camera for anything!You should know - I am not a professional photographer in any form. I use my camera mainly to take pictures of my kids. This is important because kids are not the easiest subjects to get.. they are constantly moving and you have to have a camera that takes multiple shots in a row at high speeds otherwise you will never get a photo of a smile :)I love -1. The looks - it looks awesome. I pull it out and people always say \"wow, that's a nice camera\"2. The form of the camera. All the right indention, grips, and such to make holding it easy on the hands.3. I love the ability to move the screen up, down, and extent in and out. When my kids are down low I just move the screen facing up to me and lower my arms, no getting down on the ground.4. I love the photo edit options built in such as red eye reduction. Very few camera's have this now days and of all the ones I have used Sony is by far the best.5. I have never had a camera do this... it is fantastic.... but you can take a regular photo and then have the camera zoom in and crop out all area you zoomed out of the frame. This is fantastic because it does not affect the pixels. If I did this on my computer it would lessen the pixels and prevent me from blowing the photo up to larger formats.6. Any edit you make to a photo is saved, but also the original is saved as well. So if you see the photo on your computer and do not like the edit then you still have the original.7. The zoom... yea enough said there! WOW 30X and they mean it.8. The zoom is fast in and out but not insane fast. This is important I learned from owning the Nikon. It would zoom so dang fast that I would loose my object immediately. I would spend another minute lightly tapping the zoom back out to find the subject and then tap tap tap tap tap zoom back in to get the photo withe my subject in it. FREAKING ANNOYING!9. The auto intelligent photo really works! Out of all 4 cameras the only auto intelligent photo that worked was the Cannon. The Sony by far has a much better working intelligent photo though and even a super auto intelligent photo option. I like both but the super one takes a while in between photos since it is actually editing and fine tuning your photo after it takes it.10. The pixels are perfect. They are clear and accurate in color and tones.11. The HD video is great. It is fast, clear, and the sound is good.12. Panoramic shots are superb and print out perfect.13. 3D option is super cool but I have not used it.14. The face detection is always spot on... I mean it never gets it wrong.15. The background de-focus is AMAZING! I love this feature!16. I very rarely get blurred photos. Even when the kids are riding bikes are playing around the photos still come out clear. I did not have this with any of the other camera's I went through.17. The smile shutter is great and works perfectly! You can even adjust it to the size smile from grin to big teeth showing smile. I captures the photo perfectly every time.18. Face softening feature is nice but honestly I do not use it very often.19. Anti blink feature really works - I had two cameras that boasted about this feature and it did not work. With this camera.. it works and works perfectly. I even tried it would several faces together and not one closed eye in any of the photos!20. Transfer jet is an incredible feature but I do not have anything to try it on yet.21. I love how you can either zoom with the zoom button on top of the camera or you can zoom with twisting your hand around the actual lens..22. All of the buttons are perfectly placed.23. The continues shooting mode is really nice and you get like 10 photos in the blink of an eye.24. I hate not having the view finder but this camera surpasses that! It is electronic and has everything the big screen has.25. HUGE screen. I love the big screen...26. The time that laps between photos is the shorted of all the camera's I tried. It was really fast, I am talking like 4.5 seconds between snapping a photo and being able to snap another... I just timed it myself to be 100% accurate. Now this is using (yes this is very important) a SanDisk SDHC Card #4. Those who are complaining about slow shutter speed are most likely using a cheap class level 2 card or off brand card (I SAID MOST SO DON'T GO ALL CRAZY IF YOU THINK THE SPEED IS SLOW AND YOU HAVE A HIGH PERFORMANCE CARD!)When I used my friends class level 10 SDXC card and OMGosh... the shutter speed was like 2 seconds or something! Crazy speed but expensive SD Card! For those who want to learn more about SC card classification just Google it... there is tons of info on the web.27. My husband loves the GPS feature but I have not used it and don't plan on it being that I do not want anyone having info of my kids whereabouts... overprotective like that... or so I have been told :). My husband uses it to take shot of his kill when he is out hunting, x marks the spot I guess.. I dunno? LOL28. The battery last a long time to me... I take on average 200-400 photos before I recharge it. Another plus is that the battery is a Sony common one, meaning all of our Sony products (camcorder, camera) both have the same batteries so that is helpful when it comes to charging them and buying an added external charger which I feel was a must.29. Great low light photos. I have tons of the kids asleep looking like angels and they all have come out clear and there was no blur or darkening of the pictures.The Cons -1. It is heavy after a while holding it with one hand while getting the kids to act right for the shot.2. I hate that it pops off the lens cover but I fixed this by tying the lens cover tether to the actual carry strap to the camera. So now I just turn it on and let it pop the cover off itself. It just hangs there until I power the camera down and put it back on.3. This is stupid to complain about but I am being totally honest here... I do not like how previewing photos with the camera off is set up. If you press the play button to JUST preview your photos on the screen, (not turn the camera on) everything works great and goes as it should BUT if you use logic and press the play button again to turn the preview off it actually turns the camera on! The way to turn off the preview without turning the camera on (this is so stupid to me) is by literally pressing the power button for the camera. That turns off the photo preview and does not power up the actual camera. So CraZy to me!4. Another minor... I wish you just push the shutter button to record a movie instead of finding the movie record button with is on the back of the camera by the play button. I like shooting movies with the view finder but it is too awkward to find and press the button with the camera up to my eye, and I do not want to set the dial and then press record while I am not even focused on my shot.So as you can see... from a Mom's point of view...

As an amateur nature photographer, it was frustrating to miss so many shots, even though I realize smaller subjects like birds present quite a challenge for these cameras.  Because I'm hiking through varying lighting conditions, I run the risk of missing my fleeting subjects entirely if I stop to change settings, so an excellent auto mode is a must.  Here are some observations after about 1000 shots with the HX100V.- I'm missing far fewer shots now, as long as I stick with the default \"Multi\" focus setting; the other AF options are less reliable, especially in low light.  One frustrating thing about zoom shots with this camera is you have to be at least 7 feet away for the camera to focus.  I'm noticing the need to step back a few feet as I'm trying to get closeups of butterflies.  With the Canon, I could be 4 feet away with 35x zoom and still get the shot.- Auto Exposure/Color:  Rarely a concern with the Canon, the HX100 is hit or miss.  50% of the time I get an absolutely beautiful exposure with brilliant color, the other half yields overexposed/underexposed shots with either oversaturated or undersaturated colors.  Refocusing once will generally clear the overexposures.- One feature that deserves special attention is Backlight Correction HDR, which lets me expose for a sky while still giving me color and detail in the foreground, and brings out leaves in shadow when focusing on a high contrast flower.- Sony really cut corners with this viewfinder.  Not only is it small, but the design is such that there isn't any breathing room for my eye area, so oils and perspiration quickly cloud my vision on a hot day.- Sharp closeups are easy; the camera will focus with the lens just an inch or two away, no Macro mode needed.This camera was obviously designed with versatility in mind.  Is it the best camera for wildlife?  Probably not.

This year  I purchased the Sony DSC-HX100v.Any camera does well with general photography, such as landscapes, people, etc and the Sony DSC-HX100v is no exception.  An image of woods or a field that is slightly out of focus or slightly under-exposed might still look good.I don't photograph these things.I shoot wildlife which I think is more exacting.  When you enlarge a picture of a butterfly, every photographic flaw pops out and it doesn't take much to ruin a picture.  I use zoom to telephoto to capture birds and mammals and close up for butterflies and dragonflies.  I sometimes shoot in automatic mode but more typically I use the manual settings or (P)rogram for extra control.The Good:The Sony DSC-HX100v has a proprietary battery, which I much prefer over the rechargeable AA's .  The camera also has a battery meter to tell approximately how many minutes of battery life is left.  I typically took 300+ photos on an outing and the battery still had  charge left on the battery.There are both a viewfinder and a large LCD screen on the back of the camera.The panoramic mode worked very well - you simply sweep across a landscape as you hold the shutter button downThe camera has a great grip; it balances well in your hand.  The proprietary battery keeps the weight down.There is a built-in in user's manual that you can refer to right in the field, on the camera's LCD screen.Placement of control buttons was not distracting.There is a combination zoom/focus wheel on the lens, which I didn't use.  You can also zoom using the more usual lever.The Bad:- LCD screen was useless in the sunshine.  It simulated midnight over the ocean on a starless night.- You can switch between 3 viewing modes - viewfinder only, LCD screen only, or both.  If you chose viewfinder only, then playback was also in the viewfinder only - an irritating annoyance.  You could solve this problem by choosing the viewfinder-LCD combo, but then the camera acted strangely.  When you first look through the viewfinder, it would be blank but when you start to zoom the lens in or out, the viewfinder would turn on and work.  Another annoyance.- What you see is NOT what you get.  Often the subject appear to be in sharp focus in my viewfinder but later I found out that the camera was out of focus.  It was very frustrating that many photos turned out lousy because when I was composing them in the viewfinder, they looked sharp.  I lost a lot of good photos this way.In order to avoid this, you need to pay attention to a little green dot in the lower left corner - a dot that is out of your eye's view as you compose your subject.  You must purposely take your eye off the subject to look for the green dot.  If the green dot is solid, the camera is properly focusing on the subject.  If the green dot is flashing, the subject is out of focus, even if it looks to be in focus in the viewfinder.  In either case, you have move your eye back to the subject and compose the shot again.  A pain in the butt.  Sony should have moved the green closer to the center of the screen so you can monitor it without taking your eye off the subject.To get the green dot to stop flashing, you had to zoom back, often quite far back.  Thus you lost the advantage of the powerful zoom.There is a \"beep\" that sounds if the green dot is in focus, however, there are beeps for other functions on the camera as well.  You cannot differentially turn off some beeps and not others, so you have to have all the \"beeps\" or none.  I don't want the camera beeping when I'm trying to shoot wildlife.- Exposure Compensation, a function I use a lot, is on a push button spin wheel - very handy.  However, Sony made the mistake of having 4 functions on this spin wheel - ISO, aperture setting, shutter speed, and exposure compensation.  Initially you click on the function that you want to change and then keep turning the wheel to get the desired setting.  However, the sensitivity of this wheel leaves a lot to be desired.  As I was trying to set the shutter speed, the wheel must have slipped and I was, instead, increasing  exposure compensation.  It was annoying trying to get out of that mode and get back to the shutter speed mode.Image stabilization (IS)  - erratic.  Often the little waving IS hand popped up to tell me that the image was not stabilized even though stabilization should not have been an issue.  On one occasion, this hand popped up when I was shooting a truck over 3 hundred feet away, in bright sunlight, with a shutter speed of 1/640 or 1/800 second.  There is no reason why image stabilization should have been a factor since the shutter speed was so fast.  Yet, the photo turned out slightly blurred!Zoom - This was bizarre.  Sometimes for close subjects, such as a butterfly near the ground just in front of me,  I could zoom out 30X and get a nice image. But other times, in order to get a sharp photo ( to get the solid green dot described above), at the same distance, I had to reduce the zoom down to 2X to 8X - which is one heck of a reduction.  I could not figure out why there was a difference.  Using my Canon PowerShot SX10IS in exactly the same situation, I was able to zoom out a full 20X (the limit of the camera) and still get a sharply focused photo.  I realize that with 30X zoom, I cannot get as close to the subject, zoomed full out, as with my 20X Canon.  But the Sony camera  just simply acted inconsistently.The Ugly:- Image Quality was inconsistent.  Even when the green focusing dot was properly  lit and the waving image stability hand was under control, photographs still did not look good.  Some of my photos are tolerable but I never attained the crystal sharpness that the Canon PowerShot SX10IS gives me.  All my Sony photos were \"soft', or slightly out of focus.  Correcting them with software just didn't quite get it right.Making certain that (1) the green was solid and not flashing, and (2) making certain that the waving IS hand was not waving at you, was very distracting and took away from the enjoyment of photographing my subjects.I read on-line that the Sony and other camera manufactures are cramming too many MP's into too small a sensor and as a result are giving up image quality.  I suspect that if this camera used relied on 10 MP instead of 16 MP, the Sony DSC-HX100v would be a really winner.I'm sending the camera back for a refund.  The Sony DSC-HX100v has many great features but it's not the camera for me.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "almost a hit, but flawed", "Author": "MrOutacontrol", "ReviewID": "R2KLHXPNWNRJRX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an interesting camera.Strengths-1. good image quality, nearly on par with a 4/3 at low iso's (provided you dial back the noise suppression and do a bit of work in gimp or photoshop).  No raw output, but with the noise reduction at minimum I don't think you loose much,given the sensor size. focus is accurate and fast.  Color balance is a cut above, Saturation is just a tad high but not bad.2. that lens!! No need to buy/carry extra expensive lenses. The lens is surprisingly sharp, with much less barrel aond pincussion distortion than the Canons I have looked at. I don't see much softness in the corners, very little chromatic aberation.3. decent low light performance for a small sensor, has built in features which can help produce above average \"snapshots\"4. Outstanding video--the videos I took at a wedding were of higher quality than those of the professional videographer.5  sound quality is better than most.Shortcomings-1. controls/buttons need to be looked at to be used as they are almost impossible to find by feel. This is a problem in low light situations.2. under incandescent, white balance off, most cameras in this price range are more consistant.  Can be fixed by manually selecting tungsten.3. camera \"feel\" is a bit cheesy, can be traced to a vibration from the lcd screen mounting arrangement4. software does not support linuxBIG ISSUES1. The lcd color profile is grossly out of wack.  When taking pictures (not videos) it is GROSSLY oversaturated, tending toward bright orang/red.  This makes adjusting the picture very difficult to impossible, which is one of the biggest reasons for choosing a bridge camera over a compact.2. Noise reduction sometimes goes crazy, leaving patches of the image (and in a few cases the entire image) smoothed to a detail-less smear.SONY HAS RECIEVED MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE DESIGN DEFECTS BUT WILL NOT ACKNOWLDGE A PROBLEM LET ALONE ISSUE A FIRMWARE FIXOther thoughts-good battery lifeGPS works, seems to be slownice to have manual focus, manual zoom just controls the electronic zoom.I have owned it for about a month so I have no info on dependabilityBottom line, this camera produces better images than similarly priced canon and nikon cameras.  The new Panasonic fz150 appears to be capable of better image quality without the above mentioned \"big issues\", has a hot shoe and raw output, but is not as good re: focus speed or accuracy and color balance.

Each generation of all camera brands lacked all of the features I wanted, such as 10 MP, live view, flip-down LCD (not swing-out), super zoom of 15x or more, image stabilization, easy to use auto-intelligence setting (for when I want a fast shot, e.g., for fast kids, dogs, birds, etc.), manual control settings available, ability to turn an on/off grid on display (for us who is composition challenged), long battery life, variety of charging options, and inexpensive memory cards.  The Sony HX100 can use several different types of cards, e.g., SD, SDHC, etc.Finally, after years of waiting and watching manufacturers getting closer to my \"want list,\" suddenly the Sony HX100 comes out and has all the features I want and then some.  Besides having all the features above, this camera comes with a hard copy  \"printed user manual,\" plus user manual on C, online  and built into the cameras menu system. Included in the box is an NP-50H (H series) \"Action Force\" battery, 6.8 volts, 870mAh battery and cable so you can charge the camera directly without taking the battery out.  I prefer charging outside the camera, so I easily found a second NP-50H \"Action Force\" battery online, rated at 900mAh (even better) and it works perfectly. Then, I also easily found a \"travel battery\" charger for the H series or NP-50H battery, which will work with either the 870mAh or 900mAh battery. It works perfectly too.As it comes, the HX100 comes with several cables. One cable for attaching the camera to a HD television to display your photos directly from the camera. Another cable for charging the camera with the battery still inside, or for downloading photos.  Here again, I prefer to use a multi-memory card reader attached to my PC, instead of downloading directly from the camera  (just my preference). I have used multi-memory card readers made by Transcend, HP or Kingston, just to name a couple that work very well.  I also bought a Transcend 12gb SDHC memory card for this Sony.  Works great.Additional info: - In camera charge takes 100 minutes - Shots per charge: 410 using the LCD or 440 shots using the viewfinder. - Very easy to use, with help advice available in the camera menu to help  you take better Photos. - Easy menu system. - CD comes with User Guide, Picture Browser Guide software (to catalog and  tweak all images on your PC). - Picture quality: Images tack sharp and great color. - Low light photos are excellent too, even without using the cameras  night time scene settings.In summary, yes, DSLR cameras are going to take superior quality photos compared to non-DSLR cameras.  However, this camera comes close and has the DSLR's beat because it is smaller, lighter, and has just one lens that does it all compared to my DSLR which requires a backpack to carry all the lenses.

I purchased it and immediately took pictures to test the various features. It was fall around here and the leaves had started turning colors and we had some beautiful weather. So I was able to test most of the features of the camera. I was pleased with the ease of use. I was able to get excellent pictures of most anything in bright sunlight. The panorama features worked well although it has some drawbacks. You can get a better picture by using software to merge pictures. You have more control over the pictures size by doing this.The color rendition was quite good and the lens stabilization even at high zoom worked well. The lens is not real sharp at the maximum zoom but this is not surprising. There are not many negatives of most of the functions of the camera. I suspect most people would be happy with this camera.I was able to take a number of videos with the camera and they all turned out to be quite good. The sound was fine and the pictures were quite sharp. The only problem was that the camera did not always maintain the correct white balance indoors which made color a bit off at times. But generally, I was pleased with the video quality.However, I returned the HX100V and purchased a Panasonic FZ150. I did so mainly because of a few features that I did not like or that I missed having. In indoor shots I took, I had a lot of trouble getting the camera to correctly handle white balance. This produced some off colors. I also missed being able to record in RAW mode. A couple of my outdoor shots would have benefited greatly from having recorded them in RAW mode. I am aware that many people do not use RAW mode so this would be a non-problem for them. Also, for some reason, I missed that this camera does not accept screw in filters. This means that you can not use a UV filter (probably to avoid lens scratching) nor can you use a polarizing filter. I have read that there is an attachment available for filters but that it is hard to find.Two rather irritating (to me) features were not photographic. The lack of an external charging device for the battery is strange. It would seem that it is less expensive to provide an external charger rather than supply the clumsy cords for the internal charger. The second irritating feature is the lack of a reasonable users manual. Supplying it in multiple file HTML format on a DVD is no substitute for a reasonable manual. Supplying it in PDF format would at least allow you a way to relatively easily print out any parts of the manual you want to keep handy.From my perspective, the camera would be given 3 stars but if you do not find those features I disliked to be of interest to you, then the rating would go up to 4 stars.

Genao \"Lisandro Genao\"", "ReviewID": "RC7FOLRE84K2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always wanted to buy a DSLR camera until I found out about this new line of bridge cameras. It's a crossover between point and shoot and DSLR. Looks like a DSLR but cost like a top of the line point and shoot with a lot more versatility, incredible zoom, and no extra expensive lens attachments to buy. So I have been doing some research for a few months now and have been putting my focus on the this Sony and also on a Panasonic DMC-FZ100 which in particular I think is also a beautiful camera. Personally I chose the Sony because it's a 16.2mp vs 14.1mp on the Panasonic, 30x zoom vs 24x for the Panasonic and last but not least Sony has the best Optical Image Stabilizer in the business. It has an active image stabilizer than uses 3 different ways to eliminate camera movement. These where the main features than made me choose the Sony. Also, for years the brand has never let me down. The Panasonic has a slightly wider lens and shoots 11fps in burst mode as opposed to 10fps for the Sony. Which means the Panasonic will take 11 pictures in one second in burst mode and the Sony will take 10 pictures in one second in burst mode. That is definitely not a big deal for me. The HX100V is absolutely fabulous! The pictures are crystal clear. The camera has a feature for low light picture taking that snaps several pictures automatically and according to the amount of ambient light. It then combines all of the pictures into one low light crystal clear picture. With virtually no picture noise also known as grain. I read a one star review that another member gave this Sony. I hope he did not return his camera as of yet because these are pretty hard to get right now. He was complaining that the camera did not have a feature to disable the picture preview after you snap a shot and that you would basically have to wait for the preview to finish before the LCD became available for the next picture. Well my friend all you simply have to do is press the shutter button half way and the LCD and camera become available instantaneously for you! I believe the camera gives you a preview of about 2 seconds which is definitely not a long time but if it is than in 1/8, 1/4 or 1/2 of a second press the shutter button half way and immediately the the preview is off and and the camera is ready and focused for your next picture. Just because the camera is showing you a preview of the picture you just took doesn't mean you have to wait for it to finish to shoot your next pic. I have not even read the user guide, I just used common sense. If you already own this camera try it. If you are considering to buy this camera don't let one persons opinion prevent your from buying this awesome camera. The video is spectacular! It records video at full HD resolution, 1920 x 1080 @ 60 progressive fps and records this resolution onto the memory card @ 28Mbps. The next step up from that is 3D-HD. In burst mode the camera takes 10 consecutive pics in one second, no delay, no lag time, no preview. After it takes the pictures it takes a couple of seconds to record the pictures that were just taken. I purchased my camera @ Bestbuy on 62nd Street and Broadway in NYC for $399. It was the last one in stock and I was getting the run around from the sales rep. He kept telling me that it was already sold but the system was showing one in stock. Well the store manager took care of that! I think the rep was holding it for himself.

Prior to this I had the original HX1, and a Sony 100 & 300 DSLR. I love the DSLRs but due to their size they don't travel as well as the smaller bridge cameras. I've owned the Sony Nex 3, which I sold as I couldn't get along w/o a viewfinder. When you buy the HX100V you do give up some of the sharpness of the DSLR lenes, but for the average photographer you're not going to notice a difference, as long as you don't need RAW picture files, which the HX100 doesn't do.What it does do very, very well is to take excellent pictures in all lighting conditions including low light w/o a tripod. Add to this some fun options like defocusing the background and the adjustable view screen are only but a few of it's advantages. Rememmber the last time you were at the beach and you were trying to take some pictures - typically you can't see anything on the view screen in direct sunlight. But, the HX100 has a super viewfinder that automatically turns off the LCD screen as you look into the viewfinder!You can go from full auto to many manual settings - so there are ample opportunities to become creative with this camera.Now, one of my favorite things about this camera is that I no longer have to carry my Panasonic TM700 camcorder. I purchassed that camcorder about a year ago due to it's ability to take 1080P at 60 fpm, and with one of the best optical image stablizations systems available. No more jumpy videos with the Panasonic. But wait, the HX100V has the same type of optical stablization and shoots in AVCH Hi Def video at 1080P 60 fpm just like the Panasonic! Shoot perfect videos in beautiful color w/o video that gives you a headach to watch. It's super! You can even begin walking with the video running and you'll notice it adjusts for this movement as it goes into it's highest stablization setting automatically. My Panasonics is for sale and I couldn't be happier with the Sony.

The menus almost do too much and are a bit overwhelming at first it really is not bad considering the quality at high ISO and the lack of CA at the extremes the lens shoots at. If you want to see the difference in image quality at cameralabs.com where you can compare it against other super zooms. I wish it would shoot in raw but it is after all a point and shoot not a DSLR and anyone who tries to compare it to one is being ridiculous.

Batteries. I found the battery that came with the camera to be quite good in terms of quality and life but if you are an active shooter who does not get around to a charger extremely often or forgets to charge then you will want to buy extra batteries and an external charger. This camera can either use externally charged batteries or you can charge one in the camera and use it at the same time with the included AC adapter, the AC adapter is extremely useful and is a welcome addition to my suitcase when traveling as whenever you are near an outlet you can juice it up or even shoot video or photos without touching the internal battery. This is great for when you are filming from a tripod and are not moving around much and are near an outlet, same goes for when you are shooting pictures from a tripod and not moving much.BUILD QUALITY - The camera is solid feeling and has a very durable look to it, the finish is not a shiny finish that will scratch, it is a dull finish for the camera body with speckles, almost texturized. I find this to be very welcome in my equipment. The lens has a shiny finish around the ring for zoom and focus which look's like it would get scratched ugly instantly yet I have had mine for over a year and put it to hell and back and still no scratches. The zoom / focus ring its self has some small scratches but that's the hard knock life my camera's live. The articulating screen is welcomed by me as it is not flimsy and is very solid on this camera, unlike some other camera's that I have tried. This screen is something I am not totally going to panic if I drop the camera. The lens and optics even when dirty produce the same quality images.IMAGE QUALITY - This camera produces stellar images all around, even in the pitch black of night time photographing the moon at 120x digital zoom came out very smooth with a minimal effect of image fringing which is common in digital zoom! This camera produces wonderful HDR stills with no Photoshop Required, just select Backlight Correction HDR, shoot the picture, and wait about 5 seconds and the screen pops out a HDR image! I really love working with this cameraVIDEO QUALITY - This camera produces wonderful HD video but there is only one kick in the teeth, you are limited to 30 minutes per video segment, and then you lose 5 seconds while it closes the file on the memory card, then you can tap record again. Annoying but otherwise okay. It is a camera, no one said this is a Camcorder. If you plan on shooting a lot of video where time is crucial then consider a Camcorder.Professional quality camera without the Professional price and need of being a professional to run it. And if you are a pro then you will appreciate this camera's manual focus and manual setting mode as you can go from a full auto into a SLR-like experience at the flip of a switch.Overall this camera beats every other super zoom camera I have tried hands down.If you are on the fence about buying this camera for photography get off the fence and get in the door and buy it.If you are on the fence about buying it for video, think again and consider a Camcorder.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT", "Author": "Snowman", "ReviewID": "R2RVNH51Y19NI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife bought this camera based on features and reputation, And I was completely impressed.

I am pleasantly surprised at the quality images that this camera produces.The Carl Zeiss lens is amazing.. for covering such a large range it has surprising low amounts of distortion and aberrations.Despite what I read elsewhere, the images seem to be holding up very well to pixel peeping, though you will not get the same level of detail you would get with a DSLR but unless you are going to print very large(above 8x10) prints, I doubt you will notice much of a difference.The twilight handheld mode is great. It takes 3 shots and combines them to reduce noise(since noise moves it can take the best pixels of the three shots and use it) and even works with a moving object by using one of the pics for the moving subject and then combining the other 3 to reduce noise in the surroundings.Takes HD video with stereo sound.Takes up to 10 frames per second... drawback is, once the buffer is full you will be waiting 10 seconds before you are ready to go again.Battery life is rated at 400 pictures(with the GPS turned off) and it will get at least that many. It doesn't come with a separate charger so you plug the camera in to charge the battery but there are many aftermarket chargers and batteries that are very inexpensive.You don't have to switch to \"macro mode\", in just about any mode, the lens can focus as close as a half inch.Some people report \"soft\" pictures but I just changed the sharpness from STD to HIGH and the images are very sharp.If you are ready to step up from a point and shoot but do not what the hassle or expense of multiple lenses, this is the best superzoom bridge camera on the market that I have used and I have used and/or tested many of them.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Probably the best camera for the money", "Author": "cartographer", "ReviewID": "RQ4J7LAWF4UQ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was getting tired of switching lenses on my Nikon D80, and couldn't find the focal length or the zoom that I wanted within a reasonable price range.

SLRs may give you more customizability of lighting and color once you hit the world of Photoshop, I want to be able to be able to see what I'm going to get right up front, and manage the color and lighting when I take a picture.  And if you take wildlife photography, having a good fast lens that offers zoom is a big plus.  I could spend $12,000 on such a lens. When you pay $400 why would you?  And as an added bonus you get HD video.  The only thing missing is a lighting shoe for a larger flash.  But given it does ISO 3200 fairly well, that's not bad for what you get for the money.  I even took the sharpest picture of the moon I ever could take, which was never possible with my $600 VR lens on my Nikon.

(Got it at Best Buy with a 10% off coupon)  I debated spending a bit more for a DSLR, but given the fact that I am only a novice photographer and don't have the skill level to use all the features/lenses of a DSLR, this seemed like a good compromise.  I've owned this camera for about 3 weeks now and have been very pleased with it.  I've primarily used the auto settings and have taken some amazing photos.  Outdoor shots in particular look quite professional.  I especially love the background defocus option.  Even my 14 year old daughter has taken professional looking photos with this camera.  I've taken a number of photos of my kids running around in the yard, playing ball, etc. and in most every case, the photo has turned out nice and clear, even with the action involved.  I have had a bit more trouble getting high quality, sharp images indoors in low light, but I'm still playing around with the settings and I chalk it up to user error more than camera quality.  Let me be clear that the pictures are still very good, just not AS incredible as outdoor shots in good lighting (which I'm guessing may be true of any camera until you really know how to use it.)  I have been reading posts on dpreview and beginning to educate myself on Fstop, ISO, aperature, etc.  I think with a bit more knowledge of these settings, I will be able to tweak things and produce the results I'm looking for in all situations.  For a newbie like me this is definitely a great camera.  I look forward to learning how to use more of the settings/features, but in the meantime, it makes it very easy to take great shots just using the auto/intelligent auto setting.  Some of the other reviews are much more specific and probably more helpful, but just wanted to add my two cents.  I would definitely recommend this camera!Only con so far is the lack of a manual that comes in printed form, or is easily printed from a computer, and the fact that I scratched my view screen on our first outing with the camera.  I think it might have been scratched by the zipper on the camera case as I was removing it from the bag.

You make a great camera and don't help the person taking photos how to work with it and make their experience better.There are SO MANY options and features, Sony just doesn't tell you how to use them.  Their manual is on-line only (except for the in-camera manual..ha).  On top of that, you can't even download it into a PDF or printable object.  You find the feature you want, then have to print that page only.  That's lousy.I've had a Sony H5 for the past five years and loved it.  I only upgraded to get HD video and better burst mode, better everything.  Don't get me wrong.  I love the camera.  It's just that some features are there...in the camera.  But when I want to find out more about it, the manual just tells you how to find it in the camera.

I will eventually get to know the features by trial and error, I guess.There are hundreds of positives.  One of the few negatives:  No ability to add a filter over lens, because they didn't put screwable mount on front.  Visible features display is a bit much....too many icons.  HD movies are cool, but you need to use Sony software (provided) to get them out of the camera onto your pc so you can convert to WMV or whatever else.  I ended up going for the MP4 mode so I can copy directly into my Cyberlink Power Director software.  It's still HD and nice.

I wanted something better than the usual sub-compact camera, but not as large, heavy and expensive as a full-blown SLR.  The Sony fit the bill.First of all, there is the lens.  At a 30x zoom, it beats any zoom you can get on an expensive SLR (or SLR-like) camera.  Of course, with an SLR you can choose to have multiple lenses that can cover any range of magnification, but that means carrying a lot of VERY EXPENSIVE, and heavy equipment.  If you are on a professional photo-shoot, that is fine, but for the casual leisure time photographer it would be a burden.The Sony has more features than you can imagine.  Besides all the usual scenes and modes, it has some unique characteristics, that are truly useful, not just hype.  The most amazing is its ability to overcome some of the limitations of the sensor.  While the Sony CMOS sensor is quite good for this class of camera, it is not the equal of an SLR's a larger, more sensitive sensor.  The Backlight Correction and Superior Auto modes, do a fantastic job of real-time correction for lighting conditions.  The camera automatically takes up to 6 shots, and combines them to correct lighting, and improve low light noise performance.Another incredible feature is the iSweep Panorama mode.  With one press of the shutter, the camera lets you pan the scene, and automatically takes as many pictures as needed, then links them together perfectly.  No need to manually stitch them together yourself.There are so many other features, such as built-in GPS, Anti-Blink, Anti-Motion Blur, Smile and Face Detection, etc. that are too numerous to describe.

This is somewhat surprising, as I was never much of a fan of superzoom cameras (they don't have the pocketability of a Canon S95 nor the picture quality of a DSLR). I purchased my first Sony camera (a DSC-TX9) not too long ago and was impressed overall, so I was happy to consider another Sony (we were a longtime Canon household but our Rebel T3i just wasn't getting a lot of use because it was so bulky). Due to the limited zoom capabilities of the TX9, I decided to spring for the HX100V based on the many good reviews on Amazon. I had a chance to give the camera an extensive workout on a recent vacation to Hawaii. Photos were taken primarily on auto (I am very much the non-serious recreational shooter), and in a variety of lighting settings. Overall, the camera passed with flying colors.Although it is definitely not a shirt-pocket camera, it is still much lighter than a full DSLR and wasn't a pain to carry around in a backpack with other gear. Startup time is quick, and all the menu controls are quite intuitive. The 30x zoom range is a marvel. There are other superzooms that have a wider zoom range, but there was really nothing that I couldn't capture with this, so it was a non-issue for me.Pros:30x optical zoom!Very little shutter lag (I was able to catch action shots easily)Beautiful LCDHaving a built-in GPS is pretty handy if you do a lot of travel photographyPanorama mode is a lot of funGreat image quality on auto setting (you can probably get even better results if you are handy with manual settings)Best video quality I've seen in a non-DSLR cameraLight for its sizeOne-touch video button on the back of the cameraCons:The one-touch video button is slow to start recording (you'll miss at least 4-5 seconds after pressing it)The LCD gets washed out in bright lightThe lens cap is fairly flimsy and falls off easilyOverall, despite some initial misgivings about getting a superzoom, I'm very happy that I bought the HX100V and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a great travel camera.

I have bought the camera and there is an errata correction sheet enclosed that indicates this correction.I have been an amateur photographer for the last 30 years. I have never wanted to buy DSLR due to bulkiness and prohibitive costs to have zoom range upto 30X. I also wanted a camera that captures good still pictures as well as be capable of HDMI P. This does it all.I like nature and wildlife photography without having to use a tripod.This camera meets my requirement with 30X optical zoom, Video upto HDMI 60P, various modes such as smart panorama. Also the camera can take stills in various formats. I have used a 32 GB, Sandisk SDHC extreme III card (Class 10+) to ensure adequate memory capacity with speed.  I am truly amazed at the shake free pictures that I get at 30X zoom made possible by optical shake correction. I recently took a shot of a pigeon on top of a ledge about 40 feet away with 30X zoom. I am able to see the toe nail of the pigeon clearly. The videos are excellent due to high frame rate. In my view the camera captures true colour. I am making this statement with my visual perception without extensive laboratory tests. As I capture shots on the move and not into any artistic photography this camera suits me very well and I am convinced that I don't need a DSLR. The GPS with Compass is very good helping me capture location data. I just used the GPS function to automatically set the time of the Camera clock and direction of view. The camera battery life is good though with GPS On there is 25% exrtra drain. I have bought a spare battery with charger to address this issue. This has  excellent stereo microphones right on top with a wind noise cancellation option. I am yet to test this feature in high wind conditions.

With the 30X zoom, I can capture the animal shots clearly from very far while in the national parks.-- One of the new features I appreciated particularly is the HD panoramic. I always liked Sony's I-Sweep feature. Now I can do it \"taller\" (I mean width) with standard clarity.-- I noticed that, even the resolution is set to 16MP, the file size isn't so big, from 3M-4M.-- One thing that upset me was that, when taking the photo in I mode, reviewing the picture on the LCD shows very strong color, as if it's using the \"vivid\" setting. Then I changed to P, and manually set to \"real\" color, that solved the problem. HX1 doesn't have this issue. However, after loading the picture to my computer and viewing from the computer screen, the colors are right even the photos were taken in I mode. So I think it could be an camera LCD display issue. Could just be a firmware issue, since P mode doesn't have this problem. But that's just a minor thing.I love this camera.

He responded & communicated via email until we got this worked out. It only took about 2 weeks between me shipping it in & them getting it back to me repaired. All the time in between was lag in communication between Sony support & me. So if you can get a live person's attention, you have a chance at getting your unit repaired.UPDATE: August 15, 2012. Camera works great. While we were waiting for this one to be repaired, we bought another just like it.  Both are great.

There are things I love about it, and things I hate.What I love:--The tilt out LCD screen. LOVE IT, and will never again have a camera that doesn't have one.--The long zoom.--The great pictures. When all goes right and the stars align in the heavens, the pictures are sharp and clear.--The compact design.What I hate with every fiber of my being:--The processing time between shots. I take a lot of shots that need to be taken quickly. People, animals, etc. This camera is absolutely terrible for that. Once you take a photo, a bar pops up on the screen and it takes several seconds to process. That's several seconds in which I cannot take another photo. I've missed a TON of great shots because of this. There's no way to turn it off, no way to make it stop.--Images always look fabulous on the LCD screen, but not always so fabulous on the computer. An image can look crisp and clear on the camera screen, but when I transfer them to the computer, they might be a little blurry or too dark. It doesn't always happen, but it happens way more than it should.--The video file format and the transfer process. I've never had a camera that used the file format that this camera does, and I'll never have another one. It's horrible. Absolutely horrible. I'd say it was a pain in my backside, but this makes a pain back there look like a day at the park. It's THAT bad. However, if and when you ever get the video off the camera, converted to a different format, burned to a DVD, and get it on your television, it's great.

[I had ordered from a Big Box store over two weeks earlier, but it didn't arrive; overnight shipment by Amazon saved the day.]  But it is remarkably straightforward, at least for general shooting (still experimenting with other capabilities).  I got some absolutely amazing shots of a wide variety of wild animals, birds, people, and scenery, and am in awe of the capabilities of a 30X digital zoom.  So far I am not as impressed with video mode, but that isn't a primary interest and it may simply reflect a learning curve.  Camera has a great 'feel' in the hand.  I am old-fashioned, and prefer to compose with one eye looking through the viewfinder, which is very easy to use.  Over 2800 shots on a single 16 Gig card - and it was still not full.  A spare battery is essential for such photo opportunities.  Recharging was easily accomplished each night.  Even better now that I have obtained a separate charger - which I wish had been included with the camera.  This camera allowed me to take photos that far surpass anything I could have taken on the 10X digital camera I have used for years - especially important when one may be shooting wild animals in their habitats from distances of 50 - 100 m at times.

The HX100 records some of the most natural looking, sharpest video in and above its class. It is actually sharper than the video from my Sony Alpha 57. While some users may report color that lacks the movie look, it is because this camera records more like your eye sees images with colors that are natural and not overly saturated. It is not the most light sensitive camera in low light, but it produces an image that has very little grain as the lighting gets darker. Even Sony's own successors, the HX200 and HX300, don't produce an image this sharp and clean, although they are more saturated in color.Most camera functions can be controlled manually, which is a plus for this class of camcorder. The lens, while exhibiting a fair amount of geometric distortion (straight objects appear slanted) at wide angle, the chromatic aberration (color fringes around objects in the corners of the image) is very well controlled.

They asked me to send it in at my cost, pay for return shipping, and also pay a warranty service fee!! Screw that.  That's what I get for buying it online from the manufacturer.  They can mail you a defective product and get away with it.  You have to spend more money to get it to where it should have been in the first place.The camera is ok otherwise with very nice features.  Picture quality under certain conditions can be better. Flash doesn't engage in Auto mode when you expect it to so the pictures come out dark and grainy.Still, I will never buy from them again and will spread this bad experience to everyone I know.

Many  other brandt already released them.* The Video size : It will helps if Sony can not only give the HD record option, but also the low resolution option like WVGA, VGA, XVGA; not only HD takes a lot of places and it consumes time to convert from HD to a * * lower resolution with a software. Why not having this features directly from the camera.* Video stabilization and speed - We expect Sony to lower the speed while taking video and to give a better video stabilization.* For a better ergonomic Sony could swap the selector roller and the on/off switch button and also put the finder/LCD button behind the camera instead(like near the LCD screen)* Price - The camera worth the price but other good brandt are 100$ or more cheaper. Sony could revise it next year to get more buyers.Congrats to Sony for these features :- Background Defocus- Superior Auto Mode- Sony PMB Portable software- Motion Detection- Sweep Multi Angle Mode- Anti-Motion Blur Mode- TransferJet technologyThis movable LCD is very good and useful to take photos from different angles, we hope Sony will still keep it in future cameraI recommend this camera to Everyone", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "received replacement camera", "Author": "Barry S.

This may be small for some of you but big for me, even with the burst effect turned on.  I missed too many shots.I looked for an option to turn this off, could not find anything in the documentation.

But well, this is a review for the camera not the delivery service, right?I've been using a Sony DSC-W35 for 4 years, it's a fantastic camera with awesome macro and great landscapes autoconfig, but in my last travel I really missed all these new tricks like the wide panoramic pictures -specially at Mariposa Groove :'(- and extra zoom. So, based on my experience with Sony, I decided to give Sony another try with the HX100V (the Nikon P500 was very close).I bought this camera mainly because:1. I'm a hiker, so I really want to keep track of my sightings in each shot with the embedded GPS. Neither Nikon nor Canon have this.2. I like wild life, so I need extra zoom.3. I love macro-photography, so I wanted a camera with the same macro capabilities of the DSC-W35.4. I'm addicted to accessories, and this camera will kept me away from bankruptcy because it has so few of them. I can reuse the same memory sticks that I had for the old camera and use the SD cards of my other gadgets. If I would've gone for a DSLR, I'd simply never be happy knowing that I'd never be able to afford the neverending list of nice accessories.5. I love landscaping, so I need good panoramic features.Why three stars?The camera zoom do not focus in the medium distance. If you want to take pictures from spiders that are like 2 or 3 meters distance you need either approach to the dangerous spider the enough to use the macro or walk away like 10 meters to use the zoom.Conclusions:1. Except for letting you to select what subject you want to focus, this camera will take your shots and exclude you from thinking. If you just want to take family photos and video and impress your friends with the zoom, this camera is definitively for you.2. If you are going to spend 430 bucks in this camera, may be is better to spend another few bucks and get a DSLR: they are the same weight, same size, same functions and will let you take better shots.3. For me, this is just a normal digital camera, but bigger, with GPS, and with extra zoom.4. For me, this camera (and the Nikon P500 and the Canon SX40) are not an intermediate between digital cameras and DSLRs, I think these are just trivial digital cameras with some steroids.5.
