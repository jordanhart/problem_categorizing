I've managed to take some great shots with this camera (Will post a picture soon).  I'm still working on getting in the habit of using the post processing, but it really makes a difference in the image quality.I wish the camera would remember my processing settings when I turn it off.I've also managed to drop the camera a few times (a couple nasty drops too!) and it's still going strong.  Probably related to the drops, I've recently (after over a year of ownership) had some issues with the flap that opens to get to the battery/sd card.  I have to use a grocery store rewards card to pry it open.  Slightly annoying, but probably my own fault.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "14.1-megapixel resolution\n4x wide-angle optical zoom; 2.7-inch LCD screen\nNewly-developed EXILIM Engine 5.0\nMake composite images of different moving images with Dynamic Photo; Art Shot Function\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Casio EX-Z550 14.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Zoom with CCD Shift Image Stabilization and 2.7 inch LCD (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41F92L340EL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0031WO1F4"}}
