{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Starter DSLR for set and forgetters", "Author": "Patrick Alford", "ReviewID": "R29COZIOCJC8AS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is perfect for someone, who like me, is/was tired of the results from the typical point and shoot camera.  Yes, you can get a super long lens for the price of this, but no way the tiny sensor in that will match what this can do.  Also, I'm not there yet when it comes to manually setting a camera, but with this the auto settings are almost full proof.  You can hand this camera to someone else and still get a great family pic.  I also love the auto crop feature, generally gives you a great secondary composition.  All in all, I have to say for $500 this is a hard to beat package.  There was only one downside to this deal, the bag is woefully undersized, and they provide an hdmi cable that is of no use with this camera, I guess that's two, oh well, doesn't diminish the cameral and lens package in the least.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F9B1ARM"}}
