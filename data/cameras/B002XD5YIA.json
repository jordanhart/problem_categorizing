We need to shout in his presence so he can hear. The aplification it provides might fall short a wee bit. However, I tried a few other productions and this is pretty much the level they all are at.

Contacted vendor, they have fabulous customer service! Even sent a replacement. Both only crackled and hummed. Couldn't hear anything. I didn't bother to return either item.

New battery lets it do a good job of amplifying \"noise\", but nothing helpful to me.
