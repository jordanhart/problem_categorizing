For 237.09 the kit should include 8 batteries in addition to 4 packed with the camera, 2 rapid batter chargers, kit for cleaning, 32 mb chip for storage, 30X zoom, padded case, table top and full sized tripod (Bower), high speed micro sd read/write usb /wallet to carry storage card/ and lcd screen protectors, ac/dc charger.  I had enough points accumulated with the Amazon Credit Card to acquire all this for 0 cost.  I will be using it to shoot photos for my next book, so this is not a casual decision. I am rating this camera a 5 for the features, accompanying equipment, and price. One other very important feature of this camera is that it runs on regular garden variety AA batteries, so I can pick them up anywhere if the rechargeables aren't recharged. You also do not have to pay more money for NIMH batteries but can use them if you wish. Always on the run, this is a huge benefit for me. In addition the energy saver features make the batteries last longer than I have previously experienced with digital cameras.  Fujifilm gets a resounding FIVE.I have still not recieved the lcd screen protectors and was shipped the WRONG CAMERA in the initial shipment, requiring shipping the camera back to the seller, BIG VALUE INC, for an exchange during the pre holiday season. The correct camera arrived right before Christmas. The lcd screen protectors have not arrived as of January 7, 2012 and the initial order was placed 12/06/2012 from BIG VALUE INC.  I may have to buy them separately to get them, because I do want to protect this camera. There was some confusion about the meaning of the listed ac/dc charger, with BIG VALUE INC saying what was meant was the regular wall plug in charger. The company did send an additional digital accessory kit with cleaning supplies and a strange little camera case that didn't fit any gear I have and did not want a return of these items that seemed to be sent in an effort to stop me from requesting the lcd screen protectors or asking for clarification on the meaning of AC/DC charger. I do not hold Fujifilm responsible for the aggravation caused by BIG VALUE INC and intend to keep calling until I get my lcd lens protectors that were supposed to be in the kit.If you are looking for an extraordinary value on a great camera and equipment, I highly recommend this comprehensive bundle, just be vigilant about the correct camera being in the shipment and that you recieved everything that comes with the promised kit.
