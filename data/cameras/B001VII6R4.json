There are only four touch buttons on the side of the screen you can press.  Along with two other hard buttons it makes for a cumbersome navigation of the settings and zoom.  It's also hard to take self pics as a finger or part of your hand will enevitably hit one of the touch buttons.It's also not very click and shootable.  You have to hold down the shutter at least until it's done focusing which can take from two to five seconds otherwise it will not take a picture.  When it does take a picture there is no quick preview.There is no way to turn off the \"squeek\" for each button press.  There is no sound in movie mode.  The flash setting ALWAYS resets back to no flash which isn't a bad thing as using the flash somehow makes everything either darker or extremely washed out.", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "THERE'S NO MICROPHONE ON THIS CAMERA, NO SOUND ON VIDEO", "Author": "Amie M. Luna \"STEVO\"", "ReviewID": "R24AL2NXEPCW4K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my daughter for x-mas and she ended up hating this camera for the below average quality of the pictures and the main reason, there is NO SOUND when recording video! I thought there was something wrong with it until I called the manufacturer and they confirmed it has no mic. The description on amazon and on vivtars website does not state this.(very misleading) It confuses me why someone would make a camera with video but no sound..? Thankfully J&R; Electronics let me exchange it for another camera since it was within 30 days of purchase. Very disappointed by Vivitar. Whos big idea was it to put this thing in stores without a sound feature... WOW", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Quite Disappointing so far", "Author": "NLC79", "ReviewID": "R2WPJRXWWJGGAT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a Christmas present as my Fujifilm digital camera was becoming outdated and wasn't functioning properly.  The hubby thought he was doing well, getting a good deal on a nice camera. Well, I don't think it will be long before we upgrade. My first issue is that there is NO internal memory, you have to have a SD card before you can even start taking photos. The pictures I took on Christmas were in a home with basic incandescent lighting, and they turned out either incredibly dark or crazy neon bright when I changed the flash settings. There are a ton of settings, however, I have not used many of them with much success. I had several pictures turn out quite blurry, even though the camera boasts an anti-shake setting. It takes AAA batteries, and uses them up QUICKLY, no possibility of recharging. I did take a video that turned out OK. I do like that it has a multi-pic setting that allows you to take 7 photos in quick succession as the action is going on in front of you.  I also like that it has the potential to link to your favorite social networking websites, Myspace, Facebook, photobucket etc. However, I have yet to see this work, the disc that came with the camera does not register my internet connection therefore I have not successful saved the software onto my computer (yep, you can't even set up the software without the internet connection, super). Hopefully as I experiment and learn more about the camera's settings and potential, it will work better for me. But, I will not be holding my breath....", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "vivitar t328", "Author": "M.

The \"point and shoot\" auto mode is better for outside shots. For inside photos it needs more settings to be made manually by the user. I would avoid using too much zoom as it pixelates the picture and makes it difficult to take a clear shot. The only real defect is the LCD viewer. It doesn't give an accurate display of the photo that is taken. On the computer the photo looks MUCH better.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't Do It!", "Author": "T London", "ReviewID": "R1I4LPC9HND7AS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought a Vivitar T328 camera while on vacation in NY City about a year ago.  At the time, I was satisfied with its value and performance.During this years vacation, my sister joined us and I had an opportunity to compare her Sony camera pictures to my Vivitar T328 pictures.  Both camera's were 12.1 Mega Pixel and set to full automatic.  Sony pictures were clear, crisp, nice colors and proper light representation.  The Vivitar pictures were fuzzy, too dark or too bright, and grainy.  The pictures were taken at the same place in the same lighting.I am giving this Vivitar T328 away (Goodwill or my kids) and getting a better digital camera.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "still have not recieved this camera from a month ago", "Author": "moonbeam", "ReviewID": "RPEJ1JTP2R3A7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Could not tell you how the product is because I have still not recieved the camera.
