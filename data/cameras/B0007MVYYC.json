Caiola \"Patti\"", "ReviewID": "R6NEJWYFWVCW0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera and within minutes (about 7)out of the box I was up and running.  Snapping photos and loading them on the computer.  The Kodak software works great with my XP, and the kodak interface is easy to work with.  Some photo editing features, email and print straight from camera.  Literallly plug in the camera and after it downloads the photos (seconds) it will automatically prompt for printing or email.  Way cool feature.The camera settings are easy to use, dial is clear and well placed.  LCD screen is viewable in bright light.  Manual flash settings are convienently located, camera feels comfortable in hand, SD slot placement is logical.  I am not sure what was confusing to others in the reviews seen here, my fiance who is a camera novice (and not computer savvy) was up and shooting photos as soon as I handed him the camera.  There are a lot of features on this camera, what a great value for the money!  Kodak online has great photography tips and help for you and your camera, as well as a downloadable user manual.Also, yes there is an option for manual settings like a good old fashioned SLR camera.  If you are not familiar with traditional 35mm SLR camera settings...then either don't use this feature, take a intro to basic photography course, or buy a cheaper camera that does not offer manual settings.  I have had a tried and true SLR camera for years and love it.  I was excited to find an affordable digital camera that combines what I like about \"point and shoot\" style camera, and manual settings that I like about my 35mm SLR.  SO - the feature is there, I thought it was pretty straightforward how it works.  So if you are familiar with fstop, aperature, ISO, etc...this will be no problem.The quality of the photos are amazing!!  In the \"Auto settings\" mode even.  I have tried many of the special featured setting specifics like the Museum/manner, People inside at a party, and Close up modes and have been happy with results.One not so great thing, the non-rechargeable batteries that came free with the camera lasted us about 4-5 hours total.  So, I reccomend a great quality rechargable set of batteries.Also, FYI, the internal memory holds about 16 pictures or so.  I purchased seperately a 256 MB SD card and now my camera will hold just shy of 200 basic photos (mine says 198).", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very Good inexpensive camera for intermediate user", "Author": "Arcane Radio", "ReviewID": "R3F94ELB2OK6B4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Digicamera. For the price you can't really beat it. This camera takes excellent pictures in the dark.Great, clear, full of features. This camera is not that difficult to use either.

It's very nice for all types of light too.Best value for the money.", "Date": "December 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Awesome Little Camera", "Author": "R.

I've have an RCA digital that I bought several years ago and it's been a great camera BUT it doesn't have the options like the newer ones have today.  With my budget I had to conserve on my spending but at the same time I wanted something I would be plezzed with...I finally decided to go with the Kodak Z700 and let me say, I'm not sorry for doing so...This \"little\" camera packs a punch.  I love how \"easy\" it is to operate and with a little bit of reading in the instruction booklet that comes with the camera, I found it's pretty easy to navigate thru each type of settings.  I also like the Video/Audio feature it has built in...Overall, I would Strongly Recommend those with limited budgets and want an awesome little camera then by All Means..BUY THIS ONE....You Won't be Sorry...5 Stars is my choice for this camera.

It seemed each had strong points and some negatives.  Any proprietary sticks or the Canon with its bug got eliminated from my list.  Getting tired of the research I made the plunge and bought the Z700 based on good reviews and great price.  Tempted by higher MP cameras but once you get to a certain point there isn't much noticeable difference in quality.  The 4MP does a great job.  Also, try to get as high of an optical zoom as possible--the digital zoom on all cameras is just about worthless and just a big number for advertising as far as I am concerned.  Most of my film photography was macro and telephoto so the best for under $200 was important to me.Like others--right out of the box I was taking pictures and downloading them to my laptop.  Spent the first day running in & out of the garage to download to the laptop because I didn't order a SD card at the same time.  Now have a 1GB San Disk and am loving it--be sure to format it first.At first, I noticed a clicking that sounded somewhat like a small electical short.  Discovered that this is the focusing.  I set mine to single focus and no more funny noises.  I like this better anyway as it seems to speed up the shots since it is not constantly trying to focus on more area.  It has a large sweet spot and you can also chose which area you want to be the primary focus area.It snowed and I used the PAS (manual settings to compensate for the brightness).  Later discovered the SNOW mode which did about as well but the manual settings seemed to be just a little bit better.  It is easy to bracket your pictures with digital.  This is something that I was always hesitant to do with film because of the cost.  With digital turn the dial & try a different picture mode if you don't like certain ones just hit delete.SCN is one of the wonderful features with a lot of the different (manual) settings done for you.  Just select the type of picture environment--backlight, night portrait, night landscape, manner/museum, text, children, party, portrait, beach, flower, fireworks, snow, self portrait (this is great and no red eye).  Automatic doesn't get much use by me.Like another reviewer discovered the night shots are great.  Took some in a pitch black room and they turned out beautifully--clear and crisp focus and color.My Nikon SLR will probably not get much use anymore and end up on Ebay.  Focusing for me was becoming an issue and this Z700 does quite a good job.The video is fun--not high resolution--but fun.  I walked my 6 acre property and documented boundary lines with video.  The dog howling and romping in the snow was also funny.The Z700 was really meant for a gift for my 11 yr daughter.  She took over 100 pictures today and most turned out very well and quite creative.  Maybe there will  be an expensive Canon EOS Digital Rebel in the future but for now I am a very happy Kodak Z700 digital camera owner.Since nothing gets a perfect score from me it gets a 4.  It is pretty close to perfect though considering its features and cost which make it a great value.  Will just have to wait to rate dependability and longivity.  Don't hesitate to buy this as it is a great camera and not a problem yet with over 300 pictures taken.", "Date": "February 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Love Camera, Hate Printer", "Author": "Dawn E", "ReviewID": "RSSG5B4Y62KLE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Don't waste your time with the printer...

I took a trip to Florida in January.  When I got back and printed out selected pictures of my trip, people couldn't believe that they were from a digital camera.  I don't know much about all the specifications and what it all means, but the camera takes excellent pictures.  I even used some of the \"fancy\" settings to use different speeds and f-stops.  It was great to be able to see instantly what the pictures looked like.  I realize that this is an attribute of ALL digital cameras, but I have a new found appreciation for it.I have one small complaint about the printer.  If you are printing a large number of photos, the paper tray doesn't hold alot of photo paper.  That is it probably holds maybe 20 pages or so, but if your printing more than that, you have to reload.  I had some problems with that, but I think it was more the computer/printer being finicky!I hope you enjoy this camera and printer as much as I do!", "Date": "February 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Amazing Colors and Detail for 4MP digicam for such a low price!!!", "Author": "Posaunemeister \"Posaunemeister\"", "ReviewID": "R3ATB6AGPD46DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This truly is an amazing camera for its price. A great value. The colors are bold and the detail is just as good as any other digicam I've used (even ones that cost more), and the design is very ergonomic (it fits well in your hand, especially if you have huge hands like I do). In addition, the layout is very simple; therefore, it is extremely user friendly. The additional software is great as well. My only con towards this camera is that it really does suck the life out of batteries in no time (even top Duracell and Energizer batteries, as well as the Kodak \"Digital Camera\" batteries that come with the camera). You should definitely invest in rechargeable NiMH batteries or you'll end up spending a fortune on disposable batteries.I use a 1GB SD memory card and I get 788 pics or 57min in video footage (with sound).

I had been using my father's way-out-of-date 2.1 megapixel camera for about 2 years, and wanted an upgrade to a better camera.  When I was searching, this was not on my list of cameras to buy.  I was looking at ones such as the much more slim Sony Cyber Shot DSC-W5.  I made sure to give my mom a list of all of the ones I wanted, since Christmas was approaching fast.  When I opened my gifts and found the Z700, I wasn't sure what to think, and I admit I may have been a bit ungrateful.  From the package, it appeared to be clumsy to hold, because since I'm left-handed I tend to take pictures up-side-down so that I can hold a camera with my left hand.  The design of this prohibited me from doing that, because the grip on the side was a bit awkward and manufactured for right hands.  It also appeared really bulky against other cameras I've seen, because the grip plus how far the lense zooms out makes it a big camera compared to others.  It also runs on normal batteries, but it CANNOT use alkaline.  They last all of about 5 shots.  You have to buy either special batteries from Kodak, or lithium batteries, both of which are extremely expensive.  With my first few uses, it was hard getting used to the large design, and the LCD screen was smaller than I had expected as well.  After about a month or two, I started getting used to it.  Once I got past the size, I realized it takes very crisp pictures.  The digital zoom is useless because it adds pixelation, but the normal zoom is very good by itself.  The LCD pretty much washes out in bright light, but the viewfinder is very helpful.  THe same happens in low light.  It has a lot of settings that are found to be useful, such as night portrait, night landscape, text and documents, and self-portrait.  The sports setting is also useful.  It's hard to focus on closeup stuff in auto mode, but the self-portrait option takes care of any closeup stuff.  It is also a heavy camera, which makes it feel a lot more sturdy than some of the lightweight aluminum cameras now.  The dial is a little hard to turn, and the buttons are a little hard to press, but everything is really easy to figure out, and you'll be taking great pictures in no time.", "Date": "January 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Super easy to use camera & printer", "Author": "JTrull", "ReviewID": "RGCAJT09OY7FF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera and printer.

The 4MP digital camera takes vivid pictures and will allow clear enlargements up to 11\" x 14\". The 5X optical zoom lets you get a little closer look than most 3X optical zoom digital cameras. The neatest feature on this camera is the built-in lens cap that automatically shields the lens when the camera is turned off. Kodak digital cameras are #1 in ease of use for a reason - they are point-and-shoot simple for everyday users, but have the extra settings to tweak if you want more specific control. This camera will take compressed video clips depending on the size of your memory card. You will want to purchase a larger SD memory card than what is included with the package. With the included cords, you can hook the camera up to a TV to view pictures you have taken or have it display a live view. This is indispensible if you are babysitting.

The included batteries were a joke. I got it rechargeables (still stay charged for a pathetically short time) and a dock almost as soon as I got it.Ease of use: I guess it was ok, for 2006. For 2009, the screen is pathetically small and the controls feel clunky.Features: this is its most impressive attribute. The camera does have minimal semi-manual modes, which is more than many consumer-model digital cameras. It also has all the \"special\" modes one would ever really need. That said, the camera is horrible indoors (especially without flash) and at night. This is a bright sunny vacation type of camera.Picture quality: 4 MP isn't bad. It can be a little tricky to get it to focus correctly sometimes. Pictures often come out with bold, bright colors. Again, a great vacation picture camera. Overall picture quality is decent, but here, the exceptions overshadow the rule. Low-light, indoors, night are all bad. You don't realize how many non-sunny days you take pictures on until you find yourself desperately trying to get a good picture with a camera that just won't deliver.Portability: This thing is really chunky for what it is. If it was loaded with features and had amazing picture quality, I could maybe understand it being this big. But if you're looking for a marginal, consumer-level digital camera, there's definitely more pocket-sized (and less frustrating to deal with) than this out there.

Five years of rugged use (I am NOT known for being gentle with cameras).Cons:As mentioned in other reviews, the 16mb card and included batteries are a joke.  Kodak should have left them up to the buyer to provide and reduced the price by a dollar.  I personally only use rechargeables and use a 512 or 1k SD card.

The camera doesn't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk, also in my opinion. It truly is junk now as I got so frustrated with it, I threw it on the floor and smashed it.  Not kidding! When I first got it,I called Kodak and they told my son( who is knowledgeable in this stuff) how to reset the printer.  We reset it and it worked for awhile.  Then it wouldn't work any more and I did away with it.  No more Kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked.", "Date": "February 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice looking camera; not user friendly nor quality", "Author": "John Studt", "ReviewID": "R10H1GTHU2KL8O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for $199 at Walmart -- and promptly returned it a short while later.Pros:  lots of settings, easy to use (in automode)Cons:  lots of settings (too many), the LCD viewer doesn't reflect the actual photo, and taking low-light pictures is very cumbersome and not easy.  So, this camera is not easy to use for common family pictures indoors; photos are always dark unless a flash is used or manual settings are enabled (the settings of which require a rocket-science degree to understand).", "Date": "September 8, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0007MVYYC"}}
