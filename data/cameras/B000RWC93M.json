{"Reviews": [{"Title": "cheap price, cheaply made", "Author": "R. Miller", "ReviewID": "R1NZB5E50P8TO8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera came with terrific features for a great price.  It took fine photos.  Unfortunately, there was a problem deleting pictures in-camera (the cursor would scroll wildly on its own.)  I emailed Kodak to return it as defective. The camera body itself is not metal.  It is thin, flimsy plastic made to look like metal.  The knob on the top used to choose photo styles is flimsy and would turn and change while inside my pocket.  If you want an inexpensive camera that has great features and are willing to baby it so it doesn't get crushed or broken, this might be the camera for you.  If you're as tough on cameras (or do extensive traveling, etc.) you may want to look for a sturdier camera.  After returning the Kodak (sad, since this was my 4th Kodak camera and they have never let me down until now,) I bought a Pentax Optio M30 that has a metal body and sturdier controls for about the same price.", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera for a beginner", "Author": "M. A. Valadas \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "R2VOOY3Q63MOZ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a chrsitmas present for my sister. She wanted a small camera, with plenty enough of modes and easy to use. I have to say that I got the camera a couple of days ago, and I have expereminting with it. And I have to say that is a great camera for a beginner. The digital image stabilization is great for those who don't have a steady hand, and it comes with great picture taking modes, such as snowy day, baby mode, self picture close up, candle light, sunset, amog several others. I extensively experimented with some of these and the panorama mode, and I have to say that for a camera like this, the pictures came out great.The panorama mode was really easy and the results were amazing.I've experimented with low light in the ISo mode, and I really liked the compensation.If you are a beginner and if you want a small, handy and fun camera for a great price, I think this is it!", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "very pleased", "Author": "K.

Lees", "ReviewID": "RA2972ANTDXBG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera with the intention of using it with my current Kodak Printer Dock Plus, but it is not compatible even with the D-22 adapter that Kodak says that you need.  According to Kodak, the 2007 model cameras are not compatible with the adapter.  To date I have not received a satifactory resolution from Kodak.  I am sharing this in the hopes that I can save someone else the frustration.  If you purchase this camera, plan on purchasing the G610 printer dock if you want a compatible printer dock, as that is Kodak's recommendation.As far as the camera itself, I have been pleased with the quality of the pictures (at least how they look on the LCD) and the fast shutter speed.  I am but a casual camera user, I regret that I cannot even say photographer!  Only gave it a 1 star rating for the printer compatibility issue and the customer support given by Kodak to date.", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Digital Pocket Camera", "Author": "James D.

At the time I was extatic to acually have a camera to call my own. Well as the months past by and I got to know my camera better, I noticed that the pictures I was taking where coming out very clear (and this is without developing them yet) and I was amazed at the prafomance it had for such a small camera.When I got my photo's developed I was even more surprised at the quality of the them.The features on this camera I have to say are very nice, it's great to have so many options, it's easy to use and take it from me, takes wonderful pictures. It's also easy to carry and very durable.I am a Photographer, and at the time when I was gifted this camera, I had no idea what career I was best at. Because this camera took such great pictures, it got me interested in photography and I can't picture myself being in any other career! lolSo if your looking for a good camera, despite the other reviews you might have read, I'll tell ya this is a wonderful camera.

Seemed like a great deal ($90) and the perfect opportunity to upgrade from my Kodak DX4330.  Right out of the box the camera looks good on the outside.  It is light and small.  Unfortunately, it takes horrible pictures.  I've tried indoor/outdoor, full light/low light etc.. All of the pictures came out grainy.  When I called the Kodak help desk they said it was caused by incorrect ISO settings.  While slightly changing the ISO settings somewhat helped the majority of the  grainyness remained. My 3.1 mp DX4330 takes much better pictures.Don't get me wrong, I know there are ISO settings for a reason but if I have to fiddle with changing the ISO setting every time I want to take a picture I might go mad.BTW, don't bother with the Kodak M883.  According to the CSR it has the same issues.AVOID THIS CAMERA LIKE THE PLAGUE. you would be better spending a little more money to get a quality product.", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Battery problems", "Author": "daddygimp1934 \"Brownie\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q2VEV542CMLK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera uses a proprietary Kodak battery, not standard AAA or AA cells.
