Because of his recommendations I bought the M883 due to wanting  a small camera that would fit into a shirt pocket. I didn't want a bulky camera that would be a chore to carry. The Easyshare software as the name implies is very to install and use, it installed with no problems whatsoever. After installing it, I checked for software updates and the update installed with no problems. After the battery charged the first time, I went to the Kodak support site to see if there was a firmware update.  The firmware update was easy to install too.  The M883 takes very nice pictures and is a good value.  It is not a $1000 DSLR camera so don't compare picture quality to an expensive DSLR camera.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not the best Kodak out there", "Author": "Megan Lafollett", "ReviewID": "R1NPO76IWSXW4S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loved the last Kodak easyshare I purchased -- it was intuitive and easy to use and took great pictures without much effort. I was excited to see the m883 come out, because I wanted to upgrade to something sleeker and slimmer, and it had one of the largest LCD screens out there so I could actually share the pictures still on the camera without breaking out a magnifying glass. I still like the fact that I can easily slip it into my pocket, but I get very annoyed trying to take pictures of my young daughter with it, because it takes FOREVER for a picture to process and the shutter speed is really slow. I have to use the Sports setting to have any chance of getting a non-blurry picture, and if I want to capture a smile or cute expression I pretty much have to use the \"burst\" option. It's also quite difficult to hold the camera steady because it is so light and thin, a side effect I had not anticipated.On the pro side, the controls are very easy to use and the menus and tools are as intuitive as always. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of video it can take. But overall I think Kodak let me down on this one -- which is really sad because I had high hopes for this camera.As an aside, I also have to say that I am not pleased with the new version of the Easyshare software either. I recommend downloading Picasa2 from google instead -- it's free and much, much easier to use.", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "BEST Camera I've ever owned.", "Author": "Rizwana Sikandar", "ReviewID": "R18TMB6C6BZACF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is really amazing!!!

Gardner \"RPG\"", "ReviewID": "RKD9U2MDTBGD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was my first camera that I have bought, and I like it. It charges fast, and takes great daytime pics, and  some not as good night pics.The thing that I really like about this camera is how easy it is to use, deleting pictures only takes like 2 seconds.The video on this camera is better than other cameras that I have used, but it wont replace your video camera.This camera has a huge display, 2.7 inches I think which is great for seeing your pictures on. Overall I would recommend this camera.", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Mediocre at best. Spend $50 more and get a real camera", "Author": "G. Jakobsen \"HappyDoc\"", "ReviewID": "R3AJARYM5FWIVT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on a two day road trip. I had forgotten my cam at home and, for $119 at K-Mart, I hadn't much to lose. I have had Olympus, Canon, Sony in the past and decided to try the Kodak. The camera held up well, was easy to figure out, and had decent battery life...but, despite what seems a nice collection of features, the photos have consistently turned out grainier than my other cam (6MP). Low light photos were not worth saving despite using several \"evening\" presets. Comparing the over dozen shooting modes, I found little if any difference in photos.When shooting mountain views, portraits and a video of a street performer, my friend's 6MP canon powershot consistently turned out much better photos. This was based on same view, with me shooting half the photos on their cam, and they shooting half on mine over a three day period. Suffice it to say, plain daytime photos at fairly close range will be adequate, but forget enlarging or any lowlight. Video isn't much better. It says 8 Megapixels but I'd swear it's half that. Cough up another $40 or $50 and you wont kick yourself later.

The first few pictures I took outdoors were OK, and the panoramic mode was a novelty. However, when I tried to take pictures indoors, I noticed the display was grainy - and the pictures were HORRIBLE.  I thought it was user-error, and tried every combination of settings.  At any MP setting, the pictures are grainy with incorrect color. Kodak was running a promo at Best Buy, and this model was \"highly recommended.\" It is an inferior piece of junk at any price, and I wish I could return it. The USB connector is non-standard on the camera end. Picture transfer is SLOOOW, and often the device is not recognized by the PC.  I have totally lost confidence in this brand.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R2PNWRZTVQBIEU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a gift after graduating high school and it really opened me up to photography. The Kodak EasyShare M883 was my first personal camera and the point and shoot did well. It was easy to use, settings were simple. I liked the style of the camera, it was real sleek and small enough to go anywhere. 8 megapixels is good enough for quality images, video quality was good. I liked the fact that it came with a rechargeable lithium battery.The downside I had was the digital zoom, everytime I utilized the 5x digital zoom to its full extent the pictures were grainy and full of noise.Other than that the camera is easy to use, great for beginners.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just ok", "Author": "Stumpy Joe", "ReviewID": "R21O8HR776JV4S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My M883 just died on me.  Took a picture during lunch, drove home, and now when I turn it on, the lens pops out, screams at me twice, then shuts off.  I bought the camera in September of 2007, and have treated it as new ever since.  I found out I could pay about 100 bucks to have it repaired, or...well, anything but that sounds better.It's an ok camera.  To be honest the main reason I bought it was its size, and experience with Kodak cameras in the past.  Pictures were usually a crapshoot--sometimes they looked grainy, sometimes they looked perfect.  My biggest gripe would be the blur...no amount of fiddling with the settings would help make some of the blur diminish.  I feel I have steady hands, and even when I tried my hardest to keep a steady shot, I would get the blur detector.  I imagine if the camera were on a tripod, there would be some blur if the wind was blowing.Like I said, I bought this camera in '07.  It served me well, but if two and a half years is its average lifespan, I don't think it's worth the price.  Especially if you throw in the sometimes great/sometimes just ok pictures.  It was a very easy camera to use, which was nice, and I'm in no way a photo snob, so the picture quality didn't totally bug me (all the time).  I'll miss my dead M883 camera, but probably not that much.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed...", "Author": "French baker", "ReviewID": "R1AWX6LDJWW4RL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As a 3 time Kodak digital camera buyer, I didn't think it was necessary to test the picture quality on this camera before I purchased it.  I simply took a brand new box from the Best Buy display table and wrapped it up for my husband for x-mas. Boy was that a mistake!  I soon discovered that the pictures on all settings were grainy, blurry when zoomed to 5x7 size, and even had poor color quality(more like a painting than a photo).  Returning it was a nightmare; I was forced to pay a restocking fee for opened merchandise, so please take my advice and test this item before ordering it online. Unfortunately Kodak has lost my respect for introducing a new model camera that takes worse pictures than my 2 previous models.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Yikes!", "Author": "Fought Piranhas", "ReviewID": "RCRZSHUUWQRK2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I decided to purchase this camera as a Christmas Present to myself, what a mistake.  The first one I bought wouldn't charge.  I had it plugged in all night long and the battery never even charged enough to even turn the camera on, that should've been an indication of things to come.  The next day I went and exchanged it.  On Christmas night we snapped photos all night long on all kinds of different settings, with and without the flash. I noticed that the images on the LCD screen on the camera were really poor quality but I didn't think much of it, I just figured that maybe that's how the screen was on that camera.  I didn't think they would look just as bad once they were downloaded onto the computer.  I honestly how they can call this camera 8 Megapixels, the pictures are TERRIBLE.  They are extremely grainy and the color almost looks oily.  I can't believe how far superior my 4 megapixel PowerShot is to this camera.  I will definately be returning this camera, and will not be buying another Kodak anytime soon.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Horrible camera", "Author": "Jennifer Brown", "ReviewID": "R1HUWZW3GRY0EV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last spring before my wedding.  I'm not a serious photographer and just wanted something simple.  I'd had EZ shares before and figured I'd upgrade to the lastest model before our honeymoon.  Like others have mentioned, the picture quality on this camera is nothing short of atrocious -- slightly better than a cell phone.  I figured it was just me until I stumbled across these reviews.

Obviously, there was a contest or something going on as there is NO WAY anyone would want to trust their pictures with this camera!

It had enough of a charge on it for me to not mess with plugging it in or to put a memory card in that day. I took about 20 pictures Christmas night, and when I plugged my camera into the computer to charge it and pull the photos off it wouldn't do anything! No charge, no connection, no detection in any of my 11 USB ports or any of the three other computers in the house. I assumed it was that specific cable and schlepped down to the store where it was purchased where I had to endure a 45 minute hassle to get a new camera and for the tech \"support\" to pull the pictures off of the old one (if it doesn't take a charge and you're giving me a new camera, put the NEW battery in the OLD camera long enough to pull the photos off. I'm not a rocket scientist and I figured that one out). I take the new camera home, still mostly satisfied, and I assumed I had just gotten a dud.A few days later I used it to take pictures at a family birthday dinner, and last night for new years (but this time I put the memory card in first). During our celebration last night the battery died, which didn't phase me. We'd been taking pictures for about six hours already. After I came home today I plugged it into my computer to charge and pull the photos off. Guess what? No charge, no connection, no detection.I'm taking this camera back again tomorrow and exchanging it for something that isn't a total piece of junk.It's too bad, because I love how this camera takes pictures and how big the screen is. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. Plus the EasyShare software is a joke. It's not easy. It's complicated and makes it difficult to pull your photos off the camera and put them somewhere other than the EasyShare gallery.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "horrible", "Author": "SamIAm", "ReviewID": "R1389GASGMUTMY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is cute and small, so it is easy to take with you, and it is easy to use, and it has a nice big display screen (3 inches).  That being said, it takes horrible pictures, which is much more important.

Harding", "ReviewID": "R3JIVPTNCZMYY0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera since my old one was outdated. I just wanted something that was thin and lightweight. I didn't think that taking bad pictures would be a problem for current cameras, but for the Kodak M883, it really is. Unfortunately, I bought this camera without reading reviews beforehand and I was very disappointed when I discovered how badly it captures indoor photos. I haven't taken any outdoor pictures yet, but from what I have seen so far, there is a lot of digital noise in the pictures. When turned on, the LCD screen shows a lot of static and does not focus very well. It's a bad idea to take pictures without flash with this camera because you'll only end up with a blurred image.A good thing about the camera, though, is that there is a \"Scene\" option where they are preset functions for you to use in different scenes (i.e., portrait, night landscape, candlelight, text, etc). I spent a lot of time trying to fiddle with these options to somehow get a good indoor picture, and I had a little success, but my efforts didn't leave me with photos as crisp as what my other camera gave me.I'm really sad and disappointed about this purchase and would not recommend this camera to anyone.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Overall A HUGE Disappointment", "Author": "CloudsInMyCoffee", "ReviewID": "RTBJGU9GEN90I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a Christmas present. Just judging from its appearance with the large screen and sleek frame, I thought it was going to be a definite upgrade from my older, larger digital camera. Well, you know what they say about judging a book by its cover... The image quality is terrible and even my old camera takes less grainy pictures. I know it was a gift and I should be grateful, but really, it was a huge disappointment and still is.Also, the manual that comes with it states that when the camera is charging, the battery charging light on the FRONT should be lit up. Well, that wasn't the case with mine since it stayed unlit and I couldn't tell if my camera was even charging or not. After a very unsuccessful chat with one of Kodak's online tech support staff, I googled it enough to find that besides other people having this problem, that in fact it's the light on the BACK that lights up when charging. Unbelievable. Maybe that should get the manual right, put that on the site, or I don't know, tell their \"technicians\" about this doozy.Honestly, don't buy this camera.
