I was a little concerned about the mixed reviews but I thought I would take a chance. I have and love my Canon G10 but did not want to carry it everywhere with me.  I needed a little camera to carry with me and not worry about. I purchased my Powershot A2200 for 129. and could not complain about that. I liked how you can move through the different modes quickly and I especially liked the live mode. I am an artist and it is very important for me to control color and contrast and I can easily do that in the live mode. I understand the problems some of the other reviews complained about especially the blurriness. I too had blurry photos when I first started using it. This camera has a learning curve - it is a very sensitive camera and you have to become familiar with it and choose the mode ( program, live , auto ) that is best for you. Also there are several options to control in the focus of the camera. I suggest you become familiar with it to improve your results.  This is a good camera for someone like myself that is familiar with using cameras and want options for controlling images.  If you just want to point and shoot and not think about it - this may not be the best choice. I am really impressed with the photos I have taken. I mainly use the live mode - it is a very flexible mode - shooting well in low museum light and even out of a fast moving car.  Given what I received for this cost I am very pleased.

I spent several weeks shopping around for a digital camera that could do it all and I think I got it when I bought this camera.  It met most of the criteria on my wish list with 14.1 MP and 720p HD video.  The X4 zoom was initially my only disappointment but after playing around, I soon discovered that it goes more than x4, just at a lower quality picture.I love how easy this camera is to use.  It takes really clear pictures with ease.  My previous digital camera had over a second delay and half the time my shots turned out fuzzy.  With the \"Easy\" mode, the camera does all of the work for you and usually the camera is right.  I use this to take pictures of my 3 year old daughter who is constantly on the move and the camera takes nice clear shots.  Also the camera is fast (for a digital).  From the moment you click the button, it is only a split second before it takes the shot which makes it easy to capture the moment you want to keep.I also enjoy the \"Discrete\" setting.  I used this setting while visiting a museum and I love that there was no embarrassment of beeps and clicks while I fumble with the camera to turn off the flash.  It's fast and quiet and the camera still took a good picture in low lights w/o the flash.  However I did have to rest my arm or the camera on a stable surface.I haven't played around much with the video camera yet.  The zoom lense is noisy so I think that might pick up with the sound quality but considering I had good luck with still photos on low lights, I don't think the video will be a problem as long as the camera isn't jostled too much.For the price, this is the best camera your money can buy.  I know that there are better camera's out there with more features, but this does everything I could ask and more for a family camera.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't rely on Auto mode & you'll be happy for the price", "Author": "Adam Norris", "ReviewID": "R3VNGFL74OI6ZO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is not the type of camera where you can leave it on auto and assume everything will be fine. I did that but within a couple of shots I found the settings to be overly bright & very noisy as it looks like the ISO had been cranked up to 1600 (which is ridiculous for any compact) for a not so dark room. Its best to switch straight to Program mode and get accustomed with the manual controls. Thankfully Canon has realised that some people don't know anything about cameras and has provided an inbuilt help system (which can be turned on/off) to set examples of what each thing does, this can save a lot of time & avoid reading through the 200 page PDF manual! Very handy for those who are just about to leave on vacationThe discreet mode is great for those that need to take a photo but don't want to attract any attention. This mode will not use flash & will not make any sound at all aside from a tiny mechanical movement. Unfortunately the LCD screen will still continue to emit light since there is no manual viewfinder to look through. The colour reproduction is actually pretty accurate, its possible to replicate what you see with your own eyes (something that's usually impossible whilst indoors with compacts). The optical zoom mode is nice, you get a choice of both 4x optical & digital zoom of up to 16x. If you want to preserve your photos I strongly suggest turning digital mode off. Thankfully its quite obvious where the digital zoom will come into play as it'll pause for a second before continuing & you'll notice a line inbetween the zoom bar. The LCD screen itself is nice & large & easy to view under direct sunlight - a problem that arises even amongst DSLR users!Now for the bad points, the lack of IS (image stabilisation) is disappointing as a lot of images in low-lit rooms will get blurry even if your hands seem like they're barely moving. The all plastic casing is also worrying, I'm pretty sure that the tripod holder isn't even metal which means it could wear down quickly & wobble around. The delay between shots is very slow taking about 4 seconds to get from one to the next. The plastic cover that covers the USB transfer cord is also disappointing as not only is it hard to get open but feels like it'll eventually be ripped off accidentally. Although this camera seems to take good photos via manual controls you'll instantly notice upon zooming in that it'll still have digital noise including the flash shots so detail will be lost during editing even if you're only shooting in 2MP (less than 20% of its full resolution). Camera distortion is another issue with that rounded affect on straight objects at angles and a lot of the features are gimmicky and aren't helpful for anyone who's serious about photography.However I'm probably being a bit too harsh since coming from a DSLR. It is an all round good budget $100 camera & you'll no longer have to worry about using flash for dark indoor shots which usually kills the photo with false lighting. Just be warned that digital noise will popup on occasions & a few shots will get pretty blurry without image stabilisation, if this worries you, aim for something a bit better.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "Matt Hoover", "ReviewID": "R2EUVLXFMFNRI1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the other review of this camera and decided to purchase it anyway.

I have owned a Samsung camera, I paid over $200 for, it was also a good camera. When it broke after about 2 years, I bought a Fuji. We don't use that one anymore because it took too many blurry pictures. I got this Canon camera because it was on sale at Target. Target gave us a $30 gift card for buying it. What a deal!  It has a lot of modes to choose from, should satisify the simple shooter to those looking to take better and varied pics for something like a SCRAPBOOK anyone?!? The fish eye effect would rarely be used, but you see its interesting for funny photos (they picture a dog that was shot using the \"fisheye\" effect above). Maybe if you hate someone from work you can use fisheye and make their nose look huge then tag it on facebook, I don't know. Hehe.But here are some of the features:First of all, you can always change the settings of the timer, flash, and display (you can have the date show on the pictures...or choose not to) no matter which types of pictures you wish to take. You always have the options to change those things.Now for the meat: The notches you can choose on the wheel up top are: Program, Live, Auto, Easy, Scene, Effect (I guess I'll call this one that), Discreet, and Video.Program mode, you can adjust all of these settings:ISO speedWB setting (white balance I think)My Colors (black/white, sepia, custom, etc.)Single shot or Continuous shotEvaluate (brightness based on overall scene)Size of the shot (From 4320x3240 for 16x20 inch pictures down to 640x480 for email attachment pictures...they also include a widescreen option)Normal quality or Fine qualityLive mode you can adjust:Dark --------------  LightNeutral ------------VividCool ---------------WarmI never use that mode.The auto mode they choose all the settings for you other than:Size (16x20\" quality or email attach quality, and all the qualities in between)Normal quality or Fine qualityEasy mode, you cannot change anything other than the things you can always change, like timer, display, and flash. Guess they wanted to make easy mode...well...easy.For Scene mode, the choices you have the options to adjust depend on the scene you select, for instance, if you choose portrait you cannot adjust white balance, but if you choose blur reduction, you can. The scene modes you can choose are: Blur reduction, portrait, landscape, kids&pets;, smart shutter, low light, beach, foliage, snow, fireworks, and long shutter.In effect mode (don't know what it's actually called, but in function set the effects are the things at the top you can change) you can change the effect; choose from fisheye, miniature, toy camera, monochrome (b/w, sepia), super vivid, and poster effect (a unique feature). In most of those effects you can change to normal or continuous shot, and normal or fine quality. Some you can also change the picture size.Discreet mode is fantastic, you can take pictures quietly and discreetly, all you hear is a tiny \"click\". Won't even wake a sleeping baby, trust me. You can adjust white balance, colors, single or continuous shots, picture size, and quality normal or fine.Video you can adjust standard or miniature effect, white balance, colors, and quality from HD movie 1280 or down to 320 (longer movie, lower image quality)There is also a zoom in/zoom out on this camera, and a massive amount of other things you can do as well...like downgrading the picture size after it has been taken, viewing slideshows, etc.  You really would need to read the book to learn of the full potential of this camera. I recommend this camera. I do get some blurry pictures, but not too many. The stats on blur are probably about 1/10 really blurry, and 2/10 slightly blurry (from an isolated blurry arm to edging seems a tiny fuzzy). Most of them are clear. The pictures I take are mostly pictures of my kids at home.

Glickman", "ReviewID": "R2N3GQEMHM0IMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave this camera to my girlfriend for Xmas as her Samsung point and shoot was borrowed by one of her daughters and returned without the shutter button.  How does that happen?So to begin this review, let me start by saying the A2200 is NOT a camera for a hobbyist, semi-pro or someone wanting to shoot in manual and learn the exposure triangle.  It would NOT be my choice for a creative tool to be used to \"make art\".  However, for the vast majority of amateur camera users, who just want to point and shoot and take snapshots, this little Canon is a ton of camera for the money and all they will need.  For under $90 street price, you get a lot of bang for your buck, and much better image quality than you can get with an iphone camera.First, the lens is very good for the price class:  opens up to f/2.8, 4 times optical zoom and 28mm on the wide end.  Better specs than the lens on my $300 Canon SD780.  Second, the processor, DIGIC 4, is also very good and Canon somehow managed to pack 14.1 megapixels on to a 1/2.3\" sensor without creating a noise monster.  Third, Canon figured out how to make a SMART AUTO setting that actually works properly.  For a novice or someone who just wants to take snapshots, this is all they need.  Just compose, squeeze the shutter half way to lock in focus and exposure, and snap away.  If you can't do that basic procedure, stick with your camera phone.  Seriously.  Rant:  It amazes me how many people spend no time at all composing, then they plunge that shutter button down, shaking the entire camera, not letting the poor thing autofocus.  And then they take crappy pictures and blame it on the camera.If one wants to expand their photographic envelope just a bit, the A2200 has creative filter options, such as miniature effect and fisheye, to name just two.  Also comes with a lithium rechargeable battery and more cables than my Nikon DSLR shipped with. Canon is good about giving the consumer a decent set of accessories.I've tried all the creative filters and various settings and it was not difficult for me to take a few artistic shots with the A2200.  My guess is the majority of users will keep it set to SMART AUTO and be happy with the results.Bottom line: the A2200 is an excellent choice for someone desiring an inexpensive point and shoot.

It has a lot of features (mini mode, fisheye mode, vivid mode, ect..). It has the potential to take great photos, but I often find it difficult to focus with certain lighting; and there is sometimes a delay after taking a photo (no \"continuous\" shooting). I will say i'm impressed with its durability. I've dropped it on concrete floors, throw it around, and it still works like it did when I first bought it. It has a large screen in the back (no viewfinder), so if you do end up somehow getting the LCD screen to break... well, good luck. This camera supposedly shoots in 720p HD. I guess you could call it \"HD\", if HD looked something close to 360p. And once recording has started, it does not re-focus. Plus, the audio recording isn't great (a lot of noise).

Obviously if one is moving rapidly and shaking the camera, you can not expect any camera to take a clear picture, but with good lighting or a flash, this Power Shot takes clear pictures. Even when there was low lighting, the camera still takes decent pictures (but not as clear).I've taken this camera on several rendezvous over the past month since I've gotten it, and have used it at the beach (high light exposure), camping in the mountains (fire and nature), at parties (people moving very quickly), and on rainy days (poor natural lighting).

Now, I am not a professional photographer, I do know the difference between a digital SLR camera and the lenses and technologies which make them such a popular choice amongst consumers, however, I wanted to get back to the basics of point and shoot. The A2200 is a great digital camera, it provides excellent optical zoom, which, to those of you aware of, is the actual camera lenses functioning to focus on an image.Digital Zoom is a feature I usually shy away from, yes, I am aware that not every single camera out there isn't going to be equiped with some form of digital zoom that relies on the camera processor putting in pixels for the image to 'appear' closer, but, still comes out grainy. So, with the auto focus, auto flash and battery fresh out of the charger, I snapped a few shots around my house. I must admit, I was a little turned off by the grainy film washed look in the LCD screen, but my photos come out gorgeous on my computer. While I don't need to edit them down from the huge 2xxx by 10xxx format I took them in, I am still experimenting with lower resolutions to find my personal 'sweet spot' that fits my needs. All of the features that come with the camera are pretty standard, including anti-blur, various scene modes and a few other options I haven't necessarily envisioned myself using but i will definitely experiment with them throughout the life of this camera.I have been using my cell phone to take pictures, which holds one major problem that digital camera's all remedy, which is a dedicated button for snapping pictures and above average anti-blur feature along with a better flash. (Honestly, I read reviews on tech websites, i don't see how the reviewers can touch the screen to take the photos without shaking and ruining the picture).I am using an 8GB memory card, it's great capacity with the max settings, I have some where around 1700 photos I can take before needing to transfer the files over.A few points I didn't touch on but, might be a selling point:Does not have a touch screen, I mean, the button layout isn't fancy, but it's made to where you can get around within a few presses.The video is so-so, but, you don't use digital camera's to record video, it's a feature i will rarely useComes with composite out cables for review on a television, cable length is pretty short, but most blu-ray players and televisions have card readers anywayNo view finder is built into this unit, get used to using the LCD screen when taking a photoI'd buy this camera for those who want a point and shoot, it's a great niche between price and function which I highly recommend coming from a FujiFilm FinePix camera with 6 less MP and 3x optical, it was a sweet deal when I got it (free) but the quality of the photos I took were often grainy, blurry and 3 out of 10 times unusable.I bought this camera on black Friday with Amazon Prime, shipped last week and due to the weekend, I received it the following Wednesday.

I replaced the A95 with a Powershot SX20IS. After I dropped the Fujifilm and broke the lens (whoops), I replaced it with this Canon A2200. I bought it on sale, and with an employee discount and I am still dissapointed with it. It isn't bad because it's an inexpensive camera, it's just bad. I don't trust the Canon name anymore.Even in ideal lighting conditions most pictures turn out awful. The other day I took my son out to the zoo. It was really nice out - sunny, but not too bright. I thought I could trust the A2200.First picture (auto mode): the lighter colors are washed out (with white patches, even), the rest of the colors are muddled. Fuss with the settings a bit - my son's pink cheeks are blotchy red, his jeans are neon blue. Fuss with them a little more - his face is either bright white or bright pink, his hair is either gray or dark brown with a funny looking \"crown\" of reflected light. He is either frozen by an overly-aggressive flash, or he looks like a grainy blur. I finally fuss with it enough to get a really fantastic looking picture (as good as I would NORMALLY get with any of my other/previous cameras) and the next ten pictures I take look overexposed. Sometimes I can get a good photo - but most of them are way off.This camera might be fine for some people, but from my experience it is not a good camera compared to others in the same price range.

After reading reviews, I bought this PowerShot thinking it would be somewhat of an improvement. That was an understatement. It's such a great little camera. I'm so used to changing AA batteries every couple of times after using the flash on my old camera, yet the PowerShot didn't need to be charged for weeks after taking hundreds of pictures.Even though it takes great pictures, it has a major flaw, but it's not the camera's fault. If you're not a person who is up to speed on the auto-focus feature on digital cameras, it might take a bit of practice to understand how it works. I let my mom use the camera at my field of study's pre-graduation ceremony and she had such a hard time taking pictures. I had her take a few practice shots the day before and even though she struggled a bit, I thought she would be able to use it well. Nope. She was highly frustrated with the auto-focus and hated the idea of not being able to just point and click. Instead, it's more like point, lightly hold down, wait, then click. After the ceremony, she told me she didn't like the camera at all and would be using the old digital camera from now on (which didn't have the precision auto-focus).My own complaint would be the zoom feature. If you zoom too far, the pictures, even at a far enough distance, come out grainy and fuzzy. Still, it's a great little camera for the price.

It alsoallows you to define a lot of settings yourself, so you do not have to dealwith automatic settings. Also it has a relatively large display so you can viewthe image. I also think it is quite easy to operate in general. To set thebasic shooting modes with a little wheel is a very good idea.However, otherwise it is basically a quite expensive piece of junk!It is probably one of the slowest digital cameras on the planet.I don't know what happened to Canon, but theymust have thought to design a retro-camera with readout out times you had withthe first digital cameras about 15 years ago. Unbelievable! If you want to makeany kind of photo of a moving object it will be moved out of the picture by thetime you can shoot the photo. Even if you try to take a photo of a static objectthe quality of the photo is poor. It is grainy, noisy, and blurry. I have setthe camera to 80 ASA, the Fine resolution and 14.1 Mpix and still got grainynoisy photos. The optics is poor, too. All photos show a blurring which you'llget from scattered light in the optical system. My son has a$25 Vivitar camera which is not only significantly faster, but the images areonly slightly worse. Now you won't expect an excellent photos with a $25 camera, butyou can expect some decent shots from a $100 camera. We also have a 4 year old Canon SD 1100ISwhich is a good camera, so I did expect that in 4 years Canon would haveinvested some money into development. Well, they did, for some gimmicks, like atoy camera effect of softening for portraits. However with this camera this is apermanent feature. Instead of wasting money for gimmicks like this it would havebeen better spending the money on developing better optics, CCDs and readoutelectronics. The A2200 is basically useless, except if you like grainy, blurryimages of something that does not move. Then this is the camera for you.So as a conclusion, the A2200 looks nice but that it. Otherwise I would notrecommend this camera at all. It's a complete waste of money.My wife actually returned it back to Walmart and got a blender instead.

You see, the A2200 is a reasonably solid camera with surprisingly good picture quality for the fingernail-sized sensor, which is par for the course with Canon; the optics are about equivalent to the kit lens on an EOS Rebel DSLR, so although you won't be reading shelf tags from 50 feet away, you can still print out a pretty good sized blowup of any given shot. If you don't need 1080i video out of a pocket camera, this is pretty much all the pocket-sized camera you'll need. (Yes, it's pretty slow on the draw, but if you need speed, consider moving up to a system camera, or at least a bridge camera like the SX40.) The 14.1Mpx resolution is excessive bordering on ludicrous, and unless you need HDMI out (in which case you should move up to the Elph/Ixus series), you're not going to need much more than this. (Which is not to knock the A3300, but...)But one of the big selling points of Canon's 2011 A-series (at least from the 1200 up) is the addition of what Canon calls Creative Filters -- a series of special effects that mimic some of the capabilities of other cameras. That's the sticking point here, and, well, apart from fisheye (which works well enough to avoid spending gazillions on a fisheye lens for your DSLR) and the monochrome settings (bluescale is an interesting touch), most of it is fluff. The miniature setting, for example, is meant to duplicate the miniaturizing effects of shooting long distances with a macro lens, and really kind of doesn't work. The toy camera setting (probably the feature that will most jump out at a prospective buyer) is, to put it politely, fraudulent; it's like a Budweiser version of a Holga. It lacks the unpredictability that makes toy cameras popular, and the aggressive vignetting is a little too extreme unless you crop back to a 120-like square frame. (It also seems to pull some strange optical tricks when used with a flash and sharp corners, but I don't think I could reproduce that if I tried.) The Live View mode is much more useful if you want to tweak the colors to get that expired film look. The Discreet mode is a very nice feature indeed, perfect for taking into a store and taking picture notes of price tags or other sneaky behavior that you'd normally pull with a cell phone. Video quality is okay, not spectacular; the lack of image stabilization and live video zoom on this model makes it more of an afterthought than a useful feature, though it should work fine on a tripod.I was not able to test some of the more esoteric capabilities; the CHDK port for this model is painfully buggy (a supposedly-usable version shipped a couple days before this review but I haven't installed it yet), and from what I understand raw pictures come out with badly garbled color data, rendering them essentially useless for any purpose but debugging. One-handed operation is clumsy (one attempt while writing this review accidentally triggered the onscreen clock function) but workable with some practice. The software is the same software that Canon ships with all their cameras; I can't speak for the Windows side, but ImageBrowser for Mac has most of the same functionality as iPhoto, only a bit less polished.So, in conclusion, if you need an inexpensive pocket camera, the A2200 should be everything you need. You won't go wrong with it, although some of the features it includes are vastly overrated. (Expect to be laughed out of the room if you're entering your photos in a low-fi photo competition; it's incapable of sucking enough to do the job right.) For that reason, I have to give it only four stars.
