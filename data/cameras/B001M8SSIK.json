But as a door alarm, the clip really is too thin - no door closes so tightly that you can slip the clip in and keep the two pieces touch so the alarm does not go off with the door closed. I taped a piece of non-slip pad on the side of the door to make it work.

It would probably scare the intruder away, but I'm a somewhat heavy sleeper and this probably wouldn't wake me up inside my house unless I was in a room right next to the truck - which I'm not.I've used these types of alarms made by a different manufacturer (don't know which) and it was so loud you were racing to either turn it off or get away from it.Maybe I got a defective unit and the one you buy will be better, but maybe not.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Personal or Home Alarm Best and Loud sound.", "Author": "Carol", "ReviewID": "R1GEACHLV7O6C9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great alarm.
