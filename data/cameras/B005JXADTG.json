CMOS Sensor and 4 x Optical Zoom (Red) produced.  The pros are easy to see both in the video and my list below.  The two main cons weren't as noticeable while recording, but very noticeable wen I transferred to my computer.  With the zoom, it was obvious that a lot was lost when using it. This is a big downfall, especially if you plan on using this underwater because between the water and the zoom the quality of video is sure to be less than stellar. As for the sound I can't explain the cutting in and out.  The microphone is set high on the camcorder near the lens, so I wasn't covering it up with a finger or coming close to it at all. To be sure that it wasn't user error I made several other videos and all had the same sound issues.Pros:Nice size and designEasy to set-up, navigate and transfer videosReasonable priceGood picture quality when not using zoomComes with wrist strap, charging USB cable and small velvet storage pouchArcsoft MediaImpressions Software pre-loaded on the camcorder and easy to useCons:Video quality very lacking when zoom is usedSound recording has some consistency issuesInternal batteryWhen using Zoom the sound is recorded on the videoOverall I have trouble recommending this product. At the price it would be great if everything performed as expected, but with the issues it has it's just not the best choice out there.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent Hardware, Lousy Software", "Author": "N. Burlakoff", "ReviewID": "R1FB5NMNDMOYTU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera itself seems quite reasonable considering the price. The feel and balance are excellent. The quality of video images are fine, although using the zoom does create noise. The zoom itself is slow,which is not a bad thing since most amateurs tend to zoom too fast, cut-away too often, and not pan on a tripod--all techniques that jar the viewer. I have not had the camera long enough to test its durability and waterproof qualities, but there is no reason to suspect problems there. The hardware seems to be of decent quality.But the downfall of the camera are a lack of adequate printed information/web support and ArcSoft Software. I had some serious reservations purchasing the product when I learned that the packaged software was by ArcSoft. A number of years ago I had some very unhappy experiences with that brand when I purchase a printer with bundled ArcSoft. But then I reasoned, this was a few years ago, the company is Philips a respected European giant ...Wrong! Clunky, aggressive, software that tries to worm itself into every nook of your computer. A true pain to install and an even greater pain to remove from a PC. In all, it took four tries, and almost a full day to install it so it would work. Of course there was no phone or web support listed either by ArcSoft of Philips. And then, mediocre image control.Fortunately, I bought a used camera and am not as irritated as I would be had I paid full price. I don't discourage folk from buying this camera, but I do suggest that they buy it used, and then purchase a better software package such as Roxio or Photoshop. Too bad, really.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall good, with some great and some bad...", "Author": "eyecore", "ReviewID": "R1G7VJVPO2689F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using a Kodak PlaySport (Zx3) HD Waterproof Pocket Video Camera (Black) (there is a new version of it, but I have not used it.)  So in addition to the what makes this Philips unit worth getting, I'll also be comparing it to the Kodak version.Out of the box, this Philips version is very attractive, a fair weight (not lightweight, but not too heavy to be a burden), and feels overall like good quality.  After some quick charging (note:  the quick start and the manual are basically picture stories and mostly useless), I went through some options and started playing.First thing, the ability to zoom while taking a video is pretty nice.  However, the auto-focus is pretty slow when you're doing that, so if your goal is to zoom real quick to get a picture of a sports player running or something, you're most likely to get a blur.  If you don't use zoom, once things are focused, it seems to remain there fairly well.  Taking still pictures gives you the choice between 5MP and 8MP...neither of which are going to be taking pictures that you race home to print out pictures to frame.  The color saturation of the still photos was lacking - then again, if you wanted a still photo camera more than video, you probably wouldn't be looking at this camera.Next, the flash works surprisingly well for still pictures.  As long as you're close to the subject you want to take a picture of, it'll illuminate enough to get the picture.  Though the angle of the flash is limited (make sure you center your subject), at least it works.For the video, the ability to record a hi-rez video and a low-rez one (for emailing) is handy.  The video quality is sharp, but my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35 12.1MP Digital Camera (new version available but I don't have it) has considerably better video color than both this and the Kodak.  The Panasonic is only 720p rather than the 1080p here, but that's not best indicator of picture quality.With that said, here are some annoyances with this camera:1.  For memory expansion, it uses MicroSD.  Rather than standard SD which everyone in the world has a few extra, you'll get to buy a smaller version of it.  (The Kodak camera I mentioned earlier uses the regular SD card.)2.  The button to take a picture is actually that black thing in the middle of the 4 red buttons in the middle.  It's one of the multi-stage buttons, but the location and pressure you have to exert to use the button is bad.  You need to press it hard enough that, if taking a still picture, you will likely move the camera at the same time.  (The Kodak is better here, too.)3.  The audio on the video sounds like there is a blanket or something muffling the mic.  (Kodak is slightly better here.)4.  The battery is built in, and one of the few things the instructions say, is to NOT replace it yourself.  The Kodak wins here overwhelmingly - it has a removable battery.  (The newer version of the Kodaks, however, also have a built-in battery.  Must be an across-the-board attempt to make less consumer-oriented products so the companies can make more money.)The good with this Philips:1.  Dual video qualities with one video.  You don't have to always take the best quality and then bump it down with Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD or similiar software.2.  The menu options, once you're used to them, are good.3.  The optical zoom, despite a lowered image quality and the auto-focus taking too long.Overall, if given the choice, I'd likely stick with my existing Kodak for two main reasons:  removable/replaceable battery, and it uses a normal sized SD card.  The Philips is ever-so-slightly shorter and about the same width.  Of course, if I was the type to get new electronics when the \"latest/greatest\" thing arrived  and I already had some micro SD memory cards hanging around, the choice wouldn't be quite as easy.Also, for the record if you're planning on hooking this up to your Windshield Camera Mount to make a car-cam, this device (and the Kodak) both do an admirable job, and can both record while being plugged in...so your record time limit is your memory card.Good camera, but for my personal tastes and existing accessories, a newer Kodak may be more tempting.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera except for the Battery life", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R12M5DGOGUF5PM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera takes great pictures even in very low light, without using its weak flash.

I ove the ability to be at the pool (in the pool) or at the beach and not have to worry about the camra getting wet and the ability to get shots that you otherwise would not. I also have a GE model (for only $100) and love it. I was hoping the better MP of the Philips and the flash would lead me to have a good replacement for the 5mp flashless GE camera. Unfortunately, I was wrong and this will be considered a backup.As a video camera, the Philips does great. However, it falls short in several areas.1. It needs a micro-sd memory card instead of the more standard, and preferred for me, SD card. The micro SD cardd was hard to get in and out, and the SD card is much better.2. The flash is awful. IF totally washes out still pictures and is useless. It can provide additional light for video, but I would avoid it for still shots.3. The GE camera I have takes pictures WHILE recording video. This is the best feature of that camera, and one that I will definitely look for in any waterproof camera I get. The Philips is lacking this feature.As far as build, the camera is nicely made and does feel comfortable in the hand.While the Philips is a nice camera, you can do a lot better with a different camera and spend a lot less money.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "fairly weak, all things considered", "Author": "bored99", "ReviewID": "R34AQGDNGZIXGP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros:* Easy to use* Works just fine in the snow* Works fairly well underwater, but be aware that dim light levels will make many pictures a bit grainy* Drop-proof (it was sent inside a larger box with only 1 of those plastic \"pillow\" things when 6 would have fit, so presumably it was thumped repeatedly during shipment, and seems to work just fine* Small and light - smaller than a box of matches* Has a place to screw in a tripodNeutral:* Outdoor (sunlit) image quality is decent, not great* Videos seem to be choppy (but I'm putting that in neutral since it's possible it requires a more-beefy PC... although videos from other cameras work just fine on this PC)Cons:* That tiny little latch that protects the memory card and USB connections is easy to bump, which means you might open your camera underwater (which is how I ruined this camera just a couple of months after getting it - ouch!). My more expensive underwater camera requires you to open two latches before it will fly open, so that extra bit of protection makes a big difference* Indoor picture quality is bad (super grainy)* Underwater picture quality is poor (grainy)... and that typical digital-camera delay can be really frustrating when you're underwater (where it's far more difficult to stay still than it is on land!)* Zoomed video quality is awful (even more grainy, details indistinguishable... is the zoom maybe digital rather than optical? yes, it's that bad)* Internal battery - which means that when your battery runs out, you're DONE until you have time to recharge it* Internal memory is laughable - will hold only 4 pictures* Uses a micro SD card (the kind that are smaller than your fingernail), which may require a separate purchase (currently about $25), and can be annoying to work with--you have to slide it into that tiny spot, and if it hits the spring before it's in all the way, it will pop out, do several flips in the air, and land on the floor. Took me about 8 tries to get the darn thing in* For some reason, its pictures aren't very compatible with Microsoft's file explorer ... if you're just browsing these on your desktop, and choose to rotate a picture, it tells you that doing so can cause the image to lose quality, so you have to use a separate photo editing program even for super-simple things like rotating an image 90 degreesThis was admittedly a lot less expensive than my Panasonic DMC-TS3, but, um, wow. I was thinking I could let my husband use this one, but after seeing how it performs it's probably better for my 7-year-old :-/  It could be fun to play with when I'm just wanting some fun underwater

and sports very good usability features like navigation, dual recording formats (optional), MP4 video format, and 3 second pre & post record (optional).  It comes with a USB cable, cloth bag, 2 hour built-in battery (charged by USB), pictograph manual, and optional software.  It doesn't come with a memory card which you must buy, but this is normal until you get into 3X the price and cards are relatively cheap. With its clear outdoors focus, it works good outdoors to point & shoot video, but not poor indoors.There is a more detailed manual available on the manufacturers Philips site if you search for the model, CAM150RD.  However, neither manuals or FAQ offer guidance on what grade of Micro SD card you must buy.  My other HD camcorder stated that class 10 was required to keep up with the write rate of HD video.  Some class 10 cards offer even higher speeds than the 10 Mbps minimum required to be class 10, and can support even 20 or 30 Mbps.  It depends on the HD video write speed needed.  My other camcorder's manual had documented the write speed of all video quality settings.  This manual or online FAQs makes no statement on write speeds.  So I assume it means it doesn't matter for this device.  I still assume some sort of basic class 10 speed would be needed for HD video, so I advise at least buying a basic class 10.  8GB should be sufficient for 2 hours on this camcorder's format and file sizes.  I personally bought the PNY 16 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card P-SDU16G10-EFS2, and it works great with this camera.The audio quality is fine, but requires special holding by the rubber on the sides without touching the front cover.  When my hand was on the front cover, not even near the mic, audio would cut in and out and sound windy inside and was downright unacceptable until I realized I was holding it wrong.  Hold it like a phone camera.  The photo quality was okay, but for the 8 MP stated, I expected more.  My 10 yr old 3 MP seems better.  Indoor quality isn't very good with or without the flash, but is serviceable in a pinch, and better outdoors.  Video quality was a mixed bag.  Video indoors was unacceptable and grainy and flash only makes it worse.  The color accuracy and lighting was way off.  But tolerable if better than nothing.  Video outdoors was much better or very good, vibrant, crisp, and accurate colors & lighting.  Zoom is almost unusable as it results in only grainy images the more you zoom.  Just point & shoot.  Image stabilization was excellent when standing still, but more jittery and jumpy when you pan the camera, but the \"Sports HD\" mode helps.

I've been a still-photo hobbyist using both film and digital cameras for many years.*I picked up the CAM150RD to use as a simple and informal camcorder. I want to see if I enjoy making videos and learn about the video camera workflow.*Since this is my first video camera, I'm not too concerned about having full control over all aspects of the image and camera. Point-and-shoot is enough for me at the moment.What I like*Camera is compact, light, and feels well constructed.*Waterproof to 3 meters/10 feet.*Simple to use, most functions are controlled by a 4-way joypad*Picture quality is good on a 1080p LCD TV, although not up to Blu-Ray standards. Images can look a little soft at times and purple fringing is sometimes visible during transitions from darker to lighter areas of a scene.*The lens and image sensor are sensitive enough to shoot in ambient light in most situations.What I don't like*No viewfinder. Call me old school, but I prefer framing shots through a viewfinder. Peering at a screen at arm's length just doesn't feel natural to me. It's also difficult to pan smoothly when holding the camera with an extended arm.*Screen has low resolution and washes out easily, especially outdoors. This often makes it difficult to see if a shot is going to come out the way you want.*Auto-focus doesn't work well when zoomed all the way in on distant subjects and there is no way to manually focus the lens.*The battery is neither removable nor user-replaceable. This means you cannot bring extra batteries on a long shoot.*The camcorder charges slowly over USB and an AC wall charger is not included as an accessory.Other notes*Mac owners don't need to install any software. Apple's iMovie HD reads memory cards formatted by the camcorder without any problems and supports a direct connection via USB (I use an i7 iMac with System 10.6.8 and iMovie HD 6.0.3).*When setting up the camera for its first use, the date must be input in European format (dd/mm/yy).*There is not enough built-in memory for immediate out-of-the-box use. I decided to try the AmazonBasics 16 GB microSDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card. This memory card works well, providing more than 4 hours of HD video storage and almost 16 hours of standard-definition video storage.Bottom line*Despite some shortcomings that are common to most point-and-shoot cameras, the CAM150RD is a fun and easy to use camcorder. If you're just starting out with videos, as I am, or want a rugged and basic camera to play around with, the CAM150RD is a fine choice. Four stars, keeping in mind that dedicated or serious videographers probably will want something more sophisticated.------Update (December 2012): no problems to report after several months of occasional use, other than to reiterate that this camera does not focus on distant subjects well.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "disappointing, will update as use more", "Author": "B.

The indoor video I took of my son's music concert, in admittedly relatively low-light (but nowhere near dark) was nearly unwatchable.  The focus was terrible and the output was super grainy.  My wife, sitting right next to me and thus experiencing the exact same environment, taped the show using our Kodak playsport and it came out absolutely wonderful, well worth sending out to family members.  There was simply no comparison between the two.  While the sound quality was a closer match, I'd still give the nod to the Kodak over the Phillips.  The still photos in the same situation came out just as bad, also grainy, also often blurry, and often washed-out as well.  I tried both video and stills at various levels of zoom--without a zoom the quality of both was noticeably better, but still poor quality.  I then took stills out in a well-lit hallway and again was disappointed in the quality and again, the Kodak completely outmatched the Phillips.I've used it in outdoor conditions and better lit conditions and there's no doubt the picture quality is better in those conditions, but in all of them it comes in quite below the Kodak in quality.Other issues:The zoom was very slow to auto-focus and took several long seconds before settling in.the choice of a micro-SD. Not only is it annoyingly different, which I could live with, but it really took some force to get it into the slot. In fact, the first time I used it I left it sticking partway out assuming it was a clever design that shutting the cover would put the card into the slot as it needed to go. This did work--the card obviously slipped in and had no issues--but then, when I needed to connect it to the computer to download, which necessitates leaving the cover open for the cable, I realized what I had thought was a clever design wasn't purposeful, as I needed to get the card all the way in.  I eventually used a pen cap to push it in, wincing at the pressure needed to do so. (I won't discuss the times it popped out and I had to search on the floor/desk for it).it has its pluses, but to be honest, since its primary purpose is taking good pictures and video, and so far it hasn't, I don't see the point in outlining the good points which are so secondary to its primary objective.I'll use it a few more times to ensure this review is a fair one, but there is no way I will do so at special events or without using the Kodak as backup (or one of my point-and-shoots which also shoot far better video based on the samples so far--two Canon elphs and our larger Canon IS).

The dark cherry housing is distinctive without being flashy.  The non-removable battery charges through a USB cable with a camera-attachment end (not a standard connection but one that I have for another camera, so it's not proprietary), and it charges fairly quickly.  The controls are mostly intuitive and easy-to-use, although, due to the waterproof housing, the buttons are not sensitive and must be pressed firmly.  Philips has included a flash, something you don't often see in pocket camcorders, let alone waterproof ones.  This works great for low-light interior and underwater video, although its range isn't far and you'll find that people may be reluctant to look at the camera.  The camera offers a one-touch button to switch between video and still camera.The camera shoots in full 1080p video and 8MP stills, but here is where the camera falters.  The resolution of images doesn't matter if the optics, focus, and firmware are not top-rate, and unfortunately, especially with still shots, the Philips doesn't always deliver high-quality images.  My iPhone takes better stills than this camera does, primarily because the Philips requires you to firmly press a button in the center of the camera, and it almost impossible to hold it still.  I got more blurry stills than good shots.  The HD video is comparable to other pocket HD camcorders.  The zoom is awful -- sluggish and without the same sharp video you get without it.  The sound is comparable to others such as the Flip, but you need to hold the camera at the bottom to avoid covering the microphone slots near the lens.The camera uses micro SD cards, and one is NOT included in the package, a real pain.  I had to order AmazonBasics 8 GB microSDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card with SD Adapter before I could film more than 10 seconds.  Because Flip cameras have internal memory and Kodak cameras include memory cards, I was quite shocked to discover that the camera was unusable without this additional purchase.  The meager internal memory is used for a feature that records a few seconds prior to your pushing the button; I guess it constantly writes over images when it is turned on.Mac Users:  the software on the camera does not work with the Mac OS, although iPhoto imports the video with no problem.  Usually, the programs that comes with cameras like this aren't all that great, so I doubt I'm missing anything.If you want an outdoor camera in all-weather conditions and to use underwater, the Philips is a good option.  You might also want to compare to Kodak PlaySport (Zx3) HD Waterproof Pocket Video Camera, another good but not perfect option.  Skip the Kodak PlayFull Waterproof Video Camera unless these two cameras are out of your price range.

But having to buy storage is typical for every camera I have bought in the past few years, so Philips shouldn't be knocked for that.  The menu is very easy to navigate using toggle buttons on the back of the unit.  The camera has several built-in video features such as B&W;, Sepia, 70's old film, and color filter.  Another button allows you to choose between flash modes, HD/standard resolution, photo size, numerous scene modes (auto, skin, snow/beach, night, backlight, sunset, and underwater), smile detect mode, microphone on/off, and others.  A toggle button on the right side of the camera above the power button allows you to quickly switch between video and still frame modes.  All of these buttons and functions are very easy to get to.

Morgan", "ReviewID": "R2RD7L5MJAPXVZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Philips is a household name when it comes to electronics and this was my first opportunity to play with their camcorder/camera line. This camera was initially very disappointing but after giving it a second chance I have come to appreciate it more. I am completely revising this review.This is an attractive little camera, wine red and compact. It is a little smaller than an ice cream sandwich, which makes it ideal for on-the-go imaging and also for people who dislike toting a heavier camera around. Because this camera is waterproof it feels ruggedized and solid, and the camera is able to withstand being dropped from low heights. Overall, it is a well-built product.I plugged in the camera and I let it charge, and it took about an hour to fully charge. This was a pleasant surprise - other brands of cameras I have used take 2-4 hours so Philips has the charging mechanism down fairly well.My first big disappointment happened when I set up for recording. By default, the camcorder is set for HD recording and it reported that I had about 15 seconds of recording. When I started recording, it stopped shortly thereafter. Sure enough, it ate up all the space available. It was at this point I realized that there was no MicroSD card in the package - not even a small one. I had to dig online to find the internal capacity of the camera - 128MB. A camcorder that cannot record even 1 minute of video is all but useless. This was evidence of simply cutting corners. Granted, I could set recording to standard resolution and I could get more video time but still not enough to be considered useful. Why Philips does not include more internal storage in this camera is completely beyond me.My initial video tests were abyssmal. I tried several things to get the video quality up but I was unable to get things to look very good. Videos were grainy, pixelated and otherwise looked bad. I tried setting the recording mode (scene) manually and while that did help it did not improve the video quality enough to make a real difference. I moved the video to the computer and it looked even worse.It occurred to me that all of my videos were shot in the evening with lower light. I decided to take a video of my cat in the middle of the day instead and the results were vastly better, to the point of actually looking quite good! So, I set the mode to \"Auto\" and recorded about 30 seconds worth of footage, copied the video to the computer and everything looked great. Apparently, the low-light capabilities of this camcorder are not great but it's daylight recording is very good.The anti-shake capabilities on this camcorder are excellent. There seems to be a slight filming delay which allows the camcorder to compensate for slight motion - this is good for when you're outside and you have a shiver.Still image quality is good when using good lighting but is average at best when in low-light conditions. With the small internal storage there is room for pictures but again this will fill up fairly quickly, especially at full resolution.I had high hopes for this camcorder/camera and though I was initially very disappointed with it I have come to a point of satisfaction with it. It does not perform well in low light, even with the flash on, but in daylight it is very good. The storage capacity (or, rather, the lack thereof) really is inexcusable but for an on-the-go camera/camcorder it's worth a look. As long as this is not going to be a night-life camera, it's good.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cute", "Author": "Simon Cleveland \"S.
