{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great 'beater' camera to take where you won't take your 'good' one", "Author": "Mike in Columbus, GA", "ReviewID": "R3T2KR5HCWVKL3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take with me when I don't want to risk damaging my dslr.  The camera works fine for outdoor shots and is great for the occasional dunk in the pool or using when boating or at the beach.  This would not be a good choice to take scuba diving, but could probably withstand shallow snorkelling adventures as long as you limit the under water time per the instructions.  I will use this camera mostly white water rafting and bicycling trips when sudden summer showers tend to soak everything on the bike (I have a water-resistant cell phone for the same reason).I would not recommend this to use as a primary camera where high quality photography is the top priority.  This is a great little 'beater' camera to take with you to places that you won't take your 'good' camera.  When you are on that white water rafting trip, you won't miss that once-in-a-lifetime snapshot of Bigfoot hiding behind the flying saucer because your dslr is back in the hotel room staying safe and dry.Pros:Inexpensive - I purchased mine at a local big box store for less than it takes to fill my compact car with a tank of gas.Good picture quality - you won't confuse the photos with ones taken with a good dslr, but way better than expected for the price.Compact - this camera is easy to carry in a pocket.  The best photos come from the camera that you have WITH you.MicroSD card adapter is included and works well.USB cable is included to upload photos if your computer's card reader has trouble reading XD or microSDOptical Zoom - many cameras in this price range just have digital zoomDigital Image Stabilization - the anti-shake mode helps for situations where camera shake is a problemGood Olympus website support including downloadable .pdf manual for the cameraCons:The camera only has an XD card slot.  the XDs are pricey and perform slowly compared to SD.The microSD adapter has a tab that is not on a standard XD card.  It does not work directly in the XD slot on my computer.This is not one of the Stylus Tough series, so it is not shockproof.Low light performance is only on par with other cameras in this price range.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great overall value, and waterproof", "Author": "GeekStuffDiggit \"DJ\"", "ReviewID": "R3PYYVGIKZPU6J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a refurbished model of this camera prior to vacationing to Hawaii. After reading some other reviews about the camera not being waterproof, I took a backup disposable underwater camera, and kept a cheap memory card in the Olympus just in case it flooded. It did not. I was able to take great underwater pictures at Hanauma Bay (including a baby green sea turtle that I swam with for about 10 minutes!), as well as great pictures out of the water.Pros: underwater capability, high image quality (10 megapixel), variable flash modes, excellent rechargeable batteryCons: ease of use, long time between shots (about 3 seconds), image stabilizationNo leaking, no flooding, no problems with this camera.My only complaints about the camera design are the difficulty with changing modes so that you can vary the flash mode, the image quality type, and panorama mode. The camera comes with ridiculously brief printed instructions, so you have to use the included CD to find the real instruction manual. Camera shake is a problem with this, and I suspect most ultraportable cameras, and I'm disappointed that Olympus did not include an electronic image stabilization feature (similar to Sony's) to help deal with the inevitable camera shake.As mentioned above, don't get in a hurry taking pictures one after the other with this camera. It does take about 3 seconds in between pictures.That having been said, I'm thrilled with the overall quality of the pictures we took, both underwater and out of the water. The camera's portability was great, in that I could literally carry it in my pocket and have a 10 megapixel camera at the ready during any part of the trip. I bought a \"Body Glove\" case with strap for the camera, made of a Spandex-like material that fit closely around the camera and worked great.Based on my experience, this is a great little camera for your snorkeling trip. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not as advertised", "Author": "AlexR", "ReviewID": "RJ690N3MXVIAU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is NOT waterproof. Given, upon contact with water, water doesn't flood the camera, but it leaks into the computer plug and the battery-and-memory-card compartments. The water cannot make it all of the way in, but it eventually vaporizes and 1)Fogs up the camera lens so that it is IMPOSSIBLE to take any pictures, and 2)Covers the display and leaves PERMANENT marks on it. The result is that I have spent many days(even weeks), leaving the camera open to dry.The camera also has horrible light-detection and is usually grainy. If I had known what this camera was like, I never would have even touched it and I pity all who have purchased it. In fact, my camera was so incredibly bad, I cannot believe that Olympus actually put it on the market. I have hope that Olympus sold me a defective product and if anyone else had a different experience, let me know. If not, I will be sure never to get another Olympus camera.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Abysmal", "Author": "A.B", "ReviewID": "R2PN1GRZRV0KNT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is by far the worst camera i have ever used.  Every single shot i have taken is incredibly grainy. The scale of quality goes from 'Kind of Grainy' to 'Oh i think i've seen this magic-eye before!'.

The pictures of the beach and butterfly conservatory turned out great.  I didn't have as much success with the night time shots or fast moving objects but that's only because I'm used to a very fast camera that I really know.  I only had a few days to practice with this before vacation.

I really hope you DO NOT to buy this camera!! Every time I take a picture without a flash, the picture turns out SUPER blurry. When you replay a video you took, you can't hear any noise unless you download it to your computer. It is good for underwater, but it also is very blurry, however I haven't tried using the flash underwater because I was to frustrated to even fool around with it. The camera is so complicated and i hate it! Now whenever I take a picture with the camera there are black lines going across the screen and I've tried every setting possible. It also doesn't turn on half of the time, the power button turns orange and the screen stays black. If you turned the camera on, then turned it off, then tried to turn it on 20 seconds later, it would just sit there dumbly, not doing anything. You have to wait atleast 6 minutes to turn it back on again. the screen is super tiny and the buttons are too small and complicated. You are better off using a cheap camera that you bought from a grocery store, than this load of trash. This annoying camera has caused me a lot of stress and I have only had it for 6 months! Any re-usable camera should last someone atleast a year or two!! PLEASE make a good decision, and learn from my  mistake. In other words SPEND YOUR MONEY WISELY (NOT ON THIS CAMERA!!!!) I am so angry that I waited until now to test the camera out because I am going on a vacation next week and I just realized that I'm not going to be able to take a single picture unless I want to look at the screen and see a bunch of lines going through my picture. Also who has enough money lying around these days to go buy themselves a nice camera? NOT EVERYONE! So if you've saved up some money for a new camera you should buy ANY camera except for this one! This has to be the worst, cheapest (quality-wise), stupidest, ugliest camera ON EARTH! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!! I wish I had somebody to tell me not to buy this camera so I really hope this review helps you pick out a BETTER camera than this!", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Olympus 10 Megapixel Waterproof 3X Optical Zoom Digital Camera Red", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516%2BDE4jLWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003NTYARY"}}
