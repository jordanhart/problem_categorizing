Great seller!", "Author": "Bigtoona", "ReviewID": "RWBI795BT13U2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Though Hurricane \"Sandy\" slowed things down a bit in transit, shipping prompt and packaging was superb.  The Imaging World did a great job.  I couldn't be more satisfied with their service.This was a fantastic package with a camera that takes great pictures and video.  We love it -- especially as new grandparents.  We can inflict those high quality images of our grandson on anyone at a moments notice!I noticed that one review complained of a 30 second video limit before the camera automatically shut off.  I found the same thing....and then noted that I had put in a slow SD card.  The class 10 card that came with this package was just the ticket and allowed me to shoot high quality video without a problem.  The slower card can still be used for hi-resolution stills.I would not hesitate to deal with \"The Imaging World\" again, and I would certainly recommend the Canon T3i!", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera.", "Author": "Patrick K Whitmore", "ReviewID": "R3JEQE2QXVGGCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it for my wife and she loves it.
