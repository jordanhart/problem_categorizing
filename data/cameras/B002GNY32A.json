With four cameras, we can see everything we need to, and cover the outbuildings on our property. Easy to install-my hubby and I had it up and running in about an hour, wiring and all. You just have to learn the remote, read the manual, and set each camera according to individual need, and let it record. It's user-friendly,it does the job VERY adequately, and I would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "Easy-to-use, plug-&-play digital video recorder with 4 outdoor cameras and cables\nCameras have IR night vision up to 30 ft & are 400 TVL with 6mm lenses\nPre-installed SATA 320 GB Hard Drive for extended recording\nAdvanced MJPEG compression\nTriplex operation", "Name": "SWANN SW343-DPM 4-Channel Digital Video Recorder with 320 GB Hard Drive and 4 Cameras", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AEvjyZr8L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002GNY32A"}}
