Grandma could operate it - just a few buttons.It'll display from it's memory, or from a USB stick or card (and probably other things I haven't used).  With a couple buttons, you can copy the images from the USB etc. to the memory.It shows pictures in order by date modified, or random.  If you just load pics from the camera card, this will be perfect.If you edit images, you have to find some software to fix (reset) the date modified, if you want the photos in order.  There is a lot of freeware to do this.  Alternatively, you can download Kodak's free software to create slideshows - it sets the date to today, and then increments the time.  This works great for an individual slideshow - but not so good for adding things to the frame.But, if you just add new pictures as you shoot them, they'll stay in order.If you want a bunch of fancy options (music, video, etc) or want to be able to scroll around on the frame and select groups of pictures, those features are not on this frame.But personally, I'll deal with creating slideshows on the computer, and putting them on a stick.Did I mention, the color and photo quality is absolutely GEORGOUS?", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Finally -- a toaster!", "Author": "P.

Finally, an electronic gadget that's like a toaster ... you just plug it in and it works!!

Not just for it's very reasonable price but because it was supposed to be \"a toaster\" as in you plug it in and it works.. well that's exactly what it is. It's so easy to use! Thank goodness! I was scared it would be a hassle but we've found it just as easy as it has been touted.  You plug it in, put a flash drive in and the pictures are showing up beautifully. Vibrant pictures.  I have complete control I can just watch the slide show or I can freeze the frame or I can shuffle the pictures.. I can insert my camera memory right into the frame without having to use a flash drive if I want.  it's very simple.  If friends have pics to share with me they can just bring over a flash drive or their memory cards and it's wonderful!  I would recommend this for anyone young and old.  Whether they are computer savvy or not it is so easy anyone could do it.

The only complaint I got is that the frame starts the slideshow from picture 1 upon power-on instead of the picture it was on at the previous shutdown.

I did the usual: read lots of reviews, did lots of research. In the end I chose this Kodak EasyShare P725 Digital Frame although it was, I believe, a fairly new release.The frame was a birthday present for my friend, and I wanted her to be able to see pictures on it right away. This EasyShare plays pictures directly from the frame, or from a memory card or a USB flash drive. I chose pictures that I thought she'd like and spent a happy afternoon organizing them onto a SanDisk Cruzer, so she could enjoy the frame while selecting her own pictures. The picture quality is crisp and bright, and there is none of that \"funhouse mirror\" distortion that you sometimes get when the picture isn't the right shape for the frame. I knew my friend wouldn't be happy seeing herself and her family egg-shaped!If there is one thing about this product that could have been better, it's the user guide that came in the package. But the online extended user guide and support is excellent, so it was only a minor drawback. The directions suggested checking for software, firmware and driver downloads. Note that there are no downloads available at this time for Windows 7, so that could possibly be an issue for users who run that OS (as my friend and I both do). It wasn't an issue with this purchase since the drivers were up-to-date. There is EasyShare software available to be downloaded for free, to help with organizing, editing and uploading, but anyone who is satisfied with their current photo management software can pass it by.This gift was a big success and so far has performed very well. Isn't it satisfying when you have a great idea for a present and your research pays off, and the recipient totally enjoys it? This digital frame would put a smile on anyone's face.Linda Bulger, 2010", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak digital frame", "Author": "Ankit Srivastava", "ReviewID": "R343179JXMV669", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This picture quality of this digital frame is very good. Only problem I faced with is while copying the pictures from my memory stick to its 512MB internal memory. U can only copy one picture at a time and that too is very slow.

Griffin", "ReviewID": "R1CYF3FQKBQMI7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The picture quality is beautiful.  That is my nice comment.  Otherwise, I really hated this frame...I am sincerely disappointed with it, as I felt Kodak would be a sure bet.  The frame is much smaller than I envisioned, but I suppose that is my fault for not measuring better.  There was no USB cable to hook directly to my computer to load the pics.  I ended up having to do it by putting pics on a sandisk and copying to the frame...which took all of 7 hours for 800 pics....cannot imagine trying it with the \"4000\" that it holds.  It balked when I tried to do all 800 at once, so I had to do them in batches of 100.  The frame starts at the first picture in the slideshow sequence every time you turn it off and on, so you never will see the last picture if you have very many on there.  The instructions are vague to say the least, and I waited on hold for over an hour on the online chat option and never did get any assistance.  I found the whole experience frustrating and downright riduculous.  It is a gift the night before Christmas so returning it is out, but when I go to buy my own or any other gifts, I can guarantee I will be looking elsewhere.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "not bad, pay attention: no USB or memory card comes with it", "Author": "A.

We had another digital photo frame that was larger, but returned it because the screen flickered. The Kodak frame is easy to load. If you add photos from your USB device or SD card from your camera, it automatically resizes them, taking say, a 4 MB file down to 150 kb so the frame will hold more photos. The picture quality is excellent. The colors are vibrant and the images are crisp. You can display photos for 60, 10 or 5 seconds. My chief beef with the frame is that when using the 10 or 5 second settings, you get something like the Ken Burns effect. For those shorter time settings, the frame doesn't automatically center horizontal shots that are not cropped to a good shape for the frame. Portrait style or vertical photos are fine. But if you have a horizontal shot that is too large for the frame, it might show one small part of the photo, the upper left corner say. So the frame doesn't have options that let you turn off the Ken Burns effect when using the shorter times.

Why is this bad? Because they wanted to bring it to the senior center to show friends photos on it and thought it was too complicated to have to find an electrical outlet in the cafeteria.. Otherwise, let me say that the picture quality is great, considering the price especially. Setup was easy - my father figured it out in less than 15 minutes, I'd say. I think it's a pretty good product, but do admit that it would be cooler if it was battery-powered.

My one problem with its looks is the fact that the cable included is of a different color to the frame, it looks odd seeing a jet black frame, only to see a somewhat cream colored power cable sticking out of its rear.The actual image quality is fantastic. Images come to life as you turn the frame on. Colors are sharp and bright.Options are very limited. You're given a few choices on how to customize your slide show.

I love how it is set up, VERY easy to use, simply plug it in and push play.  I would recomend getting a seperate memory card to use with it as it doens't have much of it's own memory.  The cord plugs into the bottom of the frame and it sits up very nicly on it's own.

I transferred photos from our recent vacation to another card I bought specifically for this and it looks fantastic in every sense of the word.It's about as simple to operate as it gets, and the black frame goes well with practically any decor you've got in your room. You can set it to various types of slideshows or random, and chose for it to move along the photo as well, giving it a more dynamic view. And of course, if you have a favorite picture you just want to stare at all the time, you can always freeze it in place.The most amazing thing I found was that even when you view it from far away, the pictures are still easy to distinguish and see, unlike normal picture frames.If you or your relatives complain that printing pictures is a waste of money and that you never look at them anymore, this is really for you. You can just slip your memory card in and view it all easily from a beautiful frame and setting.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "A gift I didn't want to part with...", "Author": "Robert Nix \"bomfan\"", "ReviewID": "R1GAPKLH7PAG27", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this frame for my dad as a Christmas present.

The Kodak frame is simple to use and operate and has a good quality picture.  The actual picture size is roughly the same as a 4x6 inch print.

Copying 320MB to the internal memory took well over an hour - more like 2 hours. All of the pictures are 800x600 so there isn't much resizing going on - just the vertical pics.[update] It boots in a minute or 2 with an older MMC. The lesson here is Do Not use the internal memory !!Pretty picture for its size & price but it sucks to use. A lot. If this is Kodaks' standard for the 21st century then I forsee they'll end up in the tar pit when the 20th century momentum of their brand name runs out.Nice pictures (for the price), if a little soft, but a terrible user experience.

It is a comment on the service I received from Amazon after the USPS failed to deliver the product, a gift that I ordered to be sent directly to my brother in O'Fallon (formerly St. Charles), Missouri.I chose \"Super Saver Shipping\" with an estimated delivery date of 12/18, one day before my brother's birthday. The frame shipped quickly and actually arrived at the St. Charles postal facility on 12/14. It remained there, apparently untouched, until after Christmas, before being sent back to the shipper in Phoenix, AZ, with no attempt at delivery.Why? Until several years ago, my brother's address was St. Charles. He has not moved, nor has his street address changed, but after some zoning changes his \"city\" address is now O'Fallon. I had mistakenly used an address on file at Amazon that still gave it as St. Charles. I would think the St. Charles post office could have easily figured out the error and made the delivery anyway, but they did not.So my brother did not receive his frame. Were I to point fingers, I'd say either I was to blame or the post office. It was Amazon, however, who came to the rescue.After I contacted them about the problem (having noticed on the tracking data that the parcel was suddenly leaving Missouri and heading for Arizona), they volunteered to ship a replacement order, no extra charge, to the correct address right away. And they used UPS one-day delivery.I've had my share of bad consumer experiences, but this was a refreshing change of pace.
