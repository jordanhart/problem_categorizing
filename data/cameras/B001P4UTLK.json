It was easy to setup and can now view live video on my phone or any of my PC's.I use this camera mainly to view wildlife behind my house. I have motion detector flood lights that light up the area at night, so I normally don't need the Moonlight Mode, although it does work great in low light.The attached video was taken at night without using the Moonlight Mode. I'll attach another video showing what a video looks like with Moonlight Mode turned on.This is an amazing camera and has a very sharp picture. I do wish it had an external mic jack like my SCNC2601. The audio is much louder and more sensitive when using an external mic. An external mic jack is on my wish list for the next smart phone supported model. :-)Comparing this camera to my SCNC2601, I would say the SCNC2606 has a sharper picture but I do like the SCNC2601 for it's Pan and Tilt capabilities and its external mic and speaker jacks. Both are great cameras and work great locally or over the internet.", "Date": "February 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "More features than I would have ever expected!", "Author": "NM", "ReviewID": "R17POHL7GZSCIN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\" was never more true in this case. I wanted a camera of higher quality than your typical web-cam, so while I was scrolling through the results of \"wireless cam\" I initially missed this one due to it's visual similarity to webcams. But then I saw how highly it was rated and decided to try it. After owning the cam for over a month, I could _not_ be more impressed! It has all the features I was looking for and then some. Most importantly, onboard continuous loop recording to a SD card (or to remote servers), uploading of images to a remote server when motion is detected, and password protected web access (both through [...] or through active streaming using a viewer such as VLC).The other reviews have covered most things that can be said, so I'll only try to fill in a few more blanks. The quality of the picture is excellent for the price. However, the moonlight mode does (understandably) drop the fps, yet unfortunately it still didn't quite have the sensitivity I had hoped for. There is a street light outside of my home, and although I can see fine with my eyes, the picture is completely dark even in moonlight mode. That's not too much of a problem though since the night-vision version is more appropriate for that use anyway.Here's a quick run-down of all the settings available, since I don't think they are documented very well in the detailed specs:Camera Setup: - Light frequency - Image rotation - Moonlight mode on/off - Power (activity) LED on/off - Show FPS - Mic on/offStream Setup: - Independent Primary/Secondary/Mobile stream image size/framerate/quality settingsOSD Setup: - On Screen Display (overlayed on video) configurationWireless Setup: - Infrastructure or AdHoc modes - WEP, WPA, and WPA2TCP/IP Setup: - DNS settings - Configurable ports - Basic or Digest Access AuthenticationPPoE Setup: - PPPoE dial-up on/offDDNS Setup: - Service, host name, username, passwordUPNP Setup - Universal PlugAndPlay Enable/disableAlarm Setup - Motion Detection (up to 4 configurable zones of sensitivity) - Schedule Setup (configurable alarm schedules) - Alarm Management (FTP/email/[...] of snapshots when the alarm is triggered) - Periodic Sending (FTP/email/[...] of customizable timed periodic snapshots)Alarm Server Setup (configure FTP/email/[...] servers)SD card Function Setup: - Record on alarm on/off - Snapshot on alarm on/off - Continuous record on/off (and this does truly loop, deleting oldest files to make room for new ones) - Snapshot at interval on/off - SD card FTP sending on/off - Browse SD card - Format SD cardTools: - System identity - User management (can add login users, turn anonymous access on/off) - Date & Time (configure time servers) - Backup or Restore settings - Firmware Upgrade (can only be done by support)System Tab: - Shows SD card status/space, wireless strength, active users, etc.Although it's true as others have mentioned that there's no phone number for customer service, only email, they are incredibly responsive, and they truly know the product. You can expect a rapid reply that truly addresses your issue and not just canned unintelligent replies. If you buy this cam, be sure to contact them immediately, as they will download new firmware to your camera that fixes bugs and adds new features. This should be done right off the bat since the firmware overwrites your settings.For the money, I don't think you can go wrong with this wireless camera!", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Good Wireless Camera", "Author": "A.

Crocker", "ReviewID": "R32U06N0MELRPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching and trying other options for monitoring my newborn daughter's nursery, I chose the 2606 because it offers a wide variety of features for an affordable price. Combining a wide angle lens, a low light setting (be sure you enable the \"moonlight\" setting to get maximum performance), and several simultaneous streaming options including some with two-way audio, the 2606 is a very versatile camera. Unlike some other wireless IP cameras, the 2606 offers several levels of encryption including WPA2-PSK which was a huge selling factor for me. Another HUGE selling factor for me was the cross platform compatibility since my primary system is a Fedora Linux machine. One thing to note on this point is that the included software is Windows only but it's only used for the initial setup of the camera (really it just scans your network to determine the IP address of the camera). However, all you really need to know after you plug the camera in is what IP address was assigned to it. Once you know the IP address, all settings can be set through a web browser regardless of platform.  After installing the included software, simply plug the camera into your router and run the software and your camera will be automatically detected (again if you know how to determine the camera's IP address then you don't even have to install the software).  The camera also has built-in motion detection and alarming capabilities so you can be notified via several options such as e-mail whenever motion is detected in view of the camera.  If you're looking for a great wireless camera and you don't need total darkness vision (if you do check out the 2607), then the 2606 is a really nice camera which offers plenty of technology for a reasonable price.", "Date": "February 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "great multi-room nanny cam", "Author": "B. wang \"amazon mom\"", "ReviewID": "R1AB9MP1V63G8I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 3 sharx cameras to watch my new nanny. the set up is very easy, just read the enclosed user manual and follow the directions. within 15 mins i got the video image live on my home computer. the cameras are installed in living room, baby bed room and dining room. all 3 video can be seen in one control window. (i use the app called Multilive, which is included in the setup CD)i emailed the web addresses of the cameras to my friends, they tried it and everything worked well for them too.to watch the live video at my work though, is another story. my company has very good firewall, blocking pretty much every port. each of my cameras need an open port to work. port 80 is common for internet use, tried that first and it worked. if you experience the same difficulty watching the video from work, just try the following steps: in the camera setting screen, click network, then click UPNP. change the external HTTP/RTSP port range to 80 -- 80. for multiple cameras, you need to contact your IT department to see what other port numbers are available. try 8080 and 1755, they are common open ports.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing value, quality, and accessibility", "Author": "lh \"-lh-\"", "ReviewID": "R227758S228V4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say, you really won't understand how great this camera is unless you try other ones.  First off - this camera is 640x480!  There's one I saw her called \"DropCam\" that seemed cool.  But it's a 320x240 resolution camera AND you may have to pay per month!  I looked through a lot of IP cameras before deciding on this one.  Even though I've not owned other IP cameras, you can tell this is the best one just by researching.  I've not needed support but they seem to be responsive.This camera puts out 680x480 resolution.  Amazing quality!  I love that I can access on my laptop remotely through a web address (for free) and through my Palm Pre, or any other mobile phone with a good data plan.  One small gripe is that I can't get anything higher than a 176x144 resolution for your phone, but it's no biggie.  You can still see a great picture/video.Setup was easy.  Plug your camera into your router via ethernet cable.  Enter the IP address (determined by router) and enter admin for user and admin for password and you're in.  Change whatever settings you need but make sure you connect to your wireless network under \"wireless.\"  Let it search and enter the password and you're up and running.  (Follow instructions if any issues).  I got it up and running in 5 minutes.Even though it's an indoor camera I have it hanging outdoors under my roof to watch my driveway since we think people might be walking through to get to our backyard.Lastly, did I mention there's audio?!  Many other wireless IP cams don't even offer this.  You can adjust the volume remotely if you want to.  All settings are adjustable from wherever you are.  PLUS - all 2010 models now have a SD card option that will auto-record via motion detection and you can access controls/media remotely (i think you can delete content, etc all remotely so you don't need to pull out the card to do so).  Amazing.I'm really glad I got this camera.  It has great picture quality, many web features, and all at an amazing price.  I got it via Ebay through Secure Camera direct (although you can't tell it's them) and used Bing Cashback for 8%+ off depending on the special.  It's $229.xx minus cashback and then free shipping (no tax).  Awesome!****Update**** 02-24-2010I just had a support call because I wanted to see if I could get higher resolution on my Palm Pre.  They helped me to connect to another link where I was able to get 320 x 240 resolution on my phone.  It was so much clearer.  Love it.  They also said they would give me an outdoor version of this camera for the same price if I wanted it (it was just released) or if this camera ever  messed up b/c I have it outdoors, they'd replace it for me with the outdoor version.

They have one checking pool area, one checking the property and 2 in their shop. They are clear as a bell. They have the software setup so they can see all 4 at one time on a separate monitor. The latest firmware make them easy to setup. All 4 are wireless going to a netgear router. They have 2 computers with extra monitors and they both can see all. Early on with the old software they were a little confusing to setup but with the latest firmware they are a snap. They stay connected 98% of time. Once in awhile they stop and usually a reset of software cures it.  The customer support is probably one of the best I have seen, I deal with support in my job and I wish other companies were as go as they are. I had a slight problem with one camera and I sent it back and they fix it and returned it with latest updates both hardware and software. I can't say enough about their support.  The cameras are clear and the sound on them are also good. You could use them at your house for door security. I am going to install one so I can see and talk to anyone at the door.  The price of the cameras are a little on the expensive side but you get what you pay for. If you want quality and clearity this is a good choice.  I setup up the cameras for viewing on the net.

I would definitely not recommend trying to use motion sensing looking out a window.  Too many false alarms due to leaves moving, snow, rain, dust, etc..  Couldn't adjust the threshold and sensitivity enough before it would be blind to me walking right in front of it.  Don't know if there are better systems.Update:  I had a lot of problems with the camera early on, mostly due to a bad SSD card, but now that I've had it for a couple of years, I've worked out the bugs and it works great (other than false alarms if you point it outside).

I use it to \"tune in\" to see my 3 month old in her crib while I'm at work. As has been described here by other reviewers, the camera can be a bit of a challenge to set up, but if you follow the detailed instructions carefully, most people should be able to set it up with little or no problem. It would have taken me about 30 minutes to do it if my wifi network name had been one word instead of 3. Overall, it took me about an hour or so (and I have very limited experience with setting up network stuff like printers and wifi routers). As many others have noted, Sharx's customer service is very responsive. I emailed them a question after I set it up and got a response quickly.The camera's resolution/video quality is excellent, even in relatively low light. I can use my iPhone/iPad to see my baby anywhere in the world! A few caveats: 1) While I can use the camera with my macs (and set it up via mac), I cannot control some of its functions like zoom. For that, you need to use a PC. 2) My company restricts streaming video so I'm forced to use a proxy site whenever I want to use it from work. 3) Be careful if you use your iPhone/smartphone often: streaming video can increase your data usage costs pretty rapidly.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great quality and very easy setup", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R3VCDK581ZLGCX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been wanting to get security cameras for my house for years now.

Ultimately, I settled on several cameras from Sharx.CAMERA SELECTIONInitially I had a lot of confusion about which camera to get so I'll briefly list the different cameras and the main differences between them below:SCNC2606 Wifi Wireless Camera - This is an indoor wireless camera and probably the best option for most indoor applications.SCNC2607 Wifi Wireless Camera with Infrared Night Vision - Indoor wireless camera. This camera comes with infrared night vision, and is mainly designed to be used in low to dark environments.  It does not have as good daytime colors as the 2606.  It is not designed to be used outdoors, as it is not sealed, but if you use it in a covered environment like under a porch, and you do not have extremes in temperature and humidity, it might be acceptable as an outdoor camera. Be prepared for the possibility that using it outdoors will lead to rust and it may stop working though.SCNC2700 Wifi Wireless Camera with MicroSD DVR and True Day/Night vision - Indoor wireless camera with day and night vision.  If you need to be able to record in day and night, get this camera over the previous two.  The infrared filter cuts off during the day, so that it doesn't mute the colors, and then cuts on at night to allow video in total darkness.SCNC3606 Cat5 PoE Wired Weatherproof Outdoor Camera with Infrared Night Vision and built in DVR - This is an outdoor camera that requires a wired ethernet connection.  It is completely sealed so it will last directly in the elements.  It comes with PoE (power over ethernet) so it is useful in applications where you don't have close access to an outlet.  As of March 2012, it contains an updated lens that is sharper than the SCNC2606, SCNC2607 and SCNC2607WAdditionally, as of Fall 2011, the SCNC2700 and SCNC2700W contain an updated lens that is sharper.  The 3605 and 3606 received the updated lens in March 2012.  The SCNC2606, SCNC2607 and SCNC2607W will not receive the updated lens.INSTALLATION / CUSTOMER SUPPORTI would say I am an advanced computer user, and intermediate when it comes to working with routers. I thought setup was going to be difficult since I didn't really know what port forwarding, DHCP, or UPNP was, but it was incredibly easy. The instruction manual is extremely thorough and describes everything in detail.  This is one of the best and most comprehensive manuals I have received for a product.  They think of every question you could have.  Even if you have fairly basic tech skills, if you read the entire manual, you should have most of your questions answered.  I had the camera set up and recording in about 10 minutes, and had the complete installation done (including running the ethernet line) in an hour.  You can run it wirelessly, but I wanted faster transfer speeds through ethernet.  I really thought it was going to be a pain to have to deal with customer support through email but I couldn't have been happier.  They answered all my questions (which were numerous) within 24 hours and were willing to provide all the support I needed for my router.  They even notified me that one of the cameras I had ordered had been upgraded that weekend to a new 2012 model with a sharper lens, and allowed me to exchange my camera for the 2012 model, which they shipped out to me immediately (they covered shipping) without requiring that they receive my exchange first.  At a minimum, you are going to need to know the address to access your router's administration page (it will be a local numerical address, like 192.168.100.1), and the password to login to that page.  You can do a search on the Internet and easily find this information. Contact me through the comments page and I can help you if needed.  You will also need to know the login information for your wireless network.  I was initially going to purchase a much cheaper camera that I was told uses the exact same hardware as the Sharx, but I think the support you receive from this company is definitely worth the extra cost.  I do wish their web site had a forum where users could exchange information and get help from each other.SOFTWAREThe interface is very thorough if you use the advanced setup options, and gives you a lot of flexibility with the camera.  It comes with a CD, but the program on the CD is really just designed to determine the local IP address of the camera and isn't really needed if you can figure it out yourself (unless you are setting up more than one camera, in which case you'll want to use the Multi Camera software from the CD). Otherwise, everything is handled through your web browser with ActiveX.  I had to use Internet Explorer to get the full functionality for the camera, as some of the tools would not show up in Chrome and Firefox. I've added an image showing all the configuration options through the control panel.  There is a \"system\" page that displays all of the current information about your camera, including your local and wide area IP address, UPNP status, Internet connection status, MAC address, and many other variables. This screen is very useful for troubleshooting and setting up the camera.  Once you have your camera set up, you should turn on the On Screen Display so it captures the date and time on the video feed.  You can set up a Gmail account to have it email you images during alarms or just at specific intervals.You can even set up a dedicated Gmail account and have it send a picture to itself every 5 minutes indefinitely (or until you use up Gmail's storage space, at which point you can delete everything and start again).  There is a motion detector on the camera that works very well.  It allows you to set up to 4 different windows/areas for monitoring, all completely customizable with different settings. For instance, you can set up the entire viewable area to check for any motion, or you can set up a very time section of the screen to focus on the corner of your door, so it will only trigger an alarm when someone opens the door and it sees movement. For my indoor camera, I have a motion detector and alarm schedule set up so it will only be active while I'm at work.  It records all the time, but the motion sensor alarm cuts off during the hours I'm typically home so I don't set it off.  I wish you could set up different alarm schedules for each independent window for even more customization, but for right now, the software is pretty good as it is.DVR/MONITORINGThe main thing you will want, is a way to save your video feed to an external source.  If a criminal steals your camera (if you are saving to the SD card) or your desktop the video you saved to it of the crime won't do you much good when you don't have access to it.  Initially, I saved my video feed to an external hard drive that I mounted under my locked crawl space, and ran the cables to it through a small hole in my floor.  A knowledgeable thief could still delete the video file right from your desktop, but I think that's very unlikely.  To be extra safe, you could just password-protect your windows account so it locks after 15 minutes of inactivity.  Even better, I eventually just added a link to the camera on my office computer and set it to constantly record there.  Even if my house burns down, I'll have a copy of the video saved at a safe location.The Sharx instructions give you complete details for setting up the camera through your phone's web browser, but I found it to be a huge pain to do.  It is much easier to use a third party app.  The best Android app is TinyCam Monitor. This program works beautifully. The paid version gives you a few more options and allows you to record directly from the phone, but it's not necessary at all.HARDWAREThe SCNC2606 has an excellent build quality, although it's not quite as sturdy as their outdoor cameras since the housing is hard plastic rather than metal.  The bottom of the camera has a slot for a microSD card, giving you the option of recording directly to the card instead of a hard drive.  I have a 16GB card in my camera which will cover quite a bit of high quality video.UPDATESOne disadvantage with Sharx cameras is that you can only obtain firmware upgrades by contacting support, and having them install them remotely.  My camera came with the latest firmware installed, but I don't see how anyone would know when new firmware updates are released since I couldn't find anything about it on their web site.  Make sure you email them and get the latest firmware before you start setting everything up, because updating the firmware will reset everything.CONS- No Power over Ethernet (PoE), which would make this camera much easier to install.  I had to run the power adapter through the wall and into a bathroom, where it sticks out a bit.  Make sure that you have a socket available in the location you want the camera.- Form factor is boxy (about the size of two packs of cigarettes side by side), so it's a bit difficult to hide the camera if you don't want anyone to notice it.CONCLUSIONI am confident the intruder who broke into my house and walked around my house with one of my large knives will never be caught, which makes it all the more frustrating that I hadn't picked up a Sharx camera earlier. While they won't necessarily prevent a problem from happening (although no one is going to break into your house once they see that it's being monitored), I really think everyone should invest a few hundred dollars into video surveillance for their homes.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product but config is nightmare!", "Author": "E.

My system had issues before I ordered the camera. 99% of you will have an easier time setting this up.

It's a stable camera that gets the job done for the most part.  I own three, and plan to buy the outdoor version as well.Rather, I'll point out one con for those running Mac OS Lion server.  I tried to get this cam to record over SMB (that's the only option other than SD card) to a Mac Mini running Lion server.  This appears to be impossible due to the following (from the Mini's System log):'Jun 30 17:20:29 mini smbd[3450]: 10.x.x.x SMB client not supported - Unicode, NT Errors, Long Names and Extended Security are requiredBasically, the cam doesn't support SMB to the level that Lion requires.My plan was to have the cam save video and snapshots to a Dropbox folder so that they would be synced to my macs offsite.So, for now, the options appear to be:1. Enable FTP server on the Mini and save to a dropbox folder (but this seems only to support image upload).  This is working great.  To enable it, open Terminal.app and:a. Edit /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist and change Disabled to Enabled.b. sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist2. Use Evocam (which I've used for years) to save recordings to the Dropbox folder.  But the latest Evocam (4.11) crashes when setting up three networked cams.  I'm experimenting with distributing the cams across a couple macs...3. Buy an SD card and use the \"FTP Sending\" option to upload videos from the card to an FTP server (setup similarly to option 1).For now, I'm forced to use option 3 along with option 1.  Not the end of the world, but something folks should be aware of.ETA: Adding after further research...After some digging, it appears Apple replaced Samba with their own SMB implementation which does not support older SMB clients.A Samba-based SMB server for Lion is available that allowed me to record to a Lion Mac (though NOT to a Lion Server).  Google SMBup, and it's the first hit.  This is very easy to install (it's a self-contained app like any other mac app, and allows to install and remove the Samba-based SMB services).", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sharx 2606 is a Great Camera with Outstanding Cust.

The last time while setting up the first camera I didn't follow the manual's instructions; this time I found out how easy the installation is when you do.  Adding the second camera and using DNS hosting for this camera was a snap...the detailed instructions are included in the manual.  Both cameras are working flawlessly.  The 3rd party app I wanted to use with my iphone to view the camera wasn't working so the Sharx customer service folks sent me step by step setup instructions and got it working.  You will not find much better customer service than these guys.Update-3/6/2013- Just wanted to update my original review since I bought this camera and have used it constantly for 1 year. The Sharx 2606 still works flawlessly...no problems at all.  I use it to stream to WeatherUnderground and has been doing so for a year.  Over that year I did have to reboot it one time because the pictures stopped streaming, but that was it.  I can pull the video up from anywhere. This is a great product with super support.I read through all of the seller feedback on this camera.  From what I read I saw that the setup may be a challenge ( no network geek here) but the manual and customer service would make up for any problems that I may have, so I ordered the camera.It arrived on time and included was a very comprehensive manual. What struck me, and something I have NEVER seen on any other mail order merchandise is this sentence, highlighted in yellow on the manual: \"We pledge that we will not let you fail. Contact us with any questions, no matter how simple or how complicated.\"So I started the setup. I have a MAC and an Airport Extreme wireless router, but it is connected to a Siemens modem/router (that generates the IP addresses). This combo kind of threw all the scenarios in the manual out the window. I plugged the camera into the ethernet and my Airport. The problem was that I disconnected it too early. Need to keep it plugged in until you can get the network username/password entered. After awhile of not getting a wireless connection, I plugged it back in. After 20 minutes of no connection I emailed Sharx.  This was about 10:30 PM.  Within 15 minutes I had a 2 page detailed email on my modem/router setup and what I needed to do.  I left it plugged in and went to bed.The next morning, the camera power indicator was blinking telling me it was connected and waiting on me, so I finished setting up what I should have finished the night before by following their instructions from the email.  The camera came on line, I disconnected the ethernet and placed it where I wanted in the house.I asked them a couple more questions about setting up to send to an FTP server and they sent me a detailed step-by-step procedure within 10 minutes.The camera picture is very sharp and has a lot of features that unfortunately I can't use in the setup that I have it in now (weathercam).  The wi-fi range is about 25 feet to the nearest router and have had no problems with it's signal quality.It would be great if other companies shared Sharx's passion of providing a great product, good documentation and outstanding customer service.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great First Impression -Updated", "Author": "Elliott Light", "ReviewID": "RC8NFFZGCN93C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I purchased this camera, I contacted customer service for Sharx.  This was on a Saturday.  They don't have a phone number.  You start a conversation with them via email.  I asked a lot of questions because I'd had an unpleasant experience with another brand and was returning it.  I received several replies and asked several more questions.  All of the emails were polite, understandable and informative.  The representative even suggested that I didn't need to buy the more expensive 2607 model!  Very cool.  So, I bought the 2606.If I hadn't confused myself, the whole configuration would have taken less than 30 minutes.  (An email to customer service generated a response in 5 minutes that identified my error.)I could actually see an image about ten minutes after opening the box.  The image is really impressive.  To gain web access, you must \"fiddle\" a bit, but the instructions are clear enough that I believe most folks can follow them without any problems.I will not repeat the details of the other reviewers.  Time will tell how the camera holds up.  But my first impressions, the company and the product deserve 5 stars.UPDATE:January 30, 2011 -After 2 months of remote usage, I'm still giving this product 5 stars.  I am also very impressed with the assistance I have received from customer support.UPDATE:December 4, 2011I bought two more of these cameras.  My experience with the first installation (at my home) was a five minute exercise that was straight out of the documentation.The second installation was somewhat challenging.  I installed this camera at a business office.  After fussing with an old 2 wire dsl modem/router, I was a bit discourage.  However, Sharx support is responsive, knowledgable and patient.  I was given instructions on how to configure the router.  However, at the end of the day, the dsl modem was replaced and the camera installation was easily completed.I've read the \"nightmare\" installation comments.  Given my experience with camera 2, I would guess that some of the nightmares are caused by the networking equipment and not the camera.  A network that uses a router than is configured to use uPNP should be a relative easy installation.  A router than doesn't support uPNP or says it does but doesn't requires the user to become more familiar with the router than he or she might want.  Sharx support knows this stuff and can help translate it for the network newbee.Based on my experience, this is a product that I believe offers a great bang for the buck and that is supported by people that want their customers to be happy.elight50", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Easy to use for Non-Network Savy", "Author": "ajl1970 \"ajl1970\"", "ReviewID": "ROERGAWMJOOCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is fantastic.

Since then I've played around with other features and am discovering more of it's capabilities.  Besides the wireless mode, another feature that I've tried is remote viewing from anywhere there is the internet (hence almost everywhere in the world).  I also bought a Micro-SD card (highly recommended) for the camera (14.99 for 4GB) and like the ability of the camera to record pics onto the card either motion activated (loads of choices there also) or at regular intervals.  These pics can also be remotely viewed.  I also like the email feature that emails pics (again in my case motion activated) to an email account, again with loads of choices regarding how many, how many frames per second, etc. so as to not get thousands of pics on your email (I set up a gmail account specifically for this purpose; Sharx gives specific directions for setting it up in gmail so it will work, and it did the first time.

This camera exceeds my expectations, so much so that I'm going to get another for the outside of the property and maybe even another (the night vision one) for inside; after the initial setup adding cameras seems even easier.

I contacted their customer service before my decision to purchase to clarify some questions - they were extremely quick in their response and very knowledgeable too. They told me that if purchased from their website, the cameras would ship with the latest firmware. He also explained the new features that have been added with the new firmware (periodically transferring files from the sd card to an ftp server and clearing out the card for further recording was a key one).Why I purchased this camera - I did a lot of web research and narrowed it to this camera and a panasonic. I purchased the panosonic camera first since it had PTZ -unfortunately, I could only record on my PC with that camera's software - and when the recording was active, my PC would slow to a crawl (a fairly new PC with a quad core processor and plenty of RAM). Even viewing the camera using the software would slow down my PC (access through browser was okay).Therefore, I wanted a camera that could record directly to a microSD card to avoid having a PC tied up for recording. It does have a microphone and can do motion sensing - the description in Amazon does not provide in-depth details - talking to Sharx customer service before purchaing was very useful in this regard. I wish it had PTZ also but that was not a deal breaker for me - I was able to place the camera on top of a shelf to get a wide view of my room.This camera meets all my requirements - fantastic picture quality, very easy to setup, records to a microSD card. I am fairly tech savvy and am somewhat familiar with router setup - so setting up access from the internet using port forwarding was not an issue.

The recorded video would \"freeze\" every few seconds. I also tried recording to an SD card, with even worse results. Note that the settings I am using are half of the maximum supported settings (2048k bit rate) and still the quality leaves something to be desired.I emailed the vendor, who gave a quick response, and said that in order to record I should use 15 fps, otherwise the camera CPU could not keep up. The vendor stated something to the effect that \"it's a computer, and it can only do so much\". Additionally, when recording, the camera should not be doing any other functions (image capture, viewing, etc).I feel it is misleading to advertize a camera that is 30 fps, when in fact, it is impossible to capture video at that frame rate from the camera. I would have certainly paid a little more for a processor able to keep up with 30 fps.Still, the camera deserves some praise.

That in itself is not necessarily bad but it is a bit overpriced for your money.  Panasonic makes tilt/swivel models that are just as good at night vision and have far superior features.  I don't find the low light capabilities outstanding even in the moonlight mode.  In fact, moonlight mode is basically useless because when you turn it on, everything taken during the day is burned out and the image is horrible.  Not sure why they can't make the moonlight mode automatic when you turn it on so that it only slips into moonlight mode when it gets dark enough (without it affecting daylight mode).  Also, the view from this camera is very wide angle: too wide.  Sure, you can cover a lot of ground but with only 640 x 480 resolution, even people walking 50 feet from the camera are extremely small and not well defined.  Good luck trying to ID someone if this is going to be a security camera installation.  The unit works and was easy to set up, but my conclusion is you don't get much for your (lot of) money.UPDATE: I've basically written off Sharx cameras as viable surveillance cameras.  I recently got an Axis M1011-W to replace this Sharx unit because the Sharx unit recorded nothing but a blur in broad daylight when recording cars passing by on a private road at low speed.  The Sharx allows no control over exposure or shutter speed while the Axis camera is so loaded with features that you can select the actual shutter speed and gain (in dB) for your application, set different motion boxes/sensitivities for different parts of the day, etc.  The Axis camera is more difficult to set up due to the plethora of features but if you need flexibility and even better low light performance, get the Axis M1011-W instead of this Sharx.

Typically with products like this I usually end up thinking this isn't quite working right and then I start looking for a way around the products short comings. With this camera it has not happened... other than a few very minor issues.I've had the camera up and running for a couple days and it's performed exactly as I had hoped it would.  I have it setup to upload photos to a FTP/Website every thirty minutes or when the motion detection is triggered.  One of the things I really like about the FTP upload is that you can specify different file names and upload directories for the timed images vs those taken when there is motion.  This function has worked perfectly for me.I also have the camera setup to email me when there is motion.  It allows you to send to three different email addresses, include the image or not and set one of three resolutions for the images.  I use gmail for an SMTP server.  The gmail website explains how to configure the SMTP settings and lists two port numbers.  One port number worked the other did not.I also installed a SD card to save the images locally.  Again, I am saving stills at 30 minute increments and capturing 30 seconds of video with motion detection.  The video isn't exactly smooth but it's enough to do the job.When I was testing this on my home network I was able to get it to allocate an IP address so I could remotely access the camera from the internet.  It's nice that you can view the camera and also setup the camera using the remote connection.  However, when I set it up on my other network it didn't work correcly.  The other network is running through an Encore ENHWI-3GN3 router that is hooked up to the internet via a truconnect.com USB760 3G modem.  I suspect the problem is with this equipment and not the camera itself since i did have it working on a more traditional network.I have used it both wired and secure wireless modes without any problems.  I have not tested the wifi range of the camera yet.The software interface is simple and easy to understand.  I only had to look at the manual to understand the terminology used to describe the time duration of the capture and the number of images captured.The minor issues... it would be great to have a button in the software that would test the FTP and email functions.  Yes, the camera can be set to send a image every five seconds or so to make it happen but it would be nice to to this with a button click.  I would also be good to get some feedback as to if the FTP and email connections were working correctly.  Something like a \"test the settings\" button.The only other thing that would be really cool to have with this is some kind of verification that the email or FTP upload worked correctly.  Using a 3G modem with medium strength causes file transfer errors occasionally.  If the camera could be setup to verify the ftp transfer and email sending that would be awesome.Anyhow... a bit long-winded here but I am very happy with the camera.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best video quality I have seen!", "Author": "N.

Man am I glad I did; after reading a few of the Amazon reviews I placed my order, and received it quickly.  Setup wasn't cake, but I wouldn't say it was difficult either.  Because I was not familiar with the product or process it took me a while to go through all the settings, but that's because this camera is so feature-rich.Others have detailed the features and highlights of this camera, so I won't go into that detail.  I will say that the camera does what it should perfectly.  I love the fact that I can log into a website and see my camera feed in real-time; after setting it up, we left for the weekend to visit the parents.  I logged into the website to show them how it works and they were very impressed.I already have plans to add a couple of the SCNC2607 cameras for the infrared capabilities, and a couple more of the SCNC2606.  I do wish there was a pan/tilt/zoom feature; I know one of their models used to offer this, but can't seem to find it for sale.  Anyway, great camera with a great picture and super features...what else do you need?UPDATE 1/16/13: Still working perfectly.  Recently I swapped out my router and lost my settings, and I forgot how to set the camera back up.  A quick email to Sharx, and they replied same day and even followed up with a phone call to see if I had resolved the issue.  Their customer service is absolutely top notch, and that's the reason I'll continue to buy their products, even at the relatively much higher price than other cameras on the market.

I had no problems with the setup. I even had to go through two routers on the wireless to get to the internet.

The Sharx website has no support information but they respond very quickly to inquiries and seem willing to do anything to help you get up and running. They even upgraded my firmware remotely to give me functionality that didn't exist when I purchased my camera. I wouldn't recommend the IR version unless you intend to use it indoors as the IR lamps are too weak to illuminate more than 8 feet or so. I've seen complaints that people can't get audio on MAC's but if you use Quicktime instead of a web browser, you'll hear the audio just fine. I agree that the manual isn't organized very well, but all the information that I needed was there; Except for more details on which kind of SD card works with the unit.

This camera also adjusts quickly to changing light levels when viewing outdoor subjects. And for night time or low light conditions, the \"moonlight mode\" works amazingly well by increasing its light sensitivity.Besides streaming video, I use this camera to upload images at timed intervals to an ftp server for viewing them on a website, and that option works great.
