I was terribly afraid it would be quite complicated and hard to figure out.  It does come with what seemed to me to be a very big instruction book, but much of the camera's operation seems quite user-friendly and intuitive.  I was able to start taking pictures right away, and am pleased with how they have turned out.  Highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera at an awesome price!", "Author": "Lindsey H.", "ReviewID": "R2O8L5E41MF2TK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is my first Pentax, and so far it's been great.
