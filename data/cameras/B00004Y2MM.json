{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Olympus C-2100UZ: 35mm SLR user's \"switch\" digital camera", "Author": "M Snyder", "ReviewID": "R9FLLZRM7K5EZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you own fine 35mm and/or large-format cameras, and have toyed with the idea of trying digital, read on at your own risk. You may -- like me -- never pick up your Leica M4P or Canon F1 or Mamiya 645 systems again.Let me tell you the only negative about this camera first: The color correction of the CCD under low tungsten illumination and fluorescent lighting resembles Ektachrome 400, circa 1970.That's it. That's the only defect.You're going to love this camera. Many reviewers wish for a 3.3 megapixel chip, vs. the 2.1 mp chip in this 2100. The recent introduction of cameras with the same image stabilized 10x lens/2.1 mp CCD system from Canon and Sony suggests some rethinking among the manufacturers of these cameras. Simply put, the ability to fill frames with image trumps the cameras with 3.3mp CCDs and smaller zoom ranges. To accommodate those 3.3 mp CCDs, one needs a larger buffer memory...which means a longer write-time...which means either a slower-shooting camera or a greater battery drain, or both, to match the frame-to-frame shooting capability of this lens/CCD/buffer combination. It also means your storage media demands will escalate dramaticaly, as will your needs for imaging media. Add the image stabilization feature, which has some kind of gyro motor running all the time, and you'd end up with unacceptable battery drain, if your had a 3.3 mp CCD.This camera offers two displays -- one the traditional 1.8 inch \"TV\" display, and the other, an SLR-like eye-level display. At first, you'll be disappointed in the graininess of the eye-level display. And yet, you will be surprised at the speed with which you'll accommodate that.The camera offers a 35mm lover's range of creative control, plus features you'd never dream of finding in an SLR or rangefinder. You can select the ASA of the CCD's sensitivity -- 100 to 400 ASA. You can select white balance, although it's not great under low-light-level tungsten or fluorescent, as noted. You can -- now get this -- choose black-and-white or...SEPIA toned imaging. The latter is a magnificent trip back to the 1950s and 60s.But nothing matches this lens. It's the equivalent of a 38-380mm zoom lens. The image stabilization means that, if you carefully brace yourself, you will easily -- and I mean EASILY -- shoot 380mm hand-held shots at under 1/20th of a second. It's a razor-sharp lens.The image compression algorithm in this camera works extremely well. The standard \"HQ\" mode generates images of around 400k size, which means you get a whopping 128 images on a 64mb Smartmedia card. You can switch to the SHQ mode and get 45 images on a 64mb card, but for most images, you can't see the difference in an 8x10 print. The write-to-buffer/write-to-Smartmedia time increases, limiting your frame-to-frame shooting speed.If you half-depress the shutter release, locking the focus and exposure, you can capture great sports action shots. If you put the camera in a manual mode, you can shoot almost one shot a second in the HQ mode.Flash reach is astounding. I have easily shot perfectly exposed images in dark rooms at 30+ feet. Recycle time can be iffy -- I minimize it with a Digipower external battery pack that plugs into the AC adapter jack -- but the flash mode seems to generate more data, which takes more time to write to the buffer and then to the Smartmedia, which slows the shot-to-shot time.You can get through about 150 frames with a single charged set of 4 NiMH 1600ma batteries -- I can't imagine going anywhere with fewer than a single well-charged extra set. The camera will kill a fresh set of alkaline AAs in about 10-12 shots -- the deep drain of a digital camera is totally incompatible with this kind of service.The camera is light, well-balanced. Its controls fall under the fingers neatly. Viewfinder controls work well, but I could argue that controls for the manual focusing could be better placed under the left fingers, rather than under the right eye, forcing you to focus with the right thumb.I purchased a C-2040 for my 14-year-old daughter's middle school graduation, and with those two cameras, our family is now fully digital.Stop looking for a new digital camera -- you've found it.You will be tempted to use the different controls and shooting modes. The iESP (\"P\") setting works so well, for most shooting, you'll leave it there.The only kind of shooting you might wish for a 3.3 mp CCD is for scenics -- digital cameras don't handle fine detail as well as 35mm film. I'd prefer a metal camera to a plastic one, like the the $2000 Olympus E-10. But I tried that camera, and it's S-L-O-W by comparison to the C-2100, and lacks both the zoom range and the imaging stabilizing features of the C-2100.For frame-filling portraits, there simply isn't a better camera.", "Date": "June 30, 2001"}, {"Title": "Olympus C2100 Ultra Zoom", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1VAY87CRX5WS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I consider my self an amateur photograher.  I enjoy the simplicity of point and shoot but get frustrated with the limitations this imposes.  The C2100 does great in point and shoot mode, but lets you manualy control some or all of the exposure settings. Manual focus worked well in taking picutres of fish below the surface. If you want you can specify a standard ISO value. All exposure settings are displayed in the view finder or LCD and stored with your exposure so you can compare and tweek until the shot is perfect.  Even the flash brightness is adjustable.  I was surprised on how many features this camera has and how many were user adjustable.  The movie mode runs at 15 frames per second so it's a little jerky and the built microphone leaves a little to be desired.  It points off to the left side of the camera instead of forward (there is an optional microphone port). You can also record 4 second sound bytes with each still shot (a good way to keep brief notes). The camera has an action shot mode which did a good job in freezing birds in flight.  However setting up the camera for specific shots can be a little time consuming when you're first learning (I missed more than several shots at first).  If your're out for action shots you'll have to plan and setup ahead of your shot and there is a delay between \"click\" and \"shutter\".  You can reduce time between still shots by turning autofocus on continously (shortens battery life). The drive mode will do sequential shots. The time between shots is 0.5 to 0.67 seconds depending on resolution.  If you plan to use the movie mode or high resolution shots I would recommend getting a 64mb card (holds 128 exposures 1600x1200 in standard jpeg format). I was able to get about 80 exposures on one charge of the rechargable batteries that came with the camera (this included zooming and reviewing shots on the LCD).  The camera can drive a video out but the TV picture isn't a crisp as your PC monitor.  The camera comes with USB and Serial ports but only a cable for USB.  Downloading 60mb worth of pictures takes a long time over serial port.  The only complaint I had with this camera was that occasionaly (sun to dark shadow shots) the view through the viewfinder was to dark to properly frame the shot.  Adjusting the view finder brightness didn't help. Overall I'm very pleased with this camera.", "Date": "October 22, 2000"}, {"Title": "I have a lot of fun with the C-2100", "Author": "Mark N. \"Intrigueable\"", "ReviewID": "R2MNT6QG2I9UYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The C-2100 is said to be based on the C-2000/C2020 which have been praised for taking brilliant images. Yet the camera works and operates like the latest C-3000/C-3030 series with additional features like audio/video recording, fast continuous shootings, continuous digital zoom, fast USB downloads, etc. Plus the camera has unique features of its own such as TTL (through the lens) LCD viewfinder, 27x continuous zoom (10x optical + 2.7x digital), optical image stabilization, more dedicated button adjustments (so you don't have to roll through the menus), exposure lock button, full optical and digital zoom in movie mode, etc.The image stablization works effectively along the zoom range and I was able to take sharp-focus pictures at 27x zoom without the aid of a tripod (remember I am an amateur and my hands aren't as steady as the pros'). It's a lot of fun taking this camera around shooting nature, buildings, sports, or just those innoncent people who are minding their own business from half a block away!The C-2100 uses 4 ordinary AA batteries so should your rechargable batteries (which is included with a charger) die you can always grab those AA alkalines at a convenient store. The camera usually can run half a day (on and off) using the rechargable batteries during my outdoor shooting trips.To me, this camera is a lot of fun to use, and it provides excellent pictures too. I am satisfied, almost. I only wish Olympus simplify the menu system, put on a manual focus ring on the lens, include a lens tether and a carrying case.", "Date": "November 2, 2000"}, {"Title": "Outstanding camera, outstanding value", "Author": "Doug Briggs", "ReviewID": "R27VHY8VO0J98V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The description above covers the waterfront on this outstanding digital camera. Some of the features that make it my idea of the best buy are:1. An important feature to me is single-lens-reflex (SLR) viewing, in addition to the LCD viewer. For me, I've been composing pictures for decades through SLR viewers with the camera to my eye. I don't like holding a camera out and looking at a tiny LCD image. I can hold this Olympus steadier in the old conventional way and get faster, more accurate composition. For me, the LCD screen is for RE-viewing, not for viewing while shooting.2. Hefty 2.11 megapixel image. Double my old Sony (which I thought was just fine), and likely to capture everything I will need for the professional work I do. 8\" X 10\" printouts are beautiful.3. USB port connection. Absolutely essential. Serial port is way too slow. If your computer was made in the last four of five years it'll have a USB port.4. Must those of us who have grown up with f-stops and film speeds unlearn all that? Not with this camera. It has the same familiar settings, including ISO film equivalencies of 100, 200, and 400 - it just converts what we understand to what the camera understands.5. Exposure of 1/800 to 16 seconds in manual mode. That will cover any possible range of shooting I'll ever encounter.6. Outstanding and almost instantaneous autofocus. When you need to shoot you can't be waiting even a half-second (like some popular digitals make you do) for the camera to get a fix.7. Incredible 10x optical zoom, equal to a 38mm wide-angle to 380mm telephoto - I'll not need more than that range, ever.8. Image stabilization. An excellent feature, especially for those quick shots, for long-range telephoto hand-held shots and those in low light that need longer shutter-open time.9. Lightweight, about 21 ounces. And very well balanced, considering the great zoom lens.Consider getting the 64-meg Smartmedia memory card described at left --($). 8 megs will be sure to cramp your photo capacity. The whole thing: less than (#). That's not peanuts, but this is the most digital camera you'll find for anywhere near the money AND for the widest range of practical use. Perfect for photogs from novices to pros and you won't be craving to trade up anytime in the foreseeable future. You could easily spend ($) and not get beyond the practical features of this camera, and that price won't even get some of the critical features found here.After ordering your camera, go to ..., who wrote the Product Description at the top of this page, and sign up for their newsletter on digital photography. This stuff is different from shooting film (all on the plus side), and there are some things to learn if you really want to get the most out of this incredible technology.", "Date": "February 12, 2001"}, {"Title": "Bravo, Olympus -- this product is superb! (long review)", "Author": "A. Franke", "ReviewID": "R3GM861BKPK1L2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera about 6 months ago, but wanted to wait until I had real experience with it to review it. I am 95% thrilled with this product!Before I purchased I completed a very detailed feature/benefit analysis of this and four other advanced amateur products, including those made by Sony and Nikon, all within the same price range at the time. I was looking a camera with excellent picture quality, SLR-like image control (shutter priority, aperture priority, etc.), a powerful optical zoom lens, and a small footprint (as small as possible). Obviously with these requirements, there were some compromises - for example, this camera is larger than those with 3x optical zoom lenses, but among the 10x lenses at the time, it was the smallest. I decided on this camera because it had the best score on average of all my requirements, and because every single independent review that I read was excellent.For advanced amateurs, the camera is excellent, with different shutter priority, aperture priority, bulb, fully manual and fully automatic. You can bracket exposure, flash intensity - hold the shutter button down and it will take 3 or 5 rapid shots of the same subject with different settings - then you can view them and delete the ones that you don't want. For beginners, the camera might be a bit overkill, but it has a fully automatic mode, which makes it hard to take a bad picture - even in almost total darkness, believe it or not! (When dark, the camera emits a red light that's used to focus.)Olympus was one of the first companies to release the 128MB SmartMedia card, too, and it works flawlessly with the camera - and with my MP3 player - allowing me to store both music and photos on the came card - and use it interchangeably. There's no special formatting required, and the card retains the \"special feature\" (panoramic photos) that Olympus added to the card. (Just don't format the card or it will be lost!). The 128MB card and the included 8MB card were all I needed for a 10-day Caribbean cruise during which I took about 500 pictures.Originally I thought that 2.1 megapixels might not be enough where there are higher resolution cameras available. But I rarely even use the highest resolution of this camera. Normally I use the second highest (1280x960), which combined with an online photo service like ofoto.com (or probably shutterfly or Yahoo) produces exceptional, vivid prints up to 5x7. I use the highest resolution when I want to print 8x10's.The software with the camera allows you to \"instant fix\" your prints, too. This feature automatically balances the brightness and contrast. On bright days, photos taken with this camera usually don't even need to be fixed. But for some shots, this feature really brings the image to life. In one example, I took a picture of a skunk in my backyard at night in manual mode with the shutter set way too fast. When I viewed the shot on my screen it looked completely black. I ran it though \"instant fix\" and the image of the skunk was suddenly plain to see - though it looked like a black and white shot, I couldn't believe the detail that came from what I thought was a lost image!On the down side: The camera has frozen on me a couple of times for no apparent reason. A couple of times I've needed to remove the batteries to get the camera to reset properly. This doesn't happen often enough to make it too much of a bother, though. Also, the viewfinder is digital (not optical), so it's still difficult to get a good focus sometimes. (When manually focusing, the image in the viewfinder doubles in size, which makes it a bit easier, but still it's not as easy as an SLR.) Also, I wish there was a focus ring on the lens like on SLRs - the hardware interface for focusing and aperture setting takes some getting used to. Automatic focus works very well, though.The camera came with four high-capacity batteries and a charger. You'll want to get an extra set of batteries, too. Though the camera uses batteries slower than I expected, it always seems to run out when you least expect it. Unfortunately the camera doesn't give much warning when it's about to run out of juice. The charge indicator will go from \"fully charged\" to \"empty\" and blinking in a matter of minutes.If you're an advanced amateur who likes exceptional picture quality and exposure control, plus lots of other cool features (too many to list), then you'll love this camera. When I studied these cameras, it was the best there was without taking the step up to true digital SLRs. If you're a novice, you'll find many features you don't use or don't need. You'll still like the fully automatic mode, though. And if you don't use the zoom a lot, you'll find the camera more bulky that your typical point-and-shoot. (The zoom, by the way, is exceptional - 10x optical with 2.6x digital - a total of 26x zoom, it's like having a telescope on your camera!)I hope this review helps you in your decision!", "Date": "July 13, 2001"}, {"Title": "NINE OUT OF TEN U-2 SPYPLANE PILOTS AGREE....", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R32MEWJC45FGWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "....This is ONE AWESOME CAMERA!I am a relatively new digital camera user, so if I can figure out how to use the menu, the display, and the controls, anybody can.  The body of the camera is very sturdy in its build, unlike many other models where you sort of expect the battery latch or the flash to break off from over use.  The 10X zoom lens really does live up to its billing, and the 2.1 megapixel resolution, while it is not as high as the resolution in many new models, is remarkably clear and sharp, especially for a user of entry level 460 X 640 cameras.  The camera is packed with manual overrides and even sound recording and video recording features!  The camera has an excellent USB download feature, and the photoediting software package, which includes Camedia, PhotoSuite III, and VideoWave III is good as well.On the downside, there are a few problems.  First, the camera sucks up batteries like a vampire sucks blood.  Olympus very considerately includes NiMh rechargeable batteries and a recharger pack with the camera, and this goes some way towards alleviating the problem.  Even so, you will be going back to the recharger early and often.Second, I agree with the other reviewers.  They really need a tethered lens cap.Third, this camera needs a case.Fourth, the 8 MB SmartMedia card that came with the camera is only good for either 15 exposures or a 24 second clip.  If you want to get maximum mileage out of the camera without frequent trips to a laptop or PC for downloading (which is really, really annoying) you must get bigger cards (the maximum size is 64 MB).  BEWARE!  If you do not buy a card from Olympus, the camera will make you run some insane reformatting program.Don't let these criticisms throw you.

Menu and controls are very easy to use - spend 1/2 hour with the manual and you'll be ready to go. Great battery life - I've shot about 100 pictures and a dozen video clips using the LCD display and I'm still on my original charge. This camera has the option of continuous focus - I usually lock the focus (1/2 press of shutter) at athletic events and then take the picture when the action happens.  I had been concerned about slow response times of digital cameras (vs. traditional), but this camera works great in capturing the action when I want. Overall, I'm very happy with this camera.

Its ability to zoom from 35mm to over 1000mm (35mm film equivalent) makes this camera worth the price alone! The image stabilization that is also a part of this camera is an added bonus. Most other digital cameras in this price range zoom up to only about 200mm (35mm equivalent) and do not allow for multiple shots.For those of you who are considering a digital camera that goes beyond \"point-and-shoot\" and has the ability to go in aperture-priority or shutter-priority mode, the C-2100 fills the bill. I do a lot of sports photography and am finding that the C-2100 does a good job. My only additional advice is to buy a 64mb SmartMedia card (the 8mb card that comes with it is insufficient) and a reader for your SmartMedia card that you can connect via USB to your PC.

I've agonized for almost a year on this.  Being a manual SLR enthusiast for more years than I care to remember, going digital was a big decision.  After taking Seattle vacation images on an entry level digicam, I was hooked.  I pestered camera shop owners, scanned the Web, magnified film, 3.3 digital and 2.1 digital images in 8x10 format. I finally decided on my first choice, the Olympus C-2100.  My decision was partially based on magazine articles stating that this model was used by some medium-format professionals as their \"test\" camera.  While I agree that 3.3 might make a better 11x14, I found no difference at the \"atomic\" level between 3.3 & 2.1 mp for an 8x10 printed photo, which is the largest I ever print.  If I should ever want larger, I'll use my Pentax SLR.  Photography is my passion, not my profession.  About the camera.  Let me point out the negative:  The 8mb card.  Don't use it.  It's almost funny.  If you're going digital, expect some expense.  Get the 64 or 128.  So much for the bad.  That's it.  As I anticipated, I am ecstatic.  I have found n-o-t-h-i-n-g that matches this 10x aspherical lens with IMAGE STABILIZATION at this price!  I've tried taking bad shots, but it's not easy...this machine only wants to do right!  And that's just the programmed mode.  You just have to try the aperture-preferred, shutter-preferred, scene program, and MANUAL.  If that's not enough, you will play with the sepia and black and white modes for nostalgia!  At the price I paid, which is hundreds less than a year ago, it might be my last toy...  Armed with the included 1600 rated rechargeables, I took loads of photos in the back yard, Waikiki, flower farms, and scenics.  Dumped unwanted images, took more, gave up counting, downloaded, and the original batteries are STILL going!  If you use alkalines, this machine will drain them like a vampire; fifteen photos and they are deceased.  It may not be the norm, but the shot-to-write time ratio for the Smartmedia card appears to be much  shorter with the 2.1 mp CCD, which may be why energy could be distributed more efficiently to the image stabilization feature.  USB cable and provided Camedia software are excellent; Adobe Photodeluxe even fixed \"b-a-d\" images.  This camera caters to SLR lovers.  If you want tiny, and if you want one to put in your pocket or purse, look to the C-700 instead, if you still want 10x zoom.  It just doesn't have image stabilization.  The C-2100 cradles readily into the hands like an SLR, but without the tonnage.  Olympus even positioned the strap so it would counterbalance the feature item:  The massive lens barrel housing.  That way, the lens doesn't droop down looking at your feet.  I've taken about twenty night shots, available artificial light, NO TRIPOD (even though I usually use one).  Sharp, facial-stubble clarity, stunning color quality.  If you don't have one, you might invest in a CD burner and CD RW's for all the pictures you'll take.

Taking the place of my JVC DVM70U, Canon S100 & Olympus Camedia 700 (all of which I like), the 2100 had a lot of big shoes to fill. First of all, I bought it for the 27x zoom, which from the sidelines is absolutely necessary to get into the action, and for its built-in stabilization system, the lack of which made long range zoom shots frequently blurry in the JVC & Camedia 700. I bought an extra set of batteries, a nice, leather Olympus case and a 128 meg SmartMedia card.I spent about 2 hours with the fairly complicated and not too well written manual before gametime. I pretty much had decided to leave the camera in its 'sports setting\" for my first night,  which is accessible easily through the thumbwheel control knob atop the camera body (though this requires a little time in the setup menu, which I found pretty intuitive).Well, 48 plus minutes later I had shot 83 pics at a medium resolution (1024 x 768), and about 12 30 second QuickTime movies at low resolution (320 x 240). There was still a ton of room left on the 128 meg card, and the batteries were still juiced!The camera was easy to operate, easy to hold and the new electronic viewfinder is about as nice as it gets. The zoom was fine as frog's hair.When I got home, I installed the nice software package and connected the camera via the USB cable (supplied). Downloading took about 5 minutes (BTW, I ordered a SmartMedia FlashPath reader, but you-know-who didn't get it here on time, despite the overnight shipping charge...but I digress) and playback was a cinch. All in all, the photo quality was very good, though I think I can do better at freezing the action than the so-called \"sports program\" did. The QuickTime movies, even at the lower of the two resolutions available, were magnificent; they were better than the JVC digital camcorder and the sound was really high quality.Now this is no point and shoot, but if you have a little time and interest, I think the 2100 represents a great multipurpose digicam.", "Date": "September 22, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great Digital Camera", "Author": "\"leebeverly645\"", "ReviewID": "R3J85FF5EXFP61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been into SLR 35mm photography for over 30 years and just entered into the digital arena.

The optical zoom to 380 mm gives great results and I think that this is largely due to the stabilization.  One of the strengths of a digital camera is that if in doubt you go ahead and take the picture because you can always erase it.  I've taken quite a few pictures that I would have never tried because of motion and been very impressed with the clarity.  When the zoom is pushed between 380 mm and 1000 mm the quality drops so my impression is that this is really a 380 mm lens that crops to make the picture sized for 1000 mm.  The manual is not clear on this.  Still, the zoom is impressive as are the multitude of options.  If you are interested in a digital zoom camera I don't think that you could do better.  If you don't care about the zoom then you probably should get a cheaper camera with slightly better resolution.

This camera is my 3rd digital camera, and is  a must buy if you are interested in a camera with a powerful zoom lens with a lot of features.  After reading professional reviews, I almost didn't buy it, but am now glad that I did.  The low scores in many reviews were more attibuted to the price for a 2 megapixel camera, [price], when it first came out.  I just paid [price]at compUSA- by far the cheapest anywhere on earth.  It is just a 2 megapixel camera, but I think that there is too much emphasis on megapixels in reviews.  What really counts is a good quality photo which this camera produces.  Most printers today can not even begin to take advantage of the 4 and 5 megapixel cameras unless you are planning on printing a lot of pictures larger than 8X10.  (unless you are willing to spend [price] or [price]for a professional printer)It's just plain overkill!  I have printed from 4X6 to 8X10 and have been very pleased with the results.  I printed comparative shots between my 3.3 megapixel (with very little zoom) and this 2 megapixel, and this Olympus produced better photos in color detail and saturation.  What you will get is unbelievable pictures that you were previosly unable to capture by virtue of a 10X zoom.  I have an HP 1315 photo printer.

A few things that may be considered negative:  is a little complicated to learn, but there is just so much you can do.  I also don't like that I have to reset the date and clock each time I change the batteries.  The 8 mb card that comes with the camera is a joke.  Buy a 128 mb card right away, they are cheap.  I also prefer to use a seperate card reader for loading photos into the computer, it is much faster than going through the camera and does not use any battery power.

The pictures are impressive - 2.1MP is enough for me and unless you are making huge enlargements, it is good enough for you. The reason I decided to write this review was because of an accident with the camera. I was holding it in one hand and my son ran by accidentally catching the strap and knocking it to the concrete sidewalk we were standing on. Of course I freaked. The battery cover popped off and the lens hit so hard it cracked a UV filter I had screwed into the lens. I thought it was scrap because it REALLY hit the ground hard.

I had read reviews about this camera in 2 different magazines in the same month (March/01) and these magazines did nothing but say great things about this camera.  10 other cameras were reviewd including the new Coolpix and 2 of Sony's, it stated that the Olympus C-2100 was the best and if could only have been 3.1 Megapixels it would've been unbeatable.  So I went out and bought this, and I love it!  I have been taking beautiful pictures with stunnig image quality.  I can't even see why anyone would ever need a 3.1 megapixel camera unless your wanting to blow your picutes up to Poster size or something.  The 10x zoom is of course the greatest feature, and I'm glad it has a smartcard instead of floppy disks like some of Sony's.  Floppy disks are not dependable at all, I am a tech support rep for a computer company and you don't really want to save much on a floppy disk.  I understand that smartcards don't last forever either, but the way floppies are made;  you could lose your pictures at any time.  But this Olympus camera is a beauty, it has so many modes and options that you could take just about any type of picture.  The only thing I don't like is the Panoramic mode, but oh well.  I don't really see using the video and sound function when it only records a few seconds, especially if you have a camcorder already.  But this is an awesome camera that produces stunning images.

After being a hobbyist manual SLR user for many, many moons, I took my first digital images in Seattle with an entry-level digicam, and loved it.  I then made a commitment toward it, which meant research and saving bucks.  My quandry was, do I go for 3+ megapixels with 3-5x optical zoom, or 2+ megapixels with 10x zoom?  I do agree with the idea that more megapixels would give me better 11x14, but I NEVER print images larger than 8x10.  I use my Pentax for those.  Photography is my passion, not my profession.  After months of examining 8x10 images from our film cameras, and comparing them under extreme magnification with 8x10 digital imaging, my mind was made up, and went with my first choice, the Olympus C-2100.  I was not disappointed.  In fact, I am thrilled.  My decision was partly due to reading in several magazine how some medium-format professionals use this model as their test camera.  Armed with their included rechargeables, I took photos in the back yard, Waikiki, flower nurseries, and scenics.  Took more, gave up counting, downloaded, and the original batteries are STILL going.  Alkalines melt like butter in a hot pan.  Due to the 2.1 mp CCD, write time to the Smartmedia card is astonishingly fast.  By the way, get the 64mb or 128mb.  Using the included 8 mb card is almost funny.  This baby caters to SLR lovers.  It almost cradles in your hands.  If you want tiny, if you want something to stick in your pocket or purse, look at the C-700.  The neckstrap for the 2100 balances the camera so that the main feature, the massive lens barrel housing, doesn't drop over (cool).  Oh, speaking about the lens...I found n-o-t-h-i-n-g that even comes CLOSE to this lens on a camera this small and in this price range.  To have an aspherical 10x optical (38-380 mm, 35mm comp.) with LENS STABILIZER opens up enormous opportunities formerly lost.  I can actually gamble and take shots without fear of bad images, even hand-held, artificial-light street scenes at 9 pm!  Throw the bad ones out...no film to develop.  If that weren't enough, the camera's menu has so many options to keep anyone happy.  Programmed mode, aperture or shutter preferred, scene-program, and MANUAL.  The sepia and black and white mode will take you on nostalgic trips.  Downloading for me is fast via their software, and Adobe Photodeluxe fixes even some b-a-d images.

It the first digital camera I have purchased.  Before buying I compared it with Sony, Nikon, and Canon.  I had never heard of Olympus until I saw this camera at Wal Mart.  I was looking for a camera that I could use up close to take photos of jewelry that I hand make.  I was looking for a camera that I could focus up close to show off fine detail.  According to the information I had read the C2100 can focus in 10 power as close as 3 inches from the subject.  The C2100 was the only camera at the time in that price range that had that capability.  The only problem that I found is that with SHQ setting you do start seeing individual pixel points if you try to expand the picture too great.  However for showing on a 25 inch TV monitor it still shows a very sharp picture, more than what I would need to show off my jewelry.  The camera is very easy to handle, and I seldom use a tripod.  I have taken photos using the full 10 power zoom and can usually steady myself against a pole or car top and get a great shot.  With a set of freshly charged batteries I can shoot most of the day before have to change batteries.  I usually carry an extra set of batteries with me so I can go a full day and fill up a 128 meg card without a battery change.  The biggest problem is finding new memory cards for the camera.  It uses Smart Memory cards, and the largest available it 128 meg.  Because Smart Memory is no longer the medium of choice for cameras of memory the cards are difficult to obtain.  Also the cards will bend and break if you don't handle them properly.  That has not been a problem for me and I have used the same cards since I first purchased the camera.  The camera originally came with an 8 meg card.  I immediately pruchased two 32 meg cards with the camera and also a 128 meg card that I found at Wal Mart.  That gives me enough to last a couple days before uploading to me computer.  I currently own two more digital camera's, a Olymput E VOlt 410 SLR, and a Pentax Kx SLR.

The extreme range of the zoom lens made it very versatile, and the image stablization feature enabled her to take it into a variety of settings where tripods were not allowed and she came away with beautiful, handheld shots.After a couple of weeks of shooting with my new camera I've found it to be everything she said it was.  It's versatile, light, sturdy enough for serious use, and it takes WONDERFUL pictures.  The controls are very intuitive. You have all the control of shutter speed, aperture, and focus options of a manual camera but with the added benefit of several automatic modes.  I'm not so fond of the menu-oriented approach to giving you these options, but I think with practice this won't seem so cumbersome.  I'd have preferred a shorter focal length on the wide angle side, but just love the long zoom.
