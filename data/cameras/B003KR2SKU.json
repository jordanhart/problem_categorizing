fun outdoors while taking pictures. It:- is waterproof to 10 ft. under water, perfect for swimming pools, beach, snorkeling (note: do not use in hot water!)- is shockproof up to 3 ft., great for jogging, cycling, or even letting your baby learn to take pictures- is freezeproof down to 14 degrees Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius)- is dustproof- has 12.2 effective megapixels- has 5x optical zoom and features a Fujinon lens for great clarity; lens focal length is 36-180mm in 35mm film camera terms- takes 720p widescreen, VGA or QVGA video- can zoom optically in video mode (but see note on audio recording below)- is really small and weighs just a little over 5 oz. with battery and SDHC card- uses SDHC memory card, no more xD that was championed by Fuji and OlympusI bought a green XP10 because I love spending time in the water. I find that, outdoors during the day, the XP10 takes pictures with excellent clarity and excellent color saturation and contrast. Using fill-in flash in daylight truly enhances the picture. Indoors, because the XP10 lacks Fuji's legendary SuperCCD technology, picture quality is average for a compact or super-compact camera. It does have two natural-scene modes where it boosts the ISO (light sensitivity of the image sensor) at the expense of increased noise. I bought my XP10 to be used outdoors, in the pool and at the beach, so I haven't taken many indoor pics.Video shooting at 720p yields smooth, clear HD video clips. BTW, video size is limited only by the 2GB FAT32 file size limit -- this means even if you pop in a 16GB SDHC card, the longest video clip can only go up to 2GB in file size, due to the limit imposed by the FAT32 file system. Video is recorded as motion JPEG in an AVI container, so it can be played on many, many devices, at the expense of slightly larger file sizes than a more compact format like MPEG-2 or MPEG-4.While you can zoom optically -- a feature that every digital camera should have -- audio recording's volume level is lowered during zooming. Instead, the camera picks up some noise from the lens mechanism and that noise overwhelms the ambient sounds you want to record, which can be annoying when played back on a large TV. My advise is to use zooming sparingly during video mode. If you want great video recording on a compact digital camera, you should get a Sony or Canon or Panasonic camera (be prepared to pay a lot more for the waterproof feature, though).Anyway, my sample video clip shows how the camera works under water. The video resolution was set to QVGA (320x240) for easy upload to Amazon, but you should be able to see the amazing clarity both in and out of water.In summary, the XP10 is a great waterproof, shockproof camera that every water enthusiast should bring along to record fun memories.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Touted As Waterproof; Warranty Says Otherwise....", "Author": "Joy", "ReviewID": "R2Z1R4V6RGI7SJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Took the Fuji XP10 out twice; once camping at Lake Tahoe and again at Kern River. The Fuji functioned well on the first outting, but started developing problems on the latter camping trip: moisture started developing in the lens area, causing photos to appear foggy. The display became disrupted, as the moisture that permeated the camera began to make it's way through the housing.I sent the Fuji XP10 back to Fuji in hopes of getting it replaced, but received an invoice stating, \"Water damage in camera not covered under warranty.\"Um, no kidding.The invoice also requested a payment of approximately $118 for an exchange of the same camera, with $100 of the cost going towards \"labor\"... Labor for what?!?! That's like buying a new XP10 with a little over a $20 discount over what I paid originally!What's the point of marketing a \"waterproof\" camera, when it's not really waterproof and Fuji won't even honor the warranty to make things right? It would serve Fuji well to learn from other companies that unconditionally back the products that they sell, like Pelican Products and Strider Knives. Don't claim your product is waterproof, freezeproof, dustproof, and shockproof, unless you can back your product under warranty. I'm going to pass on Fuji's offer to exchange my camera for the $118 fee, which I can use towards an Olympus Tough camera! ;-)As clean and compact as the Fuji XP10 appears, I will suggest to potential buyers of this camera to spend the extra money for the Olympus Tough series, which I am now considering. The Olympus Tough series may not be aesthetically pleasing as the Fuji XP10, but, like the AK-47 and Glock, the Olympus will probably work.Buy the Fuji XP10 at your own risk.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Waterproof:Yes;Good Pics: NO", "Author": "Ed from Las Cruces", "ReviewID": "R2E6YNYHLCVFOW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just took the new camera on a white water rafting trip down the Grand Canyon. Clearly the camera met the specs for water tightness and shock ability as this type of trip had both. Pictures were of low quality, with little ability to handle a mix of shadows and light. Shutter is slow and unresponsive to the moment. In bright sunshine, or very low evening light, the lack of a view finder rendered most pictures a pure guess. Controls at the top of the camera for on/off and snapping the picture were too low a profile to allow for handling in tough situations. Worst of all was dismal battery life--only able to get about 100-125 pictures, while carefully turning the camera off in between, before battery was exhausted. Overall--very disappointing.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly good little camera, with a couple of shortcomings", "Author": "S. Greene", "ReviewID": "R2OTIVVIROHXVI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera to replace my previous underwater / shockproof Canon D10, which died after about 8 months for no apparent reason.  When I got the D10, it was the only low-cost point-and-shoot I could find for light underwater use, which made it good in its own way, but the electronics and sensor and etc. were already a couple of years out of date on the Canon, plus it was really big and bulky.I don't do serious underwater work, but do want a camera I can take out in the rain and occasionally in a swimming pool or to the beach, without worrying about it.  Also with small kids, the likelihood of a camera getting dropped is high, so a sturdy model is key.This little Fujifilm advertises the same kind of water- and shock-proof characteristics as the Canon, but it's a whole lot more modern in its features, and a whole lot smaller, which is great.  I haven't used it underwater yet, but for everyday use it takes good pictures.A few issues I have with it.  One, the cable connector is nonstandard.  It should be mini-USB, like so many other things - I keep a mini USB hanging off my computer anyway, and if I lose a mini USB cable it's easy to find another, vs. the Fuji cable which doesn't match anything else I own.Second, the mechanicals are not quite as polished as I'd like.  The waterproof cover for the cable connector doesn't seat well - it's very hard to get in.  And the battery cover has a strange hinge device that was confusing to figure out and I fear will not last well, since I have to open it frequently to extract the memory card, because the cable connector is nonstandard and hard to reseal.All in all I would still recommend this camera, and I hope these few flaws get corrected in a future model.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stylish

fun outdoors while taking pictures. It:- is waterproof to 10 ft. under water, perfect for swimming pools, beach, snorkeling (note: do not use in hot water!)- is shockproof up to 3 ft., great for jogging, cycling, or even letting your baby learn to take pictures- is freezeproof down to 14 degrees Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius)- is dustproof- is weatherproof except in very hot climates- has 12.2 effective megapixels- has 5x optical zoom and features a Fujinon lens for great clarity; lens focal length is 36-180mm in 35mm film camera terms- takes 720p widescreen, VGA or QVGA video- can zoom optically in video mode (but see note on audio recording below)- is really small and weighs just a little over 5 oz. with battery and SDHC card- uses SDHC memory card, no more xD that was championed by Fuji and OlympusI bought a green XP10 because I love spending time in the water -- and the green body looks really nice (and works whether you are a guy or gal)! I find that, outdoors during the day, the XP10 takes pictures with excellent clarity and excellent color saturation and contrast. Using fill-in flash in daylight truly enhances the picture. Indoors, because the XP10 lacks Fuji's legendary SuperCCD technology, picture quality is average for a compact or super-compact camera. It does have two natural-scene modes where it boosts the ISO (light sensitivity of the image sensor) at the expense of increased noise. I bought my XP10 to be used outdoors, in the pool and at the beach, so I haven't taken many indoor pics.Video shooting at 720p yields smooth, clear HD video clips. BTW, video size is limited only by the 2GB FAT32 file size limit -- this means even if you pop in a 16GB SDHC card, the longest video clip can only go up to 2GB in file size, due to the limit imposed by the FAT32 file system. Video is recorded as motion JPEG in an AVI container, so it can be played on many, many devices, at the expense of slightly larger file sizes than a more compact format like MPEG-2 or MPEG-4.While you can zoom optically -- a feature that every digital camera should have -- audio recording's volume level is lowered during zooming. Instead, the camera picks up some noise from the lens mechanism and that noise overwhelms the ambient sounds you want to record, which can be annoying when played back on a large TV. My advise is to use zooming sparingly during video mode. If you want great video recording on a compact digital camera, you should get a Sony or Canon or Panasonic camera (be prepared to pay a lot more for the waterproof feature, though).Battery life is on the short side, rated at 165 shots per charge with flash on 50% of the time. This is not surprising given the ultra-compact form factor. It's not an issue for me because I only use it at the pool (i.e., I have other cameras for other occasions); but if you plan to take it on a day trip to the beach, a spare battery is a probably a must, especially if you use the flash a lot or take a lot of HD video. BTW, regardless of the digital camera you buy, I think a spare battery is pretty much always a necessity. Fuji deserves kudos for including a very compact 100-240V wall charger.Anyway, my sample video clip shows how the camera works under water. The video resolution was set to QVGA (320x240) for easy upload to Amazon, but you should be able to see the amazing clarity both in and out of water (allowing for artifacts introduced by Amazon's video compression).In summary, the XP10 is a great waterproof, shockproof camera that every water enthusiast should bring along to record fun memories.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "NOT Waterproof", "Author": "T. Ingalls", "ReviewID": "R3D2JLXFCETFDM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for the waterproof feature, for beach and snorkeling photos. I took it to the beach and within 30 minutes it broke. The camera was never more than 2 feet underwater and it never hit anything. Water began leaking in the back display screen and the camera stopped functioning. Water also got in the front lens area and battery. Fortunately I was able to get the photos I had taken off the memory card.Picture quality was really nice and the display screen size is large for easy viewing. But if you plan on taking it in the water I suggest buying a different camera.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "great service on my current vacation", "Author": "hard worker", "ReviewID":

the low light and landscape mode and they work as advertised. i find getting the latest cameras every 2 years makes a huge difference in the image quality and features. this is a vastly better camera to use than my old sony w 170. the waterproof features a working fine so far. took the camera into the carribean sea for the past 4 days and have no problems so far. the various preprogrammed settings are doing their jobs as advertised. i use it primarily for my memories and pix log for my own use. i do not have a \"pro's\" perspective on image quality. for my use it has exceeded my expections. the movie mode a working to my satisfaction. i got some great video of the fort lauderdale-miami beach front from the sky from my airplane seat. the zoom function works with video too.  that will be a great memory. what . took the camera over  feet deep on a sea trek adventure and it did not have any problems. took the camera for a one hour snorkel adventure in my board shorts by mistake and did not have any problems with the camera. hope this is a useful review for the vast majority of the point and shoot crowd, for the rest there is always a slr, will try to post images in different

I was showing my husband the reviews on here and we were really surprised by how many are disappointed with their camera. Maybe I don't expect enough however, I did drop it and it didn't break; it took great pictures in and out of the water and the video works nicely as well.I bought this for $139 at a local warehouse club and I think it's worth every penny for the underwater pictures and video alone. We've had a blast using it!BTW, the video image isn't grainy. Their are water sprinklers that shoot over the pool, so what you are seeing is sprinkles and not a bad video.

This is my first camera actually. I never bought one before bc anytime that I want a camera I am at the beach, river, fishing, pool, drinking, etc (i live in FL). I couldn't bring myself to buy a camera that i know would break with my lifestyle. I liked the D10 but it's so expensive and I'm not gonna carry that egg thing in my pocket. The previous WP Fuji camera got pretty good reviews and I liked the sample pics people uploaded from them the most. Even more than the Olympus or Pentax. The new XP10 was about to come out with better resolution etc so I pre-ordered it.I am very happy with this camera! It looks real nice (silver), fits in my pocket, is super tough (i've thrown it around), the waterproof is great, 5X opt zoom (great for video), HD video, and the pics look real good for my purposes. I wasn't sure about the buttons behind rubber(?) before but they click when you press them so it's nice.I'm not a pro photographer, i'm not making posters of landscapes or anything. These pics are for facebook basically. I wouldn't have any pics at all if it weren't for a tough waterproof camera. My sister's SLR takes much better pictures indoors of my aquarium and food (we like to take pics of food we make).  But this is still an awesome camera.The battery does suck on this camera. It will only last for one day of fun. The next day it will die pretty quick if you try to keep going on it. So i'm gonna have to buy another battery or hope for an extended life one to come out  :/  I've used friends' cameras that last weeks on a charge. But, they're not WP.  I'll deal.The other thing - low light pics.  They don't come out crisp at all. It's not a big deal to me bc it's usually at parties when i'm drunk so it kind of captures the moment being a little warm and blurry looking. People actually seem to kind of like it. But just a warning.Overall this is a great camera for most every situation and is a good deal at $200 (mine came with a 4gb memory card).  I highly recommend  :]I can't wait to try it on my next ski trip!I will upload sample pics.UPDATE: The camera is still awesome. I took it snorkeling off Key Biscyane National Park. The camera held up great and the HD video of the reef is pretty cool. We went down further than 10ft a bunch of times but only briefly. That was a few months ago and the camera is still running great.One problem: the film that gives the rubber over the buttons that matte look is peeling off. I think it's from the chlorine in the pool. I peeled it all off and it's fine now. But just a heads up.I think the price is down to $140 w/memory card at Costco (awesome return policy).

Yes, I might sacrifice some picture quality or credit card slim size for my requirements but what good are those other cameras (like a few of my old ones) if they are \"accidentally\" broken within one month?My other digital camera is an Olympus Stylus Weather/Shock that is a few years old.  I must say that so far after a month's usage I prefer the Fuji XP10 over my other camera.What I like about the Fuji: -Good size and form factor.  Thumbs up to the large display screen. -I like that it takes a standard memory card (which was included).  My Olympus takes strange size memory card (=expensive, hard to find). -Easy to use (point and shoot).  Picture quality seems decent enough though not as good as some of the high end cameras -Did I mention it is weatherproof and shockproof?  Hasn't broken yet.  I do give my other Olympus camera a thumbs up for surviving several years. -Value for the price.What could be better: -Battery life hasn't seemed that great to me as of yet, but does come with a charger.  Battery life still better than my Olympus though. -Battery hatch hard to open.  I consider myself fairly good with gadgets but I actually had to read the instructions to figure out how to open the battery hatch = there will be questions/complaints/nags about this from my wife & kids.In summary, this camera fulfills my mandatory requirement of weatherproof/shockproof.  Second most important to me is size/wearability and this camera is good in that area.  Decent pictures are expected as a given and delivered by this camera.

I took this camera on a trip where my friend was shooting pretty much same scenery with Canon SD800 under the same lighting conditions, yet the difference in quality is striking, almost every photo I took with XP10 went straight to trashcan.  BTW, I am quite experienced with digital photography, over the last 10 years owned 5 P&S; and 3 SLRs - I know how to use cameras and what to expect from them.The picture quality, IMO, is enough to strike this camera off anybody's wishlist, yet this doesn't end the list of problems:1) Camera has exceptionally long shutter lag.  I don't know how to measure it precisely, but it seems like a whole second, maybe more, passes after you press the button and before camera finally snaps a photo.2) LCD monitor is impossible to use on the sunny day - it's a nearly perfect mirror, as you try to compose the photo all you can see is the reflection of your own frustrated face.3) Buttons are poorly placed - as you hold the camera, the palm of your hand is pressing against super-sensitive control buttons and as you press the shutter, it's the other buttons that get inadvertently pressed - instead of taking a photo, camera switches to a different mode.4) waterproof - didn't test it personally, but beware: the manual states that to maintain waterproofness you are supposed to replace rubber parts every year or so.  This sounds like too much hassle and additional expense.  I used to own Pentax waterproof P&S; in the past - it was maintenance-free.5) The lens is uncovered - for a camera that supposedly designed to withstand abuse, this is a risky design decision.  I'd think that uncovered lens would get scratched soon.6) The video quality turned out to be as bad as picture quality if not worse.

I first looked at its predecessor the WP30 several months ago for a trip to Crystal River for snorkeling with the manatees. It is perfect for that as the shallow water does not really require a pro type camera. At that time a friend loaned me his Olympus water resistant camera which worked out great. Except for the fact that I managed to corrupt his XD memory card and had to buy him a new one. All I did was to erase the pictures I took in a card reader rather than the camera. Thankfully everyone is going away from the proprietary memory stick and XD card formats towards SD only cards.Anyway, the Fuji compares very well with the almost twice as expensive Olympus by my own experience. It also competes against a Casio EXG1, Kodak, Pentax, Canon D10, Olympus Tough 3000/8000 and a Panasonic TS1/TS2 12 megapixel class  water resistant type cameras. Water resistant/proof here refers to cameras that can be submerged at a depth of 10-33ft for extended (but not indefinite, typically one hour in the specs) periods of time.I never intended it to be my primary camera, but decided to compare it to my past ones anyway. These were a 4mp 4x Canon A520, and a 5mp 12x Panasonic FZ20. My initial guess was that the 5x 12mp Fuji and the 12x 5mp Panasonic would give exactly the same amount of detail (5*12=60) when zoomed in far away and cropped to the same size. Nope, not even close. The Panasonic with a superb Leica lens was much much much better. As a matter of fact the Fuji was barely better in the amount of detail and PQ (picture quality) it provided than the older Canon. It really seems that when the pictures are examined up close (pixel peeping), the Fuji tends to smear fine details like blades of grass. This is not objectionable at normal viewing. Focusing is accurate and average in speed. Shot to shot times are about 2-3 sec, faster than the Canon, slower than the Panasonic.Some other brief observations: Any ISO above 200 is extremely noisy, when I thought the auto ISO function would take it above 200, I manually fixed the ISO at 200. There is image stabilization, digital, but I for the world could not see any effect, and you have to turn it ON as it is OFF by default. For me the face recognition only worked about 20% of the time when there were faces in the picture. The build quality of the camera is excellent, the metal body feels rock solid, and like many Apple products, it just feels good in your hand. The rounded corners allow it to slip very easily into a pocket. The control pad is too small for fingers and you have to use your fingernails. The data connector is yet another proprietary style plug. Ditch it and get a card reader instead, the software it comes with is not worth bothering with, if you do not have anything else, use Picassa (free). The HD movie quality is very good when you have ample light, indoors it is too grainy. Although zoom is available when filming, don't use it, the noise it makes on the file is overwhelming. Camera is NOT compatible with the EyeFi Pro X2 wireless SD cards (pictures store just fine, but any camera  playback read operation will corrupt the data). Battery life was reported as below average (<200 shots), which has not been my observation, but I picked up several spare widely available discount non OEM batteries here on Amazon.Overall I had very mixed feelings, as I expected more in terms of a 12mp picture quality and would have given the camera only 2 stars. Then I had to remember why I got it in the first place. It was for the weatherproof capabilities. Any picture that you can actually take is much better than the one you wished for but could not take for lack of equipment. So for the price, build quality, and convenience factor it gets 3 stars overall. It will probably be coming with me more often than not as a backup. You can spend twice as much and still not get a camera that will be good at all the things that I had issues with.

The Canon would capture digital video, but not without my having to find and dig through the manual before trying.  This Fuji is as easy to use for video as it is for stills.  More on that later.I was a little disconcerted that there was no automatic lens cap, but what appears to be the lens is a thick glass (maybe acrylic?) cover that you can smudge to your heart's content, then grab your t-shirt and clean it as you would your spectacles.  Lens movement (zooming) happens inside the protective glass cocoon.  The large and bright display on the back has a durable, sturdy feel like the lens cover.  You get the feeling you would have to really try to scratch or damage them.Shooting still photos:  the camera starts up in \"Scene Recognition\" mode which works amazingly well at figuring out what you're shooting and setting the camera accordingly.  There are lots of other modes (presets, really) that are easy to select, like Beach, Snow, Landscapes, Night, Sport, Underwater and others that you see on a lot of cameras.  There are also some interesting oddballs like the setting that takes two pictures back to back, one with flash and one without, so you can choose the one you like best.  A terrific feature for me is Image Stabilization, which reduces the effect of shaky hands on photo quality.  I inherited something called \"essential tremor\" from my Mom's side of the family and my hands shake - sometimes not at all, sometimes a little, sometimes a little more.  The last set of photos I took with my old Canon was at a classic car auction and I had to discard more than half of them because of this.  In my experimenting with the Fuji (even at much higher resolution), photos are very, very sharp.Shooting video: I think I mentioned it's very easy compared to a still camera where video seems to be implemented as an add-on, not a primary feature.  You can choose from three quality levels, the higher quality consuming more SD card space than lower quality as you'd imagine.  Videos are saved as .AVI files.  One of the problems I discovered a while back was that videos easily become huge and may be difficult to upload to a website like YouTube, which has both size and duration (play length) limits.  The Flip video camera excels at making small, ready-to-upload videos and the Fuji doesn't do that (I don't think any still camera does that).  However, Google around for \"HandBrake\" for an open-source converter that will convert videos from one format to another and even allow you to specify how big the resulting video file will be.  Finally, I'm not sure, but it looks to me like the Image Stablization feature also works in video mode.  I just shot a \"before\" video of my kitchen prior to a major remodel, and what I saw in the camera display was shaky.  What I saw in the finished video file looked just fine.Cons that I probably wouldn't have noticed except for reviews on other sites:- no viewfinder.  Some like to hold the camera to their eyes to stabilize it.  The digital image stabilization features keeps this from being a problem for me.- can't zoom in/out while making a video.  You have to adjust the zoom where you want it before you start shooting.- took me a while to figure out how to open the battery + SD card cover.  You have to move the latch and slide the cover away from the camera body in one motion.Pros:- very easy to use for stills AND video.  This is a camera you can give Mom or Dad and they'll have success with it just using the defaults.- image stabilization.  This is my first camera with this capability and it is awesome.- lots of options for camera buffs who like to tweak settings; for those of us who don't care they are not in the way- 4GB SD card included (a surprise)- smaller than I expectedI'm looking forward to a long relationship with this thing.  Very nice piece of work!Update 6/11/2010: watch your battery level (I'm not sure exactly how to do that; it's on my list to find out) before downloading to the included desktop software (MyFinePix Studio).  I was copying a video from the camera to MyFinePix Studio and I'm thinking the battery reached critical level, and MyFinePixStudio stopped responding.  I thought I had lost the video (it had disappeared from the camera) but after recharging the battery and doing another sync, there it was.When the battery went, it went immediately.  An amber light had been blinking on the front of the camera just beforehand, which I thought just meant \"busy,\" but now I'm thinking I was wrong.  Another reviewer criticized the battery life and I've had no problem with it lasting for a typical day, but now I think you do need to get a spare if you plan to be away from the charger for a few days.Still liking this camera and wouldn't change the 5-star opinion.

This was a \"bad\" pixel. I tested it several times after that and still noticed that white pixel was still on the pictures, so I then took it back and exchanged it for another one (a Black one) because these things happen sometimes, not really a big deal.So I tested the second camera before going to the Virgin Islands, and it worked great, so off I went. -- Used the camera under water and took some awesome pictures.

We specifically purchased this camera because of an impending trip to the beach with our twins (their first experience of the ocean).  We also knew that we wanted something between our DROID phone cameras and our higher end DLR camera that was portable, small, took decent pictures (without the lag of the DROID camera) and even some short video while being difficult to damage.We put the camera through its paces at the beach and were very pleased with the results.  The picture quality and options for different camera modes are great.  I was especially pleased to find that it could take sequential shots. I have big hands so I'm sometimes leary of smaller cameras, but this fit well and I was able to take pictures and video while holding the camera in many different ways.  The camera was exposed to sun, sand, salt water and pool water at depths of up to five feet multiple times and continued to perform as expected.  Overall, the video quality was actually a bit better than I expected (I had very low expectations for video quality from such a device).  The following issues/items are what contributed to me giving this 4 stars instead of five:- As others have indicated, the camera has a short battery life.- Getting pictures to the computer was easier to do by ejecting the SD card and inserting it into the computer rather than carting around the specialty cable the camera requires.  As others have mentioned, a standard cable would be preferred.- You have to be very diligent about paying attention to the focus, especially when taking video.  Once you start shooting video, you can no longer adjust the focus and it can be very finicky about getting the focus correct.- The focus is sometimes finicky with photos as well, especially indoors in less than bright light- The LCD screen was scratched the first day.  I was as careful as I could to keep sand off of it and to rinse it when it did get sand on it.  I suppose it may be impossible to have an LCD screen intended for this kind of use that will not get scratched.- This isn't so much a flaw with the camera as a caveat to any who may be newer to waterproof cameras like we are.  It's important to be sure the lens is free of water when shooting.  Several of our shots have large obvious water droplets ruining the shot while there was no indication of this while shooting.  This is noted in the users manual.All in all, we are very pleased with the camera and hope to get lengthy use from it.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great in the right situation", "Author": "C.

King", "ReviewID": "R19V4SH4GZ3JRA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little camera is geared to active, fast moving folks who want to preserve and share their fun, but who might be too rough on the standard camera.  This camera won't complain if dropped in the snow or splashed at the beach (I actually poured water over it as a test).  It's perfect for your budding photographer's school project as it can survive bumpy rides in backpacks and the occasional `Woops!'It's not the perfect camera for everyone, but it's pretty good.  You have to weigh your needs against its features.On the good side:  It's small and easily transportable.  The viewing window is really big and easy to see. It doesn't need a case and has a convenient wrist strap.  It's very automatic and readjusts itself fast and effectively to the situation at hand.  You can get really close to a subject and still get a clear picture and it does a great job with videos.  In fact, that's my favorite feature.  This little camera does an excellent job of keeping the focus good during videos so you can extract single frames as still photos with the proper software.  There is a separate video button to start and stop the recording so you don't end up framing the perfect still only to realize too late you forgot to reset some dial back to still after taking a video.  It doesn't seem to pick up sound as well as my other camera, however. You can zoom in before starting a video to get closer to the action, but you can't change the zoom during the video.The on/off button is illuminated so there's no question of the camera being on and there is almost no delay when taking a picture in bright light.  The zoom is pretty decent, going up to 5x and still taking a good picture in bright light.On the down side, there are some things I wasn't as happy with.  I had more trouble with the original setup than I expected.  It took me a while to get the hang of how things worked (the instructions aren't that great).  Once I did though, I was satisfied with the various menu options and editing ability.The battery, the card (they include a 4GB one) and the cable attachment spot are all in the same compartment and I still have trouble getting it open.  I need both hands and find the required combination of movements awkward. While the menu button and wheel on the back are fine, I don't always get prompt action from the other buttons.  It could be partly because I'm left-handed and am pushing them at a slightly different angle but I often have to retry several times before they respond.  The on/off button and shutter button are a little quirky for me too.  The W and T labels regarding zoom didn't mean anything to me so I looked them up on the internet and now know they stand for Wide Angle and Telephoto, but I'd have been a lot happier with Zoom In and Out.In a shady or flash situation there is a noticeable delay before the shutter snaps, which can lead to missing your shot, plus the quality of the picture isn't nearly as good as in bright light.  I've fiddled a little with settings but haven't gotten that to improve.  That, of course, isn't a problem if most of your use will be on the slopes or the beach.Today I took almost 100 stills and videos and reviewed them several times, and worked with the menu options and choices much more than you usually would, but in the course of all that I managed to use up the entire battery life and had to recharge it again.  The recharge took about an hour.  I will grant you my use was excessive, but still I was surprised that I could run the battery out in one day since my other camera batteries seem to last forever.  Clearly all the automatic refocusing and switching options are resource heavy activities.  You can even hear the gears working in there.  If you want the automation (which is very useful) working for you all the time and expect to be taking lots of pictures, it would probably be wise to have an extra battery on hand.I only use the software to extract the pictures from the camera and at first was stymied about starting that operation, but found in the instruction book that I had to turn the camera on via the review button rather than the on button.  Then the software starts automatically and is effective for picture extraction.  The included USB cable is not very long, which is good for a laptop or front USB port, but not so good if you want to hook it up in the back of a desktop computer.  The separate battery recharging unit which plugs into the wall has folding prongs which make it somewhat easier to carry with you on trips. It's lightweight, but a bit bulkier than it needs to be.Bottom line: this seems like a good rugged little camera that will please lots of people who want to use it while vacationing and doing active things, but because of the low light issues, this may not be right as an `only' camera.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive; too bad it didn't last long", "Author": "dappy15", "ReviewID": "R2QW3A511G3P8W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was a cheap alternative to the higher priced cameras of its class.

I consider it more of a \"fun\" camera. If your expectations for it is not sky high, you won't set yourself up for an easy disspointment. The picture quality on this camera can't compare to my old Canon point and shoot. Since I bought the camera mainly for water activities, I'll focus more on this.Water video was interesting but not really good. It doesn't have image stabilization and if you're like most people, you're probably trying to have fun and video above the water or while snorkeling than to try to keep your hands as steady as possible. The 720p resolution on it is nice to have. I'm sure it would take nice videos if you're using a tripod. I found that most of my videos were annoying to watch because it looked like I was filming when an earthquake is happening. The sound when taken on land was sometimes muffled and I can't understand anything. Maybe defective for this camera? I don't know.The underwater picture quality was not too bad. It was much better than those disposable underwater cameras. I don't really have any comparison for quality besides that. If it worked, it's cool enough for me. When the camera was out of the water and wet, you can see the water spots on the lense when viewing your pictures later. One drop of water may be small but when enlarged to a computer screen, it's a good portion of your picture. Maybe I needed to wipe rain-x on it so the water dropplets won't stick on the lense. =)The problem comes when it only lasted a short while. On my 2nd outing using the camera at the beach in the water, it started acting funny and stopped working. I dried it off and was hoping what I read from other reviewers did not just happen to me. I opened the battery compartment and found that sand and water managed to get in. How much, I don't know but enough for it to stop functioning. The memory stick wasn't demaged when I dried it off and put it in the pc, so there's a plus there. Probably just enough water to shock it.

The underwater photos are great, but the waterproofing seems to be more of a temporary feature and after minimal use you can expect it to deteriorate.Looks like I'll be in the market for a new camera soon and next time I won't be woo-ed by the \"underwater\" and \"rugged\" marketing claims.

I own an SLR, so as far as quality goes, there is obviously NO comparison.  However, and even expecting a so-so job, I am pretty disappointed with the quality of the images at 12MP, 1600ISO.  Tough to focus on small objects at a 3in. distance, you can hear the zoom rattle in there, trying to make sense of the image (tried it on Manual, Portrait, and a couple of other settings).

To help other folks decide I am writing this review based on heavy usage in this camera.First of all I picked the Green color in case I lose the camera in the water it is easier to see than the black or gray. I bought this camera to use it at the waterparks and the lakes we visit during the summer. This camera went with us to 3 different waterparks and 2 different lakes. I always had it in my swim trunks pocket regardless of what I was doing: swimming, building sand castle with the kids, playing in the water etc.Verdict: this camera performed exactly the way it is supposed to work, it was tight enough to disallow water or sand to go into the battery compartment. Picture quality was not the best however I did not expect a superb quality. But I was able to take pictures that I would not have able to take without it. sometimes you have to wipe the glass in front of the lens because a drop of water can ruin a picture. The camera was slow to focus (I played with all modes) but again waterparks I went to were mostly indoors (light conditions). Under water both the video and still were awesome, I took very nice shots of my kids going under water. Depending on shooting conditions, the pictures sometimes turn out to be grainy, but again this is a function of the ISO and the shutter speed to get the picture.Beware of the battery, the battery life is really short, I recommend you purchase a spare battery and have it on hand during the day because you will run out of batteries. Per trip I average about 200 pictures and videos, and I usually get about 80 pictures to print or keep. Keep in mind that a lot of shots are thrown out due to composition (which is a user error and not a camera error).Summary: If you are purchasing this camera to use it only at the beach/water you will be happy, but if you are planning to use it as a walk around camera you will be disappointed.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great features, disappointing performance", "Author": "Joshua V. Schneider", "ReviewID": "R2WK3KJK8TZ6DZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Starting with some basics about the use of the camera, I would say that the battery life was very good, and was a noticeable improvement over my previous digital camera which used AA's. There is no viewfinder, so you must use the LCD screen, but it doesn't drain the battery very quickly. The battery charger gave a full charge in about 1 hour.The LCD screen is large and easy to read. Underwater it was obviously more difficult to see, with glare and sunlight, but when there were objects in focus, such as fish or corals, it was very usable and showed good color. The challenge is that underwater photography is not as simple as one might first guess, because when you are trying to take pictures of fish, for example--you are moving, the water (including any suspended sand or sediment) is moving, and the fish is moving. So you expend lots of tries to get a few really good pictures. This was the camera's most interesting feature. Fortunately the Finepix XP10 really did perform, and we were able to get plenty of good pictures underwater, even under less than ideal conditions. Due to the visibility, we found that the zoom feature didn't work very well under water. Holding the camera with both hands at arm's length to get as close as possible to the object gave the best photo. One of the things that I didn't like was that it was very awkward to hold the camera with one hand and take pictures, especially underwater. The not-quite-rectangular shape of the camera made it slippery to hold with one hand. It's limited by a 10 ft. depth, so this camera is ideal for pictures while snorkeling, but not for deeper diving.The most disappointing thing about the Finepix camera was the use in typical, average lighting conditions. Inside with natural light coming in through windows, outdoors with a mix of sunny and shady lighting, and a variety of other normal, mixed lighting conditions, the pictures frequently came out overexposed in one region, and too dark in others. I experimented in many different situations, always trying the auto, Scene recognition auto, natural light, landscape, party, etc settings. Sometimes I could get a little improvement by changing the settings, but who wants to have to take six pictures on different settings before you get one that comes out decently? Natural light seemed to work the best in most situations, but I found that the Scene Recognition and Auto settings tended to perform poorly. They weren't able to adjust well to produce natural color and lighting balance. Sometimes it would appear on the LCD that the image was caught well, but when you snapped a photo the colors were distorted, something was overexposed, or it was blurry. I also occasionally had some improvement by using program mode and lowering the ISO to 100 or 200, but sometimes these pictures came out a little blurry as well. One trick that sometimes helped in mixed lighting conditions was to aim the camera at a brighter region of the intended picture and half-click to focus, then move to the person or object that you wanted in center frame. This sometimes compensated for overexposure.The camera performed better in certain lighting situations, however. The nighttime setting captured shots that most digital cameras couldn't. Any moving objects were blurry, but a moonlit bay or the lights from a skyline came out better than I expected. In dusky conditions it was still difficult to get a good, balanced shot. Sunset photos probably performed the best for the camera, and both in landscape and sunset mode it was able to compensate well for having very bright and direct sunlight coming in, without overexposing the picture, strangely enough. Also, landscape mode worked well in bright, sunny conditions. I thought the video mode worked well, and adjusted well to different lighting, and could zoom in and out while filming, though this created a loud sound in the finished video.If you are mainly buying this for underwater use, it's a good buy. But overall I would say that the camera is good for certain special uses, but for a general purpose camera, I was disappointed.  You typically want a point-and-shoot camera that can automatically adjust to situations and capture the lighting and color accurately, but this camera did not perform well at that task. The underwater feature and the variety of modes were very useful and interesting. I didn't find the face detection mode to work very easily and usually turned that off. The feature for adjusting to camera shake didn't seem to work very well either. It seemed excessively sensitive. The camera has an impressive array of features, and is user-friendly, but I had difficulty getting many high-quality, crisp, well-colored shots.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Rugged, Small, Convient, great for the on the go family..no problems with battery life", "Author": "JRay", "ReviewID": "R2CU984MGN5QGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Edited Update:  I just had to update the below review.  This is the best camera I have ever had in terms of getting water pictures.  I have had to much fun this summer with this camera.  How awesome to go to the waterpark and wade through the whole waterpark (especially the wave pool) with the camera available to take great action water soaked pictures.  I had this camera on my wrist and in the water for hours.  The battery did well and the camera was untouched by the water.  This won't be the last Fuji product I buy.  I would have never thought to get a waterproof camera, but I am SO glad to have this.  I have had so much fun reviewing this product, and using it!!! GET IT if you want to have fun!!I really love this camera.  It is small and very easy to take anywhere. It fits in any pocket or compartment that I have no matter how small.  I seem to be on the move constantly with my two boys 4 and 8, one minute we are headed to a  ball game or the city pool, or maybe waterpark.  So I am constantly changing bags and thowing contents here and there.  This camera doesn't have to worry about surviving my kids, but me and so far so good.  I have tossed it and dropped it.  So it has thus far proven to me its shock value.I really like the Zoom.  Last year my three year old was playing with my camera and wrecked my Zoom.  It was one of those that came out of the camera.  This zoom doesn't so I don't have to worry about that again, in case he gets his hands on it.  I also found the Zoom to be very adequate, and for the money it gives you more zoom that alot of cameras in this price range.The picture quality is wonderful.  I have though found that if your light quality is not that bright or great you may not get the pictures you want.  We went to the museum and the pictures didn't turn out that great, but the lighting there was horrible.  You can upload your pictures right to facebook which can be very convient.I found the controls to be easy to control.  You do have to press right on the W and T to get the Zoom to work, but I haven't had any problems doing that.  I have not had any problems getting used to opening the battery compartment like some other reviewers had.THe battery life for me has been just as good as my other cameras.  It seems to charge up fast, and the battery lasts all week for me while I am taking pictures everyday with it.  I have been pleased with it.Overall the camera is great for me.

Yes, it is very nice to have that waterproofing on your camera!I would highly recommend this camera.  The last thing  I really liked on ths camera that  I have not seen as an option on any other camera, is how it will take two pictures of the same scene for you.  It will do it once with the flash and one without the flash.  You just have to make sure your subject stands still enough for the camera to get both pictures.  But I have really liked that setting.

There is no indicator to show if the camera is in stand-by mode or off, so you have to either guess or press the power button and risk turning the camera off when it was actually only in stand-by, then wait for it to turn on again. The automatic scene settings are unreliable; once it is in macro, it tends to stay there even when pointed at a landscape. As far as I an tell there is no way to turn off the red-eye reduction. Underwater photos are hit-and-miss. Sometimes the photo will come out beautifully and sometimes it will just be grey, even with \"underwater\" mode manually selected.

It takes nice underwater pictures and pretty good above water pictures when you are in the water.  That's about it though, normal pictures often come out faded or hazy looking.  This is especially true in certain lighting conditions such as indoor pictures with light coming through a window, for example.  I compared pictures of the same landscape that this Fuji camera took with ones from a 10 year old 4MP Canon and the Canon's pictures blew it away.  The clarity was night and day.  Last week during my trip to the Dominican Republic I jumped in the water for my snorkeling trip and tried to turn the camera on only to realize that the camera had died.  Water leaked into this \"waterproof\" camera somehow!  You can see water under the view finder and the camera is officially dead now.  Luckily after letting my memory card sit out for a few hours to dry I was able to restore the pictures but the camera is dead.  It's too bad it died right before my swim with sharks as this was one of the reasons I bought it.Looking back at it, maybe one of the compartments on the camera was not fully closed when I brought it into the water.  Before I threw the camera into the garbage recently I noticed that the piece of rubber on the side was not fully closed.  Maybe it was like that when I jumped in and that's why it leaked.  Who knows, but I'm about to buy a new waterproof camera and I'm staying away from Fuji. I gave the camera 3 stars because it takes good underwater pictures and it's cheap.

I gave it a good workout, taking it white water rafting on the Zambezi river (the toughest rapids in the world), as well as tubing, kayaking, and just plain old rain.  I dented the camera on the Zambezi, but it still works like new, and never took in any water.That's where the positives end though.  This camera has software bugs, and they're nasty.  In the automatic modes, the camera sometimes gets exposure and/or focus wrong.  I'm not talking about a picture that is a little dark or light or a slightly soft focus, this camera will randomly decide to turn the exposure all the way up or down and you end up with a framed blob of bright white or inky black.  Likewise with focus, I now have some very artsy abstracts in beiges and browns, that with any focus at all would have been beautiful snapshots of lions playing.Fortunately I found a solution -- exposure and focus seem to work fine in the landscape preset mode, and the portrait preset mode.  So it all worked fine as long as I had face recognition off and didn't use any of the fancy automatic preset modes.Other nits -- like many point and shoots today this camera has no viewfinder, bad news in sunlight.  To make it worse, the LCD dims after just a few seconds, making it even harder to see in sunlight, to get full brightness on the LCD you have to remember to press the shutter button halfway.  Also, there's a delay of about a half second from pressing the shutter button to when the picture is taken, making it hard to get the exact shot you want.  I also hate it's indoor white balance, much much too red, maybe it's another bug that I haven't found the solution to yet.So my overall rating is 4 stars -- mostly because it's a waterproof camera that really is waterproof, and as long as you know how to work around the bugs it works fine.PROS -- Really is waterproof.

My 4 year old Canon Powershot takes far better still photos, of course it's not waterproof and that is really the point of this review. The features are mostly the same as any other camera. There is a fully automatic mode that works fairly well, as well as a face detection mode; in case you forget what a human face looks like.The video quality is fine for the price range, not stellar, but not terrible. It's not intended as a camcorder but works fine as one, the vids just have to be short. The microphone works fine when emerging out of the water and clears up quickly. The lens works great, water drops roll off most of the time.The battery/SD card compartment is sealed with a rubber gasket on the plastic door, not much to say just worth mentioning.Con: don't use the flash, it is worthless. You'll be able to take about 10 pictures before the battery dies, no that is not a joke. It was added as a courtesy, I assume. Depth is only 10ft anyway, should not be an issue.I will continue to beat up the camera, both above and underwater, and will definitely write if it ends up leaking.To sum it up, this so far makes a fine underwater video camera, above water still shots?

We got ours about 6 weeks ago, but have used it almost daily so far this summer, in pools, waterparks, canoeing, at the stable where we ride horses, at the park....pretty much everywhere!! Our take on some of the features:waterproof - 100% yes, and amazing shots in/under the water.  No problems in the pool or at the waterpark, although I did notice this morning that some of the plastic coating around the keys seems to be peeling up this morning - not sure what is up with that but I'm not very happy about it...12MP pictures - for a point & shoot, takes excellent pictures.  Has underwater setting, sport setting, night setting etc, for even better pictures. Have not used video funtion to say how it works.Battery life - sucks, to be blunt.  We rarely get a full day out of the battery, a day and a half tops.  Although I do take a LOT of pictures.  Extra battery and/or car charger are an absolute necessity and need to be factored into overall cost.  One note - for some reason the camera WILL let you put the battery in UPSIDE DOWN!!!  Locks right into place too!  So if you replace the battery and it doesn't power on, try switching out the battery position.Physical attributes - small/compact, lightweight, huge display screen.  Battery/memory card door slot IS very hard to open, but once you figure it out it's not bad.  There is no viewfinder on the camera, if this bugs you (it does my husband) which is really only bad in situations like very bright light where you can't see the LCD very well.  Tons of settings, and very similar to other fuji cameras as well ( I have a fuji SLR with similar functions so I LOVED not having to re-learn all the settings)Overall, a great camera and we've really had fun using it.  For $150 an excellent buy, as long as it continues to hold up - only time will tell on that one...but plan to spend another $20 for extra battery/car charger.  We get stopped by people all the time asking about it at the waterpark & pool, and so far I have highly recommended it.

The only nice thing about it is its size, and that the battery from my Olympus Stylus fit this camera so I could use the second battery when the Fuji battery died (which was regularly.) But its response time is extremely slow: turning on, focusing and processing. There is no indicator to show if the camera is in stand-by mode or off, so you have to either guess or press the power button and risk turning the camera off when it was actually only in stand-by, then wait for it to turn on again. The automatic scene settings are unreliable; once it is in macro, it tends to stay there even when pointed at a landscape. As far as I can tell there is no way to turn off the red-eye reduction. Underwater photos are hit-and-miss. Sometimes the photo will come out beautifully and sometimes it will just be grey, even with \"underwater\" mode manually selected. Water beads up on the lens, causing blurs in the photos. This never happened with my other underwater cameras. I even tried Rain-x on the lens covering as a last resort and it didn't help.

I've taken it all the way to its ten foot depth limit, banged it around a canoe, dropped it in the dirt, and it functions perfectly. Unfortunately, perfectly in the case of this camera means washed out photos, lots of noise in anything but bright light, and often poor auto-focusing. However, the utility of the camera is such that I still find it a nice addition to the gadget drawer.I understand that a small camera has inherent limitations in image quality to the size of the lens and sensor, but compared to our Canon of similar size, the Fuji takes pictures of noticeably lesser quality. On the other hand, our Canon will be very unhappy in a little bit of rain, let alone underwater. Perhaps the need to harden this camera forced them to compromise on image quality. So, I can't be terribly critical of the FinePix XP10. I just want people to know that you're giving up a certain amount of image quality going with this camera, so make sure that you really need the waterproofing if you're going to buy this. If you just get this as your main digital camera, thinking the durability and weather-proofing will be nice, you will probably be disappointed and wish you'd gotten a camera with better image quality.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "OK for messing around, but not good enough for anything serious", "Author": "Aaron Silverman \"DJ Kuul A\"", "ReviewID": "R11ANW6ZD89NQI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "EDIT: Took this on vacation and when we got there, it wouldn't turn on.  Hm, I could've sworn I charged the battery.  So I charged it again.  When the charger said it was finished, I put it back in the camera.  Still nothing.  (Thank god I had my Lumix with me too.) So until I contact Fuji and find out about getting it fixed or replaced, I do NOT recommend this product.*****So the very first thing I did with this camera was drop it the recommended maximum 1 meter onto the concrete surrounding the swimming pool -- not on purpose!  It made a little nick by the tripod hole but otherwise the camera seemed none the worse for wear.  That said, the 1-meter shockproof limit isn't really that impressive.  That's around waist-height for a normal adult.  Better than nothing, though.Next up, in the pool, snapping shots and taking video.  Performance was fine both in and out of the water, although when shooting underwater videos, the sound was a bit noisy and distorted.The camera is small and light, but not too light.  It has enough substance to hold steady nicely.  However, while it is comfortable to hold, some of the buttons are too small and close together.  Hitting the right button (especially the navigation buttons surrounding the Menu/ OK button) is a challenge (I have normal adult-sized fingers).  The menus are clearly laid out and would be easy to use if I didn't keep having to press the Back button after accidentally hitting the wrong button.  Another button issue comes up when shooting videos.  When the camera is in video mode, hitting the shutter button puts it back in photo mode!  To actually start or stop shooting video, you have to press the video button, which is in a very awkward spot on the lower right back of the camera.  It's nearly impossible to press while holding the camera in a normal way -- you have to use both hands.  Setting it up this way was, to be blunt, a moronic decision.So how are the results?  In a word, inconsistent.  Some shots look very nice, while others don't.  (It doesn't hold a candle to my 5MP Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20K 5MP Digital Camera with 12x Image Stabilized Optical Zoom (Black), but that's a pricier camera with a far better lens. Of course, I wouldn't want to drop the Lumix on the concrete!)  The good ones print well at 4x6 or 5x7, but 8x10 might be pushing things.  The focus sensor worked pretty well for the most part.  I'd call it \"acceptable\" for a camera in this price range.One unacceptable attribute was the audio-video synchronization in underwater shooting mode (when shooting in or out of the water).  The audio recording is consistently several seconds ahead of the video, which is especially annoying due to the nice video quality in the bright sunlight at the pool -- and under the water.The included software is easy to install, aside from downloading a very large update.  It's also easy to use.  The only issues with it are that the cable for connecting the camera to the PC is extremely short (less than 2 feet!) and that when it copies the data to the computer, it resets the file creation timestamp to the current date/ time. The \"Date Picture Taken\" remains accurate, but there's no need to require that extra column.  Simply putting the memory card in a reader and copying the data manually is probably the best bet.  However, you'll need to keep the CD for the manual file.  A printed booklet is included in the package, but it's very slim and doesn't cover most of the camera's features.All told, this is an OK product.  Bearing in mind that it's not terribly expensive, and has some nice features, I wouldn't dismiss it out of hand.  You'll have to consider your specific needs -- if you want to take great pictures, look elsewhere.  If you just want something that will fit in your pocket and isn't likely to break via minor abuse, this might work for you.  As for me, I won't be using this for any sports photography or potential family vacation treasures, but I'll probably carry it around for minor events and activities, just in case.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "4.5 stars", "Author": "Deborah Wiley", "ReviewID": "R14LS0TNSIK20Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a small, point and shoot digital camera for taking quality pictures when I'm on the go.

The large display makes it easy to see when the image is in focus although some may miss the traditional viewfinder, particularly in the bright Florida sunlight.The images are sharper than I expected from a point and shoot as the quality certainly shows in the 12 megapixels. However, in lower lit settings it's definitely better to use the automatic settings or otherwise stabilize the camera as the pictures are likely to blur. I had several blur during a daytime thunderstorm, which surprised me a bit.

I chose the XP10 because I got a good price on it at a well-known members-only discount warehouse. The seals are lightweight and the latches do not secure reliably. You MUST be very careful about keeping the seal clean and double-checking that the latch clicks and catches properly. Fujifilm's design with the lens at the left corner instead of the middle is a poor choice. If you hold the camera with both hands to get a steady shot, your left fingers end up on the lens. Picture quality was mediocre. Contrast and color needed Photoshop correction on most shots regardless of environment. I also had a lot of ruined shots because the focus was blurry. I expect some autofocus trouble with \"action\" shots at the pool, but not a posed picture on dry land with a steady camera and a clean lens. Overall the XP10 was disappointing, but as a cheap, light-duty waterproof alternative to my Canon I was willing to live with its flaws. I did enjoy taking underwater shots of my daughter with it in a swimming pool, which came out decent after Photoshop. What lead to my 1-star rating was using the XP10 at the beach. I was in waist-high water I got hit from behind by a wave. The flimsy wrist strap didn't hold and the camera was lost.

Next, I decided to take a video and use the controls on the back of the camera. Guess what, sand got under the rubber backing and prevented me from pushing those buttons. I tore off the rubber backing to get all the sand out and cleaned some of it up.Day 2 we went to another port and I had the camera in my pocket. I took it out to take a picture and found that there was more sand underneath the buttons. Couldn't take a picture at all. Had to wait until I got back on the boat and used toothpicks to clean it out.Day 3 we went snorkeling. I had the camera cleaned up and was sure there was no sand in my pocket.

Good thing! On the second day of snorkeling the camera stopped working (of course just as we were taking pictures of a friendly sea turtle). I took the camera back to the hotel room and removed it from the silicone case. It was still not responsive, and the blue power light was stuck in the the lighted mode.

While this camera was great, the Canon camera is waterproof further - 33 feet underwater, as opposed to 10 feet with this fuji; and, I am just a big fan of canon and used to their software and features.  I will say this though: The finepix camera is more aesthetically pleasing than the Canon D10 and less bulky, making it more versatile than the D10.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "fujifilm finepix XP10", "Author": "Ali from CT", "ReviewID": "RS5J82JPD5VD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera.

I got it in blue for my 22 birthday last month. The small camera is perfect for my college lifestyle. I don't have to worry about dropping it in some beer, or if I take it to a party, I don't have to worry about people getting it wet. The solid construction of the XP10 is ridiculous. I would recommend it to anyone that wants an affordable, sturdy and handy digital camera.This was the only thing I got for my birthday this year along with an SD card (which you will need), and I don't regret it at all. I got an 8 gig card and with it I can shoot up to about 4500 pictures in one of the lowest pixel counts, which is 3 megapixels. That pixel count looks great. Mind you, the quality is not the best of the best but it is very good. The price CANNOT be beaten for such a cool little camera.The features are great too. you can shoot in black and white, sepia and traditional. All look great, I have been taking a lot in black and white and they look fantastic. The video isn't bad, but the noise from the zooming gets kind of irritating. You can hear the zoom when you watch the playback. I suppose this is due to the fact that it is waterproof and the camera is all sealed up. Annoying, but still, I cannt wait to take this down the river with me and get some cool videos of the water. Can your camera do that? Trust me, this is worth it. After all, they say the best camera is camera you have on you. And if this is true, this bad boy can go ANYWHERE with you.The last thing I want to mention is the autofocus. There is no manual focus on the camera. This is defiantly a point and shoot. Now, I have taken about 100 pictures so far and about 30 of them have come out fuzzy due to the autofocus not doing it's job. This camera is defiantly not for people that want something to do some artist shots with. Although, you could actually get pretty creative. I was able to take some really interesting shots in the shower. The camera can actually pick up water drops in mid air! very cool.Overall, nice camera for the price! Such a strong little guy.

Given that I use it when I am not bothering with a higher end camera (I have some Nikons and Leicas for when I feel serious and have the stamina to carry them) I have been pleased with the Finepix line.The older one had what I would call a good interface and decent response time for a point and shoot. This XP10 is a definite improvement. It triggers faster. It's rugged. And the interface allows more custom shooting options. I have to say I have not and probably will not try the waterproof feature. I call it rugged or weatherproof, but don't expect those gasket seals can reliably take a full ten feet of water pressure. If I want to photograph underwater I'll get a proper underwater camera. Anyway this is a nice camera to throw in a bag and take anywhere. And with a moderately large card such as 4 or 8 GB you can hold hundreds of high-res shots or hours of movie. So I'm quite pleased with it and would recommend it as one of the better point and shoots out there.Moreover I'd add that it performs surprisingly well in two types of photography I enjoy particularly, low light and macro. Low light is a bit of a stretch because this little thing is at f/4.5 and you can only do so much. But with ISO 1600 available you can put it on a support and take a long exposure. Again it's nothing like an f/2 or 1.4 on my SLR but fun in itself.For macro I would say it's particularly impressive. It has a \"flower\" or plain macro mode and a text mode. Both give a very flat field shot at close range. I even have to say for some close-ups I prefer this FinePix to my D300 with my 60mm macro lens because of the focusing mechanism. I have an older macro lens with a slow motor so focusing very close is best done by fixing the focus manually and moving the camera body back and forth. Add to that it's almost three pounds of camera and lens. The FinePix, on the other hand, has a very fast continuous focus and can take a macro shot on the fly pretty well. I know a newer macro lens, with a better motor, would give far better images on my D300. But the FinePix gives decent close-ups for about $150 against the body and lens at some 20x that price with the D300.So I say the FinePix XP10 is an overall fun camera. It's durable and ready to go.

Many photographers will recall that back when my camera was new, digital SLR's were primarily targeted to professionals and compact digital cameras had extremely limited functionality. Prosumer cameras were intended to bridge the gap between these two types of camera by offering image sensors, zoom capabilities, and exposure controls that were better than those on point-and-shoot cameras but just below the level required for professional work.*There aren't really any prosumer cameras on the market these days because point-and-shoot cameras, including the Finepix XP10, now contain a lot of the features that prosumer cameras have. In addition, digital SLR kits have become a lot more affordable. So, prosumer cameras have been squeezed out from both above and below.*Even though the prosumer category has disappeared, the cameras still produce better images than most current compacts due to their relatively large image sensors.My review perspective*I'm using the Finepix XP10 as a fun, casual camera. In other words, I'm using it for times when fine control over composition and exposure isn't necessary (party shots, for example) or in places where there is a high risk of damage to my main camera (such as beaches and pools).*I'm not overly concerned with all the various aspects of image quality when using this camera. I'm not going to spend much time editing or critiquing the photos. If it takes pictures that are attractive to the eye with a minimum of fuss, it's doing its job.What I like*The camera is compact and light. It's roughly the length and width of a computer mouse, with the thickness of a slim TV remote control.*The battery charger is compact as well, around the size of a clamshell cell phone. Even better, the charger has an integrated plug so no cord is necessary.*Picture quality is good enough for snapshots, especially in daylight with stationary subjects.*The camera body is sealed up well, with rubber gaskets protecting buttons and the battery/memory card door, and seems to be rugged.What I don't like*No viewfinder. Call me old school, but I prefer framing shots through a viewfinder. Peering at a screen at arm's length just doesn't feel natural to me.*Screen has low resolution and washes out easily. This sometimes makes it difficult to see if a shot is going to come out the way you want before tripping the shutter.*Doesn't use Compact Flash memory cards. I have a number of CF cards from my main camera and can't use them with the Finepix.*Flash is weak and really only effective close in.*No lens cap or lens cover. The lens is only protected by a pane of glass. It's pretty easy to get this glass dirty or, even worse, scratched if you're not careful.*No good way to set it down unless you buy a case or cover. The camera is fairly thin on the top, bottom, and side edges. This makes the camera easy to carry and hold but forces you to put the camera down on either the lens or the screen.Other notes*The camera comes with only 13Mb of internal memory. A typical high resolution photo taken with this camera is 3Mb, so most users will want to purchase an SD or SDHC memory card as well.*Mac owners don't need to install any software. Apple's iPhoto reads memory cards formatted by the camera without any problems (I use an i7 iMac with System 10.6.4 and iPhoto 8.1.2).*Fujifilm doesn't include many accessories in the base kit. A flotation strap is available as part of the XP10 Accessory Kit.Bottom line*All in all, the Finepix XP10 does exactly what I want it to do. It produces nice snapshots quickly and easily. It can be used in places where I don't want to take my main camera. The things I don't like are common to all point-and-shoot cameras, except for the lack of some kind of built-in protection for the glass covering the lens.

Unfortunately the Canon is a large expensive camera and isn't something I would want to take to the water park or the beach or mountain climbing and it certainly doesn't fit in my pocket.  I needed a camera that I could use that I wouldn't be afraid to take with me through life's more rustic adventures.I opted for the Fuji FinePix XP10 due mainly for the price and the fact that it is advertised as a small and durable camera.What the camera is good at:1)  If fits nicely in my pocket.  Not much bigger than a cell phone.2)  It is both a digital camera and a video camera.  This saves me big time.3)  It looks cute.4)  It takes decent pictures and video for the price.5)  Controls are intuitive and easy to use.What the camera is not good at:1)  The 12MP is a joke.  Coming from a real 12MP camera (the Canon Rebel) I can tell you that the true resolution of a digital image isn't just about the number of pixels but how sharp the optics are.  The Fuji falls way short here.  Not a huge deal for such an inexpensive camera. I save a tremendous amount of room on the camera by shooting at 6MP, which is really about all the optics can handle.  If you want 12MP, just take your original at 6MP and double the size in Photoshop later.  The quality will be about the same.2)  Zooming while taking a video is a joke.  The zoom motor is clearly heard... I mean it drowns out almost any other sound.  And, it looses focus completely.  If doing video, it is best to leave the zoom alone.3)  Delay between pushing the button and taking the picture.  I must admit I've become quite spoiled with my Canon in this department.  Push the shutter and the picture is taken instantly.  With the Fuji, there is about a 1/4 second delay.  When trying to take a picture of a running kid most of my shots are of their feet or back.

The HD video (720p resolution) is just gorgeous.Downsides are: shooting video picks up finger-friction squeak and creak noises, sound recording MAY have changed slightly (?) after shooting underwater, not sure on that one, maybe just subjective, and there is no lens cover so it seems completely susceptible to scratches, however I have closely monitored that part of it and I don't see a single scratch after months of (reasonably rough!) use. If they would just include a neoprene case, it would  be perfect.White balance controls are good...you do have the option of an indoor incandescent setting, although it does seem like it overreaches past natural colors.

Bright daylight was about the only time it worked well; anytime I took pictures indoors, I soon got in the habit of snapping four or five of them at a time, in the hopes that maybe one of them would look halfway-decent. There was a distinct orange/reddish tint to most of my pictures, and it didn't matter what shooting mode the camera was in or what adjustments I tried making to it. The pictures simply tended to be garbage (and video quality looked just as bad the couple of times I tried using that as well). But, at least at first, it did seem to be reasonably waterproof; it got wet when I got caught in the rain a few times, and still seemed to work fine afterwards.About eleven months after I bought it, it one day simply stopped working. It had been sitting in a drawer for a few weeks, so at first I thought that maybe it was the battery (battery life was abysmal as well, by the way). But it simply would not turn on, even after the battery was fully charged. I called Fuji, and they wouldn't offer me any guarantees that any repairs would be covered under warranty, but they did offer to at least look at it for free. Three weeks after I sent it, I still hadn't heard anything back, so I called them - and was told, quite literally, that no tech people had gotten around to taking it out of the box yet, but that they'd get on it right away! In all fairness, they did get to it right away after I called, but I was annoyed that I'd had to call in the first place just to get them to pay any attention to my camera.A few days later, Fuji sent back my camera, with the motherboard replaced, at no charge due to the fact that it was still (barely) within the first twelve months of ownership. If my camera had waited just a few more weeks to die, and/or if I'd discovered it was broken just a few weeks later than I actually did, I guess I would have been completely up a creek.Speaking of creeks... my newly-fixed camera worked for a little over a year afterwards, and then died on a camping trip when I had the gall to take my allegedly waterproof camera into a lake with me to snap pictures of fish. The camera was theoretically rated for up to 3 meters down (10 feet-ish), and I certainly did not go deeper than that in the lake while it was in my bathing suit pocket; but come the next morning, there was condensation inside the lens and inside the LCD, and the camera was unresponsive. Keep in mind that this allegedly \"waterproof\" camera actually had a shooting mode for taking pictures underwater, so it's not as if Fuji was exactly trying to *discourage* people from using it underwater.So, yeah, in summary: horrible pictures, and \"waterproofing\" that didn't actually protect it from full submersion.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money on this dog!", "Author": "David Flory", "ReviewID": "R1TTIG913EU1MZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this camera about two years.

Unfortunately, it's quite pricey for a disposable camera, which is what mine seems to have turned out to be. I bought it for a snorkeling and kayaking trip to Hawaii - thinking it wiser than employing one of the fancy zip-lock \"camera bags\" for my better quality equipment.  Hard to say, in the end.Photo quality, buttons, menus, features are all quite marginal. Not bad for the price, but not up to current standards either. The underwater shots I got seemed surprisingly good (to me), but those taken above the surface were not up to the quality of even my older Canon point-and-shoots. The tiny, tiny lens is very difficult to get sufficiently dry after a dunking to then take dry shots without water droplets in the frame. The buttons and d-pad are awfully small for even my fairly small fingers. The LCD screen is awful - not bright enough for daylight and too reflective to use underwater - and there is not rangefinder to use when you can't see the LCD. The actual images produced are large, but we have a case of megapixel inflation again - a large number of low quality pixels on a very small image sensor do not a better camera make.  Still and all, had it lasted more than a week on vacation, it would have  been good value for easy underwater or surf snapshots... and it was fun to play with.Unfortunately, despite being obsessive about only opening and closing the battery/memory door either indoors or inside the car (where I could be sure to keep seals and hinges clean), the system failed after about 4 shallow snorkeling expeditions - and before our long kayak trip around Na'Pali.  Simply stopped turning on. Moisture could be seen at the bottom of the battery bay with a flashlight, although it was not really full of water.  Ironically I ended up buying and using a Fujifilm disposable camera for the kayak trip. The photos were only slightly inferior to what the digital camera had been producing.Afraid I can't recommend it for anything other than perhaps outdoor use where only light rain or extremes of temperature might be an issue.

Well, I took this camera to a water park and held it in place while I was going down water slide and recorded videos of it, then I took it to the wavepool and took pictures under the water and videos of me and my friends swimming, and I say that the quality's great, I was quite impressed, I had everyone looking at me with envy at this camera (or maybe they just thought we were weird lol).

The camera does all that well. Sand, dust, snow, or steam do not damage the camera. In terms of durability it is a 5 star camera. I jumped off a 40 foot cliff while taking video and the video was on until a couple seconds after impact, the shock made the video stop but the camera continued to work. I have captured amazing moments of water action that would have been impossible with a normal camera.All that stated, here is what this camera does NOT do so great, the shutter speed from when you click on the picture button to when the picture gets taken is somewhat slow. The picture quality is ok to good most of the time, sometimes there are excellent shots and sometimes the quality is not good (flash can be very bright with no way to adjust it). The lense is small so in terms of picture quality, it is a bit limited. For the price and what it is designed for, it is a fun camera. I am glad I own it. Other cameras in this category that are better are about $300, for the price, this camera delivers good value. I like that it has an easy to use video button for easy access to video when you need it. I have taken it to the snow and fell on it with my body weight and it still kept on ticking! I also like the action pouch it comes with. If you like action vacations or activities this a great inexpensive camera to capture cool moments and a camera that can handle a beating from drops, dust, sand, and water.", "Date": "January 28,

Easy to use, takes GREAT daytime photos and close night flash snapshots.  Doesn't do well with night distance shots (skylines, etc).  Bright daylight pictures are awesome.  Camera is waterproof, I swam with it, walked in the rain, in and out of air conditioning and never fogged up.  One nice feature is a clear piece of glass covers the lens assembly that's easily wiped clean with your t shirt.  Also has a video record feature that works pretty good.  Check out the fireworks video posted here, recorded with the FUJI XP10.  Battery life is good, I charged it every other day or so.  Charges in about 45 minutes.  I accidently dropped it a couple of times, once on a ceramic tile floor, still works.  Battle scar on the case, that's it.I experimented with all the different settings and settled on AUTO.  Let the camera decide what to do.  One thing I really liked is the delay between the time you press the button until it takes the picture is MUCH faster that previous cameras I've owned.  You get the shot you want.  Overall, for the money, it's a good deal.Pros: Small, fits in back pocket of blue jeans, fast power up, takes great daytime photos, waterproof, shockproof, decent video recorder, easy to use.Cons: Not too good in low light distance shots.  Maybe all digital cameras are like this, I don't know.  Close flash shots are great.Family alert: There is a reference to drinking in the video, the word 'drunk' is used.*****  UPDATE  ******July 2012After 18 months of loyal, durable and sometimes less than gentle use, it died.  :(Don't know what happened, but on my 3rd trip to Jamaica with this camera, it quit.  It didn't leak, good thing, the memory card was fine, pictures were there.  It just quit.  Not totally broken-hearted, she gave me great service for $125.

I can't find the option to upload images (only video) so I can't show the sharpened images.The ergonomics are great, and it slips easily in a pocket or bathing suit.I wish the lens was a little faster like at least f/3.5 or better yet f/2.8.  The flash comes on in light that I consider sufficient.  That function can be turned off, but then the images are slightly blurry.  This camera requires more light to perform than I am used to on my G9 and D90.I think for the price ($145.00), it's a bargain; shockproof, waterproof and dust proof.  When I use it in water I tape a piece of electricians tape over the battery/memory card door as a precautionary measure.I'm glad I purchased this camera, it's a kick!Update; I thought the images were a little too soft, so I adjusted the picture quality from the default setting of normal to fine, and the difference is substantial, so I don't feel the need to do any sharpening in post processing.I also am finding that fill flash is necessary even in moderately low light, unless you are fond of blurry images.All in all, I'm quite pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Waterproof?

It's a good camera for me, takes basic pictures and seems fairly indestructible, but pictures in low light turn out really spotty when they don't blur and it is hard to see the screen in sunlight.

Facial recognition worked well, and I liked the clear piece of glass over the shutter, very handy when taking pics in the rain. I liked the fact there were no exterior moving parts.I found a couple of things I did not like about the unit, though.  The pictures were quite soft and not nearly as clear as I had hoped.  I found myself taking three or four photos of the same thing in an attempt to get a better, more clear photo.  When comparing the pics I was taking with a friend who had a Samsung camera, I found his were way clearer.I also noted that when the unit was placed in \"silent\" mode, the flash was supressed, period.  The reason for this still confuses me, as I  prefer to take pics without the obligatory \"snapshot sounds\" but could not do so without losing the flash capability of the camera.I also noted that the gray finish on the body had started to wear off after a short 5 days of use on this trip.At the end of the day, I decided to return the camera and continue looking for a compact unit that produces better photos, and doesn't show wear so quickly.

While at the Beach one day, I decided to take the camera out on the a in the ocean to get some pictures of the beach.  While on the raft, we were overturned by a wave and came crashing into the surf. My camera slipped off my wrist and was sucked back into the waves.  I was heartbroken, it was the last day of vacation and all my photos were lost!  By some miracle my brother found the camera stuck in a tide pool as the tide receeded.  I was extatic thinking ok well I am sure the camera is trashed, but hopefully the memory card is still intact.

Encased in a sleek, tapered shell, the camera looks good, is lightweight, and fits neatly in one hand.  The video quality is not the highest, but we have no complaints about single images (including of activity).  There is a slight delay in shutter speed, particularly if the flash is used, but it becomes less of an issue as one gets more familiar with the camera.  That slight user issue is also offset by the easy portability of the camera itself.  While you may occasionally regret not having a faster camera if you are already engaged in a photo shoot, I like to carry my XP10 around in my shirt pocket all day just in case something noteworthy crops up.  In other words, it makes a great, light, utilitarian camera for sightseeing, hiking, or other activities where you may come across worthy photos as part of a larger experience, and don't want to lug a bigger more expensive camera around the whole time.The XP10 bills itself as highly resistant to water intrusion, dust, or other environmental factors.  I haven't taken it in a lake yet myself, but it has indeed held up well to rigorous outdoor activities.  It's nice to not have to worry about your camera if you happen to be caught in a brief rainstorm or the like -- you don't even need to scramble for a camera case.  All in all, I've found the XP10 to be a very useful digital camera that functions well in the woods as well as at high energy birthday parties for the kids.  My wife even found a way to change the menus to Thai (her favorite language), so it can be used by many folks for whom English may not be their first language.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good waterproof camera for the money", "Author": "J.

We used it again this weekend, and the light was really strong overhead and the pictures came out great!  So darn cute, and the quality and detail were amazing. The look on the kids' faces when I said \"waterproof camera\" was awesome.  My daughter, her friends, my husband had so much fun taking pictures and videos that day.IMO, for a waterproof camera, it does not have to be super expensive because it has to withstand salt water, chlorine, sand.  For me, with this kind of destruction, I did not want to spend a lot of money, but I also did not want it to break apart with the first use.  The port for the USB cable is actually in the same chamber as the SD card and battery.  We have opened it 5 times since we have had the camera this past June (2 months) and we have not experienced any of the problems as some people described where water seeped in because the seal was broken.For the money, it was a great buy and we still enjoy it and likely will for a long time to come.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "great for outdoor water adventures", "Author": "Sumulator", "ReviewID": "R9DPBSRWREQC6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera does well in serving the function of being an outdoor waterproof camera.

I regularly needed to press the power button 3 times to turn it on and often the shooting button twice to take a picture.  Or I needed to apply so much pressure that I moved the camera as I shot.  Other people had the same problems when I handed the camera to others to shoot me in the picture.I was often in museums or sensitive sites where flash photography was not allowed, so I set it for natural light.  Photos often resulted with glare where none was visible to the eye in the natural light.  How does that happen?Furthermore, it may simply have too many functions for me and other basic users. It was annoying to scroll through the many options.  And some did not work well together for no apparent reason.  For example, you can't change the sounds while using certain other settings.Finally, the battery never lasted the entire day.

The camera takes really good pictures in low light and it performs well underwater.  The quality is good but not great for my underwater shots.  Even though it doesn't have HD video, the quality was good but the sound is not good.  I went snorkeling the whole week with this camera and never had a problem with leaks.  The battery does drain out if you don't turn it off after each shot.  I would leave it on at times while I was snorkeling so that I would have it ready when I wanted to snap a picture of a moray eel coming but found that I couldn't last a whole day with my battery.  The different modes were great and it ensured that I got good pictures.  As far as the camera body, the light green paint on the side where the model name was wore off completely within two days.  Maybe it had to do with the salt water.  Same thing with the plastic peeling off on the back of the control buttons.  My main pet peeve with this camera is that after about 3 days, after taking a picture; if I wanted to review, it would stick.  I would have to take the battery out for a few seconds and it would come back but sometimes it wouldn't.  Sometimes deleting the pictures would keep going if you don't stop it after 5 mins.  Seems like Fujifilm has some software issue that they need to work on.  This was my first experience with owning anything other than a Canon.  I've never experienced this with Canon ever.  I love the 5X optical zoom on this camera.  I wouldn't recommend this camera until they fix this software glitch.

Good thing, after about 2 weeks the camera stopped working, and I just completed the online return forms on Amazon and will be dropping it off at a UPS shipper tomorrow morning for a refund.Pros:  Fun, easy to use, used it in pools and snorkeling in Hawaii. Picture quality is pretty good for a camera at this price. I didn't use the video functions so I can't comment on that. I does have a slow shutter speed, but once you get used to it no problem.Cons: Too good to be true, first the display went out, then it stopped functioning, thankfully it died towards the end of our trip. Disappointing, it took some fairly good underwater pictures of sharks, fish and my kids. Never took the camera more than about 2 feet under water. specs on the camera say up to 3 meters -  I never got anywhere close to that deep.Major CON: The design of the memory card slot and battery slot are in a rather poor position. It has  a sealed section for the battery and memory card, however once you start using it you will notice the little door is directly beneath the shutter button on the bottom of the camera. When I hold a camera this small my index finger is on top - shutter, and thumb grips the bottom - where the door is at, I noticed the little door sliding back and forth a little, never opening just slightly moving when taking land and water pictures.  I don't know if that's what killed the camera or not. It did die in the water though.

Acceptable day time shots, slightly better than I expected.3. Water proof shots, with enough light, are very nice. This was a pleasant surprise. I got some great underwater shots of the kids.4. HD video is great underwater! Video controls are very easy, a start and stop right on the camera back.5. Battery life seemed fine, I shot more than 100 shots a day and still had plenty of charge. Comes with a nice, compact battery charger.6. Small & compact, slides in your swim pants pocket easily and doesn't weigh much.Cons:1. The controls are very awkward to use, especially in or under water. Buttons and shutter placement should have been better thought out. I would think big, round, easy to find by touch buttons would be the way to go on a camera you are going to use under water. Not stylish, slippery, recessed little buttons. It takes some getting used to, at first I really disliked it.2. Focus problems - in 2010, even for a \"budget\" camera there should not be focus problems, especially in daylight. Also the camera had some problems focussing when shooting video. I had several clips & pics I had to delete as they were out of focus. Grrrr.3. The camera makes a very loud \"whirrring\" noise that can be heard if you use the zoom while recording. Basically, do NOT zoom while recording video or it'll sound like the Transformers are attacking.4. The \"SR Auto\" (auto scene recognition) was useless. There is an under water mode but even when I was under water the SR Auto could not detect it. You really need to manually change the scene settings to get the best shots. I am assuming many people might not ever figure this out as SR Auto is the default shooting mode.I am not sure if I am going to keep this camera.

I ended up choosing the Fuji FinePix XP10, because it said it fit these requirements and more.  I've used the camera for several events now, and like some aspects and dislike some others.  The camera provides high-quality pictures, at 12 MP, images are crisp and sharp.  Color saturation of images is very good.  It is easy to use and self-explanatory, I can hand the camera to another crew-member and they can figure it out quickly and without problems.I do have a couple of issues with the camera, though, simple things that would make it more practical and easier to use.  First,to turn off the beep sound (chime when camera is turned on/off, or when using the menu), you are required to hold a button down for 4 seconds - but this also cancels the flash - there is no way to turn off the beep without turning off the flash function.  It doesn't make sense to have to tie these two functions together electronically.  Second, although it has a large viewing screen, it is very difficult to see in bright daylight.  You are required to hold a hand over the screen to see the image - not handy when sailing a boat!  Third, the telephoto length of the lens is shorter than I would have liked.  It is hard to frame a distance shot using only the telephoto control.  I've figured that this is a symptom of the water-proof nature of the camera, for longer focal length, it would require a moving lens.  Finally, on my last camera, it was possible to enlarge and crop a picture while viewing it on the screen, this camera does not appear to have that option.The camera does what it promised, so I rate it high for those reasons.  I guess with a little more research on my part, I would have found that it lacked a couple of features that I had come to consider necessary for the type of photography I do.Fujifilm FinePix XP10 12 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Green)", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Melisa M.

None of the shots I took outdoors on a summer evening at 6 PM (still 2+ hours of sunlight left) was any good. blurry, unsharp, bad autofocus... nothing good to say about it.

I like the blurriness effect on two of the shots, but that is being generous.My everyday camera is a Nikon D3 with a Nikon Lens AF-S NIKKOR 24-70mm f/2.8G ED.It shoots amazing stills in low light, lightning autofocus, rapid multiframes.I got the Finepix x10 for its dustproof attribute, but I really don't think I can use it/enjoy it.", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice idea, but has some flaws", "Author": "CAW Mom \"A Widay\"", "ReviewID": "R2AY6964488U92", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought the camera to use on vacation in Hawaii.

Too many times I've missed shots because my camera was safely tucked away in a dry bag. Looking at the shots after our vacation, I'm very excited about my purchase! Having been a very satisfied Canon customer for a number of years, I had initially looked at the comparable D10; however, when I met a fellow traveler with the D10, I was even more convinced I had purchased the right camera (it was a bit bulkier than the Fuji).PROS--SizeThe Fuji fits perfectly in my front pocket whereas the D10 was a little too big for my liking.--Start up timeI was really impressed with how little time it took from pocket to picture--I was able to get some great wildlife shots while kayaking.--BatteryI was able to hold a charge and take over 300 pictures over 2 days. Charging took less than an hour.--StyleI didn't buy this to impress people, I just wanted a camera that could get wet--but every time I took it out, people seemed to comment on it (I have the green one).--Waterproof-nessI took pictures in sea water and fresh water (no deeper than an arm's length) with no problems. I'm excited to snorkel with it sometime soonCONS--SoundI haven't found a way to turn off the somewhat annoying start up sound, zoom sound and snapshot sound without also suppressing the flash--DisplayBecause the camera fits easily in a pocket, it's prone to getting scratched with whatever may be in your pocket (change, keys). Mine got a very small scratch on Day 1. Also, there is no viewfinder, so all pictures need to be framed with the display.I did like the picture quality, and the video was decent at best.All in all, I highly recommend this camera for someone who wants to be outdoors, take pictures, and not worry about equipment getting wet.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "S.

Not the best night time/dark shots, but I have not found a point and shoot that does a good job in low light.  Pictures at a distance are very good too - for a point and shoot camera.  Not perfect pictures when sitting in the back of the auditorium at my children's concerts, but definitely better than most point and shoots.I have taken a lot of video with this camera, and the quality is excellent.  My only complaint is the lack of a pause feature while taking video.  When you select the video option, it automatically starts recording, rather than waiting for you to push a button to start recording.  This has caused many videos to start with scenes of the floor, or my lap, etc, then quickly panning up to the subject!  And when you stop, that video clip is over, and you have to start another clip to continue.  No way to stop/pause/restart and keep it all in one video.The lens does not \"close\", and there is no cover for the lens, which worried me at first, but after owning it for so long, and using it regularly in many different situations, I'm happy to report the lens is in great shape.  I would have expected it to be scratched and ruined by now, but no.Battery life is great, and the charger is compact and easy to take along.  Recharges the battery quickly as well.I plan to use this camera for a long time, and am very happy with it.

I have lost a different camera (and my daughter's first summer) due to a cracked lens, so I'm particularly sensitive to this issue.Another feature that I would have liked this camera to come with is a floating leash: But I just looped the camera strap to my bathing suit shoulder strap to keep it from getting away from me. I guess if they made the camera floatable too then it would be too bulky to tuck into a pocket.All in all, I'm very pleased with the camera.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "picture quality not as expected", "Author": "Gerardo G.

I have taken it on two different snorkel trips and it has worked fine.  I must add that I bought this specifically for underwater video use, and that anyone who is expecting stellar pictures/video from it should look elsewhere.  Here are a few items of note:Pros:1.  Worked underwater over a two-year period on two different 10-day snorkel trips.  Submerged in water for dozens and dozens of hours, with no leaks.2.  Video is descent.3.  Battery life isn't too bad.  I had it in the water for up to two hours at a time on one battery, with the camera on (LCD in auto dim mode).Cons:1.  While the video and pictures are not bad, there are cameras in this same class that take much better pictures and video.  I would only look at this for the underwater capability.2.  I wish the video was 1080p, instead of 720p, but I knew that when I bought it.3.  Has trouble sometimes with autofocus.  In reviewing the video that was taken, about 5% - 10% would be blurry.There are more highly rated underwater cameras available that take 1080p video. If I was able to use it more often than I do, I would invest in one of those.

It was rained on and dunked in the ocean and still works. We did not use it to take any underwater pictures. The 5x zoom made this waterproof camera stand out among others in the same price range for me.What I didn't like about the camera - no lens cover. Some of our shots were ruined because the plastic lens had sunscreen or fingerprints on it. I'm also not a fan of the scene recognition auto mode. When you want to take a quick picture, just use the regular auto mode. Sometimes when you are attempting to take a picture using scene recognition, it will make some bizarre choices based on lighting and motion in the frame. Also, indoors and night pictures didn't turn out so well either. However, that's what I've got a much nicer point and shoot for, this was meant to be a cheap outdoor camera from the start.Ultimately, worth the price I paid, but I wish I'd known to check and clean the lens with a soft cloth every time before snapping a picture.

So far, it's been great.During paddle boarding, the biggest risk it faces is me dropping it in the ocean (it doesn't float). I rarely fall in the water, but when I do, I know my camera is safe.  The camera gives allows me to paddle board without having to worry about ruining my camera if I fall.Pros:- It's affordable.- It's compact.- It's has a decent flash which I found quite handy for determining how much of the bow line I managed to get wrapped around the propeller of my buddy's boat.- The video feature works well.Negatives:- It doesn't float. I solved this issue by attaching a couple of key-ring floaties to it - foam key chains typically used by recreational boaters to keep their keys from sinking. Basically, it's a non-issue once you get the floating device.- Sand is it's mortal enemy.  I took this camera through the Camp Pendleton Mud Run- a 10-k run through water, obstacles and hills. While the camera handled the water and the occasional bumps during the obstacles, it didn't exactly like the sand and little rocks it encountered.  A few grains of sand slipped under the shutter button, making it difficult to take photos.  We were able to clean it out, but I must admit I thought the camera was done for.  Moral of the story, do not stick this in the sand.- Photo quality. It's not perfect.  But hey, it's only $100-$150 and it's a water proof camera! What more do you want.  I found that for taking normal photos (around the house or anywhere else on land), it's not the greatest camera. The photo's can appear a little hazy, especially with poor light. HOWEVER, in the water, this camera takes pretty good photos.I have not had any issues with moisture in the camera.  Then again, I live in a very dry climate and I don't usually leave it submerged in the water.

The other thing which I found weird is that you can't take high resolution pictures with it.The pictures it takes are great though, and I am pretty happy with them, but it would be nice if I could take high-res ones since the camera can take high-res video, which by the way, is very high quality.

With one day of use, the battery compartment popped open, without being dropped, and saltwater completely ruined the camera.  We took it back to exchange it.  Got a new one.I took it out on a paddle in fresh water.  As I was climbing back into my kayak, it dropped from my lap and into the water.  No problem, its shock proof and water proof.  I felt around at the bottom and fished the camera out only to find that yet again the battery compartment of this new one had popped open.  Not only did water get into the camera, but the battery ejected itself and was now somewhere in the murk.  Luckily with a few more minutes of fumbling in the cold alaskan waters, I found it.  The camera fell at most 3 inches off of my lap into the the water then sank about 12 inches - this wouldn't even be enough of an impact to break a glass.  Shock proof NO, water proof NO.  I took it home and dried it out in rice.  Turns on and takes a picture but the lenses are shot!

I'd used that camera for years and was consistently impressed with its photo abilities. Its sharpness, color saturation and especially long exposure shots were all darn good. Really good. I'm a 20-year professional photojournalist and wedding photographer, so my eye is fairly well trained as to what to look for in camera capabilities - and the Pentax fit the bill. However, this is about the Fujifilm XP. I was attracted by its price, design, and positive reviews from those who seemed to know what they're talking about. My impressions, after three months of use, are below.First off, you'll notice that this Fuji is shaped a bit oddly. Like regular point-and-shoot was sort of squished in from the sides and top. It's almost got a pear-like shape - which I like. With this design, it fits well in the hand, even pretty big mitts like mine, and doesn't feel too tiny. Its screen is a little bigger than 2\"x 1 1/2\". That is a good sized screen and compares better than my Optio's.Like most point-and-shoot digitals, the Fuji gives you way too many options for settings. Programs for shooting portraits, programs for photographing pigeons in flight at night, and programs for shooting portraits in a farm field while back lit and tilted at an angle. You get the idea. There must be more than two dozen program settings you can choose from. Overload, but I guess it's better than just a few to choose from. I usually just leave the darn thing on \"P\" - basically automatic and am pleased with what it does.As for the images. Wow. They're good. Usually. Using the standard color calibration (there are four settings to choose from) I've almost always been pleased with what I've gotten. I take about 90% of my shots outside, under varying light situations (harsh daylight, soft cloud light, sunsets). However, I must note that from what I've seen so far, the Fuji XP doesn't handle highlights real well. If the camera chooses a mid-range exposure, and there are areas of the photo that have real bright light on them - well the Fuji treats them pretty harsh. I've noticed that most other cameras don't have problems with highlights, but so far, it's my only real complaint - and seeing that I basically got this camera for under $150, I'm not really worried about it.The only other slight complaint would be with the positioning/size of the camera's controls. I know Fuji had to pack a lot of stuff onto a 12 megapixel camera that's about 3 1/2 x 2 1/2\", but the camera's power button is so tiny and difficult to punch on, that it's bound to frustrate more than one person. Also, the camera's rear control panel, that gives you access to the its programs, images, and delete functions are all clustered in a vertical strip on the right, encased in a waterproof little bubble thing that, again, if you've got man-sized digits, might be a little tough to navigate. But I have and can get around them, so it's not too bad a deal.As for it's waterproof-abilities. I really haven't had the thing too deep in water in order to adequately tell you what I think. I've had it about a foot below some fresh water, taking video of fish I've caught, and the videos look great and the camera stayed dry. These are good things! The real test is when I take it to the Florida Keys in awhile. The Optio's worked flawlessly there over the years, and hopefully this Fuji XP will be up to snuff as well.I wish I could post a link to some of the photos I've taken with this camera. I think you'd be impressed. If you take them at maximum quality (as I usually try to) you'll find really nice images that are about 3 megabytes uncompressed.

I am aware of the problem of seeing images on the screen in bright sunshine, but this one is far worse than any other camera I have owned.  As someone else pointed out, it only makes a good mirror if you want to view your own image instead of the scene you are trying to film.  Both underwater (where it was really important to me) and otherwise, it was impossible to even see if the camera was turned on.  The little blue light was never visible underwater, so even that did not provide a clue.  As to picture quality:  very mixed results.  Some pictures were fairly good, but I get better pictures from other (even less expensive) cameras.  There were a number of pictures (above ground, not even underwater testing) where the images suddenly had a very deep purple or blue cast.

It's not just bad, it's unusable.  And there's something funky with mine, this 500ms on / 500ms off overwhelming humming noise, and no it's not the zoom... I'm guessing some electrical noise of some kind... maybe writing data to the flash card?

My 'regular use' camera is a 200IS, but when we decided to take our teens on a cruise this year, I KNEW I would need an underwater camera that had a low price point, yet some decent features. The Fuji seemed to fit the bill, and reviews were mixed.Got this camera about a month before cruise time, and of course I tested it out right away. Indoor pictures are AWFUL..worse than awful, they are horrible. BUT I had my Canon for that anyway. The first time underwater (hubby's fishtank).. I discovered that I hadn't sealed the battery compartment properly. Fortunately, there was only a rim of water around the seal..if you decide to purchase this camera, use extra caution when making sure the battery/camera card door is FIRMLY slid into place. One 'detractor' is the fact that there is no 'wrong way' to put in the battery..until you try to turn on the camera and find it won't turn on. Oops. Battery life is 'okay'..but I purchased two extra just in case. We did very well and easily got through our day on the beach with a single battery. We also purchased a floating strap from a different vendor..a wise investment, believe me!We used this camera in Grand Turk and La Romana and got some great pictures as well as great video both under water, and in.

I figure this will get shots I would normally pass on given the environment and conditions.My wife is the primary user, so the small FF and small buttons don't bother her.  She also can deal with the lack of a viewfinder, which I am conditioned to use.  Every single time I pick up the camera, I try to look through the non-existent viewfinder!The only nit (so far) is that I cannot find a way to get the replacement sealing gasket mentioned in the manual.  Fuji suggests changing it annually to maintain its waterproof capability.  The manual goes on to say \"at cost\" and contact the place where you purchased or Fuji repair. Figuring Amazon did not have the gasket, I called (and emailed) Fuji.  Responses were identical; send the unit in for \"repair.\"  I told them I just need the gasket (per the manual) and was not going to incur the shipping and repair costs for a $.50 rubber gasket that THEY recommend I replace.  I see this as a battle that will be fought for several months.  I can see a situation where I don't replace the gasket, the camera leaks, I send it in, and Fuji says \"if you had replaced the gasket, it wouldn't have leaked.\"If you own this camera and know how to get a new gasket (happy to pay for the part), please post something here for the rest of us (and Fuji).", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Would only use as a second camera", "Author": "Caleb Lamz", "ReviewID": "R19T6BHIFXFJ3W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We have two little boys and thought a tough, waterproof camera would be really useful.

Unless you are in perfect lighting, the pictures end up either blurry, overexposed, or grainy.  For the price of this camera, I wasn't expecting much, but I would venture to guess that over half of our pictures have some type of issue.  I know the camera is not defective, because there are some pictures that come out fine. We're not camera novices, either.  I've used digital cameras for over 10 years and understand how to adjust the settings.The people that claim this camera takes great pictures either were lucky enough to have taken them in excellent lighting, or they are comparing it to a digital camera they bought 10 years ago.  We are comparing it to a Canon SD1000 that was about 3 years old.  That camera was nothing special, but the picture quality was far better than this Fuji.The waterproof and toughness features of this camera are great, but the poor image quality doesn't make it worth it.

It's always a pure guess, and I've learned to stand very still until I'm positive the camera is finished doing it's thing.  The on/off button is hard to operate.  Response time is slow, slow, slow - with every function, including reviewing and deleting pictures, which is most irritating.  I don't like the computer software at all, and it over-rides my Canon software, which I do like. (The Fuji software starts, when I plug in my Canon, which is over-ridable but a pain).

I have not and will not purposely dunk this camera in water.  I DO like this camera at work, where I take a lot of technical pictures, indoors, with wet hands and environment.  I have quality photographs from this camera, especially when I can see what I'm shooting at.  I haven't dropped it yet, but it does appear to be quite rugged, which I like.  I took one video of the TV, and that seemed okay.  All in all, I'm glad I bought this camera - ONLY because it was a cheap way for me to experiment with a 5X zoom, and I really do need something waterproof for work.  My biggest complaint is not being able to see what I'm shooting through the LCD.  I can't imagine using it this winter in the snow, as the brighter the atmosphere, the harder it is to see anything.

With sunlight and open spaces, pictures look great. For indoor use, pictures look kind of \"sepia\", it does not get indoor ilumination that good. Video is good on standart resolution; shooting on HD quality produced a trembling image when the camera is moving, although it claims to have a stabilization feature. I 'm yet to try shooting on a class 6 SD card (mine is class 4), to see if the increased speed can solve this \"shaking video\" problem on HD resolution. Audio gets ambient sound and the shooter voice, but almost nothing of other people's voices. There's a problem with the mike: it's placed right where it's intuitive for you to hold the camera, so you have to get used to hold the camera on a not-so-natural way in order not to cover the mike. The waterproofing is great, I've taken the camera on a fishing trip and it took some baths in muddy water, droppped on sand and other stuff like that, and no problem at all. It takes SDHC cards (faster than regular SD cards) up to 16GB, wich is more than enough for me (holds approx. 2500 photos at 12MP resolution, or 1h HD video, splited on 12 min chunks - it's a restriction on the max file size the camera can hold, wich I believe it holds for most cameras).

My response to those people are - so what? I own a high-end Canon PowerShot SX210IS camera and my fianc\u00e9 owns a Canon Rebel XT SLR. Those are our cameras for taking the 'good' photos. The XP10 is for taking photos in places where I wouldn't want my $300, or her $600 camera, to be. Specifically - near water!This camera was great when we brought it to the beach last month, and plan to again soon. I could bring it out and take photos and videos wherever I wanted, without worrying that my hands were wet or sandy. That alone made the camera worth the purchase. It let me get the shots I wanted without having to compromise anything because of fear of getting a camera wet and breaking it.I even took this camera into the ocean with me, in the waves, and had some fun. Photos above and below the water (never, ever, take photos below the water in NJ, ew). Videos of the waves crashing into me. The only fear I had during this was the camera strap not holding on tight (it is pretty flimsy). I actually just solved this by buying a strap from Nintendo's website usually used for their Wii Remotes for $1 + shipping. Can't go wrong there!My only concern with the camera is the battery compartment. It's a normal flimsy battery compartment and I really hope it doesn't break because that will be the end of the waterproof part. Not sure what can be done to make that more sturdy.As for quality? My photos look absolutely fine, for what I was trying to take pictures of. Family, friends, sand and water on a bright day. Would I use this camera for other occasions? Maybe. But I do have my other cameras for that, but this would be a great backup.So in short - if you are looking for a camera that can survive the ocean, sand, and pools and that just happens to be able to take pretty good photos AND HD video - this is great. Let's not forget it's cheap and durable as well!If you are looking for a digital camera that can take amazing photos and videos and just happens to be able to survive water - well, don't complain when this camera isn't what you expected it to be.

I'm old school this way. I like to hold the camera up to my face, look through an optical viewfinder, and even focus manually at times before taking a photograph. But there are times when I want to take photos in the rain, or at the beach, or at a water park, or on vacation where I can't be bothered carrying around a heavy SLR and extra lenses. So at those times, I often find myself with only my cellphone camera, which hardly takes quality photographs.The Fujifilm FinePix XP10 has some incredible benefits over the big SLR's. The major selling point - it can get wet, and not simply damp from a few raindrops, but rather falling-into-the-pool wet with no damage whatsoever. My iPhone can't get wet. And my Canon sure can't get wet. So this is a big deal even without having any interest in underwater photography. Next up - bang-proof. Perfect. I handed it over to my 6 year old to test it out. He played with it for a day, outside, inside, with friends...took over 100 photos. All at his 6 year old height, which actually brought out some pretty interesting photos. He dropped it, banged it against something when he didn't have a hammer at hand, and quickly learned how to both shoot and review photos. At the end of the day, he returned the camera with no evidence whatsoever that he had ever touched it. So it passes the 6-year-old-boy test. So the camera is perfect for the waterpark, the beach, and it weighs nothing so you can put it in your front pants pocket or even your shirt pocket without the weight being an issue.There are tradeoffs, of course. The lens is fairly small, so while the software is excellent with a 12MP resolution, you shouldn't expect the equivalent of what you'd get with 12MP in an older Canon Digital Rebel. What you'll miss is the absolute crystal clarity of the larger lenses. But you'll certainly get a photo that you can blow up to 8x10 should you desire without difficulty. It's a bit difficult to hold the camera perfectly steady to take a photo, and I find it hard, without bringing it to my eye, to line it up so that it is parallel with my subject and perpendicular to the ground. It may be that this lack of steadiness is what has caused my photos to be less sharp than I'm used to as I'm finding that the photos have improved with time and understanding of the product. The battery is also quite small, and battery life can go quickly particularly if you're using this as a video camera. But then the battery charges quickly and the charger is small and portable. Charge it up each night, like your cellphone, and you'll be fine.I had no difficulty connecting the camera to my Mac computer and getting all the photos into iPhoto without any software installation. Note that the USB port in the camera is an unusual micro-variety, so don't lose the included cord or forget to bring it with you on a trip. I think the FujiFilm is precisely as promoted...a wonderfully portable camera with a wide variety of potential applications for both still and video photography, all at a reasonable price. Considering that not that many years ago we were looking at Kodak Instamatics as the only potential beach camera, we've really come forward a long long way.Addendum: one year later. The camera still takes nice photos and the battery still works. It's never been dropped, but the little door at the bottom that seals out water and hides the battery and USB port no longer latches closed. Instead it just hangs open. Obviously, the camera is no longer waterproof and the little door has to be held closed with tape to keep it out of the way. It looks like the plastic design for the door latch has tolerances that are just too fine -- the loss of even a small amount of plastic prevents the door from working anymore. It's too bad -- nice camera but poor design of the battery door.Addendum: two years later. I was able to remove the door and carefully bend the appropriate sections of it back into line. It works again, and the unit is again waterproof. The camera continues to work nicely and the original battery is holding up well.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pictures are Terrible", "Author": "Frederick W.

I am disappointed with the camera & Fuji service.Fujifilm FinePix XP10 12 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Green)", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wish I hadn't broken our Canon Powershot", "Author": "Kim Ostermyer", "ReviewID": "R6DTTIYMJJLBP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace our Canon Powershot A1100IS, which I had inadvertently dropped and had a camera to floor collision. Had I known the replacement was going to be of considerably less quality, I would have fixed the Delorian and gone back in time to prevent my clumsiness.Appearance: It's a sleek camera and it easily fits in any pocket. Very lightweight and seems to be pretty durable.Picture quality: Eh. Very hit or miss. One of the flaws of this camera is that there seems to a considerable delay with the shutter speed from the point of pushing the button to the point of capturing the image. We're talking like the delay of a second or so, which may not seem like much, but photographic terms it is. I have two little boys who move very quickly and so a quick image capture is rather important. I can tell you that with the Canon A1100, I was able to capture our oldest son playing with a water hose and the water drops in flight as he waved the hose around. We were also able to capture 3-4 pictures of him going down a single slide while playing the park. With the Fujifilm, you *might* be able to squeeze off 2 pics before the kiddo is off the slide and off to some other playground feature.I have taken a couple thousand pictures with the camera since buying it last August and, for its size and price, it does could get you by if you needed something cheap before buying a great camera. I have taken a few pictures with this camera that I can say were awesome. Unfortunately, and this is with most cameras this size, blowing up the picture to an 8x10 tends to reduce overall clarity. One needs to keep in mind that if you do plan on blowing pictures up, plan your shots so when you crop them, you won't have to sacrifice limbs or appendages to make the shot fit into pictures beyond the 4x6 size.While not a major selling point, I found the sepia filter to be very great with its range of tone and color. Very cool to snap photos of kids with the old-timey look.Two major issues for use:The Battery: It can and will go in backwards (not upside down) and is not a unique shape that insures proper installation without looking at it or putting it in hoping its in correctly. The life of the battery is decent, but moderate use seems to require quite a bit of time on the charger. It is also a unique camera battery and does not offer the flexibility that a point and shoot camera should have. A more reasonable design would have put two AA batteries as the power source instead of a battery that requires a wall charger. I find this to be an annoyance as I'm not always going to somewhere with my camera where I can plug it in--but I am more than likely able to pickup a few AA batteries at a local gas station if nothing else.Another issue with this camera is that occasionally it freezes when reviewing the pictures. Upon pressing the button, it will show the most recent picture and will freeze on that picture. Removing the battery and putting it back in fails to correct this.Something that I like about the Canon A1100 was that the lens retracted when not in use. There was never any concern about whether or not carrying the camera in the same pocket with my keys would lead to scratches on the glass. With the Fujifilm, I'm constantly making sure that it is in a pocket free of anything that might scratch the glass covering the lens. While the body is pretty sound (haven't used it under water yet), I'm constantly concerned over scratches.I would recommend this camera as maybe a starter camera for the grandchild or maybe a scorned lover. But if you want a camera with more bang for your buck, get the Canon A1100.

If it is a waterproof camera surely the idea would be for users not to open the camera case too frequently...well the battery is the not helping this.This camera comes with a battery that you have to put into a charger docket and plug the charger to the wall socket. The charger docket will charge the battery which then you have to insert into its slot in the camera.\"tiny\" design issue here is that this camera will be used by tourists a lot..there is only 1 charger docket supplied and it is a tiny piece of plasticy thing the first item a tourist will loose when on the road.Why not a USB cable or a cable of any kind to charge the battery which is locked in the camera case? Why all the hassle of opening the case, placing into a docket and charging it outside of the camera....I have also ordered the Fuji Kit for the flotable strap- it is supposed to be exchangeable to a normal strap. Not mine. However hard I try, I can not unplug the flotable strap to swap to the normal..But it is water and beachproof, takes decent photos underwater so despite I have to be on alert not to loose the battery charger docket it does the job - but definately not replacing my \"normal\" camera...", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "This camera has lots of issues", "Author": "kdy", "ReviewID": "R264K6S31QZVBM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wish I never purchased this camera. Let's go through the good, the bad, and the ugly.  THE GOOD 1) Size and weight - it is easily portable. 2)It does have some nice menu features that allow you to adjust the camera to take pictures in various environments such as text, portraits, panoramic, etc. 3)It's easy to use.  THE BAD 1) Shutter speed is super slow, 2) Camera takes a long time to focus, 3) There is a very long pause between shots.  THE UGLY 1)The pictures are horrible - no matter which setting you use.  2) Not one shot is every in good focus 3) Camera stinks at taking shots indoors - even with decent lighting. 4) It's great that you can take this underwater but the casing leads to various problems - condensation buildings on the plexi glass that covers the lens so some pictures look cloudy or have what appears to have bubbles on them.  This casing makes it difficult for the lens to focus on anything.  I would say that 1 out of every 25 or so pictures turns out \"pretty good.\"  If you choose to buy this camera, play around with it immediately to see for yourself so that you have time to return it.
