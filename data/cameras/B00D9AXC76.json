However, watching your len and view will show a circular cut off. Did make for me some neat shots but it can cut off some great areas in the shot. Some shots may cause a out of focus soft look around the edges. But have fun with it. Still have not gotten to use all the filters so will update", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wrong item received!", "Author": "Richard Bond", "ReviewID": "R3NOBR9XJFGMQW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For the second time, I received the wrong item; instead of the 58mm package I received a digital camera charger: what's up with this mistake being repeated twice and I really wanted the 58mm package; what a disappointment!", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D9AXC76"}}
