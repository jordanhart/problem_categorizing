I bought these to supplement the battery that came with my Panasonic camera.  I believe that these batteries last longer than the brand-named battery and I am absolutely positive that the charger is better and faster.

Messick", "ReviewID": "R3EI6B7S6JG0HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These extra batteries are for my GX7 and they work great. The charger works well, and while I haven't used the car adapter, I like having the option.  I can't comment yet on how well it works though. The same or better life as the oem.

At the time of my purchase, there were not many reviews so I figured I would give them a chance. The two batteries and charger were almost half the price of one Panasonic battery for my GX7.Though the mAH rating is higher than the OEM battery, I haven't really noticed a difference. Additionally, having an extra charger on hand is a plus. So far, I would by them again.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works well so far", "Author": "donpablo", "ReviewID": "R3U576TQF4U9ZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Both batteries charged.

The other one seems to hold a charge, just not as long as the OEM bat.  So there ya go, something to consider regarding this product.Anyway, they're cheap --and because I need all the juice I can get right now with my GX7 I'm not going to return the purchase, just chucking the bad bat into the trash.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best choice!", "Author": "Andrzej", "ReviewID": "RIR8NSH6VH8UK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good product I recommend it for 100% for everyone interested.

These seem to work perfectly, to last about as long as the original, and the charger is also a great addition as it has a car adapter, unlike the charger that came with the camera.

When I got them they were each packaged nicely in their own separate boxes, along with a separate box for the charger.I went ahead and plugged them in because I wasn't sure how long they had been sitting since the last charge even though they said they came fully charged I just wanted to be sure. It didn't take long to charge to full battery since they came pretty much with a full charge.I used them on a new born shoot I did because I wanted to test out how long they would last.I was able to take about 250 pictures with them give or take some deleting and looking back through to make sure I got the shot I wanted. This battery lasted a couple hours with constant turning on and off of my camera.That's pretty good I guess, but the actual Lumix battery that came with my camera the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX7 I am able to take over 400 pictures with one battery so I guess its about half of what the lumix battery can do.All and all for the price, and the fact that you get two batteries, plus the charger that converts to a car charger, makes it nice to have the extra ones when my Lumix battery runs out of juice. I can charge it while I have these in my camera. I would recommend these if you just need some extra batteries like I did.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good in my GX7", "Author": "S.

I have not shot down an entire charge yet so can't comment on how much longer if any these will last than the stock Panasonic battery.  I can say that the product seems reliable and I think I will be carrying the Halcyon charger instead of the Panasonic, since the build quality looks good and it's dimensionally smaller than the Panny.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Doesn't hold charge in the cold", "Author": "Kelli K Burkinshaw", "ReviewID": "R3H70X3JRS95GY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I take longish kayak trips in SE Alaska (think cool and wet) and like to take lots of photos, videos and create timelapses too with my Panasonic GX7.  I was excited to see that these batteries were were rated for more mAH than the OEM batteries, so I bought a few of them.  On a recent four day paddle, I found that these batteries all lost their power after one night in ~30 degree F weather, whereas the OEMs I had both held their charges throughout the trip.  I'll be purchasing more OEMs...although these do work well in climate controlled settings - say longer video recordings inside the house. So it was not a total loss, just not the silver bullet I was hoping for on my longer kayak trips.
