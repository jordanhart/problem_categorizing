{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb point 'n shoot is just a notch below a DSLR", "Author": "Jerry Saperstein", "ReviewID": "RIC3BZK99723Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the past, I've owned or used several Panasonic Lumix models. All were good digital cameras. The FZ-50, however, is something very special.  The Leica approved lens design is, as always, superbly sharp. From a butte with a 50+ mile view, landscapes of wheat fields were crisp and highly detailed and the 10 megapixel images withstood enlargement well. Color fidelity is also excellent though a bit on the muted side: easy enough to quickly correct in any image editing program.  The new optical image stabilization (OIS) algorithm which compensates for both hand shaking and subject movement is absolutely brilliant and works incredibly well.  The ability to shoot at ISO values up to 1,600 goes hand in hand with the new OIS abilities. No one could resist testing a handheld digital camera in a dim environment at ISO 1600. Needless to say, the images are noisy. But at ISO 1600, what would you expect? Handheld photos shot at 1/20th of a second at ISO 1600 in a dim restaurant were filled with both detail and noise. Remarkably the color balance was very well-handled: the incadescent restaurant lights were recorded faithfully along with the neon and halogen lamplight streaming in through the blinds from outside. Very, very impressive.  Much of the noise could be ameliorated in Photoshop or similar programs with appropriate plug-ins. The high-speed capability is well worth the trade for noisy images. Purists may want noiseless images at ISO 1600, but it's unlikely they will ever get it. Practical photographers, on the other hand, will definitely appreciate the capability and undoubtedly will exploit it.  Ergonomically, the FZ-50 is practically a work of art. All of the frequently used controls are accessible with the right hand. The enlarged hand grip is just perfect for my large hands and the shutter release is perfectly positioned, something I am not able to say about most of the digital cameras I've used. The electronic viewfinder is sharp and is boosted for low-light focusing. (There is also an AF-assist lamp.) The flip-out LCD may be positioned for high and low angle shooting or reversed for self-portraits.  At about 1-1/2 pounds, the FZ-50 is a joy to carry for long periods.  The menu system is very accessible and quick and easy to adjust.  The few scene modes I tried worked well. Shooting pictures from a car moving at 60 miles per hour worked surprisingly well in the sports action mode.  Shutter lag is remarkably slight: the Panasonic Venus III engine lives up to its billing. Response is not up to the level of a Nikon or Canon DSLR, but it is certainly faster than any other midlevel digital camera I've used. Burst rate of about one frame per second are routinely attainable.  The FZ-50 will do RAW, but it is on the slow side. Either use an extremely fast SD card or avoid RAW where you need to be prepared for one exposure after another. JPEG files at full resolution (3,648 x 2,736 pixels) are quite good and will withstand, in my opinion, enlargement of about 4 - 5x.  I think SD card compatibility may be an issue with 4GB cards. I tried one and the camera refused to boot. A variety of 2GB cards worked without a problem.  The battery is rated for 360 shots between images. The test used by manufacturers uses one shot every 30 seconds, I believe. My experience with the battery didn't allow for more than 300 shots before the warning indicator started flashing. I don't know how many more shots I could have gotten, but I would definitely advise having a second battery for this camera.  I did not try the movie mode, so I can't comment on that.  Overall, the FZ-50 is more than satisfactory in every way. It is not a replacement for a Canon or Nikon DSLR, but is in many ways more satisfying to use. It is lighter than either a Canon or a Nikon; its 12x Leica approved designed lens covers 35 - to 425mm. Image quality is superb and the OIS is fantastic. I would highly recommend the FZ-50 as a travel camera or just for everyday use.Jerry", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Superb with Fantastic Ergonomics", "Author": "P.Broadnax", "ReviewID": "R249BJHFCSVOV9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perhaps you've heard: one of the most difficult targets for photography = birds-- super small **and** super frisky. Most texts urge you to buy a dSLR, with a VERY long AND fast zoom.  Such lenses are heavy, big, 4-figure expensive AND require stabilization. To outfit yourself accordingly, you're looking at a minimum 2 grand outlay (camera body, walk-around lens, fast super-zoom lens, tripod, etc)...........................On the other hand, this 10mp all-in-one camera STARTS with a built-in 12x zoom. This yields the 35mm equivalent of a 35mm to 420mm lens, WITH an aperture of f/2.8 to 3.7. In English: fast, and with serious reach. Yet, there's a delightful surprise: you can EASILY drop down to 5mp, getting in return a 17x OPTICAL zoom. Bird still too far away? Drop the camera's resolution down to 3mp--- now you've got a 21.4x OPTICAL zoom. This is NO software-based gimmick, folks, as the quality of the image remains incredible throughout. The camera simply hones in on the central image (i.e., the central 5mp or 3mp area), cropping out the excess sides, thereby effectively increasing the optical zoom with NO image deterioration. As I already have Panasonic's LT55 telephoto 1.7x converter lens (used with my now-old FZ7 camera), I can just screw that directly onto the FZ50 lens, for still more reach. And again, none of this is \"digital\", so we're still talking super optical quality throughout the reach. Keep in mind-- this is all **with** image stabilization! It's so very good / crisp/ detailed, that I now **keep** it at 3mp whenever I'm shooting birds, so I can enjoy that mind-blowing extra optical zoom.Now, if some of the technical jargon in the preceding paragraph spooks you, know this: I purchased my first digicam (FZ7) a few months ago. I knew nadda, photographically speaking. But I added \"PCPhoto Digital Zoom Camera Handbook\" to my cart, enjoyed the easy but super-informative read during a weekend, and was shooting up a storm in no time, actually KNOWING what the different options are all about. Later, when I started wondering about actual \"technique,\" a quick trip to my local bookstore introduced me to a UK monthly magazine, \"Digital Camera\" --- truly useful info in every issue, not to mention the included teach-me CD with videos.If you prefer to just point and shoot, there's a \"auto\" mode for you. If you like scene modes, you'll find plenty here from which to choose, including night scene, fireworks scene, and party scene.  There's a zoom ring, instead of a moving lens jutting in and out. If you prefer to sometimes indulge manual focus, you'll love the new focus ring on the lens. Nice touch: the system auto-magnifies the target as you rotate the focus ring, encouraging maximum sharpness.That's the thing about this ultra sweet package: nice touches abound, making for an marveloously smooth and easy user experience. There are two dial rings, which you manipulate with your third finger and thumb (as index finger sits in shutter release). Both dial rings are to the right of the camera, one in front and the other in the back. Ergonomically,  this means that your eye need never leave the electronic viewfinder (or LCD)  in order to tweak exposure. These can be customized, allowing one to no-think change aperture and exposure compensation on the fly, with a simple, quick twirl of a dial ring (the selections/result are visible on the EVF/LCD). A \"function\" button allows equal ease in tweaking white balance, flash, bracketing, ISO sensitivity and more. Read: no hunting thru the system menu!Want to add an external flash? No problem-- there's a hot shoe. Like to crop pics within the camera itself? Do it in \"playback\" mode-- it's your option as to whether to retain or trash the original. Want to save your tweaking settings as an \"option\"? Use one of the 3 personal customization slots available. Prefer an EVF? Got it. Want a move-it-around sharp LCD? Wish granted. Wanna zoom your pics during playback, to doublecheck for sharpness? Also dirt easy, via a max 8x zoom. Wear glasses? So what, there's a diopter adjustment dial next to the EVF. You can even get an optional shutter release cord.55mm filters, as well as the LT55 teleconverter for the FZ7, work fine here without a special converter-- just screw the add-on to the FZ50 lens itself. But it's an either-or proposition, i.e., can't use a circular polarizer with the teleconverter lens. Small loss, given the series of optional built-in optical zooms you can get from this beauty.Third party batteries work just fine. Just look for a CGR-S006A equivalent. (I got cheapie DynaMax-- works great.) The charger is ultra-convenient. Not quite the size of a deck of cards, it just plugs into an outlet -- no cords. I always have one battery in it at home, so switching is a no sweat/delay deal (pop in and out). Very healthy battery life also (more than 300 pics, despite keeping the system at \"10 minutes\")!One negative: while there is a burst mode, it's rather slow. That irked me, but everything else is so profoundly sweet, that I've opted to live with it. Just too much incredible goodness here for me to elevate this one item to deal-breaker status.One special note: if you just start shooting when you get the camera, you might be disappointed. The pics may appear softer than you anticipate. Go into the menu, select \"Picture Adjustment\", and tweak saturation, contrast, sharpness and noise reduction until you get a personally satisfying result. Worth the extra effort!Still not sure about coughing up your hard-earned dough for the FZ50? Yes, it's a little cheaper elsewhere, but check out Amazon's return page (Help >> Return Policy >> Product Specific Policies >> Camera & Photo) -- it confirms a very generous 30-day return policy, from date of receipt. My bet is that, like me, you'll quickly adopt this baby as your own, tossing the Amazon box long before that 30 day period expires. And, you'll never look back.-------------In the Boxcamera (duh!)32mb SD cardbatterybattery chargerUSB connection cableAV cableCD-ROMShoulder strap (nice!)lens caplens hood", "Date": "September 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Superior advanced digicam", "Author": "antaylor", "ReviewID": "R1EPVO6RMA5RKS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Panasonic camera so I am coming to this completely objectively. People seem to be divided into two groups regarding the FZ50 (and by extension, most of Panasonic's recent digicams) - those who find it's image quality impressive despite it's limitations and enjoy it's superiority in most other areas and those who feel the FZ50 should have been a lot more than it is, lacking the output to back up it's DSLR stylings and not being a revolutionary upgrade over the FZ30. I stand somewhere in the middle but leaning more towards the first view.The fact is, the FZ50 is a great bridge / mega zoom all-in-one digicam. The huge 12x focal range really is liberating and I just could not go back to a measly 3x zoom ever again. The superior quality of the Leica lens, which really is the main selling point is not to be underestimated - it's very sharp, producing next to no chromatic aberrations with truly effective stabilisation and I think is far superior to the lens of current competition. As everyone points out, to get this quality of (stabilised) lens over such a huge focal range for a DSLR would usually require more than one bulky lens and would probably cost well over a $1000, so you can't really find anything to grumble about here.I absolutely love the manual zoom and focus, which means you can fine tune to a degree that you just couldn't with a mechanical zoom - it's also silent and saves valuable battery power. I've found colour representation in the photos to be realistic although I must say that on every digital camera I've used, photos have never appeared quite how my eyes saw the original scene colour wise. I've found auto white balance to do a good job in most situations so far and this can also be fine tuned when in manual mode. The flash output can also be set to varying degrees, which is useful when you want to retain a more natural look in dimly lit conditions. The ergonomics as everyone points out are also great, the FZ50 feels comfortable and your hand position will feel natural around it.The flexibility of the twist out and swivel LCD screen is also not to be underestimated, allowing more versatile shooting angles than a fixed screen would give you. I really wish the screen could have been bigger though - I'm sure Panasonic could have extended it to 2.5\" as there is a border around the screen which could have possibly been used up with extra pixels. However, the screen is great. At 207K pixels, everything is nice and sharp and there is no ghosting unless in very dim light. I am a little confused though as even though the EVF has a higher resolution than the LCD screen at 235K pixels, it is very noticeably less detailed in both colour and sharpness - can anybody enlighten me by leaving a comment?And so we come to image quality - the real bone of contention between the two camps. I have to say that I agree with a lot of those who complain about Panasonic's decision to up the pixel count from the FZ30 to 10mp whilst still using the same sized sensor, which is a fraction of the size of a DSLR. The (now infamous) Venus 3 engine covers the noise well but as others will point out, at the cost of smudging out fine detail. Unfortunately, when Panasonic in their FZ50 press release said that high ISO noise levels were much improved over the FZ30, they didn't quite mean they had made a breakthrough with sensor technology, they simply meant they had developed a better way to hide the noise!Having said that, my photos have really impressed me with great clarity and colour and the main digicam review sites have pointed out that the image quality is above average in this anyway superior class of consumer digicam, and you can see this from their test shots. Also, if you go onto some of the Panasonic forums such as at dpreview you'll find some great examples of what can be achieved with the FZ50 and I'm sure you'll be really impressed. And at low ISO 100, some comparison tests show the FZ50 to give lower end DSLR's like the XT a good run for their money! But you do have to ask what is the point of putting in 10 megapixels if you have to print and view at sizes that a lower megapixel count would give you because when viewed at 100%, the effects of the heavy noise reduction can look pretty ugly. I would have much preferred a 6mp FZ50 if that would have resulted in less noise for the Venus 3 to work with. If I'm right in saying that a larger sensor would then result in a smaller focal range then Panasonic have probably tried to get the best from all angles and successfully so - however, Fuji have shown that great strides in sensor technology can be achieved.To conclude, the FZ50 is a great advanced digicam and really impresses in all areas. It's a lot of fun to use because it's so comfortable and makes such a wide range of shots possible not to mention being extremely responsive and quick. The effects of the heavy noise reduction will only be an issue if you plan on viewing and printing large and using the high ISO's but otherwise image quality is great. For the advanced consumer who wants the best there is before the expense and bulk of a DSLR, then the FZ50 is the one to choose.", "Date": "October 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera, features, and more", "Author": "Joseph Caparco", "ReviewID": "R3BB0ZXN34YPQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera seems to be quite misunderstood. I have read review after review, and most complaints deal with the \"noise\" of the camera. There is in fact an issue with noise if you plan on shooting above ISO 400. But thinking about this, anything above ISO 400 would prduce some noise in most cameras. Even my digital SLR has noise when I go above ISO 400. If you plan on shooting outdoors, this camera has done well. Indoor shots using the flash are great. No red eye.ISO ratings came about from film cameras. They set the speed of the film. Even in a film camera, as you increase the ISO, you increase the grain of the film. I do not see a big problem with noise at 100 and 200. And for me, I do most shots outside, so it is fine. I think sometimes people are looking for a \"Perfect\" digital camera, and as far as I know - there is not one. But for the money, I would take on my Canon EOS 30D any day with this camera, and I would be pleased.This camera has wonderful features, a very crisp lens, and an excellent zoom range. When you set the camera to use 3Megs, the zoom range is incredible ! - I get better distant shots with this camera, than I do with my Canon 30D and a 300m lens.If you are looking for a compact digital camera that will offer you great shots, this is well worth the money. I have owned 3 Digital SLR's that cost in the $[...], and I still choose this camera.I have some test shots up on my web site if you wish to take a look. You will be amazed. (You can also post your test shots there as well). I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a reliable camera that will give great photos - both for the experienced user and the novice. Very well built, solid feel, and many features.Just an added note. I have owned this camera for two months now, taken over 2000 shots with it, and it has NEVER let me down.

I am a serious enthusiast photographer since 2001. The FZ50 is a handsome and light digital camera with wonderful features that work for me, such as the moving LCD screen. The screen turns all around allowing you to take yourself a picture. But the beauty of this is in some special pictures, such as putting the camera at ground level and shoot from there or lifting your camera over a crowd and still be able to frame your shot well. The full Manual Mode works so great that I might abandone the automatic all together. Pictures in the DMC-FZ50 were coming out overexposed in the automatic mode; I have solved this by shooting at S priority. One more thing: No review talks about it, not even the Panasonic official description of this camera, but the DMC-FZ50 has a very decent macro. I have been taking close up pictures my cats and of the flowers in my garden and they came out really good. For a simple person like me, 10 megapixels help me when I need to crop a third of a picture in my computer and still retain printing quality.  Actually, the camera lens are excellent and I have not experienced any \"noise.\" The viewfinder is very clear. Besides its great Zoom, this camera also takes EXCELLENT indoor pictures, better so if you use a tripod. The crude reality tough is that, although it is very easy to learn and operate, this camera is no instamatick. So you need to know some photography to really enjoy all its features and get back what you paid for. The bottom line that works for me is: I'm small, fragile and not really rich, I just cannot see myself carrying  expensive SLR digital cameras with heavy and costly interchangeable lens. And, frankly, unless you want to make it into the photography business, you will not need more than this camera to take excellent pictures. In fact, this is the type of camera that might take you into the next step of your picture taking experience because it is very rewarding; so you will be taking good pictures like crazy.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Much Ado About Nothing (Noise Levels)", "Author": "J. B. Quattlebaum", "ReviewID": "R3LBKUJQ9DKRI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you read the various reviews of the DMC-FZ50 on the 'Net, you will see many remarks about the high noise level of the Panasonic sensor at high ISO settings.  The same reviewers will post sample photographs for your perusal -- pay close attention to them.  First, on many of them the noise is not objectionable at all.  Second, they are JPEGs produced by the Venus III engine.  Yet, this superlative camera can produce RAW images.  With the SilkyPix software included with the camera kit, you can bypass the Venus III noise reduction (RAW images do not use the camera's noise reduction circuitry).  The SilkyPix noise reduction software (or that available in Adobe RAW Capture) is superior to the Venus III, and will produce final images that equal those produced by the Canon Rebel XTi or the Nikon D80.With the debate over noise levels now moot, I challenge anyone to find a comparable camera with similar features at ANY price that can best the DMC-FZ50.", "Date": "December 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Super little camera.", "Author": "Douglas Henderson", "ReviewID": "RVNLN35ULW365", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this FZ50 camera from Amazon last week at a good bargin price--477.00.  And added some 1GB memory cards and an extra battery.  All arrived intact. I've had a Panasonic FZ10 for a few years and it still works perfectly.  The FZ series has moved on to the FZ20 and the FZ30--and by the time I got around to thinking of buying a new model, the FZ50 came alone.  Recent price made me jump, partly for concern that the model could be discontinued for the next new thing.Having now seen some 90 (so far) digital image from a FZ50 for myself, the noise issue simply isn't there for images shot during daylight at lower ASA sensitivities (100, maybe 200).  The little CCD sensor can't be expected to do well at higher ASA settings, but I was surprised at how nice all the test shots turned out. Detail in images shot at 100 ASA is simply grand.  The higher telephoto shots show sharp, unimagined detail, without apparent chromatic problems (red, blue, etc. fringing around objects near edges of an image).  This improvement over the FZ10, I think, is a result of the Venus III processor, rather than the lens, but all the same the images are very clean and sharp from edge to edge at wide and moderate aperature settings used so far (F3.5 to F5.6).The camera is rich with features, but the best in my opinion is the Focus/Exposure lock botton.  The Focus/Exposure lock has three settings in the menu:1) Focus lock2) Exposure lock3) Both focus and exposure lock togetherSince the auto focus and the manual focus work so well, I selected exposure lock.  Because the view finder is a digital image that reflects the exposure one is about to make (with shutter half-compressed), the ability to detect whether the image might be over or under-exposed makes the exposure lock very useful.  One only has to find a slightly dimmer or brighter image on which to lock exposure and return to the desired image with a modified exposure setting very quickly. The locked exposure is released when you press the button again. Wonderful feature.This is not the camera to get if you want to reproduce large, smooth prints, though smaller prints up to 11x14 inches ought to look pretty nice.  Instead, this camera is a unique, all-in-one-piece, wide to telephoto tool able to capture subjects near and far in wonderful detail.  Being an illustrator, this camera is perfect for capturing the nut and bolt resources for future work--be it rabbits, birds, people, landscapes, etc.  The Image Stabilization (set in menu to work only when pressing shutter) works very well and greatly helps the very good lens get the best shot--my opinion, anyway, after seeing the first test results.  I could clearly read our town's name on a water tower some 3 miles away and was able to take some surprisingly sharp hand-held photos of the moon at full telephoto.Bought this FZ50 for my wife--another one of those Homer bowling ball gift purchases.", "Date": "December 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Panasonic FZ50 for outdoor soccer", "Author": "Jeffrey Whitman", "ReviewID": "RW66FVM9CT79V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Panasonic FZ50 primarily to take pictures of my daughter's soccer games (she's 10). The more I get to know the camera, the more I like it. It's the best camera for me, short of purchasing an SLR and several lenses.Since one of the biggest strengths is the Leica lens, I've learned that zooming in to frame the shot (versus taking a wide-angle picture and cropping on the computer later) provides the most crisp results. The pictures I get in full daylight are quite remarkable, especially when printed at 4x6.Further, I really enjoy the easy access to ISO sensitivity. I start out at ISO 100, and if it gets cloudy or dark I can quickly adjust to ISO 200 or 400 (or higher) and still get the \"stop action\" pictures. At higher ISO and 4\"x6\" prints, the increased noise is not an issue. I think it's flattering that people are comparing the \"noise\" of the FZ50 to that of DLSR's (which, of course, have less noise at high ISO's).I am now exploring the focus (and auto exposure) lock functionality, which really speed up taking a photo. When the action dictates, I can lock in and then fire shots so quickly that I think I am using an SLR.Another usability feature I really like is the manual zoom.

I ocassionally changed to 5 mp's for less important shots (things I know will only go into our newsletter).  The color on the 5 mp shots wasn't as good, but adequate for it's purpose.The camera is usually very fast in terms of lag between pushing the button and the shutter actually firing -- there were several ocassions when there was a significant lag.  And sometimes it takes it's time focusing.  I was impressed, however, that the camera can focus practically in the dark.The Lumix is not as good as my Cannon Elan at capturing moving subjects -- even if they're not moving very fast.I bought the Sunpak 383 Auto Flash (a recommended accessory) with the camera.  It's not a bad flash, but not adequate for my needs.  At times with the pageant I have to photograph quickly and repeatedly.  The flash could not keep up with me.  It takes a long time to recycle.

I very rarely photograph sports or fast-moving subjects, so the cumulative lag times aren't much of a factor for me. Photographs aren't entirely made by the camera.

For shots outside this range - just how bad is the image quality?For you film buffs, think of the FZ50 as a budget 35mm film camera loaded with 100iso store brand film.  All you would ever need for casual use, and with careful lighting and composition, capable of award winning photos.  In a pitch you can push this 100iso film 1, 2, 3, 4, or even 5 stops (200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200).  Push it one stop and you can barely see the difference.  Push it 2 or 3 and you can start to see the increase in \"grain\" and decrease in dynamic range. Push it 4 or 5 and you have some great surveillance photo's but they look the part and are not going to win any awards.Given the 1/1.8 size image sensor in the FZ50 is about 5% of the size of a full frame 35mm sensor you would never expect images as good as the FZ50 produces even at its base 100iso.  The professionals have a lot to say about noise and image quality, but take a look at their sample photos (even print them up to 8x10)  and most folks would be very happy with the results.So take a look for yourself before some of the reviews scare you!", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera - Not a DSLR but a Very close relative", "Author": "N.

As old as my Fuji is, it still beats my Panny in burst mode by a factor of two (mainly due to file size) and it has a closer macro focusing range also, 1cm with Fuji vs 5cm with Panny. That being said the FZ50 blows the Fuji out the water in all other areas.With the FZ50, you cannot zoom in macro mode, but that's a small price to pay to have SLR type zoom ability, the motorized zoom can do a number on the camera's battery, so I give a big thumbs up to Panasonic on this. I haven't had any noise problems (because I've been staying at the 400 and sub ISO range) The form factor is the best I've had, the controls are in the right place and sensibly spaced ... like a PlayStation controller . Picture quality is awesome ... the zoom is awesome, with a friendly menu system. Focusing is fast and the lag time is the best I've had with a non DSLR camera, but I'm not reaping its full potential since I have a slow SD in the camera. I need to get a SanDisk, Extreme III Secure Digital card (one of the fastest card out there). This camera has a quality feel to it which is important to me.The camera way exceeds my expection in all areas. The only negative I have to say about it is the noise reduction ... it works too good. When an image is zoomed in at 100% you can see notice a little loss of detail due to the powerful noise reduction. Shooting in raw mode will nullify all the in camera processing, but your obviously going to have to be able afford files that's 5-6 times the size on your card.  This camera is identical to the Leica V-LUX 1 digital camera in every way except for the image processing parameters.I was torn between a DSLR and this, because we use a Canon DSLR at the job very often, but all things considered, I'll recommend this Digital cam as a great everyday camera my image comes out just as good or even better than our office Canon, besides, the extra few % of flexibility/improvement from a DSLR and lenses isn't worth the expense hassle or fatigue for me.

The Leica 35-420mm (35mm equivalent) lens is amazing, the colors are vibrant and the camera is a hugh improvement over our older Panasonic FZ-10 camera.  The pictures tend to be a little noisy at low light and high ISO but still very usable.  I normally shoot Nikon D200, but my spouse, because of vision problems, prefers the EVF of the FZ-50.  She lets me use it occasionally and I was able to take a tight crop on a 10MP image I shot, blow it up to 16\"x 20\" and earn a merit in a professional print competition.  So overall we are very pleased with the FZ-50.  I rated it four stars because of a few nits:1. The battery door closure is a little too easy to open, and doesn't feel secure2. The on-off switch is located so that when the camera is put in a camera bag it tends to rub and switch on.3.  The dedicated TTL flashes from Panasonic are too expensive.  The Olympus FL36 and FL50 seem to be the same as the Panasonic FL360 and FL500 respectively and the Olympus flashes are much lower cost.  We have the Olympus FL36 and it works very well with the FZ-50.Considering the price of the camera, this is a lot of capability for the money.

This is simply not true. The Spot AF area is permanently placed dead center in the viewfinder and cannot be moved. A call to Tech Support merely got me a word-for-word repeat of what the book says, along with an admission that the book appears to be wrong, and emails to Panasonic go unanswered (I had been prewarned by a highly reputable local pro camera shop that the reason they won't carry Pansonic items is because of the horrible Customer Service. I guess they were right).As far as the over-agressive Noise Reduction (resulting in softer images than neccessary) others have mentioned in reviews around the internet, this only affects jpeg images. You can avoid this by shooting in RAW mode instead of jpeg, and do your own Noise Reduction in Photoshop with a NeatImage or Noise Ninja plug-in. IMO, anybody serious enough about their photography to buy a $500 camera with a Leica lens shouldn't be shooting jpegs anyway.RAW gives you ALL of the data that the sensor picks up, allowing you to make an extremely wide range of adjustments in post processing without degrading the image quality, but jpegs process in-camera, permanently throw away all of that valuable extra data, and apply heavy sharpening. Sharpening should basically be the last thing done to a photo before printing, as any adjustments, processing or resizing done after sharpening often looks like garbage.Overall, I'm still thrilled with the FZ50; it has earned its place among my Canon DSLRs. If you don't need movable Spot AF, and you can take the time and effort to shoot in RAW, this is a superb camera and well worth the price!", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best camera I've ever owned", "Author": "Patricia Gould", "ReviewID": "R3CRNZ8T7NWBAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was contemplating a DSLR but didn't really want to lay out $1500+ and carry around an extra lens for telefoto. I've been shooting with an SLR for 35 years, even used to have my own dark room so I expect quality in my photos. I need the camera for travel (landscapes and animals) and for shooting my art work for jury entries and publication. The latter need to be high quality.My first digital was an Olympus UZ 730, great camera with 38-380 mm, very lightweight, nice photos except that it was only 3MP. It is very hard to find anything above 8MP with a long zoom. I read the reviews about this Panasonic and I know I made the right choice.I've only had it since November but I already have taken it on a camping/hiking excursion and re-shot some of my artwork.The best was on Jan 2 when the first full moon of 2007 rose over the very reddish Sandia mountains here in Albuquerque. I ran out in the snow and zoomed my lens out to its furthest. The shot is gorgeous! I wasn't so sure about the ability to keep steady but the IS gave me a crystal clear shot. That really convinced me.The menus and dials are very easy to navigate. I like that the zoom is manual and not motorized as was my Olympus. You get more control over it. The battery isn't being used either. I still prefer to use the view finder but the LCD is very nice and large and the ability to swivel is great.I have a friend who spent close to $5000 on one of the NIkons and its so cumbersome she doesn't want to carry it around. I admit, the Panasonic is heavier than I would ideally like but there's no way to get that much zoom and MP in a smaller body.I generally like to manually adjust my settings but I tried the \"snow\" setting last week after we had the record breaking 2 feet of snow and the color and light were just right and it was still early in the morning.I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants more than point and shoot but why spend thousands on a DSLR when this one does it just as well. With my Olympus 3MP camera, I was able to enlarge the high res shots to 11 X 14 so with this Panasonic, I'll feel very comfortable enlarging even more and submitting for publishing.Also, I almost got conned into buying from a \"cheap\" web site but it's classic bait & switch. The low price they quote doesn't include a battery and charger and they want $150 for those. So glad I bought from Amazon.

Izzi", "ReviewID": "R2RWI7963I3PII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's the Leatherman Super Tool of the digital photography world! Built like a tank and feels so good in your hands. I bought this macho camera three months ago and I love it more and more as I am getting to know it better. This is my sixth digital camera (had had an old Sony FD, little Canons A60, A70, and A85, as well as a lovely Olympus C-2100UZ which the FZ-50 will replace). Short of going DSLR and investing a car's price on lenses, external flashes and other gadgets, this is as far as you can get, and it is not bad at all. The talk about noise is exaggerated and this baby manages to deliver a virtually noise free image at ISO-400. Let's face it folks, that's more than you need in real life. I shot 35mm for donkeys of years and very rarely did I exceed ISO-200. The lens is a killer Leica 35-420mm 35mm equiv. at a whooping fast f/3.7 aperture at the far end of the super zoom. It is even faster (f/2.8) if you zoom out. And it is tack sharp! And it has an optical image stabilization that really works! Leica is producing a copy of this camera that is marketed for $900 street price, which is a carbon copy save for the red dot and a slightly modified \"Leica looks\" algorithm, and is slower in every operation as a result. I think this is the baby to go for, so don't hesitate; you will get more value for your money than you can imagine.This camera is for you if:1.) You want a 35-420mm 2.8 lens, made by Leica + Image Stabilization + 10 MegaPixels + Live preview -all for less than $4502.) If you are an amateur stepping up from a compact, who wants to experience SLR-like capability at a reasonable entry price.This camera is not for you if:1.) You shoot most of your pictures at ISO 1600 or IS 32002.) You make a living shooting multi-burst sport action with sudden erratic motion, like football or soccer.Disadvantages of a DSLR when compared to a super-zoom, such as the FZ50:1. Money: You will spend more, much more!A. Initial price of the body alone (let a lone a kit price) is substantially higher than that of a super-zoom.B. The potential for consequent spending: with a DSLR the spending hardly ends with the initial purchase, many expensive subsequent purchases will surely follow: lenses, accessories, external flashes etc. and the prices of these usually exceed what you pay for the camera body.2. Dust on the sensor: the potential of dust forming on the sensor is a certainty due to changing lenses with a DSLR. Cleaning is tedious, expensive, and dangerous for it packs the risk of damaging the sensor and other internal parts of the camera unless you are very familiar with the process. You need to buy extra equipment (dust scope, vacuum, special cleaners) and all that means extra money and extra skills are required. The built in dust cleaning ultrasonic mechanism in top-dollar DSLRs doesn't always get rid of foreign particles, and they never get rid of stains (resulting say from humidity or water spray). A super-zoom is hermetically sealed and this headache is nonexistent.3. The mechanical shutter: All DSLRs have one, and that is disadvantageous in three ways:A. Limited life, after a certain number of exposures it needs to be replaced, a very expensive undertaking, while the super-zoom has unlimited life with its electronic shutter.B. Potential for breaking down / jams, the rule of the thumb with moving mechanical parts.C. Mirror slap and shutter judder causes vibration that will work against camera-based or lenses-based vibration reduction (VR)  and image stabilization (IS) systems (if any) reducing its effectiveness. In super-zooms, vibration due to electronic shutter firing is virtually none.4. No live preview: Except for top-dollar latest models, the greatest majority of DSLRs doesn't have it. It is standard on the super-zooms (actually it is the only viewing there is, through the EVF).5. Weight, size and portability: DSLR are generally heavier and bulkier than super-zooms, and the extra lenses and gear renders them a hassle to haul about or travel with.

The macro function only works at full wide angle and often you have to be physically so close that a small subject is shadowed by the lens or lens barrel.

This works great on slightly blotchy intense blue skies here on Cape Cod. Buy a 3rd party high capacity battery if you plan to do much flash shooting. Camera is largish due to fixed lens barrel.

Many of my pictures people say are worth being in a magazine.  As I said before, however,  LOW LIGHT IS NOT GREAT.  The sensor is just not good enough.  I still recommend bumping up to a Canon/Nikon if possible.  However,my dad, the photo nut (who has a canon and Nikon) made a comment about buying one of these since my pictures were so good.  The quality of the camera is still excellent.  Sometimes I hear what sounds like a little motor and that concerns me.  The batteries are just now starting to fade.  Still a great camera.  Has been through a lot and is holding up very well.Original Comment from Aug 2007:My personal photographic experience:  Almost 0 knowledge on f-stops, etc...but lots of push and shoot experience, dad is a SLR photo nut.  I am a biologist, so wanted a camera to take into the field.1.  Overall, I rate my camera 8.5/10.  I have had it since just after it came out.  The pictures are excellent, BUT, for those of us who shoot in shady areas (BIRDERS), THE CAMERA HAS BIG PROBLEMS WITH LOW LIGHT LEVELS.  So far, I have not been able to produce any excellent bird photos that I would say are magazine quality.  If you can afford it, make the jump to Canon/Nikon.  However, I do take my camera everywhere and I have lots of great pictures now.  I took a lot of Crane pics at Bosque del Apache and got some excellent shots, but at twilight, when it really matters, the pictures were EXTREMELY grainy.1A.  Birding:  I use the camera primarily to help me id birds I see.  It is great for that, even in low light, but not twilight low light.  It is fast, focuses well, and zooms in nicely.2.  Lots of good things about this camera too.  It would be great for anyone not worried about low-light.  The speed setting is fantastic.  When we were driving 80 down a highway, I took a picture of an oncoming truck from a long distance, and was able to zoom in CLEARLY on the driver.3.  The manual focus ring is great!!  Since I am focusing through branches, I can tell the camera exactly what to focus on.  This is important.  Despite this great feature, I still have trouble with the focus sometimes, it seems clear through the viewfinder, but doesn't turn out.4.  BEST OF ALL:  the camera buttons are so intutitive, that after a little practice, you don't need to look at them.  They are easy to use as you are looking through the viewfinder.  I love this!  (everything except the dial on top I mean).5.  The zoom does live up to its reputation.  This is superhandy for sneaky shots of relatives or deer.  I have gotten some great deer pictures.Addendum 03/17/08I have now had this camera about 2 years.  My review stands as presented.  One macro shot I took was called \"magazine quality\" by a friend.  I have learned that the burst mode is not as fast  as my dad's Nikon.  I have also learned that despite the advertised speed, the camera has a noticeable delay that better brands don't.  I would still recommend going up to a Canon/Nikon if you can afford it.  If not, this is a great camera.When out birding a few weeks ago,  I was on a trail in lots of sun looking through dense trees at an owl.  I was able to clearly focus on the owl.  My friend who has a $10,000 lens and Canon, did not get a better shot than I did.  I was so happy!  We got the same quality shot.The zoom on this camera is outstanding!

So far I've been able to find very few things I would change about it... one thing is that the warm/cool color options on the P/SP/AP setting aren't great (warm is too orange and sunset-y, cool is a little too blue) and the second thing is that to me, the lens cap sits just a little too close to the lens, which can mean scratches on the lens if the cap is put on too quickly or a little carelessly. (I guess if you're careful this shouldn't be a problem.) However, the color in the Scene settings is great and natural, and I wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend this camera. The pictures are SHARP and high quality, even when printed letter size. I feel like they would be great much  bigger, poster size....but who can afford it?!? The automatic ISO setting  works well. I hate using a flash because it can destroy the shadows, but the ISO allows me to get an accurate shot even in dim lighting, and without a noticeable loss in picture quality. The Scene settings are great and take away a lot of the guess work of trying to figure out details (\"If I set a faster shutter speed how do I need to compensate for light?\") I love the Scenery setting that keeps even distant photos sharp out to the very edges. And the 9-point focus that allows you to focus on several subjects instead of one center figure (think, a group portrait.) And the jitter-cutter-downer (sorry, I know that there IS a technical way of saying that) really cuts down on hand shake. The camera has a very fast start up time which makes things like taking pictures from a moving car much easier(don't worry, I'm not the driver). I see something I want to take, turn it on, and by the time I raise it to my eye it's ready to go. Another thing-don't let the batteries turn you off to this camera. They last a long time, charge relatively quickly-and they're not as expensive as you think. If you Google the exact name of the battery you need, you can find generic brands that work just as well, are designed specifically for this camera, and are really, really cheap. One more thing before I go-not only does this camera take great photos, it also cleans up in the looks/feel department. It's not a toy-sized point and shoot that fits great into a purse or pocket, so if that's a consideration for you you may want to look at something else, but it fits well in my hand, has a sturdy grip, and the right weight, unlike a smaller camera. It feels more \"professional\" too-I mean, how cool are zoom/focus rings on the barrel as opposed to a little ring around the shutter button? (By the way, the zoom is great. I don't shoot higher than 12x most of the time, but it can go up to 48x which, if nothing else, sounds impressive. Another feature I like that's not actually necessary but a perk anyway is the \"Flip Animation\" mode. This allows you to move an object-take a picture-move the object-take a picture...and then string them together so it looks like its moving independently. That can get old pretty quickly :) but if you have kids you trust to use this camera, I expect they're going to have a good time with it....If you buy this camera, order it through Amazon. You can get it a little cheaper elsewhere, but the hassle isn't worth it. I tried to order through another site, and ended up talking to a sales rep four or five times and fending off sales pitches...and then the camera went out of stock! I ended up buying it from Amazon, and I can tell you from experience that they have the best service all around.Also, if you have other photo-editing software, KEEP IT until you check out the packaged stuff. It's ok, but not great, and I was much more impressed with the program that came with my Canon S2.Finally, things you need for this camera:-At least one spare battery (I have two)-A memory card with at least 1GB of space (my 1GB card holds about 120 pictures taken at 10MPs, but more with less pixels.)The packaged card holds around 2. Total.-A lens cleaner set (these run around [...])-A camera bag. NOT, repeat NOT one that all but says \"Camera Bag Steal Me\" on the side. (So not the specific Lumix bag, which is tiny anyway).

Read on if you are considering purchasing this camera, or jump straight to the Conclusions, Pros and Cons sections at the bottom of this review....Although I've been a film SLR photo-enthusiast since my mid-teens, starting with a Canon AE1 some 25 years ago, I've taken to digital photography given the improvements in recent years. Still a sucker for classic styling, I initially took to the look of the Leica V-Lux1, only to soon find out that the Panasonic Lumix FZ50 is more-or-less a rebranded Leica that can be had for $300 less! Being practical minded, I went with the Panasonic.In addition to its classic design, the Lumix FZ50 is an outstanding camera in most respects, from the really exceptional Leica lens, to the solid, professional build quality, the well laid out controls, and the ergonomic user interface. This camera puts the photographer in control, allowing a range of options from fully automatic to fully manual. The 12X optical zoom (or 20X optical zoom if you choose to shoot in 3MP) is able to produce exceptionally sharp and detailed pictures with vibrant colors, even at low light. The autofocus and image stabilizer are just outstanding.Now, I wont lie to you and say that this camera replaces a DSLR. It doesn't. My wife has a Canon Rebel XTi DSLR which can, if you look closely enough, produce more detailed pictures than the Lumix FZ50. BUT you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference in image quality in a computer screen or an 8\" x 10\" print - unless you view the pictures in actual size. Besides, the colors producted by the Panasonic are actually slighly more vibrant than those from the Canon.Now I'll get straight to the flaw that is oft repeated in many an editorial review of the Lumix FZ50. These reviews talk about the image noise that becomes apparent when you shoot in low light or in ISO400 and above. To see the effect, check out the \"DCRP\" review of the Lumix FZ50 at dcresource_dot_com. In particular, compare the night scene pictures of the San Francisco waterfront at various ISO levels and compare those pictures with the pictures in the similar DCRP review of the Canon Rebel XTi. You will see that the Rebel XTi does a much better job in noise-reduction at higher ISO levels than the Lumix FZ50.Now the real problem is not the noise per se, but the noise reduction artefacts produced by the Venus III engine in the camera.  The internal software (i.e., firmware) is overly aggressive in noise reduction. It seems to employ a \"water coloring\" approach to noise reduction, which produces progressively softer images as the ISO gets higher. (Think of it as as a software paintbrush that gets thicker as the ISO gets higher). At ISO 100 and 200, the NR leaves the images relatively sharp. At ISO 400 and higher the NR leaves the images considerably softer and causes details to be lost.Some editorial reviewers say that Panasonic crammed in too many pixels in the small CCD and that 10.1 MP is overkill. But I beg to differ! The lens and CCD combination in this camera is oustanding and are NOT the problem. Read on.All digital cameras produce a degree of image noise. If you look at any RAW image you will see a degree of noise, even those from high-end DSLRs. It's conversion from RAW to the JPEG image that the Venus III engine does a rather shabby job.HOW TO GET BEST QUALITY RESULTS:Now that we've seen the problem, the solution is rather trivial. There are two basic options. The easy way is to correct the jpeg images produced by the Venus III engine. The best way is to override the Venus III processor altogether by post-processing the RAW images.1. THE EASY WAYFirst, the main rule of thumb, NEVER shoot any of your serious pictures in anything higher than ISO200.(Note that fully automatic mode tends to use higher ISO's in low light. Use the program \"P\" mode instead and leave the ISO at 100).Download the demo version NeatImage as well as the \"noise profile\" file for the Panasonic FZ50 from NeatImage_dot_com. The demo version is free and works really well. After you copy your pictures from your camera to a folder on your PC, run NeatImage, load the appropriate profile file and process your pictures.NeatImage saves the files with a _filtered.jpg  extension. The great thing is NeatImage allows you to batch process multiple files in a folder.2. THE BEST WAYFor even better results, shoot all your \"boutique\" pictures in RAW and use the supplied SilkyPix software to convert the pctures from RAW to JPEG. SilkyPix basically replaces the Venus III engine's firmware, to enable you to do the conversion from RAW to JPEG externally on your PC.(The SilkyPix manual, and a free software update, are available at their website. You need to install SilkyPix from the supplied CD first, which provides a link to the website from the Help menu).Run SilkyPix and open the *.RAW file you want to convert. You need to click the NR button on the left panel which brings up the Noise reduction options. I left the NR settings at their default(s). You can play with NR as well as the other settings, \"Exp\", \"WB\", \"Sharp\", \"Tone\" and \"Color\", if you like but the defaults work just fine. Then click Developments(D) menu, select Developments(S) and  save the output to a jpeg file.Then run NeatImage on the file developed from SilkyPix, using the appropriate noise profile file for the Lumix FZ50.Do this and you will see outstanding pictures. It will be very hard to now tell the difference between picture quality of the Lumix FZ50 and a DSLR like the Canon Rebel XTi when you shoot in RAW and process with SilkyPix and NeatImage.CONCLUSION:While the Lumix FZ50 is not a true DSLR replacement, it CAN replace a DSLR in many occasions, given the 12X optical zoom (35mm equilvalent: 35mm - 420mm). However, you must shoot in RAW and post process for best results.PROS:- Professional, heavy build quality and feel- Exceptional Leica lens- Manual focus and zoom rings let you overide Auto- sharp auto focus, even at low light- accurate vibrant colors- image stabilizer- program shift (\"partial manual\" mode)- spot metering- 12x optical (10.1 MP)- 21x optical (3 MP)- Decent video output- Supports 2GB SD cards- Support 4GB SD HC cards!- Flash hot shoeCONS:- Blotchy noise reduction at low light or ISO 400 and higher. (Read the review on how to avoid this problem.)- Small LCD (2\").- Built-in flash tends to overexpose slightly.

It is the only camera that I have every had that could do that.", "Date": "August 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nothing better on the market in its category", "Author": "Saska Albright", "ReviewID": "R1S8S9ZUC0VLWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I began my digital photography hobby with a Lumix DMC-FZ1, which had similar glass to the FZ-50. I told myself if I was still shooting in three years I'd buy a \"real\" camera, and when the time came, I shopped the Nikons and the Canons first.However, I had grown used to the best asset of the FZ series: that phenomenal 12x optical Leica lens. I shot the full range of the lens, verified by analyzing tens of thousands of photos from the previous three years. I simply couldn't get the versatility out of a DSLR with add-on lenses unless I spent four or five times my budget.I've owned the camera for 6 months now, and I still feel it was the best investment for me and the kind of photography I do. More serious photographers may want the granular control of being able to switch lenses, but if you're on the fence - or if you want just one piece of equipment to take phenomenal pictures while traveling - there is nothing else that compares in the realm of SLR-like high-end digital \"point and shoot\" cameras.The Pros:12x optical zoom in a variable-aperture Leica lens. Its light retention through the full range is outstanding, and the inclusion of image stabilization makes it possible to really use the far end of the zoom.RAW mode (particularly in concert with Adobe Lightroom, although the included Silkypix software is passable) allows you to recover elements you'd lose in a JPEG when you're shooting in less than ideal conditions.Easy to navigate menus and the ability to save your favorite manual settings as scene modes to save time on the fly.High-resolution widescreen-format video is on par with low-end digital video cameras, although you must have a very fast high-capacity SD card to take advantage of this mode.Time-to-shoot from off position is dramatically improved over previous models in the series, and burst mode is very good when capturing JPEG images.Full manual control gives you almost all the functionality of a high-end DSLR; Scene modes are relatively well-designed and usable, although the absence of a macro mode (replaced with a macro auto-focus option) will irk some shooters.Good management of color and light in low-light settings (with expected noise) make it possible to use this camera for snapshots as well as more serious endeavors.Support for hotshoe flash attachments allows me to do strobist work with my Nikon- and Canon-DSLR aficionado buddies (but be careful to buy a flash designed for DSLRs). I shoot with a Sunpak Super 383 and wireless Cactus flash transmitter/receiver units.Adjustable flip/twist viewfinder makes it possible to get this big camera into unlikely places and still get exactly the shot I want.The Cons:Since it was built before the advent of 4GB high-capacity SD cards, it only supports 2GB cards. A firmware update could fix this, but none has been forthcoming from Panasonic. This is only an issue when shooting RAW for long periods of time between downloading the data from the card, but it has been a limiting factor for me on a few occasions. Related: writing 20MB of RAW data to a card, no matter how fast, takes a long time. Expect to wait 3-4 seconds between RAW shots.Obviously, you cannot buy new lenses for this camera, although you can add wide-angle and macro attachments. When adding attachments, you will need an external hotshoe or off-camera flash due to the attachments blocking the on-camera flash.Speaking of the on-camera flash, it feels like an afterthought and produces deer-in-the-headlights effects in almost every situation. Any serious hobbyist will want an external or hotshoe.The intelligent ISO mode produces extremely noisy images in low light conditions. When I want a really good shot in such a situation, I switch to full manual, get out my tripod, set the shutter speed to the minimum, and use the delay timer to avoid jitter from pressing the shutter. It's unfortunate that you can get substantially longer exposures in the night scene modes, because they employ intelligent ISO. Panasonic warns against using any other remote shutter technology, and provides only a wired remote shutter release for this camera.USB transfer speeds from the camera are awful - slower than USB 1. You will absolutely need a card reader to get your data for processing. I purchased a 2GB high-capacity SD card that came with a special reader. Note that regular SD readers cannot handle the high-capacity cards.In conclusion: Clearly, there are limitations to this camera. Most of them could be remedied by spending thousands of dollars on a true DSLR. For the money, though, you can shoot like a pro and only your witnesses will know the difference.", "Date": "November 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great for beginners and media professionals", "Author": "Micheal Mathews", "ReviewID": "R250C0VS94NCNT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At the firm I work for we needed a quick solution for high resolution photo's that looked professional and could be taken on the fly. We also needed a camera that could shoot decent video.Well I found this camera and got both.First, this camera is excellent for hobbyists and beginner to intermediate photographers. It's not an SLR so theres a bit of seperation between you and the lense but it really doesn't make a big difference with this camera.I've had it and used it constantly for almost a year now and have yet to be let down. We have used it professionaly with excellent results.I bought my own for home soon after and I am still happy with my purchase.With a tripod and a remote you can get some great night shots, I've posted a few here.The camera also has a lot of great features for beginners like a grid that breaks your image into 3rds to help with composition and full auto or full manual everything.The Zoom is really impressive and the auto focus will rarely let you down.For manual focus the camera does a digital zoom preview so you can get a clear image of what you are focusing on before you snap the shot... brilliant!Ive noticed a lot of people complaining about terrible noise.The cameras ISO is set to 1600 by default.. at least mine was. 1600 will produce lots of grain. make sure you go in and set it to 100-200 for less grain if thats what you'd like.That said it's still got a bit of noise in the blue channel, this is usually due to compression techniques used to save files as jpeg.If you have a digital image editing software like photoshop you can open the blue channel run a noise reduction filter and most of the noise will disappear.Else Raw format may help eliminate a bit more noise but will take up more space on your card.It also takes the 4GB SD cards which I have also purchased and filled with video and photos twice now. A really nice feature for those who are sick of running out of space. Being that Im not a good photographer I'm usually lucky if I get 4-5 good shots out of 200, so Having a card big enough to hold all my failed attempts is very nice.Good battery life, especially if you only use the view finder.The LCD swivels and flips! This is great for getting shots where you can hold the camera away from your head and still see what your shooting.I've used it quite a few times now.I've also purchased the wide angle and teleconversion lenses as well as the remote for long exposures.The lenses dont make as big a difference as I'd hoped but they do give a bit of extra oomph to the camera.The remote is great if you can find it cheap.For the price this is such a great deal. I've recommended it to two of my friends so far and they are both thrilled with it.If your willing to learn a bit about photography and it's principles this is a great camera to get started with.Here's a couple cons though for the sake of being non-biased.It's kinda bulky, if your looking for a point and shoot you can take anywhere look for a smaller camera, this will not fit in your pocket or your purse.It has a limited lens selection. It's not an slr so additional lenses other than those made by panasonic for the FZ50 will need an adapter and wont produce the kind of results they will on SLR's.It's shaky! For some reason all of the big digitals I've used are just shaky cameras, maybe it's my hands but they seem to be really hard to hold still. Even though this camera has a nice stabilizer anything more than 1/20 and I get slight blur. Because of this I recommend a tripod and/or a remote for shots that you can take your time on.The built in flash is weak. It's not terrible by any means but it's not what you need for pro-quality shots most of the time. With some practice you may get some decent shots though.Bit of a learning curve.

I read every review about it I could find, I compared it to every other similar camera on the market, and eventually, I decided to take the plunge and buy it.The camera has not only met my expectations, it's exceeded them. It's basically got all the features of a digital SLR but without interchangeable lenses, but considering the fact that it's got a massive 12x and an optical image stabilizer to remove the blur you'd normally get at that end of the zoom range, I really don't care. If I want near-telephoto shots I can just zoom in. If I want super-wide shots I can just buy a wide-angle lens and screw it straight on. No changing of lenses required.This camera also has manual everything, tons of special shooting modes, and two features that really set it apart from similar cameras from Fuji and other brands: a manual zoom ring and a manual focus ring. I'm from the old school of film SLR photography and I really love being able to just grab a ring with one hand and turn it to get the focal length and focus I want quickly and selectively. I hate messing around with joysticks and rockers and other electronic doohickeys so the Panasonic's manual zoom and focus rings were really the deal-makers for me. I also love being able to shoot in different aspect ratios, at different megapixel levels, and at different quality levels, from standard JPEG right up to RAW. Yes, this camera shoots RAW, giving you the best possible post-processing options for your photos available. When I shoot high contrast photos, I expose for the highlights (like blue skies), shoot RAW, and then in post, I \"develop\" one exposure for the highlights, one exposure for the shadows, and combine the two in Photomatix to give me a beautiful, perfectly exposed image with a very wide dynamic range where you've got detail in both the highlights AND the deep shadows.A lot of users of this camera have complained about noise, and yes, it does creep in at low light levels, but it's nothing you can't easily remove with either Noise Ninja or Neat Image. If you use a tripod in low light and a low ISO combined with a slow shutter speed, you'll really have no problems, as with any pro camera. Otherwise, just use a flash! No biggie.Overall, I am completely in love with this camera.

These matters are really so minor that you have a hard time to find even these problems. The camera worked for me in a superior manner regardles of siruations and light conditions. I tried several other products of equal rank and the FZ50 outperformed every other camera even in higher price range.The handling and simplicity is amazing. I started in the automatic range and then studied my way through the about 140 page instruction manual, implementing the offered technology step by step. I now developed trust in this camera and learned to use all features. Perfect construction - solid and very handy. I guess the bit larger size is just one advantage for speedy and easy handling. Already after a very short time the handling becomes automatically without searching for the bottons because everything is set up great and the handling becomes natural.The only thing I was able to improve is the picture quality when using the flash. I added an additional flash which gives me a bit of a warmer tone compared to the build in flash.Great camera which comes to unbelievable great price, outperforming fashionable brands like Canon and others...The lens going practically to a zoom is the best and enables to go away from costly additional lenses.I am happy and certainly would buy the FZ50 anytime again.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "I did the research, so you don't have to", "Author": "Oskie Woskie", "ReviewID": "R3I3HRJCCD5QYA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched cameras for weeks relentlessly until I finally bought this camera. I read probably 300 reviews and articles about different cameras. I was starting to lose my mind, literally.  The problem is, for as many good things people have to say about different cameras, there are always plenty of negative comments that can scare you away. One person says the camera is too heavy, another says it is light...one says the pics look like crap, another says they are beautiful...Well, I finally pulled the trigger and bought the FZ50, and I can honestly say that it was a very wise decision.I am a novice at best with cameras.  I had no problem turning this camera on for the first time and immediately go right into taking great pictures. The auto mode allows me to do that. The pictures are crisp and clear even when blown up in to bigger sizes. The colors are wonderful. Yes, the pics are not quite up to the level of some dslr pics I've seen, but they are wonderful nontheless.The camera looks awesome, and feels great in your hands. It is a good size and weight. All of the controls are easily accessed right at your fingertips.One aspect of the camera that was impotant to me, but may seem silly, is that once it is focused, when I push the button down to take the picture, it clicks, and takes it right away.(unless you are using flash..(about a second delay)) this is very important to me because I cannot tell you how many great pics I've missed of my dogs or kids because my old camera didnt take the pic until 3 secs after I depressed the button. It was very frustrating.The best part of the camera is, like I said, you can take great pics right out of the box with the auto mode, but the camera has so many other modes and features to learn, that I can see myself learning new and exciting things and growing as a photographer throughout years to come. The camera really begs to be learned and challenges you to go out and take cool pics.The FZ50 is really a fun, easy (if you want it to be) camera and I suggest it to anyone who is looking for a camera in this price range.

It replaced the excellent FZ30 (which replaced an FZ20).  I also replaced the TZ3 with the TZ5 for a \"personal\" point-and-shoot camera, so have extensive experience with Lumix.  Tried D-SLRs, and other prosumer (mid-range) camera brands.  This is a prosumer camera.  A good Canon or Nikon D-SLR will take better pictures in many cases, but only if you can wade through the complex menus and understand more than the basics of photography, despite their claims for auto mode.  D-SLRs have more options in most cases, but several friends who went D-SLR, thinking they'd get just a fancier 35mm replacement, quickly became unhappy with the complexity, but where they could handle it, the pix were easier to handle in Photoshop 5.0, and a few with CS2.  Lumix has an excellent ability to \"read\" in the auto/scene modes.  The FZ50 does have some limitations with hard shadows (can mostly be compensated for), on occasion will be slightly slow in focusing, and its flash (typical in this price range) is barely ok.  It's only slightly smaller than a standard 35mm SLR.  It has difficulty with action shots: the faster the action the more likely you'll get blur (running, volleyball, etc.).  Use of an Extreme III or Ultra II (or other brands' equivalent) helps by speeding up the \"write to\" cycle significantly, but it just isn't a great action camera.  For less than fast action, especially for everyday sunlit or overcast pix, even with movement, it is exceptional.  I get many compliments for my work, and with 6.0 or CS3, the color is marvelous, only a hair below D-SLR.  The anti-shake helps my old hands (I was a pro 40 years ago).  I love the 12X zoom, and while 10.1 Mp files are very large, the 8 Gb (over 4,000 pictures possible), and 16 Gb SDHC cards (over 7,000 possible) are more than most prosumers will need.  My TZ5 (8 Mp) will also do over 4,000 with those cards (the counter doesn't go that high, just says \"999\").  The FZ50, while not a pocket camera, is reasonably light, if (like its 35 mm predecessors) slightly bulky, yet it fits my hand well, and rarely makes my hand/arm tired.  Relatively simple menu makes it easier and quicker for those of us who aren't high \"techies\" or quite as fast as we used to be.  Telephoto is quick and smoothe.  I hope Lumix continues putting out such great and quality features for a substantially lower price than a D-SLR, I'll keep upgrading.

I've taken the camera on two trips to Africa and a few other trips and have gotten some good shots.  On one of the trips I was with someone who had a Canon digital SLR and comparing shots about half of his were better than the ones I could get with the FZ50 and the other half you could not tell the difference.  This was in the same light, situation, and we were both using auto white balance, exposure, etc.  I know the FZ50 is not an SLR and probably if I had not had the other shots to compare, I probably would not have known any better.  I learned to just take a few more pictures and delete the ones I didn't like later.The FZ50 replaced a Konica Minolta Z3 and there are some things I like better about both.  The Panasonic has some neat features like a higher megapixel count, being able to get higher equivalent zoom rates by going down in megapixels (its using a smaller portion of the sensor and in effect cropping),  the rotating and tilt screen, and the manual twist zoom.  The biggest feature I missed from the Minolta was the progressive and high speed capture modes which were really useful trying to take wildlife or action shots.I really like the feel and usability of the FZ50.  I particularly love the manual, twist zoom.  It allows you some very fine control over the zoom versus a motorized zoom.  The controls are very intuitive and easy to use.  The rotating dials in the front and back of the camera are a great idea and very easy to use.  They can be used to control different things depending on mode and selections you make in the menu.  Another great feature is the program shift, where you can \"shift\" the aperture up or down from its automatic setting to be able have some control over depth of field.  A few times the auto focus seemed to have some problems focusing on the right thing and it was easy to use manual focus.  I found times when I was having trouble, the person with the SLR was having to manually focus too.  The quality of the pictures from a lens standpoint were great with no noticeable distortion in the entire zoom range.  the batteries have pretty good life, but if you are planning to do a lot of shooting I would recommend a second battery.  The Lenmar one Amazon sells is as good as the Panasonic one that comes with the camera.  As some of the others mentioned I would also get a fast memory card.As for the things I wish were better with the camera there aren't too many.  I wish there was some way to turn the noise reduction off.  In the pictures that I didn't feel were as good as the SLR, it was usually because some of the details were lost.  I did a little research and found that it may be due to the noise reduction.  It took a while and I found the noise reduction selection buried in the menu (its in the Pict Adjust section) and switched it from standard to low.  This seemed to help a little, but didn't totally solve the problem.  I wish I could turn the noise reduction totally off and see how the pictures looked then.  I really wish the burst mode was faster too or the camera had a high frame rate capture like my Konica Minolta had.I think this is a good camera for what it is and in spite of its limitations I like being able to only take one piece of equipment rather than having to lug lenses, separate flash, etc.", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Panasonic FZ50S camera makes taking pictures fun!", "Author": "J.

Eberhart", "ReviewID": "R1GZUV85X6AZRQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Too often people purchase a digital camera expecting the purchase price to increase with it's ability to capture high quality photographs. The reality is, a seasoned photographer could take better pictures with a good cellphone camera than a novice with a dSLR (digital single lens reflex) camera.What you get with a camera like the FZ50 is the ability to grow into the camera.You can begin with it in a fully automatic mode and with good composition skills you'll get good pictures.Once you learn all the features ALONG WITH the rules and techniques of photography, your pictures will improve.I've been taking pictures for over 30 years, and have gone through everything from 35mm rangefinders to a Hasselblad medium format camera. As for digital cameras, I started off with one of the first digital cameras, a huge Kodak camera that took 640x480 pictures (less than a megapixel) had a fixed lens, and cost about $1600 bucks. Since then I've been through a few smaller point and shoot cameras that were small enough to take everywhere. Recently I realized that I needed more camera than what fits in my pocket. I needed better quality, more zoom range, and the ability to use a high power flash. Initially I looked at dSLRs and decided that I didn't want to deal with multiple lenses, and having the burden of getting dust inside the lens/mirror/sensor anytime I did a lens swap. The FZ50 gives me a great choice of focal lengths...if I need to go wider than the lens, I can get an adapter. If I need to go longer, there's an adapter for that, and unless I start taking bird pictures or stalking my neighbors, I think I'll have enough zoom. What really excited me about the FZ50 were the manual controls on the lens. The focus and zoom rings still control servos that actuate the lens, but it feels like a manual lens, and it's faster as well as more precise than pushing buttons.After shooting with a Lumix TZ1, I knew that the Leica approved lens would be great.I'll leave it to the techies to discuss sensor sizes and all the electronics of the camera. All I really needed to know about the electronics was \"where do the batteries go\". If I planned on submitting pictures for Time magazine, I might be more interested in a larger sensor or better noise handling....but if I were doing this for a living, I'd probably have several dSLRs with different lenses on each one.I take pictures of family, friends, and things. I don't plan to print anything larger than 11x14 (a 4mp camera is adequate for that), and I actually plan to share most of the pictures digitally rather than printing....so large file sizes are not optimal. Another reason I opted against a dSLR is because I like to shoot video clips without carrying around a video camera. dDSLRs don't shoot video (maybe one day they will, but not today). Also, whereas many digital cameras don't allow you to zoom when shooting video, the FZ50 does.The FZ50 is great bang for the buck...it looks and feels like the 35mm SLRs that I grew up with. I looked at Canon's G9 and while it has similar features, it didn't look like a prosumer camera....at least not to a consumer. Sometimes it's important to pull out an SLR looking camera so that people will get out of your way. It distinguishes you from aunt Emily and her point-n-shoot pHD camera, but still simple enough that you can hand it to her and say, \"Press Here Dear\".All in all, it's a great camera for novice to intermediate photographers, with the controls an advanced shooter expects in a camera. If I were shooting professionally, this would be the camera I'd take on vacation to save the wear and tear on my work cameras. If I need to take a professional photograph for someone, this is a camera I can rely on for a high percentage of situations. Lots of room to grow into this camera, and while it does most of the things I'd like, I couldn't give it 5 stars because it's missing a wireless remote shutter control, it would be nice if the flip-out LCD came out far enough for when composing self-portraits and if was submersible like my wife's pHD camera...it would be perfect.  Again, the key to taking good pictures is not getting the most expensive camera...it's learning how to take good pictures with whatever camera you have.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent near -SLR camera", "Author": "A.

I took SHARP pictures that look TERRIFIC even when you zoom in, even better than my last camera.You should know it does NOT weigh 4 pounds as Amazon states; it is actually about a pound and a half. It's bigger and heavier than typical point-and-shoots (due largely to the big lens) and the case you have for your existing point-and-shoot will not fit, but the camera is light enough around the neck to satisfy most people.Surprisingly, the manual is pretty good! It gives you some idea what different modes and features are really useful for, and, when it references another topic covered elsewhere in the manual, it gives the page number so you can look it up.I also appreciate the ability to make fine adjustments quickly before you lose your shot; animals don't pose for long and without this feature, you would lose a lot of shots toggling through to different modes, or worse, switching to all-manual mode. It's like having limited manual flexibility in the different fixed scene modes -- the best of both worlds, so to speak, for anyone except a really experienced photographer who needs no help.My complaints so far are relatively minor:(1) The zoom is manual, a dial on the lens, rather than the motorized type you are probably used to. It's not as convenient to reach. If I could change one thing, that would be it.(2) The menu buttons are small. Why? There is plenty of empty space around them.(3) When you take a picture, it doesn't stay on the LCD screen long enough to get a good look at it.(4) The swivel rotatable screen works nicely, but is a bit small.(5) No lithium battery option, only the rechargeable pack (although it seems to last long enough with extensive LCD use). It seems to me regular lithiums lasted longer in my old camera than this battery pack does, but I DO LIKE the charger that is included with the camera.

With the 4x digital zoom (with expected decrease in image quality) you can really zoom in on things. Plenty of resolution/aspect ratio combinations to select from. Buttons are within easy reach. Changing things like ISO, image resolution, shutter and aperature are relatively easy. Flash has a pretty decent range for a built-in.  Image stabilization is great, but at high zoom, tripod or some kind of stable base is very helpful.Cons: A little on the heavy side and rather front-heavy. Make sure your tripod is good and stable if you're using one. Battery door is easy to accidentally open. Fortunately the battery latches in so it won't fall out if the door is accidentally opened.  LCD screen flips down (nice feature) and swivels to point out (useful for self-portraits), but for some reason the image doesn't invert itself (or I just haven't figured out how to make it invert yet) so you see an upside down image.Other Thoughts: 710 mAh Li-ion battery pack that has gotten me through at least 4-5 hours of shooting on a full charge. Purchasing an extra battery is probably a good idea. Combine it with an 8GB SDHC card and you can practically shoot forever. Would be cool if the function of the front and back dials could be customized. Use a separate card reader to get pictures off.  USB connection on this thing is S_L_O_W. Take the time to RTM.

I use these devices for my work as a glass artist and I view them from a very utilitarian perspective. The fine points of Venus engine noise issues and sensor size mostly escape me, and I do not analyze image quality with a magnifying glass. Nearly all digital camera images look good to me (Leica lens or not), just like nearly all pizza tastes good to me too. I needed a 10 meg sensor, an articulated lens and a good zoom all with decent battery life. The Lumix FZ 50 delivered on all. The 10 meg sensor was not so I could print out poster sized images with good resolution, but rather so I could shoot an image on site, and later on zoom into details I may not have paid attention to. With my previous 5 meg camera it pixelated too quickly, but the 10 meg gives me the \"blow up\" I wanted. The articulated lens is something I got used to on my Olympus C5060, and now deem a necessity. I regularly shoot over my head, on the floor, at myself, etc. and the movable LCD lets this happen easily. I never use digital zoom, so a good optical was important, and the FZ 50's is great. I particularly like; The zoom is manual so it is quiet, has less moving parts to fail, uses less power, and is fast. You can also decrease your resolution size and effectively increase your zoom to get really close without resorting to digital zoom. Hand in hand with the sizable zoom is the image stabilization. I had never had this in a camera before and would either lug my tripod around or search for some kind of bracing. While the stabilization is fantastic and does away with some of the aforementioned props, when doing an extreme zoom or very low level lighting I still use a tripod. Starting with a full charge the battery life is more than up to a typical days use for me, but I still bought two extras as their price is so low.  I only have a few improvements I would have liked. When using the LCD for a self portrait it does not invert the image. It is a little tricker to frame the shot when it is upside down, and I am puzzled as to why Panasonic did it that way. It would have also been better if the screen flipped out from the top, so you could use it  extended while also using a tripod. I would have like a wireless remote. The self timer and corded remote shutter release is OK up to a point, but if I want to get 40 feet away and do multiple shots the wireless would have allowed that. This camera will only shoot RAW and jpgs. Since I was used to TIFF as my default it forces me to think more about my file handling, but I am getting used to it. While the file sizes are smaller, I wonder why Panasonic did not give the user the option for that format.  In spite of my minor criticisms, I love this camera and have had no regrets. The more I use it the more I appreciate it.

No, the story is the lens. The clarity and color that comes out of this camera is just wackily good. And there's image stabilization so you can take advantage of its 420 (digital equivalent) millimeters so that speck on the horizon can become your subject. I am a writer. I need to think about what I'm seeing and hearing, so taking pictures is an afterthought. Now the camera thinks for itself so I can concentrate on the right things. Just set the knob to \"P\" and forget it. Also, a swivel-out viewer means you can shoot from the waist or with the camera over your head if necessary -- or you just want a more interesting angle.

I finally settled on the fz-50, actually was a choice between the 50 and the new fz-18.  I went with the 50 over the 18 because of the more dsl like size and weight, the manual zoom and focus rings (you can even zoom while shooting video!), the flip down screen (though smaller than I would like) and the flash hotshoe.  The 12x optical zoom is plenty for me, I can always add a telescoping lens to it later.  Right out of the box (minus some battery charging time lol) I was shooting some great photos in my backyard.

Again as with the previous 2, the FZ50 was an upgrade. I mainly upgrade to better enhance my photographic capabilities. I am far from being a pro but a notch higher than a novice. This camera provides flexibility and freedom to take your skills to the next level. First off, I like the 12x optical zoom (which can be extended up to 21x if you taper down the resolution). There are no gimmicks to this feature, what you see distance-wise in the EVF or LCD is exactly what the lens projects. The 10MP resolution is quite of an overkill considering that you can make oustanding prints in the 5-6MP range. Nevertheless, having the ability to increase/decrease the resolution is very handy and re-assuring. The swivel-screen LCD is also a dynamic feature. Very incrimental if you need to compose an angled shot. The function button (as with the joystick with the smaller FZ models) is a nice feature to have if you want to jump in directly to some features without a longer scroll time on the menu button. The ability to handle SDHC is great considering a lot of the memory cards out there now are high-capacity. The camera itself is light enough to carry for extended periods of time. The flash is strong enough for normal conditions although I would advise you to buy an external flash if you need to compose shots in extra-ordinary conditions. The ergonomics of this camera is simply amazing! I do not have huge hands but it seems to fit my hand at just the right place. Shutter buttons and all the other buttons are easily accessible. There's not a lot of unnecessary movement required. Everything is within handy reach. The ability to shoot at ISO values up to 1600 goes hand in hand with the new OIS abilities although I seldom require shooting at those high ISO figures. The Venus III engine is superb although in my experience, you have to fine tune the NR down to its lowest level (or turned off in some cases) to get an outstanding shot. The MEGA OIS works just right and works all the time. You can actually do a test yourself composing a shot, with the OIS turned ON/OFF to see the difference. And the good thing is, YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE! You also have the ability to do RAW with this camera but it is slow. JPEG is still the best. Unless you have a good photo editing software, JPEG will suit you fine in normal operating conditions. The Leica Lens is just superb, sharp and outstanding.

The Panasonic DMC-FZ50 was released in 2006 and it's showing its age. While it still delivers respectable results, it is not quite on par with Pansonic's latest releases and those from other manufacturers. I'm not sure why it's current cost on Amazon is in the five hundred dollar range, so I would respectfully suggest considering the more advanced Fujifilm X-S1 12MP EXR CMOS Digital Camera with Fujinon F2.8 to F5.6 Telephoto Zoom Lens (24-624mm). It has a lower price point, a larger sensor, and offers a lot more bang for the buck when it comes to image quality and overall performance.If you are still set on a Panasonic Lumix bridge camera, I suggest looking at the LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD. It is for some reason currently priced much less than the FZ50, and is much more advanced. It or the Fujifilm FinePix S1 are current leaders in the Bridge/Super-Zoom camera category. If you are still set on getting the FZ50 after considering those two options, know that you'll be getting a solid camera with decent image quality and a plethora of features.  It is dated however, and the image quality at ISO 400 and above could be better. I believe I purchased mine in 2007 and I've never had a problem with it, so if build quality and dependability is a major factor for you, then rest assured that the DMC-FZ50 delivers.~ Kort", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "I still use this and can't let it go", "Author": "Wii Wack", "ReviewID": "R3283NAX7DGADY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the camera that got me into photography.

Get yours while it lasts: Panasonic has said it will make no more in this FZ series.I won't try to compete with the reviewers with OCD who salivate over its technical characteristics. But you will feel good about owning this, believe me.Get an aftermarket extra battery (lots cheaper than Panasonic's) for those times when you want to capture wide screen video (Yaaaaa! and you can zoom while shooting) along with an SDHC category 6 memory card (for under $80 you can get 16GB cards now!!!!).You can get accessory lenses but from my experience with a cheaper tele adapter you would be best to pay Panasonic's prices for their tele and wide-angle lens adaptors.As someone who used to lug around heavy SLR film cameras with a raft of lenses, flash, etc., I have never looked back after using this.

The most important requirement that I had was that the camera I bought had sharp focus.  The leica lens on this camera is superb.  All of my shots are crystal clear on what I wanted to focus on.The center weighted auto focus works superbly allowing me to get sharp focus on close or distant objects and disregarding unwanted objects like a car or bushes or a stranger that can't be avoided.  There are also 9 point, 3 point and spot focus if you want them.  There is an auto focus assist lamp built-in to allow focusing in dim light.The optical image stabilization in the lens is also superb.  I can hand hold at full 420mm zoom (12x) and still get sharp focus.  There would be no way I could do that without the OIS in the lens.  Goes without saying that the OIS works superbly at the wide end of the lens too since the long end is the hardest.The manual zoom ring on the lens.  This is absolutely superb and I can never go back to toggle button zoom.  The focus ring on the lens when manually focusing on a bird through branches or a subject through glass is superb and I can't imagine not having it.  BTW, the zoom is non-extending and completely contained within the lens.  Therefore air is not sucked into the camera by an extending lens when zooming which can allow sucking in dust too.The hot shoe allows mounting an external flash and using TTL (Thru The Lens) exposure metering.  I bought a FL50 flash and it works perfectly with the FZ50 using TTL.  I can take bounce flash photos at parties that can look like the pro photos now.Don't let reviews of poor low light operation scare you off.  Think about what you normally shoot.  Outdoors during the day?  Indoors using the flash?  Outdoors at night using the flash?  This camera can take great, clean looking shots in those conditions using no flash or the built-in flash.  With an external flash it's even better.  99% of my photos are in prints of 4x6 or 5x7 inches.  They look great.  The few 8x10 photos also look great.  I've read that 13 x 19 inch prints from this camera also look great.  There may be a slight issue with noise in low light situations where you cannot use flash but those shots will probably be better than your current point & shoot so not to worry.  But what percentage of your shooting is in a low light situation?  If shooting low light, switch the camera to RAW and remove noise in post processing.There are so many other functions that are super.  Live histogram overlay on the LCD screen or in the viewfinder allows setting the right exposure \"before\" taking the shot under difficult situations.  Tic-tac-toe grid overlay allows composing the shot properly and level.  Exposure bracketing with 3 rapid shots (darker, mid, lighter) to insure you get the right exposure.  Burst mode when you need to take photos rapidly, either 3 shots or to the end of memory if you like.  The list goes on and I can't mention them all.I don't have the least regret buying my FZ50.  I don't have to change lenses to get 12x zoom like most DSLR camera with kit lens have to do.  I'm estatic with the sharpness of my photos.

McDonald", "ReviewID": "R26TXLPLZ892IB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first went looking for a good camera in 2006, I was looking for something that would take the place of my Canon EOS Elan IIe.  I was a small-time/part-time professional photographer that did everything from catalogs to weddings.  My last Canon was the last film body in a line of Canons dating back more than twenty years, so I have a lot of equipment that is dedicated to the EOS line.  When I looked for my next camera, it only made sense to look hard in the Canon line-up.  Making a long story short, Canon did not have enough features that I valued to justify the expense of one of their digital bodies.  When I thought to look into something a little more complete I stumbled across the FZ-50 as well as a number of other all-in-ones.  With the Leica \"stamp\" on the lens with a host of applicable features, I paid approximately $550 for a camera.  The camera was everything I had hoped it would be and more. With its sharp lens full of contrast, stunning color, and responsiveness, I decided to shoot a summer outdoor wedding.  Say what you want about the designed purpose of this camera, but when I was finished with that job, not only did it land me two other weddings which were both sisters of the bride but also the brother of the groom.  I will say that the next wedding that I shot I intended to shoot fully with my FZ when the bride informed me last minute that the ceremony was going to be entirely candle lit and she didn't want any flash work.  Oh-no.  The FZ would have done a horrible job at these low light conditions.  I managed to borrow a friend's Canon 20D just for those low light shots - that saved the day.  What's the point?  If you're a novice, I don't want to lose you in techno-jargon, but shooting a hand-held camera with subjects moving that are only lit by candlelight is a fantastically difficult challenge even with the 20D.  But the difference is that the 20D gave images whose short-comings didn't distract from the final product.  But listen carefully.  Does this make the FZ a poor instrument?  Of course it doesn't.  Just because a dump truck cannot speed at 100mph doesn't make it useless, because that wasn't the original intent of the designer.  Just because my sports car doesn't haul three yards of rock, doesn't make it useless either. As of this writing, cameras still struggle to offer high ISO low light images that are as clean as day light 100 ISO shots.  As technology advances and years pass, consumers find themselves dissatisfied with the outer limits of their last camera's capabilities and demand better performance.  But what is wrong with great equipment no matter the year produced?  I still have a Canon A510 Power Shot that I got in a trade.  It's a 3.2 megapixel camera that still takes the same stunning pictures that reviewers were praising it for back in 2005.  The only difference is that we have newer techno-gadgets to get excited about (my Sony TX-5 is the \"G Shock\" of cameras and is smaller than a deck of cards).  The A510 gives me really nice 8x10s prints and excels at product photos for websites. So when it comes to the FZ-50, why do I keep it after all these years?  Like most people who have commented on these reviews, the FZ has a lens on it that is hard to beat.  Its range can leave you somewhat dissatisfied when you drop it and pick up another camera.  It is impressively sharp at any range and is fully controllable.  I do not have to wait for the zoom motor of an all-in-one nor do I have to bring a bag of lenses as with my DSLR.  With a flick of the wrist, I am composing my shots quickly and taking pictures.  These shots that I'm taking will be infinitely better than the images I missed while switching lens on my superior DSLR.  The optical stabilization (OS) system is very effective.  I find myself producing hand held images at the longest focal length at very slow speeds.  I would have to say that it is just as effective as my Canon G12's OS - despite the fact that it is a number of years older and the focal length much longer.  The fixed lens means that I do not have to worry about dust on my sensor - ever.  Fixed also means that all the action takes place within the barrel length you see - whether zooming or focusing.  Zooming does not increase or diminish the lens length and focusing does not rotate any part of the lens on the outside.  That is bad if you want something more compact, but good if you want to use the camera for macro or keep you polarizer set.  Speaking of polarizers, the lens also has filter threads which delights me as much as the Leica quality.  Why don't manufacturers' put these handy threads on all but the most simplistic point and shoots?  The effects of a polarizer cannot be reproduced in post-production software.  The protection that the UV filter offers is also a comfort. The image quality as I have stated is great.  If you are the type of person that will only view 1/1000th of your image on a huge monitor and baulk at any stray dot that you manage to find, keep looking for that magical camera.  Your pictures with all of its clarity and richness and detail-perfection will still be crap if you do not adopt the fundamentals of great photographs as it pertains to composition, color (and/or contrast), angle, and subject.  A professional camera (or any camera) will not give you great professional images any more than being in McDonald's will convert you into a great hamburger.  The flip side is also true.  Put practically any camera into the hands of a great photographer, and you will get compelling images.  Night shots that are taken low ISO look wonderful.  Colors are punchy and leave some of my DSLR lenses wanting.  Contrary to what you may have read from a number of pro-critics' sites, I will report that the images look detailed and beautiful when captured up to ISO 800 and printed at 8x10.  I say that as I look at a senior portrait that I did at those two parameters.  The image was taken manual mode, 13mm (62mm 35equiv) focal length, 1/50th of a second at f3.2.  The Venus Engine has nicely smoothed skin while allowing sharpness not only in a tight-knit sweater that is imaged all the way to the bottom right corner (still sharp), but also in the glossy reflections found in the eyes of the subject.  What more could you ask for?  The image has all the indications that the camera may very well surpass that in terms of capability (a bigger enlargement out of ISO 800), I just haven't enlarged a print passed that at ISO 800.  This same image is on my 24\" monitor and I'm looking at it from a view that would make the entire image bigger than a poster and it still looks good (not GREAT, but good).  Isn't that enough camera for you? The shutter-less camera is also a favorite with subjects that are timid in front of a camera.  This not only applies to humans who look so much better being imaged while relaxed and confident, but also to birds, and other skittish wildlife.  I have been able to image so many more shots of animals because the camera is completely silent.  Once again these images prove to be so much better than the ones I didn't get on my DSLR because the camera was making too much darn noise.  One senior picture shoot, the girl was so nervous that I told her that we were just practicing and that I was not going to be taking pictures until later.  We were half way through before she figured out I had been taking pictures all along (beautiful pictures) - you can't do that with a DSLR clacking away every time you release the shutter.  More advanced up-scale cameras are now equipped without mirrors - imagine that. I may eat my words with the next statement, but I will never buy a serious camera that doesn't have a fully articulating live view screen.  What incredible flexibility you have when you can flick that camera in all manners of positions and compose a shot.  I've mounted an inverted Takumar lens for amazing macro photography that would be insanely difficult to manage without the articulating screen. I suppose that I will eventually stop using the FZ-50 but that will only happen when they come out with a camera that has manual control over an all-in-one lens (with this much focal reach or more) that is as capable as the Leica.  It must also have an articulating screen with silent shutter release.  Currently I use a Canon DSLR for most portrait (except as mentioned previously), my G12 is now the one I take with me on vacations and weekend trips (used to be the FZ), and the Sony TX-5 goes with me wherever.  I like taking the FZ mostly for nature and wildlife.  With the type and distance of hiking I do, I don't want to pack all my DSLR stuff and the G12 doesn't reach far enough.

With it's top-notch Leica optics, it's undoubtedly a better camera than I am a photographer. If there are any shortcomings, they are minor--the lack of a flash sync socket or a \"bulb\" option on the shutter release being the only two things I've found bothersome. An inexpensive (around $20) hot shoe adapter will take care of the flash sync issue but there's no easy work-around for the shutter release limitation so if you're considering this camera for low-light, tricky flash or astronomical photography, you should look elsewhere. And, of course, the auto-focus and auto-exposure modes can occasionally be flakey, just as with any other automatic camera. Bracketing is always a good idea, especially since the camera makes it so easy to do. But good points of the FZ-50 far outweigh these minor shortcomings. As I mentioned, the optics are as good as you'll find anywhere and the ability to focus, zoom and and adjust exposure settings with honest-to-god, old-fashioned rings on the lens barrel if you choose are almost worth the price of admission all by themselves. No switch-controlled zoom motors in this camera--a huge plus in my book.All that said, I'm not sure the camera is worth the current price, which is nearly double what I paid for mine.

Vu \"kool100vr4\"", "ReviewID": "R1PANFCOCXVYK8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, i have just purchased the Panasonic FZ50 for about 3 weeks now, after about 600 test shots with it i have come to a conclusion that this FZ50 is by far the best FZ i've ever own. I have owned FZ7, FZ10, FZ15, FZ20(2), FZ30 and now FZ50. No surprise to me, this FZ50 IS out do the rest of its family, by far as image quality, FZ50 gives almost perfect pictures, the sharpness from its Leica lens is amazingly sharp, full of details contrast, full of depth of field, im very pleased with it..I must say its got some noise from iso 100 to 800, but i know it before hand, so now i use noise reduction software to remove it afterward easily..i think most all point and shoot cameras do have noise issue, so this is no exception.I have put it thru the iso tests, i shot at all iso setting from 100-1600, the results were very pleased, from iso 800 i can see noise creeping in, then comes iso 1600 it shows even more, but both can be a quick fix to me..both were usable images.Now!, comes the colors, i think FZ50 has a bluish cast to all images, but FZ50 has a custom white balance 1 and 2, so i usetilized that by set a custom w/b 1 for the outdoors and 2 for indoor w/o flash. they turned out perfectly, totally awesome..I must also mention about the bokeh, FZ50 has a minimum of bokeh at tele end, therefore it gives you extra depth of field. I love this camera for its tele, at max 420mm at f3.7 it produces very sharp, contrasty images. Anyone who tries to buy that big lens at 400mm f3.5 you will pay an arm and a leg for DSLR use and you will need a pro tripod to hold it sturdy, but not on FZ50 i can shoot it handheld w/o any problem due to its OIS optical image stabilizer.I also add on the Raynox wide angle 0.72x adapter to it so i can get the range from 25mm to 420mm..What a range for anyone to have for everyday use.I also bought the 3rd party battery grip holder for it too, the grip holds 2 batts, i can shoot for a week or about 500 shots.Finally. I love this camera, i want to carry it with me everywhere now. I may try to use it in my studio soon..Good luckChaoJV", "Date": "March 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Initial opinion - I like it!", "Author": "Michel Du Chaussee \"Micheld2\"", "ReviewID": "R37NAILLRQ265A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera just a about 4 weeks now and I must say I'm impressed by what I've seen so far.I used a Fuji s5100 for 2 years prior to this and so I had to get used to the larger size and weight of the FZ50. I was also considering the Fuji s9100 but having blurred many a shot (I know-tripod)with the s5100 due to hand shake at lower speeds I decided to try the FZ50 because of the optical image stabilization (OIS) and I have seen a great reduction in blurred results. The 12X zoom is amazing (actually 13.4x at 8 megapixels) and lens clarity superb.The only thing I find negative is the color saturation. I find my Fuji produces more vibrant colors that stand out or \"pop\". I do more saturation adjustments in Photoshop than before. Of course I'm still learning the nuances of this camera so it may be too early to tell.The 32 meg card is a joke so I got a 2 gig SD and I'm burning my photos to disc much more frequently so as not to use up HD space on my computer (which you should do anyway). So far I'm very happy with it but I reserve further comment as my proficiency grows.

The pictures are sharp, the camera feels great in the hand, full manual controls are wonderful and it packs more in a small package than you can likely get anywhere else.  My only gripe is that they REDUCED the frame rate from the previous two releases of the high-end FZ series.  I'm sure there's a good reason but for me it makes no sense.  I think it's max speed now is 1-2 frames per second.

I had a 35mm Sigma SA7 SLR with two lenses: a 28-70mm & 70-300mm (which I still use ocassionally) before I got this Lumix FZ50. The FZ50 does the job of both lenses (except wide angle not as good as the 28mm). You may need a wide angle conversion lens which I plan to buy as soon as I have extra money so I can get extra wide shots. So now I carry one camera instead of the 35mm camera plus two lens and covers & hoods. It's a lot easier when I go out just to have fun. I also learned how to make the 12X zoom even more. Instead of 10MP you can set the camera to 5MP or 3MP and get SUPER MEGA EXTENDED OPTICAL ZOOM!!! Plus I haven't even used the digital zoom yet!!! The flip-out LCD screen is awesome since I can rotate it anyway I want which is helpful when I'm standing infront of the camera and trying to set up a shot or shooting over a wall or crowd of people. The battery lasts a decent amount of time & it takes great videos. I took this camera to Jamaica in August and I have awesome pics to show. The tropical colors & beaches are vivid and everyone says the pictures look like post cards or magazine pictures. The bottom line is this: It's expensive but worth it. It takes great pictures. It has 99% features of an SLR camera without all the extra lenses. I can do a lot of stuff in the manual mode just as I do with my SLR. It fits nicely in my hands with the controls & menus easily accessed. Oh by the way you can add audio to the pictures when you take them or after you decide to keep a picture. That's a cool feature because I can take a picture make comments about the scence or subject so later when I'm reviewing them I know exaclty what I was thinking. If you are just learning to take pics like me, it's good to remind yourself what ISO or f/stop or focal length or shutter speed etc was used. After a while you'll teach yourself some tricks of the trade. You will need 2GB SD cards or higher if you take pictures of everything like me and you can get accesories cheap if you buy nonbrand names. I highly recommend this camera except for the wide angle is not that wide it's only about 38mm eqv.

I really like the ease of use of the digital format. I decided to keep with the big zoom all in one camera because of the problem of dust that I used to have with my old SLR film cameras, and that I'd read about with Digital SLR's also. I've been taking lots of pictures as I'm learning all the features this camera has over my previous Panasonic FZ-3. And in another review I'd read and agree with, STUDY and READ the manual!! Especially if you're doing anything more than just point and shoot in auto program mode.So far, love it! Down in price now to a great deal. It's a large camrea, and a little heavy which I like to assist in keeping steady for some shots. Zoom is great as always. You can adjust resolution from RAW all the way down to 2 MP. 10 MP is great for croping zooms on shots and still keep the clarity, which is why I wanted this camera to begin with. I have to have a viewfinder as my getting older eyes can't adjust with just a view screen like so many cameras only have now. All info appears in the viewfinder or the flip down and rotatable view screen off the back. I like that the view screen can be stored in a closed position to protect it.

You don't need to sign in to do this, click on the link and pick the camera from the lists and you can check out all types of pictures taken by just that model of camera. Its really great.

At any rate, i was not also really totally satisfied with the quality of the pictures due to its over-bearing noise reduction system.

I've had mine for a couple of years now and have used it on a few trips and vacations. I had hoped that because this fell in the moderate price range and it had manual operation it would be a good tool to teach myself more advanced shooting before I spent the big bucks on a DSLR. I found the features difficult to access through the menu. Get yourself a translator for the manual. The pictures are OK but not great. Various lens extensions I have bought are very ineffective and difficult to mount.AND HERE\"S THE CLINCHER AND WHY I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS AFTER 3 YEARS!!The LCD screen quit on me with only very limited use but after warranty coverage. Panasonic tells me it has to be sent to a repair location half way around the country from where I live. I can't contact anyone at the facility, there is no direct number. Panasonic can't provide ANY tech support or advice through customer service and has no other way for recent but non warranty covered customers to get any help.Oh yeah, they said contact Walmart (not) or Best Buy because they have Panasonic Certified Tech's. BB won't touch it because I didn't buy it there. Finally Ritz camera offers a repair option that starts at $269.00 for this camera. They are simply the middleman.So if you buy this and it holds up, congratulations. I don't recommend it because of what I described. If you're just starting out get yourself a Canon PowerShot SX 100 IS or something similar. I bought my wife one and she still uses it for graphic work and gets great pleasure from the ease of use and great pictures.

That being said . . .I bought this camera almost exactly two years ago and was very pleased with the quality of the pictures and the ease of use.  Then, one day it just died on me.  I went on the Panasonic website and filled out a repair order, gave them my credit card info for the diagnostic charge and mailed it to their repair center.Ten days later I called to get a status on the repair and was told they had not even looked at it yet because I had not paid the diagnostic charge.  I gave the representative the info on the confirming email I have received and she said she'd take care of it and I would be contacted within the week with a status report.A week later when I called again, I was told, again, that I had not paid the diagnostic charge therefore no one had looked at the camera.  There was no record of my conversation from the week before and, unfortunately, I had not gotten the name of the representative to which I had spoken.  I then gave them my credit card number, again, and was told I'd be contacted within the week with a status.After another week, I called back to be told that the repair center was backed up and they had not had an opportunity to look at the camera.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was assured by Joe Martinez that he would have an answer for me by the end of the day and would call me back in person.  He not only didn't call me back but when I called him two days later he still didn't have an answer.Finally, after over a month of back and forth, I was told that the entire lens needs to be replaced at a cost of $382.08.  Now, I realize that the camera is only warranted for one year but it seems that the lens on a $600 camera should not need to be entirely replaced after only two years.Therefore, I tell you not to buy this camera.  Not only is it unreliable but dealing with Panasonic is an exercise in frustration.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "CALL PANASONIC! Lovely camera--but needs better AV out", "Author": "Sprocketgrrl", "ReviewID": "R1NLXET9N8RVVL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this camera based on the reviews I've read here and all over the web.  It's fantastic and it definitely merits the great reviews.  The Leica lens is a beautiful thing.However, I have been trying to run the digital video directly into my Mac (so I can view the live feed on my computer) and, to my dismay, the only AV cable provided ends in an RCA (analog) terminus.  This means that I have to buy an analog-to-digital converter box in order to take the DIGITAL SIGNAL from the DIGITAL CAMERA and have it read by the computer.Makes lots of sense, doesn't it.  (Especially since TV signals by law have to be digital now, so your average TV is probably going to phase out the analog i/o altogether.)I called Panasonic to see if they make an AV cable that ends in a DV terminus.  They do not.  I put in a request that they do so.  The guy took down my request but explained that they would have to look at the economics of it.  Grrrr.But if they get enough requests, they might do it.  So if you have any interest in viewing live feed on your computer or via the digital input on your telly, please call Panasonic and add your voices to mine, so they make this cable!  After all, it's kind of weird that you can't just plug and play--a design flaw?  Or a marketing ploy since they might want to force you to buy the camcorder?That's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  Still have to experiment and get to know the features better, but it takes lovely pictures, feels great in your hand and gives you a lot of control.  BTW: definitely buy a larger memory card.  You can find them online for fairly cheap these days.

Nonetheless, there is one point to be considered: a camera at this price does not have any kind of sealing against moisture, sand or dust. After two years of use it began to freeze. I sent to Panasonic Service Center near Chicago and after six months they sent it back telling me it was better trash it than fix it because the circuits were rusty with moisture. I opened the set to take a look and for my surprise I found out the chassis(board) where the circuits are mounted is the same chassis(board) that hold the straps we use around the neck. Everything else around is just a thin skin, as I told, without any kind of sealing.Just for you understand what I say is that right now this camera is for sale at 996US$ at Amazon. For 769US$ I bought a Pentax K20D with one lens. The pentax K20D is completed sealed against anything. So, a trashable camera like Lumix DMC FZ50 should cost no more than, let's say 150US$, despite Leica's lenses.
