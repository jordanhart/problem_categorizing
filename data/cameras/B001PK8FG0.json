With the onset of dementia, his lifelong hobby of photography and home-movie making was becoming a major challenge for him (couldn't remember how to load film, how to transfer media, etc).  I wanted a digital with a very easy user menu that I could set on \"auto\" mode so that he could maintain as much independence as possible with his photography without getting frustrated by new technology. He mastered the camera in one afternoon (which was a big deal, as other tasks, like using a basic telephone, were too complicated). The camera is used every day, has been dropped, left in the driveway overnight, and stepped on a few times. I had to replace it with an identical L19 when he broke the door that holds the batteries (the camera still worked with a small piece of duct tape holding the door closed, but he wouldn't stop fiddling with the tape and the batteries kept falling out, so I inherited the first one and got him a second.)  It went through the washing machine accidentally last weekend. We did not have high hopes for recovery and I was preparing to order a THIRD, but after letting it dry out for a few days, we turned it on, and miraculously, it worked perfectly!!!Pros:1. This camera is very easy to use, even for someone new to digital, and in our case, someone with moderate dementia. The menu is intuitive. I imagine that it would also made a great first camera for kids.2. Photo quality is decent. We've captured some great shots that have enlarged well. For household use, (thousands of pictures of flowers, dogs, and people eating) this camera is great.3. It did survive the washing machine with a full load.Cons:1. It requires the more expensive batteries designed for high-end digital electronics (ie: \"ultimate lithium\"). It wouldn't work properly with regular AA's; it would take just a few photos before saying that the battery was exhausted. With daily use, we change them every ten-fourteen days, but this is not a deterrent for us as a user-friendly camera and some independent activity is worth the investment.All in all, a great camera for my grandfather who is 97 now and still using it every single day.

I have gone through at least 10 digital cameras in the past 2 years (all were stolen or broken purposefully by a*holes...)  and now I have 2 digital cameras plus the one on my Blackberry... recording equipment of any kind is like a weapon I use, instead of real weapons...  (Nikon Coolpix L19 and  a Canon 10.1, very similar to the Nikon but actually I like the Nikon better. They are around the same price/look.)I love this camera so much and USE it so much that I am willing to TAPE the darn battery-door shut to make it work... I know the latch can be fixed somehow but I don't have $ to fix it and when I do get $, I am robed.  I know, the world IS out to get me.

I DO like the AA battery vs. lithium battery; I lose the lithium batteries and they cost my too much to replace.
