The camera itself is poorly designed.  The internal memory will not store even one picture.  You lose everything when the camera is turned off.  The picture quality is so poor they really are not worth saving.  We purchased a memory card for this camera thinking that might help.  This camera will not accept the memory card.  The memory card works with other cameras we have, but not this one. Save your money.  This is a toy at best.  We are very disappointed in this product.", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000FL4GE0"}}
