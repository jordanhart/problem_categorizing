{"Reviews": [{"Title": "can't beat fuji color", "Author": "J. Bailey", "ReviewID": "R3U3TN2X9FXPDM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have many cameras, including a Nikon D50, an Olympus SP-500UZ, a Canon Powershot A540, a Fuji Finepix A360, a Nikon Coolpix 5700, and of course this one, the Fuji Finepix A600.  My favorite compact is the Canon A540, BUT - its just a bit too big to carry on your belt 24/7, which is what I do with this Fuji.  What I like about the Fuji cameras is the color.  Fuji colors just seem to pop off the screen to me.  I can usually tell when browsing Flickr, or other photo sites, which pictures were taken with a Fuji before I look at the specs.I would give this Fuji 5 stars if they increased battery life a bit, improved the rather crappy preview screen, and added a few more manual controls.  But the pictures I've taken with it I love - and I love its portability, and the fact that it uses AA batteries. (I hate proprietary batteries...) I'd recommend it, particularly for a carry everywhere camera.", "Date": "November 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice camera, light and compact, easy to use.", "Author": "J. Rivera", "ReviewID": "R3H3INQC7O0D0M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I wanted a smaller, lighter, digital camera with a larger LCD screen.  I am very pleased with the quality of this camera for this price range.  I find  it simple to use and just right for someone who enjoys a point and shoot camera without too many confusing buttons on the outside.  The movie mode is great for capturing those special moments when you do not have your cam corder handy. It takes great pictures and is easy to carry around with you.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "FUJIFILM FINEPIX A600 6.3 MP CAMERA", "Author": "Kenneth W.

Roda", "ReviewID": "RKDJ3ZLEKH05D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a 35 mm Nikon and love the quality of the pics.  So, I was skeptical to purchase a digital camera and be dissapointed by the quality of the pictures compared to the 35mm.I was not dissappointed.  This camera is easy to throw in the glove compartment/jacket pocket, etc.  The quality of the pictures is great.  Dowload to the software, is fast and easy (I use various softwares) and print at home.I have enlarged pictures to a 8x10 and had no pixelated pics.The colors are sharp and the Super ccd has a lot to do with it, the mega pixels does not determine the quality of the picture.I use rechargeable batteries and always carry a charged spare.  It does eat up the batteries quickly, but with rechargeables around, it is not a problem.I shoot a lot of pictures and this has been extremely easy to use and download.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the battery issue, but I could give it 5 because even and 8 yr old could use it.The learning curve is intuitive is you don't want to use the manual.Firmware upgrade found easily on Fuji's website.", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "This is one smokin camera", "Author": "DVDKORNDOGG", "ReviewID": "R1VYN9G8DTDHFX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is sweet.  Just got pictures back from Walmart.  Can't even tell they came from a digital camera.  Look as good as a 35mm.

I had a Fujifilm finepix 2650, but on the 28th of May, the last day of my vacation I dropped it taking what was going to be the last picture before we headed home, after that I couldn't get the lens to focus, so the hunt was on for a new one, I knew I wanted a Fuji because I really liked my 2650, but I couldn't find that model; except one's that were refurbished and I didn't want to go that route. I looked at this camera and it had everything I was looking for and more. I'm very happy with my purchase and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one or maybe two, especially from this seller, excellent service and fast delivery. It takes beautiful pictures, it's very easy to navigate, and I love the fact that there's sound on the video clips, that's something the 2650 did not have. I haven't been able to put this thing down. Thank you Amazon and buyers_store excellent service as always. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who is in the market for a new camera.Bonaroo", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Decent", "Author": "S. Clary", "ReviewID": "RKEHZ6FWEUBKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Canon SLR camera and it has been my carry everwhere camera for many years.  It's big and bulky!  I finally broke down and bought this compact easy-to-carry camera for taking snapshots after researching different brands/models.  I can honestly say that I am not disappointed in the least.  My SLR will take better quality pictures overall, but it is tiresome to carry around and set up.  The picture quality of the finepix camera is GREAT!  Even enlargements look crisp and clear... I've enlarged some of mine to 16x20.  The one downside, it burns batteries extremely fast. I would invest in some good rechargeable ones if purchasing!", "Date": "March 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not Like Your Other Fuji!", "Author": "R.

But, this one is different.  The metering is way off, even when I shoot it on manual and adjust the white balance the results are not as good as with my old MX 1700. Additionally, the focus is not as crisp as with my other 2 Fuji's.Although it has some nice features it does not not fulfill the basic function of a decent quality point and shoot.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Be prepared for the heartbreak of losing pictures", "Author": "KP \"KP\"", "ReviewID": "R1WPXQV2IHCUUZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera takes great quality pictures I'll give it that and the battery life is fair at best. But be prepared to lose pictures! The camera has a poor design of not warning you that you have run out of space on a memory card and will then start to save on the camera's own memory. From my experience you have about a 50/50 chance of being able to download the overflow of pictures that saved on the camera. But the worst part is that this camera is notorious for a random formatting (\"Card not initialized\") error. You have about a 20% chance of recovering your photos under this circumstance. I once tried 4 different data retrieval softwares with no luck to get back precious photos that are now gone forever. I am in the process of buying a new non-Fuji camera now because I can't stand the heartbreak of losing any more photos. But don't just take my word for it.

I bought this camera and 7 others used on ebay(different brands and models) for use in the computer lab by students ages 6 and up. This one is the easiest to use. It does exactly what a kid thinks it will do and it does it well. When you push the button, it takes a picture right now, no delay, no confusion, just a good picture. Using 2400 mah rechargeables, the flash recharge is FAST, one or two seconds and its ready to take another. This is a minimalist's camera, no distracting switches like the used canon powershot A400 or S45, no dials to accidently rotate and mess up the setting like the Nikon Coolpix 3200, or the Olympus D 425 or D 595. No strange proprietary batteries or memory card like the Sony cybershot DSC -T1. It uses AA batteries, and a standard SD card and a normal usb cable to transfer pictures without special software.  Best of all the camera has been used by many,  many carefree 7 year olds and has consistently taken sharp, clear images that we have used in multimedia projects. If this camera were a car, it would be a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla, reliable, predictable, a bit pedestrian, but a keeper nonetheless. If you can find a good one of these used for thirty dollars give or take ten, grab it.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera.......for one year only", "Author": "pink eye", "ReviewID": "R3QUY3ZAQPZ0TK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera was everything I could ask for.

Its been dropped it a zillion times, accidentally had sugary liquids splashed on it (which gummed up the lens cover and buttons) have left in hot / cold cars, and it had a lengthy stint in a stuffy attic for storage as well.  In between all that I've literally taken thousands of pictures with it. Still takes photos today as good as the day I got it.  As with any point and shoot in this price range indoor photo quality is hit and miss without a flash (absolutely fine with flash on) but anything moderately lit comes out great.The optical zoom quality is impressive for a camera in this price/spec range; did some recent photos at an indoor sporting event from a considerable distance away from the playing field, and the photos were crisp with no blurring.  The menu settings are plentiful with manual ISO adjustments, macro, etc.  Image quality is great especially for a 6.3 megapixel camera, but as most people know its not the megapixel count thats important as opposed to the quality of the imaging sensor.Video quality is so-so but its good enough in a pinch.  Unlike some of the newer versions of this camera that were released this has a microphone and speaker built into it.If and when this camera ever dies, no doubt my next camera will also be a Fuji.  This one was certainly built to last.", "Date": "May 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fuji A600 great camera!", "Author": "L. P.

There is one thing that is kinda goofy on it.  I don't especially like the battery compartment.  It is very hard to get the batteries in correctly and get the lid shut.  Also, seems like this camera uses up the batteries really fast.  Pictures turn out really nice and clear, color is very good too.  Overall, I would say it is a good little camera for the price.

She knows nothing about electronics and never will, so I had to take all of her pictures. My first observation was that it didn't seem to start up as quickly as my camera. I was surprised to see that the images were just as good as on my camera (of course they both have the same number of megapixels). The video quality on this camera is horrible compared to the f10. This camera takes videos in something like 240 or 320 frames per second format. The f10, by comparison, takes up to 640 fps...awesome video! The real clincher for me on this camera is the body. Sure, this is more of an aesthetic aspect that doesn't affect picture quality but this camera's flimsy plastic body won't appeal to many buyers. For the price, though, this camera is alright. I would rather pay twice as much, though, for something with better video and a metal casing.", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "FINE600", "Author": "Margaret Klim \"milkman\"", "ReviewID": "R38L47KNFL3LMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Satisfied.
