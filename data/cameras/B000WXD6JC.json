I bought two of these at $64.99, and in retrospect it was a great value.The picture is very clear, and the color quality is quite good.  This is a wide angle camera, and two of them cover my entire front yard completely (about 40 feet deep by 75 feet wide).  Detail is sacrificed a bit for the wide angle, but the 540 line resolution helps make up for that.They are nice and low-profile, unobtrusive, but noticeable to someone who would be looking for them.  The mounting system is a little challenging to get aimed properly, but once you have it locked down, it is there to stay!One negative, the beamwidth of the IR illumination does not cover the entire view of the cam, so you end up with a bright circle in the middle of the image when in nightvision mode.  In my application I think supplemental IR illumination will be necessary.Other than that, I can highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Some things to be aware of!", "Author": "N. Call \"Nexus D\"", "ReviewID": "R12PP6BEEBMEN1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "These units did not ship with a power supply or cabling!!! This is a big deal when you get above 4 cameras. It adds considerable expense to hunt down your own power supplies plus cabling times X cameras. I have previously purchased the big brother to this model, they were about 89 a piece and they were much beefier, had more IR's for night vision, and came with the audio microphone, power supply, AND 60 feet of cable. While these cameras are nice, especially as a replacement for an existing camera (that already has power supply and cabling), your best value for your money comes from the next model up.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Its just OK but...", "Author": "T. Foss \"Tonic\"", "ReviewID": "R1BAPRMQ6ETNB5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a personal system set up at my residence with four different cameras. I had an extra input on my DVR so I figured I would try this camera. It is built well and is made out of cast aluminum which I was surprised to see for the price. The colors are just OK for this type of camera. Better then most cheap cameras but just OK. I haven't found a camera yet that has lifelike color like my camcorder. Its due too resolution and electronics of course. My most expensive cam is $240 and my cheapest is this one. Night vision and resolution is what my goal has been when looking for the right camera. I have tried and own several high end sony super hads which are more effective for night vision (in my opinion). This camera has about a 20'x10' EFFECTIVE range(you can actually see and make out objects). I am actually watching this cam at night while I write this review and have a raccoon at about 10'. I can tell its a coon but cant tell the stripes due to resolution. This isn't actually too bad but you get what you pay for...At least that is what I have found with SOME cameras. While I will probably still use this cam for something, it probably wont be one of my cams on my DVR for long, due to the led strength. I will try to post a video review or pictures showing this cam and my others so you can see the difference.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "Arcanumy", "ReviewID": "R1L87VZVOKV7FH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is easy to install and works well.

They are wide angle, fixed focus.  My only issue is that the focus on them is fairly close to the camera.  anything beyond around ten feet is not in sharp focus.  You can see people and and things, but if you needed to provide a clear picture of a person at more than 10 feet, then this camera is not for you.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's Ok, thats about it.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R95OM8IUMMHDG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I install security camera's for a living and was in a bind needing to pick up a couple of these quick.For the price they are not really that bad. They got me out of a bind with the customer till I could get a quality replacement.They are about the poorest quality picture of any 600 TVL They are more the quality of a 400 TVL,, and what makes no sense is the camera has a wide view but the night vision light is a focused spot of light in the middle of your field of view. It should spread onto your entire field of view.Now if I did not install professionally I am sure this camera would have been satisfactory to me. But as much camera equipment as I deal with I feel this one falls short of a quality picture and night vision.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "best I have bought so far", "Author": "A. Mandeville \"Somanytools\"", "ReviewID": "R1F7L3V4PUUD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been running 480's and then had a failure, so I upgraded to a 540 lines and 1/3 sony with wider angle lens.  That was a lg branded cam from another source and I liked the result but hated the install.  Seems the brackets on them just are poorly made and the knobs strip, or worse they snap off. I liked the housing mount on these so I thought I would try them.  It was a good choice.  The housing mount is excellent, and holds it aim even in high winds.  The picture is better than my other lg branded 540 1/3 and the night vision is really clear.  The other reviewer noted a brightness circle on these and there is some edge detail lost on these on really wide shots starting @ about 35 feet.  But interestingly this is better than any other camera I have for night vision. There is some edge shadow but the alternative is wash out like I have on 2 of my other three brands. (The center washes out and the edge is clear, with these the center is perfect and the edge is shadowed)All in all I like the price, quality and easy of set up here. Best of all the housing maintaining its aim and not needing bracket \"adjustments\" all the time.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wrong power adapter", "Author": "Steve G", "ReviewID": "R3RHSXSTG0L8EJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well after receiving the wrong power adapter with my camera, VideoSecu Day Night Vision CCTV Home Security Camera 1/3\" SONY CCD Outdoor Vandal Proof, I called the supplier and it took about a week to get the correct power adapter, not bad. The cameras seem to do a decent job with video and although it's not hi resolution, you can still make out distinctive characteristics but not sharp enough to read the license plate of a car. Night vision is pretty good to about 30' with my camera with 26IR LEDS. System works pretty good with the CIB 500GB DVR, I need to see if I can adjust the sensitivity because bugs, flying in front of camera, can trigger the system to record, even shadows of the birds flying through detection zone will cause recordings. Anyways, I like that I can come home and click through the recordings pretty quickly and see what's been going on around my place, takes about 15 minutes to see what recorded over the last 24hrs, just make sure your detection zones aren't too big.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Deep in the heart of Texas", "Author": "Smartshopper1233", "ReviewID": "RYCO081F5LS1K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent camera...period.

This camera also has a wider point of view which is good for more coverage.  For the price, buy it....you will be happy with it.
