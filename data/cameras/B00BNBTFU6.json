{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera for the price!", "Author": "J A M", "ReviewID": "R3W4TMYAQFTLH7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this camera and do recommend it. Pros: Takes amazing zoom photos, (that far away butterfly becomes a close up beauty!) The ability to start recording at the touch of a button (you had to turn a dial on my old camera which doesn't sound like a big deal but on this camera it's so much easier to catch the unexpected moments) Cons: the zoom makes this camera not compact enough to throw in your purse, it's awkward to carry around on the neck strap if you are leaning over to play or walk with a toddler because the camera is so heavy it swings around and bumps the toddler's head if you're not holding it with your other hand, the color pop feature, especially on the black and white photo setting is really cool so far the color options don't really match up to most of what I see in my every day life, I've only had luck with one of the yellow and one of the blue shades, the rechargeable battery pack doesn't indicate when the batteries are done charging. Overall a nice camera!", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera!", "Author": "Anthony Furfari", "ReviewID": "R11RXSC15N3GQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so excited about this Camera, and the price I paid for the Camera and all the accessories.The Camera is Beautiful, Easy to Use, and delivers Great Pictures.The Shipping was super fast, and the product was packaged great.Only negative I would give is on the Accessories.
