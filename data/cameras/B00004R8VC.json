My criteria were picture quality, advanced features and a price under $500. After a week of  taking over a hundred pictures, I'm very impressed with both the crisp  quality and true to life colors of each picture. It automatically adjusts  to florescent, incandescent, and outdoor light. The selectable ISO settings  makes for very impressive low light pictures. The panorama stitching was  easy to use and very accurate. This will be great for taking seascapes  while on vacation. I'm still on my first set of batteries so battery life  is great. I read a lot of reviews on the D450 ZOOM before I purchased the  D460 and all the small things that owners complained about were fixed.  Olympus really must listen to customer feedback. The menus are easy to use,  it remembers settings when turned off, they even ship three manuals in each  language instead of one in three languages. I recommend picking up a USB  port SmartReader or Floppy adapter. Also get some NiMH batteries and a  charger. You're in for some great pictures with this camera.", "Date": "April 18, 2000"}, {"Title": "Low price for the high quality, let me give a quality review", "Author": "James E. Dimitroff", "ReviewID": "R1993SG822IGIH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera for about a month now.  I did extensive research on the internet for digital cameras $500 and under. The runners where Olympus 360L, Kodak 210, and Olympus D460Z.  And it is a very impressive camera overall.  The camera itself offers wide angle or zoom 3x shots.  It also offers a 3x cropping to bring it to 6x.  It's menu is very easy to use out of the box.  Has 2 menu modes, one with camera active, one when it's not active (setup mode.) It's auto focus is by holding the button halfway down for a sec, then clicking.  It's wide/zoom is a small lever next to shutter button for easy access.  You can use it's LCD or to save on batteries it's normal view frame for taking shots.  The smartmedia card and batteries easily installs/uninstalls.  If offers what they call a Paranormal mode which takes multiple pictures on one frame.  It offers a sequence mode that lets you take 10 pictures back to back with for a series shot.  You will need to format your SmartMedia card if it's not from Olympus, but it's fast and easy to do.  My only gripes are when closing the lens cover, you have to be careful and let the lens retrack first, so you just close it a little, then the rest of the way after lens is back in.  The flash flips up, and seems a little clumsey there, but it works fine.  You will need to purchase more than just this camera when you buy it.  What it comes with is: 2 lithium batteries, a hand strape, an 8meg smart media card.  And what else you need would be: a carrying case (est $30), a bigger smart media card (I got a 64meg est $60), NiMH Batteries w/charger(they aren't cheap but worth it est $110), a smart media reader (est $40), and maybe the power adaptor (est $60).  With a 64meg card I get 36 shots in sqhq mode.  And with my NiMH batteries, after one month of use, I still haven't had to replace them.  Normal alkline recharables last maybe 30-40 shots, the NiMH last more like 300-400 shots.  I use the lithium that came with it for backup batteries and place them in my case with 8meg memory card.  A SmartMedia reader is a must for getting the pictures to your computer.  Otherwise you will have to use the serial connection to the camera and very slowly d/l the pics.  Which means you'd have to have a power adaptor because it would drain your batteries.  With a media reader, it's like using a zip drive, and see the MediaSmart card as another drive, and you just drag and drop your pics to your drive, fast, simple, and very slick.  If you choose to purchase this camera, you will be more than pleased that you did.  But be aware, you will need to make a few more purchases in accessories to truely enjoy this camera.", "Date": "September 29, 2000"}, {"Title": "The digital camera that made me take the plunge - finally", "Author": "Larry J. Clark", "ReviewID": "R3CGYYGL6BFLE0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm primarily a 35mm and subminiature photographer and was waiting until digital resolution and price met at a nice point.  The D-460 did it for  me.First, a couple of warnings: 1) Batteries - Although Amazon lists 4  AA alkalines as the power source, don't count on it.  The two included  Olympus lithium batteries (which are each the same size as a pair of AAs)  are a special high output chemistry.  You will be VERY unhappy if you take  the camera to an event and only have one set of alkalines.  Digital cameras  use a lot of juice, especially when you download and when you use the LCD  screen.  The consumer problem is that the Olympus batteries (CR-V3, or p/n  LB-01E) are VERY hard to find.  I've not seen any in camera or electronics  stores, although you can purchase them for $14 ea directly from Olympus --  and Olympus says you should be able to buy them from several internet  vendors, but the only one on their list that even showed the batteries was  B&H, and they didn't have any in stock (@ $10 ea.).  The next best  thing is use rechageable NiMh cells.  You can spend a hunk of money and buy  the Olympus cell/recharger set, or can hunt around electronics stores and  buy something for about half the price -- make sure you get AA cells in the  1400 to 1500 mAh range. 2)  Price - The normal street price for this camera  is now $399. 3)  Downloading Photos - Although you can use the included  serial cable, you'll also use a lot more batteries.  If you have a USB port  on your computer, you should consider getting getting a SmartMedia external  drive.  They're inexpensive and fast and easy to use.But to the good  stuff.  Side-by-side tests against my office's Sony Mavica's give the  Olympus the edge at the same 640 x 480 resolution.  When you go to the  higher 1280 x 960 resolution, I think you'll be pleased with the results.  The optical finder makes it much easier to take snapshots, especially in  bright sunlight, where LCD only cameras leave you wondering what you're  shooting at.  The 3:1 zoom ratio is comfortable, and you can do accurate  closeups using the LCD screen for a viewfinder.  If you go ahead and buy  the SmartMedia external drive, you should consider getting an additional  8MB (one comes with the camera) or 16MB card.I think that for many  applications, including some professional use, you will find this to be a  good performing camera at a good price.  (The only reason I gave it a  4-star rating is because of the so-so availability of the lithium  batteries, and the fact that it took a little more digging than expected to  figure out what was really going on with those things.)", "Date": "August 6, 2000"}, {"Title": "Better than I thought it would be", "Author": "Steven B. Lelinski", "ReviewID": "R2RRAUBKQBBKRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hesitant to make the jump to a digital camera.  I bought this baby, and boy am I glad I did.  The pictures are remarkable, even when printed 8x10 on my printer (nothing fancy, just an HP 712C.)  I get better detail on closeups than I do using my SLR camera.  Pictures turn out great even in very low light.  Plus, if you pick up a set of rechargable batteries, this guy is practially free to use.  No more spending dough on film or developing.  I highly recomend this camera for anyone looking to jump into digital pictures.  It's well worth the money and will save you a bundle.", "Date": "November 27, 2000"}, {"Title": "A Definite Winner-- BUY this camera!", "Author": "Baltic Books \"Vic\"", "ReviewID": "R21E3C7NTV7B0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading every review we could find, last year we ventured for the  first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R  digital camera. We were definitely not disappointed.  The D460 is this  year's model improving the 340-R by adding a 3x optical zoom in addition to  the 2x digital zoom. For the price you will not match the features and  quality of this camera.After just a few days the camera accompanied us  to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while we nervously left our  Canon SLR at home. The camera performed marvelously. We found the optional  16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our needs, as we easily  downloaded photos each day into our laptop. An 8MB card comes  standard.We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light  settings. We took shots at our conference including a multimedia  presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was  readable! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian  \"ger\" (tent), we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky--  even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable!Arriving home we were  completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting  when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper. I  doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the  prints and a standard developed snapshot. The enclosed Olympus and Adobe  software is easy to use and functional for most home use. You will  absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and  panorama shots!One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating  was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one. If you  frame... say, a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will  discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area. Olympus should  do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that,  you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop  around for the best price. Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for  the flash memory card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the  flash memory card, slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into  any computer. You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all  around your table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do  you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs? You can  purchase up to a 32MB smart media card which will give you more than 400  shots at 800x600!", "Date": "September 5, 2000"}, {"Title": "The Olympus 460 is a good point and shoot camera.", "Author": "podavis", "ReviewID": "R30DOK9RY5YBXC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the 460 because I wanted a digital camera that I could stick in my pocket but one that I could also expect to take respectable pictures.  On the first count, with the built in lense shield, the camera is easy to  'bring along'.My expectations have been generally exceeded on the second  count. The camera was purchased in time to document a fantastic mixture of  daffodils at their peak.  The camera's macro mode produces stunning  pictures, the detail and contrast of a bloom that fills the frame is  beautiful.  My guess was and is that the apparent price premium for this  camera goes towards premium optics that only a company like Olympus knows  how to engineer.Color rendition is equally impressive, only flesh tones  under flash seem to be a bit off, and fortunately in the warm direction.  Otherwise, my expectations have been exceeded, it's comparable to 35mm  negative film. And I haven't noticed any significant distortions  either.My comparison shopping indicated that the flashes of all cameras  in this range have a 13 foot range.  I was hoping that the capability to  quadruple the effective ISO to 500 would extend the usable range to 26  feet.  So far, after 250 pictures, I have found the noise in a picture  taken at ISO 500 renders low quality pictures.  I haven't experimented much  with ISO 250.The camera seems to be slow to focus, or I'm too impatient,  one must wait for the green light in the view finder to confirm focus has  been found or fuzzy pictures result.  But this is no SLR, it's a point and  shoot concept and one that, given good lighting, takes fantastic pictures.  I printed a still life on a Textronix Phaser wax printer at 8x10 and was  amazed that I got a frameable picture. I didn't expect this it at only  1.3Meg pixels!By the way, it runs just fine on AA NiMH batteries from  Target or Radio Shack.", "Date": "May 12, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great  Camera!", "Author": "Ladyduluc \"Ladyduluc\"", "ReviewID": "R11MLBWDC4MD9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before I bought this camera and had it narrowed down to two.  I decide on this one because I had owned the similarly styled 35 mm and loved it.I like the fact that there is no lens cap to loose,  but the lens is still protected.  I use it to take promo pictures of bands,  so the location can be a bit hostile (bars and nightclubs) and I wanted  something that I felt was at least somewhat protected.I was more than  thrilled when I uploaded my pictures to a site to have 35mm quality prints  made and found that I could get exceptional 8x10 pics from just the middle  setting of the quality choices. But even in the lowest setting the pictures  are great for website postings.I bought a 16mg card to go with it and I  got 3 complete shows worth of pictures and with the Flashpath adapter, the  websites are getting updated faster than ever.I also bought 2 sets of  rechargeable batteries and have found that I can get a whole weekend of  shows (12-15 hours)on them even using the LCD panel and it's still cheaper  than buying disposable.", "Date": "May 31, 2000"}, {"Title": "Olympus D460 is the camera with the whole package!", "Author": "\"griega\"", "ReviewID": "R26WEHPSV9KGHW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market for the Sony Cybershot DSC 30. I really liked the way that the camera looked and was anxious to have one. Then I did a little research. I found out that Sony has there cameras made by an outside manufacturer. sony also does not share their technology with other manufacturers so if you want to accesorize, then you have to pay the inflated prices for \"genuine Sony parts\". Olympus has been in the camera biz for years. So I asked myself why am I going to buy a product from a company that doesn't really specialize in cameras? It is also good to know that there is only one kind of storage media that you can use with the Sony Cybershots. Conviently, Sony has also jacked the price on there \"Memory Sticks\" because it's the only thing that you can buy for it. The Olympus D460 does every thing that the Cybershot does, save for the swivel LCD display. The Olympus also uses smart card media, so you can be a little more selective in what can fit your budget. Speaking of budgets, I saved about $120.00, and still feel that I got a better camera that what Sony could ever offer.

I originally was going to buy the 360, but I figured if I was going to spend the money for a digital camera, I might as well get the zoom.With the 460 comes some advanced photography features like spot metering, fill-in flash, etc.  Those features may seem useless to amateur photographers, but if you take  the time to learn the features, you'll end up with better pictures.  The  TV wire is pretty cool, and even the pictures with the lowest quality look  pretty good on TV.  The LCD screen on the camera is very sharp and has  amazing color.  I just wish there was some way to cover the screen to  protect it better.  A downside to the Olympus is that it doesn't come  with a lot of accessories.

My first was the D360, which was a great camera until a child put the batteries in wrong and burned it up!  I cannot say enough good things about the D460Zoom...It writes the files quickly allowing follow-up shots in 2-3 seconds. It has easily understood controls, and takes better quality photos than most digital cameras I have seen -- including my brother's large and bulky Sony.  The autofocus and zoom both work without hitch and allow a considerable amount of leaway in composing your shots.  One of the things I find especially exciting is its ability to adopt to difficult lighting situations.  You can take pictures in very difficult bright and dark shadow conditions and get excellently exposed results.  I am comfortable taking pictures in any lighting situation, indoors or out.While there is some media that hold more pictures than the smart media cards, the smart media cards are very small and easy to use.

In the medium density \"HQ\" mode, each photo takes about 2-3 seconds to write to the SmartMedia memory card. This delay can be infuriating. When photographing evolving action, sometimes I take a photo too early - the action gets more interesting and I want to take another shot. But if it is within 2-3 seconds of taking a prior shot, the D460 can't help you. Press away at the shutter button all you want (even with the flash totally off). It is not listening.Frankly, most of the time this is not a problem. But this delay bother me so much that I went out and also bought the Olympus D490 Zoom, which is almost identical to the D460 but adds a RAM memory buffer. Delay between shots is almost zero. Shoot as fast as you want. Another advantage, having tested both of my cameras side-by-side, is that the D490 \"boots-up\" more quickly and therefore is ready to use just a fraction sooner. Instead of buying two cameras like me, maybe check out the D490 as well. Currently it is... more than the D460, and maybe worth it.Otherwise, the D460 has been a work-horse. I've shot about 1,000 images and surprisingly the TFT LCD display on the back of the camera has turned out to be quite scratch-resistant. After 6 months and a trip to Italy, it looks just as pristine as the LCD display on my new D490. Both fine cameras (though wish I owned only one).", "Date": "September 27, 2000"}, {"Title": "D-360 vs. D-460Z", "Author": "Robert Hastings", "ReviewID": "R24Y1E59YZWTOX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had occasion to buy the 360 and 460 recently. Other reviews adequately describe why both are great cameras and which accessories you'll need.  Essentially, they're the same box(1.3 MegaPixel) and microcode. The same  \"darkroom\" software, CamediaMaster 1.2, comes with both. The 460  has a better user interface and a zoom.  The buttons and menus are somewhat  more intuitive, but the 360 interface isn't bad to begin with.  The digital  2x zoom is the same on both, the close-up (macro) mode on the 360 is  4\", vs. 8\" on the 460.  The feature set (e.g.: ISO, spot  metering) is similar, if there're any differences they're minor and subtle.  The ease-of-use factor of the 360 is better.  On the 460, you have to wait  for the lens to come out of the casing, and you must remember to open the  flash.

Leyden", "ReviewID": "R3VF1SCCSW9PYV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Consideration #1 - Why did I choose the Olympus over other \"computer\" brands? Because the Olympus line of digital cameras in general beats out any other line of cameras out there as far as picture quality, and the D460 is no exception. It is always a rule of thumb to buy cameras from a real camera company, if only because the optics will always be top notch.  Once you have taken pictures with a computer brand camera, and seen the prints, then switched to an Olympus or Nikon etc... you will definitely see the difference in quality.Consideration #2 - Why did I choose the D460 over a Nikon?The main factors were price and battery life.  The Nikon cameras take to sucking your batteries dry given even moderate use of the LCD, whereas the 400 series of Olympus cameras are quite the road warriors when it comes to batteries.  Now remember that this camera does not come with rechargeable batteries (it includes high-powered NiMH one time use batts) you should plan on spending the extra $30-50 on a set of rechargeable and a charger.  Other Points of Consideration -Also plan on getting another smart media card if you are going to take more than a few pictures in one use, because the included card (8mb SmartMedia) only holds 16 SHQ quality pictures, (the format with the best compromise between space and quality) SHQ mode uses a JPEG compression to make file size smaller. Adding a 16MB smartmedia card will get you 32 pictures at that compression, and a 32mb card will get you 64 pictures, and so on...  Also remember that you can readily exchange between cards when one gets full, so you don't loose the functionality of that original 8mb card that comes with the camera if you get another one. You can just take it out when it's full and stick in your new one. (just keep them in their case, and don't loose the little things, because boy are they expensive!)Verdict -Overall, this a really a great buy and will serve you well while on vacation, or at your kid's soccer game.  If you want to make your pictures bigger than 8x10, however, you might want to upgrade to the D490.

I shopped around and got a good price on the D460 (less than $499) and am very, very happy. The  batteries have also lasted longer than I expected. I've taken pictures out  doors and indoors with and without flash. The flash has several settings,  much like a good SLR camera, but the camera can also adapt to low-light  without flash and keep the warm tones.A feature not often mentioned is  the fact that the camera includes a cable to hook it up to your TV and view  pictures at a large size, give a slide show to friends-- or even take  pictures while using the tv screen as a viewer. Surprisingly fun to do.I  followed another reviewer's recommendations and bought rechargeable AA NiMH  batteries and charger (the maha 1550s in a combo kit) at Thomas  Distributing for a good price. The Olympus tech support people told me just  to make sure you buy batteries with at least 1450 mAH--higher is better for  juicing those downloads. They do not recommend using any AC adapter other  than the olympus one because it might damage the camera (and I assume it  might violate your warranty), but other sources report that the one sold at  thomas distributing is fine. One more thing--if you buy another card, get  the Olympus brand if you intend to use the panorama feature--apparently  other cards don't support this.The only reason I give this camera 4 out  of 5 stars is that it doesn't connect to USB; the cable supports serial  ports and mac adb ports, but doesn't have a usb connection.

About 15 minutes after opening the box I already had a couple pictures taken and loaded onto my computer, this included software installation and everything!!  I love how you can see the pictures on the screen immediately after you take them, so you can see if they turned out or not.Just to address a few of the problems that I read in other reviews.  One person commented on how you get drained on the batteries.  The simple solution is to buy some rechargable NiMH batteries with a charger.  The NiMH batteries last a long time to start with anyways!!  Another problem that was addressed is that it can be tedious to find your pictures on the camera if you go through them one by one.  There is a setting on the camera so that you can put 9 thumbnails of the pictures on your screen at the same time, so finding your pictures really is not a problem!!I also recommend buying a USB Smartmedia Reader.  I believe I read that they are 80 times faster than using the connection provided with the camera.  Also, if you use the USB Smartmedia Reader, you do not need to waste the camera batteries while you load pics onto your computer, since the camera isn't even involved in the loading process if you use the USB Reader.Also, just as a side note, a 16 or 32 MB smartmedia card is nice if you plan on using the high quality settings.This really doesn't have to do with the camera, but if you plan on buying these extra add-ons, I really suggest using Ebay, you can get some great deals!!  I bought all the add-ons off from Ebay and spent about 100 dollars less than I would have elsewhere.To sum it all up, I think this camera is an excellent choice whether you have no idea how to use a digital camera (such as myself) or are a pro!  The controls are extremely easy to figure out with a tad of help from the instruction manual.  Also, for such a simple and easy to use camera, it takes excellent, clear, crisp, pictures, which really surprised me when I first saw them!  I highly recommend this camera!!The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is I think it should come standard with the USB reader, to save us consumers a little money.  Although not at all necessary, it still would be nice!!I hope this helps you all out on your digital camera purchase!!", "Date": "March 23, 2001"}, {"Title": "Accessories to get more from your D460", "Author": "wcc2", "ReviewID": "R3TA2D3S28I63B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having just picked up a D460 and really enjoying it, I was interested in how to shoot more and upload faster.

Simple. Easy to use. Treat it like a straight point and shoot and just click away.  The zoom feature lets you frame what you're looking at IN THE VIEWFINDER(almost like an SLR). The standard PnS green light-red light also tells you when everything's ready and then --bingo-- you've got another good picture.  The D460 also has some bells and whistles that advanced amateurs or even pros will like.  My favorite:  a white balance adjustment that lets you use the available light from fluorescents or incandescants. That's an important feature, because this camera is very sensitive in even low light, and it permits good, color balanced photos in marginal light.  My earlier digital camera experience was with a Sony Mavica MD90, a much more expensive camera.  Frankly that Sony can't hold a candle to the D460.  Accessories: I bought the SanDisk FlashPath (Floppy Disk Adapter) with the D460 to eliminate PC cable hookups.  This took some looking because many retailers are out of them.

The picture quality seems excellent and I was amazed at how vivid the colors turn out  with this camera. I have taken about a hundred pictures with the camera so  far and all but a few turned out excellent, and the ones that didn't were  my fault. One big advantage this camera has over my Casio is that the LCD  monitor has it's own power switch, so you can leave it off while taking  pictures and it saves on battery power.  There are several settings  such as ISO, white balance, etc that can be manually adjusted for better  picture quality or left on automatic if you rather not mess with them (like  myself).

In  the 1280x960 resolution mode, you can take 36 pics in High Quality mode  (default), 18 in Super High Quality, or 2 pics in Super High Quality-TIFF  (uncompressed).

There are a few things about the camera that I don't care for, such as  the main power switch. Instead of having an actual switch, you have to open  the lens barrier, which isn't a problem, however when you go to turn the  camera off, you have to close the lens barrier part way, then wait for the  lens to retract, then close the cover completely.

Sure, it's only 1.3 Megapixels and it might be a bit pricy for one considering you can get a 2.0 Megapixel camera cheaper but, the user friendliness and the sheer number of features make this camera far superior to the higher megapixel cheaper models.First off the pictures are crisp and clear and with the optical veiw finder available, you don't need to mess with the LCD screen and waste batteries.  The menu screen is easy to navigate (though a bit difficult to figure out the icons...) and this is truly where this camera shines.  Not only are you able to change the picture quality from standard 640 X 480 to uncompressed TIFFs, but you have to ability to adjust white balance, and more importantly, the ISO value!

The Olympus is generally \"right on\".  I also really like the software bundled with the Olympus.  I purchased a USB Smartmedia reader for the Fuji because I couldn't get the Fuji software to install under Windows 2000.  The Olympus software installed fine under Win2K and works really well.

A word of advice that I heard from a techie friend:  Go out and buy the NiMH rechargeable batteries and recharge those before you get your camera.

I never had a digital camera before and after doing a lot of research and reading reviews like these I settled on this camera.  It was  definitely the right choice.  Compared to some higher end cameras it was  very reasonably priced and worth the risk.  I didn't want to buy my first  digital camera for $800. The quality of the LCD is great so you can review  your pictures immediately and clearly.  The camera is so easy to use.  I  had it figured out for the most part before opening the instructions, but I  would definitely give those a look.  The zoom is good for the price of the  camera.  The best thing about this digital camera is that it is the size of  a regular camera.  There is no extra baggage.  It fits into a regular  camera case with no problems.Downloading the pictures is really easy.  I  did purchase a reader for the Smart Media Cards (which is basically the  film) which really quickens the downloading to computer process.  It was  only like $30.  I also got some rechargeable batteries, but I didn't even  need them until 8 days into my honeymoon.  The orginal batteries lasted a  long time and through a lot of exploring.I would suggest getting a  bigger Smart Media card than the one that comes with the camera (8mb).  I  got a 32 mb card which basically gives you close to 200 pictures in the  middle range of quality.For a non-professional who just wants to capture  moments of fun and wants the ease of downloading them to the computer and  then sending them to people, this camera is perfect.

I would have given it a 4-star rating then, but now it warrants only 3 stars from me. After 10 months of steady use, I can now point out its deficiencies:1. The lack of USB connection which makes it horribly slow to download pictures. It can take up to 10 minutes to download a full card! I had to buy a SM card reader to save time, which meant more $$ required.2. A very noticeable shutter lag, i.e. there is a delay of about .5 to .75 sec between the time you press the shutter release, and when the camera actually captures the shot. This camera is definitely not suitable for capturing \"the decisive moment\". If you've previously used an anolog SLR camera (like I did), this delay is unacceptable.3. There is also noticeable barrel distortion from the lens. Basically it means the lens makes people look fat and straight lines bulge outwards. To be fair, this is a fairly common problem in consumer digicams, and you can fix the problem with good photo-editing software. 4. The \"guillotine\" lens cover. It is quite easy to bash the lens when trying to close the retractable lens cover. You're supposed to slide the cover forward SLIGHTLY (but not touch the lens), wait for the lens to completely retract into the camera, then slide the cover completely shut. Whose bright idea was that?!Don't get me wrong though. This camera still serves me well (I work for a newspaper). The D-460 has many plus points which others have covered previously, so I won't repeat them.

Starting out, I thought wow, this camera has everything: zoom, autofocus, flash, memory cards, the whole bit.  But somethings i've noticed about it sometimes get me to worrying about it. First of all, everytime you open the screen, it takes about 3 or 4 seconds for the zoom lens to pop in and/or out.  This is bad because it wastes the batteries if you keep doing it for taking different pictures. Next, when taking the picture, you push the button, and it takes about 1 second for the shutter to actually flash.  I think this is because of all the focusing and dithering. Also, you can use the viewfinder to see pictures once you take them.  But to review them, you have to completely close the lens, wait the 3 or 4 seconds, and then hit a button to turn on the screen and wait for the picture to load.  This is not absolutely horrible, but sometimes I am in a hurry. Biggest thing:  While taking the biggest quality picture.. the camera will take like an entire minute to load the picture to the disk.  This is horrible because in a minute, the thing you may be shooting will be gone, or the group of people will become antzy. The serial port is so slow, its like having a really slow internet download.  On the plus side, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  It has 2 sizes, the larger size has 3 quality options, and the smaller has 3.  The higher quality ones look quite nice.  Very clear, very good lighting.  Everyone always complains because the pictures are so clear, you can see every blemish.

It's the only digital camera I've owned and I really enjoy it.  It's been on several vacations and numerous holidays with us and I seem to learn something new about it each time I use it. Once you read the manual several times and figure out the menus, you get the hang of what settings will provide the best shot.  The Auto setting will cover most normal conditions, but special settings are required to get shots of things that are moving or have unusual lighting.  It's easy to experiment and just dispose of the bad shots.  Battery life is good, but I strongly advise two sets of rechargables to always be prepared.  The download of pictures through the provided serial cable can be slow, but just relax and have a cup of coffee.

With no film to lose I can really make sure I like a picture by doing what the pro's do: take a lot of pictures and select the best ones.  I generally run the 460 at maximum resolution since it isn't particularly endowed in the pixel area.  The color rendition is excellent as well as the autoexposures.  Basically, if you can see it, it can photograph it.  Some of the night shots are quite impressive.The 3X optical zoom is good.  I wouldn't have a digital camera without it.  The lens is prone to \"barrel distortion\" where straight line things like poles and trees at the edges of the frame appear to bend toward the center.  A little strategic framing can make that less of a problem.  The camera is rather slow when trying to do live action shots.  It takes about a second between button press and shutter release.  This is an eternity when trying to photograph my son doing a bike trick or catching a hawk on the wing.  Being an old SLR hobbyist, I miss my telephoto and my filters.  I miss an instant shutter release and other areas of total control. In fact, we're shopping for a replacement for our old Canon AT-1.

It takes excellent pictures and is well-suited for producing photo-quality prints. It writes the pictures to memory at a decent speed, and has a rapid sequential mode at the lowest resolution. There is a slight delay for autofocus when you take the picture, but if you depress the button halfway while you're setting up the shot, pressing the button the rest of the way will take the picture instantly (much the same as in many autofocus 35mm cameras).Battery life with the included lithium batteries is excellent, but beware--they cost about [price]each (you need two). I have had a lot of success using rechargeable NiMH batteries; the battery life with NiMH is still decent, and it doesn't cost much more to get started with them than it does to buy a replacement lithium set.Picture quality leaves nothing to be desired. You even have the option of taking pictures in a lossless format (TIFF as opposed to JPEG). This is great for pictures that you need to enlarge. Note, though, that one or two uncompressed pictures can fill up the average-sized memory card. The special features work well and can be useful, although the default settings are good enough that the average point-and-shoot user will never need to change them. The lighting and macro features are particularly well-done; you can take close-up shots in macro mode that would typically require an SLR camera in the world of film.The camera's weakest point is in its serial link. It works fine, but you can spend a long time waiting for the pictures to transfer to your computer. It would be wise to figure the cost of a USB smartmedia reader into the total price for the camera--with my Lexar reader, the images transfer in a matter of seconds.I did a lot of research before buying this camera and can say that I was not in the least disappointed with the results.

I am crazy about this camera, and I have convinced at least three other people to buy it.The D-460Z is lightweight, comes with a flash, digital and optical zoom, and optical and LCD viewfinders.  I generally use the LCD viewfinder because it's convenient.  The camera will take low-light shots without the flash, which has been a nice transition from the 35mm film cameras I've had in the past.  The zoom is also a very nice feature that I didn't have on my film cameras.The camera uses SmartMedia storage cards, which can be bought at Wal-Mart and Target.  They're not very expensive.  The camera came with the 8mb SmartMedia card, which holds 36 images when the pictures are stored at the default size (about twice the size that I like to send in emails).  It also only comes with the serial port connector.  Many people feel that this is too slow, but I have no problems with it.  It probably takes 5-10 minutes to download 36 images from the camera.  You can purchase a SmartMedia card reader that connects via a USB port.  That is supposed to be faster, but I haven't found it necessary.I have bought a few extra components for the camera.  It does not come with a case, but it fits normal 35mm camera cases fine.  I bought a 32mb SmartMedia storage card (holds about 144 images in default size) as well as a four-pack of NiMH batteries and a recharger.  The camera came with batteries that lasted quite a long time, but when they went out, it was nice to have the rechargeables.  The rechargeable batteries will last me about a weekend of picture-taking before requiring a night in the recharger.  The camera will use regular AA batteries, but you will have to change them at least once a day.I have been very happy with this camera and I strongly urge others to purchase one as well.

Though I disliked the switchto the cheaper plastic housing with this model, the increased ease of use when navigating the menus more than makes up for it. Like the previous camera, you still get high-quality digital pictures with a number of features including red-eye removing flash, television display of pictures, 3x optical (lens) and 2x digital (computer) zoom, and a host of other features which make this camera one of the best in it's class. But since the earlier releases in this line, digital camera technology has increased while price has decreased (thanks in a large part to earlier models in this line, which took the market by storm). You can now get cameras with a higher level of megapixels and resolution for about the same price as the D-460Z such as Nikon's Coolpix 800 and the Kodak DC280. You should go to your local. . . consumer electronics store and look at ALL of your choices before deciding on which model to purchase (and then purchase it on-line because it is cheaper ;). Even though the D-460Z is no longer \"cutting edge,\" I still believe it has enough features and stunning quality to let it surpass many of the other choices in its class. Accessories: Expect to spend a few hundred dollars in additional accessories for this camera. I recommend at least 8 NiMH rechargable batteries for power (which you can buy on-line or at your local supermarket), a USB Smartmedia reader if your computer supports USB (this greatly decreases SLOW picture transfer times from the camera to the computer), and a \"soft\" protective case for the camera (the Olympus soft leather case is nice but over-priced unless you get it on sale). As well, 2 additional 32 meg or a 64 meg SmartMedia card is useful, and will allow you to take a vacation's worth of pictures without have to delete any (at least at the rate I take pictures). The camera lets you take a little more than 2x the SmartCard's megs in super-high quality, compressed images. You can buy these on-line at places like amazon.com... but the Olympus-brand accessories tend to go out of stock quickly.

I have an old HP color Deskjet printer, and the photos I print are good enough to put in my albums at 5x7\" size, 8x11\" pictures print kind of grainy- but I don't use the high resolution setting on the camera.The instruction manual is easy to navigate and simple to follow, I carry it with me on vacations to review how to take panoramic photos (these print beautifully!), or how to set the red-eye reduction.One word of caution, always use the wrist-strap when handling the camera.  I dropped my camera once on vacation, photos taken after that were too dark to see.  I sent the camera back for service to Olympus, and they were fantastic!  I had the camera returned within 3 weeks, and I could track the progress of my repair online at the Olympus website.

The battery polarity indicator diagram ,on the bottom of the camera, just doesn't match the polarity label on the included Olympus batteries (i.e. it looks like they load with polarity reversed..not a good thing). The manual has diagrams for loading individual AA batteries with polarity clearly indicated (which matches the diagram on the camera) but the diagram that illustrates loading the included battery packs has no polarity indicated!?!? The battery packs are 'Keyed' so you can only insert them one way. After arguing with myself over the conflicting info , I inserted the batteries, and the camera came up and works fine. Now I have to resolve this problem again when I use rechargeable individual NiMh batteries. Olympus really needs to rethink the instructions. I bet more than a few people have tried to use individual AA batteries , loaded them backwards and fried the camera. Tsk. Tsk. Major Oversight Olympus.

The cammera does it all, but when you want to control the exposure or the WB or even the sensitivity you'll have some problems. You can't DO a White Balance, instead you have some Pre asigned items to choose, and you just have 3 different sensitivities to choose. The other problem is that you can't control the focus or the diaphragm or the shutter speed.  My mother bought this camera in the US 1 year ago and I've been taking pictures of everything I see in the street. It haves a good image quality (maybe you'll see the lights a lil bit strange when checking your pictures) and even you can shot 166 pics with the worst quality (in an 8 mb card).  I discovered that when you connect it to the Videorecorder you can record what you are seeing. So if you have the old \"porta pack\" equipment you can use it even as a CAMCODER!

It needs 4 AA batteries and if you use the LCD they'll last 15 minutter or something.

I have been using this camera for nearly 5 months. The quality of prints I get are fantastic for a 1.2 megapixel camera. I am able to get prints up to 5x7 with good color tones if the correct setting is chosen. I like that the flash is manual (it doesn't automatically pop up when it detects there isn't enough light) because it gives me a little more control. I have never had a problem with the lens cover hitting the lens when closing it. The lens cover basically is a \"two click\" close; one to activate the lens to swivel down into the base and then the next to complete the closing of the cover. The only thing I would improve this camera with is for Olympus to add more accessories in the kit.

While the camera was in for repair we bought a refurbished olympus d460 as a backup since we had all the extras. We got 20 min's of use out of that camera when it went compleatly dead, so here we are with 2 camers both of which are in for repair.
