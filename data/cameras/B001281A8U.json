{"Reviews": [{"Title": "PERFECT CAMERA FOR ME!", "Author": "Robert A. Ross", "ReviewID": "R35A6BKCMBDV4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My see-point-shoot need of a camera didn't warrant any thing but a simple, small and cheap camera and this one seemed to fit the bill. Found it listed for under $100 from Amazon and bought it. Turns out it is MUCH better than what I thought I was buying. I think Amazon thinks it was much better than what it was selling, too, since they now have the price over $100 by quite a bit. Still a steal. I bought a 4GB retail memory chip and a couple spare batteries, plus a car charger. And, a small form fitting case. Now I can put it in my shirt pocket and just pull it out, shoot, and put it back in my pocket! No lens problem, no peeking through a hole problem. And no filling up the chip problem, even with movies.  Perfect camera. I am about to order another one and send it directly to my son, who can use it in his field work to document by movie his inspections of his petrocnemical plant and almost instantly create screen slides for his maintenance team members. Outstanding camera, for fun or work.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice small lens in body camera", "Author": "Bruce B. Hendrickson", "ReviewID": "R1K4ZUMRTWZ3WR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a lens in body camera that I could use motorcycling to pull in and out of a jacket pocket easily. I sometimes shoot while moving and don't want worry about the lens retracting to put back in pocket. For the Amazon price this camera is a steal. Well built and takes good pictures. 8MP is just enough to allow cropping and needed. I wish the USB style charge used a standard plug into the body so I would not have to carry a separate charger for it. No manufacturer seems to want to standardize. Controls are decent, but I wish there was a way to lock the mode wheel so it would be where you wanted when you pull it out of your pocket. Still give it 4 stars on price and performance.I don't use the MP3 features as I have a Creative ZEN, I might if I really wanted to travel light some time.", "Date": "January 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Camera was great...", "Author": "H.

Cooper", "ReviewID": "R2YH3PYX6ZU7WS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was reluctant to buy this camera for my niece as it is an old model (I think from 2007/8). She is thrilled with it! It also plays MP3 files (has a converter from the camera output to a regular headphone plug). You'll need to place the mp3 files into a file called MP3 for the camera to detect the files. Camera was only $40 new! I got a Squaretrade warranty from Amazon for only $6 for 2 years which includes accidental damage. The warranty is so cheap because of the low cost of this camera. Couldn't be happier with the purchase. If you have any questions, please leave a comment and I'll reply.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001281A8U"}}
