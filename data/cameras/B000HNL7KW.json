The unit will fit in any small shirt pocket and yet is rugged.There is no preview display but I still have fun with it!!  I Like-Love it!For $20+ (US Dollars) you can't go wrong.  I happen to have a spare 128 meg SDRAM card and the unit works great with it!I use Linux and could not use the enclosed software that comes on a 3 inch CD but Linux detected and open the Camera with no effort at all! Mandriva 2007 detected the USB Camera and automatically opened the Camera as a Flash Drive Folder would open!It's a toy but a lot of fun and it REALLY works and works well!  For the price, it's great!", "Date": "October 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Battery consumption is the problem", "Author": "C. Savery", "ReviewID": "R3CZ6XE3BE2LW4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is an interesting toy camera. I got it just to play around. It works and is fun but uses far too much battery power. You have to replace the battery practically every time you shoot a bunch of images. Maybe 50 shots or so and a dead battery. Really a shame as otherwise it would be fun and cute, kind of like a digital Lomo. I never use it now because I'm not going to waste so much on batteries.", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "cult pictures only found in much more expensive cameras", "Author": "Michelle M. Ress \"safoocat\"", "ReviewID": "R3HEZGVUS6LR4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera takes unique pictures people search far and wide for cameras  with this character of pictures and still don't find them. Lomo comes to mind.With the exception of the lousy battery life this is a winner. There are battery off mods found on the internet. I intend to build an external batterybox for mine. Use rechargeables and carry extras. Don't put the battery in until you are ready to shoot.update October 2013 I've just discovered the Eneloop batteries work better in the camera and NIMH batteries. Still adviseusing a battery off mod since the internal memory will run down the battery otherwise.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "1.3 MP Digital Camera", "Author": "John E.

It is essentially numerous misshapened pieces of plastic that neither fit appropriately or function in any way.  It is utterly worthless!I gratefully returned two of these cameras after opening them  at Christmas to the disappointment of my two children!Don't bother, move on to another product", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very expensive...when you get nothing", "Author": "J.

It is such a piece of junk that even though I purchased a memory card for it, and really, really tried no one could get the thing to work.  I have had several cameras of all types and this one shouldn't even be on the market.  This was money spent on something that eventually just ended up in the trash!", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "review of digital camera", "Author": "JT \"JT\"", "ReviewID": "RK2024HEOZ9HP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was a complete waste of money.
