This camera excels in rendering images with incredible sharpness, excellent exposure, and well balanced color saturation.  Dare I say this camera performs as well as the Digital Rebel!I found it rare to get an image out of focus with this camera.  The 5 MP gives me room to crop images without loosing detail.  I was able to figure out all major functions without even opening the manual.  The fast turn-on time, shutter to shot, and shot to shot performance took me by surprize...capture the moment and review it immediately!  There is some metal on the camera that adds ruggedness and gives it a \"well built\" feel.  The large bright LCD helps review image quality quickly as well as help compose without squinting.If you want an excellent point and shoot that gives you fast, sharp, reliable results, then the cx7530 is the perfect choice.Check out my \"customer images\" (link below the cx7530 image, above).Pros:1. multi-point focus always renders sharp foreground images; i found few images out of focus.2. shadows and dark areas are not grainy or noisy; this is helpful when you're cropping pics and enlarging them.3. very smooth transitions in bright area and never washed out; this helps you with contrast especially if you convert to black and white later4. very fast; press the shutter button and you don't miss the moment!5. very quick; shot to shot6. fast turn on; rotate the dial and it's almost ready before you are!7. huge LCD that's sharp, bright, and fast to update while panning8. battery miser; with NiH rechargeables, i was able to get 85 shots where 25 used the flash9. images get auto-rotated when taking a portrait10. very quiet; no focus or zoom noise11. LCD goes blank after a while of no use to conserve power12. 2 movie modes; QVGA (320x240 @ 20fps) and VGA (640x480 @ 13fps);Cons:1. does not remember setting if you change them after you turn off the camera; but i've rarely had to tweek something to get a great image2. 4 way navigation button is on the left and i'm a righty; so this is good for the lefty's; not really an issue, though!3. can not disable digital zoom; but zoom indicator clearly shows the crossover point between optical to digital zoom", "Date": "September 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "KODAK DOES IT AGAIN", "Author": "Tim Janson", "ReviewID": "R332JGBQA6S4U3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've stuck with kodak through all my digital camera purchases and this is my third one.  The ease of use and fun of Kodak is surpassed by no one and it's a great bargain to boot.  The CX7530 has a maximum resolution of 5 megapixels, for 2560 x 1920 pixel prints.  3X optical zoom and 5X digital zoom bring the action close up and personal.  The movie mode allows you to take videos at a speedy 24 frames per second.  Automatic picture rotation makes pictures taken vertically appear right side up on the camera, computer screen or television. There are Nine picture modes including night, close-up, landscape, black and white and sepia.  And of course there's red-eye reduction.  Quickly use the one-touch easy share button to download, print, or e-mail your pictures.how's the Quality?  how about fabulous...bright, vibrant colors, focused so that droplets of water hang perfectly focused in mid-air.  makes me feel like I am a professional photographer.

I have been using this camera alone and I love it.  It takes crisp pictures, and is very detailed.  I actually had a 8x10 show water dropplets that you would have never picked up on my Minolta. I even bought the easy share printer dock (its a must)  to print pictures at home.  This is great for quick prints. I even found it to print better than snap fish, and walmart photo centers.

This was my first venture into the realm of digital photography.  I read a great deal before deciding on this camera and I have no regrets whatsoever.  This camera is fantastic.  Let's just go with a list:Pros:- The pictures are absolutely OUTSTANDING especially considering this camera's price- This camera comes on almost instantly.- The battery life is great when using rechargables.  Another good thing about the batteries is that the camera takes standard AA's, so if you rechargables do run out at a bad time, you can always run and buy a pair of regular old alkaline AA's.- Although it's a minor feature, this camera actually takes half-way decent video and the sound is pretty good too.  Also, unlike other cameras, the length of your video is limited only by the size of your memory card.- The interface is very intuitive.  You hardly need to read the manual- Did I mention that the pictures were great?Con (very minor):- I wish this camera could go fully manual (changing the aperture and shutter speed).  However, you can usually trick the camera into doing what you want by changing the settings a little bit.Anyway, do your own research, but I think that you will find this camera to be an amazing value for the money.", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera", "Author": "Hani Salah \"Deepo\"", "ReviewID": "R2XAEXR10IET7E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Kodak CX7530 is indeed a wonderful camera. I took lovely pictures of just about everything that i pass by. It is easy, and fast. I have it with a 256MB memory, so storage is even not an issue.It just has two problems:1. You can't store the camera settings (except for the picture quality) - i.e. Your settings will always return to default whenever you change the shooting mode or power off the camera.2. By default, the shots will be kinda dark at the default level of light exposure (even with a flash) unless you are in real strong light.But the darkness issue is never a problem coz the camera comes with an awsome software that makes editing a picture just as easy as shooting them.I shot a picture that was real dark. When displayed on anything, its LCD or my computer all that you can see was a black background. I used the software to increase the light, and i totally got my picture back. It is lovely.It is good on power, it uses just AA battaries and if you've got them rechargable you can stay as long as you like.The camera would have rock even more if it has a stitching feature.", "Date": "November 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "5 Stars is not enough", "Author": "Stephen L.

This CX7530 is a fabulous camera.  You can just point and shoot or you can go into the menus and adjust the shutter speed and ISO and get some really creative shots.  I took mine to the Shedd Aquarium at night and put it on a tripod to capture the city (Chicago) from the lake.  I adjusted the shutter for a long exposure on 5 MP setting.  The resulting picture was breath taking.  We've had it professionally printed and it is now a wall mural.  It is that good.  Really sharp pictures even when laid down on very large paper stock.You can not go wrong with this camera, and I highly recommend the printer dock.

I finally decided on a Kodak after using my sister-in-law's older model.  After reviewing the different models, I decided that the CX7530 had the best bang for the buck, and shouldn't have me needing to buy a \"better\" camera for several years.  I have to give HUGE kudos to Kodak for absolute ease of use.  When we got this camera (yesterday) neither of us looked at the owner's manual.  We just started clicking away, using each of the settings.  Getting in and out of the menu, and picture review was so easy.  Uploading the pictures to the computer was also easy.  The software that came with the printer dock wouldn't install because of some conflict with XP.  But we have been using the Microsoft Camera Wizard which is basically idiot proof.  Our Dell computer has preloaded software, which we have been playing around with.  So far we have taken about 36 pictures, all in the \"best\" quality.  I am absolutely AMAZED at the crisp clarity of the photos this camera takes.  Scenery, pictures of people, animals, close ups of flowers, they are all amazing.  I think I am most impressed with the close up pictures.  I took a close up of a yellow dandelion, and the picture shows every detail in 3D.  I still can't get over the pictures!  We used Wal Marts online photo center to upload some of our picutres to see how they actually looked in print (they look STUNNING on the computer).  We got 2 4x6's, 4 5x7's, and 2 8x10's.  I was just as impressed with the prints.  The same colors, depth, and clarity was present.  We also used the movie mode to take a quick 30 second movie, using the internal memory.  The sound was good, and the picture better than I expected.  Things were a bit jerky when moving, but once focused, it was good.  Very impressive over all!  So, for those of you doing the research, ready to make the plunge into the world of digital cameras, or even looking to upgrade, you really need to look at this camera.  The ease, number of features, price, and quality of the photos make this an unbeatable bargain.", "Date": "April 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very pleased!", "Author": "Hekate \"vjb3\"", "ReviewID": "R2CB8V3CWP2R13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second digital camera, and my second Kodak.  My first was the DC3400 dinosaur, and I was pretty pleased with that.  The DC3400 was limited compared to current technology, though, particularly in terms of resolution, size, and SPEED.  I was surprised how small this camera is, although it's not nearly as small as the super-compacts (which are a little too small for my taste, this one is about right).  I've heard complaints that the super small versions aren't very robust, but this medium-small version seems to be pretty durable.The camera is simple to operate, plug-n-plays nicely with XP, and seems to put out good pictures.  I particularly like the feature that allows you to take a series of stills rapidly by just holding down the shutter (very good for small children and animals that don't pose well!).With a 512M card, it has room for about 320 pictures at \"Best\" resolution.  Other features... cool sounds effects (plus the ability to TURN THEM OFF!), black and white, and sepia tone settings!  Very fun and will make great Xmas gifts (I hope).My only irritation so far... the navigation button is the 5 function on one button variety that can be hard to get to do what you want (the same type that has become common on cell phones, some PDAs, TV/DVD remotes, etc).  I'm sure it's an acquired skill, so I hope this won't be such an annoyance after a few uses.So far so good!

Peterson", "ReviewID": "R37ZE0VZY1H58I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a recent trip to the mountains for a weekend getaway,  I decided it was time to purchase a \"wearable\" digital camera. I wanted something small enough to carry in a belt pouch (like you carry a cell phone) so I could keep it with me all the time.Also on my list of \"wants\" were the requirements that it: run on standard batteries (I now refuse to purchase electronic devices that require $50+ proprietary batteries); must be reasonably priced; must interface to my computer via a cable utilizing a USB port/plug (didn't want to be forced to use a docking station); be easy to operate; and of course, needs to be able to produce a nice looking picture.I've owned several digital camera's (Canon and Sony) over the past 6 or 7 years, so I've had some experience with both the good and bad aspects of digital photography.  After a fair amount of research (with an admitted bias toward Japanese name brands), I settled on the Kodak CX7530.  And I have been impressed.The photos are absolutely stunning.  The color saturation and clarity will amaze you.  I have yet to take the instruction manual out of the plastic wrap, yet I have managed to figure-out how to use most of the camera's features with just a little trial and error in a single afternoon.  Runs on 2 standard \"AA\" penlight batteries.  Sports more than average internal memory with the option of adding more storage capacity via removable cards (I purchased a 512MB SD card for about $40).  Computer software installation can be a bit aggravating, but once completed, picture transfers were simple, fast, and flawless.  And you can even shoot video clips that offer pretty credible quality.

However, my experience was very different and disappointing compared to others.  I am a professional graphic designer and have experience with professional photography as well. I wanted a good inexpensive digital camera that would exceed the quality and resolution of my $800 4 megapixal digital camera.  I purchased the Kodak EasyShare CX7530, so I would have it before my sister's wedding.  I tested it around the house for a couple of days and made the following observation.  Photos that were taken outside in natural sunlight turned out absolutely perfect.  I could see extremely detailed aspects of my photo subjects that could not be seen when taken with a 4mp camera. I took pictures of my dog and could literally see every single strand of hair on her in all the photos.  Outside photos are absolutely amazing. HOWEVER, the photos I took indoors (using lighting from lamps and/or overhead lights) did not turn out as well. The overall color of my photo subjects seems to be rather subdued and the color was not accurate.  The details that I saw in outdoor photos weren't as prominate when the same subjects were photographed indoors.  Nevertheless, I still felt that it had potential, and I took it to my sister's wedding anyway.I took approximately 90 photos at the wedding, and nothing could have prepared me for how terrible the photos would turn out. The chapel had natural sunlight coming through the windows providing enough lighting so that the flash was not automatically used. All of the photos were taken using the \"Auto\" setting. I was sitting in the front row so I wouldn't be too far away from my subjects. While the photos appeared to be normal through the viewer window, I was shocked when I got home and transferred them to my computer.  Every single photograph taken in the chapel was absolutely ruined.  They all had a bright red tint to them that could not be corrected, and they were all severely distorted and blurred.  I only used the zoom in a couple of photos, and those photos were completely unrecognizable.  But the majority of photos were taken without zoom, in good lighting, close to my photo subjects..... and none of them are usable and worthy of being printed. The ONLY photos that turned out decent were the few I took outdoors during the wedding reception, which was held at 3pm sunlight and in perfect weather. I am shocked, disappointed, and angry.... words can't describe how I felt when this happened.  How can a camera that takes such perfect photos outside in the daytime take such horrific photos indoors?  I will never be able to replace the memories or photos I took that day, and I think everyone should be aware of the potential downside of this camera.  It definitely doesn't deserve a perfect rating.  I am a professional, and if I received such terrible results from a camera, I would caution anybody else who is looking for a dependable, easy point and click camera.  I returned this camera the second I got home from the wedding.As a side note, my aunt has the Kodak EasyShare DX7630 6.1 megapixal camera, which isn't much more expensive than this 5MP camera.  Almost all of her photos came out perfect and the detail is absolutely amazing indoors and outdoors.

As in, a shot I took of a sunset above a shopping mall I was in has been my wallpaper for the last month or so. Outdoor photos on auto setting look fine... except shots with a lot of glare in them (for example, ocean shots), which throws off every one of the auto-sensing settings.

I really can not fault anything about the the camera.  I won't echo everything so many others have said about this fine camera surfice to say I agree fully with what was said.I draw one distinction however.  I gave this Camera four stars not five because the len's cap looks and functions as if it was designed by a two year old.  The Len's cap for this in all other ways superior camera is a abject disgrace to anything approaching quality engineering.  The Len's cover has less thought in its design than the lens cover you would find on the cheapest disposable 7 dollar box 35 mm camera's.For such an expensive camera the len's cap is just plain unforgivably cheap, not well secured to the camera body.  Even when properly affixed the connection between len's cap and camera body is almost non-existant.  The Len's cover pops off at the most inconvenient times and my being physically disabled it is a real dangerous chore for me to get safely on the floor to retrive it.I am happy Kodak came out with such a high grade camera.  I would not let the cheaply designed len's cap issue I raise here cheat you of the opportunity of owning this extremely fine camera.  I write about the flawed lens cap issue in hope the next digital camera Kodak produces invest's the same care to building a len's cap worth the awesome camera it protects.Thanks.

The image quality is good, and you can change the size of your pictures very easily in a very undestandable way (small, med, large)... many people don't understand what pixels are (I sure didn't before!).The internal memory is also great!  You can take pictures on those moments when you realize you forgot your memory card at home!! (I hate when that happens!)  The black and white pictures look awesome and the sepia mode makes a very beautiful brown shade.  The video mode is good and the built in speaker is awesome for watching your videos right there.There is one complaint I have about this camera.  Sometimes indoors, the flash isn't very good.  The backgrounds come out very dark.  But with some editing on the computer, you should be able to fix that!But the most incredible thing about this camera is it's durability. Man, has my camera gone through alot!  It's been thrown 15 feet in the air, left outside on a rainy night, dropped in the toilet, dropped in the sand at the beach, dropped really hard by little kids... it's just been abused in any way you can think.  And amazingly... it still works.  Don't ask me how, but it does!  I've never repaired it or anything.

Noticed the ratings, and had to jump in for a few words.I bought this about 1 1/2 yrs ago to take pics for work, both indoors and out.  Used about 5-10 times / month, 20-200 pics per mo.  The pics I've gotten with its \"pipsqueak\" 5MP have produced the best photos so far from among my co-workers cameras, some as high as 8MP (and they all agree, unanimously).  Very bright pics outdoors, good indoors as long as you are within flash range (perhaps 10'-12' max where its real dark).Granted it is moderately \"bulky\" compared to the newer super-compacts and is a bit of a squeeze fitted into your typical shirt pocket, but at the current price ($150 or so I see, as of 1/12/07) its a \"fair\" price and ideal for someone who wants a quality semi-bargain snap and shoot that is relatively easy to learn, even now.  Just know that I've only used it for 4x6's (with an HP 375 battery-powered mini-printer in the field) and a few 8x10's.It is a tad slow to power up, and getting the red \"not ready\" (mostly because of flash settings I've messed with) light to stop takes a moment of patience.  This is all that is even slightly negative that I can say about it.  The controls aren't cumbersome, the menus are good (not great, but good for what it does), the battery lasts a long time (and ,nicely, will take AA's in a pinch, its most endearing feature for me at work where I may not have a charger, although I may only get another 20-30 pics with flash from standard AA's), and since its pictbridge compatible I just plug it into the printer or computer and go, everytime.It has done all I've asked of it, and have certainly got my money's worth (I recall I paid about $200-225 or so).  If you aren't going to go and spend $225 & up within the next year for another camera (say a Canon SD600 or 630 or comparable, at that price range, both of which are smaller and take good pics), this is all you'll need.", "Date": "January 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good picture if you know how to use it.", "Author": "Disgruntle buyer \"whizstudent\"", "ReviewID": "R1030O4TH8PSVI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Kodak is my second digital camera, my first was Sony 3.2 MP..

I've already get the hang of this but occassionally I got blur pictures and this is very frustrating. Furthermore, if you gonna ask someone to take your pictures, you have to explain to them how to go about doing it so that they won't take blur pictures.
