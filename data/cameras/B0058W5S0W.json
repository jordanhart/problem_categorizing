However I do believe that some new HD cameras can still spit out Standard Def so this product still  has some life in it still.  I like the D1 capability...easy menu etc... a well made and backed up product... Swann has been doing this for a long time and  you want someone with experience and a warranty centre of some kind.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "Sharke", "ReviewID": "R1ABXEV6FLVHWR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old Swann DVR died and I need just the DVR so I could still use the existing cameras. This one hooked up perfectly and was working in less than 15 min. I downloaded the android mobile phone app and it works just fine. Best of all for $10. shipping Amazon had it at my house the next day!!", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm experienced, but found the setup easy and it's worked reliably for many months...", "Author": "Frank J.

Easy to use however we do not use the Smartphone View portion of the product so I cannot say if that is as easy as setup and use.
