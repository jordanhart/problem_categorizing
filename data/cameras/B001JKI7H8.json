Second the 18 gauge wire is a must for any application that exceeds 60ft.Third if your going to go for the good cable don't go cheep with screw on BNC connectors. buy a good crimping tool and connectors. finely i won't do a security cameraproject with anything else. it just helps eliminates potential problems.

Although it mentioned the center conductor is bare copper, which it is, but right next to it says 95% shield braiding making the reader thinks it's pure copper also. This cable is good if you run STANDARD DEFINITION CCTV cameras or on short runs. But I am installing a HIGH DEFINITION SDI system with a couple of long runs, so I want the cleanest possible video signal transmission to get the best possible image. I know this is very picky, but then it's why I got the HD cameras in the first place.Aluminum has a higher DC resistance than copper so for long runs the electrical signal will degrade a little. CCTV cameras run on BASEBAND frequency (below 50 Mhz) so the types of material has more effect than HIGH frequency bandwidth like CATV. This is another reason why it's not recommended to use RG6 for CCTV. The undesirable effect is ghosting or trailing images. If there was a mention of CCA braiding I would have past this up and won't waste my time reordering another cable.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$294.95", "Features": "RG-59/U Type coax plus one pair 18 AWG stranded power cable.
