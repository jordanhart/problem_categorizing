It can give you great quality with MP3's, digital pictures, voice recorder, web cam, and tv pictures.  It's a little bit overwhelming at how all of these gadgets fit into a product that is about 2.5\" x 4\" x 1\".  My only critiques are that the pictures are in black & white, you have to have a computer or tv on hand to view the pictures, and you cannot choose the color of the DC-530 that is sent to you.  Besides these minor faults, it's a great gadget to have and will save you lots of space and hundreds of dollars if you were to buy all of these items separately.", "Date": "December 26, 2000"}, {"Title": "Love and Adoration in Italy.", "Author": "\"mikematera\"", "ReviewID": "R23PABNP440DI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the pretec 530 for my trip to Italy.  After reviewing the features I've decided that I absolutely adore this camera.  The pictures are 640x480 which is perfect for my online photo album, the color is excellent and the pictures are sharp.  One of my biggest reservations when buying the camera was wether or not I would be able to take good pictures in any conditions, indoor, outdoor, candid, etc.  So far I have been able to capture very good pictures in both low light and direct sunlight.  My only warning would be that the flash has a limited range (2 meters or so).  If you are using the camera in low light, be sure to get friendly with your subjects or they may come out somewhat blurry.  The camera is smaller than I pictured it, which is a real plus. Also, it's perfect for travelling.  I bought a 90Meg compact flash for it, which will hold over 1000 pictures (in high quality mode).  This is really handy for a vacation, because all I need to carry are spare batteries.  Also, the capacity makes it easy to sacrifice some room for music to listen to on the train.As a final note, I really like the driver software.  The other small usb camera I have (Creative WebCamGO es) has very elaborate software just to get pictures on and off of the camera.  Pretec's software is less flashy but more stable and way more useful in my opinion.  When you load the camera driver the contents of the camera open like a folder on your disk.  From the folder you can load, store, or delete pictures, audio files, and mp3s just like any other file.  This, in my opinion, relly beats having to go through some multistep process just to get the files onto a floppy or into your email.Great Camera... buy ten!/mike", "Date": "May 17, 2001"}, {"Title": "Suprisingly good multifunctional gadget for the price", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "RT4C6WDPWYIXY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I found this unit while looking for a combination webcam digital camera.  I had also desired to purchase a compact flash MP3 player.  Double bonus, and a audio recorder to boot, what a deal.. The pictures are suprisingly detailed and with accurate color reproduction, something I would expect in a higher echlon camera.  It is not a multi-megapixel unit, but can hold its own in its class.  Detail on images taken inches away lacks resolution, but anything taken with more than a foot has enough definition and will suprise you.  The USB connection transfers images quickly and the TV display connection is nice.  It does not have a LCD screen on the unit, but its price is enticing to say the least. The mp3 player works great.  Another bonus that both pictures and mp3 songs exist on the same memory card.  The camera creates a folder on the card for its images. Triple mega bonus, both the mp3 songs and jpeg pictures are immediately accessible on my Windows CE PDA!!!!  Unbelievable... My friend just spent $300 for a Sony mp3 player and an absorbant amount on a Sony maciva digital camera and is disappointed that the memory sticks are not readable by both and his files are not transferable to his PDA.If have the need for a digital camera, mp3 player and webcam look not further as this is the unit for your.  It will work great in capturing moments and memories while providing countless hours of music entertainment.If you are looking for a digital camera to produce high quality prints to display and frame, you will need a higher end mega pixel unit and some good digital imaging software.", "Date": "May 13, 2001"}, {"Title": "fancy functions, but poor quality", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2LLCANDRMTSZ2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It looks perfect at the first sight. And actually it works great when I use it brand new. Only the software is not so satisfying. It causes my computer to restart from time to time. But within a week, I find there are many problems with the camera itself. Almost 5 out of 10 times, I can not switch it on successfully. I have to disconnect it with the batteries first, only after that it's willing to work. Also, I can not transfer between the camera and my computer through the USB cable. There is always an error there. I contact their tech surpport but they are of little help. Anyway, I can still \"use\" it at long as I have a card reader. But recently (within 3 month of perchase) this thing refused to work completely. There is just no way to turn it on. Btw, I always take good care of it, never drop it or something like that. That's why I give it a single star. If it works as it says, not bad. But you have to take the risk that you get a \"bad\" one like mine.", "Date": "September 29, 2001"}, {"Title": "I'm sorry to say this but this product is not worth it.", "Author": "Rodrigo Daza", "ReviewID": "RHT7EY3XISBZ0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This product is just not worth the money. Its from an unknown company. The pictures are really bad. You cant take an unblurred picture unless the flash is on.

First of all, when I bought it, I needed to download the Windows ME driver (a fix not indicated anywhere in the literature) - then it worked fine.I used it regularly as an MP3 player at the gym.  Took it to Mexico with me on a vacation - it crashed.  Came home - it worked!  Go figure...One of the advantages of digital photography is being able to see you pictures immediately after you take them.  For this camera, you'd better have a computer close by as there is no viewer window.One day when I took the camera out to use it, I discovered the tiny plastic hinge on the battery compartment door had broken (this is not the type of damage that some unknown person could have done - it was in a protective bag, just sitting on a shelf).  I continued to use it holding the batteries in by hand when needed (ugh!).Now for the real disappointment - I purchased a new computer system using Windows XP, downloaded the driver from Pretec's site - no go.  Camera won't work.  Tried to contact tech support via the web - filled out their web form and - imagine this, when I hit \"send\" I got \"Page not found\" (after a couple of tries too).  So, refusing to give up, I called their headquarters.  The recording said they were open 9-5 Pacific time (oh well, it WAS only 8:54 Pacific - no point in getting there early I guess) and asked if I'd like to leave a message for tech support - I pushed the appropriate number and...GUESS WHAT?  It wouldn't take my message because THE TECH SUPPORT BOX WAS FULL!  I wonder why....This was a regrettable purchase.", "Date": "August 7, 2003"}, {"Title": "Not bad, but not great", "Author": "Concerned But Powerless \"loqutous\"", "ReviewID": "R14RT8S6UN1HM7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You can't really hold this camera in your hand and take a picture because it will turn out too blurry.  But if you place it on a tripod or flat surface it works allright.  People don't realize that for everyday pictures 640x480 is pretty sharp. There's a 20 second timer which is also great and the video out is convenient enough (there's no way to preview window on the camera).The MP3 player works well, and I have minimal complaints with the voice recording (what can you expect for [the price]).  It's poor sound quality and the mic is a pinhead sized hole on the camera.There were some problems using as an internet camera in NetMeeting where the picture started bleeding and there were artifacts in the display as if the update was too slow, but again in a pinch it's not terrible.All told I'm glad I got it.  I'll take a picture or two with it and play music on it while I commute or walk around.  I can't really speak about battery drainage either.  I'm trying to find an AC adapter for it.", "Date": "June 7, 2001"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS 4 in 1 MULTIMEDIA CAMERA", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1O3BDDBSJCBNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never come across an electronic equipment so versatile and so inexpensive at the same time.

Prior to that, I always listened to music in the form of cassette tapes, and taking pictures with a traditional film camera.  With the new MP3 technology and high quality, high resolution printers at very low prices, I was tempted to look for multiple digital devices such as a mp3 player, a digital camera, and a voice recorder.  These stuff are not cheap; the average price for each item is about $150, and you only get an entry level quality product.  I was delighted when I found the DC-530 by Pretec, a 4 in 1 multimedia device that takes pictures, records and plays MP3's, and also act as a voice recorder!!! What a bargain ... .  Let's dicuss the individual features of this little gadget.  This little aerospace, futuristic looking device looks a little like a camera, but it is hard to tell from its appearance that it could also record and playback voice and mp3's.  It takes beautiful pictures, at full color (I think the person who posted a previous review has some wrong settings on windows, I was able to see 640 x 480 resolution at 24bit colors), and has all the standard features a regular camera has.  The autoflash functions very appropriately, taking pictures with accurate exposure everytime.  The MP3 player feature is wonderful; the 16 bit quality sound is as good as a traditional CD, if not better.  Voice recording could be acheived with this device, and it makes my life a lot easier when I go to night classes and I am too tired to take notes; I simply record the lectures with the voice recorder.  This device uses one of the latest storage technology; the CompactFlash.  With a high capacity compactflash card, the possibility to this thing is almost endless, taking lots of pictures and recording hours of music on one little compactflash card.  The best thing is these cards are totally reusable; meaning that you would not need to constantly buy new films, new cassette tapes, or new recordable CD's.  Pretec is definitely heading to the right direction, combining different products into one, making it a lot more economical for people like me, who is constantly trying to follow the trend but also on a tight budget.", "Date": "February 1, 2001"}, {"Title": "nice!", "Author": "\"iverydumb\"", "ReviewID": "R30ZUM2ZN4EZ2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a teen, and I found this a great buy.
