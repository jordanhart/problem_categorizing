{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrible Product", "Author": "New England Reader", "ReviewID": "R13QK2HHT85WZV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my 6 year old daughter as a step up from her Fisher Price digital camera.  It was a step down.  Her Fisher Price camera takes much better quality photos.  The camera automatically takes photos without flash so indoor photos are always blurry.  If you enable the flash the photos are so overexposed that they are pure white.  Just a terrible waste of money!!", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "Joneta Wright", "ReviewID": "R2TAWB6ZSG23L1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I still can't get it to work, the cd contained was so poorly packed it arrived broken and I've called twice to get a new cd. they keep telling me it'll arrive \"next week\"  I'm not happy with this.", "Date": "August 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Slightly better than a disposable.", "Author": "A. Morales \"Mansilla\"", "ReviewID": "R31A1205YTT0NE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera itself is very cheap. The flash is near useless. There was no mention about type or size of SD card needed or any memory limitations. I had to buy a plain 2Gb SD card. A 4Gb SDHC card wouldn't work. The packaging states that only 1Gb max will work. Without a card a maximum of 2 photos at the highest resolution can be stored.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "junk", "Author": "LASH \"happy mommy\"", "ReviewID": "R23RCRTBWZB1WV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this for my mom who needed a simple camera instead of the disposeable ones. I opened it to get it all set up and the dial did not switch settings and it is overall a piece of crap.  Needless to say it is going back.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "J. Okuly", "ReviewID": "R9ZJZHFH0M099", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't believe this camera was so inexpensive. I bought my first one for my daughter for christmas thinking it was cheap and she would like it but once I got it and see how well it was made and the actual quality of the pictures it took, I got back online an ordered another one for my mom. They both love it. So this was a great buy for a beginner as well as a mom with  a little experience.
