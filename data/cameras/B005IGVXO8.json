First of all, the other reviewers are right about the placement of the flash mechanism.  This is one of the few times that I have had a Nikon camera where so obvious an error in design was made.  I have long fingers and you can learn over time, but it is difficult to hold the camera steady without overlapping the flash.  I didn't however let this feature detract from the other excellent features.  The quality of the pictures are exceptional indoors and out.  I have a Nikon D7000 and the S8200 camera compares favorably in a lot of ways. The mode dial offers choices not on previous Coolpix cameras.  The 14X optical zoom is a major improvement over previous cameras like the P300 and for a compact digital camera, the shutter speed is amazinging fast.  I like that this model is slightly thicker and a little heavier than my old S3000.  It feels better in my hand and I can hold it easier.  I will have no problem traveling with this camera when it is not practical to take my D7000.  I also like the design of the multi-selector putting functions like flash control, self-timer, macro and exposure adjustment convenient so I do not have to go into a menu to use these features. This camera is a little pricey, but if you put a premium on quality and flexibility versus the average compact digital camera, I would suggest you buy this camera. I don't think you will be disappointed.June 2012 Update:  One of the most impressive features of this camera is the quality of indoor shots it takes without a flash. Shots are bright, clear with no artificial light distortions that you see with other non-DSLR cameras. I now almost exclusively take low light shots without the flash unless it is outdoors at night with no additional lighting present. I recently attended an indoor graduation ceremony where flash would have been ineffective at the distance I was from the stage.  I was concerned that the shutter speed would be so slow without flash that would result in blurred images.  This wasn't the case.  Almost all of the shots were clear and lighting was exceptional.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "great camera, what up with the flash?", "Author": "db", "ReviewID": "R1OICSE8L0535F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my Nikon S8200 a few days ago.  It is wonderful; easy to use; fast; and did I say, fast.  The CMOS screen is better than my Nikon SLR.  Downloading the photos to my Nikon Capture NX2 software on my iMac 24\" screen results in photos that are nearly as stunning as my Nikon SLR.My only gripe is the flash.  Whoever decided to put the pop-up flash where it is either never uses a point-and-shoot camera or has little bitty toddler-sized hands.  The flash pops up out of the camera right where your left index finger rests.  The first time I used it and the flash was required, the flash never came out fully as my left index finger blocked it.  The photo was lost.Warning for critical photo shoots: if you are hoping to get your child's first step indoors where the flash will be required, be careful, you may loose the shot. You must practice a new way of holding your camera.Page 12 of the supplied manual shows an artist's drawing of the left and right hands properly holding the S8200 camera for flash operation.  What Nikon has shown is physically impossible with normal sized hands and fingers on the 4\" wide S8200.My solution modification: I added a small 3/4\" x 1/8\" felt strip to the top of the flash to give me a tactile-feel reminder of the problem.  This reminds me to reposition my fingers and thumbs before using flash photography.  Now I position my left index finger on the middle of the top of the camera with the left thumb on the middle of the bottom being sure to not block my view of the rear screen with my left hand.  Weird, but it can be done.Someone at Nikon surely thought that the flash on the S8200 was real cool.  No, it is not.  Do the felt strip mod and you will remember to reposition from the norm.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Like it a lot. Amazed so far.", "Author": "LittleReadBooks 'n' More \"LittleReadBooks 'n'...", "ReviewID": "RLX5LH5CEGTD8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got my S8200 tonight and am still battling a bad cold, so I didn't really have a chance to take photos other than inside my house (primarily of my dogs, bedroom, and small christmas tree.)  But I have to say, I'm pretty impressed.As always, I despise my newest camera and am typically *sure* I'm sending it back for its first 1/2 hour in my hands, until I've had time to get to know it and discover its nuances.  Same thing happened here, not surprisingly.  But now I really love it.I shoot with Nikon SLRs professionally, but I always carry a little 'snappy cam' as I call them, around with me, because you never know what you'll end up wanting or needing a photo of.  I have an 'old' (2006) Nikon S7C which is certainly small enough and easily portable, but the quality is really lacking, especially with video - which is the other reason I bought the s8200.  Full 1080p video is lovely.  Hardly any lens zoom noise or AF noise, which is quite different from the 'clickity click hummm' the S7C makes.I PONDERED long and hard over getting this or the P300.  While I love the idea of the P300s fast 1.8 lens, the P300s zoom range is around 24-100mm, whereas this camera's is 25-300mm, and I really need the zoom more than the fast lens.  Not to mention that once you zoom in, that fast lens slows down considerably, anyway.  And I don't plan to do a lot of night shots with any 'snappy' camera like this.There is another major difference between the two, and that is the S8200 is 16.1MP and the P300 is only 12MP. You will see the difference in enlargements, especially any over 8x10.I did a couple of test shots at the long end of the lens (I turned the defacto  crappy digital zoom off - which is a nice ability, by the way, so that means just the optical 300mm) and I am really wowed at how clear and sharp they came out.  The VR really works well (another thing the old SC7 does have, but that has been clearly improved.)As for all the other features, I believe they are the same on both models (the S8200 and the P300.)  The only difference lies with P300s ability to shoot in program mode, aperture priority, shutter priority, and manual mode.  You know what?  I've been doing this for a long time now, and I don't know a lot of pros who would want or need that much control in a 'snappy' camera.  I can't speak for all pros, but I know the reason many of us carry these is NOT to duplicate and downsize our SLRs, but for the same reason everyone else carries them: to take snapshots!  So if I wanted that much control, I'd just stick with my DSLRs.Took some video (which look great on the beautiful LCD) but haven't had a chance to see any of them on a TV yet.  I can't seem to get them converted so I can view them on Apple TV (iTunes keeps crashing during conversion - my netbook's fault I hope.)  I'll have to convert it on my studio's desktop PC.  The other option is direct plug-in, but I only have 1 HDMI input on my bedroom tv and don't feel like contorting myself to plug the camera in directly.  So I'll have to wait and upate my review about the quality of the video once I'm well enough.Things that I am surprised I like:* the black and white copy (not sure why it's called 'copy' - I will have to RTFM)  Update: I did RTFM, and it turns out it's for making copies of print materials.  Despite what it's intended use is, I liked the way some of the photos I took with is came out (that were not printed materials.)* the high-contrast monochrome,* the backlighting mode with the ability to choose 0, 1, 2, or 3 stops of HDR (it does the work of compositing in-camera, and you get one nicely-exposed HDR image.)  Would love an HDR button on all my cameras, actually, LOL.* the flash - this little thing throws out a lot of light.  I got excellent coverage on a Xmas tree ornament 10 feet away with the lens at 300mm.Things I don't like:* the cheap plasticky door for the HDMI/USB connection.  I prefer rubbery ones.  These don't make me feel like they'll last a lifetime.* the lack of a manual. Yeah, can't believe I'm crabbing about it since I don't read them much, but apparently, I miss them.  Thankfully, I have my PC handy.* the fact that you cannot push the flash back in once it's been used.  So let's say the first photo I take needs a flash but all the rest that follow do not.  Thanks to Nikon I'll still have the stupid flash popped up and in my way.  The only way to retract the flash is to turn off the camera and then turn the camera back on to start snapping again.  Stupid design.  I'm sure they'll fix it in some later model at which point my S8200 will appear on eBay.  LOL.* the fact that it doesn't come with any - ANY - carrying case.  Even the S7C did. (not that I ever used it.)If they remedied the above shortcomings, and if it had a tilt/swivel LCD for shooting at low/high angles, as well as the ability to shoot RAW for optional post-processing futzing*, it would be the perfect camera, IMO.*While I said I don't want to miniaturize my DSLRs in a snappy cam, I do want the option of post-processing any excellent photo that I may grab while snapping.  RAW is the best way to do that as the changes you make to the file are non-destructive...as opposed to JPEG.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "The point & shoot I was waiting for!", "Author": "Peggy H", "ReviewID": "RMTG1NYRK9UUC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research online, I chose this camera.  Which unfortunately for me, was only 2 weeks before my vacation to Spain.  I received my camera 1 week before my trip, which gave me no time to really practice with it beforehand.  So I downloaded the 228 page manual and took it with me!  Note to Nikon:  Print a book!  I would have paid more just to get it!  I am in love with this camera!  The low light performance is outstanding, as is the image stabilization and macro shooting.  I only used the video a couple of times, but the shooting is easy,and something I will use in the future.  I am a previous Nikon customer, so the controls were easy to figure out without having to study my manual.As a previous user had stated, the flash design is awkward.  It took a couple of days of using it before I stopped putting my finger on top of the flash.

Many times, it just refused to lock.I have an S8100 and the S8100's images are much cleaner even when viewed at 100% and the AF locks MUCH better even in low light (although in the S8100, there is an annoying delay after the AF lock which is very prevalent specially in low light)Other weird items:1. annoying pop-up flash that can't be pushed down manually, but can be disabled by turning flash off. problem is, to retract theflash, you need to turn off the camera2. unable to turn off image review3. loud beep for button presses. you can turn it off or on but nothing in between4. pet mode selection on dial? huh? night portrait should be more usefulgood stuff:1. the 25mm lens is nice, much better than the S8100 30mm wide.2. charging port is now on the side3. tripod socket is closer to the centerbottom line is IQ is worse compared to the 12MP S8100.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "MRB", "ReviewID": "R2KBYBL1F1ZV84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "How long did I agonize before picking a camera? A loooong time. I do this everytime. Read all the reviews, look at prices, finally give up and buy one. Well folks, I bought a Sony DSC-Tx7, and a Panasonic DMC-ZS7. Both, in my opinion were not worth the money. The zoom on the Sony..weak. Images in low light were pathetic and all had a yellow sheen that even photoshop would not fix. The daytime and landscape photos were excellent. The Panasonic was a better camera, but again low light photos were over or under exposed. The zoom is excellent. Scene modes were excellent. Enter the Nikon. Simply put: WOW. I dont know what the negative raters are seeing but I have a camera with a powerful zoom, AMAZING low light photos, equally good HD movie (although it is sensitive to low light, as all are) and reasonable shutter lag. Only annoyances: Why does the flash pop up and then can not be reduced without powering off? Seriously...no plugin charger???...how cheap.

I did some side by side shot comparisons and was amazed at the image quality of the Nikon.  Out- door shooting the Nikon blew the doors off the DSLR.  Indoors it was a close second and only then when magnifying the image 200% were the pixals more noticeable in the Nikon images. I've heard of people having focus issues with Nikons, but so far haven't seen that... shot recovery is very fast....update april 10 2012.After using the camera for 5 months i'm still very happy with this camera. the backlighting mode is great for indoor shots around windows and lights, and the night landscape mode makes still shots at night look as good as sunlight shots...my only issue so far is occasional white balance problems (too yellow or too blue)...they can be fixed in photoshop but i wish there was an adjustment...my DSLR has the same issue but there is an adjustment on it.

My last camera was stolen - a Canon Powershot SD780-IS point and shoot camera with rounded edges that fit nicely in my pocket.  I had always wanted more zoom, and also hopefully better low-light performance, like at concerts, and I was willing to sacrifice some of the small form-factor of the Canon to get it.So this time around I went with the Nikon S8200.  The Nikon is small enough to go in my front jeans pocket - it doesn't have a lot of protrusions and bumpy parts - it's near rectangle.  It does a great job in low lighting.  I dimmed the lights and turned the flash off and took some pics.  The shutter does something strange - it seems to activate (click) more, and there's a long hour-glass waiting symbol after a low-light picture.  But the results are outstanding - very true to the natural appearance of the room, and no blurriness.All the pictures were great and in focus.  Someone in their review had complained about the auto-focus not locking sometimes, but I found that that happened only in close-ups, and if I switched to macro mode, they became sharp again.  I found that between those two modes, I can cover almost any distance and still have the auto-focus work right.  I really like it so far.I agree with folks that it's annoying for the pop-up flash to to retract until you turn it off.  They should have added a latch that closes it when you press it down.  My work-around is to just turn off the flash and press the flash down into the camera body with my finger.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "fingers crossed", "Author": "dtodj", "ReviewID": "R36Y4D0EM4GK38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ordered the S8200 after reading the reviews about the S8100 hopefully Nikon has made the improvements especially \"lens error message\"zoom was increased screen is clear and bright. menu easy to navigate, flash has a tendency to pop up in moderate low light, I just set flash to off.

I even tried many at the stores. Previously I owned a Canon, and I liked it, but thought I'd look at the competition. I had it narrowed down to the Canon SX230 (disliked the feel and the widescreen), Sony HX7V, Nikon s9100 and Nikon s8200. I did not include the popular Panasonic in this category, simply because I do not like Panasonic cameras. I tested all but the Nikon S8200 at the store, just to see how it felt, speed etc. I liked the Nikon S9100 the best. Then I read their was a newer model, the Nikon S8200. I read about focus problems with the Nikon S9100, but figured the S8200 would have improved upon that. I decided to order it. Here is what I liked and did not like:LIKE:- It felt really good in the hands, especially for a small compact.- It shot pictures fairly quick (but sometimes it lagged, because of the auto focus problems)- Pretty good indoor photos- Zoom worked well, and was fairly quick- Photo quality of the pictures overall very goodDON'T LIKE:- Auto Focus constantly did not work, which was very frustrating, because often times I couldn't even take a picture.- The video was not so good with auto focus and zooming. The video would always be blurred when zooming and then slow to auto focus- The battery life was a bit low, plus it had to be charged in the camera (but I knew this already)In the end, I decided to return the Nikon S8200 camera, mainly because of the auto focus issues. It just would not lock on! It was so frustrating. I have since bought a Sony HX7V, which is great as of right now. The Sony has much better video and Panorama pictures. However, the Sony is slower than the Nikon S8200.

The 9100 advantage is: longer zoom 18X and the flash is manual release and push down.  The 8200 has 14X zoom and annoying auto pop up flash that can't be pushed down when you are done with the flash. The only way to push the flash down is to turn off the camera.  The only advantage sold me on the S8200 is the image stabilization better than the S9100.  We used the 8200 to take lots of night pictures with holiday lights and downtown skylight in the Night Landscape mode and auto scene select mode.  They came out great, very clear, no blur.  We use a Lexar class 6 SD card, which is the minimum speed recommended by Nikon.  The night pictures were taken at the highest resolution 16M and it took several seconds to save the image.  It's a long wait before you can take the next picture.  The day time pictures seem a bit over exposed and color is a bit washed out in auto mode.  Maybe we need to adjust the brightness and color manually with the dial.  The battery only last one day, about 150 - 200 pictures.  The battery meter \u00bd mark doesn't mean the batter is \u00bd full.  It's actually a lot less then \u00bd full.  For traveling, we definitely need to carry a back up battery.  All in all, we like the picture quality and ease of use.

It is located right where your left index finger normally rests on the top left surface of the camera and the flash pops up into your finger.  It's kind of annoying and makes me wonder why Nikon designed it that way.  Additionally, you can't push the flash back down manually. You must shut the camera off completely which automatically retracts the flash.  Then you have to turn the camera back on.  Weird!!

This little camera is PACKED FULL of features.We took it to the botanical gardens to see how the Macro mode would work and it was amazing.

I used it on a trip to London recently, and got outstanding photos of everything from the Christmas lights on Regent Street and family gatherings to gorgeous sunsets and incredible movies shot in a bar where my nephew was engaged in a boxing match. In every one of those examples the results far exceeded my expectations. Plus, the price can't be beat, either. I had considered one of the new compact changeable lens cameras at twice the price, but can't imagine having gotten better results than I did with the S8200. And it would have been bulkier than the Coolpix.Obviously, it helps to read the User Manual, which I certainly did. Not everything is intuitive, and I haven't mastered it all yet (for example, I found out the hard way that \"no flash\" is overridden when you choose the \"backlight\" setting: intuitive for most, but not at that moment for me. Oh, well...).Being so satisfied with what I have been able to do with this camera, I'm sure it will only get better (for use of the \"soft focus\" and other special effects, for instance). Tried the \"continuous\" stills mode for the fight, with good results, but haven't tried the panorama function yet. Didn't feel I needed to. The only people who might not like this camera are those who want to fiddle with their own f-stops, etc. to override the auto settings and do everything manually, or those who truly want just point-and-shoot and nothing else. But if you're the latter, you probably wouldn't be looking at this camera anyway (actually, your smartphone should handle all those kinds of photos). And even for those folks, you don't HAVE to do anything to get great results.

I had to train myself to place my left index finger at the center-top of the camera or my finger would prevent the flash from \"opening.\"  And to retract the flash the camera must be turned off.  With that said - it took just 1 day of \"shooting\" to train myself.I look forward to putting the camera to the test in very low-light conditions.I like this camera.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Broke after 4 months...", "Author": "CCC", "ReviewID": "R1W01Z2A9110XR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was pleased with the camera initially and thought it produced reliable, sharp pictures.However after about 4 months of use (a 3-4 school functions, and 1 Europe trip), the camera stopped being able to take pictures.

The image quality is amazing!!!  the zoom is also great.  It has been only a few days though; I will update my review after I use this camera for a month.There are a few problems with the design.  1- flash pops out from the upper left corner. However, It does not come out the moment the camera is turned on. Instead, it comes out when the camera detects low light.  That causes a problem when you are holding the camera from that corner. 2- you can not charge the darn battery outside the camera - this is also very annoying.  The charger is a tiny unit and the cable is very short.  So I have to put the camera on the floor close to the power outlet  :( 3- it feels like cheaply built ... or cheap components are used ...I would have given 5 stars but the location of the flash and the way that the camera is charged are very annoying.

Unless I was a professional photographer, I can't imagine needing more camera for photos and videos than this little gem.  Charging the camera by computer while you are transferring files is nice, but I think I'll be opting for another battery and non-usb charger.  Watching recordings on tv via HDMI or the provided cables uses a lot of power and the camera must be turned off when recharging.  If you're not familiar with backlighting you're going to love it.

Since I am the main photographer in the family, I thoroughly researched available options.  When I say \"photographer,\" I am using the term lightly--while I love taking photographs, always document major events, do some minor photo editing, and do spend some time making albums/scrapbooks as well, I am by no means an expert or even an \"amateur\" photographer.  Therefore, I was looking for a quality camera that would take excellent photos, but one that would do most of the work for me rather than require me to fool with a lot of settings myself.  The one feature that was particularly important to me was a superior zoom lens, which is part of what attracted me to this model.Overall, I have been very satisfied with the Nikon S8200.  I am probably most pleased with the zoom lens, which captures shots of amazing quality, particularly in comparison to my previous camera.  Another feature that I unexpectedly love is the \"Selective Color\" option, which allows you to take a photo highlighting a single color (for example, the red of a rose against black & white).  You can also change photos to black and white or sepia right on the camera, and there are plenty of other great shooting options such as continuous burst and best shot selector.  Finally, if you are someone who DOES like to fiddle with settings, you definitely can--EVERY single setting on this camera allows for individual adjustments to the user's specifications.Several other reviewers have mentioned that the placement of the flash on the camera is a problem, especially since it pops up.  Yes, the placement is a bit awkward, but because it pops up when you are focusing, you DO have time to move your hand out of the way before actually taking the photo, so I haven't found this to be a problem.  What I DON'T like, however, is that the only way to reset the flash to the \"down\" position is to turn the camera off.There are a few other things that I don't like about this camera as well.  For me, these issues are quite minor, but I am mentioning them in case they might be important to others.-->If I take a vertical (portrait) photo, the camera displays the photo in the same orientation, whereas my previous, older camera re-adjusted the orientation manually (e.g., so that all photos faced the same direction when the camera was held upright).-->The camera has two different SCENE settings.  For one, the user chooses the scenes manually (choices include \"Food,\" Party/indoor,\" \"Sports,\" \"Snow,\" and 10 others), but for the other SCENE selection, the camera choose the appropriate scene.  However, this is just confusing to me--which is better?  Do I choose?  Do I let the camera choose?-->At first, I was finding that the camera was having a second or two of lag time in transferring photos to the memory card (especially in low light), but that was when I was using my old 1 GB memory card.  So, I purchased a new Lexar Professional 16GB SDHC 133x Class 10 Flash Memory Card, and since then, I have not experienced any further speed issues.Again, none of these things have been major concerns for me; at most, they might bring down my rating of the camera to about 4 1/2 stars.  Still, I would highly recommend this Nikon, especially for casual photographers like myself.  If you do purchase this camera, I would also recommend the Must Have Accessories Bundle Kit For Nikon Coolpix.  This is worth it just for the extra battery and charger (neither of which come with the camera), but you also get several other nice bonus items, include a very good case and a USB converter.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overheated in Video mode, froze scrolling through images", "Author": "harrobwil", "ReviewID": "R16L5REBBAHJCU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I returned Nikon Coolpix S8200 camera mainly because when in play mode it would lock-up when scrolling through (still) pictures that I had taken.

Other photos that were too dark, such as landscapes taken at dusk, revealed exquisite details when shadows and highlights were removed. I captured a number of prize shots while my more elaborately equipped co-travelers fiddled with lenses or settings. Video quality was also excellent.  In the end, I was delighted with the convenience and versatility of this small camera. Even our guide was impressed with its capabilities. The only advantage of the larger cameras was the capability of shooting birds on the wing. This was hampered both by the limitations of the LCD screen vs the viewfinders of the SLR's and by the delay between the button press and the shot.

It's easy to use and has a lot of cool features, and great quality HD video too.That being said, the low star review is due to the camera just stopped working suddenly and would not come back on. I work in IT for a living, so I troubleshoot technology on a daily basis. I tried a different battery and charge cables, allowed the device sufficient time to charge, but the display would not come on, and the lens would sometimes extend out like it was on, sometimes not; the display was \"lighting up\", but nothing on the screen, just black. Camera just DIED. It was my wife's favorite camera, so she was heartbroken. It was within the standard one-year manufacturer's warranty, so I called in a service order with Nikon. It was surprisingly easy how quickly they generated a case and had me send them my camera. In fact, it was a little too easy. So I pay $10 to have it FedEx'd to a Nikon repair center in New York. The camera was promptly returned to me within 3-4 days, stating only \"no repair - not a U.S. product\" on the return invoice. Wow...GREAT...now what?So I hopped online and started chatting with amazon customer service. I explained the situation, and how disappointed I was for amazon selling me the camera knowing I would never get service for it; and I was especially disappointed since my wife truly loved the camera while it worked. So the amazon rep takes a few moments and, after some \"words\", I got them to process a refund for me. So I ship the camera back, and today (10/11/13), I see my refund invoice in my email...AMAZON CHARGED ME A $42 RESTOCKING FEE FOR THIS STUPID CAMERA!

I played with it a bit, started taking pictures in different modes to see that it was working properly and the same thing started happening again. First the autofocus when zoomed in wasn't working, then it wouldn't focus at all, even when fully zoomed out, and now the lens is completely stuck and won't retract into the camera at all and I get a \"lens error\" message when I turn it on-- or rather, that's what happened when the power button was still functioning...

Usually I can achieve proper focus by just making a small change in the zoom setting. But not always.As one might expect from such a long zoom lens, distortion at the edge of images can be pretty bad, particularly at wide zoom angles. There's no workaround for this.Maybe my biggest complaint is dynamic range. This really shows up in contrasty images. Crushing the highlights is not unusual in digital cameras and can usually be tolerated because it doesn't bother the rest of the image. Not so in the s8200. Take a picture of a car in bright sunlight. You'll see bothersome flare around every point of strong sunlight reflection. I just took a picture of a scene with some fairly dark trees surrounding a light slate roof. I could put up with crushing the detail in the roof, but there's a big bloom area that extends far beyond the roof. This just should not be in a decently implemented moderately priced camera. I can reduce the bloom to relatively small proportions by cutting exposure down to the -2.0 limit, but then most of the rest of the photo is too dark. When I take the same photo with my wife's canon s100, the bloom isn't there.I was prepared to like this camera for its features, but the image and focusing defects are making me think I'll return it.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very happy", "Author": "Bk", "ReviewID": "R3TX97EHY95WQV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this camera only for three weeks.

I have another Nikon that I just love but the size is larger and would never fit in my purse.I first purchased a Sony camera that had the capability to manually select settings; it was a touch more expensive than the Nikon.  Other than that the features were almost identical to the Nikon S8200.  My first inclination was to go with the Nikon because of past experience with Nikon cameras but I thought I'd give the Sony a try because of the added features.I played around with the Sony camera trying out the different settings.  I was not totally pleased and I had some blurred photos that should not have been blurred.  I have been a photography buff for over 30 years so I know what type of photos I should be getting.  Since I had 90 days to return the camera to the place of purchase without penalty, I was glad that I took my time.  About a month and a half into the 90 days, I purchased the Nikon S8200 from the same place so that I could do multiple side-by-side comparisons.I tried all of the settings on both cameras.  I wasn't totally comfortable with not being able to push down the flash on the Nikon as I could on the Sony and have it stay down.  My way to work around that is to just push down the flash and hold it with my finger if I don't want to use the flash despite what the camera is telling me.  Problem solved.  What finally sold me on the Nikon and made me return the Sony camera was when I took photos of some roses in a vase in my kitchen.  I took many photos with both cameras and tried every setting on each camera.  In every photo I took with the Sony I never was able to capture the true color of the roses.  They were either washed out or the color was more vivid than they were in real life.  The roses were a pinkish orange.  With the Sony they appeared as a vivid orange.  When I took the same photos with the Nikon under the same lighting conditions and using all of the settings on the camera just to experiment, the color of the roses in the photos were right on.  That sold me on the camera.I knew in my heart that I should have gone with the Nikon from Day One but I thought I'd try the other one out. Over this past weekend I used the camera extensively for a birthday party and for photos before a school dance with 12 couples as the subjects.  The photos came out very nice for both affairs.

I would recommend buying this camera great buy", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT, BUT...", "Author": "Stoney", "ReviewID": "R2PZN5YMEJTSTQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the S8200 is a classic \"camel\"---a horse designed by a committee. It is brilliantly engineered, and loaded with terrific features. The overall ergonomic design and layout of the controls is marvelous---but the assignment of functions to those controls, and the organization of the features, was VERY poorly thought-out and poorly implemented. Many features have misleading names and some are redundant. Incredibly, (incredibly stupidly) the most valuable, most advanced, features such as \"High Dynamic Range\" and \"Noise Reduction\" (both of which combine bursts of photos for improved sharpness or shadow/highlight detail) and others are ONLY available in the \"Basic\" (or \"Scenes\") mode where the user does NOT have access to the wide range of useful (even essential) features which are available in the \"Advanced\" (or \"Auto\") mode. That makes for a great deal of frustration and a steep learning curve.\"AUTO SCENE\" MODE NOT ADEQUATELY IDENTIFIEDThe \"Auto-Scene\" mode is indicated on the \"modes dial\" by a little heart. It is probably overlooked by the very users who would most benefit from using it. In fact, this is the most-\"Basic\" mode, for users who do not want to learn to use the advanced features. It would be better as the first option in the \"Scenes\" mode.\"CONTINUOUS\" MODE MISNAMED AND REDUNDANTThe so-called \"Continuous\" MODE (which is different from \"Movie\" mode) is in fact the (most) \"Advanced\" mode in this camera. It includes ALL the menus, features, and options of the \"Auto\" mode, plus the various \"Continuous\" FEATURES which includes the options of 5-shot bursts, \"Best Shot Selection\", and \"Pre-Shooting Cache\", and more. The \"Continuous\" FEATURES should be an sub-menu in the \"Auto\" mode menu (with the addition of an \"off\" or \"single shot\" option), and the \"Continuous Mode\" should be eliminated.UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS OF OPTIONS IN \"SCENE\" MODEAt first glance, the \"scenes\" in the \"Scene\" mode look like helpful options, even for advanced users. They aren't---they are sour fruit---because you loose access to nearly every function, option, or setting which are available in the \"Advanced\" (or \"Auto\") mode. In most cases, you can't even turn the flash on or off. Unless you carry around the 228-page \"Coolpix S8200 Manual\" with you, you have no idea what the pre-selected, fixed, features and settings correspond to any particular \"scene\" (overriding any settings you made in the \"Advanced\" [aka \"Auto\"] mode).\"HELP\" IS UNHELPFULThe so-called \"Help\" is unhelpful. If you select \"Help\" with a \"scene\", it describes what the \"scene\" is (which is pretty much self-explanatory anyway), such as \"Portrait is for portraits\", \"Landscapes is for landscapes\", \"Sports is for sports\", \"Sunset is for sunsets\", etc. but it does NOT tell you which pre-determined, fixed, features the camera will use for those \"scenes\". For example, it would be helpful if the \"Help\" mentioned that the \"Skin softening\" function is automatically used in the \"Portrait\" mode. Or, it might be helpful to know that in the \"Museum scene\" the flash is turned off, and the camera is set to \"Best Shot Selection\" mode.There is no \"Help\" to explain functions, options, or settings. For example, there is no \"Help\" to explain what \"HDR\", \"BSS\" or \"Low Key\" are, or how to use \"Selective Color\" or \"Easy Panorama\".NO CONTROL OF CONTRASTSometimes the dynamic range (difference between the blackest blacks and whitest whites) is too great, requiring reduction of the contrast, or you may want to increase the contrast of cloudy-day photos. Unfortunately, there is no \"contrast\" feature. You can adjust the \"brightness\", but that's not the same as \"contrast\".The \"vividness\" feature can be used adjusts saturation (the intensity of color)--but that is NOT the same thing as \"contrast\".The \"High Dynamic Range\" function (which, in effect, reduces contrast) is available only in the \"Backlighting\" mode, but if you choose \"Backlighting\" mode, you loose access to nearly every function, option, or setting which are available in the \"Advanced\" (i.e., \"Auto\") mode.HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE POORLY IMPLEMENTEDThe \"High Dynamic Range\" function takes a burst of photos and combines them into a single photo, in effect, reducing the contrast. Most advanced digital cameras will take a burst of photos at slightly different exposures which can be combined to produce a higher dynamic range, under the control of the user--the result is finely detailed photos with detail both in the darkest shadows (if desired) and in the brightest highlights (if desired). In the S8200, the crippled HDR feature is hidden in a single mode (\"Backlighting\"), and the user has only the choice of three levels. The entire burst should be saved (but isn't), so that post-photo processing can be used.NO BRACKETING FUNCTION\"Bracketing\" (i.e., a \"burst\" function which takes 5 or so photos at different exposures) is a popular function available in all \"professional\" digital cameras. Logically, \"Bracketing\" could be combined with the \"High Dynamic Range\" function---i.e., if the HDR burst was saved, those would (de facto) be bracketed exposures.\"AUTO FOCUS\" FUNCTION MISNAMEDALL of the 6 focusing functions are \"auto\". There is NO \"manual focus\" in the traditional photographic sense. The \"Auto\" focus option, under \"AF Area\" function is in fact the \"focus on the closest object\" option. Many users are likely to mistakenly assume that \"Auto\" is the best general purpose setting--it isn't, although it is useful in some circumstances.\"CENTER\" FOCUS REDUNDANTWhen you choose misnamed \"Manual\" focus, the display actually begins in \"Center\" focus mode-you have to tap on the \"OK\" button to change to \"Manual\" focus. \"Manual\" focus allows you to move the focusing bracket. If you tap the \"OK\" button after moving the focusing bracket, the bracket freezes at the location, then you can use the selector wheel and \"OK\" button to select the \"Brightness\", Hue, or \"Vividness\" functions--a good design. What's need is a \"reset\" (say, by \"double-clicking\" the \"OK\" button, to recenter the focusing bracket.YOU CANNOT CANCEL THE POPUP FLASH BY SIMPLY PUSHING THE FLASH DOWNI can cancel the pop-up flash for the next photo by simply pushing it back down on my Nikon 8100, which was very convenient---but for some silly reason that is forbidden on the 8200. It's annoying that you have to turn the camera off to retract the flash. As others have noted, the location of the flash is where your left index finger wants to be. However a 1\" x 3/16\" length of self-adhesive \"velcro\" over the \"flash\" hatch, can remind you to keep your index finger back out of the way.CLUTTERED \"MODE\" DIALThere should only be two \"photo-taking\" modes: \"Basic\" and \"Advanced\", whatever they are called. The name \"Auto\" mode (for the \"Advanced\" picture-taking mode) is acceptable for consistency with more advanced cameras which have actual manual modes. However, in this camera, \"Auto\" is confusing since there are four (4!) other arbitrary \"automatic\" picture-taking modes available on the \"mode dial\": \"Continuous\", \"Scenes\", \"Auto-Scene\" and \"Effects\". \"Movie\" mode (the 6th picture-taking mode) is inexplicably available via a different button. In addition, the dial is cluttered the misnamed \"Night Landscape\", \"Backlighting\", and \"Pet Portrait\" modes which are really just \"scenes\" which should logically be accessed from the menu of the \"Scenes\" mode.The \"Advanced\" modes, \"Auto\", \"Continuous\", and \"Effects\" should be combined in the \"Auto\" mode. The \"Basic\" modes (\"Scenes\" and \"Auto-Scene\") should be combined as the \"Scenes\" mode. \"Setup\", \"Playback\" (at least the various editing and copying functions) and \"Movie\" could logically be the other modes accessed on the \"modes dial\".\"SETUP\" AND \"IMAGE MODE\" UNNECESSARILY CLUTTER EVERY MENUThe misnamed \"Image Mode\" (i.e., the \"resolution\") would be more logically placed in the \"Setup\" menu (only). \"Setup\" (or \"Setup/Settings\") would be better as a mode in the \"mode dial\" rather than cluttering-up EVERY menu the camera displays.NO CONTROL OF DEPTH-OF-FIELDThe Nikon 8200 can take excellent closeups, even from 20 feet (or more, or less) away, which makes it ideal for nature lovers, but with one glaring shortcoming. There is no control over depth-of-field. Indeed, according to the specifications (pg 6) the aperture has only 2 positions f3.3 and f6.6 (at the widest zoom), although you don't have a choice even there. F6.6 at the shortest focal length (wide zoom) may translate into about f11 at long focal lengths (telephoto zoom), for a little more depth-of-focus. At the other extreme, in true portraits you usually want the background to be blurry. F3.3 (at widest zoom) probably translates to about f5.6 at a semi-telephoto zoom appropriate for portraits, which is probably will NOT sufficiently blur the background.\"EFFECTS\" MODE MENU POORLY DESIGNEDBesides the misnamed \"Image Mode\" (i.e., resolution, which really should be in the \"Setup\"/\"Settings\" menu), the ONLY option in the \"Effects\" mode menu is the \"Special Effects\" submenu. There are only 6 effects, all which could be listed on the basic \"Effects\" menu---the sub-menu is a wasted step. The entire submenu should be moved to the \"Advanced\" (\"Auto\") mode menu, and the \"Effects mode\" eliminated.\"EASY\" PANORAMA UNNECESSARILY RESTRICTIVE\"Easy Panorama\" can only be used at the widest zoom position, and only for a \"width\" of 180 or 360 degrees. I can see times I might want to take a panorama at a semi-telephoto zoom for 90 degrees, for example, but that option is not available.\"MAGNIFY\" AVAILABLE ONLY IN \"PLAYBACK\" MODEA \"quick-magnify\" function accessed by a \"push to magnify\" button, which would magnify the area of the focusing brackets would be very useful, to confirm the focus, particularly in closeup photography, however, there is no way to magnify a portion of the screen while in a \"picture-taking\" mode.NO \"BLACK AND WHITE\" FUNCTIONThere's a \"Sepia\" function (brown and white), and even a \"High-contrast monochrome\" function (for photographic white boards, text, etc.) but no (normal contrast) \"Black and White\" function. You can get \"black and white\" by setting the \"vividness\" function to zero--but how many users will know that?VOICE MEMO LIMITEDYou can only add a voice memo to an existing picture, by turning off the camera, and selecting \"Voice Memo\" from the \"Playback\" menu. A much better design would be a simple \"push to record\" button which would add a memo to the last-taken photo when in \"picture-taking\" mode, or to the \"selected\" photo in \"Playback\" mode.\"QUICK RETOUCH\" AND \"D-LIGHTING\" NOT RECOMMENDED\"Quick Retouch\" and \"D-lighting\" in the \"Playback\" menu make copies of existing photos, enhancing the contrast, brightness, and saturation of the copy. I suspect that many users will make copies of the copies to further \"pop-up\" their photos. However, \"if it ain't there, you can't enhance it\". That is, if the highlights are so bright that detail is washed out (lost), or shadows are so dark that detail is lost, it CANNOT be recovered. Alot can be done with a proper photo-editing program and a big computer monitor (to see the detail), but on the small camera screen, these functions are more likely to damage an image than improve it. A useable \"High Dynamic Range\" feature would be far more useful.DESCRIPTION OF \"CLOSEUP\" SCENE OPTION WRONGAccording to the \"Coolpix 8200 Reference Manual\", page 47, \"Macro mode is enable and the camera automatically zooms to the closest position at which it can focus\". In fact the \"Closeup\" scene option sets the focus to \"continuous\" operation, NOT to the closest position.JPEG ONLYThe 8200 save images in the JPEG format only, with a minimum compression of 4X. JPEG always degrades the image.  Why not LZW (lossless) TIFF or even RAW?  Sure they take up more memory space, but memory is cheap these days.NEEDS AN EXTRA BATTERYThe battery holds a good charge, but, especially taking alot of video, in \"Disneyland\" or at the \"Grand Canyon\", you can drain the battery pretty quickly. The ideal solution is to have an extra charged battery handy. Fortunately they are cheap.

Unfortunately, it holds only the camera--you need another case for accessories.  There is room for a \"spare battery compartment\" to the right of the lens, but no such compartment. There is a \"spare memory card\" compartment---but using it risks scratching the viewing screen.  But that's a good place for a piece of paper with your name, address, and phone---in case you loose the camera and it is found by the right person.  It is important to protect the battery contacts from shorting-out when not in the camera.

However, using a neckcord for a few hours resulted in the display of my camera becoming badly scratched by swinging against my plastic shirt buttons.NEEDS A TRIPOD OR MONOPODThe S8200 has such a sensitive sensor and such effective image stabilization that hand-held long-telephoto photos can be sharp. The problem is that it is hard to frame a long-telephoto photo hand-holding, and it is impossible to tell if the camera is actually focusing on your subject.  Most tripods or monopods are so bulky that they defeat the whole purpose of such a compact camera.  However, I've found that the tiny Norazza TD140 monopod dies the job providing the necessary stability to make the most use of the incredible telephoto abilities of this camera.  Norazza Monopod-lightweight TD140COOLPIX S8200 MANUAL (available as a pdf file only) IS NOT \"COMMENTABLE\"So, for example, even you have Adobe Acrobat or other tools, you cannot even highlight or underline a sentence to remind yourself of an important point.

Most are when you use the zoom option.  The S95 has too many bells and whistles, and I wanted a camera I could turn on and take a picture, and this one fit the bill!  The options are buried deep down in the S95, and I didn't like having to get out the manual every time I took pictures.  The Nikon 8200 has the best options right on the camera dials. Easy!  The zoom is awesome, and looks just as clear as taking them without the zoom.  I was used to the flash pop-up from the S95.  I just move my finger, and if it bothers me, I turn it off and back on.  That takes a couple of seconds. The HD video looks and sounds great.  'Record' is a separate button on the camera, and you don't have to move the dial.  The camera does go black for a second when you push Record, so be ready a second before you start recording.  The battery life is good, too.

I have several thousand dollars invested, so my purchase was made as much out of brand loyalty as any other factor. The guy at the store and I were comparing zooming and movies and such... I was sure this was it. I noticed there wasn't a M (for manual) on the dial. I thought: \" it'll be someplace in the menus.\" All of Canon's compacts have it. Kodak has it. It's on there.\" WRONG.They spit out all these numbers about resolution, pixel count, and that rear screen makes them look so good! Yeah, only when they're that small. If you only intend to make 4x6 prints with the photos from this camera, then I'm sure it's fine. I don't need to make billboards, but geez! At least I should be able to see it on my 24\" screen.I'm not sure GPS was any kind of deal breaker, but three other comparably priced and featured cameras have it!The flash! Don't get me started. It pops up in this crazy spot and then you can't put it back down! True. It only goes down when the camera turns off. Who was in charge of that feature? Every online review has mentioned this problem. BTW, it is a really good flash unit.The rubber thumb grip on back is a little inadequate. Since I only get to use one hand (The flash and lens take away the ability to use the other) I need to be able to hold onto the camera. The JPG quality is horrible. I'm surprised that Nikon would do so badly with it. They have good compression on the consumer dSLR's. I know they're more expensive, but JPG compression doesn't come from their R&D;, it is available anywhere. You can forget about cropping any of these photos; they're too badly compressed. There are too many artifacts.The unit seems to randomly have trouble focusing on objects. There seems to be no rhyme or reason. Sometimes it just won't lock focus and it doesn't matter if it's close (even with macro mode turned on) or far, light or dark.Given all these negatives, there are a few good things about it. The movies look good on my 42\" television. That they got right. It records in 1080p. The anti shake is good for me and the colors are vibrant and attractive. I did not make use of the stereo microphones, so I have no comment on that matter. The unit powers up quickly and when it feels like focusing it gives quick focus. The rapid fire 10-shot burst works wonderfully. It's great for sporting events or anything moving. The lens is clear, fast, and has a great breadth of range.All-in-all the Nikon Coolpix S8200 is overpriced for the amount of camera that you get. If you just want to shoot snapshots and print 4x6's or upload to social media sites, then get a less expensive camera with the same feature set. Olympus and Canon have some wonderful offerings, some of which are waterproof. If you are a photographer, whether advanced amateur or professional, then move on down the line.

This camera, for its price-range, is loaded with many great picture options. I have had several digital cameras before I stumbled across the `Coolpix' brand in Nikon. None of them have had the kind of quality I've been able to gain from the Coolpix line. In specific, I have owned the S3300 and the S6100 before the S8200. There were no issues with the previous cameras...I just outgrew the features and moved onto `bigger and better'.The pros far outweigh the cons with this camera. It's not to be expected to get `professional-grade-photos' from this digital as it is NOT a `professional' camera, but that does not mean that you will be foregoing quality here.  I am not upset by any slight distortion/clutter in the movie option due to the fact that I wanted a camera...not a camcorder. The video quality is above acceptable for my uses of it. Also, it's normal for most digital cameras to have a shorter battery life especially when extra features are added and utilized (such as a GPS option which is NOT in this camera model). The flash, which some are bothered by, is in an awkward position for most hands, but I have had no problems with it as I have smaller hands and hold my cameras differently. I am slightly disappointed with the slower-to-take pictures if I am in certain modes, but the overall picture quality is worth any additional, slight wait. The wait is never present on Auto Mode.

They scrutinized the camera to find any blemish and labeled it as an \"impact\" spot so that it wasn't covered under warranty. I can guarantee that there was no impact that caused the failure. So, anyway, I now have a $300 brick camera. I personally will not be using Nikon again.

I did not want the GPS feature on the canon either (drains batteries).

Our daughter is turning a year old and I'm tired of all the crummy picts my old camera takes so we decided to look for a new one before her bday party and I am so glad we decided on this one! I was worried we wouldn't get it in time because it had such a broad arrival date but we got it in plenty of time, only a week after we ordered it. I'm not very technologically smart so I was a little skeptical about my ability to run something with so many features but I've found it's quite simple for something so advanced. The features it's equipped with are awesome! There's a 'pet portrait' that automatically takes a pict when you point it at an animal-every other digital, phone, and disposable camera I've used to take picts of my dog leaves his a eyes a white glare and this one takes a very detailed and clear pict with no glare at all! There is a 'smile' feature that automatically takes a pict when you aim it a person and they smile which is really nice bcuz if you have kids you know every smile counts and we want to catch it-the flash it super quick and I love that there is NO DELAY. It flashes once and takes the pict as it flashes so she doesn't have time to react and close her eyes :) I can't tell you how many picts we have of her with her eyes closed or squinted! It has an auto 'red eye fix' that saves me a lot of time when I go through and print off picts. It has a feature that you can set to take picts in black and white or red or gray tint which is cool if I'm taking a pict and her outfit clashes with someone else's outfit (I've never been able to do that, you can always make the pict black and white when you print it off, but this will save you some time). This camera has an excellent zoom that doesn't take away from the quality or clearity of the pict no matter how far you zoom. It comes with a rechargeable lithium battery which is a huge money saver for us bcuz we take a ton of picts and used to go through a lot of AA batteries, which aren't cheap. You can also take videos and the 'auto steady' feature is really impressive. It's not a setting that you have to turn on, it just automatically does it and it makes a huge difference. Out of curiosity I took a pict of some decorations with this one and our old camera and the difference in the two is unbelivable! This camera takes spectacular picts that are crisp, clear, bright and overall really great in quality. My only regret it that we didn't order this camera sooner.

I had to get a new camera because the screen on my other one got cracked, and I wanted a better camera rather than replacing the screen. I also just got the S8200 a few days ago, and this is first thoughts review.I'm sure most of the complaints are about the quality of the photos- that's just because you might have to mess around with the settings first. My first Coolpix was an S220, so all the controls were a bit different. I had to look through the reference manual, which is on a CD to figure some of them out. There are settings where you can take sequences of photos, and I had to figure out how to make that stop.Once you learn the controls a little better, it's a LOT easier to use. My other complaint is the flash. Once it comes up, you have to turn the entire thing back off to get it to go back down.It's a little bigger than most cameras, but that is because of the large lens to get the larger zoom.Overall, as the basic \"photographer\" my pictures came out very nice. After I figured out how to use the settings, it was a lot more fun to use the camera.I wish the flash could be pushed back down, but that's the only real issue, everything else you have to (and can) figure out with the manual. (You know, like most things.)Update: I LOVE THIS CAMERA! We went to Washington, D.C and my camera took the best pictures! My entire family now has a coolpix of some sort.Another slight issue is, sometimes if you are close to something, but you want to zoom in more, the camera won't focus.

If you have the time, wait as you press the shutter release, but this camera is quick! One review I read complained about the flash popping up in the top left corner -they were right! Everyone I know holds the camera in their left hand with fingers on top so they can press the button with their right hand. Then, suddenly, you feel this pressure under your fingers. Oh no, here comes the flash! Nikon should have thought that one through better. One other cool thing about this unit, it takes panorama shots of 180 or 360 degrees!

It also has an awesome 1080 video with stereo mics. I used it at a concert and it had great sound and the picture was great too (even zoomed to the max optical). The pixs were so-so without the flash indoors  ( a bit blurry) - with the flash under 10 feet were very good, outdoor great! The 16.1 MP is good for this size camera.  The S9200 was not as good as the S8200 in my opinion.  Now there is a NEW S9300, but I cannot comment on that one, as have not tried it yet. Paid just over $200.00 - and take as good pictures as my $800 DSLR Sony alpha 350, but not as fast on moving objects.

I find it hard to believe it is the 3 separate batteries at fault, and I have become very careful not to use any unnecessary features, such as reviewing photos, or constant focusing. It often refuses to focus, especially when in close-up, or zoom. Today, the camera takes very poorly colored, grainy pictures without the flash, whereas it was great to begin with. I cannot take any pictures of the moon, no matter what kind of weather, which is 50% what I bought it for.

I've had this camera for a few days now and it takes great pictures. The video quality is great as well!

Before purchasing the camera, I did extensive research in regards to functionality of the camera as well as user reviews. So I had an idea of what I was getting into with this camera. My main issue is the flash location. The flash \"pops up\" in an awkward position, and is \"UNABLE\" to be put back down unless the camera is turned off completely. Though when you do turn off the camera to put the flash down, it goes down automatically, no user intervention is necessary. It is just unnecessary to turn off the camera just to get rid of the pop up flash. Pushing it down when the camera is on, just pops it right back up. As stated from Nikon Article 50879 \"There are no plans or service options at the present time to modify the camera so that the flash is lowered manually by pushing it down.\"Source: [...]The flash in itself is great, however, should not have to turn off the camera just to put the pop up flash back down.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "One year later and still loving it.

Witty", "ReviewID": "R1CRPGPXQL3GLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, the price is just under $200.00, and that's not a particularly small amount of money but, for the price, there really is a lot of camera in this camera. I was, and still am for that matter, impressed that there are actual, functional options for focusing and metering. Before film got too expensive and somewhat inconvenient to process I was shooting with a Nikon FM2 and absolutely loved that camera, and though comparing the S8200 to the FM2 is a case of \"apples and oranges\", it's nice to find that the camera offers some control over the metering and focus, as does the FM2, and as a result, produces absolutely beautiful images as did the FM2.My only gripe, and this is probably an issue with all rear displays on digital cameras, is that in bright sunlight the displayed image appears to disappear until you shade the display with your hand or turn away from your subject. The first time I saw this happen I thought I'd accidentally powered the camera off but no, in bright sunlight at the proper angle, (and lord only knows what that is), the display looks black, just like when the camera actually is powered off. Fortunately, the ability to take a picture with one hand while simultaneously shading the display with the other so you can still see what you're shooting is an option with the S8200.So, the camera is small, lightweight, loaded with nice features, and is very easy to use. Would that I could upload a sample picture with this review but, since I can't, you'll have to take my word for it about the picture quality and everything else. I will say that the pictures I have taken with this camera are nothing short of amazing. The colors are vibrant, the images are very sharp, and the metering options really do make a visible difference and come in very handy when shooting outdoors. A few of the pictures I have from a recent road trip are so clear, crisp, and sharp it almost looks like you could step right into the photo. My use of Photoshop with the images was minimal and consisted mainly of cropping the images to what I saw in my head at the time I composed and took the picture. No sharpening was needed and, other than a few early pictures when I was figuring the camera out, little if any color, contrast, or brightness adjustments were needed. Most of the pictures taken later in the trip required only cropping and nothing else.In short, this is a great little camera and I won't be going on any road trips without it.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Shots", "Author": "Charlotte O'donnell \"IrishGal\"", "ReviewID": "R2FTHCPUNBMGRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great shots, easy to use, quick focus between shots so I can catch a moment I might have missed.

I'm not 100% thrilled with the graininess I see in the pictures when the lens is fully extended, but I rarely do that (If I shot a lot of that type, I'd lean more towards the DSLR family).  I find Nikon cameras easy to use, intuitive and weighted correctly for the hand.  I agree with others in that if you're not used to the flash it can take awhile to get used to - but I like the throwback design of the pop-up flash.

Dormont", "ReviewID": "RVOUDT8CM0K0X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bottom line: utter lack of manual controls, some poor automatic choices, mediocre IQ, weak AF, and a lame flash design all amount to make this an over-priced, under-performing travel zoom. That said, under the right conditions (sunrise to sunset), this is a nifty little camera that in the right hands can take great photos and fool your friends at home into thinking you lugged the big guy out.If you like your nikon DSLR, but don't want to stash a camera bag when you go on vacation or are traveling on your next voyage and you thought \"I bet Nikon has a great travel zoom\" you're making the same mistake I did. It's extraordinarily frustrating not having any control over aperture and even trying to outsmart the camera by boosting ISO won't give you a satisfactorily high shutter speed in many occasions. So if you're looking for a pocketable version of your DSLR with nice focal range look elsewhere.But put it on auto (the modes are silly), and you can change WB, color sat, exp compensation, metering and AF mode to take a bit more control (slightly ironic I think). The video is easy, intuitive, and high quality and in the more than 1k shots I took with this on safari (didn't have the option of bringing my DSLR) I have many wonderful memories and many excellent photos. A 350mm equivalent focal distance will help a lot paired with relatively fast continuous shooting.Overall, not recommended for the DSLR amateur or enthusiast, but can be great for someone who just wants good quality pics on their travels.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon COOLPIX S8200 16.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 14x Optical Zoom...", "Author": "Kenneth R.

Silly me (I'm amazed at how durable it was and how long it continued to work after being dropped, cracked open, and put back together).  I bought this as a replacement; it's a similar camera, and was cheaper, thanks to the advancement of technology.This is not the groundbreaking camera that the S8100 is.  When I bought the S8100, I tested it out alongside a bunch of other cameras from various manufacturers, and I felt that it was way ahead of other point-and-shoots in its price range.  It was a very balanced camera relative to its resolution; I found it took much better pictures than some cameras with a higher megapixel rating.This camera adds more zoom (10x->14x), MUCH better image stabilization, faster flash cycling, and that's about it.  The megapixel rating has jumped from 12 to 16, and you know what that means?  Absolutely nothing.  I think that, for once, Nikon has created an imbalanced camera, where the resolution of the sensor is not the limiting factor when taking photos.  I also don't like that the flash can't be mechanically popped down, once popped up; you need to turn off the camera to do this.  But I do find the flash cycling is faster, which I like.On the image stabilization...it's really, really good compared to the previous model, and I thought it was already good.  I am able to take photos at about 1/3rd the shutter speed that I was on the S8100, and have them still come out okay.  I am pretty wowed by this one advancement.  But in practice, it's not really as much of a gain as you'd think, because once you get below maybe about 1/30th of a second, you're going to see blur unless you are looking at a completely still target anyway.My remaining comments about this are pretty much the same as the S8100; if you want the whole thing, read my review of that camera.  Quick summary: great low-light performance, small size, easy to use, quick startup and flash cycling.  Downsides: ISO change requires going into the menu, writing images is slow even with a fast memory card, and STILL has overzealous noise correction.I'd buy it again, but, if I hadn't needed a quick replacement camera similar to my old one, I would have tested out other cameras more, because this one didn't really amaze me the way the S8100 did in its day.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "phoenix", "ReviewID": "R1LK5QGI031GID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this was a really good camera, i've been using it for about a year.  the pics are high quality, the videos are good, and theres lots of settings you can use for different situations... like landscape, sunset, night landscape, up close for flowers and bugs and leaves, ... you can set the camera on a flat surface and it will take pictures 10-15 seconds later BY ITSELF!  and also the battery is really good and it doesnt take very long to turn the camera on and off.  the only thing that i didnt like about it is sometimes the camera auto-adjusts lighting... sometimes i want to take a picture without the autoadjust lighting, but its a digital camera so idk if you can get around that.  but yea basically its a great camera. and the memory chip plugs right into the side of my macbook pro, so i dont have to worry about the obnoxious transfer wires that take like 1 hr to find but its the wrong one so you have to look for the other one... and then you forget which one is the actual wire... haha you all know what i mean", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "nikon  s8200  16.1 excellent", "Author": "atilla", "ReviewID": "R4IP79F4Z3BNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon COOLPIX S8200 16.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 14x Optical Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Black)In short an excellent camera with its features except pop-up flash.

Beal", "ReviewID": "R2TL76NSIV08W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for 4 months now.  I'm still amazed at the quality and the cool features packed into this sweet little camera.  I've shared some pictures in the view section.  They're the fireworks shots, which I took this past Independence day. This camera has a scene selection just for that.  Please take a look at my shots. ( Just a note about the fireworks feature:  Make sure you keep the camera still.  The shutter takes about 4 seconds to capture these shots.  One should use a tripod...or do what I did.  As I was sitting in my lawn chair, I held the camera still, between my knees.  Hey, worked great for me!! ).Anyway, I've noticed that a lot of buyers are complaining about the flash placement.  I agree, it is kind of odd to place a pop-up flash where we tend to hold these small cameras, but the camera was designed to be held with one hand.  So, once you're used to that idea, you will absolutely love this camera.  Now I said it was \"designed\" to be held with one hand, so take a good look at the camera right now, ( front and back ).  On the front, there is a bar running vertically, between the names NIKON and COOLPIX.  This is where one's right hand, middle finger, would rest.  It might not look like enough of a grip there, but trust me, it is.  On the back of the camera, there is a thumb pad, right beside the record button...the one with the bright red dot.  You'll find that holding the camera this way is quite comfortable. And of course, your index finger is free to do the shutter button work.  The anti-shake feature work incredibly well, so don't worry about the old one-hand-shake.  The rest of the functions will have to be adjusted with you other hand.  Don't worry, the camera works great in auto mode, if functions and settings scare you.  But frankly, this camera has so many great features, you'd be foolish to pass up on them.So, I don't see a design flaw here.

It seemed to have everything I wanted or needed without breaking my pocketbook. I'd only had it a short while so was still figuring out and playing with all the settings.Yesterday morning I woke up to the whooshing sound that indicated a hot air balloon was over my house. I grabbed the camera and took a couple of pictures. The images showed our lovely blue Colorado sky and beautifully rich colors of the balloon. Was excited to get some pictures of my daughter at her first Renaissance Festival later that morning, but it was not to be. When we got there I took photos of the jester and the fairies that were entertaining the crowd, my daughter took a picture of me with a huge Taurus, then we went to get our hair braided. Still hadn't noticed anything was wrong until we were waiting in line to get her face painted. I reviewed the pictures I had taken thus far, and there were these strange lines obscuring the images. The hot air balloon pictures from several hours earlier were fine. I experimented with the camera and noticed as it was trying to focus the bands would appear across the screen. The image would then look fine in the viewer, until I snapped the picture.I got the camera on June 16th, 2012. It broke 7 days over the return policy time - plus I no longer have the original packaging. My question into Nikon is still unanswered, but I realize has been less than 24 hours. Feelings right now are disappointment and anger. We leave for a 10 day trip to Alaska this Friday, which is not enough time for Nikon to fix the problem and get my camera back. 37 days for the COOLPIX S8200 to break. Looks like in the next couple of days I'll be out in the stores camera shopping, for anything but a Nikon.UPDATE: Nikon fixed the camera under warranty, but I still had to purchase a new one since we were going on an amazing trip. Decided on a bit more expensive Canon. Glad I did. Learned my lesson too. Once I called Nikon, things got rolling to get the camera fixed pretty quickly.

Anytime I am going to buy something, I always go to Amazon and see what people here are saying about the product. I did not buy this camera at Amazon but I did buy it because of the reviews I read here. I've been researching my next camera for about 7-8 months now and I was ready to buy the Nikon 8100 and saw there was a newer version, this one. I read all the reviews so I knew about the flash sticking out (so no surprise there). I have another Nikon I've had for about 5 years and kind of wanted to stay with the same brand (although I was ready to get a different one if I couldn't find the right Nikon). I got this one on sale and have had it for a few days and have been very pleased.  The night time photos are great. I've done some panaramic shots that I love. I did a bunch of shots of my softball team last night. Took some video too. Lots of pet shots so far. Everything has been great.I recommend reading the manual when buying a camera like this. I read it and am referring back to it a lot. I also know a lot about the camera already from already having a Nikon, so that helps.  After a few weeks I will come back and update this - so far I'm loving this camera quite a bit.Update: I've had the camera for a couple months - I love it. No problems whatsoever. The video is excellent, in fact I've taken way more video than stills, not something I planned and it's been great. I have no gripes whatsoever with this camera. It's done everything I wanted it to do. A great buy.Update: Had problem with lens. Was producing spots under certain kinds of lights. Showed a camera expert friend and he told me the only way to get it fixed was to send it to Nikon. Called their \"support\" which was a long wait (big surprise) and eventually getting someone who basically told me to go online - all which I could have done on my own without wasting a half hour on the phone. Why they have a number to call when all they do is have you do everything online is a mystery - but I took one star off my review for that. Sent the camera in (on my own dime of course, they don't even pay for postage). Problem was under warranty so they did fix it - took about 8 weeks without the camera which of course was during Thanksgiving (so I had to use an older camera during the Holiday). Couldn't get ANYONE to return any email either as to what was going on with my camera even though I sent it registered mail so I did have a receipt saying they got it. Took four weeks for someone to just get back to me to let me know they did have it. I took off another star for that. Camera was fixed and sent back.

I was pleased with the camera until it started to have problems. After shooting a few pictures on a hot, humid day, it went black when holding the camera vertically. Therefore you cannot see what you are shooting. It worked fine horizontally. I called Nikon when I returned from my vacation and they said to send it back since it was under warranty. I did (at my own expense). It was returned in record time since I told them I was going away again. And, taking pictures at the same lake on a hot day, the camera went black again when holding it vertically. I got no satisfaction when I called Nikon, even after I spoke to a supervisor. I was told to send it back, again. They would send me a return label. But, I need the camera for an event in 2 weeks. I was told it could not be returned by then.  It should have been fixed the first time. I now have to buy another camera. I can assure you it will NOT be a Nikon.If you read below to see comments to my review, you will see the suggestion that he LCD screen may be polarized and that wearing polarized sunglasses will make the LCD screen appear black. I called Nikon to ask if that could be the case, I was told that it was NOT polarized. There was also no mention of polarization in the large instruction manual that I downloaded. But the LCD is indeed polarized. When my camera was returned to me from Nikon, I put my sunglasses on, turned the camera vertically and the screen turned black. I took off the sunglasses and had a perfectly viewable screen.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "nikon coolpix", "Author": "aileen", "ReviewID": "R17M9IPDVSM091", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "camera is easy to use and takes great pictures. There are just a few things I do not like about it. The main dislike is the very small, tiny on/off button. Way to small. The flash is small and if you don;t pay attention your finger holds it down. The camera itself is great as an x-tra camera to carry in your purse or take as as an extra camera.

I purchased this camera cause the reviews I read were good for the most part.  I purchased it new and received a used one.  I tried to use it but it just didn't seem to be working right.  It was taking forever once you turned it on to be able to take a picture.  And it just wouldn't focus on a moving object...So I returned it the next day...Amazon was amazing sending me a new one and I received it the next day.  The new one also was taking to long once you turned it on.  Guess that is how it works.  But once again the focus was still taking blurry pictures.  So I put it away for about a week...Well my husband wanted to take some pictures outside.  Well the flash was on...which is a whole different issue with this camera.  Took the picture and no picture it was all black.  So back this camera went.  The other huge reason to avoid this camera is the flash pops up right where your finger goes.  Not to mention Nikons actual customer service is the worst ever.  They told me I would hear back in 24 hours.
