{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The closest to an SLR i've ever held", "Author": "Ally Pirnat", "ReviewID": "R1BTQBGIQHNFMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For people who love digital photography, but miss the flexibility of a film camera, this is the best camera out there. I initially learned everything about photography on a black and white SLR. When digital cameras came on the market, they definitely opened up a world of possibilities - like limitless photos & ease of editing, but closed off that ability to adjust the shutter, aperture, ect. All those things that photographers loved film for. The menu on this camera is easy to understand, very straight forward - even for people who do not do much with a digital camera. Holding it feels like holding by beloved old SLR, and the  photo quality is as good.THIS CAMERA IS NOT FOR PEOPLE NEW TO PHOTOGRAPHY. There are too many options, and a beginner or novice will just be frustrated.This camera will not teach things like composition and balance, or any other basic skill of photography. Stick to a point-and-shoot until you've exhausted all your options.The learning curve, as with any camera but especially any Digital SLR, is a steep one.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$384.99", "Features": "16.1MP High Sensitivity MOS Sensor\nLSI Venus Engine Image Processor\nLeica DC Vario-Elmarit 24x Zoom Lens\n25-600mm Optical Zoom Lens (Equivalent)\n3.0\" 460,000-dot Intelligent LCD Display", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ60K 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 24x Optical Zoom - Black.
