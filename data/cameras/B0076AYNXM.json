Billon", "ReviewID": "REAYDEOYTM4V5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I know that the D800 is not really the replacement model over the D700.  Nevertheless, it did replace my old D700 and the D800 is, I believe, better suited for my photographic needs than the D700, i.e., studio, portraits, and landscape.The D700 was and still is an outstanding DSLR. The D800 is of course better, but in a very perceptible way, which was quite a surprise to me.I have done over 5000 shots since my purchase on 24 March. So far, no issues to report: no green cast from the LCD and no problems with the CLS system.Nikon has really outperformed with this new DSLR and the clear improvements are:- Much improved Dynamic Range, which was my main problem since my first DSLR- Better colors straight off the camera: deeper and richer- Better AF in low light ***UPDATE*** After comparing with older Nikon DSLRs, this improvement is minor and only perceptible on cross-type AF points.- Highly detailed photographs at full res, 100% magnification and also when down-scaling the photos.Let's not forget a proper and useable HD video feature at broadcasting quality. ***UPDATE*** Perhaps not broadcasting quality, but close enough.On the negative side (there has to be some):- The zoom in and zoom out buttons are reversed from the old models, which is now more logical, but I am used to the old wrong way!  it's a minor problem of course.- D4 has backlit buttons, why not on the D800? This can't be that expensive to include.- Very expensive Battery pack, this is a major drawback for me. But yes, the D800 is well priced at $3000. I just hate ridiculously priced accessories.- still wonder the point of having 1 CF slot and 1 SD slot. 2 CF slots would have been superb.  But I guess if you come from a SD card DSLR, that would be practical for you.- Left AF points can suffer from front/back focusing issues on wide angle lenses, but this can be fixed at a Nikon repair center under warranty ***UPDATE***One crucial point that has to be considered when acquiring a 36MP DSLR: storage will be an issue. I just purchased a 4TB ext hard drive. A 14-bit RAW file (uncompressed) coming from the D800 will average 75MB.I just shot a wedding, and I consider the D800 to be an excellent choice for the job.  All the complains about shots being more blurry at 100% magnification are irrelevant.  One has to be precise with his/her settings, at the right exposure and optimal shutter speed, results can be absolutely mind-blowing.  And since most won't need 36MP for wedding photographs, down-scaling images will certainly eliminate slight camera-shake or noise.One particular aspect that I appreciate is that my Nikkor 85mm f/1.4G is now tack-sharp at f/1.4.  I had a front focusing issue with my old D700 even with the fine-tune option set to max. Since I'm no techie geek, I still don't understand why the D700 gave me problems with the 85mm.Anyway, I used to be one of those people saying that digital photography will never replace film photography. The D800 has changed all that.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best landscape or studio DSLR available today", "Author": "Emmanuel \"ShutterMan\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZLAFD12435MV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "_*********************************************************** Update 04/15/2013: This update is for event shooters/photojournalists.** Enthusiasts, hobbyists, still life and landscape professionals can skip down to my original review below and call it a 5-star camera.**********************************************************After a year of ownership with three bodies, these are my final thoughts.  This is the best landscape or studio DSLR in the market.  Other than not having a mode dial with Custom User Settings (U1, U2) like the D7000, this camera has near perfect ergonomics.However, I do not recommend the D800 for paid work that have once in a lifetime moments, such as capturing the first kiss at a wedding or truly spontaneous moments, because there is a high probability of missing focus.  When situations have no do-overs, equipment inadequacies are not an option.  This is the reason why I stopped searching for a \"good copy\" of the optically superior Sigma 35mm 1.4 and settled for the more reliable Canon.I have had both bodies and a replacement body (serial 3041XXX) \"fixed\" by Nikon and they felt the last fixes were good enough.  Good enough, I did not invest $18,000 into a system for good enough!  Without getting into the whole left side autofocus (AF) saga, which is readily available on other reviews and websites, the AF is horribly inconsistent even with the latest firmware (A: 1.01/B:1.02) using the center AF sensor.My percentage of focused photos took a massive dive with this camera; I tried compensating by closing down the aperture a few stops, but the increase in depth-of-field area was not always enough.  With the D3/D700, I would wait for moments and capture it with one shot.  The D800 missed focus often enough that I began shooting in spray n' pray style, however, often the focused photo was not what I wanted.  Creating the dilemma, do I give the client a great moment that is out of focus by meters or a ho-hum moment in focus?  When I owned the D3 and D700, I used to shoot 500-1000 photos per event, I was taking 3,000-5,000 photos with the D800.  This MASSIVE increase of photos created a workflow nightmare and my quality of work suffered (subjects centered, ISO's in the 12,800-25,600 range to allow for smaller apertures).Autofocus problems only get worse when in AF-C, if shooting a person walking towards the camera at a slow to medium pace in the F/1.4-2.0 range, expect 1 out of 10 perfectly focused, 1-2 acceptable, and the rest throwaways.  Stop down to F/5.6 and at best it's 50/50.  I took a huge financial hit switching to Canon (selling used, buying new), however, my two Canon 5D MkIII's get 7 perfectly focused, 2 acceptable, and about 1 throwaway running the same test of a person walking towards the camera. Stop down one or two stops for near perfect results.Nikon does many things better than Canon.  In body AF Assist Light, intervalometer, spot metering based on AF point, intelligent Auto ISO, better AF position selector, better access to flash options, and many more.  Overall, less menu digging, and obviously Nikon's megapixel advantage is nice for cropping.The ten plus (I actually lost count) trips to Nikon service centers can attest just how much I wanted this camera to work.  Nikon customer service is beyond atrocious and their technicians are incompetent.  Maybe a few years into production, new D800s will be adequate, but I will never know because I do not see myself buying Nikon again.The Canon 5D MkIII's sensor has less dynamic range, 1.3 bits less color space, but those 24 bits it does have are beautiful colors that require less post-processing for nice skin tones.  Because I am confident that the AF will not miss, I am now shooting 300-600 photos per event, that plus less time in post.  My turnaround went from 4-6 weeks (culling missed focus photos and fixing color) to only 2-7 days with the inferior Canon.  My clients are happier because they are getting their photos fast.  In the end, I prefer focused images taken by an average sensor, than a blurred images taken with a sensor with all the dynamic range and megapixels in the world.BOTTOM LINE:The D800 is perfect for photographers that shoot landscapes with Zeiss lenses, people that like having subjects perfectly centered, or autofocus then recompose photos in the F/5.6-11 range.  However, if you shoot wide open with fast primes and not getting the \"shot\" puts yourself or company at risk, look into another camera.  If my livelihood did not depend on camera equipment, I would have stayed with Nikon.  However, in my line of work there are no do-overs, thus the Nikon advantages gave way to its faults, and after struggling with Nikon's abysmal QC and CS in recent years (SB-900, D7000, D300s, three D800's, 28mm AFS 1.8, 35mm AFS 1.4) and reading about D600 issues.  I will not be buying a Nikon for work anytime soon.********************************************** Original Review*********************************************Below are my observations after one month of ownership.Pros:-----+ Resolution:  Amazing detail when shot with the right glass and settings.+ Dynamic Range:  Incredible, when shooting in lower ISO's it is near impossible to ruin a photo.  Search the internet for \"fred miranda d800 review Yosemite\" to see real life comparisons.+ Color:  I recommend creating custom profiles using a X-Rite ColorChecker Passport Software or Adobe DNG profiler for better than Adobe LR colors.+ AutoWB:  Works well in about 70% of lighting scenarios, somewhat better than the D3/D700.  *** See Tip Below ***+ Low ISO:  Having a true 100 ISO is godsend for on-location lighting setups or shooting wide open in daylight.+ High ISO:  The D800 and LR4 do an excellent job in controlling noise.  Using PS plug-ins a properly exposed image can print acceptable 8x10's at ISO 12800 (max for D3/D700's is 6400).+ Tonality:  With a good camera profile in LR4, the tonal range rivals Fujifilm 400H Film.  This is incredibly useful on portraits with 4-1 or greater lighting ratios.  Posterization in the shadows (DSLRs Achilles' heel) is only noticeable on highly manipulated images.+ Handling:  The Auto ISO is easier to engage and the new position of the ISO button is more intuitive.+ Exposure:  Better than D3/D700, but far from perfect.  Contrary to Nikon's literature, it struggles with backlit scenes.+ Battery Performance:  It can get me through a full day's shoot if I avoid extensive LiveView or WiFi use, otherwise I need to use a backup battery.Cons:------ Software:  Nikon software can produce excellent results, but it is clunky and slow.- Handling:  Awkward placement of the mode selector button (to make room for movie record), lacking the D7000 U1/U2 style custom banks, switching of AF modes is not as effortless as the D700.- Autofocus: All 51 points are still too centrally located, no increase in cross-type sensors over the D3/D700, all the cross-type AF sensors are in the middle, like the D3/700, the outer sensors are near useless in low lit, low contrast situations.  * For more details on AF performance, see update above and commentsSummary:Using proper technique, the images this camera produces are superior to any camera I ever shot.  Would I jump systems for this camera?  If I owned a large collection of top-tier gear, NO!  Otherwise, I would consider it if I was not too invested.  Does it equal or better Medium Format?  There are differences in perspective, defraction limits, DOF, FOV, and CANNOT BE COMPARED.  Having shot Canon (AE-1, 630, A2, Elan II, 20D, 40D, 5D mkI & mkII, 1D's), Nikon (FM, F4, F100, D200, D300s, D7000, D700, D800, D3), Fuji (S3, S5), Mamiya (645, RB67), and Hasselblad (H4D-40), I know that they are excellent tools that are capable of creating amazing images.  Pick the one that best fits your needs and have fun shooting.*** TIP *** To improve WB (green cast), use the WB Fine-Tune (pg. 149) and shift Magenta 1 or 2 points or use a X-Rite Passport for every scene change.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unbiased Review of 5DmkIII vs D800", "Author": "se", "ReviewID": "R2CLT21Y0ULWTU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a Sony shooter with only a few lenses. I use to shoot Canon during the film days. I tested both the Canon 5D mkIII and the Nikon D800 and here are my results. I tested a 5DmkIII with a 24-70 f2.8 lens and a Nikon D800 (not D800e) with a 24-70 f2.8 lens.High ISO:About the same, except D800 has a lot more detail to work with. In Lightroom, I can save a higher percentage of ISO 6400 shots because the D800 has more detail. Canon seems cleaner initially in Lightroom but when the picture fits into a 24\" 1920x1080 monitor or a 64\" Samsung plasma TV, the Nikon looks a tad cleaner, noise less noticeable. I think the Canon looks cleaner in Lightroom because it is just a smaller picture. But displaying ISO 6400 shots on a monitor or TV, Nikon looks nicer in general. Both cameras at ISO 12,800 look awful and not recoverable in Lightroom. It might look acceptable as a really small pic but why the heck would you buy an expensive camera to display crappy looking pictures?Frames per second:Easy winner. Canon can shoot 6 FPS, Nikon 4 FPS. However, in practice I think 4 FPS is pretty good. None of these cameras are really Olympic style sports cameras.Resolution:Easy winner. Nikon's RAW files are more detailed, almost 3D like. I can't really explain it other than the pictures look more real. I can crop a photo to 1/3 it's size (12 megapixels) and it still looks stunning. I wonder how much better the D800e version is. I'll have to wait until my friend receives his to find out.JPEG:Easy winner. Out of the camera, the Canon JPEGs are phenomenal. The processing done is quite remarkable.RAW:Easy winner. If you shoot RAW, Nikon is it. Also there is an issue with the Canon with the color red. I think the color is overblown at times because all the details are loss and not recoverable in Lightroom. Not always but it has happened at least twice. The same photo on the Nikon kept all the details.Autofocus:About the same. Canon and Nikon have awesomely quick autofocus and I couldn't determine a difference. The only caveat is that Nikon focuses better in lowlight (without the autofocus assist lamp) and also the Nikon focuses when there is almost no light (with the autofocus assist lamp). Why the heck doesn't Canon include an autofocus assist lamp is beyond me. Also, Nikon's face detection is extremely useful because it focuses right on the eyeballs.Flash:Easy winner. Canon doesn't have built in flash. Nikon flash worked surprisingly well.Dynamic Range:Easy winner. Nikon knocked it out of the park. I got a lot less blown highlights with shots with white clothing and more realistic blue skys. Also, there is a lot more headroom on both the highlights and shadows on the Nikon when editing in Lightroom. How did Nikon have better shadows and highlights! They have to share some of that technology!Video:Suprisingly about the same. I would have thought that Canon's lead in video would maintain. Surprisingly, the Nikon's video was just as awesome as the Canon. Nikon's video has a bit more detail and is definitely a little sharper than the Canon. I didn't test Nikon's uncompressed HDMI out, although it seems to be a useful feature (this is like RAW HDMI output for video). Canon should adopt uncompressed HDMI out also.Price:Easy winner. Why anyone (who doesn't already have Nikon or Canon lenses) would buy this Canon for $500 more than the Nikon would need to think twice. I can see why the Nikon is selling so much better than the Canon, at least on Amazon.Comfort:Both about the same weight. Both feel nice in the hand. Canon possibly slightly more comfortable if you have bigger hands. Nikon maybe more comfortable with smaller hands. Both are fine though.USB transfer:Nikon wins with USB 3.0. Skipping the card reader altogether by just plugging in the camera to the computer is convenient. Also the transfer speed is much much faster than Canon's older USB 2.0. This saves a lot of time.LCD Screen:Canon has slightly better screen in direct sunlight (LCD facing up towards the sun). Nikon is better when the LCD is not directly facing the sun. Nikon's screen is crisper and more 3D like.Weatherproofing:My last day of shooting was in a light mist/drizzle. I was shooting both cameras again for about 20 minutes when the Canon 5D mkIII developed some fogging inside the viewfinder screen. I could not wipe it away as it seemed to be inside the camera. I could no longer take pictures normally without live view. Nikon didn't have this problem and I continued to shoot the rest of the day with the Nikon in the same wet conditions without issue. I had planned to shoot at least 2 weeks with both cameras so this was definitely a bummer.Lenses:Both Canon and Nikon's 24-70 2.8 lenses are great. I would say the Canon 24-70 2.8 is just a tad faster on focus. Nikon is slightly sharper in the corners. Both Nikon and Canon seem to have a very comparable lens assortment (although my wallet won't be happy buying so many new lenses!)Well, after using both cameras for about a week, I kept the Nikon D800 and returned my (possibly water damaged) Canon 5D mkIII. Both are phenomenal cameras but D800 has definitely outclassed the 5D mkIII in this round. Maybe Canon will come back strong with its next version. It definitely has some catching up to do.Thanks for reading my review and I'll also post this on the Nikon D800 and Canon 5D mkIII review page. Best of luck to all you photogs and enjoy these phenomenal cameras!", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Why I chose D800 (instead of D800E)", "Author": "K. Chua \"KChua\"", "ReviewID": "R17LL0ZHIZ3V7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(There are already many reviews on how this camera compare to the older Nikon D700, it's competitor: Canon 5D Mark III, so I won't reiterate)About me: Been using SLR for over 20 years... first 10 on film, recent 10 on digital SLR's. I've used Leica, Nikon, Canon SLR's... and I've longed to get the next full-frame (FX) camera after Nikon D700 (without referring it to \"D700 replacement\"). When the camera was finally announced, it came out like a pair of twins were born. The D800 and D800E are almost identical, and I wasn't sure which baby to choose. If you have the same dilemma, read on...Many people (myself included) doesn't seemed overly concerned that D800 is $300 cheaper, because many photographers are perfectionists and the hope that D800E offers sharper images makes it really tempting. But after after much research and comparisons, I finally chose D800 (no E). Why??? Here's my rationale:Eventually, the choice to get D800E instead of D800 hinges on trade-off between* benefits of greater sharpness, against* cost or risk of Moire (or unexpected patterns in the pics/video)Depending on what you shoot:* portraits, fashion, weddings, architectures, wide range of stuff => Go for D800* macro, landscape, tripod-mounted shots or those with time to position light/camera/subject => Go for D800EMoire MAY occur when you shoot repeated patterns, such as:* fabrics (on clothes)* glass or windows of buildings* straight hair of peopleOnce it happens, it's not easy to remove in photos (despite claims that a few clicks on Adobe Lightroom 4, or Photoshop). It's also more problematic in video, which I'm not sure how it can be corrected.As such, one camp of people would say they rather have sharper images ALL the time, and risk a small x% of time that they get Moire. That seems fine reason except that to get the sharper images distinguishable between the 800E and the 800, it's ALMOST ALWAYS due to other factors such as:1. lens (do you have the high quality glass)2. filter (high quality filter in front of lens?)3. ISO (if you shoot at high ISO, the noise will eliminate such clarity)4. f/stop or aperture (depth of field)5. camera shake (tripod?)6. how close you examine the photoTo detect the clarity difference between D800 and D800E, according to Nikon, you need to be shooting at 3 stops above max aperture of a great lens (usually f8-f11). Above this range, it negates the benefits of D800E. Furthermore, in order to see the difference, you need to pixel peep, and at the plane of focus.- I typically shoot with wide aperture for the bokeh and rarely are my subjects in the same flat plane- I usually don't look so closely at my photos, so that clarity is good to have but not criticalTo detect Moire, you can likely see it with your naked eye if the area is large. It can occur on a person's cloths, or a building or just railing beside your subject.- You can prevent this before you shoot by repositioning the lights, subject or camera. But it's a chore!- You can fix it after you shoot with software. But it requires the shot be on RAW format to be more effective! Also a chore!.If like me, you don't want to deal with these pre-production and post-production work and  just want to enjoy taking great shots of what you see, then I believe D800 is yours to buy. Precious moments are limited and I'd rather spend extra time capturing them than figuring out how to avoid or fix Moire. There are people with patience and care to fix all these, but I'm not one of them... and perhaps by then, another new camera would have been born - hopefully not a triplet this time. :)I've been toying with this new camera and will post additional comments soon...If this helps you better decide which camera is better for you, let me (and others know) by clicking the \"Is this review helpful\" below. I'm sure there are other reviewers out there who would give various viewpoint and hopefully this will add a valuable perspective as well.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "D800... AF is a big quality concern for me (after testing 3 units)", "Author": "B. Steele", "ReviewID": "R3QX1V3PG6VHA7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just received my pre-order Nikon D800 last week from Amazon.  The camera serial number is 3004XXX so it is not from one of the earlier production runs but also not from some of the latest being reported (3008XXX+).  Either way, the main reason I wanted this camera was to step up to an FX sensor with three fast prime lenses for optimal bokeh.  The lenses I have include the Nikon 24mm f/1.4G, the Sigma 85mm f/1.4 EX DG HSM, and the Sigma 50mm f/1.4 EX DG HSM.Unfortunately the D800 I received has the notorious left side AF problem that has been widely reported on in dpreview and other photograpohy forums.  Basically the issue is this... if AF-S focusing is used and any lens is set to f/1.4 the leftmost AF point in the viewfinder backfocuses significantly on the target.  Using the rightmost AF point also yeilds a noticeably soft focus compared to the center AF point (which is uniformly sharp).  I haven't tested focus accuracy in AF-C mode at f/1.4 but if it also uses the phase detection focus system of the viewfinder I suspect it will be unable to track subjects sharply once they leave the center of the frame.  If you search for Nikon D800 AF problems online you can see numerous example images posted.Many other users have reported AF problems but certainly not every D800 user has.  If there is a widespread manufacturing QC problem I suspect that many of those that haven't reported a problem either don't own any fast lenses, stay above f/2.8, or only use the center AF point to focus and as such don't know yet that their camera has a defect.  I would definitely recommend that everyone at least test their AF point accuracy to check this.  For me it is a potential show stopper.  If a $3000 camera can't focus accurately with all AF points with an f/1.4 lens it is useless for me and must be either fixed by Nikon or returned.  I currently have an open support ticket with Nikon US complete with sample images of the focus problem but have not heard back from them yet.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "The next legendary Nikon camera - Review against D700", "Author": "Herman Au \"Herman Au\"", "ReviewID": "R2SS3W0S00K9YN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used the D700 bodies extensively over the past two years and I've grown accustomed to them like my own hands. The D700 has been hands down the best DSLR I've used during its time.  I shoot weddings professionally and I almost always carry two D700 bodies on me - and thus weight quickly adds up when you carry the 2 bodies along with lenses and flashes, which makes it nearly impossible for me to use the D3/D4 series.  The D700 has been a blessing with the right balance of nearly everything.How quickly has time gone by and now the D700 is giving way to the D800.  Some say that the D800 isn't exactly the successor to the D700 - and after the initial tests of my own, I tend to agree.By now I'm sure you have seen countless reviews of this camera so I'm not going to bother telling you what's so good about it.Instead, I'll focus on the main differences comparing to the D700.My initial reactions holding the camera:- The body feels lighter, not by much, but definitely lighter- The grip feels different. Initially I think I still prefer the D700 grip better since the D800 grip feels fatter where your right index finger lies, not exactly a good thing for people with small/medium hands.- There is now an additional video record button near the shutter release button up top which is awesome,- but then that also moved the Mode Button which I often use, and they made the button smaller to make way for the video record button.  This will take a little to get used to.My initial reactions looking through the viewfinder:- The +/- indicators are inverted by default (inverted by the usual Nikon standard: + / 0 / - )- After a little digging it can be reversed in the Menu- There is now TWO virtual horizon indicators helping you level the camera rotating left/right, and tilting up/down - this is absolutely awesome and extremely useful.My initial handing the camera:- The 8-direction cursor button is more recessed, making it harder to accidentally hit the center button but I feel like the directional arrows are  a tad harder to press- They reversed the positions of the (+) and (-) buttons on the left side making it more like the newer DSLRs.  I'll be pressing the wrong button for a couple months before I adapt to this.- The focus mode button on the back is now gone, I accidentally pressed that old button on the D700 many times,- In place of it there's now a dedicated Live View button and there's an ambient light sensor next to it,- that sensor allows the camera to control the LCD monitor brightness automatically.  It's an excellent implementation and seemingly work very well during my initial testings.- The D700 mode dial on the left had ISO, Qual, and WB; while the D800 now has an addition of BKT (bracketing) button there also.  However they put BKT in place of ISO, and now ISO moved towards the back of the camera where there was nothing on the D700.  This again, is something that will take time to get used to.- The AF mode toggle is changed to more like the D7000.  The D700 has S (static), C (continuous), and M (manual), and this new one is either AF or M.  There's a small button on top of the toggle that you hold down to change focus mode - you use the command dial and sub command dial to change between AF-S and AF-C; 3D tracking, 9-point, 21-point, 51-point, single point.  I'll just have to say it's different. The good: you can see what you're changing through the viewfinder - I like especially the \"3D\" indication when you change into AF-C 3D tracking they used the 51 on the focusing screen to draw out \"3D\" which makes it very easy to see without having to look at the top LCD panel or digging into the Menu.  This is a huge thing 'cause now you can easily change focus mode without taking your eye off the viewfinder and actually see what you're doing as you change focus modes.- I feel like my eye has to aim a little lower as I look through the viewfinder, again something to get used to.- The lock button when not reviewing picture is now dedicated to Picture Control - making it much easier to access- The autofocus assist light is very very bright!My initial findings using the camera:- image quality is amazing- the RAW files are huge... I find myself handing 40-50MB RAW images and my 16GB CF cards are no longer sufficient- LiveView is very easy to use and going into LiveView mode is very responsive.- For some reasons shooting pictures in LiveView keeps the shutter open for 3 seconds even when I'm shooting even 1/50 sec, making it hard to recognize when exactly the camera is shooting. I'm rather confused about whether this is by design or is it actually a bug.- Dual card slot is a nice addition, but I'm not sure if I'll be heavily relying on this or not given the file size is already so big.  I may end up getting huge SD cards to have it capture JPG as a form of backup instead of having the SD also store RAW.- 16GB cards store roughly 200 RAW pictures from what the camera estimates, ouch.  This is based on 14-bit RAW files and lossless compression.- If you're wondering, there isn't a smaller file size for RAW images.- Battery is new, same as the D7000's.  Say goodbye to your old EN-EL3e and say hello to EN-EL15.- There's now a Quiet shutter mode, but I find it only slowing down the shutter open/close motion a bit but not exactly very quiet.Quick notes after using it on the field:- focus speed is on par with D700.  I think the AF-C 3D tracking works even more accurately.- viewfinder 100% coverage is very nice, but I noticed the 51 points are closer to the center comparing to the D700.  It's a minor annoyance.- The camera estimates 400 shots left on a 32GB card shooting 14-bit compressed RAW, but in reality after shooting 392 and it still estimates another 170 left.  My RAW files range from 38MB to 50MB average around 43 to 44 range. I have a feeling they'll tweak the estimation a lil better on the next firmware update.- ISO800 images are very clean, I shot a few at ISO1600 where I normally would have busted out my flash.  This is definitely a big step up from the D700.- The dedicated LiveView button is very very nice - using LiveView video mode is quick and easy too and it saves a different set of iso/aperture/shutter speed so if you're switching from photo to video and back you wouldn't have to readjust all your settings.- The EN-EL15 batteries lasted me the whole event without a problem just like the EN-EL3e did on my D700 bodies.- LiveView shooting does lag in an annoying as shown in the initial testings.  It takes a while for the camera to respond after shooting a LiveView picture.Final Thoughts:- 36MP is HUGE.  It may not be for everyone, but then again the D800 along with that kind of resolution at $3,000 definitely has its impact on the DSLR market.  Despite the difficulty handling large RAW files, it is generally a welcome additional along with its amazing image quality.  Image quality is absolutely stunning - DxO Mark rates it at 95 and calls it \"A full-frame sensor with no weak points\" for a good reason.- if you're wondering if there's different size for RAW, the answer is NO.  There is no small medium large RAW - RAW is RAW and it's always 36MP.- I hear some complaints about the placement for the video record button.  It's a little off from the shutter button so it's not the easiest to reach, but you can also set up the shutter button to record video in LiveView video mode.  Nikon definitely have it very well thought out implementing the video feature in the D800.- D700 users will have to take some time to get used to the changes in button placements, but nothing too drastic that might make it a deal killer.- The D800 takes a giant leap into the cinematography world with features that will bring tears to enthusiasts holding out for Nikon.  It is overall an amazing camera to use and simply another legendary Nikon in the making. It has taken giant leaps from the D700 but in my opinion a lot of it seems to be towards a slightly different approach.  It does feel a little different from what I would call a natural progression from the D700, and thus it does make sense to call it a whole new different product. Until Nikon decides to release a whole new full frame DSLR below the D3/D4 line in direct succession to the D700, the D800 will be the choice of many working professionals including myself for years to come.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Autofocus problems are a shame!", "Author": "jonnyz2 \"jonnyz2\"", "ReviewID": "R1K6FPX8J3MJUQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "By now many people have reported on the internet problems with Nikon D800 and D800E autofocus.  It is frequently reported that autofocus points on the left side do not work well.  On four cameras (two D800s and two D800Es),  I can confirm the problem!I have extensively tested four of these cameras (see testing notes below) and all four did not focus well when using the left most center focus point.  Because those problems were so pronounced, I decided to return the cameras and did not test the other left side focus points.  Internet reports discuss problems with those as well.It has been reported that the D800Es perform better than the D800s.  That is somewhat consistent with my experience.  The left autofocus points were worse on the D800s; however, I had one D800E with poor autofocus overall.  That same D800E also had a broken electronic release connector when I received it.  The other D800E performed better overall than the three other samples, but still not good enough.  All four have been returned.What happens?  Using standard autofocus, the camera will not focus well on the left most (center) autofocus point.  In Live View mode you can get good focus (either manually focusing at maximum magnification or by using Live View autofocus).  In side by side comparisons, Live View produces better results than standard autofocus.  In many cases the differences were substantial with standard autofocus not producing results that were acceptable.Internet reports suggest many of the left side focus points have problems, not just the left center one.  While that may be true, as I mentioned above, I did not test those on my four cameras because the left/center focus point off was enough to justify returning the cameras.For some people, not having the left autofocus working well won't matter.  For me, I regularly shoot vertical landscapes and other vertical compositions where the left side selective focus points are very useful.  I've been using the selective focus points on my D300 for years and find them quite valuable.  Taking advantage of them has become very quick and simple for me and it is a feature that makes me more productive.  So, I want them to work on the D800/E!There may be another serious impact of this problem even if you don't have that same needs as I do.  Internet reports suggest that the 3D focusing function of the camera will also be degraded by left focus points not working correctly.For those interested this is how I tested the cameras, here's the process:- Put three focus targets on a wall corresponding to the center focus point, the left most center point, and the right most center point- Take shots where the selective focus points are on the center target, the left target, and the right target.  Take four shots each with autofocus and four shots each with Live View (in other words, 8 shots per target, 24 shots per sequence.  Another way of thinking of it is 4 comparison sets per target and 12 comparison sets per sequence)- Repeat sequence at different focal length and camera distance- Repeat all of the above with a different lens- Compare results in Adobe Lightroom side by side with the Library view X/Y comparison tool- On my first two cameras I used manual focus for Live View and on the second two cameras I used Live View's autofocus (by the way, the latter is very good!)- I also experimented with using autofocus fine tune on individual lenses.  On the second two cameras (i.e. the replacements), I did all of the above and then repeated after setting the appropriate AF Fine Tune per lens.  AF Fine Tune, in some cases, seemed to reduce the problem.  However, I did not reduce it enough to make either camera's performance acceptable- So, this is literally hundreds of side by side comparisons across four cameras.Given the amount of reports on this problem on the internet, I suggest anyone wanting one of these cameras consider waiting until internet reports show purchasers regularly getting good cameras.Alternatively, if Nikon acknowledges the problem and guarantees new cameras don't have it or guarantees that they can fix it if one camera does have it, then I will try again and purchase another.  In the mean time, I'm waiting.  On the point of Nikon repairing the cameras, most of the online posts I have read indicate that Nikon service centers are not able to fix the problem at this time.For me personally, I was really looking forward to the upgrade from a D300.  I really do want the D800/E to work!  Instead, I've been really disappointed!Finally, a note on customer service...I purchased the D800s from Amazon and the D800Es through B&H.;  Both companies facilitated the camera returns and replacements.  They were both supportive and helpful and did everything a purchaser could want when dealing with such a bad situation.Nikon seems to have been silent on this left autofocus issue, and that has NOT been to their credit.  The good customer service provided by Amazon and B&H;, in dealing with Nikon's problem, does both companies credit!", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera with a problem", "Author": "W. Kurtz \"B. Kilgore\"", "ReviewID": "R360ALOPHWI0FS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It makes me very sad to write this review as I am a confirmed Nikon user. I had waited several months, like most people for my D800. I have read a lot of reviews that have praised the camera for its outstanding images and resolution and many that express frustration over the \"green tint\" and the \"left focus\" issue. I have not experienced the green tint but my camera does suffer from very pronounced issues with the left focus point. I will try to cover some new ground in this review that has not been covered in other reviews that I have read, mainly that when I say the left focus point, what I really mean, and I don't think that others have articulated this, is that it is the column of all three left focus points that are affected. At least that is true in my case. The center is razor sharp. I tested with a 24-70 at 2.8 and flash to remove camera shake issues. Nikon has asked me to submit samples and they were very nice about it. I am torn as to whether to submit the camera for repair or to return it.On the positive side the camera does pretty much everything else superbly. Great handling. Beautiful color. Responsive. It really does put medium format performance in a dslr form factor. Truly incredible.I know a lot of people have trashed the D800 with 1 star over this issue and I personally disagree with that. I think 3 stars is fair because this is not such a minor issue that a one star deduction would be appropriate, nor should it overshadow all the amazing things this camera does. I will own one at some point. It's just a matter of whether it is this one or one that is produced after a fix is in place. That all being said, the D800 is a complex piece of technology and the reality is that just about everything that relies on technology today requires adjustments. This includes everything from computer software to a Mercedes. I hope this review comes across as fair and balanced as I want it to be.====Update====Nikon looked at my images on Wednesday after I submitted them on Saturday which I think is pretty darn good turn around for a big company. The rep that I spoke with readily acknowledged the issue and immediately sent me an email with instructions on how to send the camera in for repair. I can't really ask for more than that. Yes, I would have liked for it to be perfect out of the box but Nikon is being very responsive and courteous. My only word of advice is to call them early or at off hours. In the afternoon the hold times can be long. I will update this review as things unfold.=======Update 7/24/2012=========I now have the D800 back from Nikon. I tested it today and while there is about a 65% improvement in the left focus point performance it does not match the focus of the center points. This is apparent to non-technical viewers who were asked to look at images on screen without being told which was the \"good\" one in advance. Each time the viewer picked the left focus point images as less well focused. They also felt that a left focus point image from the original batch prior to Nikon servicing the camera was less well focused than the new, post repair, left focus point images. On some images quite honestly I felt like I was pixel peeping and that the difference between the center and the left was quite small, while on others it was glaring. My concern is that for some portraits that it would be an annoyance. Just out of curiosity I mounted the same 24-70 on my old D200 and shot the same series of test images. What I found is that even on the D200 there is a perceptible difference in focus quality between the left and center. Again this was confirmed by a \"blinded\" subject. I have always been thrilled with the pictures from my D200. I have carried it on five continents and taken some of the best pictures of my life with it. I never noticed the \"left focus issue\". I think that there is a difference with the D800. Part of the appeal is the amount of detail in the image and the slightest imperfections in focus are more apparent than with a camera like the D200. Considering all of this and the fact that I really can't afford to upgrade my DSLR's less than every 7 or so years, I have decided to return the camera tomorrow and try another copy in the near future. As I said at the beginning of my review I am a dyed in the wool Nikon fan and my experience with the D800 has not been a great one. My D4 on the other hand is fantastic. I will be posting that review soon.========Update 7/25/2012========Returned original D800 today. Happened to check online to see if by some miracle a local Best Buy in the city had one. The one closest to me did not but one on the East Side did. I went and purchased it and brought it home for testing. Sadly it has the same problem. I ran basically the same set of tests on the camera and it had the same left focus issue. I not only showed the problem at f2.8, it exhibited the problem all the way to f5.6. This is why I have lowered my rating to two stars. If the camera worked as it should it would be wonderful, however in my limited experience it doesn't. I think I have given it every chance but to no avail. I am happy that there are people out there that have cameras without the issue. Just out of curiosity if you read this and don't have the left focus issue and feel like leaving a quick comment I would like to hear about your experience.I am not sure where I go from here. I really want a full frame Nikon that is lighter than my D4. I guess we'll see what happens at Photokina.============Update 8/9/2012==============The D800 is much more widely available now and so I tried a third body. It was initially out of focus in both the center and left focus points with my 24-70 wide open. This actually gave me hope that I would be able to correct the problem with the focus fine tune adjustment setting. I spent about two hours of trial and error attempting to find a set up that would bring the focus into razor sharpness. I even shot some test with my D4 and compared them side by side just to be sure that I wasn't looking for too much out of the lens. I finally had to give up. It just wouldn't work. No harm done because of good return policies. Just wish that I could luck into one of the D800's that don't have this issue.=========Update 2/2/13============Well I finally got a good D800. I checked the left focus on this unit with a 306 series serial number and it seems fine with focus. I am so happy. I again had a neutral party try and pick the photo that looked different and he could not identify any differences this time. I did have to apply a very mild focus fine tune to the 24-70 2.8 to achieve optimal results at both the center and the left but that is to be expected. +2 adjustment. I am going to add one star at this point to reflect that I now have a working camera. It was also nice to get the unit at 2799 instead of the previous price.

Brodsky", "ReviewID": "R1NHK5VNIKRII4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my D800 for less than 2 weeks and so far I am happy.  here is my backgroundI've owned D700 (several samples), D7000 (several samples), D300 (several samples), D90, D80, D40, D40s, D60 in NikonI've owned 20D, 30D, 40D, 7D, XSI, T1i, T2i in Canon.D700 is a brilliant camera, incredible AF, incredible low light shots, fast fps with grip (8),  scene recognition in auto mode, built like a tankD800 takes spectacular photographs in either JPEG or RAW.  the AF is at least as good as D700.  Scene recognition in auto mode is even better, it essentially focuses on the face.The worst camera from the top tier consumer and prosumers in terms of AF is D7000..  I have gone through several of them.  The AF Module on D7000 is inferior to D300/D700/D800.  D7000 was the only latest Nikon where I experienced AF problems in low light.  Never with D300 or D700.  D7000 - yes.  Problems with continuous AF when shooting White Birds on Contrasty Background - D7000 - YES,  D300/D700/D800 - no.The only things I am kind of not loving on D800 -  the AF switching was changed from D3/D300/D700 way to D7000 way , where you have to now press the button and scroll one of the two wheels and you have to think which wheel does what.  I liked the levers of D700, simple two levers controlled everything.  But I guess I will have to get used to it.  The second thing I am not happy about is 4FPS.  And the third is of course - the battery life went down significantly from D300/D700.Everything else, including the new Auto-ISO feature is brilliant.  it basically now accounts for VR in lenses, where you can control how aggresive auto ISO is depending on the lens you use.  If you don't have VR you may want it to select faster shutter speeds, if you do have VR, you can set it to select slower shutter speeds.  You can turn off Auto-ISO via the wheel without having to go into menu.5DM3 is a great camera too.  I think the AF is pretty similar.  AF has to do with not only the Camera but lenses.  The truth is that Canon's USM on their top lenses is just brilliant and they focus incredibly fast.  Just try the old 24-70 on any of their bodies.  Nikons' AF-S SWF is pretty fast but not as fast as Canon's USM.  On balance though, both 5DM3 and D800 will do brilliant job for you.This review is obviously only based on less than 2 weeks of use.  I will update it later as I get more experience with D800.EDITAnother couple of weeks went by and I used D800 more.  Loving the results.  I am starting to get used to new way of changing AF and it is working pretty good.  I took the camera to a very dark restaurant with 50mm 1.4G lens which everyone seems to be hating these days on D800, and got many great pictures in very dark conditions.  The only problem I see is that poor battery life.  I took about 500 pictures with very little live view and one or two short videos and my D800 shows only 33% of battery left.  That projects to me under 700 photos per battery life.  I was able to routinely shoot way over 1000 shots with D300, D700, and even D7000.

Now, after using it for a year it rarely comes to weddings.  One of the weddings I shot had a 12\"x16\" album. When I opened it up, the spread was 16x24 inches. Yes it looked lovely, but even that size was too small to see all the resolution of the camera.  I sat there with a 5 power magnifying glass and looked at each grass blade clearly, but for the most part it was lost on the client.  What was not lost was the each 64 gig SD card only took 800 shots.  I shoot around 2000 images at a wedding.When you put on good, clean glass and mount this body to a tripod you'll get images that are every bit as good as a medium format negative.  With a high quality, large ISP monitor you'll see things with this camera you've never seen before.  I'm sure I could find even faster memory cards and learn to adapt my shooting style to use this at weddings.  But to me, it's too special.  When a dear family friend needed 28 faces photographed in one family portrait, a first and last time for many years to come  this is what I used.  The blow up was nearly 40\" wide and 16\" tall, I could make out people's eye colors.If you do a lot of portraits and a lot of retouching this is a great camera to own.  If you do landscapes and commercial it's also a great camera to own.  IF you shoot weddings and work on speed and volume of images, it's a bit too much.  I used to think that no camera was too good for a wedding.  I'm a guy who dragged around a Mamiya RB67 to a wedding at one point.  For larger, more elaborate weddings I have used this for portraits and slide back to my D300 for everything else.  Unless you like buying 2 terabyte hard drives every few months for storage you may want to keep this as a portrait camera and leave it at home for weddings.  The money dance doesn't need 36 megapixels.  Yes, you can turn down the resolution but you're wearing out the shutter just the same.This is like the pair of shoes you're supposed to wear to work but they are so nice that you save them for special occasions.  The D400 whenever it comes out will be my new go-to camera.  The D800 is the camera I use when I want to take my time and make art.__________Update: 11/26/2013For reasons still unknown to me my commercial business continues to grow.  The D800 is the camera of choice for my commercial jobs.  It's a bit interesting to say but I can very much see differences between lenses with this body.  I've been using a 135mm AIs lens (yes, old school) and at F11 there is nothing sharper.  Portraits where you can see every pore of the skin as clear as day.  Simply amazing.  If you can get your hands on a 105 f2.5 AI or AIs shoot it close to wide open with available light.  This lens design is based off of the the Zeiss Sonar lens that you'll find on Hasselblads.When you hold the D800 it feels substantial in your hands.  It's just very nice to hold and to use.  It's the one camera that reminds me of my film days.  It faintly reminds me of my F3 but gives results much like medium format.I still stand by initial review, the D800 isn't really a wedding camera.  It's also not a first camera I would buy.  If this is your first DSLR get something like a D7100.  The D800 is a great second body that  you take out on special occasions.  My D300 is beaten down and it's just nice to have a nice, large clean camera like the D800 available for special shoots.I haven't had focusing issues per say like others have experienced.  So far I feel it focuses faster and better than any other Nikon I've worked with except for the F5.  The thing that turns me off a bit to the D800 is the old 65nm image processor.  Canon has moved onto ARM image processors and Nikon has only introduced them in the new Nikon One line.Perhaps the  question that most people will wonder about is that they are thinking of buying a D7100, but for about $800 they can get into an FX body  (Nikon 610).  And for $1000 more they can have the D800.  I shoot with by DX and FX cameras and lenses.  Day in and day out the DX line is my bread and butter.  I'd say buy the D7100 and wait to see if Nikon updates the D800 in the next year or so.  The $1800 you save not buying the D800 can buy you one impressive zoom lens or a few great quality prime lenses.  The 35mm F1.8G lens from Nikon is around $200 and it will be a lens that will make you a DX believer.  But then again it comes down to what you shoot.  If you are retired and take nice vacations and you want to pack as many megapixels than by all means jump into the D800.  If you're younger and the D800 is going to stretch out your finances start smaller with a DX body.  I don't think I would appreciate the D800 as much if I had only shot FX.

I received it back in March.  From the beginning I could tell something was wrong with autofocus but it took a long time to determine I had the left focus sensor problem.  Anyway, I shipped it off to Nikon, they shipped it back in the same faulty condition. Since I was on a shoot in California, I even paid steep overnight shipping charges.  They did not return the favor and just shipped it standard ground back to me. Repeated calls to Nikon has resulted in no action.  I am heavily invested in Nikon equipment so can't just \"switch\" to another brand. I really can't fathom that MY Nikon, whom I've used since 1978, would turn out this way. The camera makes great pictures when in Live View (which I don't use), is missing the standard things we all ask for (pre-sets, SIMPLICITY in controls), but Nikon's complete failure at customer service keeps me from rating this camera higher. If this doesn't change, at some point I will divest myself of my professional Nikon \"kit\" but I can't afford to replace it right now.

I have a range of fast/pro grade lenses.  I focus mainly on landscape and [natural light]portrait. I also do quite a bit of street photography.D800 is long awaited and fit in nicely the criteria of FX sensor with the size of a D300S.There are many positive reviews of how good this camera is, and I agree.For this \"review\", I will not go through the pros and cons, the pluses and minuses of this camera.  Rather, I want to share the experience of jumping from low [12] MP, fast frame rate DSLR to one with 3 times the resolution and much slower frame rate.To manage camera blur, the rule of thumb that we were taught is to make sure the shutter speed is at about 1/focal length of the lens.  If one uses a 50mm lens, the the shutter speed should be around 1/50 of a second.  It could be slower if the lens has a VR.This rule of thumb does not work well with D800 due to the very high MP.  I didn't know that before.The first day I had it, I shoot it in a public park.  I used it with a Nikkor 50mm f1.4D.  It was a cloudy day, I shoot with base ISO of 100, Aperture prior at F/2. and my shutter speed at that time was about 1/30s.  The images at 100% was blurry.I bumped up the ISO to 200 and increase the shutter speed to 1/60s.  Still blurry but better.I gradually bumped up the ISO until it reached 400 and shutter 1/125s.  Only then the shutter speed is fast enough to stop the blur.The next day, I used it indoor with a volunteer model.  I used a SB-700 flashgun with a Nikkor 85mm f1.4G, aperture priority at F/4, and the camera selected a shutter speed of 1/60s.  Most of the images at that shutter shutter speed were blurry.  With the experience the day before, I bumped the ISO up and increase the shutter speed to 1/160s before the blur subsided.I discussed this issues with a few friends who also own D3X, they confirmed that based on their experience, it will be difficult to handhold a high MP DSLR without the shutter speed at least twice the focal length of the lens (i.e., 1/[focal length * 2]).  I did a few more testing afterward and learned that to be absolutely free of blur, the \"new\" rule of thumb for minimum shutter speed without causing a blur when using a D800 is 1/[focal length * 3]. In layman term, if you use a 50mm lens, your best bet of having a perfectly sharp image is to shoot with a shutter speed of 1/150s.  Of course, with VR, it can be slower.This camera is better suited for certain situations than others.  For landscape photography where we tend to use a tripod,you will not have the blur problems as I mentioned. But for street photography where you tend to handhold, just need to watch out the shutter speed.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera! Please do not pixel peep", "Author": "KD", "ReviewID": "R2R7UBTSI1ZJYA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first state that this camera will not make you a better photographer. Not even close. It may even make you a worse photographer. Why? because the hand shaking that was forgivable before will now be more evident at 100% zoom. Wait, why are you pixel peeping a 36MP camera? For pixel peepers, avoid this camera at all cost! I'll explain more below.The beauty of a high megapixel camera is that it makes your pictures better at the same megapixel size as your last camera! Let me explain this, for most lens, sharpness differences can be viewed at 100% zoom. Unless you print at gigantic 36MP, which only a very small percentage of pros will be using, it's moot. Now, when you downsize a picture, the pixels are interpolated. Lens that were previously unacceptable at 12MP all of a sudden look pretty decent at 12MP downsized from 36MP! For example, a picture that was taken with slight motion blur at 100% pixel peep will disappear when I re-size it to 12MP. That's the thing, most will not print a 36MP picture at 36MP! You will have to resize it to make prints! It's pretty insane to upload 36MP JPEGS to make 4x6 prints anyway. Although someday, I will hang a 36MP picture on my wall.So what's the purpose of getting a 36MP? First, high ISO noise will be interpolated out of existence when downsized. Second, blurriness will be sharpened out of existence when downsized. Third, your not so sharp lens at 100% will look pretty darn good downsized. You need to compare the pictures produced at the printed size and not at 100% zoom! If you take a picture of your face and zoom in at 100%, it'll be pretty unflattering with all the pores and stuff. Same concept here. So if you buy this camera just to view pictures at 100% zoom, you will all be disappointed because that simply is not the point.Coming from a D90, these are the things that are better.1. Full frame. Your 50mm prime now has a real 50mm FOV rather than a fake 75mm FOV.2. Bokeh. You get to see more of that 50mm FOV which means the bokeliciousness that were lost on the D90 is now there. The further you go away from the focus point, the softer the bokeh is. When the DX picture is truncated, you lose that bokeh. This is why full frame appears to have better bokeh.3. ISO. When downsized, my ISO 6400 looks like ISO 100 on a 12MP. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little...but not by much.4. Sharper image with the same lens. Yes, at 100% zoom, all the short-comings are there to see. At 12MP downsized, it will look very great.5. Cliff Mautner looking pictures. Yes, I went there. I've always looked at those nice midday pictures where Cliff take pictures of his models in front of a green background (trees) and the model's faces has that cool looking rim lights... yeah, I can replicate that! Except his models are better looking. Is this due to the better sensor or the better imaging processor?6. Better dynamic range. When the sun's beating down on you at high noon, dial the exposure compensation down -2EV, shoot without flash, and then fix the under exposed parts without blowing out highlights. Tada, natural light at high noon without flash! Very nice, Nikon!I have no green cast. I have no out of focus focus points (that I know of). My beep on focus function is broken. I turn it on, but it doesn't beep. I don't know why. At 100% zoom, my prime doesn't look that sharp at F1.8 as it does at F4. But I don't care. If you want a camera to test out lens sharpness, this camera is it! But don't blame me if you proceed to throw them all in the trash to buy sharper lens.Is this a better camera than the D700? It depends. Is it worth the $1300 premium for the added functionality? Is a $3000 Channel purse worth $1300 more than a $1800 LV purse? A purse doesn't even take pictures and you sure as heck can't downsize it on command! And yet my wife buys a new one each year. For me, yes it's worth it! I'm referring to the camera, not the purse. Then again, if you were reading carefully, I previously own a D90 not a D700.As a final note, I'm going to read more books on photography because this camera tells me what I'm terrible at it. I look at the pictures on Flickr that people took using this camera, then I compare it with my pictures, all I want to do is to punch myself in the face. If I become a better photographer as a result of owning this camera, then I guess the $3000 is worth it.This is the Internet. Feel free to tell me I'm idiot and that I'm wrong in the comments.Update 6/23/12: (1) The beep issue was resolved by deleting bank A and then use bank B. Unfortunately, my camera has the left focus issue. Most of my lens are fine, however I borrowed a friend's 24-70mm and the left most focus definitely has a problem on this one. In liveview, it works fine. I'm going to wait a few months to see what Nikon says about this before sending it in for repair.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "batch #303xxxx still has the left AF point issue", "Author": "Alexey \"Alexey\"", "ReviewID": "R232I9L7P29RD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Batch #303xxxx still has the left AF point issue. No green tint though, at least to my eyes. Good that I've bought this warranty that came with it, this should cover shipping to Nikon for calibration.Update: turned out that Squaretrade warranty doesn't cover items that were defective from the start, so that goes back to Amazon.Update: I've got a replacement from Amazon (very fast by the way) and the camera still has the same left focus point issues. Serial # is 3036xxx, so its basically the same batch as the one I've tried before. Though I've only tried 2 bodies, I have a feeling that all of these D800s are the same, including the D800Es. The reason why not everyone notices it is because its not that bad in real-life and you can see it clearly only under controlled conditions and with a fast lens wide opened.That being said, I'm keeping the camera. It's great otherwise, and I'm hoping to get it fixed some time in future when I send it out for sensor cleaning. I still got that Squaretrade warranty thing that should cover it. Nevertheless, the 3-star rating stays, because Nikon needs to pay more attention to their quality control, and that's the only way I can help it happen.Update: I have noticed oil particles on my sensor and had the camera shipped to Nikon for cleaning and calibration.

That being said, there are a few things I have noticed which there don't seem to be much feedback on which I would like to highlight. For point of reference I am coming from a D700 and have many of the high end FX lenses.One of the absolute best improvements (aside from obvious things like resolution, improved DR etc.) is the Auto ISO feature. Am I the only one who loved this on my D700 and love it even more on the D800? Nikon has tweaked the min shutter speed setting on this so it is a little more intelligent. Instead of just saying 1/50 or whatever you want as the min (this would be a decent setting for a wide lens) the D800 takes it 1 step further and allows it to float relative to the focal length. In other words 1/50 with a 200mm lens might be a little low in my opinion but the D800 will set it to 1/200 (following the 1/ FL rule). Furthermore, you can tell the camera to set it faster or slower (there are 5 levels with the mid setting as 1/FL) so the same 200mm lens will have some multiple (or fraction) applied to this as well. I like the one step up setting so my 200mm lens never shoots with a shutter less than 1/400. This makes it so much easier on longer length lenses and especially zooms like the 70 - 200 where you might jump around and going back into the menu is a pain to set the min shutter each time... Call me lazy but I love this feature - great addition.EDIT: After shooting 2,000 shots or so with the D800 (and especially with any longer non-VR lenses) I see why this feature has been added... With the D700 the 1/FL rule seemed to work just fine, especially with VR equipped lenses (most non caffeine junkies can get away with far less). With the D800 this rule just doesn't work as well and will produce mixed results. With a D700 and my 24-70 I would shoot at ISO 100, 50mm and 1/50s all day long. On the D800 I have found it is better to go to 1/100 or even a little higher with ISO 200 or higher - the ISO change is a lot less noticeable than the increase in sharpness due to the shutter. With the 14-24 this \"new\" rule (haven't decided yet if the new rule should 1/2*FL or 1/3*FL) isn't too hard to follow but with the 70-200 I find myself pushing the ISO frequently of changing the setting down a bit due to the presence of VR (I use the VRII model). I honestly would not have guessed that the increase in MP would require this much of a change in technique but it does. Of course you can always downsample and still be better off than where you were with the D700 so don't take this as a negative to the camera - just a required change in technique in my opinion. When I first wrote this review I loved the new feature and I still do now but there is one change they now need to make: Recognize VR equipped lenses and allow conditional rules such as 1/2*FL with VR and 1/3*FL without. None the less I just change the setting in \"my menu\" when I use a 16-35VR or 70-200VR (although the longer one can sometimes benefit from just leaving it) and the end result is the same but Nikon made it 90% of the way on the new feature, why not round it out. I did also pick up a grip and use rechargeable AAs simply to add weight & this also helps but D800 + grip + 8 rechargeable AAs + 70-200 is not something I walk around with for hours on end.Other more minor comments:- This is less about Nikon as it is about Adobe but it caught me off guard: LR3 will not read D800 RAW files nor will it ever! You either have to use a converter (add more workflow steps which is unacceptable in my opinion) or upgrade to LR4. I suppose I can see both sides but it is annoying to say the least. Adobe should really support this in LR3. It made me want to use Aperature instead but I also use PCs so that is just a pain.- Built in HDR is a joke. Any respectable HDR shooter will bracket with at least 5 frames and likely use Photomatrix or something similar. It also does not work if you shoot RAW - only JPG and only 2 images hence the joke. Your probably not buying the camera for this anyway.- The quiet mode is also useless. Fractionally less noisy than the std and a waste of a spot on the dial.- The + / - on the image zoom is backwards from the D700. Just takes some getting used to...- Folks, it is a 36mp sensor; you will need a bigger drive and 16GB cards barely scrape by now. I am finding 14 bit lossless compression files in the 50mb range - directly after a format the camera reads 200 available images on the 16GB card. A 2GB card is like an old roll of film now for 25 \"exposures\" LOL. I get that wedding shooters are going to need a lot more bigger drives but you can't have more detail without more space... Yes, people say you can downscale but this poses a serious workflow bottleneck for me. I have also found that in addition to more drive space working with these large files, particularly in PS & HDR SW with a dated dual-core 2.4GHz CPU and 4 gigs of ram in 32 bit mode requires patience. I hate waiting. EDIT: I have underestimated the PC side of the equation on this camera upgrade. I had to buy a new computer with a lot more muscle to handle a 7 or 9 image RAW stack to be sent to Photomatrix. These get really big and processor hungry. I got a PC with dual quad core (8 total) 3.2GHz XEONs and 16GB of RAM. The processors are far more important than the RAM I have found so get a faster processor and 8GB if you must to save $. It costs as much as a nice lens or even a bit more but keep in mind it is used for every image I take... Worth the upgrade in my mind and something to consider if you have an aging PC / Mac.- 100% viewfinder vs 95% on the D700 doesn't sound like much but it is really a welcome improvement.- I have now started buying SD cards to compliment the CFs I already used with my D700. For whatever reason tests I have done on my computer show I am getting faster write speeds out of a 60mb/s Sandisk EX Pro CF card than I get out of a 95mb/s Sandisk Extreme Pro SD card. Same manufacturer but the CF cards just seem to be faster. They are also more expensive - go figure.- I have never owned a D7000 but I hear the auto focus settings (selecting) are the same on the D800. It is way different than the D700 and took me 10 minutes just to figure out how to adjust from AF-S to AF-C. Hint: it is on the front (the side button) to the left of the lens when looking thru the viewfinder.- It has been said before but the fact that this thing has similar high ISO performance compared to the D700 with 3x the resolution deserves a slow clap from Nikon. Really, impressive. I have no issue with using ISO 1600 in auto ISO mode and for certain types of shots see little downside to 3200 unless you are seriously pixel peeping.- Their product launch and way they rolled this out and so dramatically underestimated demand is the exact opposite. Once you have one (a good one without some of the early mfg issues) though you seem to forget all the frustration of the wait.These are just the initial impressions since I have only had the camera for a week or so and shot < 1,000 images. So far very impressed thou and would do it again in a heartbeat. Lastly, in case you are also wondering, I have since cold my D700. Given it still has amazing value I just could not justify it as a backup body and there were few if any advantages that I could really see. I can see wedding photographers scooping these up though as they are a great balance of performance and file size if you are getting into the 4 digit file counts per shoot.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, astonishing details!! ...updated", "Author": "Stefan Georgiev", "ReviewID": "R160ZCZ9QZJ0LN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You all know what the specs of this camera are. I won't lose your time with that. I have the camera for about 20 days and here are my impressions so far.In the beginning I was very upset by the Mpx number. After just the first shoot, I have to tell you - I don't want to have a camera with small resolution any more. Period!The level of details is astonishing! The images are excellent even straight from the camera - with no edit at all. The dynamic range is excellent.Also the AF is very good. It literally sees in the dark. I tried to take pictures in dark room at night (no light - all lights turned off) and the AF assistant light was enough to focus, without even hunting. I wasn't able to see ANYTHING, because it was complete dark, but the camera did. Daytime I never experienced any problems with the AF.I believe the fast AF and details level are also determined by what lens you use (and I have really good optics), but I do compare with D700 and D7000 and there is significant improvement.I like the ergonomics. It's comfortable to hold, even for quite long time. I like the screen resolution, but it does have that slight greenish tint (if that's bothering you it can be changed in the settings).The only things I don't like are:There is a slight noise even in low ISO values - 400 and above, but it is only when you look at 100% and the noise is very fine grade, extremely easy to remove in LR.I would also like to see some more customization options for some of the buttons - like I never use the WB (well almost never) and since I shoot RAW, for me this is quite useless button.I currently own the Sony NEX-7 and I'm impressed with the level of customization of that camera. You can do all your settings just with your thumb - A, S, ISO, etc. I really would enjoy to see at least some of this on D800.Overall, D800 is a dream camera - I highly recommend it to everyone!~~~~~~~~~~ Update 1 ~~~~~~~~~~~ (after 4 months of use):Lowering my score to 2 stars.I do not change my mind on what I've written before about this camera. Everything is correct, except with one - the AF.I said I didn't have problems with my AF, but surely now I do.And it's the commonly spread left AF points problem.I did not discover it in the beginning, because I rarely use the very left AF points. Few months after the camera was on the market, I started to read reviews, describing this problem, but since I haven't experienced those, I neglected to test myself. Until one day, when shooting outdoor I saw my images come extremely soft and blurry (with 24mm 1.4G lens). I tested with the 16-35mm - same thing. 50mm 1.4G - same. I had inconsistent problems with my 85mm 1.4G lens while ago, thinking first that it is caused by backfocusing. After I talked with the technical department from Nikon I realized that this could be caused by the fact I was shooting kids, and you never can be sure how fast they move, etc.However - this was something different now.I now remembered what I read about the left AF points and when I got back home, I decided to test myself. I downloaded some charts, put those on the wall and started testing my D800.It clearly had problem with AF when the left points are used. The problem is bigger with wide angle lenses at big apertures(small numbers) - especially  with 24mm at f/1.4. It fades away after f/5.6-f/8.And as you switch from wide-angle to tele lenses it also fades, even at big apertures.That's why it is not very easy to discover the problem, until you don't fell in a situation like mine, or just decide to test your camera in the beginning.I contacted Nikon, sent them multiple pictures and they requested the camera for check.I'm waiting now (already about 10 days) and meanwhile reading the latest review from Mansurov's website (how the guy received his camera with fixed left AF, but they screwed up his center AF, which is worse). I hope it will be different with my camera and everything will be ok, but I know Nikon from before - it's not easy to deal with them when have troubles with your equipment.So wait for my second update, once I receive the camera back.Until then my score is 2 stars....and it could go either way..~~~~~~~~~~ Update 2 ~~~~~~~~~~~ (after 3 weeks in Nikon's service center):I can say the camera is repaired in general.I did the tests again and it's fine, but you can still see small difference in sharpness when use left AF points (more top left now, than middle and bottom), but it is acceptable, keeping in mind that this is visible ONLY with my 24mm at f/1.4.At f/1.8, f/2, etc. it is sharp. With the 50mm at f/1.4 is sharp now too.There is another issue though - the pictures taken with LiveView are sharper, than the ones taken using the viewfinder. I'm sending the camera back to be fine tuned.I'm also changing my review to 4 stars - this is otherwise awesome camera, but there are still few issues! Hope Nikon will do a better QC next time.~~~~~~~~~~ Update 3 - The last one ~~~~~~~~~~~ (after many months of use):I'm raising back my score to 5 stars.

First, Amazon, I am very disappointed with this $2999 purchase. I ordered mine on May 28 and received it on July 6. To my surprise, it was an opened box (used, or most likely returned) unit! When I first opened the box, I found the packaging bags were cut open, things were loosely packed and obviously NOT new. The first picture that I took showed a shutter count of over 1000! (and the file name did not start at 1 either). Besides that, the camera (serial number 3018xxx) clearly has left focusing AND LCD green tint problems! Refund!The next day, I went to a local Best Buy and bought the last D800 they had there. At that point, I still had the hope that... well may be the left focusing and the LCD problems are only in a small number of units from the first batch of production. When I got home, opened the box, examined the camera (by the way, this one was brand new. Serial number 3016xxx) and finally tested the AF. And to my dismay, this one had the exact same problems!! Left focusing and LCD green tint. Extremely disappointed and I returned it immediately.From the online forums/blogs, many people thought that those problems are only in a small number of units. Unfortunately, I believe the problems are in a lot more units than people think. Some people are not aware of those issues, some people don't know how to test, some people test with wrong lens/aperture/distant, some people say they don't use the left focusing point or wide aperture and ignore the problem, etc. I love Nikon and I was looking for reasons not to return it too. But after researching online and seeing inconsistent repair results, I concluded that it was the best to return it. I am aware that some people got lucky that some Nikon service centers were able to fix those problems, but I also notice that there are many reports saying their camera came back without fixing or being worse. Let me tell you, no one really know if these problems can really be fixed by firmware updates or even recalibrate/realignment, no one knows how big this problem really is.

My camera came with a free backpack, 32gb SD card, and $200 rebate and 2% rewards and free shipping!People say you need to use a tripod and Nikon's best lenses on this camera.

The other three were refurbished cameras, direct from Nikon USA.  They all developed oil/dust on the sensor that could not be controlled, and required wet cleaning of the sensor (something I'm not competent to do).  This final camera from Amazon has a much higher serial number, so I know it is of more recent construction, evidently Nikon has worked the bugs out, as this camera throws very little dust on the sensor (there is some).To test your D800 (or any DSLR) for dust/oil on the sensor, follow this method:1)  Set your camera to A at f22 - use a 100mm lens on manual focus, set it to infinity.2)  Call up a blank white screen on your computer (I use MS Word)3)  Hold the camera about 2\" from the screen and take a shot.4)  Take the file into Photoshop and select \"auto smart fix\" under the enhance menu5)  Look for spots!If you see more than three large spots or 20 smaller spots, your sensor has more than normal amount of debris on it.  Look fo dark, round spots that have a lighter colorered halo around them.  These are oil spots. Irregular or comma shaped spots are just dust.  Repeat the process after cleaning the sensor with a rocket blower (following manufactuer's instructions!).  If there are still spots, your sensor needs to be cleaned.

Nikon was preparing to take on Canon & medium format at the same time. When I starting looking to upgrade my 5D MK2 of course I looked at the 5D mk3. However I never followed Nikon much and did not know about the D800/D800E. So it just popped up on screen while searching some online stuff about the 5D mk3. When I saw the specs I thought it was too good to be true. So I watched many videos, and looked at many photos. After reviewing all these things I decided to rent a D800 with Nikkor 85mm, and 50mm 1.4G's.I was completely blown away! The image resolution is unmatched! There isn't a camera or DSLR under $12k that even comes close to this resolution and package! After rental time was complete I listed all my canon gear and lenses and purchased a D800E. I will write a review for the D800E on that page, you can view that one over there. The D800 has no moire issues at all. I shot landscape, portraits, clothes, indoor, and buildings. I shot wide open, and 14-24mm and never had any issues. Focus was great, my rental did not have any negative issues whatsoever.If you are looking to get a new DSLR this is the one to get! If you are shooting Canon like I was, then it is still definitely worth the switch!Video Mode: The video mode has a histogram instead of a EV meter, which is actually more accurate. I love the D800 for video. It is FANTASTIC! It has clean HDMI out!! It has a CF card and SD card slot, you can use them as duplicate, overflow from one to the other, or one for photos and one for videos. The D800 has built in HDR mode and timelapse as well as bracketing of up to 9 photos!! It can also go from 1/3 of a stop up to 2 stops between each exposure! WOW!Time lapse photos can also be turned into a 1080p/720p movie!! In the camera! Nikon has really delivered the goods this time around!

Before receiving my camera from YM Camera in Boardman, Ohio...I was coming from my tried and true D700.  I took my 32GB CF card (a 133x Sandisk) and put it in my D800.  I shot RAW + Fine JPG on my D700 and it was adequate with a 133x card....but not for the D800.  The 133x worked, but man was it slow!!  I ended up breaking down and purchasing a 64GB Sandisk Extreme Pro card (633x read (95MB/s), 600x write (90MB/s).  That certainly solved my problems with writing to the card...and on a SD card nonetheless! I did a test of how fast the 64GB Extreme Pro card could keep up with my camera. I always shoot RAW + Fine JPG, but for a test I set up my camera to 14bit JPG only...which averages about 20mb per JPG. In 4 FPS burst mode (the max of the D800 in FX Mode), it took my camera over 3 minutes to run out of buffer space. The card was able to keep up with writing to the card almost as fast as the camera buffer could go.  I was blown away.  It was like having a backup buffer in the SD slot.2.  Battery life is definately something to take into consideration, especially if video is used often.  I am able to go out with my D700 and a fully charged battery and shoot pretty much all day and not touch my 2nd battery. That is not the case with the D800.  Having a 2nd and/or 3rd battery is essential, especially when a lof of video is used.  Make sure to price check around.  The camera shop I use, [...], has the batteries on hand for $69.99, while Amazon has them for around $100.3.  I preordered my D800 from my local camera shop, and within 2 and a half weeks, it was in the store.  If you are intent on receiving this camera ASAP, it wouldn't hurt to drop your local camera shop a call to see their ETA.  YM Camera was getting about 1-2 D800's in per week, and at the time, I was 3rd on their list. Seems like I was able to side step the long waiting line at Amazon.  I purchase a ton of items from Amazon (and only review the ones that I feel deserve a 5 star rating), but this is an exception.4.  I have on hand my 50mm 1.4, 14-24 2.8 24-70, 2.8, 70-200 VR2, and a couple of other lenses on hand.  One thing I will be looking for is a 2.8 lens with VR on it.  I don't usually mind a little of hand shake with video, but this camera gives such great quality videos, that other little aspects start to come to the forefront...such as an unsteady hand.  I am considering the Nikon 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G ED VR AF-S Nikkor Lens, but may hold out if/when Nikon releases a 24-70 2.8 with VR on it.  The 24-85 might be just a bit slow for my taste.  I can get by with what I have available to me at the moment, but down the road, something with VR will be nice to add to the collection.5.  An external mic may be a nice accessory to have with the D800 also.  When using AF for video, it is easy to hear on the video.  I don't have an external mic yet, but I hope it would reduce the lens AF when video is used.  In a quite setting, it is easy to hear.  Our family went to an amusement part with our 3 year old daughter last week, and the AF noise wasn't as prevalent due to crowd/ride noise in the background.  But like I said, I don't have an external mic yet, so I am not sure if that will aid in reducing the noise from the AF mechanisms.What an incredible camera.  Coming from a D700, I would have to suggest upgrading to a D800 only if your finances allow.  It is not worth going into debt just for a D800 upgrade.  If your profession or desires leave you on the fence and the finances are available, it is well worth it.  Nikon has an engineering work of art here.  I can't commend them high enough for the quality of product the have produced for the average/pro consumer.

In general, I like the camera, but it turns out to be very high maintenance.Pros- First, the resolution and dynamic range are superb.  No DSLR does better.- 100% viewfinder coverage is a big advance over the D700- USB 3.0 transfer speed is very welcome for shooting tethered- Improved controls layout- HD video capability is great- Dual card slots- The high ISO is slightly better than the D700/D3 in spite of the 3x resolution jumpCons- Build quality; I have both the \"soft left Auto Focus\" and the \"inconsistent center Auto Focus\" issues.- Poor Nikon Support; Nikon tech support closed both of my support requests as solved without a resolution or even any sort of comment!  This is the worst support experience I've ever had for any product.- Battery life is really bad.  A heavy shooting day will easily burn through three batteries.- Poor third party support.  For instance, as of this writing, Adobe does not support tethering to Lightroom 4, Camera RAW for D800 NEF isn't very good and there are no lens correction profiles available. Eye-Fi cards don't quite work properly.- Many CF cards that worked fine with the D700 are not compatible with the D800.- Two handed feel isn't as good as the D700.  The thumb ridge on the grip has a lower profile, making the camera a little less secure in the left hand.  Grip space for the right hand is almost non-existent.I've been a Nikon shooter for 40 years.

My first body worked great, but it had the problem where the leftmost focus point was out of calibration.  This is a common problem with the D800 that can be adjusted by Nikon, but it's not a big deal.  I stupidly saw Amazon had more in stock so I figured instead of sending the body in for adjustment at Nikon, I would just exchange it for a new camera body.  The second body still has the out of calibration leftmost autofocus point, but I just wasn't going to worry about it.  I went to shoot a wedding with the new body, I couldn't figure out what was going on.  Do you know how frustrating it is when you are in the stress of a wedding and your camera is acting up? When I was fairly close to my subject everything seemed fine.  However, I had the bridal party far away so my brides head was only about the size of an autofocus point.  It kept focusing on the wall behind the subject.  I immediately saw what was happening on the camera screen because I was shooting at f1.4, so it was really a problem.  I thought I was just not aligning the focus point on my subject.  But I kept trying, it just would not focus properly.  I couldn't figure out what was going on so I just switched to my D700 because I didn't have time to mess around.  What I finally figured out must be happening, the autofocus points are misaligned.  The focus sensor is at a slightly different spot then what is shown in the viewfinder, so as long as my subject filled more of the view, I was fine.  But if I was trying to focus on a small subject it focused on a point above where I was aiming.  Anyway, I've decided just to return the D800, and wait until next wedding season to buy one when the bugs are worked out.  This would be a fantastic camera, but it needs some more time for Nikon to get the quality up.Update: Wow, I realized I never updated this review.  After getting a more recent build of the D800 I've been using this camera now for I guess about 1 1/2 years.  I've made a lot of money and taken a lot of beautiful pictures with this body, so I really love it now.  It still seems to have some quirks with the focus, but I think the super high resolution combined with normal issues with phase detect autofocus at long distance that it's just something to have to deal with as a professional.

I have been into SLR photography for more years than I can always remember. My first SLR was a Canon that I bought used in 1967. As soon as I could afford a Nikon, I bought a Nikkormat FTN...in 1972. I have shot Nikon SLR ever since.In 1999, I decided to be an early adopter and buy a digital camera. After a lot of soul searching, I bought a spiffy little model made by Fuji. From the first day of shooting with that camera, I was hooked. When my first Fuji died, I bought another one...but I soon grew tired of point-and-shoot digital. I wanted to get back to SLR shooting. In 2005, I bought a Nikon D70. Before I could even break it in, my daughter took a liking to it, so I gave it to her and bought a D80.By 2009, I was ready to move into serious digital photography. I bought a D300. I was so impressed with its capabilities; I bought another one so I had a backup in case anything failed. Well, nothing ever failed, and I was able to capture some great images with the two D300 bodies.In January of this year, I was able to get my hands on a Nikon D700 for a few weeks. That was my first full-frame DSLR. Fortunately, all of my lens except one was professional grade Nikon, and they all worked well with the D700. The image quality was superb and the low electronic noise allowed me to shoot under conditions I had avoided with my twin D300 bodies. During those few weeks, I decided full frame FX was my next move up in Nikon DSLR. However, I decided to wait until the rumored D800 became available.I pre-ordered a D800 the second day orders could be placed, and I received the camera at the end of April...just days before leaving for a photo trek to Arizona. With the help of D800 owners in the Nikonians user group and our trek leader who already had a D800, I was able to capture some great images in the AZ slot canyons. I shot single frames as well as high-dynamic range (HDR).When I got home and started to process the images, I was blown away by the details and sharpness of the images. I found that I had to upgrade several of my image software products to get them to take full advantage of the 36 MP images that came out of the D800.It has now been about six weeks since I received my D800. I have gone through a steep learning curve during that time. I have also started over several times with the menu and switch settings on both the camera and my Nikon lens. I have found that almost all of my lens work even better with the D800 than they did with any of my previous Nikon camera bodies. I did have to abandon a non-Nikon wide angle zoom that was designed for DX camera bodies. I also had to give up the use of Vibration Reduction (VR) use on my 200-400mm f4 lens; it simply would not work right.I now get greater details in images that are tack sharp with a wide dynamic range. I can print images at least 24 inches x 36 inches without using special printing software. I can also crop down to about 10 percent of an image of a bird or animal, and still get a nice image that I can print or put on the web.It took a lot of work to figure out how to get the best out of the D800, but in the end, it is worth every minute of that time.Update June 23, 2012:After a lot of testing, I have found that the VR issue with my 200-400mm lens is being caused by the lens...not the D800.

It is all true.  I am a serious amateur who upgraded from a D90.  Just be prepared for the fact that your $3,000 investment can very easily turn into a $10,000 spend if you want to take full advantage of your new camera.  Why?  Because if you are upgrading from a DX format camera you likely need 2-3 new lenses (easily $4k and a breeze to spend $10k).  And you don't want to just strap any mediocre lenses on this baby.  You need pro-grade lenses that can match the image quality the D800 delivers.  And then you very well may need a NEW COMPUTER.  My 5-year-old high-end Dell just did not have the horsepower (read - 60 seconds+ to open a single file!  Times 500 files in a typical shoot???) to process in Lightroom the 40meg RAW files that this camera will deliver.  Don't underestimate how big these files are and how much processing power is required to edit them!  That cost me $3,000 for a new computer. If you don't already have high end lenses and a high end newer computer then budget accordingly.  Otherwise you really are better off sticking with your current camera.UPDATE - Also consider the fact that you will be carrying much more weight and bulk because the D800 and better quality lenses are also heavier and larger.

Amiri", "ReviewID": "R2MHNVDVI27OSK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Waited three months for this camera. It received such amazing reviews and testimonials I was thrilled when it finally came. Unfortunately my copy also seems to suffer from the apparently growing left point Auto Focus problem. When you focus on the subject (flat and parallel to camera sensor) with the AF point in the center everything is fine and sharp, but if you take the same shot moving only the AF point all the way to the left, rack the focus on the lens and re-focus with AF, the subsequent picture is noticeably blurrier and out of focus.  I tested this several different times with different subjects on my old Nikon 28mm f/2.8D, which is by no means a jewel but still a good lens. Others have reported the same problem with newer 24-70mm lenses for example. I called Nikon, and they'll only admit that people have called about the same issue, though they won't admit it's a problem yet nor have they mentioned anything about it. This doesn't really make me feel cozy, but I understand, they know it's probably not something you can fix with a firmware update, and it's a not a problem that happens with casual, more amateur usage. Seems to me they're just playing the waiting game to see how bad it gets before they do something about it.  Other people on Nikon and various other forums have speculated *perhaps* 1 out 10 cameras could have this problem, while some speculate ALL the cameras that share that particular auto focus module have this problem to some degree. The thing is that since it's not a feature that's used often, and since the malfunction is more pronounced with wide, fast lenses, many people won't even know the problem exists on their camera. It might not be a big deal for some people but personally for my style of photography this is a real bummer. I use that feature often in landscape and architecture photography, which this camera is theoretically especially good for. Unfortunately that kind of subject and 36 megapixels makes accurate focusing especially CRITICAL. I really don't have confidence in the Auto Focus ability of this camera and the fact that Nikon's customers have become their beta testers, making us take pictures to prove the problem exists to Nikon before you can send it in for repair is not good practice, they should be doing their own Quality Conrol. Not to mention that people have sent their D800s in for repair, only to find that it either wasn't fixed or the left point was fixed but then the right and middle points were out of whack. And yes, perhaps I don't need auto focus for what I'm doing, but when I pay $3000 for a product I expect EVERYTHING to work about it. Period. Because of this and because of Nikon's non-stance on the issue I have returned my D800 like others have and will be waiting for Nikon to officially admit this is a problem or buy the D700 till the next model comes out or till new batches of D800s are confirmed to be working %100. After the green cast on the LCD, the camera lock-up during playback, wireless transmitter problems, meter display issues after installing firmware update, etc. etc. something tells me maybe I should wait on this one.There are many forums, threads and articles online, including videos, from professional photographers, that show the problem is very real. Michael Tapes and Ming Thein are two that come to mind. I tried to include links to them but Amazon won't let me, but a quick search for 'D800 left point Auto Focus problem' will give you the information you need. Here is a quote from Falk Lumo's blog about outer AF sensor accuracy on the D800.\"We conclude that the issue with the accuracy of the outer AF focus points of the D800 is real and probably affects all units out there to some (varying) extent. It is said to be pronounced at ultra wide angles. However, we found it to be (just) unacceptable at 24 mm as well. We guess that every camera with the \"Nikon Advanced Multi-CAM 3500 FX\" auto focus module is affected, i.e., D800, D800E and D4.\" From Falk Lumo, a conclusion that was reached from SERIOUS, accurate and extensive testing, the results of which you can see on his website and LumoLabs.Caveat Emptor", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad Left AF on Two Bodies", "Author": "Michael from NY", "ReviewID": "R33YFA9EQZVIP9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I placed an order for the D800 back in early March and was really excited about this camera.

Sure enough my copy had the problem.  It would back-focus on a subject that was about 10-15 feet away by about 5 feet.  When using Liveview to focus, it was spot on- a clear sign there is a problem.

The ergonomics are terrific (typical of Nikon DSLRs), and it has full manual control - with live previewing, of aperture, shutter speed, and exposure compensation during Live View video mode. This is a GREAT camera for video enthusiasts or pros. Keep in mind that some reviews mention the moire patterns that occasionally occur during video or still capture, which I haven't noticed yet but do not anticipate to be a deal breaker based on what I've seen. The D800 focuses easily in very low light and the high ISO noise levels and color rendition are among the best of any camera - from any maker, at any price. It has a top shutter speed of 1/8000, flash sync up to 1/250, and an exceptional level of customization via menus and function buttons that is a step up from the D600, which is nearly equivalent in image quality. The only real downside of the D800 are the massive files. The resolution is really too high for most users needs. A single RAW file is about 50MB! There are good solutions to dealing with these large files, however, and I posted a full review of the D600 vs. the D800, with sample images and a workflow solution for the large D800 files on my blog if you want more information. KevinKubotaBlog dotcom. After working out a good post-processing solution, I am very happy with this camera and the stellar image quality and pro feature set. Nikon D800 36.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera is in another league", "Author": "sunnycal", "ReviewID": "R1UL78T5UCPNH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shooting with Canon 5D Mark II since it came out. Prior to that I was using Canon 5D. So I have a long history of using full-frame cameras in the opposite camp. Sure the 5D series had limitations, but so what, the images they took rivaled medium format film (not digital). Then came Nikon D800 and D800e, with specs out of this world. Nikon packed everything that they had; their best sensor, their best meter, and their best AF in this package, and that for a very reasonable $3k.I ordered this camera on Amazon the night it was announced; both D800 and D800e. While Amazon delayed shipping I got my camera from elsewhere, then eventually I got deliveries from Amazon. Including the cameras I purchased and borrowed from friends, I have now played with half a dozen camera now. So what I say below is not based on my experience with one camera but all of these.1. Image Quality.While Canon 5D series rivaled medium format film, images from D800/e rival that of from medium format digital. So much has been written about the shadow details on this sensor. In addition to that I can pull down highlights much better than anything I used before. I can increase contrast, reduce contrast, increase saturation, increase sharpness to crazy levels and the raw files just take all of it in strides without breaking a sweat. I want to specially mention the color response. On my previous cameras, I could play with contrast and color only so much before getting noise or color shifts. I have not seen any such thing happening on D800. The sensor is truly next generation.2. MeteringOn my canon I am used to adjusting exposure compensation all the time. As I am moving around and changing subjects, I am always adjusting exposure. Nikon's newest color metering is so good that I have actually reprogrammed the camera so that the Main command wheel sets ISO instead of exposure compensation. This is because I haven't had to adjust exposure often. Canon supposedly has similar metering in 1Dx but not in 5D Mark III which inherits the meter from 7D.3. AutofocusDue to color metering feeding into AF tracking, the AF tracking is much better than what I have seen elsewhere. Single point AF, at least with the lenses that I have, is a bit slower then I am used to on Canon.4. High ISO;In my opinion, this camera has 1-stop better ISo performance than my Mark II. The ISO 3200 on 5D Mark II is about the same as ISO 6400 on D800. I have taken pictures from this camera at 25600 ISO. Some thing I have never done before. At normal print or display sizes, the pictures look exceptional. Of course, if you enlarge to 100% you will see high ISO artifacts, but remember that 100% images seen on 96 DPI monitor are equivalent to huge mural sized prints. So it is unfair to compare the 100% output of 36MP sensor to 100% output of 12MP or 22 MP sensor. I have uploaded an ISO 25,600 picture in imagesThis camera breaks new ground in 35mm picture taking and therefore has garnered significant criticism from people who either wanted this to be perfect or are trying to defend other brands. I will address some of these below.LCD Color Cast: I did notice this on the first D800 that I received but on the most recent ones it seems OK. On the first one that I saw this, it was not a big deal. I had Canon 5D for two years which also had a color cast on LCD but I had not problem living with it, partly because I shoot Raw.The reason for color cast is mostly related to Auto WB. It is easy to change the Auto WB to have a magenta bias, which should take care of green tint.Left AF Point: Depending on ow you test it, you can find some fault with extreme AF points in single AF mode. In my testing this issue was only visible when testing on wide-angle lens, I could not see it on 50mm or longer lenses. Nevertheless the left most point, on some cameras, seems to be off, sometimes. On a whim I tested the left-most point on my 5D Mark II also. It was way off! I had never noticed it and no one ever complained about this specific point. FWIW, the camera has 51 AF points. Even excluding the left-most point, you get 50. In real life, what will happen is that you will use either on of the center points, or if you are shooting in portrait mode, then rightmost point. The use of left point is rare and will mostly be in continuous AF mode in which case no single point determines AF accuracy. Anyway, I hope that down the road Nikon will be able to adjust this point.  If you do have to use that location, switch to Live View and use contrast detect AF, which is very good (better than Canon), which brings us to the next pointLive View: Here most of what others have said is true. Live view has many problems. It skips lines, so 100% or higher view is very annoying, the screen blacks out after every pictures for 1-4 seconds while image is written to card, using manual focus in dark settings is difficult because the camera always stops down the lens. These are quite annoying things and all I can say to Nikon engineers is, what were you thinking? Unfortunately the first two problems I mentioned are bad hardware design and I doubt that these can be fixed in the firmware. The last problem however is relatively easy to fix. In fact the camera already does that. If you put camera in AF mode, and press AF_ON button, you will notice the LV screen light up for a moment as camera opens the aperture to full to do autofocus. Then it goes back to darkness. I think it will be fairly easy for Nikon to add a mode where the aperture stays open until the actual picture is taken.I must say though that AutoFocus in Live View works extremely well in normal and low light. It is only Manual focusing which is the issue.Custom Settings: Canon 5D Mark II (and III) has three custom settings mode. You can register all camera settings (including exposure, and ISO) and just switch to the appropriate setting when you need to. All your settings will be brought back exactly no matter what you were doing. Now for me personally, this is not very useful, because I have at least half a dozen use cases and Canon only provides three. Nikon provides zero. It is however, important for some people and so they have been complaining. My own main beef with Nikon is that no matter what you have your custom shooting modes saved to, when you do green button reset, the camera resets not to the settings I saved, but to some stupid factory defaults. This is contrary to what an experienced photographer (for whom this camera is intended) would like to do. I set my camera to the settings that I want (e.g. Full Raw, ISO 100, Aperture Priority). Then I may change settings as I shoot (increase ISO, change WB, etc). What I would like to come back to is the settings that I painstakingly selected, not the factory default. If Nikon would fix this flaw through firmware update, my productivity will receive a noticeable jump.Compared to the positives that this camera has, these are minor nitpicks. Yes, these impact usability of camera in that the operation becomes slower, but none of the above prohibit user from doing anything that they want to. This camera is above all about Image Quality which it provides in buckets full. The images that I print from D800, even at 8x10, are noticeably different from other cameras I have used before. The edge acuity on details is phenomenal,and the tone curve is very different. One can always get high contrast pleasing images from most digital cameras, including D800. However where I see the difference is where more artistic and/or realistic representation of tone curve is needed. This is where D800 really shines and leaves all competition in dust.As good as the camera is with its superior IQ (resolution is just one aspect of it), metering, and AF, this is not a be-all, end-all camera. This camera is not for:1) Sports ShooterThis camera is not a speed demon. Although it is rated at 4 fps, you can get 5 fps (6 fps with grip) if you choose to 1.2x crop. That is right, Nikon only advertises high fps for 1.5x crop, but choosing 1.2X crop, you get a 25MP camera that can shoot at 6 fps (same as the 22MP Canon 5D Mark III). Still, dedicated sports shooter expect 8+ fps, which this camera is not capable of simply because it has so much more data to move.2) Event PhotographersPeople who shoot lots of pictures in a session (e.g. photo journalists, wedding photographers shooting thousands of images per wedding), probably don't need the super high IQ, and burden of processing 36Mp images maybe too high.3) JPEG ShootersAlthough you can get good Jpegs out of D800 with correct settings, I believe that those who shoot jpegs most of the time, won't see much (if any) benefit of this camera.I will end this review with comments for all nay Sayers:For Nikon shooters, D800 represents 300% jump in resolution. Do not compare it to D700/D3/D4 AF, sharpness, ISO, etc. Learn to shoot with the high resolution and the demand it makes. If you can't, downsize the files to 12 or 16Mp before comparing.For Canon shooters, chill out. Canon has essentially recycled the same FF sensor that they first released in 2007 in 1Ds III. Class leading at that time, and even until this February 2012, it is no match for the new technology in D800. Sadly, in past few years, Canon has been relying on their DIGIC processor to provide image quality gains in jpeg output. That is fine, and works for certain type of photographers, but not for many others who shoot Raw. The RAW output of 5D Mark III is no different from 5D Mark II (or 1Ds III). Sure the 5D Mark III has better (much better) AF and handling. However the purists photographer, lusting after IQ, have lived with 5D and 5D Mark II even with their poor handling. So improvements in handling and performance are meaningless unless they are accompanied by corresponding gains in the raw Image Quality.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "I think I will eventually be happy I bought a pair of D800s", "Author": "Philip Long", "ReviewID": "R23WXDAM8ZE58U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In mid to late 2011 I decided that I would move to FX primarily (and m4/3 for lightweight/portable).  I had been using a pair of D7000 bodies semi professionally, but good as they were there were problems that just got in the way.  The primary one is the depth of field control the larger sensor allows.  A close second is lens availability.  There is no 16-50mm f/2.8.  The 70-200mm f/2.8 is too long at the short end on DX for event work.  There are no PC-E lenses.  The options for 16mm are very limited and awkward, even with 3rd party lenses.  All of which is unfortunate because the D7000 handles pretty nicely especially with the grip.  I had used a D3 and D700 as stop gaps while I tried to settle on a D4 or D800 (or D700 or D3s or D3).  I wanted good video as a possible option; I wanted the new generation AF system and controls etc. etc.  Just all the little things that would be better about the new generation compared to the old, so I pre-ordered both a pair of D4s and D800s, the D800s from Amazon on Feb 7.  While waiting for them, I canceled the D4 ... basically, the frame rate wasn't something I needed and the flexibility of using the D800 without grip + the extra pixels won out.  Especially at a $6k discount!It's been a decidedly mixed bag since. On one hand, the handling, image quality, and low ISO performance, cropping flexibility are everything that I hoped for and more, there has been a lot of friction as well.I had a trip to Yosemite scheduled with me departing May 13.  Though Amazon estimated delivery by April 30, and mid April  I contacted Amazon to confirm the estimate, the bodies didn't show up until May 14.  Splitting CF/SD slots is annoying.  One or the other, eh?  $450 for the battery grip is grating, even if you have become accustomed to Nikon's gouging on accessories.And now, the cherry on top, the dreaded left focus issue.  On both bodies.  I had been driving myself nuts trying to figure out why some of my pictures were OOF.  I have pretty good technique and usually get good hits.  My subjects move sometimes so I thought that might be it.  Something was bothering me and I couldn't figure out what.  Then I ran the test and >.< two defective bodies.  I had hoped to exchange via cross shipping the defective D800s Amazon delivered to me.  No luck with that, the window apparently closed June 14 so July 17 is right out.  They did inform me that I could contact Nikon.So I did.  I'll just say that the tech rep I spoke with there wasn't too impressed with my plight.  Suggested that I upload some test shots to \"my nikon\" and in 2 or 3 days someone would get back to me, and we would go from there.  If it needed repairs maybe in 2-3 weeks I'd get my bodies back.  Renting 2 D800 replacements for 3 weeks while Nikon fixes the defective units they produced would be north of $1000.  Not impressed with the help I'm getting here, especially from Nikon who messed up big time.So I have a product with lots of spectacular qualities.  And lots of downsides.  And not a lot of help from the manufacturer when I run into trouble.  If felt better about other aspects of Nikon beyond the engineering the D800 is a 5 star product, hands down.  As it is, if you buy one you have to buy the Nikon organization too, at least after 30 days.*** Edit *** There have been some posts questioning the left sensor focus problem.  I have posted to flickr the test I conducted on a tripod with a cable release and lit by flash; you will notice that all of the live view and the right phase detect sensor produce acceptable focus; the center phase detect is marginal and the left phase detect sensor is awful.  This was try for both D800s I purchased from Amazon.  As of 7/23/2012 I am still waiting to hear back from Nikon.  A downgrade from 3 stars to 2 seems more likely.*** Update 8/1/2012 **** Changing review from 3 stars to 2 stars.  Nikon didn't even look at the photos I sent them before yesterday.  Then all they did was email me back stating the photos had been \"edited in some way\".  They hadn't, but apparently Nikon considers NEF->Lightroom->JPEG editing.  So I tried to upload the NEFs.  But their web application won't accept the NEFs their own camera generates!!!!  I uploaded the nefs to my own website and sent them a link.  I asked them to acknolwedge.  They didn't.  I called and the support said they were \"after hours\" and couldn't help me because HQ had the case.  HQ still hasn't responded.  It's ridiculous;  The images show what Nikon has seen many many times before now.  Left phase detect sensors that are badly calibrated.  They are making me jump through hoops for what purpose rather than telling me when they will fix their defective product.  Beware buying Nikon the company along with the body.  It's really too bad that they managed to royally mess up such an otherwise excellent product with their \"support\" culture.*** Update 8/17/2012 *** I received the first one back from NikonUSA and with some quick testing the focus seems to be spot on.  MUCH better across the sensors than previously.  Also, NikonUSA is being responsive to my concerns.  Back to 3 stars.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "A serious machine", "Author": "A. Rubin", "ReviewID": "R1MXKDDVMYT5W3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a D90 for several years, and have been very happy with it. I decided to get the D800 to take advantage of the larger sensor. Have taken several hundred pictures, and I can definite tell a big difference in the sharpness and detail of every image, even when using Small size (I think 9mp) or even in DX mode. I even wonder if it's *too* sharp sometimes, at least for portraits. I've mainly been using the 50mm 1.8 AF-D lens, which works very well. The autofocus seems very fast, faster than the D90. Here are some comments coming from the D90:-Definitely feels much heavier, even with the little 50mm AF-D. Notice my hand getting tired. The size doesn't seem much bigger, but the weight for sure.-Lots to learn about the layout of the camera. Many of the buttons are in different places, so it's a new learning curve. This is no big deal, just be aware that there is a lot to re-learn.-It's a real bummer that I can't use (to full effect) my great DX lenses. I normally used the 35mm 1.8G on the D90, but it was nice to have the 18-105mm for when I wanted a zoom, or my 18-250 when I wanted everything. Those zoom lenses were pretty good. An equivalent zoom for FX is quite a bit more expensive. Also lenses show much greater distortion on FX than DX, so I am a bit nervous to drop money on a new zoom (24-120, 24-70, 28-300, etc.). So if you are upgrading from DX to FX, think about the lenses -- it's not just that you need better glass for this super camera, but that these FX lenses tend to have their downsides. And it's not just distortion, but other flaws (falloff, vignetting, etc.) that can be more of a problem for FX.-Compared to the D90, the viewfinder is definitely bigger, and the LCD is is much sharper. There are also more choices of retouching effects on playback compared to the D90.-In the crop modes (DX, 1.2, 5:4) the viewfinder stays the same, but a black box appears to show you what will be in the image. Took a little getting used to, but I actually find that I like it. I use the crop modes if I find FX is too wide. Saves cropping later.Also, some might be curious to know how big the files are going to be. Here are the file sizes for jpegs, using the FX mode (the crop modes will have less megapixels and smaller files):-Small (about 9 megapixels): Fine quality is 5.5 mb, Normal is 3.3 mb, and Basic is 1.5 mb.-Medium (about 19 megapixels): Fine quality is 10 mb, Normal is 6 mb, and Basic is 3 mb.-Large (36 megapixels): Fine quality is about 17 mb, Normal is 9.5 mb, Basic is 5.2 mb.On a related note:-The Raw files are in the 40 mb range.-If you want a smaller image to email or something, the camera will make a smaller copy (there are several options for sizes).A very impressive piece of technology.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is leaking oil or lubricant onto the sensor", "Author": "johan", "ReviewID": "R3HWM3C98T19RC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It is leaking lubricant or oil on the 2nd replacement body.... see update below!1st I did was to test the left focus to see if I have the problem as some people reported.  I tested it on all 6 Nikon lens (24mm (D), 60mm (D), 85mm (D), 300mm(D), 17-55mm (DX, G) and a 24-120 zoom (G)) and am glad to find out that i don't have any of the issue that others mentioned.  It is either Nikon had fixed it or the problem is lens related.  (Likely through the lens data...)The detail record on D800 image is just incredible.  (I don't really think I need a D800E to see that)  The movie capture quality is really good when paired with a VR lens for personal use.  However, the size and weight of lens + camera have made it hard to pan it for the video purpose.  The focus in movie mode is relatively slow compare to the photo mode and made a lot of noise that is audioable in recording.  I ended up using a monopod with quick release and a external mic for video shooting and it helps a lot.  On the photography side, the high ISO capability of the D800 has greatly improved over the D200.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the D800.UPDATED 4/27:It is unfortunately, the the image sensor has the infamous oil deposits on it.  It is not easy to see when doing a still images.  However, when shooting video footage it became very easy to see when panning the camera around bright sences.  I had order a replacement from Amazon... Buying from Amazon is probably the safetest way to purchase an expensive item.Updated 5/1:I have received the replacement camera body. Checked the autofocus on the left and right on all my lens. I can't detect any issue.  Pointed the camera to the bright lamp with f22 to check for any oil spot on video footage. I didn't found any oil or black spots but surprising I found a batch of dead sensor.  On video footage it is like a firefly flashing red and yellow. The dead pixel can be verified on the full frame still picture also, once you know where to look for it. 30 minutes later I deceided to check it again before I pack it up and send it back Amazon.  To my surprise, it is not showing up in the new video footage I inspected.  The only possible explaination is that the imaging sensor of the camera was not working properly earlier. (electronically or mechanically)  The body was quite warm as it was baked inside the UPS truck under Flroida sun.  I have decided to keep it for now.  However, I would have to take the chance that those pixels may have shorter life span than the rest of the sensor.updated 5/04:After a 2 second high speed continuous shooting (4 fps of total of 8 shots), both the black spot and oil spot appear on the image and video footage.  The built in low pass filter cleaning mode could not remove neither spot.  The solid debris appear black against background.  The oil or liquid spot will appear bright against background with dark hallow around it.  It is very clear when shooting with small aperture, f/11 and up.  It is a design flaw to have thin low pass filter that allows dust be so close to the focus plane.Final verdict 5/27:I have decided to keep it. The picture quality is good and video performance are also quite well.  I end up buying a couple lenspen sensorklear to clear the new found oil spots.  To minimize the risk of sensor contamination, it makes every lens change an uneasy task.  No zoom while in live view.  Turn off live view immediately when not in use.  Limiting continuous shooting (CL or CH).  Prepare to clean the sensor yourself.  If you can live with all that, then you should be fine with it and be a happy purchase.

I am therefore an obvious LOVER of this camera. I shoot in urban and natural environments pretty equally, and I cover macro to landscapes and everywhere in between. Recently my work has focused on portraiture and birds as I struggle to improve my eye in other fields. Mine has a few oil spots on the sensor due to similar problems voiced regarding the D600 and D800. I need to have removed, which will cost me as I don't have the cajones to do it myself, and I am still giving this thing 5 stars. This hopefully gives my review a bit of perspective:While I always recommend people do some serious research before they buy a camera, this is different. Unlike the majority of Nikon DSLRs and point-and-shoots below this one, there are no scene settings, no auto setting, no standard automatic setting calibrations built in... this is just a really really legit camera with base functions that mimic an old Nikon film SLR (with MUCH better ergonomics). Leaving aside the full, 35mm (FX) frame and insanely high-megapixel sensor, this is a camera for someone who takes great images and actually knows how to use a camera. It is not for people who take great photographs on auto with their cell phone or point and shoot (you guys, look at the D600). If you are at that stage in your photography where you are ready/need this camera, you will know it. You will just feel it. Not only that, but you will actually know about cameras and a review like this is essentially useless, repeated information. When that happens, do whatever you can to buy this camera.Bear in mind that the only thing you don't get with the D800 that actually counts in a high frames-per-second rate. If you can get around that and know what you are looking at here, you honestly can't go wrong. Put the battery grip on it and it is far better than any camera I have ever used both ergonomically and functionally. I do include the D4 in that conversation, mostly because my work finds greater benefits in the D800's high resolution vs. the D4's speed and processing power.In short: if you feel like you want/need this camera and are ready for it, don't hesitate. If you're filthy rich, don't hesitate and make sure you match the purchse with a sweet donation somewhere. If you're still a rook but have money to burn and you're buying something no matter what I say, check out the D600-in the end you still may wind up here and I wouldn't blame you. If you shoot on auto, go buy a used DSLR or break out the one you already have-learn to shoot manual before you even think about this thing.Regarding the D800E: I probably should have gone with the D800E based on how and what I shoot combined with my skills in post, but I decided to just go with ol' reliable (anti-aliasing filter over the sensor). Who knows when, where, and for what I will want to use this camera in the future, so why risk subject/process confinement brought on by the D800E's potential for additional moire in certain settings? In the end I find the debate to be a bit mute anyways, as the resolution different being discussed is so fine it really should not have any major impact on your photography. This thing has so much resolution that unless you are working with the world finest glass with ideal depth of field in perfect light, you'll hardly notice the difference at 100% ASIDE from the occasional addition of moire via the D800E.

Hemingway", "ReviewID": "RAGK94KTFW2ZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using my D800 for several months now (landscapes, cityscapes, some events), I have nothing but good things to say about it - the image quality is simply outstanding and it's a dream to use while shooting.AF is fast, quiet, and accurate. All key shooting controls are at your fingertips with dials, buttons, or switches -- there's no need to take your eye from the big, bright viewfinder. If you prefer using live view, the LCD is large, accurate, and highly customizable. In fact, the entire camera is very customizable -- you can tailor it to suit your preferred shooting styles using a combination of memory banks, plus creating a special menu of frequently used commands. Dynamic range, especially at ISO 100 to 800, is outstanding, as much as 11 usable stops. Noise is almost absent between ISO 100 to 800, barely noticeable at 1600, and manageable at 3200.Some things to consider regarding the D800. First, with its high resolution sensor, you need to think very carefully about how you shoot. Diffraction shows up fairly early (Nikon's technical bulletin says at f/11, other folks have said f/8 or even f/5.6), so stopping down for depth of field (DoF) can be a bit more of a trade-off.Second, focus must be very precise because the D800's high resolution can be unforgiving. Where small errors might be covered by DoF with other cameras, they are likely to be revealed by the D800.Third, there's no sense putting anything but excellent lenses on the D800. This sensor is so good that it will show up anything less. It's always been true that you have to think in system terms when considering camera body and lenses -- it's all the more true with the D800.Fourth, when shooting raw and using an 800X cards, I get 15 shot bursts before the buffer fills; it takes a while for it to clear. The D800 generates huge files -- about 73MB uncompressed raw and 43MB lossless compressed raw -- which has implications for continuous shooting and for storage. If you often need to shoot frequent long bursts, the D800 may not be for you. On the other hand, so far I haven't missed a shot because of this -- but I don't shoot sports or fast action.Fifth, the D800 really isn't a beginner's camera. To make best use of its amazing capacities, you need to know something about photography, about how DSLRs function, and have some experience shooting in the field. It's a camera to step up to, not to start with.Bottom line: Wow, what a camera!", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Think Carefully before you buy", "Author": "Stephen Weiss \"Stephen Weiss\"", "ReviewID": "R2RA45S37B6BGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: 2012_06_07  I have been using the camera for a month and I want to echo the advice of others.

I have also found that 400X is the minimum speed I find provides acceptable performance during a photo shoot. Lexar has the 400X 16 and 32 gb cards at a very reasonable price. Don't forget the second slot for the SDHC card. Speed there is an issue particularly if you are using for backup. Personally, I find the added steps with this camera to be useful because it slows me down and I spend more time with composition and lighting. That pays off. The camera renders beautiful color tones, particularly skin tones. So the budget for this camera should have room for new cards and if possible, a solid tripod. Good luck with your purchase.Bottom line, the D800 is a magnificent camera. I would buy it again in a heart beat. I have used Nikon cameras and lenses for 40 years.I shoot a lot of available light portraits in less than ideal situations and I can see that it will not be easy to get the best images with this camera without a lot of work and attention and bumping up the iso more than I would like. I do 24x30 prints or larger for exhibits and I am greedy about keeping the iso as low as I can:) BUT to actually be able to use this camera to its full extent it is important to know that it is really best suited for photographers who work at an advanced amateur or professional level. Even then, there are many professionals who will discover that the camera is not flexible enough to meet their needs.  Be very cautious, do not buy this camera until you have read the entire Nikon Technical Manual available for download. This is separate from the manual.If you are not very experienced, I  recommend that you consider the D 7000 instead. It is far easier to get the best pictures. The D800 is a very complex camera and achieving the kind of images you want requires lots of practice, patience and study. It also requires a tripod in many settings, Nikon says that in multiple places. I agree. I did not at first and my images were not as sharp as I wanted them to be. I work as a professional and I bought the D800 to replace my Mamiya medium format with the 28 mp back. The Mamiya lenses are  excellent lenses. I only shoot RAW. The images so far have better richness, depth, and three dimensionality than the best of my medium format images. The rendering of shadows is wonderful with undetectable noise. Images at an ISO of 400-800 are still superb, unlike my other cameras. But Nikon is very clear that to take advantage of the high resolution you need to use a tripod in most situations. Please review the Nikon Technical Manual. What they say about even minuscule movement is true. They recommend using live view, but I find it very slow because the scene cannot be seen until the camera writes the entire file. BUT it is important to emphasize that this camera indeed replaces the medium format digital cameras and then some. Medium format cameras have trouble with noise in shadows among other problems, the Nikon puts them to shame.  The D800 renders perfect and I mean perfect skin tones and dynamic range. The colors are rich and and have a real depth to them.Obviously the lenses are a big factor but I used the same lenses on my D200. I usually use a hand held meter, but the center weighted metering when I tested it works beautifully. The bokeh with the 16-35, 50, and 70-200 lenses is exceptional and the images have a haunting beauty almost 3-D quality. Again, believe it. It focuses so fast with the G lenses that I often think it has not focused. I have read that some people describe an asymmetric softness in the view finder, I have not seen that. I use a camera without my glasses and I have ordered the 2+ diopter viewfinder lens because the built in dial is about 1-1.5 diopters short of what I need. My glasses have a 2.75 add. I have some exceptional images from a portrait session of a mother and child in my studio. I use the Profoto lighting system, and my main light is usually powered at 1,000 watt seconds with a 300 watt second bounced fill. I used my Nikon 50mm 1.4mm lens, ISO 100, 1/250th, f 7.1. I did not use a tripod or live view or mirror up. I had wonderful detail but even when they were absolutely still there is a slight softness of the whole image. Truthfully, it was a bonus because the image is exactly what you want to deliver to a client. Detailed but not so sharp as to be unflattering. Under the exact same settings with the Mamiya, the detail was so sharp that one could see individual pores on the face and I had to back it off in photoshop. I know that as I get more skilled with the camera imagers will be very detailed and much sharper and I will need to deal with that sharpness. In a natural light portrait session with the same woman, again sharp but not the sharpness that one would expect. I was using a tripod, 1/50th, f 4 and the same lens at iso 100. I did not use live view because I didn't take the technical guide seriously :) I will now!Bottom line: get this camera if you have read the technical manual and feel comfortable with Nikon's recommendations.

However, the D800 is in a class by itself, with its 36 megapixel full frame processor.  This is not the kind of camera you use with cheap glass, so I got a Zeiss ZF2 25mm f/2 wide angle to go with it.  I already had a Zeiss ZF2 35mm f/2, plus the old 80mm Zeiss Planar from my Hasselblad, and those are the lenses I currently use with this camera.I took the camera to the Monterey Peninsula in California to test it out while I was on vacation.  West Coast seascapes can be a real challenge, and it is easy to get blown highlights or blocked shadows because of the wide tonal range of the scenes in direct sunlight.  Not the D800!  That matrix metering handles a wide variety of lighting situations, and as long as you apply the histograms and bracketing capability under tough situations, this camera will deliver the goods.  I shot bright seascapes, low light forestscapes in pine forests, you name it, I shot it.  This camera will do it all.Hook this camera up to good Zeiss glass, for example, and you have a world class camera, essentially a medium format camera in a smaller body.  I won't lie to you, if you put sub-par lenses on this thing, it will unmask them pretty quickly.  So if you buy into this camera, get the good optics to go with it, or you won't realize its full potential.  I put my old Hasselblad 80mm Zeiss Planar on this camera, using a Fotodiox adapter, and the results were absolutely stunning.  The resolution with this sensor hooked up to Zeiss glass is scary!  It's that good!Treat yourself to this camera, but remember that it demands excellent optics --- the lenses you used with your DX sensor are probably not good enough, though you can turn this camera into a DX sensor with the flick of a switch!  And it is not a beginner's camera, you will have to have some photographic maturity to handle this thing.  I used manual cameras for over forty years, so my old skills kicked in when I was using the D800 to do manual overrides of the meter readings.  But aside from that --- if you want world class equipment at a great price, this is the one.  Just buy it.

At last...long last I believe that I have a copy of the D800 that is defect free! I love this camera and did not want to give up on it...it just feels right and takes amazing pictures. I went through 8 copies - starting with my first purchase back in June from BB stores.....it had the left focus point issue. I returned it and purchased from Amazon...proceeding to exchange twice and all three from Amazon had the left focus point issue much to my dismay! I decided to give up on the D800 and ultimately ended up trying the D600 out. Compared to the D800, the D600 felt cheap and not nearly as intuative - I hated the dials and missed the layout of the D800...not to mention the focus area was limited and also mine had the dreaded oil spots on the sensor. It went back and I gave the D800 another try from Amazon....on my 6th exchange from Amazon (which arrived in early February) I finally got a body that rocks! (Serial number is 3056XXX). Admittedly I was a little jaded and after a quick test assumed it had the LF issue. I even went so far as to purchase a refurb from BH (at a $300 savings) assuming that the refurb would have been corrected. Well I did an in depth compare between my 2 Amazon bodies (that were purchased new serial 304 and 305xxxx) and the refurb and I realized a couple of things:The refurbished body had not been refurbished at all...it was the worst performer of the three...and with a shutter count of only 7 when I received it, it was clear not a lot of diagnostics were done by Nikon...if any at all!The 304xxxx that was my original (2nd time) purchased D800 from Amazon did in fact have the left forcus issue.The 305xxxx body from Amazon did not! For sure the left side focused noticeably sharper in live view than in using the left autofocus point, but so did the right side....they were equally better in live view than they were in standard autofocus....AND THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED!! Live view (especially when using the outer focus points) is always more acurate than standard AF! (it is also far slower).Needless to say, I am happy I stuck it out and I truly believe I have a defect free body. I am happy with the results and am really enjoying shooting with this camera. It is an amazing camera with INCREDIBLE dynamic range! I won't give it five stars just due to the extreme hassle I had with so many of these bodies, but I am bumping my review to 4 stars and I absolutely think that if you get one of these cameras today and if it is in the 305xxxx, it would be a five star for you too! Enjoy!This is an amazing AMAZING camera, with (for me) very intuitive controls and a dynamic range beyond belief. Although some from both sides of the AF issue might argue \"why three stars\", I am in the middle of the arguement....my thoughts are even with the AF issue, there are so many other great things about the camera, that it still ranks 3 stars. This is partially why I have not given up on getting a good copy. This was number 5 for me...it was an exchange for defective copy number 4. The fourth one was better than the 5th, so I kept number 4, and am waiting until the end of my return period to hopefully get a 305xxxx camera that is error free.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sure enough, bad AF.", "Author": "Sajid", "ReviewID": "R2YCNLQA19W5Y7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my first full-frame and this is also my first review.

He", "ReviewID": "R3FMTE3LXMHIDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While a lot people are waiting for their perfect D800, I got mine the day before yesterday on Oct. 9th (not from Amazon).First of all, let me talk about the AF issue,I spent two days crunched all kinds of test to find AF issue in my D800.Summary:The D800 I received has very minor/acceptable left AF issue;Serial #: 30494xxTest conditions: paired with 24-70 F2.8, ISO800(cleaner than ISO400 of D7000), bright room light,1/60 sec, with tripodFindings:At 24mm F2.8:Left AF sensor with no AF fine tune just started to show blur, it requires -3 AF fine tune(FT) to be in best focus,and requires -1 AF FT to reduce blur to indiscernible level.Center/right sensors requires no AF FT.At 70mm F2.8:(which most people are less concerned of)Left/center/right all shows optimal focus results without AF FT.Strictly speaking, the D800 I have do have minor left AF issue,In my opinion, it's totally tolerable, if it just require -1 to be sharp.Test approaches:1. Shooting at three Siemens stars on the wall with left center and right AF sensors,  compare with live view focusing for each case.  With this test, it's very hard to find the left AF point has issue.  Yes, at 24mm, the left AF focusing is little more blury than live view focusing,  but not to the extent that I can draw conclusion that my D800 has AF issure.  AF focusing is softer than live view all the time for other DSLRs.  If I just stop here, I would probably end up saying \"I got a perfect D800\",  cos I know the D800 some people got has way off left AF point.2. So I did one more simpler test: shooting at a ruler at an angle (~45 degree), I fine tuned my D7000 this way.  It's better to use a metric ruler, since the numbers are closer.  At 24mm, when I focused at, say, 5cm, with left AF point, the best focus was between 6 and 7cm,(smaller number closer to the camera)  which means my camera has back focus problem. It requires AF FT -3 to move best focus back to 5cm.  Center and left points show perfect focusing results.3. I did another test to confirm. I shoot at Siemens star again with left AF point.  Instead of comparing with live view focusing, I scanned through the AF fine tunes from +3 to -6.  Find my image are clear/acceptable from 0 to -5, best focus is between -2 and -3,  which confirmed with my findings with method 2.  Again find center and left point requires no fine tune.Bottom line:I am pretty happy with the results, given that some people received one that require 20+- AF FT.Imagine -2 and -3 fine tune is totally acceptable, and without fine tune the image quality is acceptable too.Also, this only happens for 24mm F2.8, longer focal length has less to no AF problem.How many times when I shoot at 24mm with F2.8 (F2.8 for landscape?)?How many times when I need to use the leftmost focus point for those circumstances?Close to none! 90% times I use the center AF point.Sadly, the AF results are not consistent across all points.But how many people really test all of the AF points this way for their DSLRs,I bet none of the camera will give perfect focusing for all their sensors.I should test my D7000 too sometime later.Solutions:Keep the camera and do nothing about the left AF point.Initially I set the AF FT to -1,I found it brings my center and right AF points to front focus a little bit,my center AF point has to be perfect,So I move my AF FT back to 0.Other comments:I don't want to repeat the great things other people already said.Great ISO performance, clean at 1600, usable at 3200, sharp at 800.Great and accurate color, even though I prefer the colors my D7000 more,I think I just need more time to get used to it.Great size, weight, and handling, I find my D7000 too small/light for pro lens like, 24-70;now is much balanced. This is also the main reason I refrained from D600,given that it's a little wider D7000 with FX sensor.It's a pity that the battery handle is not magnesium like D4 or Canon pro cameras,and it's not fully enclosed with magnesium, with opening under flash.Mine has no greenish tint !Will forget about the AF problem and go out take some great pictures!Wish you best of luck in getting the D800 that you can love!*Some quick update on my test with D7000 AF using ruler approach, tested with 50mm F1.8 at F1.8.When the center AF point focus perfectly, both left and right AF point show slight back focusing and require -1 ~-2 AF fine tune. Good thing is the problem is symmetric. Imagine if the right point is perfectly aligned, the left point will probably need -2~-3 AF fine tune. Nikon probably adjusts the left first, then adjusts the right which messed up the left a little bit, that's my guess.I think this problem is probably because at wide angle (50mm is not as wide as 24mm when I test D800, I just don't bother to exchange lenses) and aperture wide open, the image is no long perfectly flat. Nikon adjusts the rest focus point so as when they focus the center point is in focus too if shooting a flat surface (it's totally my guess here).I wonder how many people with D3 and D700 test this AF problem, or Canon guys. This problem is probably widespread, and always exist. Though the early D800's problems sound really outrageous, they probably just wanted to maximize their production to meet the demand and didn't spend enough time to align the sensors.

I use 35mm Nikon f4s film cameras, a couple of Hasslelbads and 4\"x5\" cameras. My previous digital camera was a Nikon D70s which served me well. I have been holding off upgrading until a full frame digital camera came out that would allow me to take advantage of my extensive set of Nikon lens...especially the wide angle lens that were limited by the DX format.  But I also wanted to get a camera that offered more than basic functions. I finally found that in the D800 Nikon.First...as a picture taking machine it has impressed me VERY much....more to follow on that. The particular features that have impressed me the most:1. HD video capability2. Handling- while the camera body feels good...the addition of the Meike Vertical battery pack and control really makes it fit my hand well...reminds me of my Nikon F4s cameras.3. Ability to do a lot of image processing right in the camera that I would normally use Photo Shop to do.4. Ability to create custom favorite setups and assign to 4 different master settings.5. 100% viewfinder coverage6. Real time viewing of image on the camera screen in both stills and videos7. Ability to STILL use all my older Nikon AF lens...this was the reason I originally swapped my entire camera system from Canon which obsoleted my older lens with their new cameras.8. Use of two memory cards...Compact Flash and SD...I use CF for high quality RAW images and SD card for video and copy of each RAW image in JPGs.  The backup provides extra insurance and elimates making a coversion to JPGs later.9. Electronic \"level\" in XandY assistance...very handy for architecture.10. Image correction to somewhat simulate a view camera.11. Electronic grid in view finder ...use for same reason as #9.12. HDR capability very useful for strong lighting differences.Things missing that I would like:1. ability to record sound bite with each still picture2. I use AAs in the accessory Mieke grip....would prefer to use AAs in the body also as they are obtainable in an emergency from just about anywhere. I use the included battery in the body but set the camera to always use the AAs first. The included battery is 1900mAhr whereas I can get 2800 mAhr rechargeable batteries which give more exposures although not dramatic.Now about the most important thing in any camera....image quality.I am noted for my larger print sizes...generally 16\"x20\" up to 17\"x25\" printed on my Epson 3800 Pro printer or even larger printed commercially at a lab. As a medium format and 4\"x5\" user I often print large sizes and at very high quality levels that have been magazine covers,shown in galleries, etc.  I decided to try some tests for sharpness, color fidelity, image smoothness and noise (grain to film users). I shot at ISO 100 a few flower images under controlled lighting conditions to maximize range. On one I noted a couple of ants walking on the flower so decided to see what it would look like blown up to huge dimensions. I enlarged the full frame image so that it was 10' wide. I than cropped a 8\"x10\" piece of that print including the ant. I was amazed to see that the ant was still extremely sharp and detailed and the noise/grain was still not evident. This all was not modified from the raw image using my normal \"trick\" of using a fractal program...just used PS to enlarge the image. In truth this image quality was as good as my best Hasselblad images (but no my Hasslelbad is NOT for sale).I think this is probably the camera to get if you want the best image quality in the Nikon Line. The top of the line Nikon camera (at double the price) are probably better for sports photography but that is not my interest. The 36MP FX chip does indeed do its magic if your subjects are portraits, product, architectural, scenic. As a side note...you can shoot at very high ISOs and the noise is very acceptable. The abiliity to automatically use noise reduction for very high ISOs and long duration exposures if very handy too.Overall...this is a superlative camera but it has an incredible amount of features so don't expect to just pick it up and start shooting....if you do you will miss all of its \"good\" stuff.

Ford \"Ed Ford\"", "ReviewID": "ROC7ACL279W29", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First please allow me to introduce myself. I am an avid amateur. I am a member of the Delaware Photographic Society of which I am the Equipment Chair, and the Photographic Society of America.I have been shooting my D800 for over 6 weeks. I have about 1500 shutter actuations. My previous (and still owned) DSLR IS a Nikon D300 (22,000+ shutter actuations). I use a number of lenses, including a very excellent Nikkor AF 80-200mm f/2.8 (circa 1995) lens, and also the outstanding AF Nikkor 35-70mm f/2.8. I also have 4 AF-S lenses including the 105 f/2.8, the 28-300 and the 10-24 DX, and the 50mm f/1.4..I have gone into detail on my lenses so you will know what I have been using on the camera. Please note, before continuing this review - it is the photographer that produces the images, the camera only records what the photographer sees, and the camera body is less important to the quality of the photo than is the glass on the front of the camera. Poor lenses will produce poor photos on any camera made.I have read reviews complaining about focus issues. I have had no trouble with focus or sharpness of my photographs with this camera. I must respectfully disagree with the other reviews which complain about focus on the D800. I seldom use a tripod and have not felt compelled to do. I recently shot two events with both of my cameras - the professional bicycle race in Philadelphia (June 3) and the more recent MS Society MuckRuckus in Newtown Square, PA. Both events were action events and I found no difference between the two cameeras on the quality of the images concerning focus. The Camera behaved flawlessly. My biggest issue with sharpness of my photos is when I am too quick on the trigger, not the camera's fault.This camera has 1 drawback to my shooting - the slow frame rate on continuous high speed shooting. I suspect that is due to the large file size with respect to the size of the buffer memory in the camera. Having said that I can still get 6 frames a second with a battery pack (and essential item of my inventory - never have to worry about missing a moment due to battery change) and shooting in DX Mode. That gives me 19MP images which is more than large enough if I frame the photo anywhere near correctly. That is my one big Con on the list.Pros:1. High ISO performance: I have no fear kicking the ISO up to as much as 4000 (or more) thousand for regular shooting. In my own limited experiments I have found miniscule noise difference between ISO 400 and ISO 4000. That enables me to use very high shutter speeds with my fast glass. That in turn has essentially removed all real concerns about sharpness.2. AF Performance: On my D300 I have had some issues with older non-AF-S lenses due to relatively slow focus rate by the mechanical drive. however, with AF-S lenses it was wonderful. On my D800 those concerns have evaporated. The mechanical drive focus lenses (read AF Nikkor) focus so fast, the focus rate is almost indistinguishable from the AF-S lenses. I use both freely, without concern on the camera, and have had great success with both.3. Lens compatibility: I can use almost any lens made by Nikon since 1959. Older lenses do need to have be converted to AI (Aperture Index) configuration unless they are fixed aperture (Cat lens - f/8 only). That is also true for my D300 so that is not a change. But that fact is one of the major contributing factors in my choosing Nikon over other brands. In addition, though the D800 is a full frame sensor camera it will use my APS-C lenses as well - it simply switches to DX (Nikon's term for APS-C) mode and includes a black frame in the view finder to show the coverage of the lens. Some of my best lenses are used lenses I bought for a song compared with newer lenses and have given me truly wonderful results. I can use every lens I have with either camera D300 (DX or APS-C) and D800 (FX or full frame).4. Build quality: True the camera is not quite built like the D4, but then it costs half as much. Over all I have found it to be a very solid, well built, well balanced camera. I have already been caught in soft  rain and drizzle with the camera and have had no problems with it weather sealing. I have had no software issues with the camera either - no freezing or other glitches in its operation.5. Update: Since I submitted the review I remembered something else that is a definite Pro. Raw File size: The D800 will take pictures in 12 or 14 bit color depth. When shooting uncompressed Raw files in 14 bit color depth the file size is about 75MB per photo. However Nikon has included 2 versions of Raw recording which create smaller files. There is a mode called \"Lossless compressed Raw\". Lossless compressed mode compresses the files with a reversible compression algorithm. If you choose\"Lossless compressed Raw\" and use 12 instead 14 bit color depth the file size per photo is reduced to about 32.4MB, less than half of the largest file size. There is also a \"Compressed Raw\" mode, which using 12 bit color depth reduces the file size further to 29MB. Compressed Raw is not reversible, but the image quality difference is really minuscule (if any) compared to uncompressed or Lossless compressed.Cons:1. Low frame rate for continuous high speed shooting including bracketing.2. Cost - but that is niggling considering the abilities the camera brings to the table.I could go on longer, but this is enough for the moment. I highly recommend the camera but only for very avid amateurs, semi-professional or professional photographers. It is a complex tool capable of doing a great deal. But it takes time to learn to use properly - it can not be done in one day, or even a month. It will take time and use to master this camera. I have not met a casual amateur photographer willing to put that effort into learning a camera, hence my caveat above. Finally, In my humble estimation DxO Labs was right on the money with their evaluation of the sensor - hightest rating ever for a camera, including Medium format cameras. It is a marvelous tool.Ed Ford", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this camera... but", "Author": "C", "ReviewID": "R1M44CV0RK4JUC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it attracts way too much dust on the sensor.

Sometimes you might miss a shot if the card is too slow.  Also, using the live-view can be a problem when shooting in the highest FPS setting. I've had the camera lock-up on me multiple times.

Very very good camera. Very happy with the resolution. You can virtually crop to the smallest detail ( in RAW format ) without fear of losing detail. Beware of two major points: 1)Get a large memory card when shooting in RAW. Some images for me have exceeded 50MB plus. I have carried at least three cards of 64GB when travelling. On a recent two week trip overseas I shot through three cards without so much as blinking. Came within 20 images of running out of memory at the end of the trip. That was over 1200 plus images for me at the time.Also beware of something more troublesome, however from a maintenance standpoint. You may see this in other reviews as well. Don't know if this is unique to Nikon or not. There appears to be an \"over-lubrication\" of the shutter mechanism on this camera, maybe other Nikons as well, though my D7000 does not exhibit this issue. You will see the results in your images with small annoying dark grey specks or dots on your images. This is not dirt but oil droplets. The \"splatter\" of the excess oil shows up due to lodging onto the sensor. These will NOT \"blow\" off or clean off with the camera self-cleaning feature. They have to be removed with sensor cleaning. Will get worse as time goes on to a certain point of around 10,000 images shot as I read on other websites. I have already cleaned my sensor twice in just 5000 images. They are gone after cleaning but then re-appear again with additional shooting. Frustrating if you are picky about your photography, and who wouldn't be with a camera of this price-point. The cleaning of the sensor can be a daunting task if not approached carefully and with confidence. Many experts say not to do this yourself but really it is not a big deal if done properly with the correct cleaning tools. I will leave that for the experts to delve into on other websites. Anyway, just beware of this is an issue with the Nikon D800 so you will not be surprised when it happens. Really annoying to deal with, but the image specks are removable in Photoshop (clone tool) or in other software applications. Just shouldn't have to deal with this issue and Nikon should address it seriously. If under warranty, you can send back in to Nikon to clean the sensor of the oil specks but you will do this more than once if you don't learn to clean it yourself.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Um, Yeah.

I have been using the d800 for several months now with a variety of lenses in a range of shooting situations. I use the camera for a mix of professional work which includes portraits and product stills, and for fun.Controls:I upgraded from my d300 because I dropped it and the flash was no longer working. The transition has been relatively smooth although I do find that I have had to relearn and remap a few of the controls. The switching of the + and - zoom controls still gets me, and I do miss the old auto focus mode selector that used to be on the back of my d300. I like having the bracketing button in easy access have it set to easily shoot in camera HDRs. Overall I find the control layout an improvement from the d300 especially the one touch live view button, and simple toggle between AF and MF.Using DX lenses:I still use my 17-55 DX lens with the d800 and right now am very happy with the results. I have my custom button set to switch between FX, 1.2x, and DX crop modes which is a lifesaver when using my old 17-55. Past its widest settings I like to use this lens in the 1.2x crop mode to get nice detailed 25mp images without too much vignetting. I have a 27\" imac an on this size screen I cannot tell the difference between a 15mp dx cropped image and a 36mp full frame image but for large prints it may make a difference. One thing I do love about shooting the full 36mp resolution however is penalty free cropping. I had to be careful on my 12mp d300 about not cropping to much and loosing image quality but now I will crop out half of a 36mp file still be floored by the amout of detail. Overall I see no problem with using my DX lenses with the new camera and actually enjoy the added flexibility and creative potential they provide. I sometimes enjoy the circular image the 17-55 creates at its widest setting at the FX crop.ISO:Based solely on my observations I would say the d800 gains about 2 2/3 stops in ISO quality. Before, I would shoot my d300 up to ISO 400 and be completely satisfied with noise, dynamic range, and color quality. With the d800 I can now bump up to ISO 2500 and be completely satisfied with image quality. In low light situations I find bumping the d800 to ISO 5000 is about as high as I am willing to go before the image quality starts to degrade significantly. Auto ISO works much better and is easier to setup.RAW vs JPEG:I like to shoot RAW + JPEG and find that most of the time I am happy with the JPEG. Reading reviews I thought that RAW would provide a HUGE headroom in the shadows and while I find there is a good amount of data in the shadows I would say no more than a stop. Files are very detail but you can definitely see the effects of the anti aliasing filter and sometimes I wish I had sprung for the d800E. By default RAW images are not especially sharp and I almost always need to bump up the sharpness in software. On a positive note in the thousands of pictures I have shot I have yet to see moire.Metering:I find that the metering is much better on the d800 than d300. I rarely switch away from multizone metering as it is just very good at figuring out the scene and I dont have to use a lot of exposure compensation either.Live view:Live view is a VAST improvement from the d300 which was almost unusable. Having a button to quickly pull up live veiw is great! Although live view focusing still leaves quite a bit to be desired it will eventually find focus in most lighting situations.Auto focus:About the same as the d300. Fast and dependable as long as you can find a point with good contrast to lock onto.Overall:I am very happy with my d800 purchase. I recently purchased the 50mm 1.8 and have been using this for shallow depth of field and low light shots and think the color quality and sharpness of this combination is just outstanding. If I could think of a complaint I would say the Live View focusing could be better, and the battery life is not quite as good as my old d300 which was just insane. The build quality is also just a tiny notch below the d300 but overall feels very professional. The rear screen on the d800 is great and I have not had any color tint problems. The left focus problems that have plagued so many other users has not been an issue for me. I would say everything about the d800s image quality is a step better than the d300 and the main thing it has been doing for me is allowing me to shoot more freely. I shoot looser crops because I know I can always crop in without losing quality, and I rarely worry about how high I have take my ISO which used to be a constant worry with the d300. I debated for a long time which camera would suit be best as an upgrade for my d300. I went between waiting for a d300 successor, getting a used d700, slimming down with an OMD-E5, buying a d600 or going for the d800. A direct d300 successor would have been nice but the added depth of field with full frame was a big decider for me as I shoot a lot of portraits. The OMD would be great but I am already pretty heavily invested in Nikon glass and was not ready to compromise on low light image quality. For me the d600 was just to plasticy and I was not happy with the control setup.In the end I am very happy with my decision although every once and a while when I am shooting landscapes I wish I had gone for the d800e.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "A copy from recent batch still has left AF and green WB issues", "Author": "D.

Yes you will need decent shot discipline but this camera has so much in reserve to help you out, it is one of the finest image capture devices out there.A word on weather sealing.  The gaskets are supposed to be below the quality of the D4 but having dropped this in fine sand, in very shallow salt water as well as used it in the desert at near 50c in a sandstorm I never had a problem.  If you're going to abuse your gear more than me (!) get a D4, it's built like a tank.As I said above it can really help you out in a fix.  If you do screw up a shot you can sometimes save it.

This time, I found the typical round spots as well as a newly identified faint blob on images.  These artifacts were best reproduced against a sky blue background.  I do like the image quality, but I am absolutely livid about the continuing spot issue.  Also on the last occasion, the fine tune settings shifted requiring optimization recalibration of all my lenses.UPDATEMy original review was conferred with 5 stars.  I dropped the score to 4 stars after 2x service stops for oil spots.  Today, I dropped the score another point for a general system AF shift post service.  In short, I am having to apply extreme AF settings to get sharp focus results with my lenses.  For example, my 17-35mm worked perfectly with zero adjustment before the second servicing for oil spot removal, and my camera now requires a full 17+ post service.  I have to wonder if Nikon has lost its commitment to quality control; the chairman's message is about transparency, but I suppose the consumer doesn't count.ORIGINALI had been looking forward to the day when I'd be able to step up from DX to FX, and be able to capture images approaching film quality. The D800 is that camera for color image capture.I have had over 2500 actuations since my purchase in early December. There have been no issues noted with left side AF when tested at 17 and 35mm at f/2.8 (camera serial 301xxxx).  I did note a penchant for green hues, but that was easily remedied via color balance (setting M1).  As for performance against the D300 ... well, I hope my daughter enjoys it as much as I did.The colors are really magnificent with a depth approaching Ektachrome, Image details are razor sharp even when blown up; it is amazing to see the facial details, the individual hairs, on a big cat taken 25 yards distant with the D800 and a 70-200mm lens.  Being able to duplex captured images has been very handy ... I've already had one instance where an image was deleted on one card, but still available from the second card (I'll admit wishing there were 2 CF slots vs. one SD and one CF).Alas, Nikon hasn't quite achieved perfection.- A sensor oil droplet.  Drat that it should have happened, and for the extra work to remove them from my photos.  While traveling through LA, I deposited the camera at Nikon's west coast service center in the morning, and retrieved the camera the afternoon of the same day [I have to wonder what else Nikon fixed under the radar, so to speak].- Some controls have changed relative to the D300 which makes for a bit of re-education.- And as noted earlier, there was the green hue.  I compensated for it using Rockwell's published hint of adjusting the color balance.- There is an annoying rattle when the flash is closed, which is most of the time, and which stops when the flash is deployed.  I guess that's normal, when the locking springs are not engaged.Overall, I'm very impressed.  But, I add the final note that the new camera has also been a bit of a home wrecker.  My D300 was, as noted, relegated to a new home, my F100 has been demoted to B&W;, and the venerable FE is to be retired to eBay.ADDENDUM - Two sensor spots in exactly the same coordinate as previously reported.

Both cameras are exceptional.Both are used primarily for wildlife, hand-held, in a kayak. For this, the D7100 is usually the better choice because it shoots a little faster and has a 1.5x crop factor.  It costs less, so you'll probably worry about it less and use it more.There is no need for me to go into the science of why the D800 is so good. You can find a dozen articles online that discuss the camera's resolving powers.  What matters is that when you get it right with the D800, you will know it.  And your friends and family will inevitably mention National Geographic, photo contests or selling your work.The D800 is like a musical instrument. The more you practice, the better it gets. Don't expect to pick it up and crank out a masterpiece. In 2013, the D800 is the \"Stradivarius\" of cameras.  If your lens collection is primarily consumer and pro-sumer grade, buy the D7100.  If you have some high-end glass and you are committed to sharpening your skills, consider the D800.At f22 against a bright white sky, I had no issues with dust or oil spots on the sensor. Can't say the same for my D7100. But Nikon has probably corrected this issue by now.While the camera is expensive and better than I am at taking pictures, buying it was a fairly easy decision. If you are really into photography, you know how it goes...You have two choices:1. You could not buy it.2.

Collins", "ReviewID": "R3LXAIWDAD42Q6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a background, I've been shooting SLRs for nearly 35 years.  I've owned and loved my Nikon D300, battery grip, and Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 and 14-24mm f/2.8 lenses for nearly 5 years.  I was ready to upgrade to a \"hybrid\" stills and video camera, but my primary passion is stills photography.Like most folks, I was extremely excited about the D800 when it was announced, but paused as it became clear that there were some manufacturing problems that were being sorted out.  I waited a year and recently purchased a D800 body with serial 305xxx from Amazon, thinking that surely the left-focus issue was behind us.  I was incorrect.I received the camera, charged the battery, put it on a tripod, and tested the left focus sensors.  The problem was glaringly present, obvious without a fancy test.  My camera body appears to be manufactured in June of 2012 based on the factory date setting and the firmware update.  I put it through a few tests to see how bad the problem really was then decided that the camera body was going back.  Discounting the left-focus problem, here are my observations from my brief tests:Image quality: Simply, utterly amazing (when you use the center focus point).  Dynamic range is remarkable.  For pros and serious amateurs it would seem the image quality is the best you can purchase in this form factor today.  The high ISO noise performance is every bit as good as the 5D Mark III per sensor area (not to be confused with per pixel noise performance, which is not a useful metric these days).  At the end of the day, some might argue that stills image quality is all that matters, and the D800 has this nailed.Autofocus:  Seems only slightly different than the D300, with one exception.  Face detection through the viewfinder actually works and seems to aid not only candid photography, but also sports/action where faces can be detected.  This feature does not require Live View.  I didn't upgrade the camera to the new firmware release, but I understand this improves AF even more.  Good-to-great AF over all.Ergonomics:  The camera is BEEFY but the grip is remarkably small.  The grip finger grooves on this full-frame camera can fit only 2.5 out of 3 not-overly-large fingers.  Also the little thumb groove on the back is barely present, so it feels a bit like holding a 2x4--not terribly confidence inspiring without a neck strap.  The exposure mode dial is far too tight, not readily adjustable with my thumb like my D300.  I do like the new AF-S/AF-C control button and dials, which seems like a nice improvement over my D300.  The mode button has been moved to make room for an unnecessary video record button.  Why the extra video button when you already have a video mode?Video quality: Moire/aliasing was present when I took my first video of some yellow-pad notebook paper that I taped upon on the wall to test for possible focus problems.  Not sure why this wasn't fixed in the latest firmware release.  The necessary low-pass filter (anti-aliasing) algorithms are well established in the embedded DSP industry and should be possible to employ in-camera with no great difficulty, as evidenced by the D5200 and D7100.  The only real obstacle to solving this otherwise easily avoidable problem (in any camera) is inadequate processor performance.Overall: I'm not sure why Nikon hasn't taken the high road with their customers regarding their recent manufacturing problems.  It would seem their lack of transparency (more than anything else) has created a real customer flight risk and business problem for the company.  Prior to Nikon's handling of the D800 and the D600 manufacturing problems, switching to Canon had never crossed my mind.  Today as I try to upgrade my Nikon body, it has become a real possibility for me.  I really hope the next D800 body is a good one.  I will know tomorrow.======================================UPDATE: Second D800 body serial number 305xxx has the same left focus defect and cannot focus correctly using the left focus sensors.

The step up in build quality, ease-of-access to critical controls and functionality, and balanced handling alone set the D800 apart from most offerings.  Add in latest-gen processing power to handle a 35mm FX sensor rated at 36 MP with an autofocus system not dissimilar from that on the D4 and the D800 pulls an astonishing amount of detail out of the whole frame across a huge range of exposure.While I initially was a little surprised to see the large file sizes, I realized they were hugely beneficial after educating myself on image down-sampling.  While the D800's higher ISOs are very clean and even with no hot spots, diligently down-sampling even very high ISO images cleans up shots to where their quality is on-par with those coming from a D4 or competitor.The question on many peoples' minds seems to be whether the D800 is fast enough - in all honesty, most people considering this back are amateurs for whom 5 FPS continuous shooting is more than adequate - I know it is for me; the AF tracking and superb resolution and rendering are more than up to the task of handling most scenarios.

McCasland", "ReviewID": "R3P2YVOOZYIZQD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera pushed me, a long-time Nikon user, to Canon.This camera would probably be wonderful in a studio environment on a tripod or doing landscapes.  Also, I thought the video quality was very good, arguably better than the Canons' straight-out of the camera even considering some of the limitations pointed out in reviews aimed to more professional videographers.  (See Phillip Bloom's excellent review of the MkIII and D800 video comparision.)  However, for everything else, I didn't see the point in using the D800.  It is much more of a speciality camera in my book than an all-around tool.  For the speciality tasks it undertakes (on a tripod), the results are wonderful.  Yet its performance the rest of the time, I believe, will be eye-opening to the average buyer expecting to use it as an all-around camera like the D700.More details:With the D800, I couldn't get anything usable handheld without crazy-high shutter speeds.  Unfortunately, high shutter speeds routinely caused the ISO to be bumped.  Then, I noticed noise before zooming in at all, much less pixel-peeping.  Having owned a D700 for years, I found myself reverting back to the D700 as an all-around camera and only shooting the D800 when a tripod was possible.  However when a tripod was used, the image quality improvement over the D700 was apparent to virtually any non-technical user (read: clients, family) -- and isn't that ultimately all that matters?  That clearly better image quality over the D700 when a tripod was possible got me lusting for something more all-around that had higher IQ than the D700.Curiosity got the best of me and I bought a Canon MkIII and a few assorted lenses, fully expecting to return or resell the camera unless the quality was immediately apparent.  I found myself shooting the MkIII alongside the D700 and D800.  In many situations where a tripod wasn't possible or practical, most of the D800 images simply got deleted upon review in Lightroom due to blurring.  In the situations where the D800 and MkIII were both used on a tripod, the D800 images were better than the D700, but simply on par with the MkIII unless one really started pixel-peeping (then the D800 looked far cleaner), but again I could care less about pixel peeping since clients too could care less.That left me primarily going-to and comparing the D700 and MkIII for nearly all non-tripod shooting I do.  (After collecting dust for a while, I sold the D800, at a profit.)  While I could take a Nikon image and run it through Lightroom and Photoshop to get the looks I wanted, I was pleased/surprised to find the Canon starting points on images to be closer to the final look I was after. (Note: I am not saying Canon images are better or more right, I am just saying the basic imported Canon files take *me* much less work than the Nikon files to achieve *my own personal look*.)  After doing a few shoots and realizing how much less Lightroom and Photoshop work I had to do with the Canon images, I slowly got to using the MkIII nearly exclusively and just carried the 2 D700s and lenses with me as backups.It's now been about a month using nothing but Canon and I am seriously thinking of just selling my Nikon gear altogether.  For *my personal style*, I find that I get many more \"keeper\" images with the MkIII than I ever did with my Nikons (D40s, D300s, D700s, D7000s, D800s) -- i.e. I am routinely amazed by getting very sharp images at 1/50th of a second handheld -- something I couldn't do with any of my $2000+ Nikon VR lenses.  Then, the time savings in post for my style really pushed me more and more to Canon.  Others' goals may be much different and the looks they are after are better suited for Nikon.  For example, I could see journalistic or sports photographers preferring a Nikon  over Canon.  I would too in their shoes.  However, *for me* the Canon very surprisingly fit me much better.  (After investing so much in Nikon, eagerly awaiting the D800 for months, and spending so much in Nikon lenses, I never thought I would *ever* make that statement.)In the end, my advice is to simply rent or borrow the different cameras and try them, ignoring online reviews such as this one.  You can go blind reading review after review, get  caught up in gear-head stats on the different cameras that have virtually nothing to do with making good pictures, and still make the wrong decision.  There is absolutely no substitute for holding the camera and lenses,  looking at the output first-hand, and only then making your own *personal* decision.", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "This One's for the Fine Art and Portrait Photographer", "Author": "kenn", "ReviewID": "R2RI340WYUJ6EW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was it worth the nearly 4 year wait: YOU BET IT WAS!  Nikon now owns the digital field.

The $3,000 price tag is low considering the tremendous leap in quality.  However, don't expect a complete body overhaul from the D700, Nikon has made many improvements, but kept the 'feel' that so many liked in the D700. The settings are easy to adjust, with many added finger-tip adjustments that will keep you from constantly having to open the camera's menu. The larger 3.2' bright screen gives you 100% coverage, bettering the 700's 95% - not a lot more, but could keep you from later having to crop out Aunt Belle's foot, ear, or nose - or worse - larger portions of her anatomy.

I see the D800 utilized by the protrait, still, and landscape photographer who desires high quality results never before seen in 35mm or FX formats until the introduction of the D800.  I'm not going to touch upon the great vidio quality.  It's there, but I will probably never use it. If you need a camera for hi-speed, low lighting photography then I would stick with the D4, D3S, or the D3X which best handle the 6400+ISO.

The 36 megapixel resolution is helpful because my moving subjects are difficult to frame while I am photographing at 1:1 magnification. The high resolution enables me to use severe cropping later to correct awkwardly composed pictures. I use flash so that I can eliminate artifact due to subject motion and camera shake, and to maximize light for achieving high depth of field with low apertures and low ISO's.  I set the D 800 mode to manual or aperture-priority and the focus to manual. I set the 105 mm macro lens magnification to 1:1 and position the camera to achieve focus.  My photos are often out of focus because of the tough conditions in which I work, so I compensate by taking time to position the camera properly and by taking enough duplicates to get some shots in focus. The D 800 has enabled me to obtain images of much higher quality that I could with my D 200.The D 800 has two serious flaws for my kind of photography. First, its Live View blacks out when I am shooting at low apertures. This is because Live View shows the image with the aperture stopped down to demonstrate depth of field. In Live View, I want the image displayed with the aperture wide open, so that Live View has maximum light and minimum depth of field, enabling me to discern the focal plane. I need to see the focal plane in order to focus manually, positioning the camera. Live View in point-and-shoot cameras works the way I like, so it appears that Nikon over-engineered the D 800's Live View, now ruined for my kind of work. Implemented correctly, Live View could have helped me photograph insects at 1:1 magnification in the field, but I now use strictly the optical viewfinder.Second, the D 800's flash intermittently fails in Commander mode to trigger my wireless flash, a Metz Mecablitz ring flash screwed on to the end of the macro lens. This failure occurs when I set the D 800's flash to trigger my ring flash rather than to provide image illumination. (Others have reported failure of the D 800 flash in Commander mode to trigger Nikon-manufactured SB speedlights.) To avoid failure when I use the D 800 flash in Commander mode, I set the D800's flash to \"TTL\" and cover it with an infrared filter that blocks visible light but allows passage of infrared light, which works as the wireless trigger.

After reading some reviews from Amazon, I wanted to contribute mine.It's pretty simple and easy to test this defect of the left focus point of Nikon D800. Within 2 minutes, you should be able to identify the problem. My setting is as follow:-Use FX wide angle lens (mine is 35-70mm F/2.8). Use focal 35mm or wider only.-Select Aperture 2.8 (Aperture priority)-Set speed minimum 100-Set ISO below 3200.-IMPORTANT: select the SPOT light meter mode (first option on the switch next to viewfinder)-IMPORTANT: select the left most focus point in the middle of row of the frame-Chose any paper with small text that you can read or camera can focus.-Use viewfinder (phase defect is more prone to this focus problem)-Set camera 3 ft away and shoot, handheld is fine.- You can see the blurry pictures on the screen camera where you chose to focus.Take more pictures with other focus points, center and right, on the same topic . Then compare and make your own judgement. That's it.I brought my wide angle FX lens and an SD card to the largest electronic store in town ( you know what it is) to try out the D800 bodies, hopefully to get a good one that does not show the left focus issue like many have reviewed on the internet. Unfortunately, after testing FIVE different D800 bodies at two different stores, ALL showed the same problem: left most focus point in SPOT focus mode produces blurry pictures. I do not see problem if I don't use SPOT focus mode.You can easily reproduce this problem when trying out the D800. You can select the topic around any store like the price tag, bar code, etc, (I prefer small text on white paper) using the left most focus point in the SPOT focus mode. Like day and night, you can clearly and easily see the issue on the camera's screen. The focused topic on the picture gets pretty blurry.The ability to focus on a topic accurately of the camera to produce the non-blurry picture is critical in photography. This important feature must be tested and passed before going to mass production or sale services. Nikon and distributor have failed to do that. I don't expect a perfect product, but a fully functional of a determinative feature like the focusing accuracy of an high end camera. I rate this product Nikon D800 as two stars. The first star is for the Nikon employees who put effort to produce this nice camera, but had no authority to fix the left focus point problem. The second star is for the servicing people at the retailer who nicely helped me to experience this camera, but did not know or not aware of this defect.I take three stars off because of those at Nikon manufactures and distributors who know the issue, defect of the product but still want to sale it to customer. Is this an act of cheating?I hope that Nikon will soon admit and fix the left focus of D800, and hope that distributors will not sale any D800 that has this focus problem any more. If this selling continues, I guess distributor and Nikon will get a massive return of this product. That is because most (if not all) users of D800 know how to use the SPOT focus mode and know how to expect a \"quality\" of an high end camera like the Nikon D800. I am not the only one who addressed this problem, but many others.  Is problem real?I also think that the distributor has a power and can force Nikon to admit and fix the \"known\" problem of the left focus of such a nice camera. Nikon, distributor, please proceed to resolve this problem so that other customers like us still have faith in purchasing the good products from your stores.Thanks for reading my review!Update:Please read comment where you can find the link to pictures I took, that shows blurry pictures using left focus point.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Get the Hell Out of Here!", "Author": "Chef de Cuisine \"Chef\"", "ReviewID": "R2TAAB9DR3KW1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have really liked my D7000 for a year and a half.

Bye-Bye D7000!The pics from the D800 are so much crisper and clearer and they just look crystal clear.  I've taken several hundred sample pics in all kinds of light, dim light, no light, regular light, sun light, flash light, and I can honestly say I'm totally blown away at how clear and sharp they are.  Noise?  What noise???  And I'm saying this after taking the same types of pics with the same pro-quality Nikkor lenses that I have been using on my D7000 so the difference isn't in the lenses, and my D7000 was no slouch, so I guess I have to blame these wonderful pics on the camera. The difference in clarity and resolution are without a doubt blazingly obvious and noticeable.  These pics make me look like I'm a better photographer than I thought I was.

Land", "ReviewID": "R2J9UT0VLSV5FU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, let me start by saying: if you are buying this camera solely because you \"want to take better photos\" turn away NOW.  If you are just starting in photography, and want to take awesome photos; never underestimate the awesome power of the D7100, D3100 or D610 (if you want full frame).  However, if you are an advancing amateur, and you feel that you have outgrown your current camera (and have the cash), by all means purchase this camera.Be warned though, this camera DEMANDS respect and perfection in your technique.  36mp is absolute OVERKILL for simple vacation shots, family shots, ect. However, if you are  serious about your photography (or can see yourself becoming serious in the future) 36mp may be extremely helpful in pulling out all the potential your photos have hidden in their RAW state.DO NOT expect to take good pictures simply by purchasing this camera.  You must still have a masterful knowledge of using light, proper technique (using a steady tripod, mirror up mode, exposure delay, proper fStop for a full frame) and handling. With over 36 MILLION megapixels crammed on one sensor, the slightest error, the slightest shake of the camera - where on a 16 or 24mp camera may not have caused an issue - will be GLARINGLY obvious.I have only used this camera for a couple days, and it has really put me in my place as a photographer. I feel my photos are a little worse now because I still have not caught up to the demands of this camera.I took it out today and, honestly, got nothing but crap shots. However, I was absolutely stunned when I took these poor RAW files into Lightroom and turned them into pretty beautiful photos anyways (I still trashed them anyways).  I am excited to see where I can take the photos that I have actually NAILED in the camera.So that was very reassuring.A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO COMMENT ON:1. If you are stepping up from a lesser camera; be sure to read Nikons Technical Guide; Just google Nikon D800 and visit Nikons official webpage. It lays out how to get the optimal sharpness with this camera.2. IF YOU SHOOT BRACKETING/HDR: be forewarned that this camera ABSURDLY will not automatically shoot all bracketed images at once, in timer mode, as it does on the less pro models.  TO CORRECT THIS: - Go into the custom menu and set your number of your timer exposures to 9 so it will take all the bracketed images together.  Also, this camera only allows stops of 1, which seems ridiculous (can anyone explain this?)Honestly though, think before you buy this camera.  Are you ready for such a demanding instrument?  Do you already have some quality, full frame glass you can slap on it?  Again, DO NOT underestimate the ability to pull stellar images out of almost any Nikon DSLR.  You do not need this camera to make great images.The only reason I upgraded was because I used a D7100 and my Tokina 11-16 broke: I was then decided to sell my camera and return the lens, using the cash to get a D610 (since my Nikkor 16-35 is is the same equivalent wide angle focal length). Amazingly, I found an official Nikon refurbed D800 on Ebay for only 500$ more than what I would have spent on the 610, So it seemed like a no brainer.P.S. Once I begin to see the full function of the D800, I am sure my rating will go up to 5 stars.  For now, I knocked a star off for reduced functionality compared to less quality models.UPDATE: 3/16/14Okay, I had to add another star due to the phenomenal image quality produced from this camera. The dynamic range on this camera is nothing short of ASTOUNDING. I shoot a lot of landscapes, and I find myself bracketing a lot to create realistic looking HDR's and blended exposures.  I am stunned to find, that as long as there isn't a radically high margin in stops of light, I can capture just a single image and bring back all the dynamic range. In fact, I am finding that I am getting much better photos doing that, rather than simply creating an HDR, or possibly taking two exposures and do some light blending.Ya know, I take back what I said earlier.  With proper technique and dedication, I feel this camera CAN make you a better photographer.  When you feel that you have, in your hands, absolute control over your vision of what you want your image to be, it really helps to maintain interest in photography and spark more creativity!The only thing that sucks about this camera is the thought of using anything lesser!", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Your best friend... only if you get to know it!", "Author": "Hammad Iqbal", "ReviewID": "R2BCHIQ6AMQQO0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is unlike anything out there in the DSLR universe. I recently moved from a Canon 5D Mark II to a D800. Totally stunned by the images it produces (provided that you have great glass to compliment the sensor). The RAW captures are amazing and processing those files is such a pleasure. The biggest advantage of this camera is of course its super resolution of 36.3MP which can become its extreme disadvantage if you don't have the steadiest of platforms to rest this camera on. Even the micro vibrations can be noticed in the images when viewed at 100%. At 33% you wont notice those. I had my first take with a D800 recently while I was on a rooftop of a building to take a panorama of the city skyline. It was frustrating to see vibrations introduced in the images when viewed at 100%. So I had to take so many shots to get the sharpest, vibration free image. Even then I did not achieve 100% steady images. It's not the camera's fault. It was more likely my tripod head (pistol grip) which was good enough for a 21MP sensor (5D Mark II) but just didnt cut it for 36.3MP. If you want the best resolution, the most detailed images, the best dynamic range, get the D800 without thinking twice. But make no mistake, this camera will test your lenses, tripod and your technique and will bring out the best and the worst. The good thing is that you can quickly learn to adapt and get the most out of this beast. I'm so happy to get a D800.

I like film and will continue using it when I want the look that film gives.  I love that my manual focus 28mm f2.8 I bought 30 years ago works perfectly on the D800 and gives incredible results.  The D800 is an outstanding tool for creating beautiful large prints up to 32\"X40\" (with careful exposure and skillful post processing).

And since refurb unit came with 3 months US Nikon warranty, worst case would be sending my unit to service.After I received the camera, I did extensive test to the camera.  My unit definitely do not have problem 4) and 5) I mentioned above.  Honestly, I am pretty sure problem 4) is just rare outlier problem since I have only seen on complain online; also, 5) is probably a virtually non-exist problem or it's fixed by firmware update already.Nikon expert Thom Hogan said the left autofocus point problem \"appears to have stopped in the US with serial numbers higher than about 3055000\".  Since my unit is below that number, I performed extensive autofocus test.  My test included shooting test target such as Siemens, strips suggest by Thom Hogan and real life test, I concluded my unit has the problem.  The problem was very minor though...  To a point that I don't even want to send it to service.Next I compare the LCD screen with my old Nikon D90, at that time I notice that the LCD on my D90 is much cooler (in the sense that it's more bluish) and the D800 do have a yellow/greenish cast.  Finally, I also found a spot (pretty large, don't think that is dust) on the sensor.  So, unfortunately my unit has problem 2) and 3) too.Because of problem 1),2) and 3), I decided to send it in to service.Two and a half weeks after I sent my unit to Nikon Los Angeles repair center I received my unit back.  There are two things I really want to mention about the repair:1) Nikon website for tracking your repair is useless.  The status you see is not up to date.  For instance, even I check the status website daily, I receive my D800 back before any status update.2) I was told that they can change the color space of the D800 to look like D3, but I have to pay $30.  I disagree with them.  After a few phone calls, they escalate my case.  The final respond from the cooperate office is that the D800 is more accurate than ever, if I want the change, it would be consider is a modification, but not a repair, hence there must be a $30 fee.Finally I decided not to pay for the $30 fee.Having heard a person online sent his D800 for problem 1) repair received a D800 that has sharp left autofocus point,  but the originally sharp center point got messed up.  I redid all my test.Guess what, all problem gone =)  All focus points are sharp!  Oil spot on sensor is gone.  You might think it is my self protect mechanism, but I notice that if I compare the D90's LCD to the actual environment lighting, D90 LCD screen a bit too bluish, the D800's LCD is more accurate.  So yes, the D800 screen is more yellow compare to D90's, but I do feel it is more faithful to the environment actual lighting.  May be it's just me...Anyway, after a week with the repaired camera, I AM STILL AMAZED BY THE STUNNING DETAIL AND SHARPNESS this D800 can produce.  Also, the DYNAMIC RANGE IS SECOND TO NONE!  You can recover highlight and (especially) shadow like never before.  Coming from D90 (with some decent lenss), the ISO performance is amazing.  ISO1600 is very clean without any noise reduction.  ISO3200 and 6400 is useable with little work.  The only drawback is the heavy weight compare to my old D90.  But it is a worthy price to pay for the sturdiness and stability.As an off topic point, people trash D800 when comparing high iso noise with 5D mark III.  5d mark III OVERRATE THEIR ISO.  I do believe that the 5D mark III would perform better, but probably not by much.  If you google \"d800 noise Candlelight\", you will see a video the compare D800, 5D mark II and 5D mark III at different iso level.  You can see at the same ISO level, the D800 is much brighter than the others (people said about 2/3 to 1 stop difference).  So, conservatively D800's ISO1000 is like 5d mark III ISO 1600!!UPDATE - 4/3/2013 - A bonus from Nikon:Yesterday Nikon posted firmware update ( D800 A:1.01 / B:1.02).  Many people reported improved AF speed and accuracy.  I installed the firmware.  Tested non scientifically and found noticeable improvement!  Thank you Nikon!UPDATE - 4/25/2013I have upped 1 star to give the D800 five stars from my original 4 stars rating.  I have used the camera a lot recently.  After each shooting section when I check out the photos, I still always end up with a \"WOW\".  The crazy dynamic range and the sharpness is insane!

I was expecting months more of delay.Although its strength is certainly not action sports, I've photographed four high school lacrosse games with it thus far and the results have been phenomenal! (I have taken about 3500 images in 2 weeks.)  I've been using a Nikon 200mm f/2 lens and the new Nikon 2X teleconverter (III) for an effective FX 400mm f/4, and I'm getting incredible shots even at high ISO.I still have two original Nikon F bodies from the 1960s and early '70s, one D1X, a couple of D200, a D300, and a D7000 (plus a Fuji S-2 Pro and several old Nikon film cameras), but this is BY FAR the best Nikon I've used to date.  GREAT images.I have not yet tried it with any of Nikon's \"consumer\" lenses, but with the 300mm f/2.8, 85mm f/1.4, and 200mm f/2.0 it takes fantastic images--the kind once only possible with medium format cameras.I've only played with the video capabilities, but they, too, impressed me greatly.  Skin tones are the best I've ever seen, and focus has been quick and spot on.I can't imagine a DSLR that can compete with this for portrait, wedding, or landscape photography.  I've been using a monopod for sports photograph, but if circumstances permit would recommend using a tripod for portrait or landscapes to get the maximum quality out of the lens.  But I don't think that's essential -- the snapshots I've taken hand-held have been more than impressive.In summary, I highly recommend the D800.  GREAT tool.

It is as if like I bought a set of new lenses with the new camera. I am completely astonished by the output particularly in these three areas.- The Dynamic Range- ISO handling- Clarity/Detail of the picturesThe bokeh that I get(especially from the 85mm lens) is stunning. I am almost seeing the 3D effect on the portraits. I can easily crop the pictures without loosing any clarity.One of the main reasons for me to get the D800 against the D700 is the video capability and it did not fail me. Takes great quality videos. I do get the lens sound in the audio since I don't use the external mic. I may start to focus manually to avoid this.I do want to mention couple of things that I did not think great!

Overall, I have been very happy with the D800 but it is a different beast than my previous camera (a Nikon D7000) and I have had to make some adjustments to my shooting technique. It does seem to prefer higher shutter speeds than the D7000 to get consistently sharp results. This is not usually a problem as the sensor delivers outstanding high ISO performance - much better than the D7000 which was itself pretty darn good in low light.Compared to the D7000, the autofocus on the D800 is amazing. I often use the camera to shoot wildlife, especially birds, and the autofocus is almost always spot on. My rate of 'keepers' is much higher than with the D7000. Some people have complained about the slow frame rate of the D800 and that is a consideration if you are a sports/action shooter. However for wildlife, I need reach so I usually shoot the D800 in DX mode with the battery grip on which brings the FPS up to 6. Still not in D4 range of course, but fast enough for my purposes and still with plenty of resolution to boot.One of the great features of the D800 is the bright large finder - so much bigger and brighter than the D7000. The big finder makes it much easier to track wildlife. This is helpful even when you're shooting in DX mode as the D800 finder still gives you a 'full frame' field of view but with the DX image area outlined with a thin black line.Image quality is superb - even after two weeks I still find myself staring at the monitor sometimes, amazed at how much detail and subtlety this camera can render.I have shot the D800 with a range of Nikon lenses. One of my favourites is the 24-120 f4 VR -  relatively light, versatile and extremely sharp, even when shot wide open. I have also been very pleased with the 16-35 f4 VR - another relatively light and extremely sharp lens.My only complaints about the D800 are relatively minor. The main grip on the camera seems slightly undersized for my large hands and not as 'deep' as the D7000. I don't consider this a 'deal-breaker' but I am a bit disappointed with the 'feel' of the camera especially given its price point. Battery performance isn't as good as the D7000, but still perfectly adequate for a full days shooting.Minor quibbles aside, the D800 is an amazing camera.

There are a lot of technical reviews here so I'll give you more of my impressions.  A lot of people have said that the 36Mp is a waste unless you really spend the time to get it right and have good glass.  Fair enough, but I only buy Nikon ED glass.  I'm shooting with a 70-200mm f/2.8, 85mm f/1.4, and 24-70mm f/2.8.  But with very little effort, I'm getting shots that are spot on.  Although I find the AF can hunt more than I'd like in moderate light or low contrast, when it locks, it's generally dead on down to the pixel. I find this gives me a lot of range when adjusting the RAW files in Photoshop or Lightroom.  I'll skip another two generations before I buy another body but I don't think this one will disappoint.The only negative I've noted that has been published a lot is my screen occassionally shows a slight green tint.

Double megapixels (36.3MP) on double size of sensor (FX vs DX) It gives super details comparing with my current DX camera.  Especially when we can see details of eyes when taking portrait pictures.2. It can still take pictures during movie recording.3. Video recording up to 30 mins.4. DX Lens mode for increased distance, specially working prefectly for my Nikon 28-300mm (42-450mm DX mode) Lens, when I need distance support.5. Autofocus, I thought it might be not good, but it's quick with providing more focus points.6. Memory buffer, it has enough to catch around 20 on-going pictures.7. Storage, support both CF and SD UHS-1 (95MB/sce).Some concerns......1. MB-D12 Price, it looks like MB-D11 (D7000), but the price is way higher than MB-D11.2. 4 frames/sec, it might be good to increase to be similar as D7000 (6 frames/sec) and D800 dose have good memory buffer.

Out of the two, the 5d3 has the superior build and Canon after sales support is superior - I believe Canon QC is tighter and if I was using this gear to make money, then I would give strong consideration to these advantages. The Canon has probably the most advanced AF on the market and it is a faster camera which does a reasonably good job in shooting action.All that said, the Nikon has the superior sensor. Dynamic range is better - primarily in shadow detail and the complete absence of banding, the latter of which can show up with the 5d3 when shadows are fully pushed in post-processing. The 5d3 applies NR on the sensor, which results in pixel level smearing at high ISO (>6400). This is a subtle artifact that's not obvious at normal viewing sizes. In terms of JPG output, it's easier to get high quality high ISO shots out of the 5d3 because of it's more aggressive (but very well done) noise reduction.The story changes when shooting RAW. I have taken identical pictures with both camera - the d800/24-70 f/2.8 and the Canon 5d3/35L. Both shot at 35mm/2.8/ISO6400. I downsized the d800 picture and applied the exact same level of sharpening and luminance noise reduction to both files. When examining both pics at pixel level, I would say that the (very slight) edge goes to the d800. This is by virtue of it's superior shadow noise performance and retention of detail in the shadows. At normal viewing sizes on my retina display macbook pro, the d800 and 5d3 (when normalized to the same image size) have essentially identical noise performance.At base ISO, in normal lighting conditions, the d800 has far superior detail - by virtue of it's higher resolution and DR. The resolution, color, sharpness are absolute top tier. With an excellent lens like the 24-70, the images are absolutely stunning.Color is what you make of it in processing and what your lens renders. the d800/24-70 produces great color - I see no disadvantage (or advantage) relative to the 5d3.AWB is better on the d800 compared to the Canon. Again, when shooting RAW, this is not a big deal.Shooting with the 24-70, the d800 has exceptional AF accuracy. It is stunningly accurate in low light conditions. The 5d3 is also excellent, but I cannot say it's better or worse, given the different lenses used. AF speed is highly dependent on the lens used - with the 24-70, it's essentially instantaneous.At f/2.8, my camera body has accurate L/R AF banks. There can be field curvature issues with certain lenses, but at f/2.8, the sharpness at the lateral banks are accurate. The L bank AF issue is real for some people - it's primarily an issue in bodies shooting wide open with prime lenses. That said, most full frame cameras have imperfect edge AF sensor performance and most lenses have issues rendering images with perfect sharpness at the edge of the frame.Bottom line - these cameras are very close, but if you are looking for the best absolute image quality, the d800 provides it. In order to extract the kind of noise performance that levels the playing ground with the Canon, you must shoot RAW. When doing so, there is no difference in high ISO performance. If you value great high ISO performance with straight out of camera JPGs, then the 5d3 has the advantage. Otherwise, the DR and resolution of the d800 is pretty incredible and represents the next level in performance.

After my D700 was stolen, I immediately bought another one because I had to keep working.  While I had the new D700, I decided to try the D800.  I only had it for 2 weeks and after understanding that it was not the reliable work horse like the D700, I sent the D700 back and kept the D800.  Why?  because it is amazing the creative range you have with this camera.  As an event shooter I was concerned about the file sizes...no problem, all sorts of flexibility there.  For regular event actions shots, I shoot at 20MP, for portrait shots, i use the full 36MP.  With a full frame lens on, I can shoot in dx mode and get 1.5 times the normal length...at 15MP.  With my batter grip and dx 15mp mode, I get a reasonably fast FPS...not sure on the number yet.Picture quality:  better than the D700, in terms of noise and color range. I can pull more sharpness out of the image too without the noise.  Low light:  it is even better than the D700!  I shoot in auto ISO a lot with this camera, because I know it will get me an image with low noise.Issues:  there is an occasional lockup...which could be fatal in event shooting.  However, it did not happen during my last event...because I shot in JPG fine for the actions shots and raw for posed shots.  I had so much information in the JPEG files that it was like pulling from a raw file.Why did I take off one star?  because I am not yet comfortable with the lock up possibilities.  I believe it has to do with the cards you use.  I hear Lexar cards have been developed with Nikon.

I realized my version 3 of Lightroom needed to be upgraded as well as my entire computer system.A dual core with an older Mobo just will not cut it with 60MB+ RAW images - unless you are willing to spend lots of time waiting for each slider or process to take effect after you perform it. But I often shoot 2-600 images at a clip, and I was not prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of time editing them.  In Lightroom 4.1 to go from one magnified image (with sliders adjusted, sharpened, denoised, etc) to another for comparison took me 10-15 seconds, depending on the image- and that with pre-loaded 100% previews!Now I am upgrading to an 8 core with a modern mobo, so that should move things along (just ordered from Amazon).But as far as the camera is concerned, it's fantastic. Only reason I didn't get it at Amazon is because it was not in stock at the time I \"desperately\" needed it (when the finance minister - wife- approved it).Mine has one hot pixel and a slight BF issue on most of my lenses. Far edge focus sensor is a little off, but it is tolerable. Most of the time I will just move the camera to place the main subject into the center and then return it for composition anyway (yes, I know the arguments against that). When I really need the edge points to be sharp is only in studio shooting and then I will be using live view anyway.I am shooting it for a few weeks to see if anything else rears its ugly head and then sending it to Melville for a complete once-over from Nikon.  Ordered an aftermarket battery grip that uses the D4 battery, so I've shot all day without having to recharge.  Focus is super fast no matter what lens is attached.  Just make sure you check bf/ff issues and adjust accordingly before you take it into the field. Checking full sized resolution, it is definitely an improvement over the D700.

These cameras are a good five years apart, so I may have a slightly different perspective from some.Pros:- The resolution is killer (but yes, be prepared to deal with your computer chugging with all of that data!)- The sensor really does record an amazing amount of data (take a look at DXOmark giving this and the D800E its highest scores).  This means I can recover more in raw, but it also just means nicer color in general.- The color in high-ISO and incandescent situations is SO BALANCED, compared to my D300 which basically just gave red, this is worlds better.  For D700/etc. users, this may not pop out as a big change.Cons:- In five years, the features haven't changed all that much.  Which is fine, I guess!- The video is hard to control and get used to.  Hard to pull a focus without looking through the viewfinder, but it's set up so you can't (unless I'm missing something).- The LCD screen still isn't bright enough, if you want to use LiveView at the beach you will be laughing at your overexposed results when you get home.- \"Quiet\" shutter mode isn't quiet, it's basically worthless.Neutral:- The \"green tint\" thing is true, though I'm sure they'll fix that soon with firmware.- The shutter is fairly loud, it sounds like a guillotine slicing through a neck.  Some may like this, it's pretty badass-sounding.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.  I think DSLR video still has a ways to go, the alternate focusing method during LiveView is pretty worthless and so unless I buy a $1k screen to mount on top, I'll never be able to shoot proper handheld video and see what I'm doing.  I think I was too optimistic about what I would be able to do on that front.When you buy a camera body, you're mostly buying the chip.

The idea that when you address one weak link you have to address all of the others too is flat out silly. For many DSLR owners today the \"weakest link\" is the resolution of their camera's sensor. Replacing that camera with one that uses a better sensor will improve most or all of the new owner's pictures and will degrade NONE of them.Yes, addressing other weak links will improve them more ... but the new camera doesn't demand that any be addressed. If I replace my camera with a D800, I will change neither my lenses nor my techniques. Replacing my lenses would not be cost effective, I already stabilize my camera as well as circumstances permit, my choice of f-stop is dictated by many factors, none of which is the onset point of diffraction blur, and my choice of shutter speed is dictiated by factors other than, \"Will there be pixel level blur because I'm hand holding the camera?\".", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "A game changer and worthy successor to the D700", "Author": "Gizmo", "ReviewID": "R36PROFTVQCL6F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The D800 changes the game with 36.3 MP FX, 15.3 MP DX and HD video capability in one body.  What's not to like about that?  It's like having a D4/D3x in a smaller format or a D7000 with better ergonomics.  I know that may be an oversimplification, but to me that is the reality of it.Pros:- 36.3 MP:  What can I say that hasn't already been said.  If you use good glass and employ the right techniques you can expect stunning results.- 25 MP: 1.2 Crop.  Emulate a Cannon or D3x resolutions.- 15.4 MP DX Mode:  Worried that you can't use your D800 as a walk around camera without having to haul around a tripod to mitigate image blurring with the 36 MP sensor?  Just bolt on a DX lens with good IQ and VR and shoot hand held all day and be happy.  I've been using a Nikon 16-85mm VR and I am getting excellent results.  This technique allows me to shoot hand held, focus on the shot and not fret over the potential image blur.- Expeed 3 metering:  The meter on the D800 is so much better than the D700 good that it's hard to know where to begin.  The Expeed 2 meter in both the D700 (and to a greater extent on the D7000) had a tendency to overexpose in high contrast scenes.  Not the D800.  You still have to pay attention to the histogram and make exposure adjustments accordingly but it not anywhere as problematic as the D700.-HD Video:  This was a feature lacking on my D700 and I am really impressed with what Nikon has done here.  During my last photo shoot in Yosemite National Park I ended up shooting more video than still photography  and the results were very good.  Maybe not Pro, but still very good.-Live View:  The implementation of Live View on the D800 is a huge improvement over the D700.  Live View is an important technique for successfully shooting FX with this beast.  Yes, if you zoom in too far you get pixilation but who cares?  I'm looking for sharp focus not sharpness in the LCD at this point.Cons:Battery Life:  I burned through mine very quickly during my first photo shoot.  Not surprising considering all the horse power under the hood.  Just buy and carry more batteries.  Problem solved.Bracketing:  All the right features are there but shooting a bracket set in FX will be problematic due to  excessive mirror vibration and resulting image blur.  One workaround is shooting DX for serious HDR type work.  The D4 is probably a better choice for hard core HDR shooters IMHO.Sensor blur: The reality is that you will see image blur with 36 MP and 24 MP FX sensors.  Nikon addresses this in their \"D800 Technical Guide\".  The most important thing to understand is that 36 MP FX is great for some situations and maybe not the right choice for others.  So use what works.  For me, that means using a good tripod and Live View in some situations or using Auto-ISO and a fast minimum shutter speed in others.  Shooting in DX mode at 15.3 MP is another alternative that works well for hand held use.Conclusion:I still think the D700 is still a very relevant option for those who don't need the video capability.  The Nikon D4 hits the sweet spot IQ wise for those who can afford to drop $6K on one.  The Nikon D800 is for the rest of us and has allot of the same magic as the D4.

The high pixel count does not impair sharpness and allows for cropping in post.  Dynamic range is stellar.

Speed of shooting may not address the needs of sport or high speed nature photography, but adding a power grip or shooting in DX mode may help.  I have absolutely no left focus or oil problems whatsoever (despite my pre-purchase fears).  The clear bright viewfinder reminds me of my F100 film camera.  The size and weight is greater than a DX body, but very manageable, especially compared to the D4.  The feel of the grip on the hand is very comfortable.  Depth of field on an FX sensor is amazing.

In short, I saw no reason to buy a D800.So I waited until March 2013. I've had it a month now. Here's my summary of the D800 with respect to the D700:- better low-light performance- better dynamic range- better AF- astonishing resolution when paired with a pro lens, literally feels like a 10x gain, even though its nothing close- video! ... but don't ever confuse this with a run-and-gun camcorder.- it's quieter- smarter Auto ISO with the 1/focal length rule of thumb- time lapse- 100% viewfinderCons:- Google \"D800 video\". You will never ever make videos of this quality, unless you're a pro and your D800 is attached to a ton of very expensive equipment. My videos of my toddler are awful. Better than an iPhone, but not by much. Video AF is useless, and manual focus is really tough.- Audio for videos is terrible, as expected. I guess they include it so you'll have something, but it's not suitable for anything except a terrible video of your kids.- 4 fps is rather slow. But I don't need anything faster.

My camera was getting old quick and due to the nature of my work shutter count started going over 150k. I still love my Canon but slow AF and some other glitches ware the main reasons to start considering a new camera.I tested both new models of Nikon and Canon and both were great cameras. I don't know why some people say that one is better than the other; I think they're just both great cameras and none of them is going to make you a better photographer. I've seen some great photos taken with an iPhone and terrible ones with 25k medium format cameras.Initially, I was planing to buy a Canon 5D mkIII but also decided to try my friend's Nikon D800. The only thing that really disappointed me a lot about Canon was a big price change but not so much of an improvement. To me it felt more like what Canon 5D mkII should had been in the beginning. I don't think that the improvements on a new Canon justify additional $1,500 increase. So, I felt like I'm being fooled by Canon. If price is not an issue new Canon is incredible!Other than \"unjust\" price of Canon 5d mkIII, I also like that Nikon D800 has a built-in flash which, I think they could have made sturdier. It feels a little flimsy and in my mind I'll be always thinking about being extra careful about bumping my camera into things where with my Canon I was not an issue. Also, I very much like the detail and depth of field that D800 surprised me with, which may not necessary be a good thing because to some it may look too good and thus unnatural. Other than that both cameras are more than any one would ever need.The thing I like the most about full frame cameras is that they don't get upgraded as often as non-full frame cameras. Even my 3 years old Canon 5D mkII still takes pictures more to my liking than most DSLRs on a market - this is a big plus for me to consider a full frame camera, except for the fact the censor is LARGE.I wanted to buy my D800 from Amazon but due to the fact that some cameras have problems with the AF, I decided to go through a regular store where I can test the camera before buying it. And sure thing, it took me two cameras to find the one without the problem.My addiction to Canon is limited by only two lenses, so the switch wasn't painful. I would strongly recommend getting Nikon 24-70 2.8f lens for your D800, you can get it used in excellent condition for no more than $1,500 on eBay or Amazon. I tried 24-120 4f and wasn't happy - terrible distortion, slow AF, and poor built quality for the price.Overall, Nikon D800 and Canon 5DIII are both awesome cameras. None is better than the other.

The D800 is in a league of it's own. Better dynamic range, much improved image resolution (the D700 was just begging for more resolution, 12MP is lacking at times), dual memory card slots, and importantly, 100% viewfinder. It still retains great low light capability similar to the D700. The only drawback I can say is, it would be nice to have smaller sized RAWs as an option, as the full resolution RAW files truly is huge, and makes viewing of files in the camera very difficult (5-10 second lag between each photo), with slow SD cards. Also, processing in lightroom or any other photo processing software now requires a much more powerful computer.If you are in the market for the D800, you may also want to consider the D600, which is a great alternative to the D800, considering that it is $1000 cheaper.The differences between the D800 and D600 are as such: Both have 100% viewfinder. The D600 is lighter and smaller. The D800 has slightly higher image quality/resolution, and higher max shutter speed (if you are shooting wide open in extremely bright settings). The D800 has pro control buttons, rather than the spin dial of the D600. The D800 also has a more sturdy pro body construction.Given a choice to purchase the D800/D600 (since I had purchased the D800 before the D600 was released), I would likely go with the D800 again, mainly because of the more sturdy pro body construction, and the pro control buttons.You will want to check for AF focus issues, and also viewfinder issues, with the D800 as mentioned by many of the other reviewers.

I read one review indicating that this is not for newbies.. yes this is for newbies who knows the basic relationship between iso shutter speed and apeture..why??  because of the dynamic range!! even if u shot over or under exposed (as long as it was not too over or too under exposed) you can easily tweek it in post processing and you gain back all the details, you need to shoot in RAW!  Gel on flash? forget it! the new sensor just works in regards to WB. I shot portraits outside on a sunny day no gel and the skin just came out warm and perfect, no blue color cast on the eyes even on studios.  Autofocus? again it just works.. shot at f2 using 85 1.4g, a boy with balloons on a distance, and again dead on .. boy/balloon in focus.. btw balloon is about 3 feet away from the boy to his right.  TTL flash mode, yes again it just works! Nikon did a good job on this, just review the histrogram and boom!! no need for a light meter.  I use 24 1.4 all the time on events, now i dont use the 50 1.4, because of the cropping capability you get the 50 mm equivalent still at 25 megapixel, details are still very visible.  Prints? shot a pictorial of a 2 yr old after i printed i have two more costumers referred by the mother of the boy.  AMAZING details!!  noise? yes there is noise, use noise ninja your problem is solve plus bec of high pixels you keep most of the details even after noise post processing.  Video? i dont do videos.

A great camera that really got me into wildlife photography due to the D7000's high resolution and great focusing capabilities. I always told myself that I would get into FX when a 24mp sensor became affordable (meaning no more than $3000).So, when Nikon announced the D800 I immediately took the plunge. As I waited for months for the D800 to ship I read everything I could, including reviews, user manuals, field tests etc. When I finally got the camera I and used it for a week, I was a little let down. Files loaded slower, I found my 14-24 had serious corner softness issues, my software programs kept crashing, and it was soon obvious that there were not many methods available to actually see the benefits of all that extra resolution. This camera was ahead of its time.Now that I have used the D800 for a few months, I am getting a better handle on my technique and it is showing in the photographs I take. The high ISO capability, the 36mp, the incredible focus system, instant response, and advanced features mean only one thing. The weak link is now me. Changing your sloppy photo habits takes time! But it does happen. Its not so much that my photos now look better to me, but when I look back at my old stuff I almost feel sick.  Why did I not pay attention to my aperture setting or where I focused? Why did I not buy better lenses back then? (I am now!)This camera challenged me to be better. The many complaints I read on the web directed at this camera should be directed at the user. I think the folks who have had the toughest time are those who were already in the FX world, owning such cameras as the D700 or D3. The resolution of the D800 is 3 times those cameras.  Coming from the DX world. the resolution was already there, but in a sensor area 2.3 times smaller in area.  A D800 set to the DX mode is about the same as a D7000. Both put high demands on lenses.  The D800 puts additional stress on the corners of these lenses that the DX mode did not.My point is this. Once you adjust to the incredible resolution this camera provides, you just cannot go back.

In another review on the D7000, I noted the AF needed fine tuning on that camera. Basically it back focused. To correct this, on the Nikon calibration scale, it needed a \"-4\" to move the focus forward into the correct location. You can move it Plus or Minus 20 steps to correct for focus shifts.As the 36.5MP on the D800 will show a lot of detail, it is essential the focus be in the correct position you need. Shifted focus will be glaringly obvious.So, I took the D800 and ran the calibration test and lo and behold, it needed a \"-5\" to correct for it's back focus issue.What is it with higher end Nikons and back focusing? I'm 2 for 2 on that.With that issue under control, I love this camera. The picture quality is stunning. You can shoot and then crop in tight and who knew?

While very happy with it at the time, I always dreamed of moving to a full frame sensor camera sometime in the future.  I have held out this long waiting for a camera like the D800.  Initially though I was going to buy the D4.  Impossible as it may seem I did not know the D800 was coming out.  Once I discovered it was to be released soon and read some about it I changed my mind and put myself on the waiting list with Service Photo here in Maryland.  I did not have to wait long.I got a call two days after release to come pick up my camera!  I picked it up and rushed home to play with my new toy.  I took it to several family events.  The results were always decent.  Of course, I used only the center focus point so I never saw any bad problems with focusing.  My pictures were never tack sharp, always slightly soft.  I rationalized it away to poor technique on my part.While on a photography outing with a friend we discussed the issue with focusing that my camera was displaying.  He mentioned reading online about an issue with focusing on the D800.  I resolved to research it more once home.  The more I read, the more anxious I became.I went to Mansurovs Blog and read up on The Nikon D800 / D800E Asymmetric Focus Issue.  I decided to perform the testing this site recommends.  My camera failed, miserably.  Using a Nikon 50mm f/1.4G lens to perform the testing I discovered the center focus point was soft.  I, of course knew this already.  The right focus point was even softer and the left focus point was simply horrible.  Upset does not even describe how I felt.I was past the return period.  It was suggested on many forums to return the camera to your local vendor and let them send it back for repair.  I did not like this option as it means another set of hands between me and Nikon.  I decided to send it in for repair directly myself.Many will probably say \"Use the center focus point like you were and just use the camera as is.\"  My answer to this statement is \"I paid $3000 and deserve a camera that functions as advertised.\"I went to [...], logged into my account, and went to MY NIKON.  I submitted a simple question to nikon.  Where can I go on their site to check if my D800 is affected by the focus issue?I received this response the next day.  \"After researching your question about the D 800 focus problem that you are experiencing, we have received information in regards to the issue. Our service department has requested for you to send your camera in to be evaluated. Please use the below link to send your camera into Nikon. URL: [...] There is no need to call in advance for any approval or authorization; simply send the product in for evaluation with no accessories, unless part of the issue, and a photocopy of the receipt. Once logged in, service will send you a confirmation. Thank you for your patience. Nikon Technical Support.\"That link allows you to create an automated return form for your equipment.  You need to properly pack your camera to protect from damage and include the following:  1. A copy of the packing list created from the link above.  2.  Photocopy of your receipt.  3.  Explanation letter.4.  Optional (but should be done): A disk or an SD card with your test images to prove the problem.  NOTE:  Remove all accessories from your camera before sending!  If you include a SD card with test images you will get it back.  As a matter of fact I got back everything I sent in to the service center.I shipped the package to the Melville, NY Service Center on 7/30/2012.  It was delivered the following day. It was not logged into their tracking system until 8/6/2012.  Order Status:  Order Accepted.  Code was 25480, Serial 30039XX, Service Rank Repair B1, Category B1, Problem:  Focus, Focus Issues-sample images included, TO GWO.  Then came the wait...I presume because they had so many needing repair.Three days latter the order status changed to IN SHOP.  It stayed this way until 8/17/2012 when I was verbally told the status was now AT QUALITY CHECK STATION.  One day latter I received the camera and all material including paperwork and disk I sent in back via UPS.  No damage to camera from their process at all.  I was very happy so far.  Attached my 50 and took some pictures of family indoors. WOW!  We are talking Night and Day difference in camera's behavior.  Focusing is snappy and dead on!  Swapped to my 70-300mm f/4-5.6G.  Before, this lens would \"hunt\" a lot.  Now, it just snaps in focus, no hunting.  I could not be happier now.  Nikon has made me happy.So, in a nutshell.  I am completely satisfied now with my new camera.  The Nikon D800 is awesome.  I am glad I bought it.  It should have come out of the box perfect.  It did not, but Nikon's Service Center made good on the repair and now I have what I believe is probably a D800 in better shape than most coming out of the box new, even if they have no apparent problems.I was anxious about shipping a $3K camera back to Nikon and getting something better back, but Nikon came through!  I was nervous the entire time it was gone.  It seemed an eternity!  It was out of my hands for 18 days.  It was worth the wait!

It is simply ridiculous how this issue escaped any QA, as more and more people are reporting issues.On the plus side:* the resolution of the 36MP sensor is unreal.* 24-70/2.8 (35mm and longer), 85/1.8G,  70-200/2.8 VR2 worked wonders on this camera.* the video files are sharp , crisp and detailed. definitely better than the average camcorder.* AF (aside from the left AF point) is definitely faster and more accurate than D700.* High ISO performance a tad better than D700 as well.To conclude : good luck playing the lottery.

I teach video production, and do freelance work with music videos and small projects for companies.  I've received so much praise for the image, but most of that is the camera.  With the less expensive 50mm Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, it makes such a beautiful image, you'll really be happy with its performance with video. Yeah, the biggest issue I found for video is moire patterns (especially in brick and some cloth), but I deal with it through filters.  You can run into rolling shutter issues, but usually it is the user creating the issue, as most DSLRs have the same issue. I bought a lot of extra equipment for using this as a DSLR including a small rig Fancierstudio FL02M DSLR RIG With Follow Focus And Matte Box and a viewfinder GGS Perfect Foldable LCD Viewfinder 3X Magnification for Canon, Nikon, Sony and Other DSLR Cameras by CowboyStudio (ggs3.0x LCDVF).

It really is a quality product and I get about 6 hours of video shooting from the battery pack (and I still have two Nikon batteries for the camera as backup!)As for stills, I am still in awe of the camera's powers.  It is an advanced camera that needs a skilled user.  There are almost no automatic settings on the D800.  Be prepared to use Manual/Shutter/Aperature priority modes only.  I only shoot in manual, as I prefer the control.  One common complaint is that it only does 4fps stills.  If you want a higher fps for sports photography, this isn't the camera for you.  And the ability to crop is near amazing.  One word of caution, with such high megapixel, you really need to know what you are doing with focusing.  it because really clear something isn't focused with the images that this camera produces.If you'd like to see some examples of what this camera can do, check out a couple music videos I shot using the D800:Elmira - I shot this on the D800 using the 55mm.

Before the new lens arrived I did a lot of research on the D800 and the 5D MK III.  I returned the Canon lens unopened; I had to have the D800.  For a variety of reasons including D800 availability, I waited a few months before buying.  I expected to wait 2-3 months for delivery, but Amazon had them in stock and I received mine within four days of ordering: kudos to Amazon.As most reviewers have indicated, the camera is amazing so I'll try not to be repititious.  When I did my research, a combination of factors (vs my 5D) convinced me to buy:1)  After 20 years of large format photography, image quality is paramount to me and the 36mp really delivers.  I had not expected such an improvement over the 5D's 22mp, but it is there.  However as many have said, good lenses are a must.  I started with Nikon's 17-35mm f2.8 zoom and I would only use similar quality glass on the D800.2)  I find the ease of use of the D800 to be far superior to the 5D.  I'm able to use a few buttons to quickly change key settings whereas the 5D often forced me to go into screen menus which slowed me down.3)  The D800's bracketing ability was a real strong selling point for me as I do a significant amount of HDR work.  The D800 allows you to easily set and make up to nine bracketed exposures.  The 5D only allows up to three bracketed exposures at a time and you needed to go into on line screens (twice for a nine exposure sequence) to reset bracketing.  The Nikon is significantly faster in this regard and less prone to getting knocked out of alignment by avoiding the bracketing adjustment process required on the 5D.  In short, if you want to do a lot of HDR easily, this body is for you.4) The AF system on the Nikon is much better and faster than on the 5D (though the 5D MK III system is supposed to be much improved).5) The D800 was $500 cheaper than the new 5D MK III.  I'm sure the MK III is a fine instrument but it didn't have the feature set of the D800 and therefore it was an easy decision for me.6) Two card slots and an on board flash top off the list of pluses for me.Two minor negatives: I wish the second card slot had been for CF cards but I' suspect it was a packaging issue for the engineers.

In fact, this is a level of resolution that, until now, has been reserved for medium format cameras like the Hasselblad.  When you zoom into 100%, you will be amazed at the clarity and quality of the image.  It's amazing when you first see it.This camera also has the most advanced autofocusing system in the market today, and is identical to the brand new Nikon D4. It will focus in near complete darkness, which means it can use slower lenses that may have a maximum aperture of only f/5.6, and it will still focus quickly and accurately, even in low ambient light.This new focusing system has a much better 'face detection' feature than any other Nikon. Of course it can be turned on or off. When on, it will almost always find a face in scene and focus on it. This makes shooting receptions much easier.It also has an outstanding exposure system and jpeg engine.  The D800 exposures are so perfect that I won't need to do much post processing, so I am considering going back to jpegs for non-critical parts of the wedding, like the bride getting dressed and the reception. I'm thinking of doing this mainly to save disk space, because the raw images are huge. A 14 bit lossless compressed raw image is about 41 MB! A large fine jpeg is about 16 MB.  You can't edit these files on a mediocre computer.  You'll need a fairly powerful computer to process these files.Another wonderful thing about the D800 is the high ISO performance. It is hard for me to believe that I can actually shoot images at ISO 6400 that have less noise than the D3! And the noise seems easier to remove with noise reduction in Lightroom. I am amazed, since until now, all of the high resolution cameras also had relatively poor high ISO performance. At this time, the only Nikon camera that has better noise performance is the D4, and it is very close.Batery performance is also very good.

Others speak better to those items better than I could.I do recommend that you research a few items before you decide to purchase.Buyers need to be aware that this camera generates a form of RAW files which CANNOT BE PROCESSED with Lightroom 3.6 and some older PS. Upgrade to Lightroom 4 you say?  Sure, as long as your computer doesn't use XP, because LR7 apparently only works with Windows 7.  Going to 7 on my old laptop isn't such a smart move, so you see what that means?  Yep, a possible computer upgradeAnd you need to budget for some serious CF and SD cards and a multi card reader (my laptop only processes SD).  The write speed on the cards needs to be very high to keep the continuous shutter moving along which drives up the prices substantially.  I'm going on a trip soon, and to work with these images at all when I return, I have arranged the cards to store RAW on CF, and JPEG on SD, so that when I get home I can at least have something to play with.  But that eliminated my initial plan of using the two cards as redundant RAW storage, so on this trip I will more or less 'waste' precious card space just to save JPEGs so I can start to sort through my images.The software that is provided with the D800 - VIEW NX2, should help me convert RAW into a format that LR3.6 can work with (I think, but haven't figured that out yet), but there is yet another step in post.Other thing you will have to abandon/replace is your wireless remote control ML-L3 (it won't work either), and the recommended remote control for the D800 is corded, which I hate.  A fairly minor issue considering the quality of the images, but still, I loved that little thing.Overall I'm very happy with the camera, it's features and image quality, just wanted to pass along some of what I discovered to be slightly unexpected costs to upgrade so that you don't order it and find yourself having to do like me and spend a bit more than expected to ensure functionality.  In my case, to make things work I needed significant investment in cards for storage (but again, glad to have such high resolution files to store!), and am looking at an eventual upgrade to Lightroom 4 or new PS, probably a new computer, new remote, and spare battery, etc.  Check some of the photo blogs for very important discussions going on about these things - the Lightroom issue is generating ALOT of heat and rightfully so, as many just bought LR3.6 are having to buy LR4 months later.Made the decision to do so because I have one of those 'trip of a lifetime' coming up next week, and feel good about bringing home a few BIG keepers!", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "D800 Locking UP", "Author": "George B.

And it is an outstanding sensor. It has very high resolution (36MP), very good high-ISO performance, and a color fidelity not seen in previous Nikon digital cameras. The pictures coming from this sensor are downright stunning.The camera features are OK. Only 4FPS, but when you consider the high bandwidth needed for pushing 36MP, that was to be expected. Somewhat disappointingly, Nikon decided to cripple the 16MP DX-format output to just 5FPS, even though the camera clearly is capable of more. You do get \"HD\" video, but I haven't been very impressed by the video output. You certainly aren't getting 2MP of video resolution. Besides, any old camera has video these days.Overall, single lens reflex technology is starting to look old, and Nikon is not doing much innovation to keep it up to date. Even though the D800 has an improved AF module, edge and corner auto-focus points are inaccurate, and even the center AF points can be hit-and-miss. It seems the auto-focus is not able to keep up with the high megapixel count. It would be nice if Nikon offered something like focus-bracketing to compensate for the inaccuracy inherent in using phase-detect auto-focus, but no such luck. Phase-detection AF in general is getting long in the tooth, compared to the new mirror-less cameras out there that offer extremely fast and accurate contrast-detect auto-focus. Nikon's version of contrast-detect AF, available in \"live-view\" mode, is sluggish and inaccurate by comparison.This of course assumes the AF module works in the first place. There is some kind of manufacturing defect with the AF module in the D800, causing the left AF points to be wildly off, especially when using fast wide-angle lenses. I have tried three D800 cameras, and they all have this problem. I strongly suspect this issue affects all D800 camera bodies to varying degrees.Given that your new D800 is likely to have the same AF issue, and given that the sensor is so demanding it will expose every single flaw of every one of your lenses, expect to send both your camera and lenses in to Nikon for service. And this is where the bad news begins.... Nikon service & support is very poor. In my experience, they are slow to respond, and repairs are sloppy. It usually takes a week or even two for technical support to get back to me, and another two-three weeks for service to evaluate the camera or lens. And even then, they almost never take the issue seriously on the first try, meaning you have to send the camera back in for a re-repair, which takes another three-four weeks. My D800 has been in for service twice, and I still have the same auto-focus issue, so I have to send it in a third time. Overall this means I will end up being without my new camera for a total of three months since purchasing it. Be ready for a similar experience! I think this level of service is unacceptable given the price point of this camera, and things have gotten worse since they closed down the El Segundo call center recently.Finally, a note on the D800 and Nikkor lenses: the 36MP D800 sensor exceeds manufacturing tolerance on Nikkor lenses. I have tried multiple copies of the new 85mm f/1.8 for example, and they all show tilted lens elements. The same is the case with the 50mm f/1.8. Same with the new 24-85 f/3.5-4.5 VR. Each type of lens shows it's own kind of deviations, but interestingly, the defects are the same across samples, indicating a manufacturing issue. This isn't necessarily a big deal unless you plan to do landscape photography or other critical work where sharpness across the entire field is important. But it's something to be aware of if you plan to take maximum advantage of the high-resolution sensor. Apart from that, many Nikkor lenses resolve surprisingly well on the D800. You are going to have far more trouble getting sharp pictures due to focusing inaccuracy and camera shake than due to soft lenses!Given the difficulties inherent in taking full advantage of the high-resolution sensor, and the well-known defects with the AF module, it's worth considering carefully if it's worth it before you buy.

Nikon was preparing to take on Canon & medium format at the same time. When I starting looking to upgrade my 5D MK2 of course I looked at the 5D mk3. However I never followed Nikon much and did not know about the D800/D800E. So it just popped up on screen while searching some online stuff about the 5D mk3. When I saw the specs I thought it was too good to be true. So I watched many videos, and looked at many photos. After reviewing all these things I decided to rent a D800 with Nikkor 85mm, and 50mm 1.4G's.I was completely blown away! The image resolution is unmatched! There isn't a camera or DSLR under $12k that even comes close to this resolution and package! After rental time was complete I listed all my canon gear and lenses and purchased a D800E. I will write a review for the D800E on that page, you can view that one over there. The D800 has no moire issues at all. I shot landscape, portraits, clothes, indoor, and buildings. I shot wide open, and 14-24mm and never had any issues. Focus was great, my rental did not have any negative issues whatsoever.If you are looking to get a new DSLR this is the one to get! If you are shooting Canon like I was, then it is still definitely worth the switch!Video Mode: The video mode has a histogram instead of a EV meter, which is actually more accurate.

Transferring and loading files this large can be an arduous task on the fastest computers; be prepared for a time commitment. Another thing.. I'm not sure why all the reviews tend to rave about this camera for low ISO noise, to me this thing is noisy as s***.From day 1 of ownership, I struggled with a frozen viewfinder when shooting in live view mode. I quickly exchanged it for a second D800 with an identical issue. I've heard similar complaints from several friends who own the camera as well, lagging and freezing are hardly anomalies with this beast. Eventually these issues forced me to give up on the camera all together and exchange it for the D600. At just shy of $3000, major hardware issues were not something I was willing to overlook in a brand new camera.The camera takes fantastic images, but unless you plan on making billboard prints, 36MPs seems to be way too high.

Transitioning from a D90/D300/D700 or pro camera reduces the learning curve. The plus side of this is that you have many ways to make the cameras work like you want.While image size is a concern to many, the D800 offers over a dozen ways to reduce file size and image sizes. But when you start using it you'll forget all about the file sizes.You really need to print large images to see what the D800 delivers. If you're extremely happy with your D90/D700/D7000, and/or do not make prints larger than 16 x 20, do not crop much - then stick with your camera. Still want to move from DX to FX, the D700 is very viable and worthy of consideration.Many say you have to have excellent holding techniques to get well focused images - I used a D7000 for a little over a year and found it work to get well focused images. The D800 is a pleasure to work with. But some may have to learn better hand holding techniques.If you want the ultimate of the what camera can deliver with very large prints -  disregard my comments above!

I finally sold my faithful F100 film camera after buying the D700.  Needless to say up until recently I use the D700 almost on every outing; and love it - it is a wonderful camera that does a fantastic job at digital photography.Now I have a D800! So the first thing I notice is the layout and build difference; the D800 is not as ergonomic and slightly smaller bodiedThe build materials of the D800 are of similar composition as compared to the D700 but the D700 feels solid and less plastic than the D800.Overall, it does not take too much time to get use to the new layout as most buttons and dials are similarly placed ad do the same functions.Image quality of the D800 is for most all circumstances remarkable and this comes at the cost of larger file sizes.-- Media management becomes critical when your talking about 38mb + per shot - your storage solution and backup plans need to keep up with the file size increase.The benefit of larger resolution is you have better cropping options. Meaning, photos can be zoomed in to show more details.The main feature I was looking for with this camera was to use it for my Macro (MICRO) photography - bugs and plants, so having more resolution is better.I decided to go with the D800 vice D800E after many months of research, the simply fact is not that much difference between the two and I simply don't want to deal with the moire issues.Not that the D800E has Moire issues, I simply don't wish to increase my probability of running across subjects that would create moire.  I will stick with the D800 for now.Things I worry about as an outdoor photographer - DUST. With a sensor now having this many pixels packed on. It would be obvious to deduct dust would be more of a problem.Good thing - if you are using Nikon pro lens they have a weather seal where it attaches to the camera, and the camera itself is moisture and dust resistant. Time will tell.Movie Mode: This has been around for awhile, and the D800 has some nice features with many shooting modes to choose from, such as 24 frames for that indie look. The movie features are comparable to any of the other PRO DSLRs out there just youtube it. The D800 has continuous focus and supports external mic in and does a great job with movie production.Overall I am pleased with the D800 Camera and the initial performance.Unlike others I don't put a camera under a microscope and go looking for defects unless a problem impacts my shooting, then I look for the root cause and have it addressed.  So far I don't see any issues, focus or otherwise.Finally, I appreciate the ability to set up a \"My Menu\" in the camera; with the press on on button I can go direct to my menu to make changes to some of my favorite settings without having to go to the main menu and drill into sub menus.  Overall the menu system works pretty well and things are laid out reasonably well + you can re-program buttons to perform other functions.Now for the whining;The D800 is a great camera for those that can afford it, and had the D4 offered more resolution (24mp) I would have invested in that over the D800.I do feel the D800 is about $800.00 over priced as are all the pro level Nikon cameras, but people don't want their older Nikon cameras devalued so Nikon keeps trucking along with overpricing.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "My First DSLR", "Author": "R T", "ReviewID": "R32WBKAM6WSHMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I heart this camera!  Its my first DSLR and I was nervous I had bought too much camera for a newbie.  Yes, I could probably have a lot of fun with an entry level camera, but I knew I wanted to hit the photography ground running.  I get great results with this camera.  I actually think starting off with a nicer camera as a newbie is better because you won't be frustrated with lack of abilities and options.  ADORE IT!  Would not change it for the world!On that note, if you are going to be a serious photog and will be shooting in Fine jpegs or in Raw, PREPARE TO BUY MEMORY!!  I bought a 64g SDXC and Compact Flash and I don't have memory problems, although I have heard that these fail and its better to buy smaller memory cards in case they crash on you.  Anyways, you will want to buy the professional quality fast memory cards if you don't want to get frustrated with the regular cards going slow.  B/c this has SO MANY pixels, you are going to go thru your memory fast, so be prepared (reference:  One 4g memory card only held 17 raw photos.  Consider yourself warned).  For those of you who don't care about that many pixels, I'd go with the D700 or the D4 instead.  As for me, I love the flexibility of this many pixels.

Although there are many negative reviews about quality control on this camera (left sensor problems in early releases), color flaws (green shift), and handling (radical redesign of body), I have either not experienced any of these issues or not been bothered by them.But buyers should be aware, this camera is not made for everyone's computer set up. First of all, the D800 makes MONSTER sized RAW files at full-frame.  There are three image size settings which help in this respect, but if you're getting this camera for full-frame advantages, then this might be an issue.  Make sure you have plenty of HD space if you're planning to work right away with the D800.For Lightroom 3.0 users and Mac OSX 10.5 users, this camera will also present a number of serious challenges.  Lightroom 3.0 doesn't recognize the D800 .NEF format.  If you want to upgrade to Lightroom 4, which does recognize the format, you will need to have Mac OSX 10.6 or better.  For 10.5 users, this is an upgrade that is unavailable or messy at best.  So you may need a new computer to run Lightroom with the D800.If you do manage to upgrade your Mac from 10.5, then you better hope you are not using Photoshop CS3 because that will then be unusable, requiring an upgrade on that program to CS4 or better.  Quite an expensive proposition.BTW -- Adobe's raw plug-in on Photoshop CS3 also doesn't recognize the D800 .NEF file; the free Adobe RAW Converter (downloadable on the Adobe website) might, but program doesn't seem to work on OSX 10.5 systems.UPDATE May 26, 2013:  Eventually had to update to Snow Leopard due to workflow concerns.  So how does CS3 function in my experience?It's as bad as was rumored.Multiple crashes on CS3 Photoshop.  \"Place\" command unusable.  Also, some crashes on CS3 Illustrator and CS3 Dreamweaver.

If you take time to set up the exposure with this camera and post process you'd get nice results. Otherwise, most point and shoot would give similar results.  The highlights are controlled so that there is less tendency to bloom even if they're overexposed.  Details in the shadows can be pulled out without triggering false color appearance, up to a certain extent of course.Now here are the problems and they have been known:1) The left and right AF point is off, really off.  The left is worse than the right.  I didn't have to zoom in on the siemens circle to tell.  It stares at me in the face.  \"Real life\" pictures using those focus points are unfocused.  The center focus is accurate enough. Why does this bother me?  Because there are some cameras without this problem and because I take many pictures with my subjects off-centered.This a well known problem and it has been posted all over the web.  So why does Nikon continue to push out these defective ones?!  It would have taken them literally seconds to test and find whether or not there are AF problems.  The conclusion that I can come up with is that Nikon is using people to \"beta test\".  Yet, there are plenty of people who still want to buy this camera. I think they are like me, in that they hope they're one of the lucky ones who would not encounter this.  Also, there are people are willing to send the camera to Nikon repair to fix the problem, which I don't recommend.  There are horror stories of cameras being worse off and even damaged upon return.  And some folks don't mind the defect because they don't use those focus points.But stop and think for a second.  You've spent $3000 as the other guy with the same camera.  His is fine and yours is defective.  Is that really OK with you?2) The LCD is yellow-greenish, not too much on mine.  I can live with it as I do all my WB later. But this IS a problem.  My 5DIII does not have this issue.3) Auto metering is off by 1.5 stop.  There are ways to get around this, but out the box, auto metering is off.4) Auto WB under incandescent and halogen is gawd awful, off by about 3000K.  Granted these lighting situations are difficult for many cameras, but come on... get it just a little right.Even though the sensor is good, I'm still giving this camera one star.

I'm not a pro photographer but consider myself an advanced amateur. From my perspective as a long-time Nikon D100 user, the three greatest step-up features for me sre the full-frame 24x36mm sensor, the high pixel count and the full-HD video capability.The full-frame sensor (vs my previous APS-C-sized one) will now yield a decent wide-angle field of coverage from my 24-85mm Nikon lens. The high pixel count (vs my previous 6 MP) will allow larger, sharper prints but will also allow greater flexibility in cropping, while retaining sharpness. The video capability is a bonus for me as I don't shoot much video. I do have two HDTVs and a computer and software that can edit HD videos and burn to blu-ray disks.

I've been shooting with the D700 for years so I was ecstatic when the D800 was released.  I ordered my D800 in April 2012 and just received it in August 2012.  Right after receiving it I had a wedding and was excited to see how it would perform.  Throughout the day I didn't seem to have any problems and was feeling pretty good about how the wedding images were going to turn out.  After reviewing the images, I was horrified to find that most the images were out of focus.  Not just the low light or action pictures, even most of the pictures with the bride and groom stationary outside in great light.YES, the camera and lenses were set to AF and not manual.  I had the camera set to the low volume beep to indicate it was focused and it was beeping the whole time so I know it was trying to work.  Throughout the day I was switching lenses between one of my D700 bodies and my new D800.  The D700 had zero problems with focus using the same lenses. Thanks God I had my D700 shooting throughout the day or I'd be totally screwed.  The D800 didn't achieve 1 focused picture of the bride walking down the aisle and didn't get a clear image of the kiss, and very few clear images during the ceremony.  My D700 saved the day where the D800 failed.I don't know if it was a defective body or if this is a common problem with the D800 but I'm attempting to return it right now.  If this is a widespread problem, hopefully Nikon fixes it quick or I'm jumping ship to Canon.  I'm not about to wait another 5 years for a new body.P.S. All the images do have the green tint problem, my D700 has a perfect balance between magenta and green.  The D800 often produces images that give a subject's skin a dull orange tone where my D700 gives a perfect warm glow.  I shoot 100% manual exposure and manual white balance so I'm definitely able to compare the 2 cameras apples to apples.I think a $3,000 camera should be able to focus on a subject, so my 1 star rating is perfectly justified.

Sure enough, it shipped the first day they had it in stock and now I have it!I would class myself as an advanced amateur. I've switched back and forth several times between Canon and Nikon but since the D7000 came out I've been pure Nikon. With this camera I am feeling really good about my decision. For me, this is the ultimate camera. Useful for landscapes, weddings and macro but also good enough for my kids' soccer matches using a DX lens.I've only just unboxed the camera so don't have a whole bunch of observations but I will share what I see so far. My first picture was numbered 53, which I found odd. I reset the counter. I tried \"quiet\" mode, but I don't find it so quiet. With a mirror that large, it will be hard to make it truly quiet. Really all it seems to do is delay the return (flip down) of the mirror until you let off the shutter. No big deal. Focus is very quick. The feel of the camera is very solid and the shutter sound is nice, with authority, although not as sharp a sound as I remember from the D700 (which I tried briefly). Compared to the D7000 that I've been shooting for well over a year now, it looks classier. Specifically I like the fact that it does not have any shiny stuff on it. The rubber (or whatever it is) has a great feel to it.I tried the AF-S Micro 105mm, the AF-S Micro 60mm and the AF-S 50mm 1.4. All performed beautifully. As an aside, I did not like the fact that the 105, despite being a pro lens, is now made in China. Yeah, I know the quality is probably identical to the Japanese made version but it just rubbed me the wrong way. I found a nice used one on eBay that was made in Japan. Saved money too! It was bought in anticipation of the D800, so today is the first I've shot it. Nice lens, looks very sharp and focuses very quickly.Back to tested lenses, I then tested a 20mm 2.8 AI-s (non auto focus) lens that I also bought specifically for the D800 because it is supposed to be very sharp. And I figure I don't need auto focus for landscapes. By the way, the lens was bought brand new (it is still made). Great feel. Anyway, to make it work correctly I had to set the non-CPU lens data so that the camera would know the focal length of the lens and understand the f-stops. I assumed that I would have to set the lens at f22 and then use the command dial to set aperture but actually you set it on the lens itself and the camera recognizes the setting (but only after you set the non-CPU lens data). Prior to setting the data, the camera calls f2.8 f0, f4 it calls f1, f5.6 it calls f2, etc. After setting the lens data, the f-stops are registered and recorded correctly.Finally, I tried a DX lens, the AF-S 18-200 II that I used mostly on the D7000. I plan to continue to use this lens for sports and the like because of the 1.5x magnification and the faster shutter compared to using real FX lenses. When you look through the viewfinder, around the outside of the view you see a black circle since a DX lens cannot completely cover the FX sensor. You also see a black rectangle corresponding to the area that will actually be captured. It's nice. Also, this happens automatically since the camera recognizes that you have a DX lens mounted. I believe you can purposefully set an FX lens to DX mode too, discarding the outside part of the frame, but I did not try this. One advantage to using a DX lens (or an FX in DX mode) is that you can get a faster maximum frames per second. I did not test how many frames per second I got (I presume it was 5 as the specs state) but I did test how many frames I could take before the buffer filled up and the frame rate dropped. I was shooting NEF only. The camera took about 20 frames at full speed before slowing. The card in use was a Lexar Pro SDXC Class 10 (133x) 64GB card.One other thing that my D7000 didn't do but the D800 does is allow easy access to change the Auto ISO settings. Now, you hold the ISO button and spin the rear command dial to change the target ISO (basically the minimum ISO in Auto mode) and what's new (to me at least) is that you can spin the front command dial to turn Auto ISO on and off. On the D7000, as far as I know you had to delve into a menu to do that.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "lampcola", "ReviewID": "R2VF96RJO3Y9UZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Performance of the Camera is Outstanding.

I have been on the \"fence\" on FX since the D700 was released and as of late, have been waiting for the rumored D600 - mainly for less MP and price (more on this later...).This review is for those who maybe on the \"fence\" as I was.  Bottom line: YES, go for the FX and continue using what lenses you already have!Here's some reasons why (I'll update as I come across more things or as comments/requests are posted...):1.  The D800 allows you to select what \"crop factor\" you want.  I have been using the Nikkor 17-55/2.8 lens for six years as my \"everyday\" lens.  My first shots with the D800 was with this lens.  The camera's (default) setting is auto select DX crop when a DX lens is on the mount.  In the view finder, the view remains 100% FULL FRAME, but you see a black DX boarder inside the full frame.  As the camera focus locks, the boarder will flash red (as well as the focus point).  And likewise, if 5:4 crop mode is selected, a 5:4 boarder is displayed in the viewfinder.  Ok, so what does this mean?  NEF (RAW), jpeg, and tiff files reflect 15.4MP DX file size.  For example, D800's FX NEF (lossless compressed) is around 40MB.  DX NEFs (also lossless compressed) are about 20MB.  [I was not able to find this information anywhere...]  In comparison, the D200's (10MP) NEFs (lossy compressed) is around 9MB.  I really didn't want to be working with the size of 36MP NEF files if I continue to use DX lenses!  I am not a \"pixel peeper\" and was reluctant for the large MP sensor.  In contrast, the D600 is rumored to have 24MP - one that makes my storage hard drives a little \"happier.\"2.  DX lenses CAN be used as FULL FRAME lenses.  However, they may not be as sharp and may have other distortion properties.  Using the 17-55/2.8 at 17-28mm range (in FX mode), the corners of the frame are lost.  However, the center/focus point remains sharp.  Also as mentioned earlier, the FX mode lossless compressed NEFs are 40MB.  I'll continue to test if 30-55mm range remains sharp in the FX mode through all apertures.  If the results are good, then it seems I have a true 30-55mm/2.8 from the 17-55 lens, and I also have 45-80mm/2.8 (DX crop) too!  (I will now be looking for the 14-24/2.8 :-).)3.  Pics are SHARP!  I am very pleased with how well the camera handles noise at 3200-6400 ISO!  Have I mentioned the pics are sharp?  True, at wide apertures the pics are not as sharp as the D800e model, they are still sharper than the D200 at ISOs greater than 200!4.  D800 is feels much lighter than the D200!  I have to readjust my balance points with this new camera.  The 17-55/2.8 on the D200 felt balanced.  It now feels much heavier than the body.  It is something I will have to get used to - since I've been so comfortable with the D200.Other info:Switching from video to camera mode is a little awkward.  The shutter, aperture, and ISO settings are NOT retained from the camera mode when switched to video.  They are completely independent.I'll continue to test with other lenses - 70-200/2.8 (also with the TC 2x), 50/1.4, and 24-70/2.8.-- update July 10, 2012 --These lenses were tested:17-55/2.8 (DX): In FX mode shows significant vignetting 17-30mm, PS and Aperture cannot really fix it.  However, from 30-55 Aperture 3.x does pretty good adjusting for vignetting.  In DX mode, no significant issues with apertures 2.8 through 11 (a tiny bit of vignetting just in the far corners barely noticeable).50/1.4:  In auto mode, the d800 detected this as a DX glass...  shot crisp pics (focus pt center focus) at 1.4.  In FX mode slight vignetting almost undetectable in the corners that are easily fixed using Aperture or other software.  Until I can afford the 85/1.4, this glass will remain my \"portrait\" lens.70-200 VR: DX just as good as on the D200.  FX mode does NOT disappoint!  A super piece of glass!TC-II 2.0x:  DX mode better than the D200!  With the D200 (600mm/5.6 equivalent) I notice some purplish fringe in some areas (especially flash reflection in eyes).  This did not happen with the D800 even with the \"pop-up\" flash!  I do not use the built in flash other than in CMDR mode but used it just for testing.  No issues - provides so much flexibility.  SO SHARP.I've tested AF-C and S with these lenses with no significant issues.  3D and Auto tracking works awesome!  Tracks kids, pets, and wildlife with ease!  However, it is a battery drain!--------------IMHO, the D800 will NOT completely replace my D200 for outdoor sports (6 fps with my battery grip), and shooting in direct sunlight.  Many reports online stating CCD sensors are still better than CMOS in extremely bright conditions.-- update July 10, 2012 --Direct sunlight:  The D800 has Active D-Lighting and HDR (not avail with RAW/NEF of course).  In near direct sunlight, these features are really works great!  However, since I shoot mainly RAW, I will continue using bracketing and doing post processing on a computer.--------------Hope this helps someone!", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW!

I got the D800, not the D800e, primarily because it was available and the D800e was not. However, without a tripod it is hard to imagine a shot where the lack of the anti-aliasing filter on the D800e could produce a higher resolution picture. The quality is so high, and the resolution so good on the D800 that I think you'll get camera shake and off-focus issues before the anti-aliasing filter would start blurring anything.The user interface is very good. Coming from the D200 (which I loved) via the D300 (which I did not) it's a homely feel and all the buttons are where I want them to be. LiveView on this one is simple to use, unlike on the D300. The one thing I really like is that the focus point selector is far enough to the right to be out of your way while holding the camera. On the D200 I had to lock it to avoid moving the focus point with my nose. That doesn't seem to happen with the D800.I have not noticed any green casts, nor any left focusing issues on mine. It came running the latest firmware, so it may have been fixed already.I've played with HDR on it, and it is perhaps the greatest initial disappointment. First, it won't work with RAW format. I'd have expected it to simply save the output as JPG, but it won't even turn on if set the camera to shoot RAW. Second, the few shots I took were all underexposed. I have to play with this a bit more and perhaps learn it, but after a few tries I went back to the old bracketing+photomatix solution. Active D-Lighting may be the solution if the contrast is not too great. It appears to post-process the shot to lighten the darker areas a stop or so. Lightroom will do the same in a heartbeat though.A minor nitpick is the high price of the USB 3.0 Cable. It comes with one, of course, and it is fast, but branded replacements are expensive. Fortunately, it is backward compatible with a USB 2.0 Micro-B cable so if you have your a standard Kindle cable you can still transfer pictures.

You can see the improvement in my shooting by visiting flickr.com/photos/210rgturbo .  There are 700 plus shots taken over four years.  I began with a $225 point and shoot Sony.  I moved to a fun but ultimately unsatisfactory Lumix super zoom.  I then moved to a Nikon D5100 but exchanged it in favor of the D7000.  The difference in build was very obvious although the D7000 must NEVER get even slightly wet around the control buttons.  Later I borrowed a Canon 5D Mk II for a month and realized that I needed a camera whose ISO capabilities exceeded either the D7000 or the 5D.After a great deal of research and watching the original problems with the focus of the D800 being resolved between 2/12 and 7/12 I bought my D800 in 8/12, I decided it was what I needed for the low light shooting that I love to do.Like the good soldier it is, the D800 has proven to take astonishing pictures right up to ISO 6400, (when there's reasonable light).  At night/low light I try and stay between 1600 to 2000 if nothing else is working.  Otherwise a very sturdy tripod is required as the shutter used by the D800, especially in viewfinder mode, snaps with ballistics that will blur not only hand held pics, but some tripod mounted pics as well.  The user manual states, in smallish print, that the D800 \"needs to be used in Mirror Up mode when the viewfinder is the means of focus\".  In very low light there is not enough contrast for Live View mode whose shutter action is entirely different from the viewfinder.  If you don't wish to shoot manually in mirror up you can choose to use the \"Exposure Delay Mode\" that lifts the mirror for one, two, or three seconds before then dropping the shutter again.  This is very handy if you are not able to use a remote shutter trigger.  Why the D7000 has almost no feedback in viewfinder mode seems strange.  I wonder if the D4 has this kind of sharp \"snap\" to its view finder setting.  The trouble with the \"Exposure Delay..\" is the loss of ability to use the multi shot modes.  If you're going to take several shots a second, its best be sure you're at least at 1/500th of a second.  I prefer 1/640th as the lowest speed for repeated shots.  This tends to completely cancel out the \"bounce\" from the shutter when using the viewfinder.As a resident of New York City I like to go into Central Park or to the Hudson or East Rivers around dawn and take pictures of the birds and other wildlife that is found in those places.  What one sees throughout the year is amazing.  But the need to shoot as high speeds in this low light is essential.  When things work, the shots can be hard to believe considering how long it takes to process the large RAW files.  Becoming familiar with the camera to the point that I now know it inside out though it seems there's always something to learn has paid off.Four pro lenses have now replaced the lesser FX and reasonable DX lenses that I already owned.  The moment I took my first shots with a the 80-200 ED (non VR) the difference was not only obvious but remarkable. My photography has improved in proportion to each new pro lens that I purchased. The other three are older.  The 28-70mm F2.8 ED, the 50mm F:1.8, FX/DX with aperture ring; not as good as the 1.4 but one fourth the price. Lastly an early 70s 300mm Nikkor-H Auto F4.5.  The second best part - detail being the first, was the price of $25.  If I take a bad photo with one of these four lenses I'm certainly at fault.  The trouble I had with the cheaper lenses was a tendency to back focus when I was using faster F stops.Common problem: the 10 pin lower connection on the camera's right side (looking at the front) that is covered by an attached piece of rubber Mine worked GREAT for a radio controlled remote.  I could get 300 feet away and take pics with the remote in my pocket!  Great for animals who get used to the camera just sitting there.  After about 4 months the plug INSIDE the camera came loose and cannot be accessed without opening the entire case and reattaching it. Really?  For $3,000?  I was told by the NYC authorized Nikon repair people that this is a COMMON PROBLEM.  One can use a flash shoe mounted remote, but it TOO must connect to the 10 pin connector.  I've been stuck without any kind of remote - a stupid act by Nikon who has so many kinds of ports on the D800 that they could easily have used something else as well in case the 10 pin went bad. You're going to want some sort of remote with the D800....My original and continuing complaint about THIS D800 is a hairline fracture that goes all the way around the Live View screen other sections of the rear camera.  Not seeing this for several weeks, I only noticed when I nearly pulled the back completely free from the main body!  I pushed it back into place then sealed the camera's cracks with very strong gaffer's tape.  I use that tape to hold on an otherwise excellent glass cover for the 3.2\" LCD screen as well.  It is used to seal other areas of the camera where non-attached covers fell off like the battery door which is a REAL annoyance.  I was handed the camera out of the box at Adorama's NYC store.  At the time they had a ludicrous seven day return policy.  Thinking Nikon would replace the camera, instead I was told it was caused by impact damage, and since I'd not returned it after the seven days to the store, it was now, according to the unhelpful Nikon folks, my fault; I'd be adding a very high price to the $3,200 I'd just spent to repair a three week old camera that I'd babied so carefully I was amazed at what I was hearing.  I was livid.  Fortunately, I purchased a warrantee that covered every kind of damage and its good for three years.  Wanting to see just how long I could go before it gave up, this camera will go this month (9/13)to be fixed free.I know this is long, but maybe if you're new to such a precision instrument it might be of some help.  I'm changing the rating to 4 (though it should be 4.5).Upgrade the firmware as soon as you get yours.  The upgrade is on the Nikon site.  The 1.0 and 1.1 versions need help though the upgrade doesn't address everything.MEMORIZE THE MANUAL that pertains to what you do. So many people on the street will see the D800 and tell me how great it must be to have such a \"rugged\", \"weatherproof\", \"well built\" camera.  None of that is true.  Its build quality is average.  Is the sensor truly that much more than the D700 which seemed much sturdier.I quote the manual:  \"This product is NOT waterproof.  Immersion in water\".... (getting it wet)..or exposure to high humidity may cause internal corrosion that cannot be repaired.\"  Most moisture related problems show up months later.Translation, get caught in a down pour and you'll be paying to fix all those internal parts that get just slightly wet.  The cost is terrible.  So much for the review I read about taking this camera duck hunting on a drizzly, cold morning.  The camera will kick the bucket before the ducks do!  I use my camera with EXTREME care these days.So summing up, use only the very best lenses, and experiment like crazy with ISO too. The latest version of Lightroom 5 does very well at settling down noise.  I haven't sent mine to be fixed because I love the pictures so much. This is the first of its kind, so its bound to be a mixed affair, regardless of who makes it.  Try not to spend $2,999.  It can be had for at least $200 less from some places, just be sure you have plenty of time to examine and return it if necessary.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best in its class", "Author": "CMC", "ReviewID": "R1U4Y4X4VYEDD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Took for ever For Nikon to Deliver this long awaited camera, it does evrything it claims it does, the only negative side is that the lcd screen does have a greenish look that can be somewhat fixed, its the best Fx in its class.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quite an improvement over my D7000", "Author": "John Danley", "ReviewID": "RDVFPL878WLZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the large sensor and high ISO capability of this camera.

Let's really explore this focusing issue. I spent about a week obsessively exploring the inner focusing of my D800 and reading a lot about this issue.

I've been using the same model and setup for the past year, damn the result is terrible, she looked like the HULK.Nikon, shame on you, you have cost me lots of money to ship the unit to Qatar and now i have to pay shipping and taxes again for new unit, how bad can this be.The technician from Salam group showed me 8 returned used peaces for the same issue, and he said your chances to get a good one is 30%All Nikon Customers, please take your cameras to official testing store and get your camera tested, and send it back to Nikon if it has the issue, they need to stop selling Factory Defected Items and some one should sue them for this.One thing I will have to say that Amazon Customer Support are the best in the world, I was so frustrated from what happen the agent was very cooperative and I felt some how that I'm secured for dealing with such firm, I will always going to consider Amazon in my next purchases and never Nikon again.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best DSLR made for Many Shooters", "Author": "Capt RB", "ReviewID": "RG69Z3BDZ17CU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've tested the D800 against the 5DIII and there is no question that Nikon has built a ground-breaking camera.

I know two pros who had shoots planned and simply bought the 5DIII because they could get it. The greatest DSLR isn't much good if you can't buy one. IF YOU CAN WAIT it is worth waiting for.The D800 has class leading resolution, high ISO ability and the best low ISO dynamic range ever. The resolution is quite close to a medium format camera. Focus is improved even beyond the D3s. The only downside is the insanely priced vertical grip. 3rd party will make a fortune building a grip that is even better for less money.After many weeks and more time with both cameras:1) The Canon 5DIII is the better cam for JPEG shooting, but by a small margin.2) The Nikon D800 is better at RAW and by a larger margin.Both are great cams and you can't go wrong, but Nikon's D800 is the DSLR to beat this year.

It seemed like this D800 hit the market a full year to 18 months later then we had hoped for, after all my D700 has been in my bag nearly 4 years with no refreshes made,( unlike the D3 & D300 had) when my D800 was finally received, (that's 28 in dog years, or too long in Nikonian years.) After such a long wait I assumed Nikon would have all the bugs worked out by their delivery date, after all the biggest Nikon \"Pro-Testers\" have been providing feedback to Japan since early 2011, so how in the Heck could so many D800 bodies be shipped with this startling LCD Display?Have you seen a D800 yet with the nasty Yellowish-Green Tinted LCD? Well,I have and it's very sad, Unacceptable, but still very sad. I wanted to work through this isuue, so I tweaked the picture styles all the way to magenta and it helped, I also turned off Auto LCD Brightness and set custom white balances to take the Nikon standard previews out of the equation,.......These helped, but did not solve the very undesirable tint cast over each frame.Apparently not all D800s have arrived to customers with this manufacturers flaw, but after reading about the many hundreds that are having this same problem, I decided to return the D800 to Amazon.Amazon is the best on the rare occasion an item of this level must be returned, still, I wished I didn't have to, but this is an expensive tool and it needs to be correct from the start.Nikon has not admitted (as of June 15th 2012) that anything is wrong with any D800 displays, they say it's more correct then my D700 and D3s..........Ahhh, WRONG!!

Who really needs a larger image than that?2. The weather-sealed, magnesium alloy body will last for years.3. The shutter is tested out to 200K releases. That ought to hold me for a while.4. The camera supports the fastest CF and SD memory cards, along with USB 3.0 for high-speed data transfer.5. Clean, uncompressed 1080p broadcast-quality video, with lots of video accessories. This camera really controls the rolling shutter effect better than any I have used previously.6. It's a Nikon, which places it in a \"system\" of cameras and lenses that range from consumer to pro level. There are plenty of accessories, lenses, attachments, and software to support my camera.7. The massive resolution in this sensor makes this camera a medium-format level camera. Affordable medium format is back.

Bigger screen is a plus and live view is really impressive. Settings are reachable once you get used to it. When compared to much more expensive Nikons like D3X and D4, they both have the same processor and sensor so the difference that makes those cameras more expensive is added durability, battery grip, faster shot per second and lower image sizes.

Nokia's camera phone has 41MP, does any of you seriously want that?D800 is an improvement over D700 in these areas: AF in low light (locks slightly better), noise level at ISO above 6400 (this is arguably useful shooting in pitch darkness), better auto ISO by linking shutter speed, focal length and iso, lighter (very perceptible, 100g is a lot), Video (this is clearly missing from D700).However, for me the overall ability to crank out images at default settings hand held has actually gone down. The images lack a certain pop and sharpness. When using a tripod or flash (i.e. shutter speed is high), the images are sharper looking. However, the whole point of having a camera of this class is that you don't have to do that. It seems the Sony sensors Nikon uses (in D800 and D7000) suffer from a curious deficit in detail retention. The amount of MP is not translating into more details and quality.

NO GREEN TINT!!!This camera does what's it's designed to.  For most people with focusing issues - Are you guys trying out different lenses and tested it on a tripod???  What aperture were you using???  Was there sufficient light on the subject???  There are a lot of variations.  It seems that this focus issue has been blown out of proportion all over the net.  Not saying that your camera is not faulty but it just seems that more than half of the negative reviews are done by mainly amateurs after watching a few videos online with negative reviews about the camera and they automatically think that their camera would be faulty.  I know that many people will turn around and bash this review which is fine as everyone has their own opinions but all I am saying is conduct a few scientific tests by trying out different lenses under different circumstances such as lighting, location, subject etc and then draw the conclusion.When I received my D800 I was speculating too that it would have the left focus issue.  I attached my 50mm 1.4 lens to it and first time around I moved the focus selector all the way to the left and took my first shot - BLURRY.  Very ticked off!  Tried the very right focus - SHARP!  Now I was getting a hold of the camera.  While handholding I moved the focus selector back to the left and took another shot - reasonably sharp but not tack sharp.  When I took the shot on the left I missed out the fact that the light was dim in that sector of the frame then again when I moved my focus selector back to the right on a different subject it was sharp - now all this was handheld.  To my surprise the light source on the right was better because there was a table lamp close by while the left was dark so that would cause some focusing issue plus the camera was handheld thus many factors involved here.Next, I put my d800 on a tripod and shifted the selectors all to manual mode shot a subject with very far right and very far left focus selections w/ exposure lock - both the same result - SHARP after pixel peeping.  Now this is NOT a scientific way of testing this camera but for me this is good enough as I took several more shots with only the left focus selected for a few days and no problems with blurring - This does not mean that I have a good d800 but for what I'll be using it's good enough - It also takes a bit to get used to the high mega pixels.So to all the people with the negative reviews about the camera please first check your settings, and try it out fully before claiming that you have a faulty unit!!!I may have gotten lucky with my d800 or I never noticed it but the bottom line is I am satisfied and I like my camera and not to be taken back by negative reviews all over the web AND if you have a lemon then I would suggest to return it and wait till the end of the year for a replacement and hopefully Nikon would fix the issue or atleast admit it that there is a problem!!!", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Updated... got a good camera on 11/7/12", "Author": "JonathanB \"Jonathan & Chele\"", "ReviewID": "R3MU1VSIBHBCM3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was just saying this over at nikonrumors.com.... Just walk away from this camera for now.  If photography is your business (it's one of mine), then you have to treat this like a business decision.  There's a quality problem with this camera right now.  Why there's a problem is not important to me.Lots of people on different sites are commenting on the focusing issue, the green tint to the screen issue and the poor customer service from Nikon.  The D800 might turn out to be a great camera in the future, however it's pretty clear that the issues with this camera have not been resolved yet.  If I end up buying one, it will be months after everyone finishes talking about how the issues have been fixed.When I'm shooting, I don't need to be shooting around a camera issue.  Everything breaks sooner than later, however reading comments about focus issues right out of the box, paying $75 or more to ship your new camera around the world to have it fixed and hoping that it does indeed come back fixed is not something I knowingly walk into.  Then there's the obvious waste of business capital tied up in a brand new camera that may not be ready for production use for months after I spend the money... Perhaps large studios can absorb that cost... my studio cannot.So I'm confident that all the postive reviews are correct and I'm very happy for those photographers.  For me, I'll have to wait until most of the major issues are worked out before I can consider a purchase.UPDATE 10/16/12:  If you're going to try the D800, buying it after Nov 1, 2012 will increase your return window from 30 days to 3 months as Amazon extends your return window for the Holiday season.  So if you need a D800 now, waiting until 11/1/12 will significantly increase your window to evaluate/test the camera and return it if it's defective.  I may just try it...UPDATE 11/8/12:  Since Amazon provides a 3 month return window, I purchased the D800.  Received shipment on 11/7/12 (serial 3047###).

It would be an excellent studio camera, and is a good all-around full frame walkabout camera, that is lighter than the pro bodies, although not quite so fast.  Excellent sensor.However, Thom Hogan, who writes extensively about Nikon, calls many actions by Nikon USA customer hostile.  They have refused to sell parts to uncredited repair shops, and even to customers.  They are uncommunicative about flaws in the cameras.My personal beef is their repair policies.  If you want details, check out Thom Hogan, Roger Cicala of lenrentals and the FX forum on dpreview.I dropped my camera a short distance in August.  This caused cosmetic damage to part of the top lcd display.  Since the camera still functioned, and I knew how nasty Nikon repair is, I didn't send it in.  Then, several months later, for unrelated reasons, it got an error message and stopped working.  They held it for over seven weeks.  There is also no effective way to communicate with them while the camera is under their control.  This is not acceptable.So go ahead and buy this, if you want it.

You don't really need 36 megapixels. But when the coyote is 300 yards away and the light is shining the incredible late-afternoon golden glow and you don't have your 12 pound telephoto on the camera and you have a fantastic shot that fills 1/4 of the frame, you actually do have a fantastic shot. You didn't lose it trying to get the right lens on the camera in time, or ending up with fuzzy interpolation from blowing up a crop too much. 16 megapixels will give you a wonderfully sharp 8x10, and most people would have no problem with larger blowups to even 16x24 with some careful processing. The full resolution of the D800 is overkill for all except the most critical applications.With a DX lens, this will give you roughly the same resolution as a D7000. You can take great photos without worrying about filling the frame with an FX lens, assuming good optics, shooting technique, conditions, etc. You can use a 400mm lens and get 600mm or even 800mm equivalent photos to a more normal resolution camera.None of this would be true if it weren't for the phenomenal performance of the D800 sensor. I was very skeptical of the performance of such tiny pixels, but WOW! It's fantastic even in low light conditions.And when you do want to do that carefully controlled full-frame photograph with every detail captured and blow it up to poster size, well, the detail truly can be amazing.It's not a speed demon. It isn't a match for fast sports photography or horse-jumping where you want to get a burst of really fast frames to get just the right image. But it's good for pretty much everything else.It doesn't have \"scene\" setting or other casual-photographer-friendly features. But setting up the menus is not difficult. Programming the 4 banks gives you the ability to set your own \"scene\" modes, and do it in a way that fits your particular style. I do wish I could lock the settings banks, since if I make a change it's permanent and often I would prefer to have the change only for that particular shoot.There are lots of detailed reviews out there. Read them to make your decision about this camera. The sensor is right at the physical edge of the optics for SLRs. More than F8 with most lenses and your resolution will be limited by the physical laws of light diffraction, even with perfect glass. Camera shake, subject movement, all will have an impact now. But having said all that, I find that I can take wonderfully sharp, detailed photographs beyond anything I have done before, and with judicious cropping, I have gotten great photos where I could not have previously.I paired this with the extra-battery grip.

But because of this, I own a 5d instead and there are no issues at all with it.There is one huge difference that separates Nikon from Canon when it comes to fixing problems that occur when they get screened by the public.  Canon acknowledges the issue and then fixes it.  They don't wait to update that model for next year or the next few years.  Nikon does not do this. If there's a problem with your camera they will not even acknowledge there's problems that need to be addressed and they will not fix it in their product line until an updated camera comes out to replace the one with the issues.Canon had a flawed Light Leak issue that went on dpreview when people started to report metering changes from the back of the camera. Canon acknowledged this and fixed it right away.  All subsequent models were updated so this was NOT an issue for later models after it was fixed and it was also ingrained in the serial which ones were fixed and which ones might still be affected.Nikon has known about the oil spots / dust on the sensor for a long time since it went viral on a youtube video and when dpreview reported it to millions of people who viewed the site. That was back more than 9 months ago.  But it's not just the d600 it's with a good number of Nikon's products.  The d800 has a bad left focus point. It's white balance is off and it casts a green screen tint that is not up to viewing spec when you want to accurately gauge what the picture might turn out. In the production world this is called monitoring and without a monitor, you have no clue what the output will become when you capture it. Sadly it's not even these two cameras. The d5100 (a recent camera came out 2011) had malfunctions where the image would go entirely black even though the camera was still taking photos, this was a malfunction and there was no fix for this issued by nikon. Users of that camera just had to wait for it to be updated with the d5200.  Nikon did not care about the customers who bought the d5100 and never fixed the issue. Not just cameras that suffer from these issues, but their flashes as well. it's been known that Nikon's $500+ SB-900 flash was overheating and needed a lengthy time to cool down. This was a big problem and a lot of users complained about it.  But Nikon doesn't fix it, they ignore it and wait for the release of the update where the problem gets addressed. And they don't lose money and probably make more money because everyone who was tired of the SB-900 overheating just went to buy the SB-910, so they probably doubled their profits because they got to sell 2 flashes to the same individual.Nikon just does not care about it's customers. Until they start treating their customers with respect you should not have faith that what you bought has been screened and assured that it will not have some type of issue or malfunction because Nikon is strict with its warranty even though it knows of flaws that come out of certain products.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like", "Author": "Melvin Edwards", "ReviewID": "R1943Y1SO5WAOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "man,  I'm going from a crop sensor to this full format.

What I could shot on a D300 easily in, say, F4, 125, and ISO200 simply will NOT work on this.  Your shots will be incredibly dark.  But, easy fix - pump up the ISO to 800, and you're back on track.  This is pretty much the only real shooting adjustment that I had to make - it's just a great camera that produces great images.

K. Wlin", "ReviewID": "R3SFZG1XUARYTR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I know doing a review here would trigger the Nikon fans. If I do this same review on the 5D Mark iii it would have been the opposite. You can see it on the feedbacks. I will try to be as objective as I can even after I got burned dumping the Nikon equipment and switched to Canon. This has been my weeks of research finding the right full frame DSLR. First I like to state that I was a Nikon D90 owner and has been extremely happy with it. The reason I started with Nikon as my first DSLR was because Nikon had lower noise on high ISO compared to Canon and I was not impressed with Canon's mega pixel hype. My research was targeted to 2 DSLR, Nikon D800 and Canon 5D Mark iii and I was determined to get the full frame with higher quality still image. I went through at least 90% of the video reviews online for the D800 and Mark iii, so this is going to save you many nights of research. I was a Nikon fan but I ended up with a Mark iii and since have not looked back after I've confirmed my findings, comparing my Mark iii with my friend's D800.1. More mega pixel, more noise. Nikon just shot themself on the foot getting into the mega pixel race which Canon used to play. The D800 has noticeable noise level than the Mark iii when compared at 12k or higher ISO. I shot photos of green leaves on an indoor plant when I did the side by side comparison.2. Auto white balance under fluorescent lighting shows a greenish tone on the D800 which looks very unnatural. Even after I played with it by adjusting the Kelvin, I could not make it better than the Mark iii image taken under the same condition with Auto white balance.3. Moire on video on the Mark iii is slightly better but only if you compare the 2 videos side by side.4. D800 shows more detail outdoor, or indoor with tons of light. I would buy the D800 if I need the mega pixel badly but it has no use for me other than chewing up my memory and slowing down the frame rate. The D800 has to wait for 2 minutes for the buffer to clear after shooting about 15 continuous frames. The Mark iii kept on going but at a much slower rate. At least the Mark iii was still usable while the Nikon was not responding at all.5. Focus on the Mark iii is faster than D800. The D800 does hesitate a bit whereas the Mark iii was push and click, yes it's scary fast.6. Canon video has more accurate white balance and this carries on to the Mark iii. If you do video, Mark iii is a no brainer. The video was also a lot sharper than my Canon M52 which incorporates the 1/3 inch sensor, the big camcorder uses. Again a no brainer if you are a cinematographer.7. Most people are using the camera for sports, family, wedding and not landscape and the Mark iii is better for those applications.8. Nikon however is coming out with the D600 that may improve ISO over the D800 since it is going to be much lower mega pixel. Update: D600 proves to have more ISO noise than D800.I have switched to Canon because of my need but it does not mean you have to. It all depends on your need. If you are a landscape photographer or wants to blow up your photo extremely large with more mega pixels and you have plenty of lights, stick with Nikon. If you are a cinematographer, sports, wedding or simply indoor photographer go with the Mark iii. Canon is not always going to be better than Nikon and Nikon isn't always going to be better than Canon. But I can honestly tell you, for now this year Canon has stepped up and broken the ISO barrier. It has caught up with Nikon's low noise technology after 2 complete product cycles. What took Canon so long, I have no idea. I am hoping Nikon will come up with something better next year but for now their strategy, isn't better technology instead they will be focusing on prices. It is working, look at the D800 back orders. Is Nikon going to lose the war to Canon, no so fast, watch for the D600 which is the next sign of full frame price war. Within 2-3 years, full frame cameras will be average pro-summer cameras, no longer pro. The Sony Nex 7 is another example, mirror-less, smaller body, big crop sensor, big lens, point and shoot. Pro is going for much bigger sensors than 35mm. Buy full frame lens, I predict the crop lens will eventually be something casual moms will be using and the price will drop significantly because they will be produced in much larger quantities.Update, I was wrong about Mark III not have any moire issue at all. The other day I was reviewing my video, I notice a bit of moire not as noticeable and much better than D800. So far all the cameras I researched have moire issue some better than others. I was paying attention to all the movies and noticed the cameras Hollywood uses all have some sort of moire issue. After the Cine Gear Expo, I noticed something which you should greatly take into consideration. Canon has a flag ship of video cameras including the 1DC and the C500 and Nikon had none. What that tells me is Nikon is very behind on the video part. How does this affect your decision to stay with Nikon when it is only still that you are concerned about? Video has become a very import integrated feature in the DSLR and sooner or later it will be important to you. Example is that you can sneak in a nice video of a family gathering in between stills. By staying with Nikon and continue to invest on the lens would lock youself into a company that is falling behind on technology. I said this on Kodak in 1993 when I purchased my first Olympus digital camera. The only way Nikon can fix this problem is to stay in the prosummer market with great prices. The D800 is another sign that Nikon is selling on price whereas Canon does not have to. If you are serious enough about photography and you are going to invest a lot of money in Nikon equipment in the long run think carefully and not get caught up on the Nikon/Canon rivalry which I can care less. I spoke highly of Nikon when I had the D90 which has better ISO than the T3i at the time time and the Canon fans were attacking me. But now the market has changed, Canon has uncovered Nikon's ISO secrete and the Mark III has better ISO than the D800. Canon is also the leader in the video technology that is becoming increasingly important on DSLR. Canon has about a 3 years lead on Nikon when it comes to video and Nikon will likely not catch up for decades. Bet on Google or Yahoo? It is pretty obvious now but it wasn't 15 years ago. Come back to my review 10 years later and it will be very interesting to see the outcome. Oh, I would not have switched to Canon if they never could crack Nikon's ISO secrete. It took Canon 2 product cycles to catch up but I think the video technology is much more complicated and takes decades to develope. My 2 cents, hopefully save your investment or not, we will see.The D800 is sharper under daylight condition due to more pixel count and better DR but with a few issues when the it gets darker or when it shoots video. Both focus really fast but the Canon has less hesitation during focus. The D800 ISO noise when compared to the Mark III is about 2 stops off, see Kai's comparison video, he is correct. This is mostly due to the higher pixel count and the fact that Canon has uncovered Nikon's secrete technology in lower ISO noise. The frame rate is slower than Mark iii, due to the processor has to process more data and the buffer suffers greatly as a result. Nikon should have put in a larger buffer memory chip, see the cowboy video, he is right that the D800 literally freezes after serveral continous frame shots. In addition the D800 has serious moire issue especially when shooting video. The Mark III does have some moire (There is a video claiming Mark III has no moire issue which is totally false, search Moire mark III D800 on youtube) it just has the least amount, among the DSLR but it is still there. WB is way off under indoor lighting on the D800. Even in Lightroom, I find it difficult to correct. Canon is got the WB down, no Lightroom needed for most shots. However the D800 does have higher pixel count which gives you a higher resolution image to work with for magazines.. etc. Make sure there is plenty of light, either shoot in day light or with adequate 5k lighting at night or you will be disappointed with the ISO noise or WB problem. If you are sports or wedding photographer or a casual walk-around shooter who often has to work with low nature light, the Mark III is a clear winner. If you are in landscape or shooting models under controlled lighting, the D800 is the winner. I have verified most of the trusted D800 vs Mark iii comparison videos on Youtube which basically have reached the same conclusion. The Nikon is excellent on crop sensor DSLR, the D7000 and the D90 beat the living crap out of the Canon T3i, T4i. This is a unbias review because I actually tested them side by side. Ownership creats bias opinion and you probably already own a D800 doing a review here. What you are shooting determines which camera to use. If you are not getting into full frame by all means go with Nikon, if you are into full frame and got the extra $500 and you are not landscape or model photographer go with Canon. Canon has made amazing advancement in full frame but clearly dropped way short when compared to Nikon on the cropped sensors DSLR. I know this for a fact, because I own the D90, D40, D7000, D5100, T3i and T4i. I have to reiterate that the Nikon crop bodies are way better than Canon. Why do we own so many cameras? Because, we have to choose the best one for our aerial quad and octocopter equipment. For semi pro aerial shots such as real estates, I would go with D7000 with a Hexa or quad which can lift a full frame. For pro shots such as Red Bull promotion, I would go with Mark III with an Octocopter. The D800 is a clear disappointment at least for me, plagued with WB, moire issues. Also the QA on Nikon has dropped significantly due to Nikon focusing on quantity delivery instead of quality. Canon is able to maitain the good quality status under this very competitive environment.Update: D600 turns out to have more ISO noise than the D800. I was under the impression that less mega pixel is going to improve on ISO. Nikon is really falling behind on the ISO technology which they used to be a leader. Nikon still clearly wins on crop sensor bodies but trails on full frame to Canon. This is a D800 review so the one star for the lost leader in full frame. If this is a D7000 or D90 crop bodies review Nikon would get a 5 stars and Canon would get 1.Updates 12/4/2012The Nikon truely shines with its built-in flash as it comes quite handy for fill-in flash. It also has better dynamic range than the Mark II. I am raising my stars to 4. This camera however can not be used as business for video due to heavy moire issue. The 5D Mark III is the only DSLR I found that has the least amount of moire.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "For tripod use ONLY!", "Author": "AlexZ \"Zapal & Zapel Prod.\"", "ReviewID": "R1MXD06UE366IT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I read hundreds of reviews and ordered the D800.
