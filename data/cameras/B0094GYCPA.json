It takes good picyires with a lot of options. The movie is great.Cons:But it eats the battery like there is no tomorrow.I change battery every day. If you take a movie, even more.The flash is super slow.Smtms it has hard time focusing.The SD card and battery slot is in the same spot, so batteries fall out everytime you open the SD card (unlike the older versions)In the end its OK, gets the job done. The full package batteries, tripod, bag etc.....are good", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great gift option", "Author": "Nana B.", "ReviewID": "R1BQTESLO5HGCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a nice starter camera for someone that wants to take pictures faster and have a better picture as the end result.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "happy", "Author": "Melissa Grenier", "ReviewID": "R3O3HEOWM1C1PG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love this new cam! would totally recommend this! takes great pictures, totally worth the price!

Picture quality is crisp and clear..has many picture settings which just makes it even more better..I got a broken tripod..( the tripod is flexible and small.. I liked that one..though)..and also I did not get the same camera case as it shows in the picture.. but the seller had apologized and I got a refund of $ 15 from them..Overall much interesting this is the camera and it works on AA batteries which makes it even more easy to go for outing and carry a bunch of batteries along with you.. and when they are down.. just replace with new ones!.. no headache of re-charging the battery ( you know the square or rectangular batteries which need plug points to re-charge... and when you are on and outing it will surely disappoint you to re-charge it).Enjoy clicking!..", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "My purchase", "Author": "Deane Atwood", "ReviewID": "R225TZNVDF71LY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this camera to take photos of my orchids in the greenhouse, it works fine for close ups.I love it and would recomend it to my friends.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth the money.", "Author": "Glenn", "ReviewID": "R2DXSZRHP3JSO2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works like a Nikon.
