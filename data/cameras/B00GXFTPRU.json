The Nikon D5300 has many incredible features.  I like being able to take pictures and be able to view them instantly on my IPAD.  I can even see the camera viewfinder, live on my IPAD, and take the picture remotely from the IPAD or my smart phone.  The lens (18-140) that comes with the kit is a bit bulky, but an overall great all around focal length for 90% of my photos.  The tripod is quite nice for a starter and the Nikon bag is very nice with plenty of room for the flash, extra lenses, etc.I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a very good starter kit for getting into high quality photography.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GXFTPRU"}}
