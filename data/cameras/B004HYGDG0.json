Fisher", "ReviewID": "R3DMCRVKLO0EFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on closeout at RadioShack because I needed it to upload pictures to my company's website and I didn't like letting my Nikon D60 sit on my desk while I wasn't there.I didn't expect a whole lot because of the price tag on this little camera, but boy was I surprised when I started snapping pictures. At the lower ISO settings, the clarity on this camera rivals my old Nikon Coolpix. The zoom on the lens is fantastic and the software, while a little awkward provides every function you need with just a few clicks.For a 14 megapixel camera, the file sizes are very conservative, with 2-4 Mb per shot on the highest settings. I haven't used the video function because I have no need for it, but I am really having trouble making this a \"work\" camera because I'm falling in love with it.Bottom line: If you know photography, this is a fantastic point-and-shoot for the price. You just can't beat it.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Casio camera", "Author": "Mrs. Teresa Huggins \"insurance wife\"", "ReviewID": "RZPVYEB4PZ4CD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice camera, pictures are great.  I've always liked this brand.  But this one is a little different than what we had before and feel stupid, but cannot figure out how to take upclose photos.  Need to figure this out, using it for our business..", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a Great Camera", "Author": "Gary Owen \"ElevenB Vet\"", "ReviewID": "RHDT4K5UOEKWO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "A decent price and great vendor but I bought it on the name Casio. Easy to use and in fact this would be my 3rd Casio.  And my last one.  Every new iteration seems to lose picture quality or has such a long shutter delay making it difficult to get the shot you want. The anti shake feature actually seems counter productive. I liked the very first EXLIM with the optical view finder the best.  The flash and overall shot quality has been greatly diminished from that version. I wish I still had it.  Who needs the capacity to store a zillion pictures anyway.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Ledif Alberto Morales del Castillo", "ReviewID": "R1OL3BPJSGCNN6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent, I am very happy with these purchases...!

Giordano \"bgior@comcast.net\"", "ReviewID": "RKAJXGPCAMAN7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was purchased as a replacement for a EXLIM EX-Z600 which had served me well until it dropped and the latch for the battery door got damaged. I expected this 12MP camera to provide photos a lot better than the 6MP ones from the Z600 but I don't see much difference. The movie button is a great improvement over the Z600 where I had to navigate a menu to change from still to movie. I received 3 other technology products for Christmas and as I spend time with it I may discover features and settings I am unaware of. If so I'll change my review.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera!!", "Author": "Andrea Richard", "ReviewID": "R3Q6CBLTYX856I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Takes great pics!! I love that it is easy to take a video but my favorite feature is being able to choose the Best Shot modes. The macro mode is ideal when I'm taking close ups of the children at work. The size is perfect too, I can hang it on my wrist or put it in my pocket! This is my third Casio Exilim!!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera is very good and easy to use", "Author": "Donuts", "ReviewID": "R2VL2KCM19TBJY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera.....I took some great pictures with it and the zoom is super and pictures aqre sharp...Recommend purchasing if you need a low priced camera that will fill the need.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent pocket camera...", "Author": "John C.

Hate scratches and dings. Has a good size LCD screen on the back.The camera took decent pictures for an entry level camera and I posted loads on facebook. Has a rechargeable battery which is great, plugs into computer USB port to charge. Easy to remove battery and memory card. Battery cover comes open all the time by accident, irritating but nothing falls out and a piece of tape would fix that. I only ever dropped the camera once, went on a hike and forgot to put the wrist strap on my wrist and you guessed it, dropped it flat on its back. It is now dead, the back of the camera picked up a couple of scratches but did not break, so I was disappointed to find the lens opening mechanism on the front will now not work. So I'm shopping for a new camera; new lens mechanisms complete from China are @25 on EBAY but for a less than $80 camera (after shopping around) the fix doesn't seem worth messing with. It's essentially a throw away camera. Battery life is good. Zoom distance is great for a beginner camera. Megapixel size is great for the price. For some reason mine would close before I was ready to finish taking pictures, I never could understand why, and if you have it on a certain setting it will drive you nuts because after pushing the button it will take a couple seconds to take the picture, never did figure that one out. Recommended for beginner, child, gift. I bought my wife a pink one, and picked the silver gift one for me!", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "so far so good", "Author": "clam digger", "ReviewID": "R1P0KKLGWZJHN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the camera and it is easy to use and download the pictures.  The sellers used the us post office so in my opinion it took longer than it should have to get here.  It was also shipped in an envelope.  It does not come with a memory card so bear in mind you will have to get one.  Another thing that I didn't like was that for some reason BLACK paint is more expensive than the others.....", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a decent camera for the price.", "Author": "Zach Brown", "ReviewID": "R22J5WYWTIQR3F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So the camera, for its pricing and size, is alright. If you're looking for a casual camera, this is an excellent buy.For the most part, this camera will be adequate for a variety of tasks, though I only found it taking pictures of acceptable quality when conditions were very favorable. The sun tends to flare out in the pictures I've taken, and close ups can be extremely grainy. Color replication is reasonably life like, but there is a slight distortion of greens. This camera is well suited for landscapes, photos requiring physical lens zoom (not digital zoom), and portraits.The camera itself is also well built, fairly rugged, and can withstand most day to day punishment with only moderate cosmetic damage. I recommend this as a beginning entry level camera.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "14.1 Megapixels\n5x Optical zoom with 26mm wide angle lens\n2.7 inch 230K LCD monitor\nFace detection\nEasy mode with 23 Best Shot Modes", "Name": "Casio Exilim EX-ZS5 Black 14 MP Stylish and Slim Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41X6wRdSYWL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004HYGDG0"}}
