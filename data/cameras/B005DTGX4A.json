I purchased this device because it is small, it recorded, takes pictures, and not too expensive. This device did the trick. With this device I was able to record the person who was destroying my home. When confronted he denied it of course, but with the evidence I had I was able to press charges. This device has a clear facial recognition feature. This device is what ultimately is what got the charges to stick.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Motion Detection - Battery Lasts for an Hour!  Good Toy", "Author": "Boston Geek", "ReviewID": "R291PI593A2ROA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This mini DVR has no motion detection and cannot be used as a security camera by itself as implied in the advertisement. The battery only lasts for about an hour. I bought this to record for at least 12 hours straight or much less with motion detection. For my use this is just a toy which I gave to my daughter.  It records videos for a maximum of 18 minutes on low resolution according to its internal RAM size.  Then it pauses a few seconds and records another 18 minute video until the micro SD card (bought separately-not provided) is filled.My 7 year old daughter loves it!  A cheaper video recorder broke after a week.  Let's see how this one fairs with all her recordings.Update from an hour after writing the above: The mini DVR broke.  Costs more and lasted less than the cheaper ones.  The color is off quite a lot and there is a little jiggling noise inside.  It seems like one of the photo sensors jarred loose inside.  We received this a few days ago.  Back it goes to Amazon.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$169.99", "Features": "All In One Mini Security DVR Camera, Records Movement And Protects Your Home\nSuperb CMOS Resolution; 5 Mega-Pixels; 4 Fixed-Focus Lens; 4x Digital Zoom;\nHD Video Resolution; 24 Or 30 FPS; 1.5 Inch TFT LCD Display Screen; Clear Face Detection\nPictures In Jpeg Format; Video In .AVI File Format; USB Port; SD Card Support Up To 16GB\nAudio Video Cable Included To Connect Direct To TV And View Stored Files", "Name": "GSI Quality Mini DVR With High-Definition 720p Photo And Video Camera - LCD Screen, Micro SD Memory Card Slot, USB Interface And A/V TV Output - For Security And Home Surveillance", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21rpq8pmwwL.jpg", "ProductID": "B005DTGX4A"}}
