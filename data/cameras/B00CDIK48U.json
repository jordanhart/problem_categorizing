{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Gets even better!", "Author": "anonymous \"anonymous\"", "ReviewID": "R2VX4XQTVSMDJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ever since the HX5V, the HX handheld series has seen improvement year after year. The HX50V is no exception. It now features 30X zoom, 400 battery shot life and retains the amazing video quality.I am a gadget geek, so I like buying the new version when it gets released. This year I was waiting for the new HX series and usually Sony announces something in March at the latest. But this year they announced the HX50V in late April. By that time I had already purchased the new Panasonic ZS30 which is the Panasonic's version of a compact long zoom camera which competes with the HX series. After receiving the HX50V and doing some comparisons, the ZS30 is no where near the image quality of the HX50V (Or even my older HX20V for that matter). IQ on the ZS30 looked out of focus and fuzzy when you compare the image of the HX50V. The HX50V images were sharp and more detailed.I am definitely what you call a pixel peeper (Pixel peeper is someone who opens up images in full and looks for every pixel detail). I was worried with the increased pixel count that IQ would suffer. I can happily say the IQ on the HX50V has improved slightly when compared to the HX20V. The images on the HX50V are more sharp and less noise to them. While the improvement isn't earth shattering, its a step up in the right direction.****Pros****- Image quality. Image quality is still sharp and crisp. IQ has improved from last years model (HX20/30V). When I compared both the HX50V and HX20V images, the HX50V had more detail and less noise. I also compared the images to the Panasonic ZS30 and the HX50V images look WAY MORE sharper. You can also see more image details in the HX50V. Outdoor images look sharp and colorful (I would describe it as life like and not overly saturated). Indoor images look good also. With the improved SteadyShot, I was able to take less shaky indoor low light images.- 30X zoom (720mm). The extra zoom does make a difference. I was able to zoom further away. With the older HX20V I was able to zoom to the farthest mail box down the street. Now I am able to read the numbers on the mail box with the 30X zoom!- Video quality. The video on the HX50V shoots in HD camcorder quality. I have compared video with my Sony CX560V camcorder and the HX50V video is better because my videos look smoother with less shake in them. When I shot a video with the HX50V and walked around, their was minimal shake in the video. When I did the same test with my CX560V camcorder, lots of shaking occurred in the video (As I expected). Sound capture remains crisp and Hi-Fi just like the HX20V. I am still blown away at how good the video is on the HX50V. The HX50V captures video at 28Mbps 1080P/60p just like my CX560V camcorder. I will now leave my camcorder home and only take this when I'm on vacation for video. The only time I will bring the camcorder is when I need the \"NightShot\" feature.- 360 Panorama. I probably won't be using this feature much, but it was fun taking a 360 panorama.- Build quality. Not only does the HX50V look like an expensive camera, but it also feels like one. It feels solid and the black metal body looks great. When I took some shots, I felt like I was holding a real camera and not a plastic toy.- No touch screen! I absolutely hate touchscreens on cameras. I especially hate it when you can't turn it off. When I had the Panasonic ZS30, it was very annoying when I accidently touch the LCD screen with my thumb while taking a shot. Touching the LCD screen would \"focus\" on to the subject (Just like on a smartphone). Touch screens on most cameras are a gimmick in my opinion and only add frustration. It made me take some bad shots unknowingly. I am happy to report the HX50V does not have a touchscreen. Sony if you are reading this, please please please DON'T EVER implement this feature!- Pop-up flash. The flash pops up mechanically when you press the flash button. It pops up very fast in a blink of an eye. On the previous model (HX20V) the pop up flash was powered up and down by a motor. On the HX50V you have to press it down to lock it back down. I prefer the non-motor because its one less thing to break on me. The flash fills the room nicely (Perfect for indoor shots).****Cons****- While the IQ has improved from the previous model(HX20/30V), Sony should have not increased the Mega Pixel count. Had Sony not increase the MP, I bet the images would look even better. I think most consumers who purchase this type of camera are informed enough to know more MP doesn't equal increased IQ.- The HX50V can not display battery life left in minutes. With the previous HX20/30V model you were able to view how much battery life you had left in minutes displayed on the screen (As long as you used the FG1 \"InfoLITHIUM\" batteries). The HX50V uses the BX1 batteries which do not have the \"InfoLITHIUM\" feature. All you get on the HX50V are 4 bar battery meters. I will miss that feature on my HX20V because I could always prepare to preserve battery life right down to the exact minute!- It's a little on the pricey side but keep in mind it does include wi-fi picture transfer.- Size. The HX50V is slightly bigger and heavier. I can definitely feel a difference when I use a camera neck strap. My HX20V felt lighter (As it should since it weighs slightly less than the HX50V).- LCD screen is almost useless in bright sunlight. When I compare the LCD screen from the HX20V, they are identical.- Battery door is still flimsy and cheap. If you don't handle the battery door like The Hulk, it should be fine though.****Wishlist for next years HX series upgrade****- NightShot for video. I wish Sony would add the NightShot feature on this camera. I know it probably won't happen since Sony has been removing the NightShot feature from its camcorder line up (Unless you fork over $$$$ to buy the top of the line model).- Produce a \"InfoLITHIUM\" battery for the HX50V so that battery life can be viewed in minutes.- Lower cost model. Sony could add a lower model and remove the wi-fi feature for those who don't need or want it and knock off $50-$100 bucks.Overall this camera is a great improvement from last year's HX20/30V and a great upgrade for anyone who is a fan of the HX handheld series. Improved image quality, 30X zoom and longer battery life is what sold me and I'm glad I upgraded. This camera makes me feel confident I won't miss a shot and able to take a good shot no matter how far the subject is. A wonderful vacation camera. I have purchased the HX5V, HX9V and HX20V each year they came out. This is the best handheld zoom camera to buy. It takes sharp pictures and amazing video. I have since sold my Panasonic ZS30 and kept the HX50V as my main camera. The HX50V is the clear winner and takes the crown of best handheld zoom camera to date.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "HX50V is a winner", "Author": "Eager Beaver", "ReviewID": "R3POY8TMHOQ7KX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a Sony HX9V a few years ago and when I saw the announcement for the HX50V with its 30x zoom, I thought: \"Upgrade time has arrived.\" The delivery van showed up yesterday and I gave the camera a thorough test drive today. There is good news and bad news. Let's get the bad news over first.The first photo I tried to make was of a target about 70 cm (28\") wide at a distance of about 1 m (39\"). The camera wouldn't focus. I tried my HX9V and it focused perfectly. I called Sony and asked what was going on and the nice man suggested my camera must have a manufacturing defect and I should send it back to Sony for a new one. Eventually I figured out that this is complete nonsense. The compromises required to get a 30x zoom into such a small camera meant that the minimum distance at any given zoom just has to be more than the zoom on other cameras. Bummer, but in practice, you don't normally have to get very close with a high zoom.The second piece of bad news is that after extensive testing (see below) I concluded that the only f-stops available are f/3.5, f/4, f/4.5, f/5, f/5.6, and f6.3. When there is plenty of light, I would have liked f/8, f/11, and f/16, but they aren't available. Also, the fastest shutter speed is 1/1600 sec.The flash is not automatic, like on the HX9V. You have to manually release it. This is a real minus. The camera should figure out on its own when it needs the flash, pop it up, and use it.The menu system is quite complicated and it is difficult to find things. For example, there is a MENU button, which when pushed, displays a column of icons, one of which is Settings. But not all the settings are under Settings. Some are in the column of icons. Furthermore, which items are available depends on the position of the mode wheel on top of the camera. All in all, it is confusing and poorly thought out. All the settings should be under Settings and the menu items should be identical no matter where the wheel is, even if some of them are not currently applicable  (e.g., ISO in automatic mode).There is no raw mode so you are stuck with the in-camera processing. In truth though, it is not bad. You can tweak some of the parameters if you want.The layout of the buttons could be better. The button for shooting videos is in an awful place and can be pushed by accident much too easily. Also, unlike the HX9V, there is an exposure offset dial on top of the camera. Nobody is ever going to use this. It should have been a menu item and the video button placed at the top.There are several features that warm the cockles of marketeers' hearts, but are useless to photographers, like smile and blink management. Sony: no doubt you are working on automatic detection of people blowing their noses. Please don't include it in the next model and get rid of the rest of it. Just make the shutter lag short and let the photographer decide when to take the photo.The camera has WiFi to transfer photos to a computer, but WiFi is much slower than USB, so why bother?Completely inexcusable is that there is no manual in PDF form on Sony's Website. There is a very abbreviated and largely useless manual in the box. Sony did, however, build an extensive Website telling all about the camera, in over 200 pages of HTML. Unfortunately, you have to click on them one at a time to see everything. I bit the bullet, downloaded all of them, and created a PDF manual for other people. I put it at www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/photos/hx50v/manual.pdf for you to download.Now the good news. The camera is small and light and handles very well, just like the other HX... cameras. The screen is clear and bright. The 30x zoom is smooth and the images at 30x are amazing. Some people who reviewed the camera before it was released were whining about the large number of pixels (20 M) on the small (1/2.3) sensor. These people should buy a Nikon D4. It has a full frame sensor and really big pixels. It is also very expensive, heavy, and doesn't fit in your pocket.To test the HX50V, I shot a series of photos first using automatic (Superior) and then in programmed mode, at ISO 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600, at  different focal lengths. The test shots are at www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/photos/hx50/series-1.zip. These were made in Amsterdam on a bright but windy day. From the EXIF data, you can see all the settings. However, note that the focal length in the EXIF data is the true focal length from the point of view of the camera's optics. To get the 35mm equivalent focal length, multiply the focal length shown by 5.58. For example, 129 mm has the field of view of a 720 mm lens on a (D)SLR.Also note that holding a camera with a 720 mm lens steady requires some care, even with Steady Shot. In my test shots, I tried hard, but you might detect a bit of blurring in some of the shots.As mentioned above, the smallest f-stop is f/6.3 and the fastest shutter speed is 1/1600 sec. When I forced the ISO to 1600, the little microprocessor inside the camera was probably sweating bullets, thinking: \"Why 1600? Even at 1/1600 sec and f/6.3, there is far too much light coming in; what is this guy thinking? That he is at the North Pole at midnight in December?  As you can see, the ISO 1600 photos are way overexposed. Fortunately, in automatic mode, the camera defaults to ISO 80 when there is enough light. The photos in the zip file have names like 101A-ISO=0400.jpg, where the first number is a sequence number which is the same for all the shots at the same location. The A photos are at 24 mm, the C photos are at 720 mm, and the B photos are in somewhere in between.My conclusion is that there is no visible noise up to ISO 400 and surprisingly little above it. The zoom is great and you can see tremendous detail at 30x. There doesn't appear to be much barrel or pincushion distortion although no doubt if you shoot targets in a lab, you'll find some. In practice, despite the long zoom, distortion isn't an issue.After making the above tests, I made more tests of the zoom in automatic (Superior) mode. In www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/photos/hx50v/series-2.zip, you will see photos made from 24 different places, again at 24 mm, some intermediate zoom, and 720 mm. These shots show the power and clarity of the 30x zoom.I also tested the macro capabilities. You can get subjects in focus at a distance of 2 cm from the lens. A shot of a 25 mm x 35 mm stamp is at www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/photos/hx50v/stamp.jpg . Observe how clear the hairs on the monkey's chin are.I gave the video a short test. It seems OK. For decent HD, be sure to choose AVCHD and not MP4 in the menus though, and set the bit rate to 28 Mbps. Having both AVCHD and MP4 seems redundant though, since both are containers that can hold any codec, any frame size, and any bit rate.To conclude, despite a few design flaws, the HX50V is a great choice for someone who wants a pocket camera with a long zoom and excellent image quality.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT Camera", "Author": "Lon Townsend", "ReviewID": "R1538V8V78ZOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great. I can not describe all of the features, but for this price you do not have to go any further. I had one problem with the speed between taking pictures if the camera was on auto mode. This mode fixes any errors, blurs, etc and it gives you a clean sharp great image. It was a class 10 high speed 32 GB SDHC card I was using. I ordered the  SanDisk Extreme 64 GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s SDSDX-064G-X46 card and this fixed the problems. I can take pictures almost instantly after each other and I get over 1000 shots. Put this card with this camera and you could not ask for better. Now I have not had this combination long, but I love it. I've had multiple cameras for 50 years, I used to teach the old film photo at a community college. Read the features you get with this camera, but I also recommend putting the faster card in. Before I had to wait a few seconds between shots.

Great resolution and brightness; zoom in on a photo and the detail is very fine.The image stabilization works really well and is a must for a handheld camera with a large telephoto zoom lens. The stabilization works well in low light too. Love the flexibility the large zoom ratio affords. Max optical zoom, handheld and no blur. Best stabilization I have seen in a small camera.The bright and clear display provides the operator with a wealth of information with good presentation / navigation. It is not a touch screen which I much prefer.Functionally the camera worked very well. A myriad of features. Haven't used all the different functions yet. Buttons and rotary switches have good feel and are logically placed.Very light and small size considering the size of the lens and all the electronics they have to cram inside.PC connection fine. GPS locates quickly (obviously outside only), haven't tested its accuracy.The movie quality is very good. I took a few short clips at the highest resolution and they displayed well. Haven't tried the 3D feature.I always carry a pocket camera, currently this Sony or a Canon Power Shot ELPH. There are times when the smaller and lighter camera (Canon) is more appropriate; hate giving up the power of the Sony.Excellent value for the money if you want high quality pictures in a small package.I have already taken some great pictures. Ordered camera from Amazon on April 30.Cons1. The battery compartment is poorly designed. It is not obvious which way to insert the batteries especially in low light. Even in the correct orientation some pressure is needed to enable it to slot home. The battery can be wobbled side to side in the slot and it drags on the sides when inserting. The battery catch engages with a small wiggle of the battery; doesn't feel positive. The worst issue is the battery compartment cover. The latch is sloppy and feels like it could release if bumped. It is difficult to know when it is closed fully. The cover itself hinges straight out (90 degrees) on the short side exposing the narrow hinge to easy damage. The cover when closed is not tightly held; a fingernail can be slipped underneath the lip. It sticks up enough that it will snag on clothing and is not dust tight. In the last week I have had the cover come open twice. I'm being more careful to ensure it is latched; may have to use a small piece of tape on the latch.2. I didn't like the lack of a comprehensive paper user's manual. The supplied sparse documentation is inadequate to be able to operate the camera except the basic functions. This camera is highly sophisticated and the supplied guide is suitable for a cheap snap camera. The built-in on-screen \"In Camera Guide\" is hard to read except in a darkened room. It is not the same as reading and flipping pages in a book or on a PC screen. Too little information is displayed per screen and navigation that works well for adjusting the camera settings, functions poorly for reading the guide. I checked  on line for a better version and none exists. The available video tutorials are for other Sony cameras. Why can't the \"In Camera\" guide be provided in PDF?3. I didn't like the manual pop up flash design. I could see the mechanism being easily damaged and the cavity will become a dirt trap. There appeared to be plenty of space for it to be built-in as on other small cameras. The added height can't make that much difference. It does work well but I don't see it lasting long in the great outdoors. It is also where I place my left forefinger to steady the camera; so my natural grip has to change when using the flash. The camera has such good low light capability that I don't see much need for the flash.4. Battery life is not the greatest and charging with the supplied USB charger is slow. Definitely invest in a second battery and a regular type charger.5. The HDMI socket in exposed on the bottom of the camera. Dirt will enter and it will be easily damaged.6. This camera is not dustproof or water resistant (Sony states this quite clearly). Not a good choice for desert or marine environments. A case is a must for this camera in all environments. Not sure why Sony doesn't supply a soft case with the camera. The jacket case (not dust proof) optional accessory enlarges the camera so it is no longer a pocket carry and it's better suited for a larger camera. Sony's soft cases are bulky also, and are designed to be worn on the belt (which is fine too). I am using a fabric lined felt bag with a draw string and it works well in the pocket (3x5in). Sony provides these with some of their accessories.7. The display is excellent indoors but almost useless in bright sunlight. Which is a great pity, because without access to the display information you might as well just set the camera to \"Auto\". It also makes framing the picture very difficult. This is of course true of just about any modern digital camera. Sony does offer a viewfinder attachment. Otherwise, sunglasses and a large brimmed hat. The screen is polarized so don't wear polarized sunglasses if you want to take portrait pictures..", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Change not always better", "Author": "Traveln2", "ReviewID": "R2IVR5JQEK8OCM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from the HX20, which is certainly a great camera, to the HX50. The plus to the HX50 is certainly the Hot Shoe and why I changed. While both cameras take excellent photos, both cameras also have no viewfinder and in bright light it is impossible to see what you are shooting on the display, you are guessing. While quite expensive (its about the same price as the camera), you can get a digital viewfinder that attaches to the HX50 with the Hot Shoe.To me, the big downside is the flash & the WiFi. If you set the camera to either of the auto modes, the flash is not automatic as it is on the HX20. It is only automatic if you manually pop up the flash. To me this is not automatic. As for the WiFi, I cannot say that it is the quickest thing to use. Make a WiFi that is easy to connect in any WiFi area and that you can upload directly to Facebook or other social media sites and then you will have a decent WiFi. As it stands not, it is easier to just either connect the camera with a cable or insert the media card directly into your computer to upload pictures or take a picture with your phone.If you are not or cannot go the price of the digital viewfinder and have a previous version of the camera, I would not recommend changing. If this is your first camera in this series, although it is not inexpensive, you might not be bothered by the lack of automatic flash and the lack of a viewfinder would be the same no matter what brand you purchase. As stated previously, this camera, like its predecessors takes excellent photos.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrific Camera", "Author": "Robert Lyons \"RGL\"", "ReviewID": "RI6JC11NETVSX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Truth in advertising, I am not a professional photographer not even close.  I like to take pictures but rarely get very artsy with it.  My problem was that I was quickly getting tired of the inadequacies of my previous camera.  It was a good small multipurpose camera but too often I missed getting the picture I wanted because it was either too slow or just didn't have the capability to do what I wanted it to do.  When I shopped for a new camera I looked extensively at larger cameras in the 18 to 24 ounce range.  After reading a review on Amazon about one of those cameras I decided I wanted something smaller.  As the person said, it was a great camera but whenever they went out to take pictures they would look at it, decide it was too large and then grab a smaller camera.  I knew it would be that way with me also.  I wanted a camera with at least a 20X zoom that would be easy to use and would fit in my pocket.  I narrowed it down to this one and two others.  Based on overall reviews on Amazon and reviews I read on photography sites I opted for this one even though it was more expensive than the others.  I have not been disappointed.  I used this at my daughters wedding and then again on a trip we took to New Orleans afterwards.  It has done everything extremely well.  It is very easy to use and easy to navigate to all of the functionality it has and there is a lot.  All I know is that people were impressed with the pictures I was able to get given lighting conditions at the wedding.  Of course this has a 30X zoom, which is greater than I probably needed but the zoom is fantastic and there were very few instances where shaking was a problem.  In fact I can only think of one.  Shaking had been a problem with my previous camera which had a markedly smaller zoom capacity.  There is still a lot for me to learn about the camera but the beauty of it is the camera when left to it's own devices takes exceptionally good pictures so I can take my time playing with the functionality.  Just a couple of words about some of the other functionality of the camera.  I asked a friend of mine who knew nothing about the camera to take a movie of the wedding ceremony.  It came out extremely well even down to being able to hear everything that was said.  I tried the panorama functionality in New Orleans and nothing could have been easier.  I was used to having to stitch things together with my old camera.  With this one you simply sweep the camera across the area.  Nothing could be easier and it worked very well.  I wasn't very interested in WIFI.  It isn't difficult at all to hook this to your computer or pull the memory card and put it in the computer but I tried it out anyway.  It was easy to set up and surprisingly worked very well.  I had set up a WIFI connection for a friend of mine's camera and found it cumbersome and very slow.  This was easy and relatively fast.  BTW my friend sent back their camera.  I'll probably still mostly transfer pictures by cable because it is easy and faster but it's nice to know that you can use the WIFI if you want to.  For me and my purposes this may well be the last camera I purchase.  I can't imagine needing more.  I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good camera if you keep your expectations realistic!", "Author": "Sandy", "ReviewID": "RYI2WO068I7VS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had many digital cameras through the years, as I'm a camera addict.  My main cameras are a Canon 60d slr and a Sony NEX 5n.  I use the slr when image quality is of utmost priority, but I don't like to lug it and several lenses around all the time.  I use the Sony NEX 5n for most of my everyday shooting, but my longest zoom lens for that only goes to 200m.  I wanted a camera that was purse or jacket pocket sized with a long zoom for taking on walks and for that unexpected photo opportunity.I knew that a 20 MP camera with a tiny sensor and huge zoom simply could not produce photos with image quality to compare to my other cameras, so I went into it with realistic expectations. After several hundred photos, I would say the HX50V meets or exceeds my expectations for image quality.I have a few frustrations with this camera, but some of them I knew about going into it.  For instance, having to charge the battery in-camera puts the camera out of commission while it's recharging.  This necessitated the purchase of an external battery charger.Some of the settings are buried in the menu and cumbersome to get to, such as the \"format\" setting to reformat the memory card.  It's a struggle to get to \"format\",  and I like to reformat the card every time I download a batch of photos.Image stabilization works well on the camera.  The colors are very accurate, particularly when you have the color setting set to to R to achieve more natural looking photos.  The auto white balance seems to do a good job.It seems to me that there is a bit of a lag when hitting the review button....like the camera takes a bit longer than I'm accustomed to to write to the card.  I'm using a 10x speed card.When researching travel zooms, I narrowed it down to the Canon SX280 HS and the Sony HX50v.  I chose the Sony mainly for the 30x zoom over Canon's 20x, and extra megapixels to allow for more cropping.  The battery life on the Sony is rated at 400 shots compared to Canon's 260 shots, also.This is not a camera for someone who requires Dslr quality photos.  Images, when viewed at full size, frequently resemble water color paintings.  They look fine when viewed at a size to fit most monitors.  I haven't printed any of my photos yet, but I'm guessing that if I tried to print an image at anything above 8x10 it would likely present that water color painting effect.I would not want this to be my only camera, but as a sidekick to my other cameras I think it's going to meet my needs.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Zoom, Good Wide Angle, Good Value", "Author": "Truvor", "ReviewID": "R1NSXVCNSXSVHB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While it cannot compare to the new full frame cameras, this point & shoot is a great portable value for the a serious shooter.

The 1080p video quality is acceptable, but you're not shooting an indie film with this camera.

Low light shooting is quite acceptable, but grain starts becoming more and more apparent with higher ISOs. Still for a P&S; the low light image quality is quite good.

She and her friends organize and model in fashion shows to raise money for Children's Hospital and other charitable organizations.  For many years I have been taking pictures and video of the events.  I am almost embarrassed to admit that we have several HD camcorders; sometimes I hand hold one and simultaneously record on a couple others that are set up on tripods and then combine the footage.  But it gets to be too much work, so lately for both pictures and videos my favorite device is the Sony SLT-A65 camera for which I have a number of capable lenses and accessories.Last week I was coerced into participating in one of the shows myself.  My wife decided that she wanted to take some photos of me in the WWII Air Corps \"pinks and greens\" Uniform that I went on stage with along with a woman who was dressed as my bride.  My wife is a slightly built woman; she found the A65 and the large zoom lens I had mounted on it that day to be large and unwieldy.  I normally carry a backpack full of lenses, a tripod and other accessories when we take the A65 somewhere.  My wife pointed out that on most occasions we do not have it along.Our other smaller cameras, cell phones, and tablets take pictures that are acceptable for many types of occasions.  As I mentioned they are getting a little older and their capabilities obviously are very limited compared to more modern DSLR type cameras. Sometimes we still get really good pictures from them, but after you are spoiled by a camera with a large sensor and a lot of modern features it can be frustrating to use them. So my feeling was that we did not need or even want another small camera.  But my wife felt differently and she went on the lookout for a camera that she would feel comfortable using.  She wanted a camera small enough that we would actually have it with us most of the time, but something that would capture better images than what we could get with our phones or other older small cameras.When my wife pointed out the DSC-HX50V camera to me at a local retailer I remained skeptical.  I asked her once again why we would want another camera with a sensor just a fraction of an inch larger than the one found in an iPhone? (1/3\" vs 1/2.3\")  But most of the time when she is happy I am happy.  So after a few days of mulling it over we got one.  She was right and I was wrong.  The camera is amazing.  We have had it just a couple of weeks, but it keeps suprising me.  I have become a believer.  The camera just takes excellent photos.  The videos are also incredible.  Because of the camera's relatively deep depth of field, focusing for video is not as much of a challenge for it.The HX50V has in camera HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing that works incredibly well.  You press the button, it takes several pictures using different settings and combines them to give you a better picture than the sensor would normally be capable of taking.  It also has the external multipurpose shoe.  I bought an adapter so that I can use a third party external flash and also my radio flash trigger that can set off multiple flashes simultaneously. This feature is far more handy than most people might realize.  I have been using an inexpensive flash that works with the automatic TTL features with my Sony A65.  The TTL works with this camera as well firing off a test flash to a asses the lighting and adjust the power of the flash.There is only one caveat with using an external flash.  To get it to work one most first open the internal flash with the camera in a mode that will use the flash.  Then turn on the external flash.  Then close the internal flash.  If the camera goes into standby the procedure needs to be repeated.Most impressive of course is the zoom lens combined with the great image stabilization.  I was able to take pictures from the Space Needle of ships and cranes at the Port of Seattle approximately two miles away for a friend of mine.  He has an import export business and wanted pictures for his web site.  The images turned out great handheld without a tripod.  My A65 has good in body stabilization also, but my longest lens is 300mm.  I usually put the camera on a tripod if I want good results in full zoom.  So this little camera has incredible reach even without a tripod.  Some of the HDR features can be used to make the pictures turn out clearer than with image stabilization alone.  This also allows one to get clear images in low light.One of the features that I didn't realize would be useful for us was the wifi.  As it turns out it is extremely convenient to be able to send your images from your camera to your phone or tablet when you are out and about.  My wife set up a display at a museum recently and it was very nice to show her the pictures in a larger format while we were still there.  You can also control the shutter and zoom from your phone while seeing the scene live.  Then the picture you take is instantly uploaded.  I didn't realize that it could also display a slide show on our HDTV wirelessly through our Sony Blu-Ray player.  Of course you can also upload to your computer through wifi as well... which if you haven't taken hundreds of photos can be convenient.So to summarize... the DSC-HX50V is a great camera.  It is small enough that when you see something that you wish you could take a picture of you might just have it with you.  The pictures actually come out looking better than you expect that they will much of the time.  Instead of feeling disappointed that we failed to capture the essence that we were hoping for we seem to be saying \"wow\" that is almost as good as being there.  And the extra features are quite amazing also and surprisingly useful.So that is kind of the end of my review, but I also wanted to discuss large sensor vs small sensor cameras.  It is the small sensor that makes it possible for this camera to have the huge amount of zoom that it does.  A full size 720mm lens would be very large and expensive and I am unaware of any that can go full wide angle as the one that comes on this camera can.  The technology behind the sensor on this little camera is quite amazing... it is obviously much more efficient with the smaller amount of light it is sampling than larger sensors are.  Also the digital trickery that the tiny computer inside the camera is able to perform to get the most out of the sensor is quite amazing as well.A camera with a small sensor currently cannot do everything that a camera with a large sensor can do.  Cameras with larger sensors take larger lenses that have larger apertures and they can collect much more light.  This obviously helps with their low light capabilities, but even more importantly from an artistic perspective... without digital trickery cameras with small sensors generally can not achieve as narrow a depth of field (or focus). A narrow depth of field is one of the primary tools that photographers use to create beautiful artistic photos. That is one of the primary reasons why in this time of miniaturized everything you still see photographers running around with giant cameras with massively large lenses.There are excellent articles discussing this if you search for \"Full Frame Equivalence\" in a search engine.I will try to summarize here.  A camera with a \"full frame\" 35mm sensor has a sensor that is 36mm by 24mm or 864 sq. mm.  My beloved Sony SLT-A65 has an APS-C sensor that is 23.5mm by 15.6mm or 366 sq mm.  The DSC-HX50V has a sensor that is 6.2mm by 4.6mm or 28.52 sq mm.  An iPhone has a sensor that is 3.56mm by 2.68mm or 9.5 sq mm.  I think that it is fairly obvious to everyone that a tiny sensor is going to be working with a lot less light.  Small sensors must be much more sensitive than the larger sensors... and they are, but of course at this time they still cannot match the performance of a much larger sensor.  But their is another issue that is more vexing and one that is true but somewhat misleading in the specifications.The front of the lens on the DSC-HX50V has  printed on it, \"3,5 -6,3/4,3-129\".  The multi-purpose zoom lens that is currently mounted on my SLT-A65 has printed on it, \"18-200mm 1 : 3.5-6.3\".  On the HX50V the numbers 4,3-129 are referring to the zoom length of the lens which is 4.3mm to 129mm.  Because of the \"crop factor\" which is referring to the much smaller dimensions of the sensor as compared to a full frame 35mm sensor, the 35mm equivalent for the lens is marketed as having as 24mm to 720mm. This calculation is made by all major camera manufacturers and fairly well understood.The numbers that people have a harder time with are the \"3,5-6,3\" and the \"3.5-6.3\" which on both lenses is referring to the maximum \"f-stop\" for the lens at full wide angle and full zoom.  This is referring to the aperture which is how wide the blades that control how much light passes through the camera can open.  The numbers on the two lenses above are the same, so one would assume that the openings would be the same size, but this is not the case.  The opening size controls not only how much light can pass through the lens in a given amount of time, but also the depth of focus or field. If the lens has a larger opening the depth of field is shallower... less of the picture is in focus.  If you have a smaller opening more of the picture is in focus.For pictures of landscapes, mountains and many other types of scenes... having most of the picture in focus is desirable.  However photographers covet a shallow depth of field for beautiful portraits, close-ups and artistic control over the image.  Photographers pay huge amounts of money for lenses that have as wide an aperture as possible.  It is the actual dimensions of the aperture not \"f-stop\" that largely determines depth of focus.How is f-stop determined? If a 50mm lens has a maximum aperture of 25mm, it would be an f/2 lens. For the HX50V at its widest angle the lens is 4.3mm and the widest f-stop is 3.5  so the actual opening is 4.3mm / 3.5 f-stop = 1.22mm.  For comparison widest angle and the widest f-stop on the lens currently on my A65 is 18mm / 3.5 = 5.14mm.  At full zoom the HX50V lens is  129mm / 6.3f-stop = 20.47mm for its widest opening.  At full zoom the lens on my A65 is 200mm / 6.3 f-stop = 31.74mm.For my A65 which has an APS-C sensor and a 1.5 \"crop factor\" compared to a 35mm camera at my widest angle the 35mm equivalent f-stop is 3.5 x 1.5 = 5.25 f-stop, but on the HX50V which has a \"crop factor\" of 5.6 as advertised by Sony so the equivalent f-stop is 3.5 x 5.6 = 19.6. One of the most popular positive reviews on Amazon laments the loss of the higher f-stops which he mistakenly believed was 6.3 but is actually f-stop 8.  If you multiply 8 x the crop factor of 5.6 the actual equivalent 35mm \"f-stop\" is 44.8.  So his concern may not have been as valid as he felt it was.In practical terms what this means is that if you want to get a photo with a subject that is in focus and a background which has an attractive blur (known as \"bokeh\")... you basically must zoom the lens in.  This allows the aperture to open up enough at the widest F stop in Aperture mode to achieve a narrow depth of field.  I have been able to get what I consider nice \"bokeh\" using this camera this way.  This was pleasant suprise... I didn'the realize it would even be possible with a small sensor camera.The reason that we can get as much performance as we do out of tiny sensors is that they tend to be more efficient at processing light than larger sensors.  And with small processors that work with them are able to use digital trickery to get more out of them.  What really matters is the final output.  These days tiny, relatively inexpensive devices are able to turn out much higher quality images than was possible just a few years ago.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Brilliant Camera", "Author": "Lorraine P \"Lorraine P\"", "ReviewID": "R2NKT7MOKJHPD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very impressive little camera.  Have only had it a week and have not used many of its creative functions but extremely pleased so far.  Spent several days traveling and used this in sunshine, pouring rain, indoors, outdoors and almost pitch dark rooms.  Shot about 500 photos. I think they are of exceptional quality. Focus is extremely sharp. Telephoto capability is spectacular. Color is stunning.  Video is fabulous.  GPS and WiFi work just fine.  I found its performance in low light conditions to be very good, though I know reviews have said that is an area where it falls short.  For the most part I couldn't be happier.  My biggest complaint is with the location of the movie and custom buttons on the back of the camera.  I was all too frequently hitting these in error and by the end of 4 days was quite tired of repeating the mistake.  The placement just seems wrong. As with all cameras of this type, the viewfinder is almost useless in outdoor daylight.  However, that didn't seem to prevent me from getting perfect shots. I am also a little concerned when I plug the USB cord into the camera.  It just isn't an easy, smooth fit. The camera is also a little bit heavier than other point and shoot's I've owned, but that's really a small issue.  Especially since I left my DSLR Nikon in my camera bag the entire week.  That was partly on purpose because I wanted to try the new camera and partly because I wanted to carry a smaller, less obtrusive camera.

I love the 30x optical zoom which was able to zoom all the way in on a mountain climber that I could barely see with the naked eye.  I also used the \"Superior Auto\" feature to get sharp pictures on the Pantheon at night from a good distance that came out super clear and without blur.  I bought it with a second battery but I never had to use it because it stayed full even after several hundred shots.With all of that said, I have a few suggestions and I listed some of them under Cons.  I take a lot of pictures with my new Samsung Galaxy S4 (smart phone) and I have to say, sometimes my pictures on my phone come out better than my Sony camera.  This is frustrating to me because you would think a dedicated camera would ALWAYS outperform a phone, but apparently the software on a phone can do a better job in many cases.  The most obvious for me were A) photos taken with odd lighting like sunbeams from the sky through the clouds and B) panoramic photos, which I explain below.  The obvious reason I still use a camera is because phones do not have a 30x optical zoom.  Also they are not 20MP.Pros:Fantastic Zoom especially for such a small camera. Quick startup. Super easy to use.  Great battery life.  Has some great \"intelligent auto\" features that makes difficult shots a lot easier.Cons:1) I had a couple issues with panoramic shots cutting off before I was done and leaving a grey space to the right, instead of cropping it correctly.  I actually prefer my Samsung Galaxy S4 for panoramic shots because I can turn the phone upright and get a taller field of vision before moving right to left.  Sony should really catch up to others on the panoramic software features.2) When it's bright outside the screen is very hard to see.  This was particularly annoying when I used it for video recording because the \"REC\" symbol is dark red and small, so I had a hard time knowing whether I was recording or not.  To confuse matters more, when you want to stop recording, you press the REC button again and the word \"Recording...\" flashes on screen for a couple of seconds.  I think it's trying to tell you that it's \"Writing to SD...\" but I kept getting confused thinking that I was \"Recording\" when really I was \"Done Recording\".3) There are MANY scene selection options but for some reason, there was not one optimized for \"Sunsets\".  I love sunset photos and my other cameras have all had scene setting for sunsets that make them simple.  I did not have time to test all of my scene settings to see which one took better sunset photos.Regardless, this is still my favorite ever digital camera.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Little camera, great photos", "Author": "Ellasgram", "ReviewID": "R2EEX30PHP8VD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a better than average point and shoot for basically photographing family babies and retirement travel.

The Movie mode has an intelligent auto mode or you can select a particular scene mode to shoot video.  There are plenty of filters to play with and you can retouch photos in-camera.  The HX-50 is extremely feature rich (it took me a couple of days to familiarize myself with it).  For example: if you take photos using the burst mode they are grouped together in the playback mode and if you tilt your camera left or right the burst of photos will play like a movie clip; or you can change the focus setting to allow yourself to manually change the focus spot before taking pictures.I love cameras but try not to compare apples to oranges -not all cameras are equal.  Manufacturers build cameras with a particular consumer in mind.  It is up to you to figure out what you want in a camera and then find the camera that suits your needs.  Look at what your habits are.  Do you want to lug around a DSLR with multiple lenses?  Do you wish you had a larger zoom but still want the camera small?  Do you like not having to worry about the settings and just snap a nice picture? Maybe you do, but have decided you want to start learning how the settings (f-stop, etc) really work and don\u2019t know where to start.

(The HX50V also accepts the Sony RX1 OLED viewfinder which also mounts/connects via the flash shoe and which matches the price of the HX50V camera itself.) I also downloaded the iPhone PlayMemories Mobile app which connects to the camera via Wi-Fi.My first outing with the camera was at a parade where I was 15-20 feet back from the curb with the HX50V mounted on a carbon fiber monopod extended to about 30\" and held aloft. Using the iPhone PlayMemories Mobile app as my viewfinder and controller, I could zoom to a point that appeared as if I were at the front of the crowd, zooming with the app's W-T zoom controller and taking a photo with the app's shutter button. The app places a reduced size image of each photo in your phone's photo album in addition to the image on the camera's SD card.My second outing with the camera was on Cape Cod where the seemingly endless 30x zoom brought distant buildings to full frame while at the wide angle setting the same buildings are hardly visible. And you can take such zoom shots hand held because of the camera's stabilization. But I recommend at least a monopod just in case.My third outing was at a folk festival at an indoor stage where I was seven rows back, though the HX50V's zoom put me in the front row. I used the external ECM-XYST1M stereo mic with stereo mics spread to the maximum 120\u00b0 and a monopod for support. The resulting AVCHD (.MTS) files played back nicely via the VLC app and looked and sounded excellent. (iMovie does not seem to accept .MTS files directly, so I am converting them to MP4 files at the same resolution.)My fourth outing was at the folk festival at an outdoor tented stage where I knew the performer and I was in the front row. I mounted the HX50V on a monopod and used the built-in camera mic for sound. The stage speakers were to my left and right. The picture results under the white tent were were not as vibrant as from the lit indoor stage, but certainly very acceptable. Likewise the sound was a bit more diffuse with some extraneous noises during quiet passages, but still quite nice.I feel that Sony has a winner with the HX50V. One pocketable camera that replaces a bag full of lenses. My Sony NEX 5N has a much bigger APS-C chip, with lower noise and greater possibilities, but the NEX 18-200mm zoom lens (27-300mm equivalent) is heavy and no match for the HX50V with 24-720mm equivalent.The viewing screen on the HX50V is the weak point in that it is nearly impossible to see in bright sunlight. Under bright conditions the choice is to use the iPhone PlayMemories Mobile app as the viewfinder or to purchase the accessory RX1 OLED viewfinder which matches (doubles) the cost of the HX50V.

My chief complaint is with the panorama function.  This worked beautifully in the HX7V. In the HX50V, the panorama suffers VERY badly from a reverse fisheye distortion.  For example, a straight road (going from your left to your right) now looks like a sharp \"U\" with the ends further away going off at a 45 degree angle.

For those that have or had the Sony DSC HX9V, you will find this camera a distinct upgrade!

The multi-function flash bracket on top functions for flash, input for a stereo mic, and where you attach an electric viewfinder; all of which are quite pricey....right now anyway.

Compared to other pocket cameras, NONE can manage hand held low light shots like this one can!! Yesterday I took a full frame  picture of the moon, hand held! Its bigger than most pocket cameras...so maybe looses half a star for that. Otherwise, top notch! BTW....the Nanguang 54000K LED variable video light is a very useful adddition for shooting video; it slides into the flash bracket on top of the camera, and can even take the place of flash too simply by turning it on before you take a picture, and you can vary the brightness!

But because the technologies have advanced, I'm pretty sure that the quality gap between the old camera makers and new ones has diminished, if not disappeared. This time, I decided to buy a new camera that would compromise my needs (GPS, good zoom) with my wife's needs (wi-fi), along with a great quality of photographs and videos.I found this camera to have what it takes to satisfy all our needs. It looks and feels great. Also takes very good pictures, which have great colours and and are sharp. I compared the quality with my friend's new Canon DSLR camera (18 MP) on his 42\" TV. Maybe I'm wrong, but mine seemed slightly grainy compared to his. If anybody did a comparison of this camera's JPEG with a DSLR camera's JPEG, it would be great to read it.It shoots two formats of videos: a telephoto MP4 and a Blu-ray AVCHD. The highest video quality is AVCHD (28 Mbps, 1920\u00d71080, 50p/60p). It really looks great, but for me the size is huge, since I have no a Blu-ray drive on my computer to stock my videos. For example, my 42 seconds clip in best quality has a size of 157 Mb. For an everyday life you can shoot in MP4 and it will be as twice as smaller or even less. I didn't play too much with videos.I've never had a GPS on any of my cameras. But it works, and it finds satellites faster than my car GPS.Now, the two reasons why I rated this camera 4 and not 5:- I expected wi-fi to work as a regular wi-fi. I thought I will be able to connect my camera to any computer through a local wi-fi and download or view pictures. But, Wi-fi works only if you install Sony's PlayMemories Home software on your Windows and Mac PC. And since I'm an Ubuntu Linux user, and Sony didn't bother making this software for Linux users, wi-fi is of no use for me. As soon as they make this software available for Linux, I'm ready to change my rating for 5.- The camera is Made in China. I have always associated Sony and \"Made in Japan\" with quality, which I can't say about \"Made in China\" products.///Update, October 15, 2013///After 3 months of use the camera is doing OK. What I dislike though, is that the Video button is right next to the spot where you hold the thumb. There were so many times that we pressed it by mistake and it started filming!I also observed that when you make shots from the closer distance (1-2 metres), the image at the edges rounds off.As I said, the camera is OK, and I stick with the rating of 4, but I think that next time I'll go for Canon brand.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT CAMERA", "Author": "Nitpicker", "ReviewID": "RW54XGJ4SK7HO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent camera.

I was taking picture like crazy and there is no way the battery lasted for 400 pictures. That is because if you take videos or view you picture, or edit  or delete them, it is easy to use up power. Having a spare battery is smart idea. I go it the night before I left. Bad idea. So it  was on the job training. Not recommended.

And this camera for its 30x zoom.  Especially since the image stabilization works best up to 30x in this type of camera.  Compared to my RX100M2, this camera has a better hand-grip.  A bigger zoom.  (I think powering up this camera is faster than the RX100M2).  But, of course, the RX100M2 has better image quality than this camera which is truly a point & shoot camera.You won't get the same quality pictures as the RX100M2 with this camera which is truly a point & shoot camera.  My RX100M2 gets those better quality pictures because of its bigger sensor.  So on those days I'm looking to just go 'pocketable' I grab these two cameras.

Lord", "ReviewID": "R3JDT9LGO7N722", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First I bought the RX100II. It was everything promised yet was returned after a weekend. The problem? It's a low-light portrait/video performer only capable of 7x zoom, and the more you zoom, the slower it gets. The best camera is the one you've got with you, and the HX50 puts awesome travel firepower in your coat. Not only does it excel at \"reaching out\" to grab the name of that freighter 3 miles off in the sunset, the image stabilization is so good you'll get clear shots despite taking them from the rolling deck of your own ship. And then, when you dip into Clear Image to try it at 60x, it still delivers sharpness.That's not merely good. It's a superb feat of engineering to shoe-horn that level of ability into a body this small. None of the popular little Canon point-and-zooms can touch this, not without pulling a tripod out of their ***. And while I'd love to have the Lumix FZ-200 with its constant f2.8 Leica lens and sport zoomability, I'd need to hire a footman from Downton Abbey to carry it for me. My wife would flatly refuse and my children, while enthusiastic, are tragically unreliable with Leicas.So there we are. If you're looking for high-IQ innards, dirt simple user interfaces or to do a professional wedding shoot, this isn't the right brush. (Thus the 4 stars.) For a spiffy handler with auto modes you don't have to worry about, video quality that eliminates the need for a travel camcorder along with surprisingly decent low-light chops, then we are talking! Again, it truly shines when you've spotted a Big Game shot and you've got about 5 seconds to reach into your pocket, turn it on, zoom it down and bag it with beautiful clarity. At that challenging task it's a joy, it's a breakthrough, and it's also a steal.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fun, Compact Superzoom UPDATED", "Author": "A. R. Hanford", "ReviewID": "R17OSEFGIWNKIT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated 03/20/2014: I am loving this camera!  It has made picture taking easy.  I've gone through about 600 shots so far and the camera has been wonderful.  I use the WiFi operation in conjunction with the PlayMemories app on our Nexus 7 tablet to take remote shots of my wife's Etsy items.  I find I'm settling on the iA+ mode most of the time, with the rare exception that I'll use P-mode to shoot with a lower ISO, increased sharpness, or refined exposure area (when taking moon shots, for example).  The wide angle lens has been great for taking interior shots, and the bokeh effect is easy to achieve.The biggest complaint I would have is that the screen is really difficult to see in full sun.  It's hard to tell how well exposed your photos are because of this.  However, I am pleased to say that when I pop the memory card in the computer, the shots are exposed well about 95% of the time.  I've been keeping the exposure dial at one click below 0 (towards -1) to help make sure my exposures aren't on the high side.Another minor quibble is that when using the WiFi control, you're unable to change exposure, ISO, aperture, exposure time, etc.  This seems like something Sony could correct with simple software changes, and I encourage them to do so!  It would greatly add to the functionality of the camera.I would recommend this camera in a heartbeat to anyone!Original review:I spent at least a week of research before finally settling on this camera after returning the disappointing Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black).  Overall, the Sony produced the best color, detail, and appearance on sites like Flickr (concentrating on the technical specs and \"reviews\" was about worthless).After receiving the camera and spending some time with it, I am noticing the same delightful results I saw in the photos taken by other HX50V users.  The small package is fantastic, and the handling is pretty decent.  Focus is fast with the auto-tracking function a bit hard to set but useful.  The zoom range is great and goes about as far as possible without the use of a tripod thanks I suppose to the optical image stabilization.  I've uploaded a photo of the moon taken handheld that demonstrates the abilities of this camera.  I highly recommend this camera, with your next best superzoom choice potentially being the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX10V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 16x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model) which is, unfortunately, a little outside my price range.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Keith DeMonbreun \"Virtual Addict\"", "ReviewID": "R2GXHQWXHNJHP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first Sony camera I've bought in several years, but I love it.

My previous digital cameras were primarily Canons, and I wanted to stick with Canon because I'm already familiar with their menu layouts, various button placements, etc. My last 'good' camera was the Canon S5, and I almost never used it in Auto mode. The S5 was just too big and I began to find that I almost never wanted to carry it with me anymore so I needed a new camera.I chose this camera because I am planning a trip to Costa Rica and wanted a camera with super zoom capabilities, but in a more compact size. I wanted a camera that I could carry with me everywhere. I needed something that would fit in my medium-sized purse. I wanted a camera that had good reviews, was released within the last year, and that was made by a company that I trusted. After hours of research, it seemed that the Sony HX50V was the best fit.This camera does so many things! I love that I can control it with the PlayMemories app on my Samsung Note 2. I can be in the group photo and use the 2 or 10 second timer timer to take photos. I've taken landscape photos in the mountains that come out beautifully. I've gotten excellent results in handheld night shots that came out quite clear. I was able to take a handheld photo of the moon zoomed in to about 45x and the photo came out clear with great definition of the craters on the moon. The image stabilization seems to work great, because my hands really are just not that steady. I set this camera up on a tripod and used my smartphone as a remote to take photos of kids with Santa at a small event just a few days after receiving the camera. The photos were then printed out and sold to the parents and they were quite happy with them. I've played around with some of the other 'gimicky' tricks this camera will do too such as make a photo look like an illustration or watercolor painting. Those were actually fun.I still have to learn how to use the manual modes on this camera before my big trip. My initial shots in manual have mostly been good, but I still need more practice before I am completely comfortable with the menus and the use of all the functions. I am working my way through the manual. The camera came with a small starter manual in the box (about 40 pages), and the complete 287 page manual is available in pdf form.

Menus are easy to get to, but the features are sometimes buried where you have to take a few steps to get to them. If you want to take long zoom pictures, the camera is pretty front heavy and the picture in the viewfinder tends to move a lot while focusing. It is best to use a tripod when you wish to take really long zoom pics.This camera fits the bill for ease of use with my travel pics. I have to sometimes climb rocks and things as that. I like the fact I can carry a tripod that is not heavy and get use out of this camera with that. I will use this camera to its full capability as I learn more of it.

Manual control, high-res screen, 30x optical zoom, hot shoe, wifi and GPS.  Unfortunately, in use, it is a very poor experience.First of all the controls are very convoluted.  When shooting in manual you have to hit the center button on the control wheel every time you want to change shutter speed or aperture. Go back to focus with a half press of the shutter, and then you have to hit the center button again to change either. Okay, so you don't necessarily buy a camera like this to shoot manual.  But I am used to shooting manual with my SLRs, and it is nice for Sony to include it on this camera, but its implementation is so poor that it is pretty useless.  The menu is pretty laborious in use as well as everything is arranged in a continuous scroll.  Furthermore, everything you can tune, such as sharpness and noise, has no fine control.  Each setting has just three settings.Well, one would hope that if you can learn to live with all of the operational issues, the image quality would make up for it.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Image quality is poor.  Even at base ISO all pictures have that watercolor effect where everything is smeared.  Every image from this camera simply lacks any fine detail.  You do not have to pixel peep to see this.  Even at 8x10 the smearing is evident.  I took a photo of a brick house and all the mortar between the bricks was either washed out or wavy even without zooming in.  I am aware this is common among cameras with such high resolution on tiny pinky nail sized sensors.  I'm sorry, but 20 megapixels is just way too much for a sensor this small.  In my experience 12 megapixels is the sweet spot for compact cameras.To make things even worse, the camera I received had a lens centering defect.  The left side of all pictures I took were blurred while the right side was sharp(er).  This was very evident at 24mm-35mm and less evident from 35mm on.  This is just something to be aware of and look for if you happen to buy this camera.Then there is the screen.  I have never had so much trouble seeing a camera screen outdoors.  Even with the brightness turned all the way up it is nearly impossible to make out any detail on the screen in daylight.  The screen is high resolution but appears to be very low quality.  It is extremely reflective and the lighting is also uneven.  Comparing this screen to the one on my Canon S100 outdoors is a totally different experience.  While both are harder to view outdoors, the HX50V screen is far more difficult to use.  All I could do was look for highlights in the image, such as a white car here or a bright sign there, to line up my shot.Finally, the camera is metal on the front but the rest is plastic.  I don't mind plastic when it is of high quality, but the plastics used here appear very thin and cheap.  I am not sure how long the battery door on the camera would last as it feel very flimsy.  The camera feels lighter than it should and the quality feels lower than it should for a premium compact camera.Ultimately, the lens defect on the unit I received was unacceptable and I returned it. I probably would have returned it even if it was not defective mainly because the screen is so hard to see and the images lack detail.

Besides the grainy images, if you quickly point and shoot, nine out of ten times the image will be so washed out that you end up with a white ghostly image.

It has lots of options that make it useful; however, to me, the camera feels a bit cheaply made, more like a plastic toy camera...which is a shame. I was hoping it would have the build quality of my canon G15. I feel like I have to be careful pressing the buttons on the back in fear that I'll break something, oh, and the screen is very difficult, if not impossible to see in bright light. Also, the camera seems very slow, no matter how fast a card I put in it. With those issues aside, the camera seems to make decent photos and has a great zoom.I'm somewhat disappointed with the camera due to the build quality issue and the overall slowness of the camera, but hoping that the other good things outweigh it in the end. If I had paid full retail for the camera, I would have returned it and kept looking.UPDATE: 5/27/14I've been using the camera for about a week. So far, I can say that the slow write speeds are getting frustrating. I'm using a UH1 class 10 32GB card with a 90MB/S write speed and it's still slow. After a burst shot, you have to wait a few seconds (5-10) before you can shoot again. I don't know why they aren't releasing the HX60 here in the US when it's out in many countries elsewhere.

Kikuchi", "ReviewID": "R304MADP19J494", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this camera about a month and have done a fair amount of shooting with it.  I am very computer literate and have been doing pro-sumer level photography for many many years (I'm 60).  This camera has some really nice features in terms of taking pictures, but it has WAY too much junk included which increases the price unreasonably.  The wi-fi method of getting pictures out of the camera insists on using ONLY Sony's software, which wants to control every picture on your computer, in my case tens of thousands.  It takes forever to just open up.  It also makes my preferred photo manipulation software not run (Paint Shop Pro), so I removed it from the computer.  Now the wi-fi won't send pictures; actually I'm fine with that as I am happy using a USB connection.  However that was very difficult to set up, involving a lot of menu diving.  It won't be something that I'll be willing to do regularly, which means I have to set the camera so that it won't charge with a USB.  Actually I can live with that, but the problem is that I have paid for features that I can't use simply because they are too complex and hard to manipulate, and the software is too automatic.--There is no manual.  The instructions are semi-helpful, but don't run correctly in my (Chrome) browser.  Downloading the .pdf file helped, and that is possible (now).  It is completely included in the camera itself, extremely inconvenient to access, and you can't fiddle with the camera while reading as the camera only does one thing at a time.  BAD.--No Macro lens.  There is a macro setting buried deeply in the menus.  I haven't figured out how to use it.--All sorts of options are included for altering your pictures in the camera.  First, you are working with a 3 inch screen here and can't tell what you are doing.  Second, they are dumb.  Anyone who needs this sort of camera most likely already is adept at photo manipulation software.  This should be left out and the cost lowered.--Picture quality is pretty good for a compact camera; however the menu diving to get the settings right takes so long that the picture opportunities are lost.  Presumably this will improve with use.--I would prefer a slightly smaller camera, but the large zoom may make it worthwhile.  I haven't really needed the zoom yet so am not in love with it yet. :)", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "focus issues", "Author": "ben", "ReviewID": "RO2CHRVCXP3YW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "item had a hard time focusing for me during the daylight sometimes didn't focus at all, If I need ZOOM I go cannon sx50, if I need 20.2 mp, I go my brand new sony RX100 which has stunning photos.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good camera.", "Author": "T2lhe", "ReviewID": "R9NARWE0WN3ZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, this camera has all the features i'm looking for.
