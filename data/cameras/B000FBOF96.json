Free DDNS service makes this the best buy. I have another camera, Linksys, and I had to pay for this service. I defitely will drop it when it comes up for renewal. No more Linksys camera for me!After a few days of use..I still love it! I just found out that I can access the camera with my Mac via Firefox browser. This alone beats all other cameras in the market! Set up the motion detector to email pictures is a breeze. You can also set the camera to periodically send a picture, motion or not. The only thing that you could say it is less than the Linksys is it could not send a video. Linksys video only lasts 30 seconds anyway. Highly recommended.8/21/08: I have 2 of these cameras and the first one (3 yrs old) just failed. It is just not powered up doesn't matter how many times I tried. I guess it is expected. It has been reliably in service for 3 yrs. I will buy it again, when Amazon has a good deal.The camera's software works flawlessly in Mac OS. I regularly access my camera via Safari web browser. This alone beats most other camera out there. You can get to it from either Windows or Mac. I set it up to email the jpeg to my Blackberry and view the picture there. Could not figure out how to do this on an iPod though.3/20/09: When the 2nd camera failed, I thought the power supply was the culprit. I bought a $15 power supply from W**T and guess what? It works again. So I now both of my cameras work again! If your camera failed, likely it is the power supply!Also, I can access my cameras from my iPod touch (live) using the supplied Safari browser when I have a wifi connection.

Werkema", "ReviewID": "R2SV619L6NH8HP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera last week so we could watch our new infant puppy when we're not at home. The camera has been running for 3 days consistently and we are very happy with our purchase. However, we encountered a few troubles.We are not IT people, but consider ourselves computer savvy. After realizing that the camera did not come with an ethernet cord, which is required for initial setup, we attempted to hardwire the camera to our desktop using the cable that was connecting our wireless router to the desktop. Then, we connected the desktop to the router wirelessly. This seemed great in concept, and it probably would have worked. Unfortunately, we were having a great deal of difficulty. So, we obtained additional cables and tried to set it up again the next day. Everything seemed functional, and then the next morning, everything quit. It seemed that after purchasing the camera and having to upgrade our wireless router firmware, and after the camera trying to access and change our DHCP settings, our wireless router finally died. It was four years old, which is apparently considered old.So, we bought a new NetGear router. This time the install was seamless. Everything worked exactly as the install instruction said it would. We had one problem in that we couldn't access the camera from the internet. I called tech support and the problem was solved within 20 minutes. They were very helpful and knew exactly what to do. The software for NetGear autoconnects to the UPNP settings of the camera. When you set up port forwarding, the port is already in use. So, you have to turn off auto UPNP on the camera so that the router does not see it there. Then, the port is available for the incoming web traffic. Once we did this and changed the port number, everything worked flawlessly.I recommend this camera to people who are computer savvy. You do not need to be an IT person to use this, but it definitely helps to know your way around your router settings. Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase and would buy another one.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Have 2 cameras and they are excellent!", "Author": "ZoMan", "ReviewID": "RCRLI8QM80PH8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera is excellent once you set it up wirelessly.

I have a bunch of them.  They are small enough that you can tuck them inside stuff, cheap enough that you can use a bunch of them, and the picture quality is adequate if you put them in the right places.  Don't use them for your wedding snaps, though...They can send periodic pictures by email, take bracketing pictures (say 5 pictures before the trigger, and 5 after, a second apart,) and they can store the snaps internally, email them, or ftp them to a server somewhere. They can send to 3 different email addresses, and they have 5 triggering conditions including time of day and motion detection, each of which can do different stuff with the pictures.  The JPEGs are about 27k at 640x480, so they won't kill your email.  This one uses 4 watts, so they will run forever off a cheap UPS if someone turns off the power to your house.  The wired cams use 2 watts.  Each camera has a webserver built in, which can show a single page with 3 other cameras' pictures on it.  Configuration is a breeze.  Really.Only downside I have found is that they do WEP not WPA.  I use an old access point just for the cameras.

Our list of wants was pretty short: We wanted a cam that would email us when there was activity and store images that could be accessed online. After trying some of the cheaper consumer Wireless IP NetCams and been disappointed by them in various ways we decided to try the Panasonic BL-C20A.The BL-C20A looks like the answer we were looking for. Its low-light performance is pretty good and its a range of notification, image storage and image capture options make it very practical for our purposes. Rather than list the options, I'll just tell you how I set ours up.After establishing the camera's basic settings by hard-wiring it to our network for a short bit, I switched it over to wireless networking and installed it on the ceiling. The most difficult part of that process was running the 10' long adapter power cable through the ceiling to a spot in a closet where I could install the wall-wort power adapter. Once installed there I found I could get great video of our front door and foyer.The next step was to set up the camera's \"triggers.\" The BL-C20A can store five different trigger configurations that dictate how and when the camera captures images and what it does with them. Each trigger has an on/off setting (so you can easily activate and deactivate saved settings), a setting for what time of day and days of the week the trigger is active, an option that allows you to capture images at specific intervals or when there is motion in the frame, a set of options that dictates the number, size and frequency of images capture when motion is detected, what to do with the captured images, and an email notification option that lets you know when the camera has detected motion.Captured images can be stored on the camera's internal web server, emailed to a list of three recipients, or stored on an external FTP server.I set up three triggers. The first captures two 320x240 pixel images every second there is motion in the frame and stores them on the camera's web server. The camera canstore up to 255 images before it starts deleting older images to make room for new ones.My second setting sends 4 images taken at one second intervals to my wife and I by email when motion is detected. This has its positive and negative effects. On the plus side, we get real-time notification whenever someone comes in our front door, but since each image is sent in a separate 7K email message a busy foyer can fill up our inbox pretty quickly.The third trigger stores two 640x480 images each second motion is detected on my off-site FTP server.We plan to leave the first trigger on at all times. The second two triggers we'll turn on when we're away on vacation.The biggest downside of the BL-C20A is it supports WEP wireless security protocol but not the more secure WPA encryption that is the current industry standard. Supporting WEP is better than nothing, but it is easily hacked. (There are downloadable toolkits that can do it in minutes, so I set the cam up on a separate network that's isolated from our primary LAN.) The frame captures aren't picture perfect. They have all the charm you expect from a security cam video capture and little more, but that's all we needed for our application.Overall we're happy with this camera and plan to acquire one more so we can easily check on our house when we're away at work or out on vacation.If you can run Ethernet to your camera location you might look at the wired version of this NetCam, the BL-C1A. Not only is it about $90 cheaper, but since there is no wireless it'll help keep your LAN more secure.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "does work with mac", "Author": "E.
