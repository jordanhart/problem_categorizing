{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very happy with this camera!", "Author": "yayaju", "ReviewID": "R2JCOL8EAQLZXW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for this camera for a couple months and I finally got it through Amazon. I've used it for 5 days now and so far I am very happy with this little camera.Pros:1. I bought this camera especially for its low light capiablity. I don't like to use falsh, but often need to take pictures of kids or cat indoors. It works really well.2. The Backlight Correction HDR (inside SCN mode) works exceptionally well! Great for those high contrast outdoor sunny day situations. I'll post the sample photos for you to compare.3. Soft Skin (under SCN mode) take portrait with softer, smoother skin (less wrinkles and pimples). My skin looks much better in the picturtes!4. iSweep Panorama is very easy to use and the result is amazing! Great for landscape photos.5. Surprisingly, the \"Date Stamp\" feature is back on WX-10!!! I used to use the Date stamp on my first Sony digital camera for all the pictures I took for my son, yet I could not find any Sony camera that still had this feature when I need to get my 2nd Sony camera. WX-10 is my 3rd Sony camera and I am glad this option is back. I know many people hate to see the date printed on the photos, but I'd prefer to have the dates on my son's photos, so I can see when they were taken and how old he was in the pictures. This feature can be found under \"Menu\" - \"Tool box icon\" Shooting Settings\" - scroll down - \"Write Date\" - choose \"On\"!6. Under \"Timer\", there're 2 settings for \"self portrait\". Just choose it and point the camera to your self, the camera can detect your face and take the picture for you (without having to press the shutter button!) amazing!7. The wide angle lens is really nice. I am surprised to find out how much more room can be included in the picture taken by WX-10 than the ones taken by my old camera. (I'll post comparasion photos)There're still many features to explore, but so far so good.Cons:1. video feature: It take a few seconds for the camera to actually start recording after the record button is pressed. With my old Sony camera (DSC-W55), it starts recording almost instantly once I press the record button. Also, my old camera record video in MPEG format which can be imported into my Picasa directly and played by Picasa. The WX-10's format is MP4 (and another HD format that I don't use), which can not be imported by Picasa automatically. It was a little frustrating for me to have to import them manually to my computer (and if you gorget to do that, you might just delete all files after the pictures were uploaded, that happened to me.) I use the video feature a lot, so I guess I just need to get used to it.2. Delete: in my old camera, under the \"delete\" menu, I can choose to \"Delete all images in this folder\". I use this feature to delete all my pictures and videos in my card after they were transferred to my computer. However, WX-10 does not have this option under the \"delete\" menu. I can only choose from delete \"This Image\", \"Multiple images\" or \"All Images on this Date\". If you have photos taken on multiple days, you have no option to delete all the images in your card at once (unless you go through the tool menu to \"format\" the memory card), instead, you have to delete the photos one date at a time.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent performer for a compact", "Author": "Ammy_Evaluator", "ReviewID": "R1WAL5SM4WOXJY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've taken about 500 shots with this camera, under some fairly difficult conditions, and have mixed feelings about this camera.The great:#######1. It is easy to carry around2. Its lens is not only bright (f2.4) but is also wide (24-26mm). This works great for indoor group photographs.3. It is relatively intuitive to use, and you don't really need a manual. In addition, the entire manual is accessible on the camera!5. Its panorama mode is utterly simple to use, and the results are spectacular.6. Decent ergonomics - the controls are easy to find and operate.7. It has a very capable flash - throwing light about 10 feet away.8. The 7x optical zoom is awesome.9. You can use standard Class 4 SDHC cards! No need to buy those memory sticks.10. Supports in-camera HDR, which works rather well.The not so good:############1. While the automatic exposure seems to be fine, the image was often noisy - even in reasonable lighting conditions.2. The images taken would benefit from a bit of sharpening during post processing.3. Auto focus struggled at night, around a campfire. Most (but not all) of my photos were too unfocused to be of use.4. You need Sony's software to get at the video you shoot.Other Thoughts###########Though small in size, this camera is big on features. It comes with an amazing amount of functionality - including panoramic stitching, HDR with auto bracketing, and 1920x1080/60i video recording.Unfortunately, some of its options can be confusing. E.g., what is the difference between \"Intelligent\" Auto, and \"Superior\" Auto? Turns out, \"Superior\" does its magic by taking multiple exposures in a burst, and then combining them together into a composite. The High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode does the same thing - but also brackets the exposures before combining them. HDR ensures that you don't blow out the brightest areas in your frame (your highlights) while correctly exposing the darkest areas. Building a composite takes time - requiring an annoying pause while the camera does its thing.The camera gives you a lot of feedback about its analysis of the scene. This can be of real help when taking a picture. It indicates the type of scene (backlit, macro, portrait, etc.); environmental conditions (hand held or tripod); and whether assistance features are being activated (HDR or anti motion blur).If you are used to relying on a fill flash, note that the Auto modes won't allow the flash to be force turned on. A fill flash lets you brighten up your subject in daylight conditions where the flash would not normally be necessary. The only choice is to put in onto Program mode. This is easily my favorite mode on this camera.As with most compacts, the Manual mode is (next to) useless in this camera. You can set the aperture to only one of two values. At the wide end, this is either f2.4 or f7.1. At the telephoto end, this is f5.9 or f18. You do have more control over the ISO and shutter speed, but the process to set these is so onerous, that I preferred to avoid it whenever possible.Setting the ISO to AUTO does not work well with this camera. It ratchets up the ISO to 800, even in bright daylight, causing noise artifacts in dark areas. I ruined a number of otherwise good photos before I realized this. I'd have loved an option to set the Max ISO that the camera would pick when set to AUTO.Conclusion########Overall, I found this camera very convenient to carry around and use. Once I became familiar with its idiosyncrasies, it turned out to be a reasonably decent compact. However, if you are capturing priceless memories, my recommendation would be to seriously consider the Powershot S95. While obviously not up to DSLR quality, the S95 is a competent and plucky performer that gives you full manual control of the process, while remaining compact enough to fit in a shirt pocket. Furthermore, the WX10's battery needed charging more frequently than does my S95. In addition, unlike my S95, I often had to wait for a few seconds for the flash to recharge.My star rating reflects my \"It's Okay\" opinion about this being a reasonable camera with nothing special to write home about.Happy Clicking!", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Mostly Great Camera", "Author": "Tylast", "ReviewID": "R39YX01TWGO62G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:1) Battery Life is great.2) Very small and lightweight, but well constructed.3) Very fast focusing.4) Photos look great.5) Works great in low light (I've permanently turned off the flash in each setting).6) Going back into Scene mode remembers your last Scene choice (Nice for testing other modes for the same shot).7) Has exposure bracketing ~ so you can manually create HDR photos.Cons:1) My huge gripe is that the built-in HDR function is ONLY available as a dedicated mode under Scenes.  The HDR feature needs to be available under the Program, Manual, & both auto modes.2) The camera is slow to be ready when changing to the Scene & Auto modes.3) It has a unique USB cable, so it can't be used with other devices (none that I have anyway).4) Aperture spacing in Manual mode only has high & low (yep, only two options).  It would be nice to get a middle aperture setting.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Best Point-And-Shoot Camera That I Have Used Thus Far", "Author": "Dr. Bojan Tunguz", "ReviewID": "R3GAAQRDEWKM5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**** The Bottom Line ****This is a very good and versatile point-and-shoot camera. If you are just interested in taking good pictures under a variety of shooting conditions then this camera delivers. However, the video format that lacks support of many video organizing and editing programs leaves me disappointed. Video has become such an important part of what we've come to expect from cameras and it would have been nice to have as many uploading, editing, and viewing options as possible. I wish that this Cyber-shot camera were much better in that department.**** Picture Quality ****If taking great pictures is the thing that's the most important for you in a camera, then this little shooter will not disappoint. The pictures are very vivid and sharp. The 16-megapixel sensor will allow you to capture images that will be easy to view even on the largest monitors. The 2.4F lens delivers bright pictures that are as distortion-free as one could expect from this sort of camera.**** Build Quality ****This is a very well built and sturdy looking camera. It is slightly larger than the current crop of Canon Powershots. Nonetheless it is still not very bulky and it's very convenient for taking with you anywhere you go.**** Ease of Use ****Considering the complexity and versatility of things that you can do with this camera, the user interface is not too bad. However, it is still not overly intuitive, and you will have to dig deep within various menus if you are interested in taking the full advantage of all the options that this camera offers.**** Video ****The vide quality is very good. However, if you want to record video at the highest quality (full HD 1080/60i) you'll have to do so in AVCHD format. This is a video format used by Sony and Panasonic, and hardly anyone else. When viewing videos on HDTV directly from a camera or from a hard drive the results can be stunning. I made a short video of my neighborhood right at the time that the school bus was passing by. The video was incredibly sharp and vivid, and I felt like it was shot in some tony suburb. However, this video format is not very friendly with most of the picture/video management software, including most troublingly iPhoto and Picasa. Overall this video format is incompatible with most of Mac software. I was only able to play it with programs like VLC or Adobe Premiere, but even then the interlacing artifacts were very noticeable and distracting. The description of this camera claims that these video files can be edited in iMovie, but I have not been able to import AVCHD files into either iMovie 2009 or 2011. On Windows systems the situation is much better. Several standard Windows video players (including Windows Media Player) support AVCHD natively and play these files without any annoying interlacing artifacts. The same holds for video editing programs.The other format that this camera supports is mp4. This format allows you to shoot videos in a progressive 30p mode, but you sacrifice the resolution - these videos are not recorded in full HD format. One of the main advantages**** Connections and File Transfer ***The camera connects to the computer and the charger through a proprietary USB cord. This is not so much of a problem for transferring photos and videos (since you can in most cases do it directly from the memory card), but it is an issue when it comes to charging your camera. I am all too familiar with how easy it is to misplace one of these cords, and since it is nonstandard you cannot avail of any of your other USB cords. This is especially annoying when you travel, as you have to remember to bring a separate USB cord for each one of your devices.**** Preset Shooting Modes ****This camera has many preset shooting modes that are convenient for all sorts of shooting conditions: low light, landscape, lots of motion, soft backgrounds, beach, fireworks, etc. Because of so many various options all of them had to get a separate menu. One shooting mode that I was really impressed with was the background correction HDR. This mode allows you to take pictures of situations that have a very high contrast between well lit and underlit parts. From what I gathered HDR in this camera was accomplished with three shots in rapid succession at various exposure settings. I've been able to take really nice photographs of a dark room with large bright windows.One feature that I was really looking forward to is the Background Defocus. This feature aims to emulate the shallow depth of field that makes the DSLR photographs so dramatic. Unfortunately, this feature only works with taking pictures of faces, presumably because it relies on facial recognition to distinguish the foreground from the background.**** Some Other Observations ***** The 3D features work OK. Only one of the three different 3D settings allows you to view 3D pictures directly on your camera, while for the other two you need to attach the camera to a 3D enabled TV or monitor. IMHO, 3D is more of a gimmick than a really well implemented feature.* The panorama feature is really neat. You just sweep the camera across the landscape that you want to turn into a panorama, and the camera stitches the photos automatically. Turning photos into panoramas can be very tricky and oftentimes requires very sophisticated software. This camera takes away all of that difficulty. The price you pay, though, is that the panorama shots will be lower resolution than the highest quality pictures. They will essentially be the same resolution as the HD video.* Face recognition works great, and the camera locks onto faces very quickly.* Various timer options give you plenty of choices. My favorite timer option relies on face recognition - the camera will wait until it recognizes a face (or two) and then take the picture within two seconds.* The shooting speed is very impressive. I can take pictures even faster than with my Canon DSLR camera. Point and shoot cameras have really come a long way in this department.* The 7X zoom is very effective. This is one of the largest zooms in this camera category and it certainly delivers on high expectations.Overall, this is a very good camera, especially at its price. My rating would be 4.5 stars, but since Amazon only deals in full-star ratings I'll give it 5.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "As a combination of Size, Price and Features... It's a great deal!", "Author": "Jesse Baynard", "ReviewID": "R1NHM1A5PCOP41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally shoot with Canon DSLRs and am pretty much a snob when it comes to image quality. But I frequently found myself picking up this camera to record the moment quickly instead of taking the time to pull the 7D out of the bag and swapping out the to most appropriate lens. If you're willing to work within this cameras limitations you will find it joy to use and that it's easy to bring along anywhere. It even has a few tricks up it's sleeve that makes it better than other cameras.TOP Pros:+ Panorama mode is an amazing gimmick that pays off! It handles all the stitching and exposure blending for you... And all it requires is one button press and sweeping the camera. Sure sometimes you can see banding in very high exposure changes (like shooting the sun and shadowed areas in the same scene) and some minor stair steps of an object, but as a whole it does better than most people can do manually and with a lot less work.+ Widest angle is wide, fast and bright at an equivalent of 24mm f/2.4.+ ISO is good at 400 and good enough at 800. I also find the noise reduction to be effective and relatively pleasant but not really clean after that.+ It has Manual mode, but it's of limited value since at each zoom level you get a different set of two apertures to choose from stopped down or wide open. It's most useful when you don't want the exposure to shift brighter or darker from shot to shot.+ Macro mode is quite good, although the best results come from shooting at 24mm which means you need to get VERY close to your subject.+ It's very compact and it has a scroll wheel which makes reviewing pictures a breeze.+ Superior Auto Mode is actually pretty good, it detects back lit scenes and if the flash is off does a very respectable HDR and as soon as the focus distance gets really short it switches to macro mode... Making up for the time consuming switching that would come from having to switch scene modes yourself.+ It take SD cards in addition to Memory Sticks. I'm glad that the Cybershots are less proprietary than before.TOP Cons:- Number 1 CON is the charging/transfer cable is proprietary so you can't lose it and expect to find a replacement quickly which is too bad... so get a spare cable or a plugin battery charger with a USB card reader.- When you switch modes/scenes it tells you what it does, but it stays on the screen way too long so you can't get back to shooting fast enough (that's why I think the Superior Auto is the best mode to stay in).- No RAW mode, not that it would get you that much more since the chip on this produces great JPEGs.TOP Overrated Gimmicks:o The 10fps burst mode. It may be useful if know exactly when a burst will be needed, but you get one shot to shoot off 10 frames and then have wait for the camera to recover before shooting off the next shot.o Blink and Smile shutters... It may be okay for a tripod mounted timed group shot, but if it's on while you're holding it... nothing is more frustrating than a camera that waits to take a photo.Tips:* For most cases you can't miss if you disable the flash, use the Superior Auto mode and don't zoom in. This will take great photos outdoors, indoors at night, as well as close ups if you're willing to move in closer.* The zoom is great to have outside during the day, but for all other times you'll get better results if you just get closer with your feet and take advantage of this lens' great f/2.4 aperture.Alternatives:For the price I don't think you can do better for general purpose photos than this camera (or any preceding Cybershot W series camera for that matter). If you have some extra cash and need a LOT more zoom consider the new Canon SX40IS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch Vari-Angle Wide LCD, it's the only camera line that I've seen that is equally at home taking landscapes and closeup shots of the moon... the biggest trade-off is that it's much bulkier. If you're looking for RAW and a compact design the Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) is a good pick, but it costs much more for a little gain (and a loss in zoom range) and it may be more intimidating to the beginner. If you want truly high image quality however you need to get a larger sensor than any of these point and shoots can offer... Fortunately Sony, Olympus and Panasonic are now giving us small(er) cameras that have these larger sensors... So if you want real de-focused backgrounds consider something like the Sony Alpha NEX-C3 16 MP Compact Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera Kit with 16mm F2.8 Wide Angle Lens (Black), the trade-off here is that it is bigger and you'll want to spend more money on lenses down the road (like the Sony Alpha SEL18200 E-mount 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 OSS Lens (Silver) for go anywhere zooming in addition to your compact low-light friendly kit lens).", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "My first Cyber-Shot and I am very impressed", "Author": "John Smith", "ReviewID": "R206SGUUH1IVRZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great point-n-shoot camera. I'm not a professional photographer but I do shoot nature with my Canon dSLR. I mostly like this camera and its bevy of features. Given its small size, its features are truly jaw-dropping. I am very impressed by the iSweep Panorama, the Superior Auto and the face and smile detection features.There are minor issues with the camera (as you'll see below) but when I look at its small size, the list of \"I love...\" outweighs the list of \"I hate...\" about this camera.Pros:+ Extremely fast shutter speed for point-and-shoot camera+ For a point-and-shoot camera, I was very impressed to see how quickly it takes photographs as soon as I pressed the shutter release button.+ The best face-detection and focus tracking I have seen in a point-and-shoot camera.+ Internal built-in memory won't waste a photo or two if you forget to insert an SD card before you start shooting.+ The Superior Auto mode takes tack-sharp pictures with a great dynamic range.+ The iSweep Panorama makes it the easiest that I have seen any camera handle panoramas. All you have to do is move the composition across the panorama you're trying to shoot and the camera takes care of the rest. It produces beautiful panorama pictures that previously would have only been achieved by post-processing using some software.+ Battery life is great. I also like the fact that I don't have to take the battery out to charge it.+ It provides a lot of manual exposure controls (including ISO, aperture and shutter speed) for those who want to get creative.+ The wide F2.4 aperture gives you incredible options for low-light shooting as well as some great depth of field (the blurring of background).Cons:- Uses Sony's proprietary USB port that looks like a micro-USB port but is slightly wider than micro-USB. I don't understand why Sony wants to run away from standards. Now I have to carry one extra USB cable. All of my other devices use micro-USB (or Mini-USB).- Not ergonomic. I know small is good but size does matter. It's too small to hold.- When zooming in or out while recording videos, I could not figure out a way to avoid the noise created by the zooming lens.- Does not capture in RAW format. Only supports JPEG. Since it allows manual control, it would have been great to have the capability to record images in RAW format for better post-processing.- White balance can be very inaccurate in the auto modes. It would have been nice to still have some white balance controls in auto modes.- iSweep Panorama does not allow zoomed-in shooting. Don't take me wrong, I love iSweep Panorama but it would have been great if the camera allowed that I shoot at a zoomed-in composition.  As soon as you switch to iSweep Panorama, the camera zooms all the way out and would not let you zoom in as long as you're in this mode.- Because of its small size, many people will want to put this into their pockets or purses. I have noticed that the display can be turned on when the Play button is pressed even when the camera is powered off. This can drain battery if the camera accidentally powered on while in your pocket or purse. I wish there was some key lock feature to prevent this.Conclusion: If you want a pocket-sized point-n-shoot camera, this one is definitely worth checking out. I also suggest checking out all of the five newest Cyber-Shot 16.2MP cameras in this family that Sony released to see which one fits your needs. All five have very similar features when it comes to in-camera functions and processing but have different body and other added features such as GPS.

I studied features, and read about every review I could find. I feel like my efforts paid off! I just got this camera today. It was easy to charge, & I did that first (It took a little over two hours,) I just unplugged it, and started playing with it about 15 minutes ago. I'm so excited I could do cartwheels!First of all, I haven't read the little manual that comes with it, and I haven't put the disc in my computer yet. I'm more of a 'figure it out as I go & consult the manual as needed' kind of gal. So far this little camera is extremely intuitive and user friendly. When you turn it on, it prompts you to enter a few things such as language, time zone, screen display colors, etc. Those things all went very smooth. I chose white screen background with black lettering and find it is very easy on my eyes. And the special anti-reflective coating and clear screen display are wonderful! I can easily see it in bright sunlight and do not miss having a viewfinder at all. The dials on the back are quite a bit smaller than my old camera, but I did not have any trouble adapting to them. The dials are scored/serrated on the edges and that makes it very easy to turn them. I have only taken a few photos, but I am immensely pleased with all of them.I am especially impressed with the sweep panorama mode. I live in beautiful Western Montana where I enjoy taking tons of scenic panos. Always before I used stitching software to put the individual photos together. Oftentimes I would stitch manually because I was not satisfied with my software's automatic stitching mode.Realtors and other pano fans will know what I'm talking about. Well, I took a few quick panos of the view off my front deck and I am blown away at the result. How can this little tiny camera DO That? The panos turned out as well or better than any I've ever taken & stitched myself.And now for indoor photos. WOW! The wide angle lens let me get my entire living room and most of my kitchen in one shot. It is midday, and I have lots of windows on my left. Rather than play around with settings, I just put it on auto mode, and the lighting turned out perfect! If I was still in real estate, I would be telling my entire office to get this camera. Between the pano feature and the excellent indoor photos, it's a real gem. And the zoom...I took photos of some whitetail deer on my property. I zoomed in so the whole deer filled the frame. I was skeptical, because that much of a zoom on my old digital would have produced definite graininess. The deer photos turned out beautfully! Clear, sharp, photos with beautiful color and not a bit of grain!I have a memory stick card on order, but this camera also takes the SD card. So I have been using the one from my old camera and it works great.Oh, one more thing....Although I did not find that charging the battery while in the camera was a negative, based on other reviews I did go ahead and order a separate stand-alone battery charger w/extra battery. Just in case I want that convenience in the future. And after using the camera, I can say that it is well worth the price, even without having the separate charger included!All in all I am extremely pleased with this camera. I am looking forward to exploring more of the features!", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome on auto, but beware of strange video focus issues", "Author": "maxmasa31 \"maxmasa31\"", "ReviewID": "RPTXDA1YJIMR8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll preface this by mentioning that I'm a photography enthusiast and I usually use a system camera (an Olympus PEN) or at least a model with more manual controls (Panasonic LX5/Canon S90), so I'm a little biased in my idea of how a camera should operate, what features it should have, and how closely I look at photos.  That in mind, this camera is not meant for a someone like me or someone looking to move up to more advanced photography techniques.  I wouldn't have purchased it for myself, so I'm not going to review it like it's something I bought with my own money.  I'm reviewing it as someone who would have done the research and purchased one; someone looking for a take-anywhere camera that requires little fiddling, leaves it in full-auto.  With that in mind, the WX10 succeeds.Here's what I liked about the camera:-Fast response time and burst speed-Easy to use-Built-in help system-Long zoom (7x) for camera size-Bright f2.4 lens-Wide 24mm (35mm equiv.) lens-Great bracketing modes (white balance, auto HDR, multi-exposure)-Sweep panoramaReally, this camera is snappy.  I felt like camera focused very quickly and the 10 shots-per-second burst felt impressive, particularly when compared to the 2.5 fps of my Panasonic LX5.  Even when the camera had to process multiple shots to create HDR, low-light, or \"soft focus\" images, I was ready to take another photo in less than two seconds.  The fact that I could pull off these bracketed shots handheld was a pleasant surprise and is sure to save a lot of otherwise lost moments.The sweep panorama mode and the HD video from this camera are also very nice for a camera this size.  The anti-shake works well and when coupled with the 1080i video with stereo sound the WX10 can shoot, I really don't see why anyone would spring for a Flip-type video camera.The photo scene modes are also great, including an interesting \"Background defocus\" setting, that basically takes two photos and overlays them to create the illusion of depth.  I found it fun, and you can even select a skin softening filter which produces pleasing portraits.  The stitching isn't perfect, and edges can get messed up, particularly in complex images, but it is a neat parlour trick that only larger-sensored dSLR cameras can take, and I had fun with it.I also liked that, even though the camera is already very user-friendly, it has a built-in help menu that will walk users through the different functions of the camera and explain things like what the on-screen icons mean.  It's a nice touch that allows people new to digital photography to use the camera without needing the instruction booklet.  A great feature for an older person or a new camera user.Something I liked, however, that may bother others, is the fact that the battery charges in-camera, which means you have to plug the camera in using a USB cable.  This is personal preference, but I like it, because when I travel, I already have a USB charger for my iPod or 3DS or any number of gadgets I haul, so it's one less charger to have to pack.  On the other hand, if you're not like me, it means one extra thing to worry about losing, and I think the cable is proprietary, meaning if you lose it, forget about charging your camera.  Still, the USB cable method is handy if you're using your laptop (it can charge while you're connected) or if you already have a USB charger you use for other devices.But the big point where the WX10 shines is in low-light photography.  Because it can take so many photos so quickly, in low-light mode, it takes multiple photos and stitches them together (like in HDR photos) to produce dynamic, low-noise images.  Now, I don't like how heavy handed Sony is with their noise-reduction (see my cons below), and their low ISO photos are awful in that regard, but once the ISOs go over 800, this HDR-style method produces results that rival (if not exceed) my more expensive point-and-shoot cameras.  Very impressive and great for indoors or nighttime shots.Now, on to what I didn't like:First and foremost, (and perhaps there's a setting to disable it that I couldn't find) the camera is constantly in auto-focus-tracking mode while shooting video.  This is probably fine in certain situations, but let's say you're slowly panning across an open field, shooting something in the distance.  Once you pan across a tree five feet from you, the camera's focus will automatically shift to it, ruining your shot.  I also noticed that, when I slowly panned across my afternoon-lit living room, the video had this strange, almost-pulsing effect as the camera shifted in and out of focus, depending on the how close the various objects were.  I did this several times, thinking it was fluke, but I managed to reproduce the problem each time.  It's very distracting and I tried looking in the menus and setting the camera to dedicated video mode, but nothing I could find would allow me to manually focus or focus-lock while shooting video.  Disappointing, considering the quality video this camera is capable of producing.  I haven't shot a lot of video, so I don't know how pronounced a problem this may be, but from my few test videos, it's worth mentioning.Another thing I didn't like about the WX10 was its general image quality, though this is probably personal preference/bias.  I know I complimented it just a few paragraphs ago, and for the average user, you'll get some beautiful 4x6\" prints from this camera.  Maybe even some nice 8x10s.  But while this camera can capture 16MP images, print anything larger than an 8x10 and you'll notice the loss of detail, even at the base ISO100.  Basically, Sony is still too heavy-handed with their noise reduction engine and fine detail is smeared.  There are settings to increase sharpness, but that's only available in Program or Manual mode and all it looks like it does is add an unsharp mask filter to it, resulting in jagged, muddy edges instead of just muddy edges.Of course, most people will only print up to 8x10 and unless you're comparing 100% crops against another camera, average users won't notice the difference, and I thought the color reproduction was quite nice.  My LX5 shoots a little cold (bluish), but the Sony seemed warmer and a little more to my liking.Another issue I had was with the lack of a macro focus setting.  There's manual focus (in program or manual mode) and the camera can auto focus to macro, but it's unusual to not have it (even the cheap Canons have them) and the camera doesn't always focus on what I'd like, so trying to focus on something close can be a little more tedious without the macro focus option.Finally, and this is not really a problem, but I'd also like to see more creative modes.  Yes, the WX10 has B&W;, sepia, background defocus, and other scene-specific settings, but I'd like to see fun things like a toy camera or pinhole filters that some other camera brands have.  This model is perfect for those types of things, and it's something I was hoping it would have.  Again, not a problem, but more of a wish list for future models.Still, most of my problems are nit picks from having used more complex cameras in a higher price bracket.  I'll admit that having used numerous Sony cameras in the past and greatly disliking all of them, I came into using this camera very skeptical, but walked away pleasantly surprised.  This is a handsome camera (Sony cameras always are) with a great feature set, and if you're in the market for a high-quality, ultra-pocketable camera that can produce good images and HD video with little-to-no effort, the WX10 is a great choice.  For most people, I'd say this is a four-star camera, with a single star reduction because of the weird focusing issues while recording video.**Update** - A helpful person pointed out that the WX10 CAN zoom while shooting video, so I've removed that portion of my review.  When I first tried, however, it didn't work, hence my mentioning it.  It did work when I tried it again, though, so I'll also try to reproduce this problem (like I did with the focusing) and will update if it happens again.

Although camera is not super thin, its extremely light!-Takes great night shots for sports events. Very clear ( use it all the time for ryans evening softball)- Screen is a great size and very clear to review pictures.- Very good Panorama(360) settingCons:- Power button is very sensitive and turns on easily...in turn the battery dies without you knowing. A case for the camera is a must!- When taking a video there is a large delay between pressing the button and it actually recording.- Plastic, lacks build quality(Yet almost a year later, it is still kicking) Neutral:-LOTS of different options for taking pictures, but I feel like most of them are the same. \"soft face\" is my favorite for close ups. Background:My sister breaks cameras, phones, anything with a battery all the time.  She needed a camera and this was a perfect type of camera to get for her (Even at the normal price point)  It has been almost a year and the camera still works great!  When i first got it, the build quality seems very flimsy and I am surprised it is still working perfectly after a year given all of my sister's past history of breaking things.  Myself, I am an avid photographer who owns multiple DLSR's and my choice of camera for point and shoots are the high end Canon S90,95,100 due to their sensor size and build quality.  This sony doesn't quite match up to the Canon S90's which is expected especially since it goes for almost twice as much.  So I am reviewing this as a camera for a normal consumer who wants a solid digital camera that JUST WORKS as well as working well with satisifying quality.Overall:Camera takes great pictures and I think is perfect for ANYONE who needs a digital camera for normal use.  Mom, dad, sister, etc.  It fits the perfect niche of a camera that wont break after a year, takes great pictures, good price point, easy to use and does the video and still photography.

Sometimes you don't know if you've even pressed it because of how it's slightly recessed. Also, as soon as you DO press it, you're not sure if it's recording because it takes about 3 seconds to indicate if it is. Conversely, when you press it again to stop recording it takes a couple of seconds to confirm. To be completely sure, you have to leave the beep effects on. The record button will beep on / off when you leave it on, otherwise it's quiet.It takes fairly good photos. I noticed that when shooting in Superior Auto mode sometimes the color can be too darkened when shooting indoors (without flash). It takes fantastic black & white photos.I would improve the shutter release button. It's a cheap, round plastic button but it works. I would have preferred a metal button, just to feel a little sturdier.The sweep panoramic shots are really good, especially with outdoor / landscapes. I LOVE this feature.

In order to charge on the wall outlet (wall socket) one needs 3 items: the wall adapter, the usb cable and the camera (with the battery inside).

I wish it was as big as their Xperia phones so that the buttons, dials, and battery could be larger.Some people complained slow menu, slow video start, unintuitive settings. I find otherwise, and this is my first sony camera. The different auto modes are not confusing, and there is not much delay for the supper auto mode. Startup is fast too.Auto focus is fast, even in low light condition. I found it easier to capture good pictures for my kids with this camera than with my DSLR. This is a truly point and shot.Image quality is OK. It is not much worse and not much better than the others. There are samples photos on pbase for all kinds of cameras. I find the compacts are more or less on the same level. The much raved Canon S100, S95, Nikon S8200 don't seem to possess a clear edge over the Sony's. A sturdier hand and a gentle press make all the difference. Frankly, if you are used to DSLR and prime lens, all of the compacts are a little disappointing. Many years ago, I had a Canon S200. Looking at the sample pictures on pbase from the compacts, I don't even think image quality has improved much for the compacts over the decade, except for resolution.I have also noticed the camera's LCD makes the pictures look vivid but unreal. On a computer screen, the pictures look more realistic. The pictures look the best on a flat panel TV. I haven't printed any yet, but I guess the prints will look similar to the pictures on a flat TV.Bottom line is, if you are looking for image quality and not particular about compact size, your best choice is micro 4/3 with pancake lens or things like Fuji X100 or X10.

My short list from web research was (in order of preference) Nikon S9100 (18X zoom! Great price on Amazon!), Canon SX230HS (14X zoom and rave pic qualty reviews!), Sony HX9V (16X zoom and 16MP sensor!).  Then I walked into my local camera shop (yes, a real camera shop, not a Big Box chain).  I wound up walking out with the WX10 (16 MP and, well, 7X zoom).  Why?  Well, the sales guy (a friend from past dealings) was very enthusiastic (translation: he sold me).  Bought it mainly for stills.  Video just a side benefit for now, for me.  Some quick pro's and con's:Pro's:*This thing is tiny-- about the size of a thin deck of cards.  Smaller than my Blackberry.  Slides in and out of a pants/shirt/jacket pocket like butter.*Sturdy-- Metal front and plastic back.  The metal front gives it a nice rigid construct.  The second day out, it slipped out of my hands as I was standing in the kitchen trying to fall in love with it (Oh no!).  It flipped into the air and hit the granite counter top (as I watched in slo-mo horror), then clunked onto the wood floor, where it came to rest, narrowly missing plopping into the dog's water bowl.  I thought, oh great.  It's broke.  It's banged up.  It's toast.  But nothing.  I mean nothing wrong.  Not a scratch/dent/crack anywhere.  Everything still worked like brand new.  I owned a Minolta Dimage Z10 years ago.  Knocked it off the counter at a job site once, and that was it.  Chunks of plastic flew everywhere.  Not this thing.  It's a little brick.*Fast-- About 2 seconds from turn it on to shoot.  Auto focus lightning fast.  You can't turn off the pic review, so about 2 sec from pic to pic, but you can enable 10 or 2 fps burst mode-- impressive.  Love the rat-atat-tat machine gun sound effect and fast capture.  Hate the 5 second processing time to write the exposures to the card.*Smart-- I can put it \"intelligent auto\" or \"intelligent auto plus\" mode, and it seems to get it right all the time.  Not just sometimes-- all the time.  This is exactly what I wanted from a P&S.;  I don't want to fuss with the buttons/menus/dials.  I just want to pull it out, shoot, and put it away, confident that the camera is smart enough to handle most scenes without my intervention.  And it does that in scary-smart fashion.  I haven't done any testing/comparisons with my A55 yet, but I FEEL like the WX10 is better at it.  In IA+, the WX10 selects a scene mode if it needs to, rat-atat's off 4 or 5 exposures if it needs to, and figures out HDR, backlight, portrait, moving subject (the list goes on), and sets shutter speed, aperture, ISO, and HDR functions as appropriate.  And the results that I have seen are awesome.  Did I say it just gets it right?*Easy to operate-- I can pull this out of a pocket or belt case with one hand and easily operate it with the same hand.  Perfect for grabbing the moment, even while driving!  Oops, don't try this at home.  I have been toying with the idea of shooting urban landscapes just for something to do (my sparkling life!).  But the clunkiness of prepping the A55 for something like this caused me to just put it off.  Today I was cruising through downtown on my way back from a meeting, whipping out the WX10 and snapping out the window.  Effortless.*16MP, same sensor as the HX9V--  If I don't need the big zoom, I save a hundred bucks (but that 18X Nikon still calls me).*Semi-manual controls-- One thing the WX10 has over the S9100 is that it at least gives you SOME manual control.  Choice of 2 apertures, and full ISO and shutter speed control.  That's enough.  If I hate what the camera is thinking in IA or IA+, I can take over.  But I wish it had shutter/aperture priority modes.  Oh well, can't have everything in a P&S.;  And honestly, I am thinking the WX10 may be smart enough to eliminate the need for these modes.  Time will tell.*Sony G-series f2.4 glass--  I have read a little about Minolta/Sony G-series glass.  Not sure of the exact differences between this and the glass Sony puts in any other Cyber-shot product.  But it's comforting to think that Sony thought enough of the difference to emblazon a big G on the front of the WX10.  Also, at f2.4, WX10 trumps all 3 on my short list above.  So a nice fast lens for low light, and short DOF when I need it.Cons:*Image quality-- It's not as good as the A55's 16MP pics.  But since I paid 3X as much for the A55, I guess I would be pi**ed if the WX10 could match it.  The first thing I did when I got the WX10 out of the box was shoot a few shots of the kitchen (daylight streaming thru the windows, ISO 800), then shoot the same scene with the A55 and ran over to the computer to get a look.  At first glance, (fit image to screen) the WX10 did a better job of white balance, and made a picture that stood up very well for sharpness, color, resolution.  But zoom in, and ouch.  Very noisy compared to A55.  Also softer focus.  Some of this can be cleaned up with post processing sharpness increase.  But you just can't get back the detail it loses due to noise.  As many other reviews have stated, this will not be an issue for printing 5X7's or even 8X10's.  But it gave me a sinking feeling to see it on screen.  Especially after reading the image quality reviews for the Canon SX230HS's 12MP at the same price point.  I though 16MP was a guarantee of better image quality.  Maybe not so much.Concluson:I like this little camera.  I like its size, ease of use, the pictures it makes, the way it feels, sounds, looks (and bounces!).  Any one of the 4 cameras I talked about here (Nikon S9100, Canon SX230HS, Sony HX9V, Sony WX10) will have some compromise compared to the others in terms of price, features, form factor, image quality.  The WX10 will work for me as a P&S;, and work very well.  The image quality is a bit disappointing, but it will not be an issue for me the way I intend to use the camera (I hope).  I have only run a few hundred exposures through it so far.

We have a nicer (larger) camera that is great for when we are more stationary, but this Sony is great for on the go.  We bought this camera specifically for our cruise and it took amazing pictures.  My favorite feature is the panorama option.  I have never had that on any other camera and I love the results.  Since our cruise, the camera has come to Legoland and Disney World and the pictures taken of the parks and our kids are perfect.

Bison", "ReviewID": "R3GAQHI4VOG7DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I have a fancy-pants camera with a gazillion functions I don't use.  I've also had an assortment of point and shoot cameras over the years.  I find this camera to be the best point and shoot camera I've had to-date, and has some really neat features that my other DSLR doesn't have which have been handy at various times -- like how the sensor picks up on infant faces, or the wealth of shooting modes you can setit to (if you feel so included).  I also find that this camera takea really good low-light shots -- better than most cameras I've seen (but again, I'm no expert).  My family members tend to keep it on the \"auto\" setting most of the time, and are generally really pleased with the pics.  Also, I find the video it takes to be TERRIFIC -- I mean REALLY good -- AND you can Zoom in/out while you're taking it.  Definitely a major plus.  All in all, I find this to be a great, powerfully compact point and shoot camera that delivers great pics, is relatively easy to use, has a ton of handy features packed into it, and has a great display.  Definitely a winner in my book.  The one thing I'm going to say annoys me a little is the type of interface needed to plug it in to charge / upload pics via a cord -- it's not one of the more common USB types found on many small electronic devices nowadays, which menas I have to carry around one more cord when I pack this for a trip.  Not a huge deal, but just something to be aware of.  In my opinion, still a 5-star product.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "very compact very capable", "Author": "Salih Tuncer Mutlucan", "ReviewID": "R2K5WHNZBST3B3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Despite its small size the details are pretty good.

It's a great size-small but not too small-so it can fit in your pocket. That's especially nice for times when you can't carry a lot-like a hike or something to that effect.I'm not one for reading big technical manuals, I like things that I can look at it and being able to figure it out right away and I was able to do that with this camera. I'm also not one for going into big technical terms about products in my reviews but I can tell you that it works and works well. The photos that I've taken with the camera are all in great quality. And when taking pictures and videos, the images on the screen are quite clear. The features on the camera are quite awesome as well. I love the face detection feature and the ability to take a panoramic photo. I don't have a 3D TV to take advantage of using the 3D feature but maybe down the road I'll be able to use that feature.I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "shannon", "ReviewID": "RY32UG32K7WP3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a nikon D300 and a couple of lenses.  I am a semi-professional photographer so I use the d300 for taking portraits.....but it is such a big camera that it is a real pain to lug around everywhere, so I find myself leaving it at home on family outings. I was looking for a camera that would come as close as possible to my d300, but was small enough to put in a small pocket.  I like this camera a lot.  The pictures are very sharp, the color is beautiful (good automatic white balance) the shutter speed is much better than any I have tried in the smaller models.  It has a large maximum aperature as compared with other models (I think it is 2.8 wide open).  It has a really neat panoramic option that is fun to play with.  It has a rapid fire shutter option that will take up to 10 frames per second (if I recall correctly).  It has automatic settings and some custom options too.  So far the automatic mode looks so good that I have had no desire to play around with the custom shooting menu......afterall, I'm not working when I'm using this camera, I'm just someone taking snapshots of her family.  The video seems ok.  I have not tried to view it on a large screen, so I will reserve my judgement.......Overall, everywhere I looked, this was the camera with the best reviews!!!

I take it everywhere with me, and I mean that.  I love that it fits in my pocket.  The picture and video quality are vastly superior to what I get on my Droid X cell phone, and one doesn't have to fumble through a bunch of touchscreens to get to the point of taking a picture.The panorama feature is my favorite -- it is so easy!  You just point the camera at one end, press the shutter, and move the camera as smoothly as you can (don't worry - it compensates for wobble!) through the rest of the view.  Images taken from a distance work better -- those closeup may have a \"bend\" in the middle since the focal point is so much closer to the camera -- but the quality of the interpolated image is just fabulous.Embarrassingly, I have few HD-capable playback devices.  So the HD video on the camera looks great and works well, but I can't say all that much about it except that it does look very good.  I have to admit to having no way to check out the \"3D\" feature, except, again, to say that the image looks fine on the camera display.Battery life seems excellent.The size is perfect.  I love taking it everywhere so easily.I do like the wide-angle lens!  No fish-eye feel, just more image.A few slight problems that I have run into:**The camera hasn't been \"plug and play\" with all my devices.  My Windows XP computer at work won't recognize it as a storage device, even from a USB 2.0 port.  I imagine if I installed the Sony software it would, but I'd prefer not to do that.**Some outdoor shots are completely washed out.  I think I need to play with the backlighting feature and some of the settings... I imagine it is possible to get around it, but it would be nice for a smart camera to figure it out on its own when one is moving from indoor to outdoor shots and doesn't want to have to fiddle in between.**The zoom is very 'touchy' and I sometimes have a hard time adjusting it 'just right,' especially for portrait shots.**I do have to admit that I like a 'longer' zoom, one that will allow me to capture the deer waaaaay out in the field.  I understand one can only do so much in a small package and that this much zoom would have been unthinkable 10 years ago, but I look forward to the time when we have LOTS of zoom in small packages because I am never as close as I think I am!The \"Pros\" strongly outweigh the \"Cons\" with this camera.

There is no program that comes natively with the Mac that can play them.To be sure, converters exist which will allow you to transform such files into movies that can be played on the Mac, but these are not available for free.In short, you won't be able to view your movies on a Mac without some serious tinkering around.  I guess this is more of a complaint about the Mac OS than this camera, but there you go.Note that the camera also gives you the option of record in MP4 format, but that's a format that's considered less desirable for hi-def shooting.Additional beef:  there's apparently no way to erase all the pictures on the camera in one fell swoop!

Olympus cameras, Fuji camera, another cyber shot and my recent Lumix TZ3. I really love my Lumix TZ3, but after playing with this camera I like some of the functions on the Cyber shot WX10 a bit better. The only thing on my Lumix TZ3 that is better is it has 10x optical zoom and this one only has 7x so it is kind of a downgrade there. But, the WX10 is more compact which is great.The one thing I don't really like about this one is there is no easy grip area on the camera. My Lumix TZ3 had a ledge for your hand to hold on to. The WX10 doesn't, and the back is crowded with the screen, buttons and dials so it is hard to get a comfortable grip.The manual says charges in 270 minutes, but I noticed that the first charge took around 2 hours instead. The camera is very fast to turn on most times. I find that the first time turning it on in a while it will display the cybershot logo and then turn on. But, if you turn it on again it pops on instantly. Which is nice.There are tons of great features to play around with on this one. There is some manual modes, there is face detection, smile detection, burst shots. My favorite is panorama, it is so easy to use you just press the shutter button and slowly move the camera around the room till it tells you to stop and you have a panoramic shot, fast and easy.It has 15 different scene selections, some of them are: soft skin, background defocus, soft snap, anti motion blur and backlight correction HDR. It doesn't have a self portrait scene selection, but soft skin works well for that.I like that it has the ability to display the images without even turning the camera on and the lens coming out. You just have to push the little disp. button and you can see all your pictures.I haven't played around with all the features yet, but so far I really like it. It has very crisp clean shots.
