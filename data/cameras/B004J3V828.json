{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best pocket-sized Canon yet", "Author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\"", "ReviewID": "R1AI4ZRJL3ZPEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BOTTOM LINE:With each generation, Canon makes the ELPH series easier to use and still get great results.  Like it's predecessors, this one fits easily into your pocket (or the case I recommend toward the end of this review).  That point alone may make this the best camera you own; having a $5k DSLR doesn't do you much good if you left it home because it wasn't worth the effort to lug it along.However, unlike many other small cameras, this one does not sacrifice either features or quality.  Well, it does give up on any reasonable manual control, things like setting shutter speed, lens aperture, ISO.  What access you do have to that level of control is buried deep inside menus.  It took Canon a while to realize that for most of us, if we wanted to fool with that kind of thing on a regular basis, we would be using a different camera.  This camera is designed to leverage convenience over extreme control or nth degree quality.DETAILS:It is a small camera and carries with it the baggage that comes with the convenience of having to carry so little baggage.  (sorry, couldn't resist) None of the issues raised, given that they comes as part of the convenience trade-off made me consider anything other than the 5-star rating this camera deserves.One issue with all small cameras is the built-in flash.  They are all underpowered and create red eye.  Both problems are caused by the need to keep the camera small; the flash needs to be small and positioned close to the lens.  Canon addresses it by putting in some really good noise reduction so you (actually the camera) can shoot at a relatively high ISO in low light allowing for a faster shutter speed.  The result is an image that is both low noise and not blurry.  And the best part is the camera takes care of all that so you don't have to. As a result you can take pictures in a well lit room without having to use the flash at all.-  The shutter response, as with any small digital camera for less that $500, is a bit slow for effectively capturing children and pets.  The trick for doing that is to either have a great sense of timing and a shutter that reacts instantly or a reasonably fast ( > 4x / sec ) burst mode.  This camera has neither.Some other suggestions that apply:Normally at this point I would put in some details about manually setting ISO or selecting a color space.  However, for this camera it just isn't relevant.  You are buying this camera because you want to take great pictures without having to worry about that stuff.  If you do want to \"take your photography to the next level then a great resource is the Confessions of a Compact Camera Shooter: Get Professional Quality Photos with Your Compact Camera.Finally, I've found the Caselogic QPB-1 Compact Digital Camera Case (Black/Gray) is just the right size for this camera.  It's semi-rigid so you get a fair amount of protection but doesn't add a lot of bulk.  It's made even better by using one of these, Nite Ize SB1-2PK-01 Size-1 S-Biner, Black, 2-Pack, to secure it to a belt loop.Update: Since posting the review about a year and a half ago the camera case I mentioned was replaced by the Case Logic TBC-301 Ultra Compact Camera Case (Black).  I've tried it and the camera fits perfectly.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon ELPH 100 HS -- U R going to luv it", "Author": "george bancks", "ReviewID": "R3SCZ7Z690EMC0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received my Canon ELPH 100 HS {orange} and I absolutely love it. The camera boots up almost instantly. Installed a 16GB SDHC class 10 card and now have 5000+ 12MB photo capacity or 60 minutes for HD video. The image stabilization at max digital zoom 4X4/16x works great! The camera easily fits in my pocket and is very light @ ~5 ounces.The Canon's Digic 4 processor & CMOS sensor make this camera truly point and shoot. By default it automatically selects the light level, shaking, target focus, shutter speed, flash/noflash and ISO to pick the optimal scene type. Perfect pictures virtually every time when button is correctly pressed 1/2 way (1) before fully in (2) for photo shot. But be sure to get a class 10 card for the best video.The only 2 minor problems I believe are:1) It comes with a 700 mAh 3.7 Volt battery instead of the 1400 mAh 3.7 OEM version which doubles it run-time for 230 photos to almost 500 pictures per charge. This is easily fixed when ordering additional batteries just get the larger mAh capacity ones.2) The CameraWindow transfer software doesn't automatically delete pictures after they are transferred. Some people like this as not to delete photos improperly transferred.(I do not). Some camera blogs suggest a quick format after transfer is the way to quickly delete photos/video after successful transfer.However, this is the best point and shoot camera I have used and I still think it's a 5 star camera @ $199 MSRP.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good but no Video zoom - Get the 300 HS", "Author": "Tuan Thach", "ReviewID": "R2G9NYU0YFCW9N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product description for the Canon 100 HS and the 300 HS are very similar and it appears to be mostly just the wide angle and zoom.

Schmidt", "ReviewID": "R3JCTSIPQG0P0A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "NOTE: see update at end or reviewI have a bunch of digital cameras, from older-and-low-resolution-but-still-useful to newer and fancy. Most but not all have been from Canon, since in my evaluations they have the best all around combination of quality company, support, features, build quality, price, user interface, etc. In the middle of my has been my trusty Canon PowerShot A510, a camera I bought years ago for the sole purpose of quickly shooting images from projected slides (a project to create a quick catalog of slides I had stored in carousels). But over the years the old A510 has been starting to get a bit long in the tooth, although it still takes good everyday pictures and remains reliable enough.I decided it was time to replace the A510 because I need to manually fiddle with the automatic lens cover mechanism, almost every time I turn the camera on, to get it to open fully.I did not want to sped a lot of money, but I wanted something with a similar level of utility to the A510. After a lot of evaluating, I settled on the Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS. Like the A510, it has similar optics, and the zoom is also an optical 4X. The size in the hand is almost identical, although the new one is about half as thick.One thing I always thought Canon did very well with their digital cameras is the user interface. And that interface was pretty consistent across their lineup, so that most functions were done the same way on all my Canons, using the same or at least very similar buttons and controls. The new ELPH 100 dispenses with the older tradition, and does some things differently.On the older system there was a thumb operated knob on top for selecting AUTO plus several common modes such as Portrait, Landscape, Night, Sports/Action, Panorama, and a few variations of Manual mode. The new system replaces the knob with a two position selector on top which is essentially AUTO and ALL ELSE. When in AUTO, the camera evaluates the composition of your picture and decides which mode to use automatically. When in ALL ELSE, the LCD screen presents those other modes for your manual selection using the Up/Down/Left/Right navigation control on the back of the camera. This is slightly more difficult than using the knob, but not too much more so.An improvement over the older system is that the Movie button is a separate control, so you can start shooting your movie immediately by pressing the button, instead of needing to turn the knob of navigate through a menu. Unlike some of the bigger Canon cameras, the ELPH 100 does not allow simultaneous movie and still photo shooting. But if you are shooting a movie and press the shutter button twice, the first press cancels the movie and the second press takes the still photo. You could then press the movie button again and resume shooting the movie with only a couple seconds lost. Also, the ELPH 100 does not allow changes to exposure after the move shoot has started, although it does allow zoom and auto focus changes during the shoot.In AUTO, the ELPH 100 automatically goes into macro mode when you get close to an object. In ALL ELSE, you can select several options in this regard.The ELPH 100 uses the red/orange lamp on the front as a surrogate flash bulb for red-eye reduction, as opposed to firing an early flash to close down the subject person's pupils. The lamp is very bright in this case, but at other times is is less bright for other indications such as timer mode count down.The ELPH has several combinations of photo quality/resolution, and allows you to select between four movie quality settings; two are widescreen HD, and two are stand aspect ratio video. The various ALL ELSE modes that apply to still photos can also be applied to movies.As will all Canons, the still photo trigger control (shutter release) is both a button AND a rotating, spring return to center zoom control. Using the zoom while in picture taking mode will zoom optically first, then will adjust digital zoom if held for a longer time. Using the zoom while in picture viewing (playback) mode will allow close inspection of pictures you already took (use the navigation control pad to pan around inside the zoomed in view), and will also turn the LCD viewfinder into a photo gallery of taken pictures and movies, allowing for quickly jumping around in your collection.Another departure from some older models is that there is no longer a clear-cut selector switch for choosing picture taking mode versus picture viewing mode. Instead, there is a button that puts the camera into viewing mode, and pressing the shutter release trigger button puts it back into picture taking mode.The ELPH 100 comes with a video cable that has both HDMI and standard PCD audio and composite video connectors for connecting to your TV. It also comes with a USB cable, although the camera manual does not indicate that the battery can be charged via USB; it only mentions charging by way of the included AC wall charger that the battery fits into (i.e. you must remove the battery from the camera).The ELPH 100 takes standard SD memory cards as well as SDHC and SDXC and MultiMedia cards, MMC-Plus cards, and Eye-Fi cards (the latter is not guaranteed to work). NOTE: the ELPH 100 does NOT come with a memory card, and you cannot use the camera without the card. In the old days, digital cameras came with a small memory cord just so you could at least play around with it before buying a larger card, but this is no longer true. The camera is often bundled with a memory card by the retailer, just keep your eyes open when buying.A big departure from the older A510 and its relatives is the use of a proprietary rechargeable battery as opposed to standard AA batteries. I really liked being able to travel with a couple sets of AA's and a wall charger, and be able to use those charged batteries in any of the cameras I had according to need. With the new camera I will be locked into the special battery. It is easy to get this camera bundled (by Amazon and by stores) with a second battery, so at least I can have a charged spare on hand. The newer batteries DO allow for a thinner and lighter weight camera, and the Lithium-Ion technology charges very quickly and lasts a long time.I will not go into specifics of 'how good are the pictures'. The pictures are very good, and you can make them even better by going into manual mode(s). At the price range of the ELPH 100, the photo quality is at least competitive with other brands and models.UPDATE: (July 2012)After using this camera for a longer period, I have more observations:- The camera has a slick, low friction surface. It also has no bumps or other protruding things to help you get a grip on it. Trying to shoot one-handed, I have dropped the camera many times. It really needs to be held two-handed to avoid drops.- While the camera has not taken any out-of-focus still photos that I can recall, it HAS taken many out-of-focus videos. They are not greatly out of focus, not enough so that you can tell there is a problem in the viewfinder LCD screen, just out of focus enough that you swear loudly when viewing them later at home. I find it useful to, while keeping composition unchanged, to half-press the trigger button before pressing the video start button. I think this is a flaw in the design of the camera.- Needing to go into two menu layers deep to select all of the non-auto shooting modes is a real pain. I wish Canon would go back to a thumb wheel for selecting these modes.- While there is a tiny speaker on the camera for playing back audio from videos you shoot, the volume is so soft that it is hard to hear anything. My other Canon cameras that are capable of shooting videos had much better speaker volume. I don't see any place in the menus to change the speaker volume.-Beware of batteries from other companies besides Canon. I have tried some, and even with the same ratings, they seem to actually last for much less time than the Canon one.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Everything I wanted and more", "Author": "supersonicsixteen", "ReviewID": "R3D6C138GTM5PF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is exactly what I was looking for.  I had previously had an older model (by a year or two) and was pleased with it, and hoped that nothing significant was changed that would decrease the quality.  Well I was really pleased when this came in the mail.  The new features of Super Slow Motion, and Recording in full 1080p are absolutely incredible.Other modes of shooting includeAuto- This mode is just what it says, and it has some pretty great versatilityProgram- In this mode you can choose what colors you want to emphasize, as well as what lighting you're using, or continuous shutter modeMovie digest-Takes a clip with each shot to make a day's summary(I've never really used it, this is just the description that the camera gives)Portrait- Good for people shotsKids and pets- Good for faster moving objectsSmart Shutter-  Okay this one is way freakin' cool.  The camera apparently \"knows\" when you're smiling, and in this mode it'll just take pictures on it's own if it sees anyone smiling.  It's half freaky, half freakin' awesomeHigh Speed Burst- This is for those moments when you only have a moment, and you want to catch someone in the air, or something else really crazy like that, where there isn't much time.  Basically you hold down the button, and it keeps taking pictures in ultra quick succession.  I've used it a bunch to get those sweet mid-air shots.Best image selection- This mode takes three pictures at once, and chooses the \"best quality one\"  I'm not sure how it does that, but it does.handheld night scene- I haven't used this, but it's kinda self descriptivelowlight- It cuts back on MP, and gets a good clear shot.  This is actually one of the fortes of Cannon Cameras is great photos in low light.  I can attest.Fish-eye effect- I guess if you're a skater it's cool right?  It's also adjustable so that all of the shots don't look the same.miniature effect-  This one was totally new to me, and rather fun.  Basically it makes anything you take a picture of look like a tiny toy, or just plain tiny.  It was waaay to much fun to use.Toy camera effect- It darkens the edges to \"Create a distinctive feel\" LOL.monochrome- Cool word for black and whiteSuper vivid- Just thatposter effect- It gives photos that \"poster effect\"  I'm not sure how to relate this.  You'll have to find out when you pick up the camera.  It does look cool though.Color Accent- It gives you the ability to highlight one color, and the rest of the photo is in black and white.  This is possibly my favorite modeColor Swap- you select two colors, and one color is replaced by the other.  This mode can get kinda trippy sometimes, but it pretty entertaining.  I'll also add that when you're selecting a color, you're actually choosing the color out of the real world, so there isn't a stupid menu you have to choose from or something.  You choose what's actually there.Beach-Pictures with lotsa sunlightunderwater- I haven't tried this one, mostly because... I don't want to mess up my camera.  You can get an underwater case for this model.  There are actually two different types.  One is 50ish, and another is actually the very price of the camera to begin with... a little too much for me, but apparently great for scuba diving...Foliage- Get those green shotssnow-Totally useless in Texas where I'm at, but Pretty good when I was in RussiaFireworks- It really works the best for fireworks.  Go figure.Long Shutter- This is for night stuff where you want the shutter to take in more light.Stitch Assist- This is supposed to help with the creating of panorama shots, but it doesn't actually mend them together, so I found it a little useless. You can also start from either sideWhew... That was a long list.  I must mention that you can take video from EVERY MODE.  This is ultra cool in monochrome, color accent, or color swap.Basically take my advice.  Buy the Camera.  I did loads of research myself (which of course I encourage you to do), and if you want super photos, but perhaps aren't a photographer, then go for this.  If you are a photographer then I would say that it handles esp. well.  Go for it!Also I'm updating this review, because my Camera lens got jammed.  So I went and shipped it to the cannon repair center, and I had a brand new one in 4 days flat.  I had heard of it taking upwards of 2 weeks.  Not so with me.  Also when I sent it back to be repaired I took the battery, and sd card out.  When they shipped a new one, it came with a brand new battery.  Talk about awesome.

Kato \"MK\"", "ReviewID": "RQ9AALQC05UD0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have the Canon PowerShot A80, A620, and SD800 IS.  The photos from the SD800 IS are not as clean as the photos of the older A-model Canons with slightly larger sensors and lower megapixels, but the photos are reasonably sharp and the SD800 IS is more compact than my older A models for everyday carry.  However, small cameras with small flashes with limited flash range would benefit from better low-light-higher-ISO capabilities -- my SD800 IS takes photos at ISO 1600 that look quite grainy or noisy.  So I decided to check out the Canon HS models for the low-light-high-ISO capabilities.  I wanted an HS model that was smaller than my SD800 and I did not want to pay too much for a camera that I was not completely sure about, so I put the cheapest ELPH 100 HS model in my Amazon.com cart.  When the price dropped by $20 and Super Saver Shipping was offered, I ordered the 100 HS in April and have been carrying the camera as my everyday camera and using it for nine weeks.The 100 HS is lighter and much thinner than my SD800, although it is actually a little longer.  The screen is much bigger and takes up most of the back of the camera -- it is great for reviewing photos.  But the control wheel is smaller and is a little trickier to use -- I kept pressing the wrong way and needed additional attempts to get things changed.  With fewer external controls on the back than the SD800, the 100 HS required more use of the menus.  The smaller size of the 100 HS is an important attraction for me, but it comes with some disadvantages -- there is little to grab onto, so I use the wrist strap to help in avoiding drops.In low light, the higher ISO capabilities of the 100 HS have been impressive.  The photos look really less grainy or noisy and the colors have looked pretty good.  However, zooming in on the photos reveal soft images and lack of detail, so the noise reduction results in loss of sharpness.  Photos taken with the flash within the limited flash range and lower ISO are noticeably sharper than the photos taken without the flash and higher ISO.  Although I used to see reviews that said that ELPH cameras produced photos that were very sharp, the reviews on the 100 HS indicate that its resolution is a bit low and is average at best, not sharp, so the high ISO noise reduction appears to be only part of the reason why the photos look so soft.  My SD800 IS, which is not the sharpest camera out there, produces sharper looking photos than the 100 HS.When I decided to use the 100 HS's flash more from within the flash's range in order to get sharper photos, I encountered another problem -- the flash photos showed a color cast and were less pleasing than the photos taken without the flash.  This was surprising to me, because I have not gotten this result with any of my other Canon cameras -- so I had to do some color correction with Adobe Photoshop Elements.  After getting that screwy flash color result, I compared the colors of photos taken under different lighting conditions taken with the 100 HS and the SD800.  The SD800 produced photos with more accurate colors than the 100 HS.  However, the difference is only noticeable if you compare the photos taken with the 100 HS against photos taken of the same objects with other cameras or if you compare the photos with the original objects photographed, so the 100 HS's colors may be satisfactory to you, especially if you use the \"Vivid\" or other color setting.Because I usually print photos in the 4X6-inch size, I set the aspect ratio at 3:2 instead of 4:3.  When I changed the aspect ratio, I lost the digital zoom.  I learned from Canon that the digital zoom works only in the 4:3 aspect ratio.  As others have already pointed out, the optical zoom of the 100 HS is not available for video, so any zooming has to be with the digital zoom.  If you set the 100 HS for the aspect ratio 3:2 or 16:9 and you plan to zoom during a video with the digital zoom, you should set the aspect ratio to 4:3 before starting the video.After reading more comments and reviews, I concluded that there is a price paid for the compactness and low-light capabilities of this camera.  Other cameras that are a bit bigger may be better suited for those who are looking for a primary camera.  For family and office events, I have my other Canons and my Nikon D90 SLR to use, so I do not have to rely only on the ELPH 100 HS.  If a compact Canon ELPH is nevertheless desired, I would suggest that a 300 HS for about $50 more should be considered.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Camera", "Author": "Logic227", "ReviewID": "R203IRLL5N8ZOU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Canon Elph 100 HS Pros and ConsPros- Good looking and small- Nice large 3.0 inch LCD screen- Very good photo quality! When using this camera, I suggest you keep in auto mode. Its a really good auto mode unlike other auto modes on other digital cameras. You will always get a sharp shot with less grain. The HS system really helps.- Very good 1080p for a small camera.-  Cool shooting features. Toy camera, Poster effect etcCons- On Amazon its states that the camera can \"optically zoom while shooting video\". Not true. Its digital zoom which was a HUGE disappointment for me. If you like zooming a lot, I wouldn't recommend this camera. If you like zooming in optically during video, check out the Elph 300 and Elph 500 HS.- NO autofocus during MOVIE mode. This was another HUGE disappointment for me. I do a lot of close up shots during video and I can't do that. I called Canon and asked them if the camera autofocus's and they said yes it does. They told me to reset the camera and I did and still no autofocusing. I honestly think the camera doesn't autofocus at all during video. You can set it to macro mode, but I personally like autofocusing better. If you like autofocusing during video, check out the Elph 300 and Elph 500 HSConclusionI do like this camera a lot. It takes great still images and has some cool features. BUT I REALLY REALLY like zooming in optically and having autofocus during video.

There are a lot of good products from which to choose.I next went to Best Buy, Office Depot, and Sears to hold different point-and-shoot cameras made by the major producers:  Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, etc.  For me, these visits to different retailers is an important part of the process of buying a point-and-shoot digital camera for the first time.Another important step is to learn whether or not the camera's software is compatible with your desktop computer.  Because my computer is old (2006), I had to research compatibility with the different cameras that I liked.  You can find the information at the product websites.Canon has a very user-friendly website that influenced my purchase considerably.I had XP Service Pack 2 on an older Dell Dimension E310.  For the Canon, I had to download XP Service Pack 3.I ordered the camera from Amazon.com.  From the moment I opened the box of the Canon ELPH 100 HS, I liked everything that I saw.  The instructions are clear and organized well.Finally, I love the pictures that I am taking.  No, they are not the same quality as those taken by friends and family members who own thousands of dollars worth of camera equipment.  However, these photos are beautiful and fun to take.I am practicing now so that I will be ready to take photos at baby showers and graduations in the next couple of weeks.Is it easy to learn how to use the Canon ELPH 100 HS?  It is VERY easy to learn how to use Smart AUTO.  The sliding Smart AUTO button is on the top of the camera:  you slide the latch to Smart AUTO, and you are finished.  The camera \"decides\" whether or not to activate flash and also determines other settings.To learn to use all of the optional features (P mode) is fun but not essential to photographing great photos right away.Another reason that I bought the Canon ELPH 100 is that it is considered to be among the best in its price range -- and possibly THE BEST -- in low-light conditions.  The only time the colors seemed to be distorted somewhat was when I took photos of pets sitting in a semi-darkened room while they were directly under the strong light of a table lamp.  I found that the bright light from the lamp washed over all objects close to the lamp; the objects outside of the lamplight were fainter in color.  Since then, I've taken the precaution of composing photos more carefully so that I am not creating a spotlight effect.I read that the ELPH 300 could be a better choice if you plan to use the video features a lot.  For me, the video features on the ELPH 100 are fine.While in Playback (viewing photos that I have taken), I am learning how to use the displayed menus to select options such as Slideshow and Erase -- so far, so good.  While not as easy as Smart Auto, the menus are fairly intuitive.I have been very pleased.

We googled the problem to find that it is a flaw well know by users of Canon Powershot cameras and is not acknowledged by Canon as a flaw in camera design.The exact problem that occurs triggers the the Canon E18 error which happens when the lens gets stuck while trying to extend. The camera will beep a few times and the LCD will display a little E18 in the lower-left corner. The lens gets stuck in the extended position, and refuses to move either to focus the lens or to retract when powered off. It's annoying as heck.

The C-60 was a couple of technological generations ago, and didn't have image stabilization, which makes the biggest difference.  This is particularly noticeable when taking no-flash photos.I paired this with an 8GB Class 10 card and it is snappy.  Some people have complained about delay between pictures, but I am completely satisfied in this respect, and I wonder if the memory card speed has something to do with it.The only disappointments I have with the ELPH 100 HS is I thought the best-pic-of-three feature was standard, but it's one of the non-auto shooting modes.  Macro is also only available in non-auto modes, so it's kind of annoying to have to switch modes, scroll to the non-filtered option, and then turn the macro on.  The quality of the photos is sometimes disappointing - low-light photos tend to be grainy, and with other photos (haven't determined the precise causes yet) the color seems overly vivid.  With most of my other cameras, Photoshop's auto-levels/contrast/color would almost always improve the picture, but with this camera those Photoshop features usually make it worse, so I spend more time manually correcting.Overall, very happy with the camera.  Picture quality could be better, but it is not bad for the price range.  Size of the camera is awesome, way more easily pocket-able than my previous Olympus.

It is tiny, even for an Elph, and the photos are far better than any previous Elph I've owned.  (I've owned four now.)  The screen is nice and big, although it got a scratch within 1 week... something that had never happened to any of my previous Elphs over a period of 10 years.  I guess that's what happens when the glass is so huge.My biggest complaint is about the ridiculously tiny controls.  I have slender fingers and can use most small electronics without a problem.  This is VERY HARD to use because the buttons are EXTREMELY small.  The D-pad is barely usable.  Fortunately, the flip side is that the automated scene selection feature has been improved so much that you almost never have to use the D-pad or other controls.  Basically, I just shoot in auto mode all the time and all the photos come out fine.  Once in a while, I'll switch to the program mode so I can shoot the kids running around, but mostly I don't need the controls any more.  This was a real paradigm shift for me after so many years of constantly adjusting the ISO and exposure of my Elphs to get the lighting just right.Having said that, I am still a habitual deleter of excess photos while they are still in the camera, and the lack of a delete button is a serious design flaw.  To delete a single photo, I have to press the ridiculously small buttons 4-5 times.  To delete a bunch of photos, I just sit there pressing (or mis-pressing) buttons for 10 minutes.  I guess if you are the type of person who simply manages your photos after they are on the computer, you won't have this problem.  But my spouse is always filling up the memory card, and then I end up having to delete dozens of pix or movies to make more space on the camera.I guess the only other flaw I would point out is that the camera is so small, and the glass is so large, there's almost no way to take a photo without sticking your thumb directly on the glass and smearing it.These are all somewhat minor gripes compared to the quality of the images that the camera takes and the benefits of having such a compact camera.  I also love the color options so that I no longer get my camera mixed up with someone else's.

A small digital camera is almost always on my belt for quick access. I need a need a quick-start camera that's fast, easy-to-use that stores good EXIF information (leaving my iPad and Blackberry out of contention).After owning two Nikon digital cameras I purchased my first Canon in 2008, the SD750 (aka `old camera'). It worked well until getting caught by a closing car-hood.I purchased the ELPH 100 from Office Depot the same day the old camera was damaged thanks to their helpful employees. I didn't read reviews until after the purchase, noting there are more 5-star reviews than all the lower ratings combined.The learning curve was short with many similarities to the old camera, yet with a number of new features.Most of my shots are at 640x480 resolution to facilitate uploading to my websites and emailing to customers. A number of photos are taken under the hood and near the instrument panel; macro image quality is important, especially in low-light conditions.Some short handheld videos are recorded for youtube presentation; video quality that's 'good enough' will work.Under $200 USImage stability with overrideShort power-on to shoot timeGood low light and macro capability for shots 3~6 inchesPlusses:+ The 'Movie Digest' mode stores 3 seconds of video before each photo and stitches these together into a daily video summary.

Faster/easier than looking at all the photos taken during the day.+ 'Smart Auto' feature automatically switches modes and informs me via the display.+ flash: on, off, auto in all modes (that I've used so far).+ Ergonomics: the size is 'just right', fitting perfectly into a Nite Ize clip case . I looked at the ELPH 300 and it's just a little too small for my tastes.+ Usability: All the functions are easy to access.+ Usability 'Hints and Tips'; short reminders at the bottom of the screen. Turn 'em off after you've become a power-user.+ Excellent documentation.+ Contacted Canon support on 3 occasions over the past 10 years; their phone, email, and chat-based support are excellent.+ HDMI 1080P movie capability, remote control via HDMI w/remote.+ Categories: user-assigned, 'favorites' and others.

Videos are awesome, as well as outdoor shots. Now that I've tried all weekend to get a decent indoor shot, the love has gone. I will give it another chance in the coming week, but probably will return it.  And it's not like I'm an inexperienced photographer--true I'm not a professional but I know enough about cameras and how to use them.  Like I said, videos and outdoor shots are great, but no matter what setting I used indoors, the pictures are too soft -- even with trying post-processing they don't hold a candle to my older Fuji and Panasonic cameras' indoor pictures. What I don't understand is VIDEOS shot indoors are perfect, why don't the pictures look as good? (It's not the indoor lighting, I had enough lighting and they still aren't great).If you have large fingers and short nails, you may have a problem with the buttons on this camera.  I have small fingers, short nails for a woman as I can't type with long nails, and I have problems with pushing the menu/function/set buttons on the back.  I wish they'd made the LCD screen slightly smaller like the 300 HS Elph which is 2.7\" diagonal, as it would have left more room for larger buttons.The menus are easy to learn, the movie quality is fantastic.  But if you're looking for OPTICAL zoom during movies, buy the 300 HS Elph instead.  This 100 HS has digital zoom only DURING the movie, you can optically zoom out first though, before you press the movie record button. Even if you want to use the DIGITAL zoom, you must change the settings in the menu. Speaking of which, there is a dedicated movie button which is a plus.  A lot of cameras in this price range you have to get into the menu to change to the movie mode.As this camera uses a rechargeable lithium-ion battery (Part# NB-4L) instead of AA batteries, the recycle time after taking a picture, even with the flash, is pretty quick.  You can even help it along by lightly pressing the shutter button (but not enough to take another picture) and it will be ready even faster.I have always loved the software that Canon provides with its digital cameras, this is no exception.  Does a good job of cropping, auto-enhancing, and adding text if you want. One feature which I thought was kind of cute is you can add additional start-up pictures and sounds (for start-up, shutter clicking sound, etc.) when you attach your camera via the USB cable. You can even choose a small barking dog!Build Quality:  75% of the body is metal and also has a metal tripod mounting on the center bottom. The battery/SD card door is flimsy plastic, you have to be careful with it like you do with most cameras.  Normally I never attach the hand strap on my cameras as they can in the way of a shot but with this camera being so tiny and hard to hold, I opted to use the strap.China or Japan - From reading reviews here and on other sites, Canon makes some of these in China, some in Japan.  I don't think there's any rhyme nor reason - but FWIW, mine is the gray color and it was made in Japan.  The build quality / fit is flawless and the zoom motor sounds perfectly quiet.  I read on other sites you could tell which country it comes from the outside of the box it comes in.  On my box, it doesn't state which country.  Mine states Japan on the bottom of the camera, near the serial number.A case that would fit this camera:Lowepro Volta 20 Camera Case (Black)And if you'd rather have the 300 HS Elph:Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Full 1080p HD Video (Silver)", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera is really worth every cent", "Author": "Alex Lahoda", "ReviewID": "R164DHG1NJGROP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been reading all those 1-star reviews where people kept saying something like \"ohmygod, camera's bad, camera broke, pictures are bad, lens are awful, do not buy this\" etc.What can I recommend those people is to throw out their hands, not camera.

For me the key criteria is the quality of indoor photos since most cameras (and smart-phones) take excellent outdoor photos. I have purchased and returned several cameras, that while more compact than my old S50, simply could not take indoor photos that were remotely comparable to the S50.My first indoor photos with the Canon 100HS produced similar results; OK pictures but not very crisp. When I started to experiment with the camera to see if I could improve the quality of the indoor photos I found that when the camera is set in the Auto mode all of the indoor photos are taken with an ISO setting of 400 or higher. If you take the camera out of Auto, set the camera to \"P\", and set the ISO at either 100 or 200, the sharpness of the photos is consistently greatly superior to what you get in the Auto mode (which automatically adjusts the camera to a high ISO setting). While I have not used the camera enough to determine if you can just set it in the P mode with an ISO setting of 100 or 200 and leave it there for all photos, both indoors and out, I suspect that you can. If you cannot do this, then I will end up using the \"Auto\" mode for outdoor use and the \"P\" mode for indoor use.In any event, this camera takes much better photos indoors in the \"P\" mode and it is very easy to set up to use it this way.

It has SO many different settings to play with that you do get inspired to take up photography as a fun and challenging hobby.On the technical side, I love the amply sized viewing screen, the user friendly layout, and what I really like is that it has a fast shutter (a problem that was the bane of my existence with previous digital cams since I love taking pics of fast moving objects as well as night time scenes). You can choose the file size of your pics & vid, has really good zoom for the price, and the battery life is also a big plus!The reason I give this a 4 instead of 5 is that the video quality leaves much to be desired.

Sme\"", "ReviewID": "RUWXPU5G082TR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a Nikon user, but typically carry a Canon compact as the so far Nikon hasn't made a compact that can compare.The 100 HS has an HD movie mode, takes well saturated color photos , and has plenty of gimmick modes (color swap, miniature mode, fisheye, etc.).  Most of these are simple software conversions that could be done in Photoshop but are added so you can see the effect right away.The modes I like and use are the high speed (sports) burst, low light, and slow motion movies.  At first the high speed and low light modes sound amazing, 8.2 frames per second and an ISO of 3200.  However, it does this by lowering the resolution to 3 megapixels.  At one time that was considered high res and can still be used. The low light pictures, back to back with my Nikon D700, have poor dynamic range and pronounced shadows where the D700 shows shades, but a picture is better than none. The slow motion movies, in 120 or 240 frames per second, are genuine fun to use but not of very high quality.Other modes I haven't found much use for is the \"Smart Shutter\" that focuses/zooms on people's faces, which never seems to work right, and the \"Best Image Selection\" which again is 3 megapixels.In general the 100 HS is simple to use, just power on, zoom, and press the shutter button.  I sometimes have it fire when it hasn't focused, but that may be intentional; a picture is better than eternal focus lock.  I typically get about 200 shots per battery charge, and have an 8GB card I haven't filled up yet.  You don't have all the manual controls of an upscale camera as it is a compact, but it still beats any smartphone.  For pocket carry I put on an LCD protector screen and bought a cheap $7 case to carry it in.  Extra batteries are cheap and they make two underwater cases for it, one for snorkeling use and one for scuba.Overall if you just need a camera for taking snapshots this will work just fine.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pocket camera", "Author": "Malcom Grant", "ReviewID": "R2976IMDMP80HV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I primarily use my digital SLR camera; however, on occasion like the flexibility of having a small camera with me.

So I sat down for few days and looked really hard for a good camera that I can trust. I researched Nikon, Canon, and Sony - since I know all three brands are good.This is my list that I need to have in my camera: good in low light (The Kodak did not do well with it at all), fun modes for me to play around, good megapixels and good zooms - I did not want 16 or 18 (12 is good enough for me, it gives me what I need), and easy for me to handle when it comes to budget. I know there is better ones out there with more money, but I cannot afford them. I looked and finally narrowed it down to two. Nikon COOLPIX S3100 14 MP Digital Camera with 5x NIKKOR Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and 2.7-Inch LCD (Red) or Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS. I finally picked the Canon camera after the boyfriend's sister encouraged me to give it a try.Must I say - it's so nice. I picked gray since there were no red (my fav color).

She had been hinting that she wanted a camera with video, and something like my Pentax K-5 was overkill for her to use. My must haves while shopping around were that it had to be extremely easy, with quick start up, video, and an mini-HDMI output so that we could watch playback instantly from both my DSLR and her point and shoot on the big screen. I figured that this was a tall order for under 150 (her cap), but found several options in that range. At that time, the 300HS was being offered for around 200, but this camera was at a paltry 130, and I could see no real upgrade to the 300HS so I bought this. I have read reviews that the 300HS offers upgraded video features and scene settings, but this camera has the biggest screen size of the 3 models in this line, and frankly, that matters.cons: Auto focus is generally fast and intelligent, but snapping the picture can be a little laggy, and I feel I often have to hold down the button for a bit too long to take the shot. the form-factor, while sleek and convenient feels a little slippery in your hand, and almost seems to want to slip out of grip.A couple of things to note: 1) You take video by pressing the large record button on the back of the camera. I know it sounds obvious, but I am used to having to select video from a wheel, so the unmarked red dot didn't strike me as the right place to look. So as I demoed this camera among others in the price range, I was very frustrated with being unable to find the confounded video mode - of course, it couldn't be simpler. Just focus on your subject, adjust your zoom, and hit the button (no adjustments while recording). 2) You can hand it over to technophobe like my wife and have them take fully automatic images, just slide the selector on top of the camera to auto, and done.After six months of baby pictures and video, this has been one of my best electronic purchases to date.

I'm embarrassed that I've tried to substitute with smartphone cams for the past two years. I can't believe how advanced this camera is.Amazing clarity, speed, processing power, and smarts. We upgraded from a dutiful and still-working ELPH 700.  If memory serves, several years ago I payed almost twice as much for about half the camera (resolution, quality, lens). I made the leap for the video and the amazing price.1080p HD video looks fantastic.  Great compression, a little noisy with fast pans and \"busy\" scenes (windy trees, water, etc).  But for a camera that can stay in your pocket, it looks great.Still photos, because of Canon's new HS software, come out with a huge dynamic range, lots of good gradients and blending, and quiet, clear lines in high-contrast shots.On image lock and shooting times from other reviewers: this camera wants you to be happy. It will not blindly fire away in Auto mode without having some time to think. If you want instant response, head over to the functions menu and use sports, night, kids, etc.  Otherwise give it the .5-1.5 seconds it needs.  TIP: in auto, once it does decide on the image type--keep firing the button and you can get several shots quickly (1-2 per second if no flash and you have a quick finger).My only star drop, and this is important if you value video: this lens config DOES NOT ALLOW ZOOM IN RECORDING VIDEO MODE. In other words, whatever lens length was when you hit the red button is what you're stuck with during the shot. It does allow digital zoom in, but that's just active image cropping and looks bad in the end product.Therefore, I am upgrading to the 300HS to support that feature.

The first thing that attracted me was the color, but that aside, it does great in low light, just like it says and you can choose to shoot totally automatic or switch it over to manual and either choose one of the preset shooting modes or just adjust your own settings. It has a great 3\" viewing area and the controls are very similar to my old Canon so it was pretty easy to move over to this one. I find myself grabbing more for this one now, than my old one. It takes great pictures and I like that I can use the larger storage memory cards. The handle is about the only thing that they could have done better on. My old camera has a nice, flexable, soft handle with a sliding part where you can make the handle opening larger or smaller. This new one has a stiffer, vinyl like handle with no adjustment for the opening. It just seems a bit cheeper to me, but the camera itself is amazing. If you want a camera that will do it all for you, this is great for that. I am very satisfied with it's quality and the quality of the pictures it takes. Canon is a good brand.One note: it does not come with a memory card so I had to buy that separately.

I have been several places and have had the battery go dead.  Either buy a spare or find a camera with a longer battery life.  (Maybe if I set the picture size lower, the battery would last longer - but I like the full size pictures, so I haven't tried that.)Other than that, this is usual great Canon quality. It's very small, has a big, very nice, screen in the back.There is no viewfinder, only the screen.  My previous little Canon had a viewfinder; but, most little pocket cameras don't have that.

Redeye is generally not a problem and there's redeye removal in the camera (in addition to your software): remember this is a point and shoot camera, so that's a good thing.  Lastly, one of the features I think is handy is the i-Contrast feature which is designed to increase overall contrast.  At times, there's a slight increase in noise with i-Contrast, but you can turn it off (and you can apply it in playback mode at different leves, auto, low, medium, and high).

The optical image stabilization puts it solidly above most point-and-shoot cameras I've used.I bought this because it's just about the smallest real camera I could find, and I wanted something I could easily carry with me.  The only drawback to this is that the buttons on the back are quite small and can be a pain to use.  On the plus side, the interface is very straightforward and there's no selection wheel full of options I'll never use.  Another refreshing change from other cameras I've used is that the camera explains the significance of most settings, so even those you don't use very often won't confuse you.Video quality is also pretty good.  It'll take 1080p videos, but only at 24 frames per second, which generally looks jerky.  I much prefer the results at 720p.  Zoom and autofocus do not work during video recording, but you aren't stuck with webcam-style fixed focus, you simply have to set zoom and focus before starting to record.  I think this has something to do with the microphone picking up the noise caused by the moving parts in the lens.  You can also take slow-motion video at up to 240 frames per second, which is a neat trick - although 240fps is not always fast enough to capture a whole lot of detail you can't see anyway.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Top Rate Product", "Author": "Stanley I.

However, in the end I returned this camera and opted instead for the Canon Elph 300hs (black), which is the next model up from this one.  This decision was guided by several factors.  First, the 300hs has a wider angle lens (24mm vs. 28mm) and this is useful indoors as it captures more of the scene.  Secondly, the 300hs is made out of metal (the 100 is plastic) and it feels extremely rigid and well built. Also the black textured paint on the 300hs is fantastic as it offers a nice secure grip. Lastly, the button placement on the 300hs was, in my opinion, better thought out than on the 100hs. Other than the differences stated above the 300hs and 100hs are very alike and would perform very similarly.

It is a nice little camera, very compact, well made with a solid feel, and it has all the features you would expect and that most people would need. I have used it quite a lot over the past 6 months, about 1400 pictures or so. The image stabilization works well and low light performance is not bad; in fact, much better than my Lumix TZ-5. However, there are some negatives. The zoom is quite limited, but that's perhaps not unusual for a camera of this size. My main problem with the camera is that the pictures are not very sharp, even in high light situations, where the Lumix far outperforms the Canon. Obviously the Lumix has better optics, but the Canon should not be too bad, so I assume the reason for the softness is primarily a fundamental limitation of the sensor chip. For this reason I would not recommend this camera.

All I really want is a small camera that takes decent pictures in auto mode.  I have an SLR if I want to play with settings but with a small point and shoot camera, playing with the settings just isn't worth the hassle.  It has to work well and consistently with everything set to auto.  This does what I need it to do quite well.First of all, it's small.  Really small.  Very pocket-able.  The lens fully retracts and has a built in cap which is great.  The screen is big though relatively low resolution, but good enough for framing shots and being able to tell if the picture turned out.  The 4x zoom is fine given the size of the camera and the controls are easy to work.  The flash is on the opposite side from the shutter release so I'm less likely to hold the camera with my finger in front of it.As expected, picture quality in good light is very good.  Focus speed is good when you pre-focus the camera with very little shutter lag.  If you just mash the shutter button all the way down trying to get a quick shot it's not quite so fast, but that's not really the proper way to use the camera anyway.  Flash performance is decent and I have no complaints about white balance.  Low light performance is decent.  The camera seems to ramp up the ISO intelligently based on conditions and noise reduction vs. picture quality seems well balanced.One pleasant surprise was the video quality.  I never really considered video as much more than an afterthought with point and shoot cameras, but the results from this camera are actually pretty good.  Good enough that I realized how outdated my mini-DV camcorder was after seeing far superior video quality out of this point and shoot camera and prompting a camcorder upgrade.  A newer dedicated camcorder will give better results than what this camera can, but if I'm out and about and have the urge to shoot video and don't have the camcorder, the results from this camera will do just fine.Overall, this is a nice simple camera to use and gives me pretty good results.

For the most part you can just leave it on auto and let the camera do most of the thinking..which suits the old folks just fine.Takes great pictures with and without flash. Without flash in low-light conditions is where it really shines. These pics may come out a bit softer than a regular camera, but with a lot less blur, so its a net positive by a mile. What matters is the pics in low-light no-flash conditions look a lot like how it is seen with the naked eye, so that was a huge difference over the previous point&shoots; we've had.I also have a DSLR, but can't carry that around casually.

Within a few minutes of opening the box I had snapped several great pics, although inadvertently I also took several video clips of the ground too, lol. A few minutes later I had deleted the video clips and emailed the pics to my family to show off my new camera. It really doesn't get much simpler than that. I especially like the large viewing ability as it helps me take pics with a sense of confidence that 'here is the moment' cause I can make out the details so well. I have also printed the pics out on my printer and they are good, although darker than it appears on screen - but perhaps this is my printer, not the camera. I have to play around with that. I have heard others express concern about taking pics in low light with this camera, but I haven't tried that yet.

The settings are more numerous and precise (unless you, like most users, choose to leave the camera on permanent auto mode); image stabilization is better (even though its far more crucial on the phone cameras), the lens and, now, the stereo mics provide images that can compete with the best any 1080p flat-screen TV is capable of.  On top of those features, this entry-level Canon has burst mode, permitting me to get the right picture at the right moment of my pets (2 cats, maybe a piglet one of these days) and grand-kids.  Unless you've caught the super-telephoto lens bug that camera manufacturers are using as a primary ploy to lure more customers to the dedicated point-and-shoots, the Elph 100 should satisfy on practically all counts.I still hang on to my SD-780 because it was the last Elph to have a viewfinder (which I still count on during the high-sun times of the day) and because of the great shots and videos it's given me in the past as well as my discovering that a 3X power lens actually serves me better than a 10X, 15X, or 20X power lens (please don't afflict your friends with endless \"zoom shots\" merely call attention to the gadgetry of the camera and detract from your subject--besides making some of us feel the effects of vertigo and sea-sickness).  Most of us will get far better photos and videos if we stop messing with the zoom gadgetry and use are bodies to move the camera closer to the subject.  Many professional photographers want no more zoom power than is required for a portrait lens that can keep a respectabile distance from its subject.A wide-angle has more uses for me than a zoom, enabling me to capture a larger field of action as well as to take advantage of its superior depth of field.  If I were moving upward in the Elph line, it would be to a camera with a slightly wider-angle lens (24mm is better than 28mm) and slighly wider aperture (the SD-4000, with a f2/0 setting was the Elph champ at available light shots).  But the Elph 100 carries the HS suffix, reassuring the user of its superior capabilities at capturing available-light and even night shots without flash.[Although Amzon's prices are the usually the lowest among internet stores and, especially with Prime, come with the least hassle at the ordering and, if necessary, return stage, some times you'll be surprised at the specials to be found at the manufacturer's main consumer site.  In fact, I recently saw this camera going for half the price on the Canon site (and there's no need to be cautious about \"refurbs\" from the manufacturer, which have always be inseparable from new to my eyes and come with the identical warranty.]", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "MY LITTLE ELPH POWERSHOT", "Author": "Linda M.

The second one works as good as the first but we bought it at a lower price because the updated model for this year has more megapixels. Whoopee. I lost interest in the megapixel race at about 8MP. What's important is the camera's ability to focus and expose the image properly and the speed of startup. The Elph 100HS is good on those points and gives clear and well exposed images. It has plenty of zoom range for normal use. There's always a tradeoff when buying a camera with a lens over 4x. The long zooms don't gather light as well in low light conditions and long zooms add weight and size. The 100HS lacks some advanced features of more expensive cameras like continuous shooting mode but for average picture taking it's a steal at the current price.

That was an 'impulse buy' based on a great price.  After checking the reviews at Amazon, I could see why the price was so low.  There were lots of poor reviews on that particular camera for the same reason.  This camera is going to Europe with my daughter in a few months, so what good are 14M pixels if the pictures are not focused properly?I researched other point-and-shoot cameras on Amazon, and came up with the Canon ELPH 100HS as my next target. This time I carefully read the reviews and downloaded the owner's manual ahead of the purchase.  Yes, I paid a little more, but it was worth every penny.  The picture quality is so much better!  The images are consistently clear and well-focused.  The HS (high sensitivity) feature produces great shots at low light levels as well.  Some of the low light shots are even better than those of my own Canon S5 IS camera, although the S5 uses older technology.  I am thoroughly impressed with this model!  It even scrolls helpful hints at the bottom of the display, in case you can't remember what certain settings are used for.  You can turn off the hints if you prefer.  Read the owner's manual from the Canon website and you'll see the complete feature list.The 1080p full HD video is amazing as well.  I played back a video on my Vizio LCD TV using a mini HDMI cable (purchased separately) from the camera, and I was impressed.  The video was as detailed and smooth as any HD video that I've seen from a camcorder.  I used a class 10 32GB card, so that my daughter can capture over 5000 pictures or 1 hour of HD video when she tours Europe.

I also own a Canon Rebel T2i. While the 100 HS gives the Rebel a run for its money, there is a distinct difference in performance between the two. The much more expensive Rebel is a better camera. However, it is significantly bigger and thus more to carry. When traveling, and not wanting to be branded as a tourist, the 100 HS is quite satisfactory. The smaller camera is also less likely to attract thieves. I suppose the 100 HS can take pictures suitable for publication; if managed carefully. I've used it for about three months with no problems. The last two weeks have been heavy use - over a thousand pictures. I've been downloading to a Mac Air and have found that the quality is reasonably close to a Rebel a friend was using. I also downloaded the Rebel's shots, many were of almost the same angle and subject - it was hard to tell the difference (a more skilled photographer than I would likely see the difference).

I already knew that the ELPH100 disabled the zoom when in movie mode; that was no problem since I'm not a fan of zooming in and out while the video is rolling. What I didn't know was that the autofocus is also crippled. Now, what good is a point and shoot camera that doesn't maintain focus?The whole point of a point and shoot is that you can point it at something and get a decent picture--or video--without having to waste time fumbling around with settings while the action around you passes by. After all, life waits for no one. Especially children or grandchildren.If it was just the movie-autofocus problem, I would have been tempted to keep the darn thing, and I was close to doing just that. But no...I had to go ahead and test the pointy-eared, little ELPH's picture quality against my old, 5MP, brick-like, troll-of-a-Sony. (Seriously! With its fat, weighty little, metal body; you could really hurt someone with that ancient thing if you whipped it around by its wrist strap.)The picture quality of the Canon ELPH isn't really that bad, but when you consider that it has a technological leap of seven or eight years over the clunky Sony, it's far less than impressive. The outdoor shots looked harsh and the highlights more than a little blown out. And the colors? Well, our green garbage can looked yellower than I ever imagined it. Sure, the sun was bright on that day here in Florida, but my old Sony Cybershot didn't seem to have a problem with it. Colors with the Sony looked much more natural and as true as one of these cheap little cameras can get.Some might say that it's not fair to judge the Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 solely on its preset, automatic features.

Wang", "ReviewID": "R29UWTYO771NIS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loooove Canon PowerShots, I've owned roughly 6 of them in the past 6 years (Yes, SIX) and every time one breaks, I go and purchase the next and newest PowerShot model because I love them so much.  I find the interface so easy to use as a non-technical user, and the camera has always been one of most compact ones on the market so I just keep it in my purse 24/7 (because let's face it, most photo-worthy moments are not the ones you plan for..  The battery is awesome and holds a charge forever.  This newest model does not disappoint - although I have to admit that I never really see a huge difference in functionality/performance between each successive model, other than the greater megapixel capability.It is with a heavy heart, however, that I have decided to move on from my beloved Canon cameras.  The one huge issue I have found (and trust me, the fact that i've had 6 of these in the past 6 years should prove this) is that they are have no longevity - they are NOT hearty, easily breakable and delicate.  Between my numerous cameras, I've found the durability to be one of the poorest attributes of these cameras.  I can't always fault the manufacturer as some of my broken cameras were inevitably my fault, but there were some major problems that went wrong with some of these that should not have happened.  Here is a brief list of how my 6 cameras met their demise:1. Canon PowerShot SD200 - Had 2 years - Dropped off a stool. Yes, 100% my fault, but the stool was like 2 feet off the ground and the camera was totally dead afterwards!  So I'll say 90% my fault.2. Canon PowerShot SD300 - Had 10 months - When camera would turn on, lens got stuck and wouldn't come out. Perhaps dust or something got into it, but the lens refused to expand and contract and camera permanently and made a grinding noise instead.  Replacement lens was so expensive that camera repairman just recommended I buy a new camera.3. Canon PowerShot SD1000 - Had 5 months - LCD screen stopped working.  Camera could take pictures but wouldn't show up on screen.4. Canon PowerShot SD1200 - Had 5 months - Washed into the ocean (100% boyfriend's fault)5. Canon PowerShot SD1300 IS - Had 1.5 years - Giant fuzzy black spot started appearing on the screen gradually.  It was so faint at first that it wasn't a big deal, but now it's so dark it makes people look like they don't have heads in photos.  Very scary.6. Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS - Currently own.So two of these problems I will completely take fault for, but the rest of them just kind of randomly happened over time.  As a result, even though I love these cameras and have been incredibly loyal to Canon for a long time, I'm not sure I can continue to afford purchasing a new camera every year.

The image size varies between 1.5MB to 3MB, which itself states that the picture details are missing due to lossy compression for a 12MP camera model. CMOS sensor is better in compared to CCD said by experts, but same scene i captured in EPLH100(CMOS) and Sony W530(CCD) the Sony wins the race. After this i am really doubting the CANON CMOS capability. I thought of buying the SX40IS but i really doubt on CANON ability over Sony HX100v and Panasonic FZ150.Please avoid buying the ELPH series rather think of the these: Fuji F550,Canon 230HS, Sony WX9v, Nikon S8100 which are almost close to this range.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "lIKES AND DISLIKES", "Author": "aramig", "ReviewID": "R5Q9526XN0E5P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the camera because it's smaller than the newer models.What I don't like is the fact that I could have bought the camera from FRY's for FIFTY dollars cheaper.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "would have been a 5 star product if a manuel had been included", "Author": "The Bee", "ReviewID": "R2ETILQ35U119X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wonderful camera.  But for some odd reason, Amazon chose not to send the owners manuel with the camera.  Strange, as I had to look it up on line and download 212pages of manuel.  Would have LOVED to have the manuel to take with us as we aren't always going to be able to access the computer when shooting pictures with the camera.  Printing 212 pages is a bit expensive and bulky as well.  Why Amazon did not include the manuel for a product of this value and complexity is very strange.  But the product is a great product indeed.  Again, we would have given the product five stars if we had a manuel.Another strange thing is that there was no option for seller's feedback for this item.

Hence, the one-star rating.An interface cable is supplied so an amateur photographer such as myself would reasonably assume that he could transfer his photos to his computer to be edited and stored. Nowhere in the LONG description (which is meant more for experienced users than for amateurs such as myself) does it say that you cannot transfer your photos to your computer without a memory card in place. Can I print photos from the camera? After all, this is a \"point and shoot\" camera meant for John Q.Public. The memory card offered for sale next to the camera implies that you can have more storage if you buy the card in addition to the camera. It does NOT say that it is a necessity if you want to do anything with your photos besides look at them on the camera's screen. All that being said, it is reasonable to assume that the camera is ready to go when taken out of the box. Maybe Canon's PR people are not looking at these negative customer ratings.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Piece of crap.  Broke on first day.
