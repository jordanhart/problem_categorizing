For the money, I am delighted that I chose the D3200. It's light weight, and quiet.The tutoring menu is more for beginners, and it has many pre-sets to take creative shots easily. Love the 24MP, and find no noise even shooting at 6400 ISO.I bought it to shoot stills, but it has excellent HD video with slow motion.You do have to run manual with the older lenses, but that has only caused me to up my game.It's the most excellent DSLR value currently available!!", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Water Polo Mamarazzi Recommended", "Author": "Rebecca C.

Good camera for people who love taking pictures but have no time to muck around with understanding all the camera's technicalities.  Having a 24 megapixel resolution allow real tight cropping without loss of clarity.

Operation is very easy and it will show me anything I don't know. The most remarkable thing is the resolution. 24 megapixels. The pictures I take are absolutely beautiful. At $500 for the body only (I have lenses) it is a great deal.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "bakranz", "ReviewID": "RXXSLCC0AQUW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Enjoying it so far.

I decided that it was time for me to upgrade but I wanted to do so at reasonable cost and easy carrying weight. So after doing my research I decided on the D3200. I made the correct choice. I find that it has more or less the same feel and weight of the D3000 and my teleconverter and lens work  perfectly with it. Additionally, apart from the major upgrade in pixels per image, it focuses very quickly, takes multiple frames in a flash and is ready to shoot even while it is still saving data from a previous shot. The picture quality is very high and if required the supplied software - or any similar ones for that matter - allows for all the usual computer processing, I recommend it unreservedly.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Used camera", "Author": "Michael Long", "ReviewID": "R2NP6MAVUBVTRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the camera was refurbished and so far it's been great.......

I am totally happy with the results of this camera paired with the Nikon 40mm micro dx, the Nikon 18-105mm vr dx and soon the Nikon 55-300 vr dx lenses.  The pictures are easy to take and are clear and colorful, both outdoors and indoors and day or night.  Amazon.com made it happen; convenient, safe, and delivers on time according to plan.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon D3200", "Author": "As I See It today \"Scifi n Mystery Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R17E724D9PK2A9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been taking pictures for 46 years starting with a Kodak 620 reflex film camera.  In college I upgraded to a Contax 139 Quartz.  This was treat for a serious hobbyist.  It took many years after digital imaging arrived before I put a toe in the water.  My wife and I picked up a cheap point and shoot 3mP for a vacation.  One of the shots won an award at a local festival.  This changed my mind about digital.As an interim jump we picked the FugiFilm FinePix S9000.  What makes this camera shine is the FinePix picture engine, great low light and flash photos and a comfortable sealed unit.  It also uses AA batteries that can be purchased anywhere.  These features make it a great camera for travel everywhere.  Poster sized enlargements can be made without distortion.  The downside is that the LCD is small and the eye piece is not through the lens.It was time to upgrade to a true D-SLR.  After conducting extensive research we set our sights on the Nikon line.  Comparing Nikon feature to feature with the competition most things were equal except Nikon cameras felt better in my hands.  The controls, handling and balance were close to my old Contax 139Q.So far the photos have been very good.  The option to go semi or full manual opens up a world of creativity.  Having the ability to work with RAW files also expands artistic options.  I am very pleased with the speed, flexibility and functionality of this unit.  Can't wait to get the WiFi adapter working with an Android device.  The software for this is only available at Google Play for Android.  Make sure your tablet, phone meet the requirements before purchasing the WiFi Device.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera Great--service not so much", "Author": "Gail Schmidt", "ReviewID": "REB932HRIFX3W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is a good one, love the features, but the seller failed to get it to the UPS store in the necessary time limits for me to receive it on the LATEST expected date.
