And with 8 megapixels, the shots are very clear and full of detail.  However, you can't just click and shoot with indoor photos; to get the best quality you really must read and understand the users manual.  Even then, it still takes a great deal of tweeking to get the perfect photo.I highly recommend purchasing a memory card as the internal disk does not hold many photos.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "very dissapointed customer", "Author": "Ramon Enrique Berliza Yorro", "ReviewID": "R3NWNQM4QNQU9B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this item and i am frustrated. horrible image and i can not transfer the pictures to my pc.

Mansell \"JGM\"", "ReviewID": "R1FNTS6ABTIRB8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Fuji uses standard SD cards which makes it just as handy as any other camera (Fuji finally got away from expensive xD cards).  I like the feel of the camera because it doesn't feel like a cube of platic, it feels like a real camera should. I have had no problems with the picture quality the other reviewers mentioned. I also find it quite easy to navigate. It seems to have good battery life and has been very reliable and inexpensive to use since it takes only 2 AA batteries.  I would rate this camera at 4.5 stars.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible Camera", "Author": "Sam Bleuel", "ReviewID": "R2DEWLO1UXXEBV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is very thick and heavy. Not something I'd recommend taking walking around, compared to slimmer cameras.The battery life is also horrible. I take a few photos a day, for a couple days, and the batteries need changing. I always have to take spare batteries while going out with this camera.If it's really sunny out, the photos are over-exposed. Often get red eyes, even with the red eye reduction.It's OK outside if it's not too sunny or too dark.It takes horrible indoor photos, it's ALWAYS grainy.The pictures never look like the scene they're captured in, no matter what setting you choose. (I've had problems with all of them)I cannot take clear photos of up close things like jewelry and things like that. The photos come out fuzzy and blurry most of the time.Don't even think about cropping photos, they're even more grainy than normal photos.I paid $100 for this and it's not even worth that! There's tons of cameras on eBay for that price WAY better than this one.I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA FOR ANYONE!", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not worth $60", "Author": "Daniel Night \"Do to others as you would have ...", "ReviewID": "RCE5BUJ8FDO6K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It's really hard to get good photos with this camera and it has some major distortion problems. Pricing it over $70 is a stretch, and over $200, how absurd unless it's pristine and for a gallery of camera types of some sort. You can expect every picture you get from this thing, to, half the time be plagued with graininess. It's very poor in low light conditions and the lens is easy to scratch.
