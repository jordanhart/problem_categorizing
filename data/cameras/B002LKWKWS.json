I used a program to quickly step through the pictures and there wasn't even a flicker of difference from one to the next on about 285 of the pictures. There were about 5 that had my wife walking into the kitchen. The shutter speed was so slow the picture was blurry. If I hadn't known who it was, I wouldn't have been able to tell from the picture.There is a display on the back that you use to set the date. Once operating, it displays how many pictures it took along with a battery indicator and the word \"Hi\". The instructions are ridiculous but I was able to figure out how to set the date/time. What I can't do is alter anything else. Apparently, the sensitivity is so low that it just constantly takes pictures. With a 2GB memory card, I should get about 25,000 pictures based on the instructions. Unfortunately, that's less than 3 days.

This camera kept missing the shot of whomever was taking stuff and the shots it did \"get\" were too blurry to be usefull.  It seems that the motion detection system often detects movement before the subject moves into the photo frame of the camera so it kept taking photos of nothing even while stuff was getting stolen \"rght from under it's nose\" so to  speak.  The lens has too narrow a field of view to be of much use in most single person offices.  While I did capture some photos of the cleaning lady, etc.  However, the photos were of such long duration that the people in the photos where severly blurred because them were moving when the photo was being taken.  In short, it missed every shot of someone taking something and blurred the rest of the photos.  Definitely NOT a camera to count on - especially in even mildly low light.
