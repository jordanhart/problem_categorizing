{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little Point-and-shooter", "Author": "John Cesarone", "ReviewID": "R9Z0NGJIVWVTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was initially hesitant to buy this camera since there were ZERO reviews to be found, either here at Amazon, or elsewhere on the internet.  But, since I've owned two previous Nikon Coolpix cameras (an old 4 MP camera, and a really old 2 MP camera) and both were great, I wasn't too worried.  And I was right to buy it: it is working great and taking great photos, after several days of playing around with it.First of all, it is very user-friendly.  The menus and controls are completely intuitive, and make sense even if you have not cracked open the manual. (\"cracked open\" being a bit of a misnomer, since the manual is electronic only; the paper manual that comes with it is just a \"quick start guide\")Second of all, it is a gorgeous piece of machinery; cute and cuddly and shiny and impressive.  I'm afraid my girlfriend is going to try to steal it, it is so cute.  I may have to buy her one to preemptively stop that from happening.But, most of all, it takes great pictures.  I walked all over town the first day, putting it through its paces, and scrutinized the photos on my computer when I got back home.  If I was going to have to return it, I wanted to do so quickly, but I don't need to.  The photos are great.It is a point-and-shoot, which means that you don't have direct control over shutter speed, aperture, etc.  But, you do have a dozen or so \"scene modes\" including Beach, Museum, Sunset, Panorama, Action, etc.  These are very handy.  I haven't tried them all yet, but they seem to be well designed.The second day, I put the camera through its paces inside the house.  No problems; it takes great indoor shots, providing excellent exposures both with natural light and with the flash.  The wide-angle 4.9 mm lens (equivalent angle of view to a 27 mm lens in a 35mm format camera) was especially nice: you can stand in a corner of a room, and get the entire room into the photo! Nothing left out.  That is pretty unusual in an inexpensive fixed-lens camera.My third day test was to take the camera to the beach on a bright, contrasty day.  It performed admirably, maintaining both shadow and highlight details, and rendering the deep blues of the sky and water, as well as the bright sand, equally well.  This one's a keeper, folks!Another nice plus: there is a \"16x9\" mode available in the \"shooting mode\" options.  This doesn't quite use all 4000x3000 pixels; it only uses 3968x2232 of them.  But the images are perfect \"HD\" format, and completely fill up a typical wide-screen monitor without any stretching.  Somehow, they look all the more impressive on a computer screen than the typical 4x3 ratio.Final tidbit:  I bought the camera from Amazon, which was $10 cheaper than the local big-box store, had no sales tax, AND allowed me a 30 day return period with no restocking fee (which would have been 14 days AND a restocking fee at the local store; they need to get a clue).Anyway, as an overall impression, five stars easily for the Nikon Coolpix S3000........JC", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix", "Author": "jenny", "ReviewID": "R238R31MEJB1FM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a GREAT camera. I had been cursed with the kodak easy share (older model) for years now and no matter what, I could only take about 10 pics before the battery died. I love the Nikon its small- light weight and perfect fit for me! Im not a professional photographer but I can take some great pics with this camera. The options that the menue gives you for photos is amazing! I would highley recomend this camera above kodak! They made everything VERY easy for inital set up also! Once I opend the package, did the camera set up, I was ready to take pictures within 3 minutes (once I charged the battery fully which only took about 30 minutes). I bought this camera because I was going on vacation and was tired of going places with an unreliable heavy camera and now feel so lucky to have this one! Ive never taken so many pictures before that its like a whole new world for me. This camera will also give you and option for \"blink protection\", \"auto correct\", and so MANY other options. Great camera, great price compaired to Walmart, Target, and other store/web-sites. Also Amazon was the only place I could get this cool green color. Stores werent carrying this color yet (only the purple, black, and some of them had the orange). One last thing I want to mention is the speed of taking the pictures. What I was used to was press the button wait about3-4 seconds then wait about 8 more seconds before you could shoot your next one-not so with the Nikon. I can practically take pic after pic with it - its great!", "Date": "July 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon CoolPix S3000", "Author": "Angela \"biograd1\"", "ReviewID": "R3SYF1NBDZRFKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I bought this camera I did a lot of research on digital cameras. I narrowed it down to three brands. Canon, Nikon, and Sony. It took a very long time to make a decision since I didn't want to buy crap. I eventually settled in the Nikon brand because I am very familiar with its features and camera functions. I was replacing a cheaper older model of a Nikon Coolpix L10. So, I was definitely going spend a little over $100 for this camera, but then again cameras have come a long way since the 2007. Even if I didnt buy the S3000 I knew I would get something better than my older camera due to the advancement of the compact camera technology.This camera is great for everyday/events picture taking. After having the camera for a few days, I tested it out when I went to a family reunion. I got many compliments and inquiries about where i got the camera from. I believe I took about 100 pics in the two days spanning the family reunion.Camera Features:I took pics using a wide variety of the camera's features. The micro mode was pretty cool, the camera was able to focus on the subject and the picture did not come out blurry.It was pretty easy to take a pic in panorama mode. At first when I took the pics that would make up the panorama pic, I wasnt sure how the whole pic would come out, but the panorama maker software that comes with the did wonders. Once you out the pieces of the panorama pic in the correct order the software makes the panorama picture for you. Now that I know that I made a great panorama photo I will be using this feature very much in the future.This camera definitely tells you if someone blinked in the photo after the photo has been taken and you can always opt to take another pic. Continuous shot selecter is also a nice feature. You can choose to take 3 continuous shots or 16 continuous. Pics in low-light or darkness are excellent and always give light exposure buy the flash and orange light on the front of the camera. I took a picture in my room with the only source of light in the room being light from a television and the picture came out as if a ceiling light was on.Other features that are nice are skin-softening, smart portrait(recognizes faces), 17 scene modes including panorama, subject trackingVideo: For a compact camera, the video quality was great. The sound quality was also excellent inside the video too. Playback on my laptop was seamless. You could hear words and sentences very well in the background of the video. It's NOT HD, but I could make out everyone in the video and nothing at all was blurry.Battery is a plus since you can charge it, as oppose to change AA batteries all the time. The charge is very short as well.Definitely get a case for this camera, it is very compact, slim, and small. I have a case logic compact digital camera case. I bought my case at Walmart for $7 and cents. I feel like my camera is very well protected.Overall I am very happy with my purchase of the Nikon Coolpix s3000. Its a great everyday camera for the busy college student or for someone who just wants to capture life's moments.Definitely buy this camera, it well worth your money and you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "McWriter356", "ReviewID": "R1NF9APQSZNTBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the silver Nikon s3000.

Maybe I was just spoiled by my speedy, trusty old Canon, but I'm tired of missing the moments I want to capture. Here's how it usually goes: My toddler will smile and by the time the camera finally takes the picture, she turns her head and THAT is the image I'm stuck with.

I was sad to see it go, but I thought surely the latest Coolpix based on the popular S220 model would be just as terrific, if not more. I was...wrong. First let me point out that I realize these are \"cheap\" point and shoot cameras, and we certainly can't expect astounding performance. But notice... is there a single \"Best Point and Shoot cameras of 2010\" guide that so much as mentions the S3000? I haven't found one. This camera feels... cheap. The buttons feel flimsy, it's noisy, it has a lousy reaction time, and many photos I've taken that have no business being blurry are, of course, blurry. My computer also doesn't recognize the camera, even after installing Nikon Transfer. A quick look online will tell you other people have also had this problem. The S220 was a solid, great performance camera for a point and shoot. The S3000 had big shoes to fill and came up short.

Like any point-and-shoot, 12MP isn't really the same as on a larger CCD.  Lack of a regular viewfinder.  LCDs are what drag the battery down most.  Shutter button and tele-WA switch are loose and \"rock around.\"  No real constant showing of remaining battery, although it lasts quite well.This camera arrived with a totally DOA charger.  The light on the charger doesn't even come on.The LCD did not have the typical static-plastic cover, but did have a fingerprint. Makes you wonder if these are seconds or returns.Pretty rare for a Nikon product.  I guess that's the value of local purchase since returning to Amazon or Nikon is a time delay I don't have right now--and the shipping cost.

But she's learned how to alter her flash and scene settings, and practices around the house in different lighting and focus points to see what the camera can do. Great for snapahots of friends, and scenery when on vacation. took some nice photos at night on vacation, but just keep people within 10-15 feet for best shots. Flash is good, but is not big, so its a recommendation to keep your subject within a decent area. Camera has settings that can shoot up to3200 ISO, and adjust white balance.Bad thing is there's only a digital guide on CD, so everytime you need to refer to something when learning how to use it, you need your computer around to read it.

Buy for what you really need the camera to do. If you don't need a lot of the special features, this is a great purchase saving several dollars from the next version up.

The camera offers multiple focal points and that may be the root cause of the problem.

If you're using a $100 camera, you probably just want it around the house to take pictures of your kids and out and about for quick snapshots.  Your best bet with this camera is to set it on 'Auto' and set the autofocus to 'center.'  Set this way, you find focus using a box in the center of the LCD screen, then adjust the composition and press the shutter.  If you set it the the facial recognition, you'll get a lot of out of focus shots (like I did).  The facial setting is great for parties and weddings and anytime people are posing with nothing in the foreground of the picture.  If anything is in the foreground (for instance, you're shooting your kid on the sofa, but part of the coffee table is in front of him) the camera will focus on the coffee table and your kid will be out of focus.  Better to center focus on your kid, change composition, and shoot.And speaking of shooting, the shutter is fairly slow, so you need to anticipate action a little more than usual.Overall, I'm happy with this little guy.

The camera offers multiple focal points and that may be the root cause of the problem.

My Canon had served me well, but I figured it was time to upgrade to a higher mp for the sake of image quality.  I researched several cameras in the price range, then stumbled onto this one.  It had some great reviews, it was a huge leap to 12mp, and I loved the way it looked.  After a little more comparison shopping, I decided to go with this model.My first impression was that I loved the look, size, and easy to decipher buttons and menus.  The camera charged quickly, and it was easy to get rolling taking pictures.  I didn't have any of the battery/operational issues others had described in their reviews.  Unfortunately, even with the camera in macro mode the pictures were not great quality.  I decided, rather than rushing to return the camera, to take plenty of time to research and ensure that I was employing the modes and functions properly to get the best results.  I tried shooting in various circumstances, including natural light and indoors with my tabletop photo studio and lighting, experimenting with different factors to try to get better shots.  Time after time, old faithful outperformed this model.  I hoped that if I got accustomed to how this camera worked (even though it's features and menus were almost identical to those on my old Canon), that I would see an improvement.  Unfortunately, no improvement.  Close-ups were often fuzzy, indoor shots often had an unattractive yellow cast, even with careful attention to camera mode and lighting.  I guess my old camera had my expectations too high, but I figured going from a much older model with much lower mp to this would result in good/better results with less work.I had fallen in love with the compact size, pretty color, and overall look of this camera, but no matter what I tried I could not make it perform well enough to warrant keeping it. :o(", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this Nikon Coolpix S3000", "Author": "Sandra L.

I was looking for price, size, and picture quality.  I looked at the Coolpix cameras with touchscreens, but trying one out in the store, I found it wasn't very intuitive.  My previous camera was a Canon Powershot.Overall, I like this camera.  The viewing screen is large and clear, the pictures seem to be good quality (based on viewing on the computer; I haven't printed any out yet.)  I find this camera very easy to use overall.The manual is lacking.  There are features that are simply not included in it.  Personally, I think that if a manual is included, it should explain everything.  I shouldn't have to hunt for information online.  Still, it covered the basics well.There are two aspects of the camera that I don't like.  First, there is no battery status indicator.  I want to know right now how much battery I have left, and I can't find any option for this in any of the mentions.  There's no mention of it in the manual.  I would expect there to be some sort of indicator, but I haven't found it yet.  I don't want to be surprised by suddenly having a dead battery.Second, I find it odd that the battery must be charged while it is in the camera.  I plan to buy a second battery.  With my Canon, the charger worked on the battery alone.  While traveling, I wore out my battery.  I put it in the charger, put a second battery in my camera, and took more pictures.  By the time I got back to the hotel, the first battery was charged.  Charging doesn't seem to take very long, so this probably won't be much of an issue, but I'm still surprised by it.Aside from that, this seems to be a good quality camera for its price.  I consulted with friends who do photography and they said that, unless I'm blowing up pictures to a huge size, 10 megapixels is plenty, so I feel good about this purchase of 12mp and 4x zoom.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "good camera for the occasional photog.", "Author": "Mikel R.

I like to carry a point and shoot camera as well as my DSLR because that's how I roll. I needed something in a relatively low price range since it was a spur of the moment purchase, and I came across the Nikon Coolpix S3000. It has great features and an even better price. The reviews seemed to be mixed, so I decided to go for it. Here's what I think:I really really like this little camera. This is saying a lot since I primarily shoot Canons (Gasp!) I really enjoy the no fuss automatic features of the camera (hence the term \"point-and-shoot\" (duh), but I also like how easy it is to switch modes in case I was on the beach 10 minutes ago and then I want to take a picture in a cave in the pitch dark now. I've read peoples' complaints. One I agree with is the zoom trigger on the shutter being a little wiggly. It is. But I think that as long as you treat the camera with love and care and not wiggle it as if you're trying to get out a loose tooth, then no big deal. It certainly doesn't feel like it's going to come off. To the people who complain about it taking blurry pictures, well, learn how to use the camera. Take a minute and read the manual. I happen to be a photographer and I know how cameras work. The technology of the camera these days is amazing, however, they are not miracle workers. If you shake like a crack head while taking a picture it will be blurry. The automatic settings aren't programmed to handle you chasing your child while they are running and jumping and such. This camera does give some options and modes to help this. Same to the people who think the colors came out all wacky. There is white balancing to correct it, or for the auto focus, that is programmable, too. The first place I played with this camera was a trip to Mexico (in the sun) and I never had a problem with a glare on the LCD screen. I also put a screen protector on it so it wouldn't get scuffed as easily.The only complaint I had was it seemed to lag a little when saving photos, but I also have it set to save large sized files. So, it's probably my own fault. But honestly, I like this little camera. Great flexibility, great battery life, and super cute!

I think whats happening is that the battery drains if I just leave it in the camera, even if its not being used. I really have no idea why this happened as it was not being over used or mistreated in any way. I even bought a replacement battery for it to see if that would fix the problem, but it didnt sadly. I would avoid this camera as much as possible. I know they came out with a newer model of this and I dont know how good those are but I dont wanna find out.

I like to charge my batteries in a charge, take the battery out and pop it in the charging base.  I find the little door to charge the camera to be delicate.  The battery door is nice.

I could have checked, but I didn't since I am new at this.  My husband took the camera to a Rangers game last week and used the video, and he was very happy with it after watching it online.

This camera is only good in the day time. Then I find it takes great photo's. There are many settings to choose from and I like that as well. The 4x zoom is nice to have. But the different settings dont always work. Esp the night ones. We took pictures in TN at night and almost all of them looked like crap on the night settings.

I sent it back, to them, this time with the battery and the charger. They again sent it back 'no trouble found' with a note that I was using a 'non- Nikon battery'. I played their game and ordered a Nikon battery, which still didn't work. The camera cost me about 130 bucks. Now, I'm at the point where I have determined that it is no longer worth my time to do anything further, but to write this review. The camera as of today, 10/15/2013, still cannot hold a charge. I will replace it with a Canon product. I also have a Nikon D7000 which I love, but, now, I am afraid that if anything happens to it, I'll have to deal with the same people that couldn't or wouldn't repair or replace a $130. camera.

They would rather not have a camera at all and I don't blame them. The camera takes horrible photos!  Flash is slow, the color, and aperture is always off, and it takes forever to take a picture.  As my 8 year old niece put it best. \"The moment is over by the time the camera takes a picture\"  I'll add by saying and it's blurry when it does take!

I had a cheap forty dollar vivatar that worked better than this piece of garbage. First I thought I did something wrong to the camera, but after seeing the reviews on here, it seems like a lot of people have been having the same problems I'm having. The memory card slot is messing up. You put the memory card in and it won't pop back out like it's supposed to. You have to find some way to get it out and it's almost impossible, even if you use tweezers.  I know it's not the card because I tried several and got the same result. Now it says that the memory card cannot be read, so it's basically useless because the camera itself without the card only holds like three pictures.The shutter speed is super slow and I find it very annoying, especially if I need to take a picture quickly. You hit the button to take the picture and instead of taking it, it beeps and a red light flashes and that's it. The zoom isn't that great either and the picture quality sucks.  Sometimes I can get good pictures if I'm outside, but that's only about 50% of the time. Honestly, the only things I liked about this camera were the color and the battery life was pretty long.I thought Nikon was supposed to be one of the best brands...that's why I bought this camera in the first place.

Considering the fact that this isn't an High Definition Camera/Camcorder, I'd have to say that the Video Quality is still pretty good. Unlike some other cameras out there which use AA or AAA batteries and have the hassle of recharging from AC outlets, this camera can charge itself from anything \"USB\" which is great. People savvy in Photography can tweak a few settings and get great use out of this Camera. For those reviewers who are complaining that this takes too long to start up, i suggest turning off the auto focus. although not being a professional photographer and not knowing all its settings, but i can tell you, it performs well for what i use at work mostly for presentations. i usually keep the resolution down to 5 megapixel as a 12 megapixel file can get upwards to about 5 MB which takes too long to upload. The Video that i uploaded was done at 640 by 480 resolution. It is about a minute long and is 86 MB in size. The Colors look pretty acceptable to me for a Basic Digital Camera with Video Function. I don't really use the Video Function but its nice to have. As far as pictures, i have not had a single grainy picture since i bought it a year ago. As a matter of fact, coworkers ask me what camera i use due to crisp pictures it produces. No wonder why the NASA used Nikon Lenses for Telemetry and Imaging Applications (Based on the information published in Wikipedia). Bottom-line, i love it and for the price and together with the Nikon name brand, you cant go wrong!", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "Mikeyboyka", "ReviewID": "RI8C4LM2SJXH1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera right before our 1st trip to Mexico- loved it.

And the reviews seem quite positive so it can't be a terrible little portable digital camera. I was planning to give this as a gift to a friend to upgrade her old Nikon from 2004. So, I bought the Nikon S3000 and excitedly opened the box, and was happy to see the new Nikon S3000 just as pictured online.But things can be deceiving...sure the size is wonderful, slightly larger than a credit card, and about 3/4\" thick and very lightweight so it's a definite easy-pocketable camera! The power to on/off is quick, buttons in good locations and very easy to understand menu, feels nice in your hand, zoom in/out is quick too, and the design looks very clean. The large 2.7\" LCD is bright and not much different from a 3\" (which is what I'm used to).So what's to complain about? Well, if all the photos you take are distance shots or portraits, this is probably a keeper! If you ever want to take macro shots, this is NOT the camera - the Nikon S3000 cannot focus at all! I mean I was really surprised testing out the camera. It doesn't even have autofocus! Even after setting the \"little flower\" for macro, I was not able to take close-up shots unless I was AT LEAST 3+\" away from the object! WOW, that's some bad macro...I mean, think about the times you want to take a photo of a label, or display, or text or sign, you won't be able to with this camera unless you want alot of wide-shots. But most macros are meant to be tight.The charger is also a BIG surprise, and a NEGATIVE one at that! You cannot charge the battery unless it's still INSIDE the camera! That's just dumb. Most people are used to taking out the battery to put it inside a separate wall charger and carrying an extra battery to use, but the Nikon S3000 is designed poorly so that you cannot even use the camera while charging your battery!Overall, great price, great photos at a distance, poor macros, inability to charge battery separately, lack of autofocus are all what makes the Nikon S3000 a DO NOT BUY!

So when we wanted something that we could take with us without having to worry about damage/theft/loss, we decided to stick with the Nikon line of cameras.Like I said, Nikon makes a great SLR, but stay away from their point an shoot cameras. Here's the list of problems this camera had (we returned it of course):-poor white balance on auto mode-slow to take pictures-very slow to save pictures before you can take another shot (no difference when you take a lower resolution pic either!)-will not use flash on auto mode... even in the dark-have to use manual setting if you're not outside during the day, otherwise your pictures WILL come out yellow and blurred-will only record 10 seconds of video before it tells you it cannot record video and stops (maybe needs a high speed flash card for this?)-navigating the menu on this thing is a nighmare... takes 30 seconds to get it right-resets your settings every time it goes to standby or when you turn it off! Seeing how you need to use manual settings to take a decent picture, this is a HUGE problem.Only reason I give it two stars is because it seems well-built, battery lasts for a long time, and it IS capable of taking a good picture, but only if you're interested in still shots and you have lots of time to waste while messing with all the settings every time you'd like to take a picture. To call this a \"point and shoot\" is a tremendous misnomer... there's no such thing with this camera! It's a \"turn on, change settings, point, shoot, wait, wait, take another shot because your settings weren't just right and your picture is blurred, oh.. nm, it's too late!\" camera.I'm going back to Canon for a point and shoot. I've had their cameras in the past and even a 10 year old point and shoot Canon will put the S3000 to shame when it comes to usability.This is one of those products that Nikon should have left on the shelf.

Why not alert DURING THE PURCHASE PROCESS!  Oh, I know why... now they have my money and i have to go through the process of CANCELING my order.

Why would one bother ordering items that are not in stock? The very least ANDORAMA could do was alert the buyer that there is a shortage or put a  \"not available\" status on the item vs. having the customer go through the wasteful experiment in making a ghost purchase.
