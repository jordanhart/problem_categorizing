The pictures came out beautiful. I didn't know when I bought it that it didn't have sound on the video. (Not sure what Nikon's logic is for that). Had I known, I would have purchased something else. I do not recommend this camera b/c there are plenty of other good cameras out there in the same price range with sound. I paid $125 at Target and I think this model may only be available at Target. Look around, you can definitely find something better", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Had this AWESOME camera for over 3 years....but", "Author": "W.

Takes beautiful pictures.  Just caught my daughter doing something cure on the video and found (after hours scouring the manual & online) that there is no audio.

Hunt", "ReviewID": "R23BSTNCWFXKO1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We had this camera for 2 months before it gave a \"lens error\" message that will not go away.  It will not take pictures, and the lens will not retract or move.  It whirs and clicks and moves a little, but then stops and gives the error message.  It was never dropped, jostled, or abused in any way.  Naturally, this problem is not covered under warranty, and to repair it will almost as much as it cost to purchase.I did an internet search of this problem, and it seems to be VERY common with this camera and with other Nikon cameras.

So far it has been a great camera.  Takes really great pictures and fairly easy to use.  I have just a few issues though.  First I wish there was a better battery meter.  The camera does not warn that the battery is low until you are down to the last dozen pics.  A battery level gauge would be nice.  Also it would be nice to be able to recharge the battery via USB cable for times when a 120 volt outlet is not available or for times when I don't want to carry (or forget) the AC charger.  Other than these two issues a very good entry-level digital camera.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Still working hard ...", "Author": "BobbieK", "ReviewID": "R3IVCH7CJTCLEJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as something light to carry in my pocket so that I can always have it on hand for photos. I was aware that it did not have sound when I bought it, so I wasn't disappointed, although I would choose a different one today.This has bounced around in my purse and taken countless photos, but is still working. The worst thing that happened was that I lost the charger and had to buy a new one.I had been taking my quick photos recently with my iPhone, but needed some clearer photos, so I grabbed this out of the closet, and it continues to work away.Technology is outdated, but camera is still nice.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix Digital Camera", "Author": "P.

The pictures it takes aren't bad, but if you use the flash the pictures will make objects/people look a little white because of the reflection. I bought this camera to record videos and take some quick pictures but turns out that the videos it records DON'T!!! have sound. This camera records videos without audio, I don't see the logic in that. You can find a better camera for the same price or lower.
