I spent 3 or 4 days reading the manual. The 50X zoom is amazing; I can nearly take a photo of an individual feather on the birds at my feeders 3 feet outside my window. This camera has so many more features than the camera I replaced that I'm in awe; 6400 max ISO, 12mp for starters. Some features I've tried out but not had an opportunity to use on a regular basis. One feature I love is the color swap: select a color to replace, select a color to substitute, indicate how close the match to the replacement color has to be, and the substitution shows up when you're framing the shot. The panorama was a little more tedius to use than I expected, but my old camera didn't have panorama, so I imagine I'll get used to it soon. I like the backlighting feature/mode. Continuous shoot mode is so fast. It even has focus bracketing. It will take me a while to be able to use most of the features without refering to the manual, but I so love this camera!", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon sx50 with camer kit", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "R1TZ5938Q54BRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera rocks!

The lens is awesome, giving clear shots out to 150 yards, as well as very good focus up close. The camera bundle I got was what sold it- I'd rate a 32 gig chip as necessary. Works well in relatively low light conditions. I got clear pictures of Elk and a Moose right after sunrise, without full light. What I didn't like was the charger was not designed for use in a car- I had to buy one separate for travel, though not expensive. Also the little tripod is more a toy than anything useful. I had trouble finding the righ shoe to fit my tripod, even though its a universal. You need a 2nd battery for sure- I got less than 100 shots per battery, not a problem if you have one to change to. For the money a great camera. The bundle from Amazon is well worth the expenditure.

Overall, we were quite happy with the camera until it simply stopped working.  There was no warning.  One day we had a camera.  The next day we had a really slick looking paper weight.  I know know that, if you own that particular camera, a sudden critical battery failure is a question of when not if.  So, it was time for something new.  We looked at other similarly inexpensive models but decided it was time for an upgrade.  The reviews on the Cannon were excellent so we decided to give it a try.  I should also point out that Amazon offered the best price by far.  Bottom line, all the good reviews you read are spot on.  The reason we gave this camera four stars instead of five was because of two minor design flaws.  First, if you take a still shot while shooting video, you can hear the click on the video.  That seems to be the case even if the sound functions are turned off.  Maybe there's a way around that.  If so, we haven't figured it out yet.  In addition, taking a stillshot while shooting video will make the video frame briefly freeze and go black.  We haven't found a way around that one either.  Really, our only other complaint (and that's really too strong of a word) is that there's a lot to learn.  This camera has a lot of functions and features and is not designed for the beginner.  A quick start manual comes with the camera.  The real manual is a pdf file totally a few hundred pages.  Expect a bit of a learning curve.

Everything else you need comes with the camera or the kit.  The package was sent to me by Fedex.  FYI, the mini tripod is tiny even by mini standards and does not hold the weight of the camera, but I think the kit is worth the extra money.

In some ways, it is almost better than a digital \"single-lens-reflex\" or the kind of camera where you can change lenses. This is because the 50x optical zoom lens on the Powershot goes from a the 35mm equivalent of wide-angle 24mm to telephoto of 1200mm which is a huge range of focal lengths. ( 4.3mm to 215.0mm.) You are going from wide for landscape and group shots to zooming in great distances (wildlife, moon, sports closeups from the stands.)If you want a camera to do everything, and not have to lug equipment, this is light and versatile. A few not-great things--the LCD screen is a lower resolution than I'd like. However the lens is so wide-ranging that if you can only take one, lightweight camera, this is quite the choice. You can get more Megapixels from other models of Powershot like the SX170 and you can get WiFi which this DOESN'T have in other models like the PowerShot SX510 HS. But this is a good choice for quick shots at any distance. Used, these run about two-fifty or three hundred. New, unrefurbished around four-twenty-nine.This is my choice for a grab-and-go and do-all camera, where 12MP of resolution are a good trade-off for lugging a DSLR and all the gear. Plus you're more likely to be able to handhold shots that would require a tripod with heavier cameras--however, I'd add at least a full tripod (like the Ravelli ) for situations where handholding won't work.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Christmas Present", "Author": "Andrew Griffith", "ReviewID": "R3OW37HZFYMI2Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife loves it.

Just be sure to use a tripod as often as possible when you do use the full zoom so the picture will be perfect.  Oh, and I got unbelievable shots of the full moon.

Others have dissed it, but I think it deserves five stars.  The SD card I received was a 32 MB Sony 40 mb/s class 10.  The little tripod and cleaning kit fit nicely in the very nice little zippered bag they give you with the Beach Camera logo on it.  You can move the velcro edge divider over to accomodate the camera and in the adjacent space available you can put the extra battery pack with terminal cover and the nice little cleaning kit they give you complete with Q-tips, cleaning solution, and a microfiber cloth.  On the outside end there is an elastic pouch that would be suitable to hold your lens cover, filter, etc.  You could clip the small tripod desk mount on somewhere if you think you might need it.I had a small case I used to use with my Pentax K100D for street shots, but this little case they provided will work perfectly for the Canon X50 HS and a bit of extras.  The tripod might find use in setting the camera on top of a table or perhaps on the partially rolled down window of a car, and it's small enough that who's going to complain??  It has a clip on it for a pocket.The extra battery is a great add-on and, yes, it does come with a Canon warranty card.Nice little Kit, Beach Camera!! I think Beach Camera really hit a home run: I felt I they gave me a nice little extra value I hadn't counted upon and which definitely exceeded my expectations.In a month or two I'll report on my experience with the camera itself as one who is \"downgrading\" from a Pentax K-5 with about $3K in glass to have something I can always have with me with the range this SX50 has.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price.", "Author": "Leonardo", "ReviewID": "R3S1THKBADVW68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Telephoto works nice.
