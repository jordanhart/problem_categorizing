{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great pocket camera (4.5 stars)", "Author": "C. W. Hacker", "ReviewID": "R3OQEPQWKCI9KB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using DSLRs for several years, and currently use the Canon 40D and a wide selection of lenses. I bought this camera as a pocket camera that is easy to take anywhere, and for its HD video capability, as I'm currently in Thailand for several weeks doing some geology research for my master's thesis, and it's impractical and annoying to lug around my big camera everywhere. Therefore my expectations may be different - I am not expecting perfect image quality, full manual controls, etc., because I have my other camera for that kind of thing when I want it. I'm not sure that I would want this as my only camera, because the image quality isn't perfect, but if I didn't have a DSLR I don't think I would notice.In any case, the main thing I have been using this for is taking HD video. This is excellent, and looks phenomenal on a computer screen. I haven't tried playing it on a TV but I assume it would look excellent there too. It is 720p, not 1080p like the new DSLRs will do, but it still looks great - surprisingly great, even, considering the size of the camera and its lens.Others have apparently had trouble using the AVCHD Lite codec, but I have not. I can import the .mts files flawlessly into the Kdenlive video editor on OpenSUSE Linux 11.2 with KDE 4.2. I'm not sure what the status of this codec's support in the popular Mac and Windows video editors is, but if you're using Linux, don't worry about it because it works great and the quality and file size are much better than using MPEG2. As it's a small camera with a small lens and few manual controls, video is not going to look like that from a professional camcorder or from a new DSLR with HD video, but it's easily as good or better than that from the small sub $1000 HD camcorders that are available. Manual control of exposure compensation and ISO for video isn't apparently possible - a workaround is to use the scene modes, which works decently well. The night scene modes give pretty good high-iso (i.e. grainy) video at night, even in dark bars and clubs (or here in Thailand, riding in the back of a tuk-tuk). I really like that there's a dedicated movie button - you can immediately start recording a video no matter what else you're doing on the camera by hitting the button.The camera's responsiveness is very good - obviously not like a DSLR, but much quicker than I'm used to from point and shoots, including other recent models that I've handled. You don't get full manual controls, but if you know what you're doing you can almost always get exactly what you want out of it. I usually leave it in \"Normal Picture\" mode, which gives you the most manual control. All other modes will either default to use the flash if the camera deems it necessary (which, as in most point and shoots, is almost all the time apparently), or will use the built-in LED to aid focusing, both of which are extremely distracting if you want to be discreet (or if you just don't like the look of straight-on flash).You do have to know what you want to do with the camera if you use \"Normal Picture\" mode, it's not just point and shoot - but you will get the best results. The \"Intelligent Auto\" mode works OK - it tries to decide the best scene mode for you based on what it thinks you're taking a picture of. I would suggest just dialing in the scene mode yourself (there are a lot to choose from) as when I was trying that mode it would sometimes choose the wrong thing. That would be the best mode if you wanted pure point-and-shoot action, though.Image quality is probably about on par with other point and shoots with folding optics. I don't know too much about this as I'm used to my 40D and other DSLR images. It is certainly more than decent for my purposes, though. Impressively, I've been taking high-iso shots without flash in really dark Thai bars and clubs that turn out ok - they are relatively long exposures of 1/2 to 1 1/2 seconds (or more) so I steady the camera on something, and there is motion blur, but I think that adds to the photo. The image noise in these cases is very obvious, but not overly distracting. Don't expect the results you'd get from a DSLR with a fast lens, and you won't be disappointed. Definitely practice your technique in various situations to get the best results with this camera.Menu navigation is a little strange at first. I am not sure if it is really non-intuitive, or if I'm just used to the excellent navigation on DSLRs. I think users of point and shoot cameras probably have different expectations - most probably won't have a problem with this. Once you get the hang of it it's not really a problem, anyway, but for me it really was strange at first. All the controls you want (all the manual controls available in \"Normal Picture\" mode) are quickly available by hitting buttons on the back. You don't have to dig through menus to get the the settings you need most often. It's a similar setup to that on the Canon Powershot series, and probably other cameras as well as far as I know. I really like the different auto-focus options they give you - there are more options than on my 40D, and similar options to the professional series DSLRs from Canon and Nikon. Obviously, they aren't going to work as well as on those cameras, but I quite like the \"1-area High Speed\" and \"Spot\" focus modes, which are very fast and work quite well. Unfortunately there is no manual focus, and in tricky situations it can be hard to get it to focus on exactly what you want - in those cases try \"Spot\" focus, but even there it doesn't always give you what you want.Now, of course, the big thing about this camera that calls for the high price - because let's face it, for the specs on this camera it is pretty expensive - is that it's waterproof. This works great and is really a lot of fun. I took it into the cold Pacific Ocean at Newport Beach and it held up great. Taking underwater HD video is a lot of fun. [...] I will have some more videos, from Thailand, up soon as well. I've also taken it in a hotel pool, and it worked great there too. Even if you don't plan on going snorkeling or anything with this camera, it being tough and waterproof is a great feature - I don't ever worry about just slipping it in my pocket. It's the rainy season here right now and I don't carry an umbrella, so I could easily get soaked at any time - I would be very careful with a non-waterproof camera, but don't have to think twice about always carrying this one with me.Do be careful, though, and be sure to read the instructions - there are some things you should do to take care of it so that the waterproofing holds up. The waterproof seals really could be better than they are, but if you take care of them I think they should hold up pretty well.One thing you might also want to watch out for is battery life - when I took it to the beach, I only got about 25 minutes of video recording and a few photos before the battery (which was fully charged beforehand) was completely dead. The Pacific is quite cold, of course, which may have been the reason for the short battery life, but it is something to be careful of. Extra batteries are annoyingly expensive, and I haven't seen a third-party version available yet, but I would have to recommend getting one because so far it seems that the battery life is unpredictable. I left it recording video on my desk with a fully charged battery to see how long it would last, and it went about 2 hours (which is about what you can fit on the 16gb SDHC card I got with the AVCHD lite codec). That seems pretty good, but in real life use you will probably get considerably less life out of the battery.The zoom range is pretty decent; I usually stay at the wide end and I appreciate that they give you the 28mm equivalent - a lot of other point and shoots are at their widest at 35mm, which is significantly less wide. The lens is not exceptionally fast - which I assume is due to the folding optics design - but it normally is fine, even in dark places as I described earlier. I don't really ever zoom in too much, because with the slow lens it's usually blurry except in bright light. The optical image stabilization works well, and is active during video recording (if you want it to be) to remove some of the jitter, which is kind of annoying in videos, and which you'll get a decent amount of with this camera due to its small size.Macro images are nice - you can get quite close. Be careful about the \"Macro Zoom\" mode, though - it is actually a digital zoom! You can get much closer, but the image quality really suffers. This looks especially bad if you use it during video. I suggest simply never using this option. The regular macro mode works fine. You can get closest by zooming to the widest setting, which seems weird, but it works.The camera is pretty stylish and has a nice feel and heft. It feels really well built, mostly metal, and not all smoothed out and boring like most modern electronics design. If you're into gadgets, you'll really appreciate the industrial styling of the camera, and the weight. The screen is very good; it is bright and visible in direct sunlight and will automatically adjust the brightness depending on where you are (if you set it to - you can set the brightness yourself, too). One problem with the design - and one inherent to this type of camera with folding optics - is that you will often find your fingers covering the lens until you get used to holding it. Kind of annoying, but understandable due to design limitations.Overall - I think this is great as a pocket camera, for its HD videos, and as a backup for another camera. I personally would not want it as my only camera - I would choose my DSLR. I would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone who isn't interested in a DSLR, though, and who wants a tough, neat little camera, great for traveling. To be honest, I've taken very few shots with my 40D, and quite a lot of them (and a heck of a lot of video) with this in the week or so I've been in Thailand so far.", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "T. Szymanski", "ReviewID": "RC2HA59ICTRRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great! Here's why I (filmmaker/parent)bought this one instead of others:1. Wanted to shoot HD video anywhere, any time, without having to lug around my HVX.2. Shoots on memory cards, unlike the Sony P.O.S. I bought that shoots HDV and if the camera breaks you're up a creek. If the camera croaks, at least I can get the footage/pics off of it.3. I have kids, so I never know when I'm going to want to shoot it, and this camera is easily small enough to fit into a cargo pocket or pants pocket (I'd recommend getting a body glove neoprene cell phone sleeve to put it in - fits perfect).4. I have kids, so it has to be waterproof/dusproof/indestructable since I want to take it to the pool, camping, hiking, etc.Pros:- Shoots video super-instantly and easily, recording with one button push vs. my wife's olympus which makes you go through menus.- Video is SUPER-smooth, probably because of the super-wide angle lens. I mean, rediculously smooth.- Stills look great too.- Did I mention nearly indestructable.Cons:- No lens cap at all - bad design - an indestructable camera where the lens is always exposed? always carry it in something.- STUPID USB cable that's proprietary and DOESN'T charge the battery when it's plugged in.- AVCHD Lite looks good, will import into Final Cut Pro like it's a P2 card, but is otherwise kind of a pain to deal with. The Panasonic software blows.- Expensive battery, but definitely get a spare.- Took some figuring to get the settings right for shooting with (min. shutter speed, mainly. I'd rather a photo or video be dark than blurry).- No intervalometer (sp?). That would have been cool.- Speaker/head phones jack - as a filmmaker, to put videos on this to play back to show people would be cool, but the speaker isn't great.Overall:Great camera. The next version will hopefully have a few more improvements.", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic product", "Author": "DYu", "ReviewID": "R30W4S1CPLJ98V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went going on a Carribean cruise which was going to include snorkling and scuba in addition to lots of beach time.  I wasn't planning to get a new camera but I saw that some new underwater cameras were coming out and thought I would check it out.  Now, first of all, I am a huge Canon fan and probably would have bought their underwater camera (DC10 I believe), if it didn't look like a toy.I didn't test the 3m theory by taking it scube but I did use it extensively on the beach and snorkling.  It took some great pics and I had a lot of fun just bringing it in the water and watching people get paranoid for me.  One great moment was when we got caught in a torrential rainstorm and I was happily taking pictures while everyone else was trying very hard to protect their cameras.Couple of notes:Get a foam floating strap.  Keeps the camera relatively close to the surface so it won't sink to the bottom.Olympus Foam Float Strap, 202212, RedIf you want to take widescreen pics, these won't come in at the full 12M.  It gets downsized to 9M.Outdoor pics were fantastic - much better quality then I thoughtPlenty of features to play with including beach mode, food mode, burst mode (easier then I remember my Canon).For some reason, power on takes a couple of seconds, tough to get used to after my instant on CanonBattery life good for one day, my Canon would go for a couple days.HD video came out great although make sure you have a procedure to convert them to friendlier video files.All in all though, very happy with my purchase!", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC-TS1 First Impression - case information", "Author": "T. Leistiko", "ReviewID": "R29OLQ8XNUNH9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very excited to learn of this camera.  It promised to be everything I wanted in a camera of this style, and it has delivered.For specific image quality information, I suggest you look to the professional review sites.  This is the best image quality on the market at this time for a waterproof and shockproof camera ... good enough to say you aren't making an image quality sacrifice by choosing this over less rugged pocket cameras of this size and style.  I chose this camera with the belief that the pictures taken from this will be much, much better than the pictures from the camera that is left in its pouch for fear of damage and better than the ones taken by a non-functional camera damaged by sand, dirt, and water.  With most cameras you get zero chances to drop it.  I hope never to test the feature, but this camera is designed to survive a drop from normal holding height.I chose \"Sea Green\" color.  It is a pleasant, muted color.  No reason to fear this color.No lens cap or cover!  I think this is great because the built in ones seem as delicate as the lens.  Here there is no slot for crud to get into.  However, your lens is exposed at all times.  Even though Panasonic claims to have a tough, strong lens, I would take extra care to protect it during storage.  Since it is waterproof, there is no excuse for not have grit rinsed or blown away before gently cleaning.  My bigger concern from no lens cap is in the choice of case, which I will describe later.Interface and display.  There is no optical viewfinder and that is fine with me.  The LCD is useable outdoors.  If necessary in direct sun, both the lens and LCD can be shielded by your other hand when taking a picture since the camera is thin and doesn't have a protruding lens.  The user interface on screen is good.  The Intelligent Auto setting gives just the necessary options and is good for people who don't want to mess with many options.  This is true for both movie mode and picture mode.  There is a Quick Menu button which lets you quickly change most shooting related options without going into a setup mode.  With a dedicated movie button, there are no dials or menus needed to switch between movies and still shots.  This is good because the dial is not easy to turn.  You also don't need to turn the dial to playback.  The movie button location is a little awkward, but at least there is not confusion.  The power button, picture button, and movie button are all separate in position and feel so I won't push the wrong one like I have on other cameras.  The zoom switch, just in front of the shutter button, gets the job done but does not have great control.  It might just take some getting used to.  For those who will try to use this camera with an insulated glove ... forget it.  Once you get it on, you will be able to push shutter with a gloved hand, but that is about it.  I did not find much need to turn the dial in normal usage, which is great.  I do like that it has settings for sports, beach, and snow, plus a user defined scene, which is a great way to get to these commonly used presets.Battery.  If you are going to take a lot of video, then a second battery will be necessary.  I think this is true of all small cameras.  The battery is model number: DMW-BCF10.  It has a separate wall charger with flip out AC prongs.  You have to remove the battery to charge.  Some people don't like this, but the charger is small and convenient to travel with, and it is more convenient to charge outside the camera when you have a second battery.Low Light.  Not going to win any awards here ... but not horrible.  My other pocket HD video capable camera is a Kodak V1073 which has a large image sensor and does really well in low light for a pocket camera.  But, it isn't waterproof, the screen is unreadable outside, and has less zoom so I would happily used the TS1 instead in almost all cases.Video.  AVCHD Lite is a key feature here.  AVCHD is compatible with Blu-ray players so this is the way to go for the future.  You can always choose MJPEG if you want, but I see little reason to.  I was able to play and edit without any trouble using Nero 9 on a several year old laptop.  Still not a good distribution format as friends and family may not have the technology to view it, but you can always author and burn a DVD with your favorite video editing tool.  Inside video with good (but nothing done special)light was very watchable, but I could find some noise if I looked for it.  Outside in daylight is great.Software.  Does it come with any?  I didn't bother looking or even reading the manual.Waterproof and Shockproof.  Test on your own camera.  I will trust Panasonic on this for now.Cases.  Since the camera has an exposed lens, I am more concerned about the case than with others.  I worry about a soft floppy case constantly rubbing against the lens as the camera is carried, wearing off any optical coatings and/or scratching.  My thought is that a case with a stiff backing should be less likely to do this if facing the lens towards the stiff backing when placing into the case.  The Rezo models have a stiff backing, the Tasca don't.Here is the list of what I looked at or tried.All Lowepro models:Tasca 20:  Tried it.  Too small even if forcing it.Tasca 30:  Should fit, but probably will be a little big around.Rezo 15: Fits pretty good.  Sticks out of top about 3/8\" (1cm) but flap still fold over and can velcro (about 3/4 of velcro contacts).  Will hold extra battery and still close.  (Many complain that the battery can slip out when getting the camera.  Get a small rubber band and put around the battery and it won't slip out).  Has a stiff backing.Rezo 20: Slightly different design than the Rezo 15.  I haven't tried it, but it should fit.  Will be a little thicker than the Rezo 15.  The main case is zippered, and extra area has a flap.  Has a stiff backing.  This will close much safer than the Rezo 15.  Update: Bought one from Amazon.  Exactly as I described.  Same outline as the Rezo 15 but slightly thicker ... but plenty of room in the outer pouch for battery and memory.  Since that pouch can stay closed when pulling out camera, and since camera is completely zipped (no velcro) everything is much more secure than the Rezo 15, but generally seems very bulky after putting the nicely sized camera in it, even though the camera fits as perfect as you could expect.  This is the case I will use for now and recommend to those who want something that will really protect and encase the camera.Overall, after owning for just one weekend, this camera is exactly what I expected and what I was looking for ... a camera I don't have to worry about.  Update:  After much more usage I am still very happy with the performance of this camera.  I am getting great video from such a small camera and pictures have been better than I expected from a camera of this style.", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect! Almost!", "Author": "C. Huang", "ReviewID": "R2I9CNA4RHH1H3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera when there were no review on the internet, so I actually had a hard time to pick out what I wanted. I was comparing to Pentax / Fujifilm / Olympus models.  First thing I've noticed, the LCD in the TS-1 isn't 3\", but it's the most responsive in the dark, less lagging, and sharper than others. TS-1 is also the one that has 720p HD recording compare to others.The camera dimension is probably the biggest one among all the models i've been looking around, and it's surely one of the most expensive one as well. However, the face recognition, 720p video, 12 megapixels, the feature list is going on and on, and TS-1 seem to be the best choice.i am not going to be in detail about image quality or lens quality as a pro review like [...] or some other pro websites, because I don't have those pro equipment to justify enough and accurately reviewing in scientific manner.  However, I can review as an user, my words and perspectives.= Image quality =Image turns out to be sharp! colors aren't too shabby, but can be washed out if you have high contract scene. Both skin tone and natural shots looks very clean and nice. It's 100 out of 100 score at outdoor especially at day light.High ISO can be a little noisy, even in the day light you might experiences a little noise. It's not a CANON, but colors are more vivid, things look more lively compare to canon point n' shoots. Over all experiences, I like Panasonic's color system better.Night shots it uses black fame technique, which means if you take 30 seconds to take the shoot, it will take another 30 seconds to re-process to black out the noises. It works fairly well! Night shots are pretty clean.As we always wanted from point n' shoots, is to be able to compare to our DSLR from the image quality perspectives. The truth is, due to the limitation size of CCD, you just can't get that kind of image quality no matter how advance image chip is.  However, comparing to other digital cameras at it's price, TS-1 image stands out! (compared to canon 780IS, canon's image just can't compare!)Ai modes are somewhat usable but not ideal. They are often pretty dumb. Preset modes aren't necessary smart about when to flashing the flash, or subject is behind or in front of the scene. Shutter speed isn't ideal either! Auto (semi-manual mode) allows you to change settings, but shutter only go as far as 1 second. If you want to do long time exposure like 30s, 60s, you really need to turn into \"night landscape mode\" and there aren't that many options to choose from these preset modes.  In the other word, the manual controls are very limited.There is a LED autofocus assistance lamp. It's annoying that it will pops up as bright as the flash itself, and there is almost no way to turn it off. Even you turn the lamp off from menus, it will still pop up when it needs to focus in the dark. I wish they've used infrared ray!!!!!!= Video quality =720p is sharp! Video recording on TS-1 is a bless! It auto focus on subjects! you can auto-tracking the moving subject. Zoom in and zoom out is quiet fast and quiet. video quality is a little softer than actual video recorder, but it beats VGA! It's probably one of the sharpest video recording I've seen in this price range (on a compact digital camera, not DSLR or delicate video recorder).microphone on top of the camera isn't perfect, but at least i do love the idea to include noise reduction software in camera. I was on the ferry filming, the noise reduction does take away lots of background noises! This is pretty awesome design!= Flash =Flash obviously has issues! It fires inaccurately because it falls to know how far your subject is.  It's always full amount blast! If you are too close, things tend to be too bright (especially on macro mode), if you are too far, flash still fires anyway (even flash light doesn't travel that far).Flash option is hiding under \"left\" button, is not as easy as other camera where there is a delicate \"flash\" button to press.Flash is located nearby the lens. Unlike some other models or DSLR where Flash is above the lens, it tend to create more \"red eye\" effects. Not only that! Flash also cause reflection on your dirty lens. Due to this camera has no lens cap, when lens is a bit dusty, flash reflects and picks up those dust spots.  You will see \"SNOW\" effect in your image.  This is a very annoying issue!! It makes flash almost unusable!  However, this issues happens to many compact camera, especially waterproof cameras because you have extra piece of glass in front of your lens for protection, and it often picks up dust.= camera body =Solid, heavy, but well built. Since it's waterproofed, I often wash with soap after coming back from the beach. It's very handy and nicely sealed! When I open up the battery compartment, I often hear the air pressure sound! This is not just some silicon rubber cap! The design is very well done compare to many.Camera body is brush metal look, but scratch easy! Sometimes I almost think, this is suppose to be outdoor camera, why do I need a camera bag?....  After a few weeks of usage, it shows hair thin scratches on the surface, so I guess it's not as tough as I think :(This is an internal lens focus design! Although lens isn't as big as LX-3, so the image quality might be a little worse. However, because your lens is no longer \"sticks\" out, it's less mechanical failure, and more comfortable in your jean pocket.= battery life =Is not bad, but not great.  It will last a day, but not several days. Extra battery would be recommend if you have a long trip. It's sucks you can't charge battery while it's in the camera. Battery is like canon and others, you need to use \"THEIR\" battery, not just any AA or AAA.You can't charge through USB when connected, this is kinda stupid too!= connections / software =It also sucks that you have to use their \"USB\" cable, not just any micro-usb port. Their software is just like any canon/nikon/pentax software.. the driver sucks, bundle software sucks, they are pretty useless if you already have picassa, aperture, iphoto, photoshop....On windows, life sucks a little. You need to install your own driver, and use their own \"SOFTWARE\" because it's a AVCHD \"LITE\" codec, not AVCHD spec, so many video editors won't pick up correctly or you will have sync issues on recording time.  This camera doesn't come with RAW image format, so no advance editing for photo either.On the mac, everything is just works.  When you turn on the camera while hooking up to USB, it can be a card reader (you can import photos if you want). Better yet! if you run iphoto09, it automatically picks up the camera. You can import images right into your iphoto without extra driver or anything.  Video is the same too!  imovie09 will automatically picks up TS-1, and ask to import! Import AVCHD Lite is painless in mac, you can basically click on import.. no need to install drivers or anything.= Operations =Start up is pretty fast compare to many. Focus is fast and accurate. Face recognition doesn't always work, but it will fall back to other focus mode, so it's always right on the spot.No manual focus is one let down, but it wasn't too bad. I am mainly using it as a point n' shoot candid camera anyway. However, if there is a manual focus, that would be nice!= Over all =It's an excellent outdoor camera. Waterproof works well, image quality is pretty nice, colors are pretty natural (not as washed out as Canon), well body building quality, starts up fairly fast, autofocus is fast and accurate.=== PRO ===- fast start up- fast autofocus- nice face recognition (need to add more profiles though)- well balanced color setting- nice waterproof feature- solid camera body- internal focus, it's often better idea than \"sticks out\" lens design- pretty nice 720p video recording- very bright, responsive LCD at back (but why not 3\"?)- just works perfectly without additional software or anything on a mac- video recording has very accurate auto-focus, you can zoom in / out and still remain focus (lacking this option from many compact cameras)- Just about right size and right weight (could be even better if they trim some fat though)=== CON ===- flash has issues- noisy on high ISO (expected from small CCD)- no lens cap, lens can be expose to danger- brush metal design is awesome but easy to scratch- wish to have microUSB connection- hope that USB can charge the battery or in camera battery charge option- preset modes aren't that easy to access, and often they are more than confusing. Wish for more manual operation optionsI high recommend this camera to outdoor lovers, it's a very good all around camera!  However, do not recommend if people are looking for DSLR like performance, manual control freaks, or looking for something super cute and compact.", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent, best waterproof camera overall", "Author": "michaelbuddy \"michaelbuddy\"", "ReviewID": "R2VDG6UVY2AFAH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Until this month there were only 2 or three viable options in Waterproof cameras. All were limited, and one, the Ricoh was priced WAY too high.This Lumix, my father-in-law just bought last month in Japan, same exact camera, different model number. I played with it several days. The images are very nice from what I can see. They are just as good as most other point and shoot digital cameras out. Probably not the best of the best, but definitely good. We shot outdoors and inside in restaurants without flash. We got decent shots. Basically put it up to most digital cameras and it fares fine. But with the water and shock resistance and HD video capabilities, you have a a huge win with this camera.In my opinion, this Lumix beats out Olympus, Canon, FinePix, Pentax and Ricoh for the all around status. Why? This Lumix is Water and Shockproof. Has a 10 ft water proof (which is enough for most people) Does HD video 1280x720 with Audio. Takes SD cards including the 32GB SDHC High Capacity cards. This and the video is huge for me. The Olympus does not take SD, and is limited. You can put 4 hours of HD video on a 32GB HCSD card on this Lumix. Awesome. Get a couple 32Gig cards and you are more than covered for an entire vacation with a lot of filming. Great pics, great video, all weather with just this slim camera. That's why I love it.The design is slim (the new Canon waterproof blue camera is awesome, don't get me wrong, but it's kinda big and round (and video isn't as good).This Lumix doesn't have as good a zoom as the Canon, but it's decent, and sure, it can't go as deep as the Canon, however it's small enough for the pocket, durable, takes great shots, goes deep enough in the water for most, takes the best video as all.This is the reason I think it gets best all around. If you only care about super small size, get the finepix. If you want the best underwater performance photos, get the Canon. I wouldn't recommend getting the Olympus unless they change to SD cards. Olympus' MicroSD and XD are both lame limited formats. With this Lumix you are ready for all kinds of things and it's easy to put in the pocket. Because the video is so good, I think it makes it the great all around rugged vacation camera. And I'd even consider shooting fun movies with it where perfect audio isn't required, as the quality is much better than some video cameras out now. (I haven't figured out how good the sound is yet on the HD video, so I can't speak to that, but they say it's decent quality.)Some youtube videos were posted where people with this camera were using it effectively as a helmet cam and they even hooked it to their motorcycle and did driving videos. Stuff like that is why I'm so excited to buy my own. (helicopter / RC airplane / balloon camera shots this would be great being light and video is good)Lastly, the Macro is very nice too. I'm sure there's better macro elsewhere if you compare, but this does very well and has an LED light for it too. If you have kids and you'd like for them to learn cameras and play and experiment, I think though this is not a cheap camera, it's durable, can do all kinds of nature shots and video of bugs, leaves, snow, rain, tadpoles,  and is going to perform well under some stress. I feel like with a water and shockproof camera, you're getting components that are going to last for a while and you'll hopefully only need to replace the camera when a better one comes out (or you lose it.)Hope this was helpful!", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Picture Quality inadequate / cost of ownership too high", "Author": "J. Stewart", "ReviewID": "RJ0MIAZYIJ4JZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wanted to replace my point & shoot (Canon SD7000is) before my summer vacation as the zoom is starting to stick.  I did research and got excited about this new Panasonic DMC-TS1 because the reviews said it had decent image quality, great features and was waterproof / shock-proof to boot.  Unfortunately after a week of testing I am returning it because the image quality (using the intelligent automatic settings) is just not good enough and very disappointing compared to my 3 three-year-old 6 megapixel camera.I ran a series of tests using my old Canon and the new Panny to take equivalent pics at the same time in various settings - indoor day, indoor night, outdoor (sunny and overcast), low light, kids in motion, macro close-up, etc.  Unfortunately the Panny was substantially worse in almost every category.  Specifically the color was consistently less natural and often washed out, it handled simple motion terribly compared to the Canon and it relied on the Flash in two many situations.  The most disappointing was daylight pics.  Introduce any natural brightness at all and the pics all end up with a slightly washed out look.  The old Canon by comparison handled these situations beautifully.  They both are almost useless in low light.  The only category where the Panny wasn't substantially inferior to the Canon was macro - it took beautiful macro shots.I never tested underwater because the store had fine print on the return policy that invalidated it if submerged, even though it was designed for that.  However, if you read the user manual on the waterproof features there are several major caveats.  First, even though it is also \"shockproof\" up to five feet, if you ever do drop it the company will no longer warranty its waterproof features.  Even if you don't drop it, the manual says you need to have the Panasonic Service Center replace the seal every year.  So I called Panasonic to find out what that costs.  Unfortunately, they threat the seal replacement like a repair and they charge a flat rate of $140 plus parts.  In other words, to maintain the waterproof feature of your waterproof camera, you have to pay almost 50% of its original cost every year to maintain it.  If you pay for an extended warranty, be careful to make sure it isn't voided by underwater use - some are - and even if you have one that isn't, they will void it if you don't do as Panasonic species and replace the seal annually.  Either way, that makes the waterproof feature very expensive.I did not do much testing of the manual controls or changing the default automatic settings.  This will be a family camera and I need it to be truly point-and-shoot for the other users.  So while it may perform better for those willing to play with the settings, I can't recommend it as even a decent point-and-shoot.", "Date": "May 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fun and Enjoyable Little Camera", "Author": "RS", "ReviewID": "RV3N55BA4BYE3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using my DMC-TS1 for over a month now and am quite satisfied with its performance.  Those who are real sticklers for image quality in this size-range should really be looking into either the LX3 or the G10, but those aren't waterproof, weatherproof, and shock resistant (which should make up a large part of the reason why you're considering this camera).  I looked at sample shots from the other waterproof cameras from Pentax, Olympus, Fuji, and Canon.  The only one that proves competitive is the Canon D10.  In the center of the frame of wide-angle shots, the image quality of the D10 is clearly better than that of the TS1, but as you move out to the edges (especially toward the right, upper corner of horizontal shots) there is excessive softness in the D10 images and they become worse than the TS1.  The TS1 displays some minor softness throughout the image, and is not as sharp as the D10 at the center of the frame, but is consistent in detail and sharpness levels throughout the entire frame.Here are some TS1 pros and cons based on my experience:Pros:  * Feel confident using the camera in any weather conditions.  * 28mm at the wide end with only minor barrel distortion.  * Zoom range is suitable for most types of picture taking.  * Some fun and usable settings, like starry night (for time exposures), pinhole, and macro zoom.  * Has an auto bracket feature for bracketing exposures.  * Color reproduction seems natural for the most part (see below), though perhaps not as vivid as the default setting on Canons.  * Can shoot in two types of HD video, as well as regular video if I want that.  The HD video looks great and sounds fine.  Some complain that AVCHD Lite is not usable with current software on the market, but I've been using Handbrake to convert my AVCHD Lite videos without much difficulty.  * Image quality is about as good as or better than what I'd get in most any other general consumer point & shoot.  * Start up time is fast and shutter lag isn't really noticeable.  * I should list sturdy and waterproof here, but I'm not going to intentionally test the former and haven't yet tested the latter.Cons:  * Some mild softness in images generally, especially in lower light environments, but nothing really noticeable unless you're looking for it; however . . .  * Noticeable softness at the telephoto end of the lens, though that's not too surprising given the lens design.  This mostly occurs in low contrast scenes, so don't go taking any telephoto shots of fir trees off in the distance.  * The color range that is perhaps less faithfully reproduced than others seems to be reds.  They're a little washed out.  * The regular Macro setting gets only as close as 5cm (I've been spoiled by the 2cm of my old and reliable Canon SD700).  * AWB has trouble with indoor lighting, but I've never come across a point & shoot that didn't have that problem.  * Sometimes the focusing could be more discerning--which I suspect is not a problem with the Canon D10 (I've owned many Canons in the point and shoot range).Finally, I did knock one star off of my review for image quality, but that's in comparison to what I think the ideal should be, and currently nothing on the market matches that ideal.  So, compared to what's on the market in waterproof cameras, I'd give this a 5-star review.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Survived Australia's Great Barrier Reef", "Author": "VLSI_Engineer", "ReviewID": "R284XF6QI17CZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for a snorkeling trip to Australia's Great Barrier Reef.  To make a long story short, we were not disappointed.  As somewhat of a film/slr/dslr junkie, I have quite an arsenal of equipment (Nikon D70, D90, D700, FM2).  Besides this camera, I brought a point and shoot Canon SD1200, and a D70 on the trip.- It's really nice that the strap cinches and locks around your wrist.  Waterproof cameras usually do not float and the TS1 is no exception.  If you let go of the camera over a stretch of deep reef, it is gone.  Cameras are lost in the reef all the time.  The cinching, locking strap prevents this from happening.- The camera body does an extremely good job of resisting salt build up.  We had the camera in the water for a good two hours in heavy 30 knot winds and stronger than usual current.  The salt build up cleared up after soaking in fresh water for 30 minutes (I wish I could say the same for my hair).- Water/salt does not stick to the hardened lens which is very important because water droplets usually cause focusing difficulty.  Furthermore, as most peope know, when you have a snorkel mask on and are in ocean water, it's impossible to see any LCD on any camera under water.  Regardless of the camera, I often find myself shooting video underwater blind at the widest angle.  The same is true for the TS1.  However, the difference is that the TS1 is reliable enough in terms of color, exposure, and focus that I don't need to see the LCD underwater.- When you bring the camera out of the water, the TS1 has reed-thin drainage lines that move water away from openings.  I found that it is best not to open the camera until the pooled water near the buttons has drained to the bottom of the camera and the exterior is completely dry.- The still pictures underwater were sharp, in focus, and exposed properly.  The AVCHD video underwater was stunning.  When I look at the high definition videos, I am still in awe of what this camera is capable of.  The video is extremely smooth.  In fact, it's a lot less choppy than my high def Panasonic SD5 camcorder.- In daily usage, the camera performs well.  In fact, well enough, that for daylight photos, I left my DSLR in the hotel room and just kept this camera in my pocket.  Of course, (as with any compact) I cannot say the same for night photos.Having a tough, waterproof compact allows you to focus on enjoying your vacation instead of protecting your equipment.  Also, as of this writing, this is the only compact that does AVCHD lite video that is also waterproof.  This turned out to be one of the better camera purchases I have made.The camera is an extremely good value, especially when you consider what it would cost to get an AVCHD camcorder and a waterproof housing (and the larger size).", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exchanged Olympus 8000, Settled on the Panasonic TS1", "Author": "Vance Skinner", "ReviewID": "RPRV8TK1IX9D7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me say I am not a professional and this Panasonic TS1 review is purely my use of the camera (thus far) in comparison to others I tried and returned while looking for the \"right\" camera.  We have a Fuji s700 for our day to day use and wanted a \"pocket\" size camera for trips and use around water.  Like most people, image quality in all sorts of settings is important.We originally purchased and tried the Olympus Stylus Tough 8000.  The 8000 has a slightly better build quality than the TS1.  Both cameras are suspiciously identical in size and layout, right down to the actual battery and compartments.  The 8000 is all metal, while the TS1 is mostly metal and some plastic.  The layout of the 8000 is excellent, a bit heavy in the hand, but solid (a tank).  The layout of the TS1, while not exactly terrible, is not quite as user friendly and feels significantly lighter than the 8000.  I give the edge to Olympus for button layout and overall feel.  Some differences for reference are that the Olympus started quickly, while you have to hold the on button for the TS1 a few seconds.  The placement of the zoom on the top of the TS1 and the stiff feel was also a negative in my opinion.Some professional reviews complained about the Olympus camera menus.  I happened to find the 8000 menu very user friendly for a novice (difference between a general consumer and a pro).  It was hard to look at other cameras that did not have such a clear menu that was easy and fast to manually switch different modes, settings and speeds etc.  The Panasonic menu is somewhat less intuitive and just not as \"clean\" looking from a graphic/icon perspective.  If you are familiar with smart phones, it's like going from an iPhone to an old Palm menu. But, the Panasonic has a lot more manual user options, which beyond its lesser appealing graphical look, puts more control in the users hands.  Similar to the 8000, there is a quick menu, which is quick to reference, while also having the standard menu of all options.  Also, Panasonic's face detection is much more responsive on the TS1.The \"auto\" mode of the 8000 was terrible.  The majority of pictures taken in auto mode were not up to our standards.  It wasn't until I used the manual features and bumped down the pixels as well as the ISO that the pictures started to look better.  As with many camera's, dark lighting and indoor use resulted in average to poor image quality.  Pictures in good lighting were good.  Regardless, the 8000 always produced soft images, which was its only downside in my opinion.  Which brings me to the TS1.  Much like the 8000, it took some fiddling with the ISO speeds and lighting choices to achieve good to excellent pictures.  However, even in \"auto\" mode the camera takes good pictures even at higher ISO speeds. The details are crisp and clear in good lighting or while using the flash.  The color can even be changed between vivid, standard, natural etc.  These are subtle differences that consumers like myself appreciate and actually can see in the pictures.CONS:Zoom button placementSlow zoomStiff buttonsBattery must be recharged separatelyClumsy access to side compartmentsPROS:Good to excellent image quality (auto or manual)Good indoor image quality with flash and low lightingProduces some crisp imagesHigher optical zoom than similar camerasExcellent face detectionSeveral manual user options", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Rugged Camera.

The Pentax was very reliable and still works perfectly well, but this camera is the only one I'm carrying now.What's good about the Panasonic Lumix TS1 as compared to the Pentax Optio W30:+ 28mm equivalent wide angle.  I found I was shooting 95% of my pictures at the widest end of the Optio (about 35mm) and still often wishing for a wider angle.  The TS1 finally delivers a wide angle.+ Much better image quality than the Pentax.  ISO400 is actually usable now, and I can leave auto ISO on!+ Optical image stabilizer.  Every modern camera has this.+ 720p HD video.  The Pentax only does 640x480 MJPEG that turns into a muddled mess with sensor noise and JPEG artifact.  720p from the TS1 looks great.+ Quiet autofocus and zoom.  The motor can barely be heard in videos if there's no other sound.  Underwater, these sounds are magnified, and you can even hear the image stabilizer working in a quiet spot, but when do you need the sound in an underwater video?+ Quick bootup, fast focus.+ Zoom review option.  This is great--it shows you a zoomed-in view after each photo so you can see if it's actually in focus.+ Separate photo trigger/movie record buttons.+ Good exposure and color balance control.  I can leave everything on auto, with iExposure enabled to help with high dynamic range scenes, and images almost always come out fine.What's not so great:- Lens not very fast, with a maximum aperture of f/3.3 at the wide end that falls off quickly to f/5.9 at the tele end.- Image quality okay, but not great.  12MP is excessive for such a tiny sensor; the lens can't resolve detail at that level anyway--with a 6MP sensor of the same size, this camera could take awesome photos.- No pan focus mode.  I liked that option for underwater shots on my Pentax.  This can be sort of worked around by using autofocus lock, but it's not quite the same thing.- No manual focus at all!- Macro mode has trouble focusing on close-up objects and seems to prefer the background, even with spot focus enabled.  With lack of manual focus, this can be a problem.- No manual aperture/exposure time setting or raw image recording.  I don't believe there's an underwater camera currently made that has these.- Minimum macro range not as good as the Pentax.- Have to hold power button down for one second for camera to power up, needlessly doubling bootup time.- No manual \"turn display on/off\" function.  This is a shame, since the display powerup is very fast.  Automatic power saving choices are limited.- Holding down buttons to scroll a picture has the usual 1-second delay before the key starts repeating that's been in digital devices since forever. It's almost 2010 now and we're all used to pressing keys, can we maybe get this down to a quarter-second like on our computer keyboards?- There's a bug or incompatibility that causes HD video recorded by this camera to be played at double speed by some software.  In Windows, at least Media Player Classic Home Cinema (MPC-HC) plays the videos perfectly.The camera also has tons of \"scene modes\" which I haven't gotten around to playing with.

Audio in videos clicks often if you aren't gentle about releasing the zoom buttons.  The camera dims the audio volume when zooming to avoid picking up motor noises.  This takes much better audio than my old kodak M1033 which distorted easily at concerts.  THIS IS A GREAT CONCERT CAMERA for being tough and being able to pick up LOUD noise without cracking and distorting.2. Lens placement means I am often covering the lens and my pictures have blurry dark spots in the corner.  This is a common anchor point for steady shots.. so I get a lot of finger prints on the lens.3. Sky is often washed out, but I fixed that with some manual tweaks.This takes 720p video (at 59.97 frames per second - verified with sony vegas Pro 9).  I have set my camera to take 16:9 shots even though it takes a few Megapixels off the size it looks great and matches the aspect ratio of new TVs and new monitors.Underwater use has been fun, being waterproof makes it less risky to take places, like kayaking where you aren't there for underwater shots, but there is a high risk of water damage.I have only tested underwater in a lake.  Lakes in Maine are full of minerals (brown/rust colored) so the pics tend to be darkened.  Ocean or pool would be much brighter and less distorted.  I got this camera to take to high risk events like sailing, kayaking, biking and its perfect for the job.  I also use this for filming drum covers, drums are loud, this camera can handle the audio and fast movement in videos.Color tones are beautiful. greens in particular remind me of my first sony, they are deep and eye catching.I have not tested facial recognition, or really any special features but macro.  Macro mode is much better than the olympus tough cameras and my previous kodak M1033. I also like having a dedicated video button versus having to goto a menu or restarting the camera in video mode.Editing video is a breeze with sony vegas, my old kodak took quicktime files which are basically useless on a PC without wasting hours converting video.  You do need a good computer to edit video.  Filesizes of videos is much more manageable then my kodaks 720p videos (the video looks much better too, stays in focus better and adjusts to light changes faster).Someone before this said you need a gaming computer to play HD video.. I disagree. The videos play on my desktop and both of my 3 year old laptops. So, unless you own an eMachines (junk and probably cost less than this camera) or a 4+ year old computer, you probably wont have trouble.  (desktop is dual core 3.0ghz 6GB, laptop 1 is 1.5ghz dual core 2GB, laptop 2 is 2.4ghz single core 1GB).  Its not a fault of the camera if your computer cant handle HD video, HD video takes a lot of processing power no matter what it came from, so clean the background programs out to free it up.I give this camera 5/5 for taking near SLR quality pictures from a point and shoot, especially with macro images.  Waterproof that works, and video quality that is top of the line with compatibility to work with.**FOLLOW UP** Its been almost a year and it has had no issues. Waterproofing has held up fine, Ive tested it in swimming pools now too, and video is crystal clear.  Video editing is now supported by windows movie maker.  Battery life has been great, I bought a spare non-OEM off eBay for $7 and it works fine with the camera.

(no pun intended)", "Author": "L.S. \"L.S.\"", "ReviewID": "RYWCDMM5YQFUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I am an electronics fanatic and normally scour the internet for reviews/research on products before making a purchase.  Never though have I left a review myself, but this time I feel I must due to the great quality of this camera. I am even more compelled to submit a review, since my last camera was the Sony DSC-T500 which can't come close to the Lumix DMC-TS1 on what I consider is one of the most important aspects of a digital camera.First off, the camera is very well built and classy looking.  There is no reason to assume it is a tough/waterproof camera at a glance. It would look just as at home in the water as well as out on the town.  The photos themselves look wonderful and unless you pixel peek and want to make poster size prints, this camera will do just fine.Some of the complaints I have read in other reviews include, no lens cover, only 10ft waterpoof, and 15 minutes max record for video.  First off, no automatic closing lens cover is a good thing in my opinion. Normally when you power down, the lens cover closes. Well consider being at the beach with your new waterproof camera and having a few grains of sand get dragged along between the lens and the lens cover as it closes over them.  I'd much rather deal with cleaning fingerprints than a scratched lens.  Now some will argue that the uncovered lens will get scratched anyways.  Well, keep it in a camera case when not in use, and you should be just fine.As far as the 10ft waterproofing goes, this is plenty deep enough for general swimming, snorkeling, and sudden downpours.  If you plan on using it for scuba diving, there now is an optional deep water case that Panasonic makes for this model that will allow you to go down 140 feet.  While some of the other waterproofs go down 30 feet, they do not have this option let alone any good HD video recording.  Therefore in actuality they are more limited in use than the Panasonic.15 minutes max video record is for European models only due to some E.U. law that would reclassify it as a camcorder which in turn would change the import tax rate on it. Atleast this is what I have read.  I have the U.S. version, and there is no limit as to how long you can record a AVCHD video clip unless obviously you run out of memory. By the way, the video looks great on my Panasonic Plasma tv through both the HDMI connection and the SD card reader on my bluray player which does recognize AVCHD video.Now one of the most important aspects of a camera besides photo quality is battery life.  Obviously without batteries, even the very best digital cameras are nothing more than a paperweight.  As a comparison, my Sony DSC-T500 with its actally very nice 3.5\" touch screen is a battery hog.  After fully charging a battery, I would get an average 30-50 photos along with appox. 10-15 minutes max of AVCHD video before the battery was drained.  Those large touchscreens are terrible for batteries and in my opinion, harder to navigate through than standard buttons. Now in comparison, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS1 was MUCH MUCH better. I started with a full battery and was able to get on only 1 charge -- 75 photos with flash, 75 photos without flash, full zoom cycle 100 times and 90 minutes of AVCHD video set at the highest settings. I was using a Transcend 16gb sdhc card.  This alone makes this camera 100% better than the Sony. Not to mention the photo quality is better, it uses cheaper priced easier to find sdhc cards and has the HDMI and A/V ports built into the camera instead of having to use a docking station for these features.It really is a great camera for everyday use as well as slightly more extreme situations.  While not as small as some of the other Panasonic cameras, it is still very pocketable.

After now having the camera for a few days, and taking lots of photos I can say that this camera offers some great features in a very well made camera that makes this one stand out.I am an avid DSLR user, and this camera does all the things that my Nikon DSLR doesn't:1. Shoot 720p video (or any video at all for that matter). The video is stunning. If you are looking at low end \"flash camcorders\" forget it, get this.2. Take it underwater or shoot in the rain.3. Throw it a bag and take wherever you go, or stick it in your pocket (Put it in a camera case to protect expose outer glass over lense)4. Can bang it around (shockproof), though I don't recommend using that feature, just good to know it can take a lick...5. Option to record a 5 second audio clip to accompany your still photos (I love this feature, especially when shooting photos for work)6. Record to internal memory (called the \"clipboard\"). Good for not mixing those \"photo documentation\" shots with your normal recreational photos7. Hook up directly to HDTV via HDMI cable (sold separately).  See more on this feature below.The only cameras that I found to compare to this in the $300 range were the Sanyo Xacti CA9 (HD), the Canon D10 (non-HD), and the Olympus Stylus 8000 (non-HD). I decided that the Sanyo CA9 was going to be a junkier unit than the Panasonic, with lesser image quality and features.  The Canon and the Olympus don't shoot HD video (which was a deal-breaker for me).  The Canon is a lot bulkier due to its better waterproofing than the TS1 (10m vs. 3m).  I was just looking for a snorkel cam, not a diving cam, so I'd rather not have the bulk. I have never been a fan of Olympus, especially due to their proprietary memory cards (xD).  The zoom range on the Panasonic is, I think, superior to these other cameras, especially due to its true wide angle capability.  I also have owned Panasonic and Canon digital cameras, and find the Panasonic beats the Canon in ease of use.  The TS1 allows optical zoom while shooting video, Canon's typically do not.The AVCHD format for the video seems very good.  I think Sony and Panasonic developed this format so that you could fit a good amount of HD video per stored gigabyte of memory space.  A lot of users seem to have trouble with this format since it is not well supported on the PC, and you'll have to use the included Panasonic software, which probably isn't all that great, or buy a software like Sony Vegas.  I use a Mac which is fully compatible with the AVCHD format without loading any other software. Just attach the camera, and iMovie imports the videos quickly and it ready to edit them, and convert to post to the internet. If you area  PC user, you probably have to figure on buying Vegas in order to manage the videos off this camera. This camera can be your camcorder - easily.  I know it's not 1080p, but I am of the opinion that 720p is way better than 480p, and not much less than 1080p.  Keep in mind that the higher the resolution, the bigger the hard drive and more computing time you're going to need to deal with it.  720p hits the sweet spot, at this time.And as I mentioned earlier, the hookup to an HDTV is accomplished via a separately sold mini-HDMI to HDMI cable.  This is a non-proprietary cable, so you can easily pick one up at Amazon for less than $10.  A really cool thing that I found out by surprise was whenI plugged it into my Panasonic Viera Plasma HDTV.  Once plugged in, you actually operate the camera to play photos, movies, etc. using the TV remote (that's right, the TV remote, right from the comfort of your couch). No one else has this type of a feature on a digital camera.Also, it was great that Amazon included a FREE 4GB Class4 memory card with the purchase, which I will now use with my Nikon D40 (sorry, Amazon!) to replace a slow 1GB card I had in there.  I'm using a Transcend 16GB Class 6 card I purchased for the TS1, which can store a little more than 2 hours of 720p HD video on the single card.So if you're looking for a great hybrid HD movie camera, the TS1 will not disappoint.  The controls are well built and easy to operate.  If you don't have a pocket cam to complement your DSLR, you should, because you're missing out on a lot of photo opportunities.  And if you're going to get a camera or camcorder, you should be looking for one that offers the quality of HD video. And when you can get all this and take it in the water with you, you have a VERY versatile camera that will do so much more than your old cameras did.I do have one negative item to point out on this camera.  With most cameras, when you review the shot you took, you can quickly hit a button or two and delete the photo while still in shooting mode.  Not so, with the Panasonic.  You have to go into review mode, and then hit three buttons to delete the photo.  A bit annoying.  Other than that, I really don't find any other problems with the camera yet.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "An all around camera", "Author": "Fulbert T.

I finally decided on the TS1 for my all around camera and the camera to bring for my vacation to Hawaii.Here's the pros and cons i encountered now that I've had it for 2 months.  I won't go into detail about photo quality since you can get that info on other digital camera reviews sites.  But I can say that my photos have turned out great especially if you know what this camera excels at.Pros+ durable enough to take on hikes and to the beach without worry.+ takes great photos and videos underwater+ HD video+ wide angle shots.+ 5x zoom+ no issue w/ battery life (lasts all day and night)+ multitude of manual options and scenery choices+ has point and shoot setting for the photo challenged+ doesn't look like an underwater cameraCons- Maintenance, if you take it underwater you have to before hand make sure no particles on the camera's doors, ie lint, and/or dirt. But that is to be expected when you purchase an underwater camera.- seals do seem like it needs to be a bit thicker but i never had a problem w/ water getting to the battery compartment even after a week of constant drenching in the ocean either snorkeling, or kayaking. I did however clean it everyday if used in the ocean as per the instruction.- the zoom button isn't in the best spot (in front of the capture button) and I wasn't thrilled that it was a slider type.I highly recommend this camera if you need it for a vacation and also one that you can use everyday.  It's not perfect but against the other cameras in its class, this one has all you will need.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "More Than I Expected", "Author": "Kailua Steve", "ReviewID": "R229U2FIFSXSDX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Lumix. We have a more expensive LX-2 -- top of the line in its time -- which is an excellent almost-pocketable camera. I also bought a cheaper FZ-28 for hiking, which is disappointingly noisy. This camera is /very/ nice for what it is. It's smaller than I expected, which is a good thing. It's also lighter than I expected. It's not a tank, like some of the Olympus cameras. [I'm neutral whether that is good or bad.] It tends to flare some since the lens is covered by a piece of flat glass with no sun shade, but as long as you watch where the sun is, that's not a big problem. I have gotten it wet while hiking but haven't yet taken it underwater. There are lots of YouTube videos from people who have. I expected the door for the battery and SD card to have some kind of lock on it (like the Sanyo waterproofs) so one doesn't accidentally open it underwater. If someone made a camera condom for this model, I'd probably use it just to cover the door. It exposure brackets only +/- 1 E.V.; I'd prefer 2 so I could shoot HDRs when the situation requires it.But it takes _wonderful_ video. The raw video on a large screen television is gorgeous. It has a nice wide lens, adjusts focus and exposure quickly (and in small increments). I use AVCHD Lite with a Mac. The first time I used it as a videocam was at a dog show. I posted the results on YouTube under \"Beck - Best of Breed.\" Most recently I shot \"Moanalua Valley Trail - After the Rain\" with it. I'm very pleased with its macro capability too. I bought the green color; it's subtle and doesn't look cheap or industrial. It's rugged enough that it gets used a lot. Although I bought a second battery, the battery for this camera is not a skinny little toy. I've never had an issue with the first battery running down but I tend not to use a flash.I'd recommend this camera if you regularly do any kind of outdoor activities and take an extra second or two to see where the sun is relative to the camera.", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for what it is....", "Author": "J.

It was very compact and worked as described in water or out, but the image quality and quirky video mode was too much for me.The Canon D10 was very good.  My only complaint there was with it's size, battery life and lack of HD videos.I finally turned to the Panasonic TS1.  I've been very impressed with the IQ in and out of the water thus far.  It does a very good job as an every day, carry around camera.  The IQ rivals typical compact P&S; cameras.  The bonus here is the video mode.  Outstanding video from such a small camera.  This one is a keeper.  Very good battery life as well.The truth is that none of these cameras is going to be as good as a normal compact P&S;, but the Panasonic comes the closest and does the job quite nicely.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good for what it is", "Author": "B.

The TS1 is pretty pricey at $400, but it is fairly feature packed.  The video mode actually works quite well, and the AVCHD compression is exceptionally good.  This is really the main stand-out feature of this camera because the general image quality of the still shots is pretty marginal, but still in-line with what you'd typically get with these kinds of cameras.  There is a fair amount of JPEG artifacting, and I don't know why for $400 this thing can't save out RAW.  It really should.The auto controls work reasonably well, but there is only fair manual control.  There's also no lens cover of any type, and this doesn't come with a case.  For the price, it should have a case since it seems too easy to scratch the glass over the lens.I bought this to take kayaking, rafting, and on hikes where carrying my Canon 450D would be a pain.  I don't expect the best images, but most of the flaws of the files can be fixed simply by importing the JPEG's into Photoshop's Camera RAW importer and tweaking the whitebalance et.al. there.For what it is, I like the camera, but you'll never get professional shots out of this or any other camera with a  1 cm lens.  That tiny lens means you'll have to deal with slow shutter speeds and high ISO's, so you'll get grainy, blurry images.

It is small and tough enough to carry anywhere, and the pictures it takes in good light are just unbelievable; no distortion, low to no noise, and super sharpness and near HDR looking range. It boggles my mind that a camera with folded optics can work this well. But there are two bonuses I couldn't have expectedOne, it has a phenomenal macro mode. It takes just lovely pictures of objects as small as 1cm in size, and viewing the pictures on a large screen shows near-microscopic details. Plus, the lens position allows for ant's eye view pictures by just holding the camera upside down and using the in camera photo editing (!) to rotate the resulting picture.Then, there is the HD video. . .on the sharpest AVCHD mode, the video is just unbelievable. Many full sized camcorders from just a few years ago are no match for this tiny marvel. Further, unlike the TZ5 the continuous auto focus actually works, and is not distracting or headache inducing on play back. It does produce a tiny bit of servo noise, so if you want the best audio it's still best to turn CAF off. On my sample the audio is good, not great; it would be nice if it had a microphone port, but you can't have everything. It even takes -macro video-, a unique feature. I have a video up on Vimeo of a test of the macro video capabilities; it might be worth taking a look at if you are interested in the video capabilities of this camera.[...]Overall recommendation; buy it!

I decided to take it snorkeling at the hotel beach the day before our excursion to try it out, and that was the end of it.I was very careful to check and make sure the doors were properly secured, and there was no foreign matter on the gaskets.  I rinsed it off properly and let it dry.  Once I opened the battery compartment door, I knew why the camera wasn't working, as there was water inside.

So far so good.  I've taken this camera into salt water at least 50 times with no problems.  The more I use this camera the more I like it.  For video I've been using the motion jpeg setting instead of AVCHD which seems easier to edit.  For regular photos the quality is what you'd expect from a point and shoot camera.  What I like most about this camera besides it being waterproof and rugged is the wide angle lens.  This camera has turned out to be my favorite of the half dozen or so digital cameras that I've owned over the past few years.

But when the camera is powered up, the camera displays a message that the battery cannot be used, then powers off.----------Added September 14.The Lowepro Ridge 30 case is a good fit to the TS-1. The case easily holds the camera and wrist strap, two or three extra batteries in the pocket with the Velcro flap, and several memory cards in the zippered pocket.The case has a belt loop to... er... put the case on your belt.

I went with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS1 because of its size and its ability to shoot 720P AVCHD video. The camera took great photos and very good video and I would highly recommend it as a durable outdoor digital camera. However, it is simply NOT capable of being used underwater reliably. The doors on the device for accessing the battery, SD card, and HDMI port are simple \"snap\" doors. It needs some type of clamp system to create a better seal. The very first time I used it underwater, it leaked and the camera broke. Luckily, I was still within my return period, so I returned it for a full refund. There are other underwater cameras that are better constructed for underwater use, but they don't have the feature set of the Lumix DMC-TS1.

Hoy \"NateHoy\"", "ReviewID": "R15L82WJ8BCDSQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Image quality in bright light is really excellent, flash is very good for a camera of this size and class, and the waterproofing does the job (took a few pictures from underwater in the kitchen sink the first day, figuring if I ruined it in water I'd better do it early).  Response time is very good, camera is loaded with features (and the facial recognition works surprisingly well).PRO: - Waterproof (which was the primary reason I bought it). - Better than average battery life (lasted about a week of light use). - Macro mode is really impressive, though the flash can \"white out\" the macro really easily if you're not careful composing your shot. - Nice wide angle lens.  You don't know how handy that is until you convert to a wide angle camera. - No external moving parts.  I like that in a ruggedcam. - Big, beautiful, bright screen and easy controls. - Build quality:  Doors are all nice latched things with spring hinges, waterproof seals look really good, all nice alumimum with very little plastic. - 720p video.  It's da bomb.  Even casual clips of stuff look really good.  Not \"BBC Planet Earth\" good, but far better than a camera this size seems like it should be capable of.  Audio is relatively clear, and the images are just amazing. - Picture quality.  Wow.  Just... wow.  In outdoor light (even clouds) images are just, well, astonishingly good.  Crisp, clear, colors seem good. - Obviously replaceable gaskets on the doors.  Because stuff wears out.  No idea how much replacements cost, but the current gaskets are well-made and look durable, and any damage to them is going to be visible.NEUTRAL: - Exposed lens.  Torn on this one, because I don't want moving parts in a ruggedcam, but I'd like the lens protected when not in use.  It is nicely recessed and seems durable, so I'll mark this as a \"neutral\" - Large and heavy for the \"teeny camera\" class.  But then again, it's waterproof and needs to be rugged, and you need a little extra heft.  It dwarfs my Elph, but still fits in a pocket easily.  For the \"small waterproof\" class, this does well. - MTS video default.  I disliked this at first, until I learned that Linux Mint supports the video format easily (it just doesn't like the file extension, so I had to associate that with a video player).  With the right codecs (right in the repositories), all of the popular Linux video editors had no problem loading it, editing it, and transcoding it to anything I wanted.CON: - Indoor photography is a tad noisier than I had hoped without flash use.  Not terrible, but not as good as I had hoped.  Image stabilization seems to work pretty well, though.  It's better than my old Elph, so I'll give credit where credit is due for a tiny camera like this with a small lens. - Connector on the camera side is not USB.  C'mon, guys.  I know the connector has other uses than USB, but put a USB-Micro or USB-Mini port on the camera.All in all, it's a great all-around camera, and it's almost a bonus that it's waterproof, even though I bought it primarily for that reason (I kayak quite a bit, and want something I can just strap to my PFD and not have to tuck in a bag every time I want to roll).  It responds well, the controls are relatively simple, it has decent 2-3 keypress shortcuts for a lot of the features, and it certainly looks like they knew what they were doing when they built it.If you want a waterproof camera, reviews are split between this and the Olympus D-10.

However, I did not want to spend the money if I was going to be getting a camera that could not really be used for normal everyday use with friends, family, pets, etc.  I was very concerned that it was even possible, because I had been reading reviews on other cameras and there was a lot of mention of compromised image quality.  I had read great reviews on the Canon d10, but the camera was a little bulky when I saw it in person, for a camera that I wanted to bring everywhere with me, or slip in my pocket or purse.I decided to pay the extra money for this camera, and I'm glad that I did.  The images come out great above water, and the HD video is solid.  Even my brother commented that the pictures looked really great, when using my camera at a family event.  I also used this camera at the beach (the water in CA is a bit murky for any clear pictures) and filming my brother swimming (so he can look at what he needs to work on).  The camera worked great above and under water, and the video looks clean.  Underwater photos don't look 100% sharp like above-water pictures do, but honestly, if I showed someone the picture, they would never notice.One comment I noticed in other reviews was that the buttons were a little small  or closely placed, but I haven't really had a big problem with that.I got the green camera.

This far, we owned 6 digital cameras, everything from ultra compact to a larger size body - from cheap to moderately expensive. I don't think we will ever use all the features but it's great to browse through them and get to learn them. There are also two demo video's on the camera to demonstrate some of the features on the go.Due to the small size, the flash isn't as powerful as with larger cameras. Just something you have to deal with with any compact or ultra compact cameras. The other thing is that the lens doesn't have a cover, meaning there is always a chance that some finger smudges are on the lens when you take it out of your pocket.It's very easy to switch between picture mode and taking movies, just press the movie record button while in picture mode. I love this feature, there is no fiddling around with buttons to switch from one to the other. However, the one thing I couldn't figure out yet is to display the length of the movie while you are recording instead of posting the remaining maximum time you have for recording the movie. That would be nice to find since that helps to determine the movie size.

For the features that it has, the waterproofing, and the video quality it was a knock out for me. Now, for those of you who have been looking up the specs on this camera, it says that you can record 720p at 30fps. Actually I have run multiple tests and the version that I got runs at 60fps (I got a Class 10 SDHC card though so I am not sure if the speed of the card matters or not). I have heard mixed reviews about this and some people say it runs at 30 some people say it runs at 60, so I would imagine if you bought a fast SDHC card then you could probably record at 60 as well. It really looks incredible too. The video roughly in SH mode runs about 22 to 26 mbps. Which is pretty uncompressed. The pictures are really really good as well. The only thing I will say is if you are expecting this camera to blow you away with pictures, then you have to be in a good lit area. The macro is absolutely astounding though, it truly is as good as they say, you can almost get just a few mm away from a subject and still take a clear, high def picture. For me, just the ability of the waterproofing, video options, and the Ai photo capabilities I was sold on this camera. This also is round 2 or 3 ( I cant remember) for Panasonic doing a waterproof camera and it really shows.

I've had it for months and have really abused it.  It's been dropped, squashed and dunked more times than I'd like to admit.

There's not much of a zoom but I was more interested in the wide angle, which is as advertised. I compensate for the limited zoom by shooting all pics at 12MP and blowing them up later as needed.Movies are okay but don't expect it to compare to a dedicated HD camcorder. The video quality is very good but the \"stabilization\" is limited and the zoom feature does not pan in and out slowly and smoothly; it has one zoom speed - fast. Bottom line, the HD video component is a great bonus feature on a very nice compact waterproof still camera, nothing more.The rechargeable battery seems to last forever, even when shooting videos, but I do carry a backup for long trips. If you plan on taking many videos get a couple of SD cards of at least 8GB.All in all, I am very pleased.

It has held up admirably! With temperature changes, the camera lens does tend to fog up a bit. Sometimes a simple wipe across the lens cover works, but other times the build-up is inside and there's not much you can do except dry it off and let it sit with the battery door open for a bit. I think this is most noticeable when there are big differences in water and air temperatures! (duh!)anyways, it's been great and the video is fantastic. it's strange why the video seems to come out so impressive, but the pictures seem to be relatively at par or just a few hairs below normal point-and-shoot cameras. though, for waterproof/shockproof units, it is head and shoulders above the rest.One problem I had when I first purchased the unit is that the video function would keep stopping. It meant sometimes I could only take 15 sec clips and other times maybe 3-4 minutes.  It was hard to tell why that happened, but now I'm always a bit afraid that it's going to turn off in the middle of a recording and so am not prone to leave the unit recording (i.e. on a tripod) without having to constantly keep checking on it.  It seems to be better now, but I'm still a bit nervous about that.  Anyone else have this problem?Other thing is that I bring a big ziploc bag with me when I travel to soak the camera in freshwater after I've been in the ocean (this is recommended in the manual). It keeps salt deposits from building up in the nooks and crannies (i.e. around the buttons and openings) when the seawater dries off.I had a quick question for other owners about recommending SDHC cards.I want to take as long and continuous HD video footage as possible with this camera.1) What is the largest card and what speed do you recommend (class 4? class 6? 15mb/s?)?2) What is the maximum length of time you have been able to record in one clip? (I want to be able to record a 1-4 hour series of presentations without having to constantly check the camera.)I recommend the camera to anyone who wants to take good portable videos (we're talking much better than youtube - but you have to find a good converter to go from MTS to other formats) and needs the ruggedness this unit offers!

However on a shore dive (only the third vacation of using the Panasonic camera and housing), the housing leaked allowing water in the case.  The shore dive was fairly shallow, no greater than 30 feet.When I returned to the resort from the dive, I quickly removed the camera from the housing that was 1/2 full of water.  I rinsed the camera off with tap water to rid the salt water.  I let the camera air out for 24 hours before reassessing.  I expected the camera to turn on, when it failed to turn on I was shocked.  This is the first time the camera ever came in contact with water and it was while it was in the marine housing.

A peculiarity to this model is that I have to hold down the rather small On/Off button for about 2 seconds to get it to turn on, yet only have to tap the button to turn it off.The biggest cons are the amount of noise, the color quality in lower light or indoor pictures, and that the back screen gets scratched and smudged when I keep it in my purse. Accurate color correction on my computer (I use iPhoto) is generally hard to do for low-light pictures because of the poor color information and amount of noise. Minor issues for me are that it connects to my computer via USB but doesn't charge through it, and that it is often uncomfortable to hold.I haven't tested the water resistance or the seals. Even though battery life hasn't been a problem, I plan to buy an extra battery to keep charge and swap out when I need to, just in case. Overall, I am happy with the camera, but do feel that it is over-priced for what it does.

I found I was doing more and more short video clips of the kids, so I wanted a camera that would take high def video and good birthday and wedding kind of photos, but also a camera that I could take fishing or boating and not worry about it getting damp.  After lugging around a lot of camera bags, I also wanted something that would easily go into a jacket pocket.I really wasn't looking at Panasonic, but in searches and reviews this camera just kept coming up over and over.  Being on the higher end of the cost range in relation to stated features, I got this with some trepidation, but I've had this camera for about 4 months, I've taken hours and hours of video and thousands of photos, and I have to say it has been a great buy.  I have taken a few underwater photos, just to see if it worked, but I don't think I'd take it diving....overall, I have no regrets.The Pros:Great video and picture quality.Very good battery life and reasonably priced extra batteries.Shock proof - I have \"tested\" this feature on more than one occasion.Video screen quality.Very good image stabilizationPre-set \"scene\" modes that make sense and actually work.Relatively easy to use menus and buttons.The Cons:No view finder...not really a con once you get used to it and battery life is good even with the big screen on all the time.The outer metal case is tough, but it dents and scratches pretty easily, more cosmetic than anything else.The recessed lens is great for shockproofing....hard to clean.Fair to adequate sound quality.

I know there is a lot of discussion about just how waterproof it is or isn't, but I gotta say... mine has worked just fine from kayaking, to pool parties, to swimming in the ocean.  I did get a little fog inside the lens at the beach, which probably isn't a good thing, but it went away and still works just fine.  I think as long as you are very thorough when checking the seals before you close it when changing the battery or SD card, it will be as waterproof as they advertise.  Now I'm not ruling out the possibility of defects. So I guess it may be a lottery situation like with many electronic devices.As far as picture and video quality... obviously not the BEST, but definitely great for what the camera is designed for and the price.  The pictures are a little washed out sometimes (not all the time), and the audio on the video is definitely lacking (once it's gone underwater your lucky to hear anything unless you tip it upside down and tap the water out of the mic holes), but considering digital cameras this size even 5 years ago shot medium quality video (at best), it is a very good camera.Obviously there will be improvements in the world of compact waterproof cameras in the years to come, but for right now, I don't think you can ask for anything better for this price.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome little camera", "Author": "LgT", "ReviewID": "R3UDUKARLJJ8O1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera primarily for its ruggedness and underwater capability. Did extensive research and decided this camera offered the best combination of image quality, features, and design out of all the \"rugged\" cameras I looked at. I already own a Nikon D40 DSLR and several lenses for the times when I need serious image quality and flexibility, but if I'm going to trade off capability for portability with a compact camera, it would be nice to get some new capabilities in exchange, and this camera delivers.Image quality is decent for a compact. Not anywhere as good as a DSLR, but certainly better than a lot of Sony and Olympus models I looked at, which smudge every last ounce of fine detail into what looks like a water painting. I usually shoot mine at the 5MP setting to save on memory capacity, and I don't see much difference between this and the 12MP resolution. There's just no way this tiny lens and sensor will capture 12MP worth of detail, not even close to my 6MP DSLR. The bonus of this option is the extended zoom feature, which uses only the center portion of the sensor, thus allowing me to zoom in closer without degradation in image quality, unlike regular digital zoom.Some other notable features I like:-relatively fast auto-focus for a compact-usable zoom range, starting at a moderately wide 28mm equivalent focal length-optical image stabilization-easy exposure compensation-\"intelligent exposure\" to tame the highlights and shadows in high contrast scenes-macro shooting-adjustable white balance (no fluorescent preset, but can set custom WB using a white/gray card)-variety of scene modes, including long exposure and lower-rez high speed burst (about 7fps)-dedicated button for HD video recording with optical zooming and image stabilization-nice-looking design, doesn't resemble a plastic toy cameraThe waterproof capability seems to hold up just fine. I submerged the camera in my sink, and saw no problems. Also took it on a wet and wild boat ride where it got splashed with salt water as I was filming video, then washed it off under a faucet when I got home, and the camera performed without a hiccup.Overall, I'm fairly happy with this camera, and the price is very reasonable for the capabilities it offers.

I like the \"iA\" feature which automatically selects a scene mode based on what the camera sees.  It works pretty well for most conditions and helps you get good shots without having to mess with settings.  The start-up time is also very good.  Taken together, these features mean I could whip it out and grab a shot at a moment's notice (which is important in a snapshot camera).  My favorite feature, though, is the wider angle lens.  I was really surprised how much more you can fit in a shot with it.  It actually takes some getting used to as you have to either move closer or use the (very adequate) zoom to get close enough to see people's faces.  It's much better than the old \"scoot in a little closer\" while backing up to try to get everything in the picture.

One thing I like better than my old canon cameras, is that the flash doesn't seem as powerful, so I don't end up with whitewashed pictures. Getting the video to work was a little tricky, but then I didn't read the user manual. ;)", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it so far.", "Author": "DanC", "ReviewID": "R25OLB8598NKTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, I'll submit this now even though I have not yet used all aspects of the camera, like the video option.  So keep that in mind.  Anyway, I have a Pentax DSLR and it's great.  But sometimes you just don't want to carry it and the lenses around.  So with an excursion to Chicago coming up I gave in and bought the TS1.  Due to my bad habits of kayaking, sailing, cycling and just being outside a whole lot it had to be a water resistant (\"proof\" is a big word) camera.  This seemed to be the best combination of protection from the elements, portability, and picture quality for me.  I hate tons of menus, \"options\", and clicking!  Good for me that a short go over of the instructions was all I needed to get on my way.  I found the menus easy to deal with and sensible when I wanted them.  First time using it was in Chicago walking around at night.  I had read some bad reviews on low light performance from this camera so oh well I thought.  Holy cow the pics looked amazing!  Now this is in the city with lit up buildings and such but still night.  The detail and evenness across the photos really surprised me, in a good way.  These were all taken hand held so we can assume the motion stabilization works well.  Color was also excellent.  Next day, cold as crap but full sun.  Again the pics look great.  The viewer was easy to see even with the bright day.  Also did well at a snowy mountain bike race later on.  Fun.  Inside was good as well.  I did find the auto white balance seemed to have some trouble with some types of lighting.  But this is not a big deal in my opinion.  One it was not that bad, and I put my pics into the computer and can doctor them some anyway.  A little tweaking and they look just right.  I do this with my DSLR too by the way, I'm sure most of us do.  One big factor for me; this camera has a wider lens than some of the others, 28 rather than 35mm.  You won't be sorry you've got the wider angle.  I found the camera to be very user friendly.  Of course I read the reviews and wondered about all the negative things that where said.  But remember the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  Also I think some people tend to compare it to a thousand dollar DSLR or something. Well it's not that.  Remember, we want to carry it in our pockets and call them \"point and shoots\".  Short is I love this thing so far.  It's a lot of easy to carry and use fun and looks great.  Sorry to not have got in under water or used the video yet, maybe we'll expound on that later.

You'll save yourself a lot of time and frustration.The camera takes mediocre pictures and does seem to be waterproof and shockproof, as advertised.  The (slightly) extended zoom is useful - IF you can get the auto focus to work.  Auto Focus doesn't work in any sort of low contrast situation - a cloudy day with snow covering the ground, for instance.  One would expect that selecting \"Landscape\" mode would fix the focus on infinity, but it doesn't.  Don't bother looking for a manual focus.  Panasonic left this commonly available feature out.  Even if the camera did focus in snowy weather, the controls are near impossible to operate with gloves on.  The camera CAN record audio - but only during a movie or 5 seconds at a time when you take a picture.  Panasonic left the audio only recording  feature out too.  The form factor is also a problem and I've ruined many a picture getting a finger partially over the lens which, by the way, has no external cover when the camera is off.Battery life is poor in my experience.  So you need to buy a second battery.  Buyer beware !!!  Panasonic has sabotaged the camera by planting a logic bomb in the camera programming making it impossible to use any battery not manufactured and sold by Panasonic.  Users of other batteries - even ones with the correct electrical characteristics - will see the message \"You cannot operate the camera with this battery\" and the camera will shut down.  Expect to pay a premium for a spare battery - if you can find one at all, availability being another Panasonic problem.If you're buying the camera for AVCHD Lite video, patience is required.  Panasonic could have chosen to make this the best feature of the camera, instead the included software makes actually using or backing up video a long, confusing, frustrating slog.  Panasonic claims their camera is suitable for use with a 500 MHz computer.  It is - but you can't play video.  I'm using a 1.76 GHz processor and can only play at 10 fps.  The fine print requires a 2.16 GHz dual core for the video the work, so if you don't have one of the latest in processors, expect disappointing results.If you're new to AVCHD and expect to drag and drop your movies like the more standard .mov  file - forget it!  AVCHD movies must be saved in a strict hierarchical directory structure to play at all.  Complicating matters is that the camera itself uses another format to store the videos and conversion must be done during acquisition using the software that comes with the camera.  The software Panasonic included is apparently prone to getting clobbered by other applications in the Windows  XP environment.  I've had to reinstall several times as error messages flagging lost CODEC's and .dll files randomly appear after days or weeks of normal operation.  There's a panorama maker which makes good looking panoramas - at extremely low resolution - nowhere near suitable for actually printing.  There's two other photo editing programs which seemed generous to me until I figured out I needed one to acquire the videos and the second one to actually edit them.The software is buggy.  The ArcSoft Media Impressions application window spilled off the bottom of the monitor.  All the function buttons were invisible because they were at the bottom of the window, below the bottom of the monitor.  You can't point and click to resize when you can't see the lower window border, and the ALT - Space menu had no effect.  The very basic window resize function simply didn't work.  The program couldn't be used owing to a programming blunder of astonishing magnitude.  A different \"View\" option brought the functions to where they were usable - but then other things disappeared off the bottom of the screen.  MediaImpressions also tendes to take up 100% of the CPU cycles even when it is idle.  I've had to use the task manager more than once to kill it.  The Panasonic PhotoFun application was oft times confusing due, apparently, to lack of familiarity with the English language.  Having figured all that out, I found there were some recorded videos that simply refused to be acquired or played.  The camera could play the videos all the way through, so the information was there, but PhotoFun could not acquire them, could not even see them on the SD card.  Near as I can tell, these videos are effectively lost.  If you're going to take videos that absolutely, positively can not be lost, another product is recommended.  According to some online forums, many have simply thrown away the included software and gone out and paid more money for software that had some actual utility.I wouldn't buy this camera if I had known.

I took the pictures with only my head underwater.  The next day I noticed condensation in the camera itself.  So much for it being waterproof.  The SD memory card still had the pictures on it so I was able to salvage them but the camera was useless.  Amazon was great at exchanging it so I try another one which I have yet to be able to do.  The camera did work just fine for taking pictures while kayaking and it did survive one dunk in the ocean.  Note:  The camera will not float so I bought a floating collar which worked well.As a digital camera it takes very good pictures.  The software takes a bit to get used to, just like all modern digital cameras.  The camera is not \"fast\" in that you have to leave some time for \"recovery\" in between pictures.  I'm using very fast rated SD card so it's not the memory that is the issue.  My one gripe is that there is no cover for the lens so scratches are going to eventually an issue.  There is no viewfinder which I kind of miss so you have to rely on the LCD display which is very viewable.

I currently own a Canon Powershot G10 and a Canon 40D digital SLR and have been very happy with the great image quality of my Canon cameras.  The thing I like about the Panasonic Lumix is that it takes very nice HD video both on land and in the swimming pool.  The video motion is very smooth and the colors are very accurate.  I also like the compact size of the camera and the very well designed wrist strap.  I liked the wrist strap so much that I ordered an additional one through Panasonic to use on my Canon G10.  Almost everything else about this camera, I find that it is inferior to my Canon G10 and  that it is not a good choice if this is the only camera you own.It is very difficult to take a sharp photo with this camera due to its poor image stabilization, poor indoor lighting performance, hard to hold camera steady while pressing the shutter button due to its small size, poor computer auto white balance.  Almost half of all the pictures I take end up blurry.  The menu system on the Panasonic camera is poorly designed and counterintuitive.  My Canon G10 is a really pleasure to navigate through the menu system and making setting changes before taking the photo.  Battery life on the Panasonic is poor especially if you take video.  The video while it has great image quality is difficult to work with as most computer will stuggle with editing the AVCHD format.  This format requires a computer with the latest processors and lots and lots of memory.  Indoor pictures if taken without flash are basically useless as the images are grainy and blurry.

What they forgot to mention you is that this camera if for any reason at all falls even within the 5 feet the guarantee, it will void the waterproof warranty if you dont send it back for inspection prior to dunk it underwater . What kind of warranty is this? I was not happy with that . It also states that you need to take it every year for the sealant replacement to ensure the camera is still capable of going underwater. This is a camera that requires lots of maintenance . Also the picture quality is blurry at times and in low light conditions is horrible. I did like the part that if you want to take pictures the optical zoom increases without sacrificing picture quality but the picture quality to begin with is not that great. HD recording however was a little nice but it wont record at 60 frames per second which i think its really a turn off because fish underwater move really fast and you dont want that ghosting effect while recording fast moving things. The camera is kinda bulky and the construction is not as strong as the olympus waterproof cameras. The battery compartment tends to leak if you are not really careful, I think this is a major problem with the camera because there's been lots of reports of people complaining about the camera leaking and breaking even after following the instructions given on the owner's manual. The idea was good but since this is the very first camera that panasonic releases , I suggest for you to wait for the next upcoming model to see if they improve all those flaws from this camera. I know the new camera coming in april will have better construction and will be 14.1mp . Hopefully they will fix all those bugs from the AI setting and add 60 frames per second to their recording .
