{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great pocket cam", "Author": "Alonzo", "ReviewID": "R2RYYK942X62IR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with my C663. It does everything I hoped it would do. The size is great for my hands -- bigger than the tiny-tiny cameras, which I have trouble holding. (I'm a guy, but my hands aren't huge. I marvel that people manage those pintsized cams.) The bulge on the right really helps me grip the device.It powers up fast. Batteries last a good long while, and it's nice that it takes AAs. As far as I can tell, Kodak makes the friendliest interfaces of any digicam maker -- you're up and running in no time. I tend to shoot a lot of pix, then put the camera away for a while, then pick it up again. So I love it that Kodak makes this thing so easy to use that I'm not forever going back to the manual to refresh my memory.Movie mode was a big selling point for me. I was waiting until cheap pocket cams came along that could do MPEG4 compression and 30 fps. It was worth the wait. Movie mode on this thing is fine, and very fun. Nothing like a high-quality videocamera, but more than adequate for viewing in a good sized window on a computer. Sound quality is surprisingly good. And, with the MPEG4 compression, I can fit something like a half-hour of video on my 1GB SD card. That's great. I just drag the files off the card onto the Mac, and have a nice time storing them there and/or editing in iMovie, where they behave perfectly well.I can't emphasize enough what a change this makes in video-taking. Very easy to take the camera out on the golf course, for instance -- just tuck it in a pocket and pull it out to shoot your buds taking swings or horsing around. Try that with a traditional videotape camera. Video becomes much more casual and easygoing than we're used to. Being able to take video any time you have a small camera with you is amazing. You wind up with a lot of fun video footage you wouldn't have gotten otherwise -- casual stuff, things that just appealed to you, friends and family. No hauling around the giant camcorder. (And even small videtape cameras look big and complicated next to this thing.) In a year or two quality will be even better, but the quality has now become good enough, at least for my purposes.I'm trying to think of anything I don't like about the C663 and can't come up with much. It's a little plasticky, I guess, but not in a way that bugs me. I'd love to be able to zoom while shooting video. That's about it. The C663 is, IMHO, a terrific little EZ-to-use, point and shoot (and then some) device. All in all, mucho bang for the buck, and god knows it sells for a great price. Hard to beat.", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "I like Kodak for user friendliness", "Author": "I. Katsman \"ikatsman\"", "ReviewID": "R1UHFNKFOEAHCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like Kodak's User Interface. This is a 2nd Kodak I bought (1st -- c340). The multi-point button was better on c340, as now it's sharp edges irritate your finger when used to browse pics too long. It's the only usability drawback I found.Another good point -- Kodak has great support. I had problem with my c340 and it was serviced (warranty) and mailed back to me in 1 week. Much better than Sony(90 day warranty) or Pentax(2 months in service) experiences I had.Camera's response is fast-- power-up time is under 2sec., easy to navigate and set-up. Use of AA- type of batteries is a plus and Ni-MH rechargables are cheap. Battery life is very good. I recommend usin 2700mAh Ni-MH. It seems to me that white-ballance is not performed when image is shown on the LCD, but when taken, image is balanced. Large LCD is surprisingly resilient to the sunlight situation. I guess die to Kodak's OLED technology.Wish they had 7 MegaPix, but Schneider lense offsets that.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good enough for my purpose..", "Author": "Kathy", "ReviewID": "R2DA3XNCFPM2YW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera.  I took it on a week long vacation, snapped over 200 pictures and several movie clips and never once charged the batteries.  I like the movie mode, it has a great sound - I find myself using it more and more.  I've even recorded at an indoor concert and the sound is incredible.  The only con of the movie mode is that you cannot zoom while it's recording.  A little annoying, but - I've learned to zoom in before I hit the record button.The display is big, however, one other con of this camera is that my pictures look a little fuzzy on the display. Once I download them in to the computer, they look very clear.  I'm just now ordering my first batch of prints so I am anxious to see how they print out.Overall - Kodak makes a great camera and I am very happy with this model.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Impressive little camera", "Author": "James L.

The battery has a long amount of life and it focuses in on what you want to take a picture of. The only thing he does not like about the camera is the fact that when you review the pictures after taking one it is pretty fuzzy. But when you review them regularly, after 5 seconds the picture turns into excellent quality. Also when you look at them on the computer it is great to and to get the pictures on the computer is a breeze. Overall my son is pretty happy with the camera he bought.", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great battery life, great features, very user friendly!", "Author": "S. Kahlden \"phanie624\"", "ReviewID": "R1CT7FNJBN8EAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1. Batteries: At first I thought my camera was defective because I put the batteries in that were provided in the pack and my camera kept shutting off..Then I charged the batteries and it was fine.. Oops!! I traveled to Italy and took over 250 photos over 4 days with the Ni-MH batteries recommended before having to change batteries!2. Great for point and shoot! When I take pictures, I dont want a heavy camera or one that has to be held with 2 hands to get steady photos..This camera takes great pictures just holding it one-handed. With the wrist strap, it's even easy to switch features on the top of the camera with the same hand you're holding the camera with!3. 2.5\" LCD Screen?! AMAAAAZING! Now I look at all the 1.7\"s and laugh :).. Screen is VERY bright and again easy for point and shoot. One setting even puts a little chart in the corner of the screen for you to monitor the light on the object you're taking a picture of. I've seen some reviews about how the screen is kind of blurry, however, you'll have a better idea if you zoom in. Another great feature on the screen is the \"Blur Alert\" which notifies you with a small green(=good), yellow or red(=blurry!) hand.4. So many setting options!Auto, Landscape, and Close-up shooting modes, plus 14 additional preset Scene modesAuto is great for all times.. Close-up took EXTREMELY FOCUSED pictures of my new engagement ring (blurred out the background, it was so in focus!!) Night portrait setting takes great pictures when it's evening time and you want a picture of you and also something behind you.. As long as the person holding the camera has a steady hand, this takes great pictures! Manner/museum setting is nice because it doesnt make any noises as you take the photo and again as long as you have a steady hand while taking photos in decent light (since the flash doesnt go off, you wont get bright pictures..obviously), pictures turn out great. Self portrait setting is really great for taking pictures of yourself--havent had a blurry self-portrait yet! Backlight setting is really good for when there is light behind a subject and you want the subject to be bright as well. Then you can even set the camera to take photos in black and white or sepia.5. 3x optical zoom is perfect.. I dont really use the digital zoom because it begins to distort the photoDownfalls:1. Takes a good 5 seconds from the time you turn on until you can take a photo--so it isnt good if you're an impulse picture taker :)2. Internal memory not enough..make sure you buy a memory card. I bought a 1 Gig and at 3.1 MP it takes over 900 pictures which is great because if I want to take at the 6 MP it offers, I still get about 500 photos!", "Date": "March 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "very good camera for the price", "Author": "laksh", "ReviewID": "R1K3XCAZG35QP7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "nice little camera slightly slow startup time but excellent shot to shot time,battery life is very good.The lens is of very good quality a good 6 mp cam though the 875 has superseeded it now.excellent picture qulaity use the manual settings in low light for great shots that is how yu get them.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Batteries and picture quality", "Author": "Kimberly A. Darwin", "ReviewID": "R2GXP1CNRITMVD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace an older Kodak Easy Share, which I loved.  It used an Ion battery, which seemingly never lost its charge.  The NiMH battery pack that came with this camera would NOT charge straight out of the package, and after many e-mails with Kodak, in which they refused to send another battery pack or 'own' the problem at all, I gave up.  I can take about 10 pictures with regular AA batteries, before they are used up.  That is ridiculous.  (Yes, I realize I can buy another package of NiMH batteries, but I shouldn't have to, since I already paid for them once!)  The picture quality is always a gamble.  Sometimes it's OK (never great), and other times, it is absolutely terrible.  Pictures taken with a tripod and self-timer, even in bright sunlight?  Awful.  Every time.  If it requires flash, it's worse than awful and not worth attempting.  Not very clear/crisp at other times.  Very inconsistent.  I like the ease of Kodak's software, but I am sorry to say I probably won't buy Kodak product after this experience.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Easy Share Kodak Camera-great little camera!", "Author": "Wise Woman \"Rebelline\"", "ReviewID": "R2W5KRUUQ60E82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera, although small, takes nice pictures!

Kodak was quite unsympathetic (when I contacted them upon returning home) and explained that lithium or NiMH re-chargeables were recommended.  I returned the other camera.
