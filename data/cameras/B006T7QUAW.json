I've been going through about 1 compact camera a year for 5 years now. The failure mode of those is always that the telescoping lens assembly stops working either because of grit in the gears or stripped gears. I bought this camera specifically because it is sealed.It's so sealed in fact that it's the perfect adventure camera. My favorite trick is to dunk it in a beer at a party and then snap a shot.Image quality is great in high light conditions, but due to small sensor size it's pretty grainy in low light.PROBLEM:The only problem with this camera is that while shooting video, one cannot zoom or the video goes out of focus until one has stopped changing the zoom setting. This makes it difficult to do shots of something coming toward or going away from the camera. While it's not a deal killer, it is disappointing. Here is a video I shot that should give you an idea of what I'm talking about.[...]", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix XP150", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R1V7J7H6SOUIJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A bit hesitant in purchasing this item after reading the reviews, seems that some people had problems with the camera not being water proof as advertised.  I did NOT experience this problem.  I found the camera to be all it was advertised and then some. Love this camera.  It did remain water proof and functioned admirably! Even found the battery life to be adequate and a bit more than expected.  Used the camera both in the pool and out in the ocean on snorkeling trips, dolphin dives, and even surfing! I have some fantastic and memorable pics that my family and I will certainly cherish.  This camera exceeded my expectations and was definitely worth the purchase price.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow", "Author": "Jessica", "ReviewID": "R2UR39T4S6P1W5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera was just like any other waterproof camera, up until I took it into the ocean. It says waterproof up to the 33 ft, I barely went into water that was 3 ft and it crapped out on me.

Poor quality & leaks!", "Author": "rs11gps", "ReviewID": "R2YS1IJ76EIEV1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a trip to Palau. No scuba, just snorkling. I worked for about 30 minutes, then fried itself !!I read the reviews before using it, and was careful checking the seals and locking the latches. About 30 minutes into snapshots, the lcd screen went blank and the camera stopped operating. I swam back to the boat, dried the camera off, and openned the door. I was greeted by a slight whiff of burned electronics, and a little trickle of water coming out of the case!  AAAaaarrrggghhh !!!!  There goes my photos for the trip.Just so you know, I am in my 50's and have used many Minolta, Nikon and Canon cameras for decades. My current SLR is a Canon 7D. I KNOW how to be careful with them.Instead of enjoying my island photo expedition, I watched the other tourists happily snapping away with ther GOOD cameras, while I sat there with an inert Fuji lump of worthless plastic.Now I am home, and TRY to find a Fujifilm consumer service line to call?  Yea, right...  IF I can track them down, I expect to hear: well, it IS an underwater camera... no guarantees. Sorry, we keep your money, you keep the lump of plastic.Recommendation: If you think about buying the XP-150, you might as well burn several $100 dollar bills instead... save the time and aggravation of expecting it to actually work.p.s. the only reason I gave it a \"1\" is that there is no zero rating.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "This Camera Will Leak!!!", "Author": "wrdcreater", "ReviewID": "R365TUSQNCWSPA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was awesome until it leaked, and now it is worthless!  Directions were followed carefully, no user error, and the product failed!  Also killed my 32 GB SD card!!  For less than 6 months of use, no damage to camera and it failed!  Do not trust this camera to be submerged!  My two cents.

I have to be careful not to shake too much underwater or the water may leak through.  And that's hard to do when you're trying to swim.  Ruined one set of pictures already since the water leaked in and we didn't take it deep at all.  The SD card worked again once it dried off.  But I wouldn't risk putting an expensive SD card on this camera.Even when the camera works, I can tell it's a bit moist inside where the battery/memory card goes after a day of use underwater use at the beach.  Just waiting for the next time it ruins another set of pictures or even the memory card.  It sucks because when it does, my entire set of vacation pictures will go too :(Camera still works but I don't recommend it.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fun camera!!", "Author": "Deanra", "ReviewID": "R18ZNID0GNSN1Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just returned from our cruise to Bermuda where we used this camera in the pool and the ocean!
