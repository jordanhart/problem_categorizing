I kept an eye on this starter kit which is perfect in terms of providing what's missing as in an extra battery, mini-hdmi and a bag. I ordered this and received the very next day thanks to amazon's great prime service.But to my disappointment when I opened the package I realized this bag is huge. It looks like to school bag and it can hold up to 2 DSLR's at the same time. So if you don't mind buying a huge bag to hold all your accessories go for it. Also the bag is sturdy and well-built.In the meanwhile I'll carry on my mission to find a medium sized bag to hold the t2i body, 2 lens, and couple of other accessories.ASTA LAVISTA BABY!!!!!", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "CANON STARTER KIT FOR EOS  Rebel T2i", "Author": "Claire", "ReviewID": "RD9Y4AZOEWYBO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just love this. I have looked over my town and couldn't find this anywhere. Even the camera stores didn't have it. The added bonus is that it is much CHEAPER!!! The battery and Mini-HDMI cable are great as well! You can move the inserts around if you don't have lens to keep everything in place and safe. The workmanship is very well done. The shipping was very fast and just like they stated.

As an example the top overlaps the sides with Velcro and the adjustable buckles well. The zippers are thick, and overall feels like quality.Inside the bag it has so many adjustable compartments you can organize the bag the way you need to. I expected quality when I went with Canon and again they delivered. I'm a student of photography learning from the best and you can't go wrong with this bag, it's worth it. Check prices out, they range from $100.00 to $160.00, the extra battery for the T2i alone cost's around $60.00 so at a $100.00 (about what I payed here, and delivery was quick) I'd say this is a lot of value as well.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my needs", "Author": "David Franklin Henson", "ReviewID": "R29QQFHKMZO810", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm just returning to semi-serious hobby photography after about a 20 year absence. My last camera used in this regard being a Cannon AE1. Anyway, the T2i is my new toy. With the small lense count (2) that I have right now, and the small accessory count, this bag is perfect.With the standardization attributes accross many accessories, etc... one would expect the pockets and things to fit 'just right', and they by all means do. All of the internal partitions can be relocated if necessary, though I've not found need to do so yet. Probably the coolest of the partition tricks are the two \"buffer\" L-shaped pieces that you can adjust vertically on one side of the camera to safely store the body with lense attached in padding. Very cool for quick draws, etc.All zippers seem sturdy, the female portion of the strap clasps are metal, while the male are plastic. The strapping goes completely around the bag, which is a nice touch. Also there is velcro connectivity inside the lid on the sides to further strengthen the bag's closed posture. Oh, and the tripod straps built accross the bottom of the case are a nice touch.Other than that, the spare battery works and is as handy as a spare battery should be. The HDMI cable functions and since that's 1's and 0's, that's about all you can ask for as well.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Jewele", "ReviewID": "RUNGFOKKXKFMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband just purchased a super expensive camera and bag was perfect for it.

I'm even more pleased with this starter kit than my previous one.The Canon 200DG carrying bag is the main item in the kit. It comes in a fairly large, sturdy illustrated box. The carrying bag comes out of the box entirely sealed in plastic. It's a two-tone, black-and-gray finished nylon bag, with the Canon logo emblazoned in shiny chrome on the front. The buckles that fasten the cover of the bag are made of shiny chrome, too. My old bag didn't have any chrome embellishments on it. I have to admit it looks quite nice! In effect, the bag is very appealing to look at. I like keeping my Canon investment in this bag. I like the fact that the bag is made by Canon specifically for the camera I own.The bag is extremely tough and well-made. It's put together with heavy duty stitching. It has generous padding from top to bottom and side to side. It has thick padded separators that can be configured in any number of ways. They stay where you want them to thanks to heavy-gauge velcro. The handles and the fastening straps are reinforced with black leather. There are rubber feet on the base of the bag so that the bag never has to rest directly on a wet surface when you're out in the field. There are two wide nylon straps at the base of the front of the bag for carrying a tripod. If you ask me, this bag is very well-engineered and thought out. There are zippered pockets on the sides and front of the bag, along with a mesh pocket inside the bag. There's plenty of convenient spaces for odds and ends. I keep my T3i body in the bag, along with my 18-135, 55-250, 18-55, and 50 f/1.8 II lenses. I also keep lens caps, extra batteries, the battery charger, extra SD cards, and a lens cleaning kit in the smaller, zippered pouches on the sides. Basically, this carrying bag holds my entire Canon T3i DSLR kit now - and in a very stylish manner.A very well padded, sturdy shoulder strap attaches to chrome-finished metal rings on either side of the bag. The shoulder strap is really nice. It's extra wide where it rests on the shoulder. The clasps that attach the shoulder strap to the bag are quite large and tough. And they swivel, too, so the strap doesn't get twisted and sways comfortably with you as you walk.This starter kit also comes with an OEM Canon LP-E8 battery. If you know how much authentic Canon batteries can cost, this extra item alone justifies the price of the starter kit itself. You'll also get a heavy duty Belkin HDMI-to-Mini HDMI cable to connect your camera to a HD TV. The cable is six feet long and comes sealed in very thick plastic. It appears to me that this cable can also be used with other Canon cameras that have mini-HDMI ports too, and since my other Canon cameras did not come with a HDMI-to-Mini-HDMI cable this one will come in handy. And six feet is a more convenient length than the shorter cable, less heavy duty cable that came with my T3i.I received my Canon T3i starter kit just three days after ordering it through Amazon. I think that's great. I don't know about you, but the less time I have to spend shopping from place to place, the better! Instead, UPS delivered my T3i starter kit right to my door. I really like that!I highly recommend the Canon T3i/T2i starter kit.

It is also very awkward to carry around and makes getting the camera out while out on the go feel like a hassle. The included backup battery is nice, but the mini-HDMI cable doesn't have a whole lot of purpose for a beginner. I'd recommend the Lowepro SlingShot 102 AW instead and simply buying a backup battery.Long Version: Let me get this out of the way; I like Canon, as a customer they have always treated me well, and maybe I am just lucky on that. Also, let me add, I am a beginner in the world of DSLR photography. Anyway, I purchased this bag about a year ago at the same time I purchased my Canon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD Standard Zoom Lens, my first DSLR camera. The bag will hold and protect your camera and kit lens, it also has room for 3 more lens or 2 more lens and and external flash, or whatever your set up is. The bag size, as far as holding equipment is good, with two side pockets, a forward pocket, and a hood pocket for additional equipment, giving you plenty of places to store that extra battery and the mini-HDMI cable.About that mini-HDMI cable, I've yet to use it. Granted, I am sure there is some amazing use for it, but whatever it is I haven't figure it out yet. So to me, as a beginner, it is just a cable that takes up space in the bag.As for the bag as a whole, like I said, it holds a lot, but the bag starts to feel heavy after about 30 minutes of carrying it even with a limited beginner setup. Additionally, it feels like such a hassle to get my camera out of the bag to take pictures. Both of these issues take away from the fun of photography and make me not want to take pictures when I am out with this bag.All in all, even though I like Canon, I can't recommend this bag to another beginner. Instead I'd recommend other beginners get the Lowepro SlingShot 102 AW.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$190.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Canon Starter Kit for EOS Rebel T2i SLR Camera 9320A018", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IKBuJL4QL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00393WXXC"}}
