{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great intro camera, but not for experienced or hardcore use", "Author": "Traveler", "ReviewID": "R515GI5L0JPOJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the N65 for a young nephew who's just getting involved in photography.  For the most part, this camera fits his needs.  It's highly automated and allows him to do high speed photography (sports), something many point and shoot 35mm cameras simply can't do.I've been using a Nikon N70, an older and somewhat more advanced camera, for about ten years.  I've always been pleased with it, for the most part.  One of the drawbacks, however, was its lack of a focus assist light.  The N65 delivers this.  The N65 also has a more advanced focus system, especially for moving objects.  Again, great for shooting sports.The N65 has all the standard modes - Full auto, aperature priority, shutter priority, portrait, sports, night, landscape, manual, etc.  As a hardcore user I find some these things unnecessary.  Still, I can see why other users would like these extra fuctions.Unlike the N70, the N65 in low light situations, in auto modes (auto, portrait, etc.), will release the flash without input from the user.  This is probably a great function for novice users.  As someone who can take a handheld shot at 1/15 or even 1/8 of a second, without using a flash, I found this feature annoying.  The user can circumvent this feature by using the manual modes (e.g. aperature priority).Another feature lacking on the N65 is a spot meter button.  This comes in handy in difficult lighting situations (e.g. half the image is in sunlight, the other in shade) when a center metering system will fail completely.I also found the N65, like most of the modern SLRS, as just a bit too flimsy.  (The heavier N70, when first released, was considered \"cheap\" by pro users.)  It's mostly plastic and it feels like it will break easily if dropped.  This is true with SLRs made by all the major manufacturers.  The 28-80mm lens also shares this cheap feel.The N65 is a bargain for novice users with prices on 35mm cameras falling steadily as digital begins to dominate the market.  Another good camera in this price range is the Canon K2.  Still, if you want control over your images or you need something tough and sturdy, it would be best to either pay more for a better camera or, at the other extreme, buy an older used Nikon from the days when they built cameras to last.", "Date": "June 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "The Pros and Cons for the Nikon N65", "Author": "Roy Chan", "ReviewID": "R3SECS3S04PLFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is a list of Pros and Cons for the Nikon N65.Pros: Feature Filled, Small, Light-Weight, Cheap, A Worthy Introduction to Nikon's 35mm SLR System, fairly inexpensive, good quality images, 2.5 fps., depth-of-field preview, 3D Matrix metering, Nikkor-lens compatible, portability, ease-of-use, durability, User friendly, 5 programmed modes, fully automatic capabilities, manual operation, fast autofocus, interchangable lenses, metal lens mount point, multiple eyepieces, Solidly constructed, tons of smart features, built-in flash, professional grade.Cons: No metering with MF lenses, may be not enough for professional photographers, slow flash sync, no backlit LCD, Cannot manually set ISO, The G lens that comes with it is garbage, Read-eye reduction feature, waiting for parts if broken takes forever, no vertical grip, Manual settings require two hands, Pop up Flash throws shadows in wide angle pictures if using lens hood, Battery Meter, Steep learning curve for trickier options; can be confusing to operate.", "Date": "May 7, 2003"}, {"Title": "Still Rockin the Film!", "Author": "B.

I'm just starting out in photography so it fits me very well.  It allows me to go all manual when I need to and has really given me consistent results.  It has a ton of features that I haven't even tapped into yet to improve picture quality in different situations.  I do alot of research before I purchase anything and this camera was highly recommended by proffesional photographers and amateurs alike as a perfect beginner to intermediate camera.  I have also seen alot of pictures taken with this camera and they are incredible.  Overall I love the camera and can't wait to take more pictures with it.", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Matthew Woodard", "ReviewID": "RWGKSJY4GNQLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, so it's not digital, but it has features that most digitals don't have. Just have an N65 along with a digital like me because it's still nice to get same day or one hour prints developed. I just love the Auto Exposure Bracketing and Mulitple Exposure capability. The auto focus helps alot. It's a good flash photography camera too. The Vari-Program on the N65 is lots of fun for an amature like you. In certain modes you can set a desired shutter speed and aperture.", "Date": "August 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "a good choice for students' in photography classs", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RC3NE1NU72TAR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're a student whose about to take a photography class this camera is the best choice for you.

Bought is because sick of those blury bad quality photos. This is good for all occasions, professional-everything. We bought another long zoom lens that makes it a proffesional camera. There is no question about it-buy it before you buy any other camera!  Very durable and proffesional quality. Good options for day and night shots. When will they make video camera's like this!  Of course you must press the button twice to focus and then the light will pop up then you shoot. At first your always worried your going to take a picture bought you'll get easily use to it. Look at pictures 20 years from now in good quality, you won't look back on the purchase. It's a Nikon at a great price that all families and photographers need. I'm not upsessed with photograghy, but I like to preserve memories and send good quality christmas cards out.  I got a digital Kyocera and we took 12 pictures before it broke. Of course that was several years ago when the camera was purchased a little under a thousand. We go the nikon because we knew it was easy and trustful. Their are sprint pcs palm sized digitals that are nearlu the same quality as our kyocera-Big Big Mistake!", "Date": "July 1, 2003"}, {"Title": "I was sold a broken Camera and refused a refund", "Author": "Regina Martin", "ReviewID": "R50KRBYPPKTFT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a set amount of money to spend on a camera for my Daughter's photography class.
