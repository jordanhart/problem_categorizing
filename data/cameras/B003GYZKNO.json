{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Price / Excellent Camera", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R10L8AEZJXV4T0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The one I bought is Green w370. Has one con, makes and records noise while video recording and adjusting the zoom at the same time. Other then that it takes great videos and fantastic pictures. The features are never ending, from croping pictures on the fly to making slide shows of pictures you took with music playing on the 3\" screen LCD on the back of the camera on the way home in the car!! Takes great night time pictures, it was pitch black out side, I saw a group of racoons on my roof and took out the camera and took several pictures whick \"all\" came out crystal clear. Has a program on the cd which comes with the camera called PMB which is great, you can make movies, show and insert dates, labels, face sort, play slide shows make them and then burn to dvd, cd all sorts of things. Back to the camera, it so easy to use it has several modes, easy to advanced expert all at the turn of a dial. everything shows up on great big 3\" lcd screen which is very high resolution and again crystal clear and you can change what shows up on the screen from complete set up detail to just the basics. It will show ISO battery level, picture file size 14meg to VGA which is small for emails, and many in between. also can do HD video and pictures for the hd tv, high quaility 14 meg a pic to hd video of 720HD which is like 30fps in high def. You can put in a 16gig memory card and take pictures all year long and not worry about space. With tht supplied cable you can hook it up to your regular or hd tv and play the videos you recorded right from the camera or the pictures in slide show with music or one at a time. Like I said it is robust with tfeatures too may to mention but thats a start and there many more. I paid 145.00 used like new condition and when I received it it was brand new in the box Yeepyy it was a deal of the century. I have two batteries and can pictures and videos all day and not worry and with 16gig memory thats not even a problem. I have been taking pictures since July itsOctober and its not full, there are like 1000 pics and hour of video and still no worries.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Upgraded my Pentax", "Author": "Jeanne", "ReviewID": "RIP7DW2AH3V63", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally updated my Pentax Optio & this is a fantastic choice.  Once I figured out how to turn off the automatic flash, I'm happy.  I haven't tried fireworks yet, but since it has a setting for them...it should be fine.  The close-up resolution is fantatic!  Speed...not so much, but I'm still learning.

Camera was in not perfect, but completely fine shape as stated in description. Small cosmetic imperfections but works great. Like 7x optical zoom, but wished it was backed up with digital zoom. Pictures look sharper on my 60\" tv, or computer than they do on camera's display. Pictures look pixelated on cameras' display. Uses SD (or micro SD, like my cellphone-with SD adapter) or Sonys Pro Duo memory stick. Gotta have that memory card, or you only get 3 pics on internal memory! Delay on taking shots is annoying, but just have to take into account. Like the camera, small, sharp shots (when viewed off of camera) and ability to use PRO Duo memory card directly into my Sony TV - no cords. Was a great price on good camera, and I'm a happy camper.", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera with nice features for the money.", "Author": "sdcarol", "ReviewID": "RB4FMVWB988QG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched many different brands and models of cameras before purchasing this Sony Cyber Shot and and very happy with my purchase.  Great camera with great features for the price.  Real nice quality photos , and I am certainly an amatuer photographer !", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "ZacharySzczer", "ReviewID": "RNE0MM8RQ43W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a camera genius, but I needed to replace my 10 year old digital with a simple, easy, low maintenance point and shoot.  I recently moved and needed something to take along while hiking.  The camera is thin and small enough to fit in my pocket while roaming the woods.  The pictures I have taken so far have come out wonderful and the speed from turning on to ready is great.  This camera fit my budget and was exactly what I was looking for.  I still have a lot to learn about the other functions, but the ones I have used have been great", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "In a bad condition", "Author": "J.
