{"Reviews": [{"Title": "If this camera is on your short list, it's the right choice", "Author": "Glenn Hoback", "ReviewID": "RNJT035O0Y5J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're reading this review, you're probably like me, a novice user buying his first digicam. And like me, after having read and re-read reviews of several dozen cameras, this camera keeps showing up your short list.  Still, there's so many options out there you keep obsessing about making the right choice. I finally decided to take the plunge and order this camera, and I'm amazed how correct my choice was. Here were my main areas of concern while I was trying to decide on whether to buy this camera (they'll probably sound familiar) and how my actual experience stacked up against my concerns:1. \"Low\" resolution of 2 Megapixels: Unless you plan to blow your shots up to poster-size, 2MP is ideal. Don't get caught up in the \"my MP is bigger than yours\" race, as another reviewer said 2MP is the sweet spot for photos. Just leave the camera at its max settings and it's perfect, the file size is reasonable yet you'll still get every amazing detail. For example, I took a shot of my cat and you can see every hair and every whisker, even a little bit of \"sleepy stuff\" in the corner of her eye since she had just woken up from her nap.  And this was just the third shot I took after removing it from the box. Yes, it's that good.2. \"Not enough zoom\":  I'll admit, this was a huge issue for me. I was bound and determined that i wanted a camera with a higher zoom capability, like one of the Olympus 10x models. But actually having gotten a chance to use it, i've found the zoom capability, while nice, isn't the holy grail I thought it would be. Certainly not enough to spend a couple hundred dollars more to get.3. Size - The photos make the camera look tiny. I thought it might be better to get a bigger camera with big Tonka-toy buttons and that it would be easier to handle. Don't worry, the camera feels great in my hands, and i'm over six feet with big stubby fingers. I'm sure it will fit your hands just fine as well.4. Other competing models in the Canon line:  This was another problem area. The A-series and G-series cameras all seem so good, that i wanted badly to get one of the more fully-featured (and expensive) models like the A80 or G5 to make sure i wasn't missing out on anything. And looking back now, most of the features I thought would make a huge difference don't seem to matter now. What seems important to you now when you're trying to make a buying decision probably won't be when you're actually out there using the camera. Out in the field, you'll want something which is relatively straight-forward and not tediously complex, but flexible enough to change a setting if absolutely necessary.  This camera offers exactly that.  Trust me, when you're out in a picture taking environment, you're not going to be telling yourself (or wanting to tell your photo subjects), \"hold on for a couple minutes while I put on the wide-angle lens.\"5. Controls and the learning curve:For a novice, the controls look a bit intimidating.  And they can be, if you don't read the manual at all or spend any time going through the settings.  But thankfully, the camera controls are well set-up, intuitive, and easy to learn.  Yes, you can start shooting straight out of the box, but if you spend as little as 15-30 minutes reading how to operate the controls before you begin, it'll be well-worth your time.  That won't be enough to learn everything the camera can do, but is enough to get you started on the right foot, and will put you weeks or months ahead of the game.  I spent about 20 minutes learning about my camera after I got it, and my first pictures already looked better than the ones my father takes with his Canon G5 that he's owned nearly a year but never bothered to read the manual for.  THE BAD:Shutter lag is perhaps my biggest gripe.  Depressing the shutter fire button half-way focuses the camera, then depressing it the rest of the way fires the shutter.  There's a brief but noticeable lag between depressing the button and the photo being taken, perhaps a half-second or so.  Not a huge issue, but sometimes annoying, and can definitely get frustrating if you're trying to get just the right shot of a non-cooperative subject.  Like with my cat, I'd wait for the exact moment when she was looking at me, I'd press the button, and the lag meant that she was no longer looking at the camera when the photo actually gets captured.  I'm sure it would be more of the same if you were trying to take photos of an infant or child.  Not a deal-breaker, but it can make for some frustration.  Inserting batteries in the dark can be a pain, unless you have memorized the pattern for which batteries go in which direction.  Again, not a huge issue, but can be frustrating.CONCLUSION:If you're trying to decide between the A60 and either another manufacturer's offering or another Canon A-series,  get this camera.  This is a better camera than the competing Nikon, etc. and if you're thinking you'll need the additional features or MP of a more expensive model, you likely won't. If you did, you'd know that already and wouldn't be looking at this camera. So save your money and get this instead, it will MORE than meet and surpass your needs.  You'll be very happy you did.  I already have my Dad thinking she should switch cameras with me, and considering his costs about triple what mine did, that tells you that this little gem is a winner.", "Date": "February 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Yes!, it's what I want.", "Author": "S.

After taking several pictures, here are what I came up with....Goods:- Fast start up time: less than 3 seconds. You are not gonna miss a quick shot. 3x optical zoom is also fast and quiet. The other nice thing is...it doesn't have a separated lense cap. This is what I hate about my Olympus C3040.- Good picture quality: A60 produces properly exposed pictures and saturated colors in several different light conditions.- Aperture and Shutter priority modes: you probably need this feature to take advanced shots.- Great macro capability: you can take a picture of flowers as close as 2-3 inches. Focus is also fast. Compared to my minolta f100 and olympus c3040, I love A60's macro better.- Improved night/indoor mode: this is what I don't see in canon s200 and the only reason I returned that little S200.- Movie w/sound record: this camera records and playbacks movie with sound in AVI format at 15 frames/second. It runs pretty smooth.- Lens adaptor: This camera can accept external wide-angle, tele, and filters.- Use standard AA batteries: I think A-series is the only canon line that support AA batteries. If you don't wanna spend [money]for a second propietary battery, get A-series. Four fully charged batteries seem to last very long. I took about 100 pictures with LCD turn on, it's still full.- Fast and easy USB connectivity: Compared to Olympus c3040 and Minolta F100, it takes very short for my windows xp to recognize this A60. In addition, you DON'T NEED a software at all.- Feels: this camera is not too big or too small. It just comfortably fits in my hand. The body looks like metal and the handle is plastic. It's a good combination since you don't wanna touch a cold metal camera in winter.- Low priceBads:- Ocassionally, purple fringe is visible in very high constrat shots.- Poor auto white balance under tungsten light.- No 1280 x 960 resolution. It has 1600 x 1200, 1024 x 768, and 640 x 480.- Small LCD: could be 1.8\" instead of 1.5\".- Rubber USB/AV port cap: with frequent uses, it can be broken soon.", "Date": "May 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "All around great camera for price and features.", "Author": "Steve B", "ReviewID": "RXP301T19Y0RQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok I've been looking for a digital camera for about a year now, I'm cheap so I waited until I found a product that had what I want for the price I wanna pay. .... the 2 mega pixels is just fine for ANYONE taking pictures and printing them.. 2MP Cameras print out great 8x10 photos so if you dont need to print anything bigger than that save your money and stay with a 2 mega pixel.

The camera at its highest resolution (1600x1200) takes gorgeous photos, with rich warm colors.  No pixilation and very little purple fringing appear on the images.  The camera itself includes some very advanced features for its price, all of which can be adjusted in manual mode.  However, most users will never touch these options, instead opting for the simple Auto mode, which automatically chooses the perfect settings.  The only downside to the camera itself is that instead of using metal, the casing is plastic, and therefore feels somewhat cheap.  Nonetheless, the build quality is generally good and the buttons and ports are conveniently located.  The camera is small, but is by no means one the smallest and lightest digital cameras on the market.Along with the camera, the box includes an industry standard puny 16MB Compact Flash card, that should be immediately replaced, and four alkaline batteries.  The battery life is very good; the camera can operate for several days of heavy use without replacement.  Nonetheless, I recommend Ni-MH Rechargeable batteries, which provide an even longer life.  The included `Zoom Browser EX' software very easy to use and incorporates some fairly powerful features. If you don't want to spend much money and want an easy to use digital camera with great image quality, look no further than the Canon PowerShot A60.  However, if you want a camera that can take larger photos and has more powerful features try the Canon S45, S50, or the Canon G3.

One of my friends accompanying me on this trip bought one shortly afterwards and another bought one upon our return to the US because they were so impressed.  Great camera for the money and for what I use it for.  It is nice and compact but not overly so.  The controls are easy to use and understand with very little familiarization needed.  This camera has many more options than most consumers will ever use, but for those of you who want to be creative, this definitely allows for it.  I particularly like the ability to \"stitch\" a panoramic scene together.  The packaged software does a great job of this and is extremely user friendly.This came with a 16MB CF card which is kind of useless I think.  I bought a 256MB CF card at the same time I bought the camera and have been using it.  We took a short vacation and I was able to take several video clips and almost two hundred photos without downloading.  Most of these were at the highest resolution so I would recommend a higher capacity CF card.  I also use the rechargeable NMh batteries instead of alkalines.  I get more time out of these and are shorter in the long term than replacing alkalines all of the time.  So far I am very, very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.

In all-automatic mode, this A60 is great!!! The Canon lens is superb.  Pictures I took of my Siberian husky on the lawn showed in excellent detail my dog's blue eyes, whiskers and fur, plus the green strands of grass of the lawn.  The metering-, flash and other electronic systems are superb.  Indoors inside the house, and indoors at a restaurant... the camera performed very well with perfectly (flash-)illuminated and focused pictures. It was also easy to review pictures taken and deleting those I didn't care for.  Using the USB to copy files onto the hard drive was straightforward.  I bought 8 NIMH-rechargeable batteries plus charger as well as an AC-adapter. ( I shouldn't have bought the AC-adapter;  the rechargeable long-life NIMH batteries are sufficient.) I also bought a Simpletech 128MB CF card since the CF card that came with the camera was good only for a handful of shots. The 128MB-CF card will go a long way since I've started taking 1-megapixel pictures.  [ 1MP pictures are easier to send via email]  I've also used the picture \"editor\" software for cropping and to reduce red-eye; learning how to do these things was easy.I am extremely pleased and I highly recommend the Canon A60. Picture-quality is superb;  the menu system is straightforward and user-friendly. The more-commonly used options are easy to remember and use and result in high-quality pictures.

Scosyrev", "ReviewID": "R2JN4QKD8FQR8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since there are already plenty of positive reviews, I will focus on the few lacks of this camera.- Impossible to record the \"date picture taken\" on the image.(Trying to pass for professional camera? :) Many simplier models have this useful feature).- Zoom lever is not most conveniently located. It would be easier if it was on the back of the camera.- Navigation buttons look strange being round instead of arrow shaped. This is changed in Power Shot A80.- Power on/off button is easy to be accidentally activated. Sliding type would greatly decrease the chances.-Every time the camera is turned on, a lot of energy is used to mechanically extend the telescopic lenses. If they were fixed with attachable cap, battery performance could be improved; size, however, would definitely suffer. Reliability of lenses moving motors is naturally limited, which possibly could be the the cause for the famous Error 18.-Ergonomics.  \"Set\" button, could be better positioned somewhere near the side navigation buttons - on the right, as set up on most cameras.-Camera also doesn't come with sufficient memory card and reliable battery/charger, requiring spending additional money on accessories. This is, however, what keeps the price at its level.-Side rubber cover can break if used repeatedly over a long period of time. Design could be more reliable if the cover would open freely.-Very important issue - batteries have to be removed every time they need to be charged, which places great strain on the plastic battery cover that would eventually break with extensive use. Cameras that enable batteries to be charged without removing them, greatly exceed the durability in the long period of use.-Plastic tripod thread, less durable compared to metal ones.Despite all the listed cons, this is a very modern camera with superior image quality and outstanding set of features and controls.

To that, I added a few requirements of my own:- Should look good, (Hey. I'm a sucker for appearance when it comes to technology)- Some settings I can play around with, (I want to be able to influence diaphragma settings, flash usage, shutter times, etc)- It should have the feel of a regular camera (I want to FEEL I'm using a camera, rather than some light-weight plastic box)- It should be afordable.After all of these, and reading some reviews and recommendations from friends, I decided I wanted a Canon. While looking at a number of cameras, I finally decided on the A60.I figured 2 million pixels would be enough, considering I don't intend on enhancing the pictures at all. Just regular size pictures would do perfectly fine for me. The camera also allows me to control the technical settings like the diaphragm, shutter time, etc. And it actually fellt like a real camera.

It will take good pictures day or night, inside or out. The only disappointing feature is the limited optical zoom.

The camera also will not take an out of focus image... it either requires you to zoom out or to move a few steps.  This can be a pain but it keeps you from getting blurry images.  Even action shots come out sharp.The LCD screen is too small and in bright light (I was on a beach) it's totally useless.  Plus it deceptively makes your image seem farther away than it really is...a nice surprise when you get your prints back and they're MUCH closer. The only problem that -really- bothered me (which is why I give it 4 of 5 stars) was that there is a delay (enough for someone to walk in your frame or your subject to move) between when you press the shutter and when the camera actually captures the image.  Not a problem if you're taking photos of still things but can be a really issue when you're taking active shots.  One recommendation is to buy a larger compact flash than what's included with the camera, especially if you're like me and use the highest resolution.  I bought two 128MB Viking cards (1 was a back up) and have had no problems and LOTS of storage space (I think 1 card would give around 200 images).

I've only had this camera for a few hours, but there's so much room to go pro with it.  Manual focus, ISO, aperture are just a few of the things you can play with to take some really amazing pictures.  Even the point and shoot pictures are amazing.  The color is extremely vivid.One feature that I am very fond of is the Auto Focus system.  The camera automatically tries to figure out what you are focusing on, and enclosed that area with a box.  If the box doesn't appear where you want it to, then you know that you need to move or change the zoom if you want your pictures to come out clear and crisp.  It is a very intelligent feature.I give this camera 5 stars because, as this being my first digicam and I am only a beginner, it has a lot to offer.  And the price.

I did a lot of research and found this to have the best combination of features and control.This I bought in order to supplement my 35mm for quick travel photos and online auction product photos as well as giving my wife something she doesn't have to think about using.This is a tiny camera that you can take anywhere and get pictures instantly.It feels substantial in hand. It's stout and seems solid unlike cheap point and shoots.All the controls seem well positioned.It's simple to use just as a point and shoot, you can even overide its automatic exposure controls. It can display settings to overide like aperrature and shutter speed etc.It doesn't require film that has to be developed so it saves money (providing you have a computer). My wife wastes more pictures with film cameras so I REALLY save money. If you take pictures you don't like you simple delete them from memory.Speaking of memory you can get film cards that hold 100s of images. My 128mb card holds around 170ish. The card supplied with the camera holds around 40 or 50.I prefer composing my shots on the LCD screen. They say the batteries will wear out faster if you use that but I don't care, it's easier to see what I'm composing.Transfering images from camera to computer is very easy. The Included software makes it virtually automatic.One of the big issues that I wrestled with was how much digital resolution would be enough and what is too little.I also thought that cameras at this size where just glorified point-and-shoots. To some extent it's true but there's more use potential with these little digitals.I'm not a big fan of the telephoto lenses on these little cameras. They're ment to give versatility but there's a tradeoff in image quality. How much? Maybe it's negligible but  I'd rather have a better quality lense that doesn't move than one that's more of a gimick.  Telephoto images from low quality lenses magnify the limits of the camera.I actually like the focal lengths of this camera. Suits me better for general photography. I usually keep it set on one focal length anyways which is just 105mm.Too my surprize 2 megapixels is fine! It's actually recommended but it does depend on what exactly you're looking for in term of print output size, if you're going to print. If not then you don't even need 2 megapixels just get 1 megapixel. If you limit yourself to online email, ebay and 5x7 prints it's perfect. You could go as much as 8x10 with some quality eduction. I'm told at that size, 8x10 that 3 megapixels would be better. I haven't and don't intend too so in my case it's overkill.Digital photo quality printers are giving people the need to print 8x10s. So again, if you want to go that size and really want a better image you could go to the A70@ 3 megapixels or the A80 is a 4 megapixels and frankly I'm not sure why. At that size not only are you limited by pixels but by the quality of the lens. I shoot all of my photos that may or may not be enlarged with a Nikon F3 35mm. I prefer taking pictures the old fashion way. Using different film, good lenses and controlling exposures manually. If I really wanted to take really great digital images then something at the higher end is in order with finer lenses but this little A 60 is in a different category with its own strengths.2 things that stand out that I don't like but have adapted too are the shutter lag and the USB cover. The time between when you push the shutter button and when the camera fires. So don't expect to catch exactly what you see in an instant thanks to the shutter lag.The rubber cover for the USB connection cord doesn't seem like something that's designed for a lot of use without having to be replaced down the road. It just doesn't seem like something that will survive rrepeated opening and closing. But so far so good after a year of use here.Overall I'm greatly surprized at the quality of this camera.

I did a lot of background research before settling on this model.  This camera received rave reviews from pros and casual users alike.  I needed a camera that would be very simple to use, yet had enough features that one can grow into them once they became more familiar with digital photography.  Also the price on this camera was very reasonable (around $150 dollars) so you couldn't really go wrong.  In addition, this camera uses compactflash memory card (the most widely used with the highest storage capacity of all the cards out there) and uses common AA batteries rather than a proprietary one, which could be a headache to replace.My dad is relatively averse to new technology, so I knew I needed to get a camera that does not need loads of adjustments to use.  When I took this camera out of its box, I was surprised at how nice it felt in my hand. It has overall sturdy construction with pleasing silver finish.  Also the zoom is easy to use and layout of the controls is very intuitive.  Let me say it took me only about 15-20 minutes to give my dad a crash lesson on how to use this equipment and that's saying a lot.  I did not teach him the advanced controls of course, but he was happy with the user-friendly controls.  I did not have to read the entire manual (quite thick by the way) to learn the general controls, which is a big plus.Now the reason for the 4 stars.  First of all, if you are new to digital photography, make sure you buy a set of rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries (over 2000mA would be preferable; higher rating means it will last longer, the range is from around 1500mA to 2400mA for AA batteries).  This camera comes with regular AAs which won't last more than 50 shots.  Also the battery door was flimsy and somewhat tricky to operate.  The accessories panel on the left side of the camera is rubber and also looks flimsy.  Lastly, I had to purchase the camera case from Canon separately, and I strongly believe you need this to protect the camera.  So two flimsy doors and missing case gives this camera 4 stars, but those are minor details to many.If you are looking for good entry-level camera out there don't hesitate and settle on the Canon A60.  It has crisp pics, great controls, and bargain price.

Is 4 enough? 5? 12? Certainly if you're trying to produce exhibition-quality 8x10s and 11x14s you need as many pixels as you can stuff into a camera. But 90% of what I photograph never makes it to print; most of it goes on the web. And for the 72 dpi images that your web browser likes to display, 2MP is more than enough.There are a lot of 2MP cameras out there, as it's a perfect size for web, email and the 4x6 prints that are a standard for familay snapshots. It's a very competitive area pricewise, too. The A60 caught my for a number of reasons, not the least of which was my previous good expreience with my Canon G2:1. It takes AA batteries. Dedicated rechargeables are expensive, and there's no assurance you'll be able to get replacements a few years down the line. But rechargeable AAs are common and inexpensive.2. Manual controls. The A60 has nearly the same range of manual controls as my G2 or the newer G5. About the only thing it doesn't have is provision for off-camera flash. 3. Video. It'll take video clips in a choice of resolutions4. Availability of underwater housing. You can get an underwater housing for almost all the Canons (the exception being, oddly enough, the semi-pro G series). I'm not a diver, but I do like to take cameras out kayaking and hiking in all sorts of weather. Until now I've used a Nikonos or *very* carefull taken my digital camera out of its protective case to take a few quick shots.5. Image quality. Canon has consistently been one of the top names for digital image quality, along with Nikon, Fuji and (to a lesser extent) Minolta.6. Ergonomics: It fits the hand nicely, with all the controls right where you need them. The viewfinder is sharp and clear. 6. Price.

Pomeroy", "ReviewID": "R24M2X55ALSKYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Taken on its own merits this is a fine little camera, particularly useful for its fully manual mode, although the only reason you might buy it over the Powershot A70 and A85 models is because, like me, you're poor, either because you don't earn very much money or because you spend all the money you earn without thought of the consequences. The A70 and A85 are identical in terms of features and offer higher resolutions. The A60 is, however, a very good camera. In no particular order...The image quality is sharp and clear, indeed too sharp at times, and a 2MP image fills up a 21\" monitor. To a great extent the 'megapixel race' is a matter of pride and face; the only people who would benefit from a higher resolution are the awful, awful people who post on Photo.net, who will buy a top-notch Nikon digital SLR instead, because (a) it's their livelihood and (b) it impresses clients and models. It's a different world.For the rest of us, the only major bursa in the A60s photographic trochanter is the digital sharpening filter which the camera applies to the image, and if you take a photograph of - for example - a sharp-edged cathedral against a blue sky, the cathedral ends up with an oddly sharp 'aura' around it. Thankfully you can turn this off by selecting 'low sharpening' as a special effect.The close-up macro mode autofocuses very well - you can't really use the screen to focus, unless you use 'zone focus' with the manual mode - and although I never expected to use macro, I find myself frequently photographing lots of bugs, fingers, nails, stones, flecks of spittle etc up close. Probably not a selling point for most people, but it's fun.In 35mm film terms, the zoom lens goes from roughly 35mm to roughly 50mm, i.e. from wide-angle to neutral. It's not particularly useful, and I keep it at its widest setting. The aperture at 35mm is f2.8, which is average for a film camera, and at 50mm is f4.8, which is not great, although the CCD seems more sensitive than film (you can set the ISO speed from 50-400, although I leave it on 50, and it's definitely more sensitive than ISO 50 film). The maximum shutter speed is 15 seconds. Up to about 10 seconds the visible parts of the images are noise-free, although if you subsequently brighten them with Photoshop they don't look very good at all.The Powershots use ordinary AA batteries and widely-available compact flash cards, rather than odd lithium cells and obscure 'memory sticks'. If you take about twenty shots a day and spend a few minutes on each one, looking through the screen and juggling your tripod, four 2350 rechargable batteries last for about a week.As for filters and accessory lenses, bah. There are wide-angle and telephoto add-on lenses, which require an adaptor, which has to be bought seperately. You will not purchase these, not ever, and they might as well not exist. Sadly Canon do not offer an M42 screw-mount adaptor.As for lag time, I can sense confusion in the other reviews. When you lightly press the shutter, the camera focuses and sets the exposure; when you press the shutter slightly more, it takes the picture after a delay of a fraction of a second. If it was a long exposure it then takes some time chuntering away, processing the image. If you therefore keep your finger on the shutter button, there is very little delay.", "Date": "December 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Gabby McCone", "ReviewID": "R31D7A12VL7UJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has to be the COOLEST CAMERA EVER!

I have family and friends who've spent twice the amount on a fancier camera, but they use it less because it's so confusing.LAG-TIMEThis is one of the A60's biggest drawbacks. The lagtime on my camera can be as long as two seconds, which makes it hard to capture \"the moment.\" Within that time, the subject can close his/her eyes, move out of the frame, etc.VIDEO FEATUREShoots decent video, but of course, video's a memory hog, so be sure to have a bigger card (256MB minimum) or you'll be out of space quickly.

The best thing about this camera is that if you know absolutely ZERO about taking pictures just switch to \"auto\" mode and snap away.  If you want to take pictures at night and want full control of the cameras aperture and shutter speed switch to \"M\" and it's all you.  I compared this cam against the Nikon 2100 and Sony DPS-72.  The Nikon didn't have an AF illuminator which makes it hard to focus under dark conditions and had a horrible menu system.  The Canon has a 5 point auto focus sytem which basically makes the camera bulletproof against taking a bad picture.  The Sony, like all Sony products, overemphasizes reds and doesn't fit in your hand like the A60 does.  With the Canon all you need is one hand to hold the camera.  Another great thing about this camera is the battery consumption.  With the LCD off this thing can take pictures all day long!! Literally!!

I have the Powershot A60 and have worked a bit with the A70.  The only difference on these cameras is that the A70 has more megapixels, other than that they are THE SAME.  The cameras offer various features, each with several different ways to manipulate the camera, including shutter speed and aperture.  For the beginner, it offers a few preset options that allow a quick switch to the desired need of the user.  The manual is very clear and easy to apply.  I would recommend this camera to someone wanting a point and click camera, as well as a more advanced person desiring some control of the camera.This camera has optional shutter speeds of up to 15 seconds, which I like to use with streams and other pictures involving water.  The speed has its highest shutter speed at 1/2000 of a second, which I haven't yet had success with, but will have fun playing with (it needs to be really bright for this).  I haven't yet played with the aperture, but it seems like it will be fun to play with as well.If you are wondering if you need 3 MP (A70), consider what you want to do with the pictures.  I would recommend a 3 MP if you want to do some cropping or want to blow up pictures greater than 5x7.  I simply use my A60 just for 4x6 and looking at pictures on my computer, which it does an excellent job of.I would recommend getting either a 128 or a 256 Mb compactflash card (cards used in these cameras) in addition to this camera (runs between $40 and $70), because the camera only comes with a 16 Mb card, which holds about 15-20 pictures.  I personally prefer Lexar's 12x or higher cards.  Get rechargable batteries!!!  Amazon's prices seems to be the cheapest for both cameras and compactflash cards (or within a couple bucks of other places).I would highly recommend either the Powershot A60 or A70 to anyone that wants a digital camera because of the versatility offered.-------------------------------Update:I have now had my Powershot A60 for over two years, and it is still functioning despite the serious abuse I have dealt to it. The camera has been dropped numerous times and has also taken a tumble down a 20 foot rocky steep hill (I thought it was a goner after that one). It has endured backpacking, rock climbing, and general outdoor adventures with me, and although its casing shows many scraps, dents, and scratches, the camera's functionality is beyond all of my expectations. The only problems that have developed is that the LCD seems to be dying slowly and about 20% of in-door poorly lit shots turn out grainy and have horizontal lines (all of which occurred after that major tumble, so I expect that is the cause); that is, 80% of in-door shots still look great. At the prices you can find this camera at around the internet, it is an awesome intro and general use digital camera, and with the low price, you can even pick one up for your kid (since it is now so cheap -- look elsewhere than Amazon). Anyways, I am looking to pick up a second one of these for the inevitable event that I completely destroy this sturdy camera.Also, in its 2 years of use, I can honestly say that I have not found a single time where I truly needed more than my 2 MP to get a great shot. I have taken this camera to the Canadian Rockies, to the Western Caribean, and all over the western US, and of all of the pictures I have, I don't see a true need for a higher megapixel than 3 MP (mine is 2 MP) or zoom (3x), unless you need a camera for your profession.---------------------------Second update (July 17th, 2006)Still going strong. It's been dropped again onto asphalt and still works. There are occasional pictures that have lines across them, but I think this is due to the number of times its been dropped (and most pictures are still perfectly clear).----------------------------Last Update (Dec 14th, 2006)Well, I dropped it one too many times.

Also, expectation was that I would print 4 x 6 or a max of 8 x10 inch sizes. For this 2 mp should be just about fine. I saved nearly 100 dollars over the price of a 4 mp A80.I have now had the A60 for 9 months and have no regrets. Have mainly been emailing photos to family and friends. I did print a few 5 x 7 pictures, and the quality has been great.Initially did try various shooting modes, but, now the only modes I really use are the Auto, the Night Shot and the Fast Action ones.I particularly like the 'stitch' utility which was a part of the CD. Have been able to piece together some wonderful landscapes, and one semi-circular rainbow.Initially used standard AA batteries, but, found that too be expensive. Often needed one set of batteries for 40 to 50 photographs. Now switched to NiMh rechargeables and they have been giving good performance.Another advantage is that one can attach standard telephoto and wide lenses. Did attach a wide angle lens. It worked great outdoors. However, the photos taken indoors with the flash on had a problem as the lens obstructed the flash. With a telephoto lens attached there is no problem.The camera has been quite sturdy as well. It has usually been flung in the back-pack and taken one small fall without any problems.Then only thing I am not too happy about is the lag. It is just too difficult to get a moving object in the frame because of the delay.Overall, I am quite happy with the purchase.

Many simplier cameras have this useful feature)- Zoom lever is not in the most conveniently located. It would be eaier if it was on the back of the camera.- Navigation buttons look strange being round instead of arrow shaped. This is changed in Power Shot A80.- Power on/off button is easy to be accidentally activated. Sliding type would greatly decrease the chances.-Every time the camera is turned on, a lot of energy is used to mechanically extend the telescopic lenses. If they were fixed with attachable cap, battery performance could be improved; size, however, would definitely suffer. Reliability of lenses moving motors is naturally limited, which possibly could be the the cause for the famous Error 18.-Ergonomics.  \"Set\" button, could be better positioned somewhere near the side navigation buttons on the right, as used in most cameras.-Does not come with sufficient Memory card and reliable battery/charger, requiring spending additional money on accessories. This is, however, what keeps the price at its level.-Side rubber cover can break if used repeatedly over a long period of time. Design could be more reliable if the cover would open freely.-Very important issue - batteries have to be removed every time they need to be charged, which places great strain on the plastic battery cover that would eventually break with extensive use. Cameras that enable batteries to be charged without removing them, greatly exceed the durability in the long period of use.-Plastic tripod thread, less durable compared to metal ones.Despite all the listed cons, this is a very modern camera with superior image quality and outstanding set of features and controls.

At that time, one person talked about some \"E18\" error but said that his camera still functioned with the error.  The rest of the reviews seemed excellent, so I bought the camera (I can't remember if I got it for $150 or $250).  My camera has been taking excellent pictures these past two years and I can't ask for more from a point-and-shoot for amateurs.  I just went on a an eight-day vacation earlier this month and, on the seventh day, I noticed that the LCD viewfinder turned purple when I titled my camera 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  Over the next two days, I took vertical pictures by rotating my camera clockwise and all was fine.However, when I returned home, I decided to read up about the problem.  The A60's reviews were full of people talking about \"that dreaded E18 error\".  One review for the A70 said that someone else received the purple LCD screen by tilting his camera, but he said that his pictures turned out either all-purple or had purple bands of color.  My pictures look great, but I don't want to, while on vacation, discover that either my pictures are all purple or my camera won't work because of E18.Consequently, I am looking for a new camera.  First, though, I'm going to do a little more research and wait for the prices to go down.  Hopefully, I'll purchase a new camera before my A60 stops working entirely.The bottom line: I've heard this error applies to almost ALL of Canon's cameras.  DO NOT BUY FROM CANON!  Go with Nikon or Olympus.Since I can't change the stars I gave this camera, my new rating is ONE (1) OUT OF FIVE (5) STARS.

And yes, this review is definately for casual photographers and starters.-2 megapixels? Not a problem. I've already snapped quite a few pictures, and I'm pretty pleased with the quality. As stated, our family's other digital is 3megs, and there's not much difference. I'm keeping it in highest resolution (1600x1200 Superfine), and at this resolution a 64 meg card will hold 61 pictures- which is more than I'm going to need at one time. Not to mention the camera itself comes with a spare 16meg card if you haven't gotten one for it. On our refridgerator we have word magnets (not much larger print than the text you're reading). I took a picture from across my kitchen and was able to read them off the image (note that this was in max quality). Unless you want to blow up portions of images or print off wall-size posters... this camera seems to have enough quality for most applications. If you're comparing cameras and the difference between numbers can save you some money, go with this one.-Software: With a few exceptions, it can be said that digital imaging devices tend to come with horrible software. For someone like me who has a little knowledge of photo editing, most all image programs perform the one necessary task- getting images off the camera and onto the computer. I personally probably won't even try the onboard software since I already have a means to edit and share my photos. If you really haven't ever edited photos before, then using the prepackaged software might be your only choice. And if you're a very casual user, the onboard software is probably going to do everything you need it to do. But if you have any software at all that you enjoy using for editing photos, it probably has an Import feature to get your pictures for you. Stick to that.-Overall saisfaction: All I was looking for was a replacement for the countless instant cameras I've gone through with my fiancee. What I got was a smart little camera that's more than worth what you pay. The assortment of features also makes it obvious that there's plenty of room to grow if you ever want to learn the finer arts of adjusting your pictures.

The error 18 comes up (I researched this) from the zoom lens not fuctioning because it is physically broken (being dropped onto a hard surface) this camera as well as any electronic product must be handled with care (hand strap). As far as grainy or dark pics, get to know the camera, the flash range is only 8 feet like most other built in flashes. Learn to use the other features to compensate for non optimal shooting situations, practice, practice, practice. Oh, and a can of compressed air works well to remove dust from the lcd screen and the lens, use periodically as you would on any camera for best results and satisfaction.", "Date": "September 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - Great Value", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3FAG21XAG6NX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a Canon Elph 2 years ago and have been pretty pleased with it.

The portrait feature works great and the shutter speed feature worked well too.  My friend went to the local electronic store where they tried to get him to buy a camera with a lot of mega pixels, but 2MP is sufficient.

I am also, unfortunately, on a very tight budget, and this is my third digital camera. I wanted to use the camera to get pics for my website, so I would reduce them to 800x600 anyway, so I figure a 2MB should be OK. The main reason for getting a 3MB camera is that you can crop the results. I was a bit worried about the long time it takes to take a picture (according to the serious reviews), but in fact I did not find this to be a problem. I am not into action photography, but for those of you who are, the A70 is faster. Pros:Full of features (P, Tv, Av, M etc, etc), even has an output to the TV. The manual does not explain these features, so I tended to stick with program mode.Not too small and the controls are nice, it does take 4 batteries, but that is OK with me.Five zone focussing system, impressed by that.AF assist meaning that you can focus in the dark, loved thatGood colour rendition, nice that. Exposure was perfect.View finder zooms, this is important for composing an image in full sun because the LCD monitor is hard to see with the sun behind you.Good battery life, I got 175 shots with alkalines, the current rechargeable NI-MH batteries will give you at least twice that.Lens is covered up when camera switch off, important to keep the dust out.Takes nice indoor flash pics, as long as the autofocus system grabs hold of the subject you get fantastic shots, if it does not be prepared for an out of focus shot. On average 4 out of five flash shots were very good.Uses compact flash memory which is cheap (you need a 64 or 128 MB card)A 64MB card will take 60 pics in superfine and 120 in fine mode at 1600x1200Can stitch pictures together to get a panorama shot.As a SLR user there was a reassuring 'click' when it takes a picture.There are wide-angle and zoom accessories, I like landscape photography. Cons:Images could not pick up the detail of difficult subjects like a leafless tree in winter or berries on a bush or tiles on a roof. This was using ISO 50 and superfine mode on a sunny winter day.Lens only goes to F8 which means that using shutter speed priority a bit difficult.Cannot focus easily on a bush (probably the same on most AF cameras).I knew the image processing software was [bad], but I use Thumbs Plus software, so I do not care. For the money, you get a lot of bang for the buck. I was pleased at the indoor shots using flash, my dad came out great and so did the books in my bookcase (these were stunning, better than my SLR). But, I was quite disappointed at the lack of detail in some difficult outdoor subjects, and this is where the rubber hits the road. Unfortunately, I cannot compare it to other digicams (Olympus C-350, Sony DSC-P72), so I do not know whether the lack of detail is due to the lens or the sensor, I suspect the former. The bottom line for me is that this cheap digicam produces better pictures for my website than my SLR, because by the time I have converted film or slides to jpg files, I lose so much quality, that I am better off with a cheap digicam.Overall, it is amazing value for money and Amazon was the cheapest, but you know that anyway.

Many problems owners have with the camera can be easily solved or answered by reading the instruction book! Take the time to do this! For the price, this digital camera packs a bundle of great features and it's a great camera to grow with. The auto setting gives terrific results and as one grows and expands their photographic expertise, there are plenty of manual controls to experiment and fiddle around with.

Quick at saving the picture to memory card 4. Because it has 4 batteries, you don't have to change them very often Cons: 1.

After my 2-month investigation I've chosen Canon A60.This camera provides all of this. CompactFalsh memory card is very reliable, fast and most cheeper comparing with other flash memory standarts. Personally I don't like Fuji/Olympus xD cards, because they are motiveless expensive and readable only by the camera (unlike CompactFlash which can be inserted in virtually any cardreader).  This camera is reliable, it has elaborate design, not bad LCD display. All pictures I store in maximum resolution and minimal compression. It is nice that this camera \"super fine\" compression quality  (minimal compression) produce no visible JPEG artifacts, almost like TIFF. Weaknesses of this camera: The quality of pictures not good enough. Sunny pictures are really good.  But I think any camera in this price-range will have similar color noise. Only ISO 50 and 100  are suitable, other modes produce noisy pictures. I never use AUTO mode. Instead I predefined P-mode with my favorite settings or Av-mode. Along the edges pictures sometimes are a little bit blackouted. But this drawback is typical for compact camera designs. Quality of video mode is average (both video and sound suck). And as already was mentioned, the battery life indicator is absolutely stupid. After it becomes blinking you can take only 2-3 pictures. There is no way to forecast and plan recharge. Canon, what happened?! May first cell phone had much more informative indicator for the same type of acc batteries. Shame on you!It upset me to learn that you cannot upload any files on this camera, unlike Sony and many other cameras. Software (for me as software developer) is not perfect too: it is good-looking but not very handy and intuitive. At least for windows user. I admit it is more friendly to Mac users. I think software is not a strong point of Canon. Its a pity, seems like they are trying to save on software.Summary. This is not bad camera for my 270$ spent on it. I like that it has manual controls (although I rare use this feature) and use of CompactFlash memory. For point-and-shoot men and others who dosn't consider these as advantages I recommend to consider other brands.
