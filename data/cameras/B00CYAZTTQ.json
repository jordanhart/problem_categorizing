I have always refused because he has already drowned three phones and there was no way I was letting him near my camera.  The Olympus Tough is the perfect answer to our dilemma. It is waterproof and shockproof.  He has already taken it out on it's first kayak ride, dunked it below the water line and taken pictures.  He is very pleased and so am I.  The only problem is the buttons are very small and it took him some time to figure them all out and be able to use them.

This camera performed great. It took great underwater pictures and videos. It even got dropped around a bit and did not get damaged. I had a lot of fun trying out all the different settings this camera had to offer.The only downside is that the battery indicator is not very accurate. The battery itself had a great life as we only needed to charge it twice in the entire week (which we were constantly using it), but it went from half charged to dead on the meter in about an hour.I would definitely recommend this camera and for the price it's a great deal.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "good buy", "Author": "CHI", "ReviewID": "R2XVVHTHM2YTQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "works pretty well, brought it to the pool, waterpart and took tons of pics and all pics looks great, good.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera - held up to snorkeling in Bora Bora", "Author": "Erin E. Turowski", "ReviewID": "R1U2JGBG99HVIA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take on my honeymoon in Tahiti and Bora Bora, knowing that we would be taking a snorkeling trip with sharks and stingrays.  I was not disappointed!For a reasonable price, I got a snappy little camera that I can literally take anywhere.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this camera has a 5X optical zoom (which is a nice feature in a waterproof point-and-shoot camera) and lots of nice pre-set modes.  I used the \"pop art\" and \"HDR\" modes a lot on vacation to capture some of the colors of the tropics.  The carrying case is nice, too - slim, sleek, and functional, with a handy wrist strap.But, if you are looking at this camera, you are probably the most curious about its underwater capabilities.  Well, this camera delivers!  I took so many GORGEOUS pictures of tropical fish underwater - this camera did an awesome job capturing colors and taking pictures in low light settings.  I recommend using the \"beach\" or \"underwater\" modes, because my underwater pictures in the \"auto\" mode came out a bit blurry.  The rest of the pictures were wonderful, though - I posted some sample images in the image gallery ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00CYAZTTQ/ref=cm_cmu_up_thanks_hdr ).Overall, I really like this camera.  It is solid and reliable underwater, and it also takes great pictures on land.  I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for an affordable point-and-shoot underwater camera.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Only been a few weeks but very pleased", "Author": "SFAGradStudent", "ReviewID": "R2FEPXFEBL9GVV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had an Olympus for 9 years and was very pleased with it, and the only reason it broke was because I dropped it.
