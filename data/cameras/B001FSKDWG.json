Chandrasekar", "ReviewID": "R20V0KLHMC0PQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those who don't know, the Panasonic G1 is the first (of hopefully many) camera that adheres to the new micro 4/3 format.  What is so exciting about it?  All SLR cameras use mirrors, prisms, and optical viewfinders so that the photographer can see what his/her subject \"through the lens.\"  SLRs have remained the defacto standard for most serious photographers because most find the whole viewfinder concept so appealing.  The micro 4/3 does away with the mirrors and prisms, and replaces the optical viewfinder of SLRs with an electronic viewfinder.  This allows the cameras that adhere to the standard to be much smaller (and wideangle lenses designed for this mount to be smaller as well).  Onto the real review...The EVF on the G1 is the first that I've seen that is remotely usable.  While not as good as the OVF in my 5D, it is considerably better than the OVF in my older 350D.  The first look through the EVF will impress anyone who hasn't used a Full-Frame camera before.  While there is a noticeable lag (particularly when moving the camera around...a delay of a 10th of a second maybe), the fact that you can see a live histogram in the VF makes the lag completely worthwhile.  Even better, the VF can increase the gain of the screen in darker conditions so you can actually see what you are shooting (it does get grainy, but it is better than seeing nothing at all).  Finally, when you engage Manual Focus, the view in the EVF zooms in on your subject automatically which allows for perfect manual focus adjustments every time!!  Without a doubt, this is the best interchangeable lens camera on the market if you are interested in manually focusing.The articulating LCD is another design choice that is spot-on!!  Why haven't other manufacturers caught on that \"live view\" is completely useless without an articulating LCD?  Switching from the LCD to the EVF is as simple as putting your eye next to the viewfinder.  There is a sensor there that detects when it is being used.  The LCD doesn't have the super resolution of the new 5DMkII or the D700, but it has twice the resolution of my older 5D.So is the camera pocketable?  Not a chance.  However, it isn't much bigger than the larger (with its kit lens) than modern superzoom Point&Shoot; cameras.  I bought it because I found that I was leaving my 5D (with 24-70 f/2.8) at home more often than not because i didn't want to carry so much weight.  The G1, in comparison, is a joy to hold and carry.  For me, the size is just right.  Any smaller and the controls would be unusably small.  Any larger and the camera would begin to resemble smaller DSLRs.  Side Note:  The kit lens has to be seen to be believed...it is SO small.  Even the 45-200 lens (90-400) isn't much bigger than kit lenses for APS-C or FF cameras (let alone comparing it to the monstrous 100-400 lens that canon makes).Noise is reasonable.  I wouldn't go past ISO1250 for prints with the G1.  ISO1600 and 3200 are more than useable for web viewing (which is how a majority of my pics are displayed).  I never really understood how printable ISO6400 prints are suddenly required for every camera...how many people actually print a large number of images anyways?  Downsized to Facebook or Picasaweb sizes, I would imagine that a ISO6400 G1 image would be more than adequate.What I don't like is the lack of any large aperture lenses for the format.  You can buy adapters to use standard 4/3 lenses but the older 4/3 lenses are likely larger than their future micro43 counterparts (and AF doesn't work with many of them).  Adapters also exist for Leica M mount (I'm trying to convince my fiance that leica lenses are a better investment than the stock market right now...but I don't think that she is buying it).  The depth of field for micro43 is already larger due to the smaller sensor so it will be hard to get subject isolation in photographs until large aperture prime lenses become available.I'm really excited about the future of this format.  Panasonic has promised a G1HD someone in the first half of this year (a G1 with video capabilities).  In addition, 3 new lenses have been announced:  a 7/14 f/4, a 14-140, and best of all a 20 mm f/1.7 pancake!  Olympus also showed off a concept of a micro43 camera that looked no bigger than a small point&shoot.;  The future is exciting!", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very competent consumer camera -  also can handle Leica M lenses", "Author": "Bo Lorentzen \"Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R258HBXRF4XSJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic G1 is a much debated camera, the first micro 4:3 camera.As a professional photographer I was intrigued with the electronic viewfinder, and also the light weight and compact size, and figured it would be a great gift for my girlfriend. I received the camera about 1 week after the US release. Until now it have worked flawlessly, the battery last well through a day with power to spare. To be clear, I am not talking a studio work day, but my girlfriend putting 300 frames on the camera in a day.We already own 4:3 cameras and she picked it up and worked with it instantly, no learning curve required. The camera is well laid out and controls are positioned where you would expect to find them.Electronic Viewfinder.The most unusual part of the camera is the EVF (Electronic View Finder) which instead of a optical system literally have a display, but unlike typical \"super zoom\" EVF cameras which have a low-rez viewfinder, this camera have a HD viewfinder, this means you can actually see what is in focus in the image, the screen also have a very quick refresh, so you do not have the feeling of waiting for the screen.  (unlike previous EVF cameras you can exchange lenses on the G1)I originally questioned the EVF system concept for a SLR, but once I got the camera in hand the viewfinder have proved to work very well.  Panasonic have developed this technology to a point where this camera is possible and very functional.Lenses:Panasonic is launching this camera with 2 lenses and more to come, for years Panasonic have received design help from Leica, and this show in the quality of the lenses, the standard kit lens is a great lens.Olympus created the 4:3 system, Panasonic is a partner in this system.  Thankfully the G1 being a micro-4:3 camera can accept both m43 lenses but with a adapter also all previous 4:3 system lenses.  This mean you have access to exotic lenses from 600mm to 8mm.  The dedicated zoom for m43 are VERY compact... however this is meaningless if you have a serious need for a 300mm f2.8 lens as there would be no size difference, so you would not save weight or space by using a dedicated m4:3 lens.  Panasonic recognizes this and have launched the camera with a couple of outstanding lenses which are great everyday zooms, this is the ones you will want for family photography (including some family sports photography), but it is good to know that if you get the urge for photographing lions in Africa the camera will accept ultra fast lenses such as the sexy 150mm 2.0 low light tele-lens from olympus.We already own a large selection of 4:3 system lenses, including the 8mm ultra wide and all of these work with the adapter on the G1.Image stabilization:Panasonic lenses have GREAT stabilization and the camera takes tack-sharp images at incredible low light.However there is kinky point for me which you should be aware about,  Panasonic have chosen to use in-lens stabilization, where Olympus uses in-camera stabilization. THIS is the biggest weakness in cross system compatibility.  Thanksfully Panasonic have a good collection of Leica designed lenses which is stabilized, but for owners of Olympus lenses (such as myself) one should realize that Olympus lenses will not be stabilized on the G1 (not that you are likely to hand-hold a 600mm tele lens, but you should know).Image quality is above expectation.The images are simply outstanding, in both color, exposure and details, I say this as the owner of several pro DLSR and Leica M8 cameras.  (well lets get real here. Clearly the camera do not compare to a $5000 camera, nobody would expect that, but at the $700 price its in a class by itself. you will be hard pressed to find a better camera for under $1000). The bottom line on image quality is this camera will not let you down, you can share pictures with friends and feel good about the image quality.LEICA M lenses.Most interesting for me was the ability to mount Leica M lenses with a adapter on the Panasonic G1.  I have been shooting images with the 35mm lux and 75mm lux.  As it turns out the G1 works best with longer lenses, 28mm tend to get soft edges when using Leica M film lenses, this is because of the way these lenses were made and not a problem with the camera. Naturally this does not apply to use of Panasonic or Olympus lenses on this camera.Bottom line.A revolutionary new camera, combining traditional single-lens photography with modern technology.  Its a favorite walk about camera, light weight and comfortable in the hand.Camera is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,", "Date": "February 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, finally a little camera alternative", "Author": "Kachadurian", "ReviewID": "R3O6TW2UXBE5UE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a professional photographer and I have looked for a perfect take-it-anywhere camera since I abandoned my Nikon 28Ti when I stopped shooting film. I have had everything in the small camera class from the original Nikon Cp950 to the Panasonic LX3. I had Canon G9 &10s, the Pro-1, various Fujis and a Ricoh compact. None of them came close to delivering the sort of image I get from a real DSLR. For a while I used a Canon Rebel TXi, but it just wasn't a size savings because the lenses are so big.Enter the G1. It's very small, but still easy to use and hold steady. The lenses are tiny. You can use Leica-M lenses with a cheap adapter. The image quality is right there with a DSLR. Not quite as good as a Canon 5D at ISO 800, but fully useable at everything up to 1600 ISO. The G1 at 800 is better than the G10 at 100.I highly recommend this camera to any serious photographer looking for a small, high quality alternative to a big DSLR with way better quality than even the best small sensor camera.Tom Kachadurian", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "This camera is just right.", "Author": "Big Country", "ReviewID": "R30PZ8R2OZCEEP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had decided I wanted to step up to an entry level DSLR camera.  So I started looking and had settled on the new Canon Rebel T1i at first.  I bought the camera, took it home and started snapping a bunch of pictures with it only to discover that at full size, the pictures were a little soft.  For a $900 camera, that wasn't something I wanted to deal with.  Yes, I'm aware the pictures can be doctored after the fact but I don't want to have to do that with the majority of my pictures.So I returned the T1i and started considering the Nikon D5000, Pentax K20D, Olympus E620 and the Panasonic G1.  The K20D is a very nice camera but was just a little too big for my liking.  After handling the Olympus E620 I just didn't come away very impressed (just didn't feel good in my hand).  I really liked the Nikon D5000 and gave that camera very serious consideration.  However at the end of the day, the G1 just felt really good in my hand and impressed me with its features.  I'll list specifics next.The things that sold me on the G1 are as follows:1.  Camera is small size and fits well in my hand2.  Terrific articulating LCD with great resolution3.  Super fast auto focus in live view mode, best I have seen4.  Has all the control and features of most entry level DSLRs5.  Takes terrific pictures6.  Relatively fast operation7.  The \"rubber like\" texture of the camera body feels good8.  Performs well in low light and small pictures up to ISO 1600 are usable although not quite as good as the best entry level DSLRs9.  Electronic View Finder is very clear10.  Auto focus assist lightOf course there are some Cons as well:1.  Low light performance not quite as good as best entry level DSLRs. Although this should be expected with the smaller sensor.2.  Would be nice if the flash popped up automatically3.  Limited selection of lenses since the micro four thirds format is so new4.  Is easy to block the auto focus assist light while holding the camera5.  White Balance indoors under fluorescent lighting is poor.  However you can manually adjust this.6.  It's expensive in stores (I paid more than I care to admit), although Amazon's price is reasonable in my opinion and a more logical price point.  It is worth the $650 price.The cons I've listed are actually minor.  It really is a great camera and I'm very happy I decided to go with it.  I have always liked Panasonic's picture quality.  Especially if there is lots of light I have found that Panasonic cameras take as good a picture as anything else out there.  It's a great handling camera that has all the performance of the entry level DSLRs without the bulk.  I'm anxious to see what the future has in store for the micro four thirds format.If you are looking for a camera that is a little smaller than the entry level DSLRs but has all the performance, this is the camera for you.  Its live view performance is top notch and the image quality is impressive (even DPreview spoke highly of the G1's image quality).  I'm anxious to get the 45-200mm zoom lens to see how it performs also.", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "kicks butt", "Author": "Shenanalysis", "ReviewID": "R3T8NUP896TD4F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've done 35mm slr photography for 30 yrs and have now used the Panasonic G1 for six months. After a lot of shooting, my assessment is that the G1 kicks butt.  I converted my old Konica Hexanon lenses to use with it, which give great image quality and less depth of field than the standard zoom lens. The standard lens itself is sharp as a tack and small. The viewfinder is amazing for one that does not use a mirror reflex system. I purchased an Olympus ultra-wide zoom that performs nicely on the G1 (with Panasonic adapter).  Auto-focus on the Olympus is excellent.  The camera is easy for a novice to use in programmed modes, but allows amazing control when shifted to manual. I had been unable to use my old manual focus Hexanon lenses due to eye deterioration, but the G1's manual focus assist, which zooms the viewfinder, enables me to focus precisely once again.  The only negative is that certain autofocus settings/combinations can slow the camera down, but this is remedied with experimentation.  It's still not as rapid as high dollar SLRs.  The size is an amazing advantage over such cameras though, if you don't want to carry something heavy and obtrusive.  After a lot of use, I am a big fan.", "Date": "May 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Bang for the Buck", "Author": "Howard Butler MD", "ReviewID": "R2825VL4JGVH55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome.  Bought it for my daughter to teach her photography and was absolutely blown away by its output.  It has the best dynamic range per $ I have ever encountered.  What a treat.I shoot with a Canon 1DsMKIII and MKIII and must say that DR is as good as my MKIII, which to date I have considered the best.  Of course one needs to put that comment into perspective as the G1 is no MKIII nor does it have the pro features or capabilities.But for those looking for an \"entry\" level DSLR on a \"budget\" this is the one.Yeah, it doesn't have built in video, which is the new craze, but if you don't need it big deal.  My main complaint with this camera is the electronic viewfinder, which needs lots and lots of improvement.Controls are well laid out for the beginner or advanced photographer, auto-bracketing and bracketing in general a snap.  With HDR I tend to use AB much more often than I did and this camera makes it a snap.  While there are those who will argue about HDR, for me it is a must and the ease of AB is a big concern for me.In summary, this new technology, is awesome with better and better things on the horizon.  You won't be sorry buying this camera; whether you are looking for an entry level DSLR or a light weight carry around to supplement your high end gear it will be hard to put this thing down once you see its awesome images pop up on your computer screen.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "A New World", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"schex86\"", "ReviewID": "R3JGKTXZG2R45Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The G1 is my first interchangeable lens, large sensor, electronic view finder camera. Or, in simpler terms, its my first DSLR. Yeah, it doesn't have the mirror, but most people don't really know what SLR refers to anyway, so I usually don't bother explaining.Let me first say that the main reason I bought this was my disappointment with just about every point and shoot camera's low light performance. I was sick of using the flash in every indoor situation, and usually getting crappy photos. And in this department, the G1 delivers as I have been more than satisfied with its performance up to ISO 800. Above that, and the grain can start to become an issue, but even 1600 is very usable. As it stands, I can now capture family moments that were previously out of reach. But don't take my word for it, read the review at the \"dpreview\" website to see how it stacks up against other entry level SLRs like the Canon Rebels and Nikon D60 or D90. Its performance is on par with all of these and better in some cases.Regarding the settings, they are as advanced as you want them to be. For those desiring simplicity, simply set the camera to Intelligent Auto mode and click away. You'll get a message if you need to open the flash, but other than that, no worries.For someone like me, who enjoys tweaking, the menus are very adequate, and I appreciate the large variety of options available. For instance, in manual mode you can freely adjust ISO, aperture, shutter, etc. and see a readout showing what the expected exposure value (EV) will be. You can also switch to Live View and the camera will display sample images every second to help you understand what exactly your final photo will look like using the current settings, and will adjust accordingly as you change them. 90% of the settings can be adjusted directly on screen using the Quick Menu button, and the menu system itself can be navigated very efficiently using the scroll wheel.The provided lens is good for most situations, and if you need extended range, get the very good Panasonic 45-200mm f/4.0-5.6 Lumix G Vario MEGA OIS Zoom Lens for Panasonic Digital SLR Cameras. I have both, and I've definitely been able to take pictures with the zoom lens that I might not normally have considered. I'm now taking pictures of birds and just about anything else that will hold still long enough for me to snap it.The viewfinder is excellent in normal light, and allows you to view a live histogram which can help you take better shots. Its performance does suffer (grain, lower frame rate) in low light, but as far as I'm concerned, this serves as a reminder that you'll need to do something else, such as open the flash or adjust the shutter speed, if you want a decent picture. Regardless, the viewfinder works adequately in just about any condition.The LCD is excellent as well and the fact that it swivels in just about every direction gives you lots of flexibility. Not only can you take much better self portraits, but you can be a lot less conspicuous too. No longer do you have to hold the camera glued to your face or directly at eye-level, standing out like a sore thumb. I can hold it in my lap or at waist level, tilt the LCD facing up, and take pictures at will while only appearing to be fiddling with the controls. This works on family and strangers too. Have fun snapping...Needless to say, I'll be demanding a fully articulated LCD on any SLR-like camera I purchase in the future. But for now, this camera has opened up a whole new world for me, at least when it comes to photography, though I do wish it had video, but I won't hold that against it. If you really need video, wait for the GH1 coming out later this year, which I'm sure will be much more expensive. As for the G1, I'm glad I got it for only [...] bucks last month.

For about a year and a half that has been a panasonic lx-3. I love the lx-3, especially the fast wide lens, but like all point and shoots it has it's limitations - the biggest one is the tiny sensor. I have been watching the parade of micro 4/3 cameras and figured that the g1 would be a good replacement for the lx-3. It has everything that i was looking for in a replacement - much larger size sensor, interchangeable lens, articulating lcd and while it's larger than the lx-3 it's still much smaller than a full size dslr (nikon d200).After having it for about a month and using it as my carry everywhere camera i have mixed feelings about the camera. There is definitely things to like about it but there are also things that i have a real problem with. It's dynamic range is not as large as a dslr, especially in the highlights and if i use the multi metering pattern it will blow out the highlights quite often. Another let down is it's overall speed, i was looking forward to something that would be closer to my d200, but unfortunately it's no faster than an lx-3, except the focus speed which is much faster than any point and shoot.I can get over the speed and with a fast card it's not really that bad, but the metering system is something that really annoys me. Now, i frequently  had to adjust the exposure compensation on my lx-3 but it was usually overexposing it to open up the shadows. Maybe i'm just not used to metering systems that have a tendency to overexpose but i find it annoying and really debated returning the camera and may have if i hadn't filled out the registration card (doh!). I am still on the fence and may end up selling it but for now i am using it (with an almost constant use of exposure compensation and sometimes spot meter and ae lock) and it's getting easier as i get a bit more used to the quirks of this camera, but i have not abandoned my search for the perfect (for me) carry everywhere camera.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great compact interchangeable lens camera", "Author": "C.

It is so tight and compact and it has done an excellent job under a variety of conditions.The camera records very detailed images and is able to maintain that detail at lower shutter speeds in despite of the O.I.S. The white balance appears excellent on the LCD but has not been great under certain conditions which have been easily corrected.Focus is quick, battery life is good, color rendition is quite good and there is not much more to ask for when looking to complement a pro SLR. This camera can go where you want without the liability or the excess weight and it takes superb images. The tests will prove it.Printed images should be good. It has been skiing in the Alps and the images have needed almost nothing. White balance is good when you don't have to think to hard about it or when a camera is consistent. The color rendition of skin tones under a variety of conditions is excellent and that includes the flash. The contrast detect AF is great but has not been tested with bursts or ultra low light.

These are large, heavy cameras made even heavier with their associated lenses. So they're not really suitable for taking along on trips and vacations unless the purpose of the trip is photography.I've owned many small point & shoot type cameras, including Canon's G7 and G9, the Olympus C-5060 (great camera) and several others. They're ok in good light and good for small, snapshot prints. But they're no match for the kinds of images I routinely get with my pro cameras.The Panasonic G1 is the first small sensor camera I've owned that comes very, very close to my bigger cameras in terms of IQ, noise levels (ISO 100-800), color fidelity, tonality and overall photographic integrity. I could cite the limitations of the camera or areas where its design could be improved, but I won't. It's not important. What's important is that the Panasonic G1  and its kit lens are both top-quality products capable of producing images I'm proud to call my own. For the first time since migrating to digital, I can say without hesitation that I'm totally confident I can take this camera along on a trip and that I'll come back with high-IQ images printable to very large sizes.I've not used Olympus' versions of Micro Four Thirds nor have I held or tried Panasonic's other MFT cameras, but I think it's safe to assume that their IQ is similar. The major difference with the G1 (and Panasonic's GH1) is the DSLR-like handling, built-in viewfinder, articulating LCD screen (an important consideration for me) and image stabilization built into the lenses.Great cam.

The camera body is well thought out - I have small hands and that helps. The functions are many and most are easily accessible. I am amazed at all the user friendly options like the histogram reading taken beforehand visible on the LCD or through the viewfinder; the clear LCD and Viewfinder; the ease at which settings can be changed using the LCD; being able to view beforehand what the image will look like in terms of color and lighting and making changes on the spot,etc. Its also a cute, discrete camera and seems durable. There is a lot to learn and I would not recommend this for beginners unless they just use the auto settings and scene modes. I am eager for more lenses to be introduced. Panasonic seems to move slowly in this regard. The system needs a wide angle and a macro though converters can be bought and used with other maker's lenses which is great. The kit lens does a reasonable job. Images are sharp edge to edge and clear for the most part and there is not much chromatic aberration. Though it is not a macro lens, close ups are possible and come out well. The silky pix software is awkward so I use Adobe Lightroom for RAW files and then finish them in Adobe Photoshop.

When compared to the d700 you can see the G1 doesnt have the same sort of brick like construction quality, it is much more plasticy and doesnt have as many controls to hand. The upside of this is that its about 1/2 of the weight of the d700 with lens and in fact a large part of my decision to buy the G1 was because of its small size.When I compared it to cameras at the more compact end such as the \"super zooms\" I found the G1 had a physically larger sensor and better picture quality. There was also a real lens up front with ability to change lenses. Also, superior access to deeper parameters like ISO, white balance, focus and exposure modes easily. The downside here is the G1 costs a bit more than similar \"super zoom\", though I am amazed at the differences in prices sellers are asking for it. I paid about 20% more than my girlfriends top of the range compact which I felt was worth it.So I wanted something much lighter than my d700 but still with lots of ability to fiddle with parameters. I have not been disappointed in this camera, its great fun to use. Setting of most functions require only one or two button presses and scroll of the wheel. I love the small size and reduced weight. Although the electronic viewfinder sacrifices some naturalness you get used to it pretty quick and it has the ability to do things you cant with a SLR viewfinder. These include ability to preview the effects of changes to aperture and shutter speed which is great for lower light shooting. You can also see how much image blurring will occur with slower shutter speeds, and also preview depth of field. When travelling in dodgy places I also feel less self conscious pulling this camera out in public, and feel less likely to get mugged!Ive noticed some reviewers have marked this camera down as being too complex and I feel this is not a fault of the camera. It would be different if the camera were poorly laid out but its not, one button press will give you access to a whole range of parameters, its hard to fault. Little things are annoying like when you want to delete a photo you have to press the delete button then press a scroll right button to choose 'yes\" and then press a \"menu set\" button to confirm. So thats 3 different buttons. On my d700 you just press the delete button, get asked OK? and then press again. Much less finger moving around. These little details are what distinguish higher end cameras but this is a minor quibble.More obscure parameters need more button pressing but this camera is no worse than even the d700. If you are not interested in learning about what goes into a photograph then I would agree the ability to tweak settings will be unnecessary and intimidating and you would be better off with a more preset oriented camera. Then again, the G1 has about 8 scene presets, so at minimum you can just point and shoot. This is good when you want to hand your camera over to a non-camera friendly stranger or friend to use without baffling them.To sum up, this camera was a compromise for me between the high end picture quality of my d700 and the need for something more lightweight, compact and less obtrusive, but still with enough sophistication to allow tweaking and user input into the photo.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Like a point'n'shoot(but better)!; great customer support from Amazon", "Author": "Christopher Choi", "ReviewID": "R3CQXBB88D3CU2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a budding photographer;I get all the jargon(rule of thirds is my new word of the day) and stuff but I really haven't shot too many photos yet,but I've done enough shots with my PowerShot 590IS to realize the limitations of a point and shoot.I felt I was ready to make the step to a big boy camera.I wanted the picture quality/low noise of a DSLR while not being encumbered with something like even a Nikon D90, while having the ease of shooting of a point and shoot. oh, and interchangeable lenses.(That got rid of the PowerShot G10)The Lumix G1 fit the bill. It's a true joy to shoot with; even at full auto(intelligent auto, as they call it) pictures are AMAZING!I handed the camera to some of my friends with no photo experience, and they took shots that I would be proud to frame.Yes, once you leave the land of automatic, the menu options are quite complex, but a little bit of RTFM never hurt anyone :)and yes, the autofocus is very fast,you can poke around the web to see the reviews, but I can personally say that the autofocus does rival a SLR's autofoucus.The viewfinder is very nifty, you can review pictures on it due to it being electronic, perfect when its too sunny to see on the beautiful main LCD;it can do everything the regular LCD can. It is also very sharp and the colors are jaw-dropping,it does 800x600 at 60fps.However, there is tearing when you move the camera too quickly and occasional rainbow effects, due to the viewfinder being based on projection technology,LCoS to be precise(note: I have extreme sensitivity to the rainbow effect,and LCoS/DLP is very susceptible to it)The main problems are price and the lens selection;the D5k and the XSi are very close in terms of price($630ish of 9/09), while offering video and the ability to use the huge selection of Nikor or Canon EF-S lenses,respectively. I particularly miss a nice fast macro. However, if this is going to be your secondary camera or you have simple needs(no wildlife or sports, for example), the current selection of lenses may fit your needs. I am personally switching to the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 pancake when it is available separately(With the 4/3's crop factor of 2, 35mm equivalency is 40mm). In addition, with the release of the GF1, Panasonic is releasing new lenses like the aforementioned pancake and a legit macro \"made\" by Leica(90mm equivalent).In summary:Pros:Easy to use/great auto modeLCD is fully articulating, you can do easy self-shots :)Best live view out thereFast autofocus(rivals the SLRs)Good quality pics, gives the competing SLRs (and even the D90)a run for their moneycomfortable gripsmall sizekit lens is good quality and very small(unbelievably so)OVER 9000 adapters for lenses out there(from Oly OM to Leica M), due to Four-Thirds being an \"open\" standard.Overlay on the EVF is genius, no need to look at the main LCD to see f-stops, shutter speeds, shots on card, battery life ,etc like on real SLRsCons:(These are all really little nitpicks, and the only con that has been a problem at all is the battery life)not all 4/3 lenses autofocus4/3 lens adapter is bigpanasonic is still a bit slow with getting the m4/3 lenses outkit lens could be a bit faster but so can Canon and Nikon'sthe Olympus E-420 is around the same size while being a real SLR and allowing you to autofocus with 4/3 lenses and mount them without adapterthe Olympus E-P1(another m4/3 camera with the form factor of a rangefinder camera, but with no flash or viewfinder) autofocses with all 4/3 lenses,while being smaller. oh it also does great video.It's a bit more than the G1 though, $700+. and it is slower at autofocusing.kinda pricey for a non SLRpoor low light performance in comparison to the D5k/XSi(ISO 800+ performance is not all that great, and the viewfinder is grainy/jerky in low light, however it is still bright)VERY POOR BATTERY LIFE in comparison to entry level dSLRs(300 shots is a good day)AEB is limited, 2/3 steps, 7 shots at the most, not too good for HDR.no video.My verdict: If you don't care about video and you don't have OVER 9000 Nikon or Canon lenses and/or you want something that you can carry around without being hindered, this is for you.If you want video or a longer lens, save your pennies for the GH1, it seems to be positioned at the D90's territory with a 14-140 tele lens and a $1400 price tag. The lens separately costs $800, the price difference between the GH1 and the G1. The GH1 autofocuses while shooting video btw. Also, DP Review says that the GH1's sensor is a bit better past ISO 800, in addition to the 1:1 sensor ratio being a nice new feature.Little tidbit: The flash on my G1 died after a couple days, and Amazon sent out a replacement 1st Day Air after I told them I needed it in time for a quickly upcoming vacation, and I didn't even need to send my old one in before they shipped! Panasonic did not budge, they told me to ship my old camera, wait until it makes it to Texas(I live in CA) and then they would replace it...after 10 days...well into my vacation.thanks Amazon!Edit 9/13/09: The GF1(Panasonic's answer to the EP-1,but with the legendary GH autofoucs speed and with a weak pop-up flash) is also a consideration but its very expensive ($900) and it doesn't have an EVF standard.

Morehead", "ReviewID": "R3AVUDHO0MDL74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The main reason I bought this camera was the flip out screen. I used to own a Sony F828 and I loved how you could effortlessly take ground and over-the-head shots with it. Eventually I ended up selling it to buy a Canon DSLR. I have had several Canon DSLRs since then. I love my Canons but I have always missed the ability to shoot from awkward angles and still be able to see the image while I am composing and focusing the shot. Ever since I got this camera I have been trying all sorts of different angles. It makes these types of shots so easy it begs for you to experiment. Once again I am getting shots that would be impossible to get with the DSLR that has a fixed screen. This capability alone is worth the price of the camera. I picked up the Panasonic 20mm 1.7 pancake lens and I love how small this setup is. It looks like a toy so when I am shooting people on the street they never look scared/intimidated. It is much easier to go unnoticed and you can get some very natural looking candids this way. I am still learning all the camera features so it will be a while before I get some great shots with it. But, so far, I have gotten some shots that I am really happy with and I have only had the camera for a week.LikesLooks like a toy so you can take pics in places that don't allow big camera with long lenses-doesn't intimidate your subjects.Full manual control if you need it.Small-allows you to be very discreteFlip out screen-you can try just about any angle you can think of and still be able to see your shot on the back screen. No more guessing like you do with an DSLR.On bright days, you can preview your shots inside the viewfinder.Intelligent auto-fixes darks and lights so you get a shot that comes close to what the human eye sees.Movable focus point to anywhere on the screen or in the viewfinderYou can lock focus on a moving subject (Dog, Baby, etc,,,) and the camera will continue to focus on that subject without you having to hold down the shutter button.Face recognition ensures your pics are properly focused and exposed for the faces.Kit lens has a very useful focal length and it is stabilized.Ability to see the affect of the shutter speed. (push a button to see how the shutter speed will make running water look or see how a moving car or train will look)Push a button to see how your depth of field.The back screen automatically shuts off when you put your eye to the viewfinder.You can turn the back screen around to have it facing in. This protects it when you are not using it.You have all your normal white balance settings plus you get two custom white balance setting. It is very easy to set the white balance manually. Just point the camera at something white and press a button. You can also fine tune a white balance by using the back screen and adjusting a setting in the camera. It is easy to match the screen with what you are seeing live.Lots of screen modes for people that are not comfortable yet with manual controls.You can display different grids in the viewfinder on the back screen for perfect alignment. One of them divides the screen in 9 segments so you can easily use the rule of thirds. Another one divides the screen in 16 squares and has two diagonal lines that meet at the center. This makes it easy to see the exact center of the screen.Movable histogramManual focus assist-turn the manual focus ring and view finder zooms in to show you how precise your focus is. This is very useful. DSRLs can only do this in live view.Auto bracket can be set to 7 shots (-2 to + 2) Very handy for HDR. It makes this process much easier.Controls are easy to learn/use.Film modes (give you lot of different effects) If you shoot raw, you can try different settings after you have taken your photos.Fast auto focusISO 3200 not good for color, but may work well for B&W; images.You can use other 4/3 lenses with an adapter.DislikesProprietary cable to transfer images to your computer-not standard usb 2 cable.Software that comes with it is a bit bizarre. I am going to buy Lightroom.Above ISO 800-noisy-loss of detailFlip out screen would be even better with 920,000. But, it is still better than my 40d!Noisy shutter sound (when using the 20mm 1.7)Can't buy just the body. You have to get the 14-45 kit lens. I would have preferred the 14-140mm lens. But, from what I have read the kit lens is sharper so it will be useful.In closing, I can't stress this enough, the flipout screen REALLY helps to get shots that are almost impossible get with a DSLR. You can easily take pics of kids, dogs, lizards at eye level. Also, you effortlessly shoot from below flowers that are near to the ground. And, you can get over the head shots at concerts!

I'm an aerial photographer and just for fun, I took up a friend's Canon 5DMKII to compare to the little G1.  I was very suprised: both deliver equally crisp shots.  In some cases, the G1 delivered a sharper image, on the detail.  The fact that they were close blew me away, because the pixel count is very different in the two different formats.  The only weak point, if there is one, is that the controls on top tend to get bumped and changed when you're not looking, so it's always a good idea to confirm the settings.

Goldberg", "ReviewID": "R16ONYNXRPJYLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You should know where I coming from. My previous camera was a compact sensor, fixed lens, super-zoom camera (Canon S3 IS). I now own and am very happy with a Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1. I have both the 14-45mm/F3.5-5.6 basic zoom and the 45-200mm/F4-5.6 telephoto zoom.There are two areas where the where the G1 really shines: its electronic viewfinder and its focusing capabilities, both auto and manual. I am old enough and my eyesight poor enough to make an electronic viewfinder superior to an LCD screen or a penta-mirror viewfinder. I also don't like large, heavy cameras. The G1 is only a tad bigger than many point-and-shoot cameras.The G1 viewfinder image is high-resolution, full-time live view. It is like looking at HDTV. All the other electronic viewfinder cameras that I am familiar with produce what look like grainy SDTV images when compared to the G1.Aa for focusing, autofocus on the Canon S3 was slow and it often failed to lock on target. Manual focusing was so difficult as to be a joke. On the G1, both manual focus and autofocus are amazingly good.When using autofocus (AF), the G1's 23 AF points really make a big difference (the S3 has only one). The focus is fast and accurate even in fairly low light situations. The G1 shows you the AF points it is using in the viewfinder. I find that feedback reassuring. The G1 also provides a subject tracking feature that really works. You can focus on a subject, then shift camera to recompose without loosing the focus. No holding down the shutter button halfway or pressing an AF lock button required.As for the manual focus, it simply works as I think it ought to. The lenses have a proper focus ring, and the viewfinder goes into 5x magnification as soon as you start to turn it (you can disable this if you want to). A click on the front mounted control wheel and the magnification goes up to 10x. A second click and the magnification returns to 5x. That's something even high-end DSLRs can't do -- I mean without taking one's eye off the viewfinder and switching to live view. And, yes, the magnification area can be moved around the view frame.I have found the two lenses I have for the G1 give excellent images. It would be nice to have faster lenses, but Panasonic decided to keep the price down rather than market (much) more expensive lenses with larger maximum apertures.In all other respects, the G! performs as well or better than the DSLR cameras in its price range. The G1 is a good choice over its price competitors when having a large, bright, sharp viewfinder image and having first-class focusing capabilities are important purchase criteria.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not enough superlatives for this camera", "Author": "T Boyer \"seattleparent\"", "ReviewID": "R3OH8UCCLO2DIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Added March 2013:By now the sensor in the G1 has been leapfrogged -- first by the Panny G3 (which went to 16 megapixels) and then by the Olympus OM-D (16 megapixels, faster and sharper because it has an extremely thin anti-aliasing filter.)If you want the best M43 camera performance, the OM-D (which we own) is your only choice right now. However, if you need a street shooter for a lot less money, this is still a wonderful camera to carry around. In fact I've sold a G3 because I never liked how it felt and didn't think the pictures were significantly better. I'm not buying the G5 but I will consider the next generation -- probably a G7 -- when it comes out this year.There have been a host of phenomenal prime lenses for the M4/3 family introduced in the last 3 years, so I use the 14-45 zoom a lot less. The Panny 14 and 20, the Olympus 45 and 75, are reasonable priced and all simply wonderful, especially the Oly for portraits.Between the lenses and the advance in sensors, there is absolutely no reason to lug around a crop-sensor DSLR (Sorry Canon and Nikon). Unless you need some specialized lens, or you shoot a lot of indoor sports, you won't get better images than the OM-D or the latest Panny G series unless you step all the way up to full frame.If you read photography forums, you will see thousands of references to photographers -- including some pros -- who are finally giving up their DSLR gear for M43 because they can get the same quality images with much less weight and expense. As rapidly as M43 technology is developing, the next generation is going to challenge full frame for most kinds of shooting (i.e. if you don't need to print giant poster sized images at 300 dpi)It is an exciting time; M43 has a very bright future. The G1 is the camera that started the whole mirrorless camera revolution -- but more importantly it is still, after all these years, a lovely camera to walk around town with.-------------------------------------------Added November 2010:I've had the G1 for about 18 months now and my admiration has continued to grow and grow. I like to shoot architecture and print 13x19, so resolution and detail are critically important. The G1 with its kit 14-45 is just fantastic -- buy it while you still can. Be cautious about newer models because it is hard to improve upon this camera and very possible to do worse.I recently purchased the Canon T2i, the most advanced consumer DSLR on the market, with an 18 megapixel APS-C sensor, and even with highly rated lenses -- even stopped down -- the T2i has not been able to capture any more detail than the G1 when shooting outdoors. I'm still preferring the G1's images.Obviously the T2i can do some things the G1 can't -- low light and sports, for instance. But for the kind of photography I do, walking-around-outside photography, cityscapes, landscapes and well lit snaps, I believe you'd have to go to all the way to a full frame DSLR ($2500 and up for just the body) to get significantly better image quality, and even then it wouldn't matter unless you're printing posters. My daughter and I had a great time shooting the ceiling of Florence's 13th century Baptistry -- capturing detail 150 feet up without artificial light in a dimly lit interior, focus assist and OIS giving you sharp, croppable images at 200mm. Just mind-bogglingly good.The G1's sensor and kit lens are first rate, but I think maybe the secret to this camera is the hardware-software integration. The Panasonic processor is tuned to automatically compensate for the inevitable distortions produced by the glass. So you see very little barrel distortion or edge softness. The in-the-lens image stabilization system is extremely good, too -- you pretty much can leave it on full time and it will dramatically improve sharpness for slower shutter speeds.A couple of other things about the G1 that are still thrilling after 18 months:1) Manual focus assist. Since the camera focuses through a high res electronic viewfinder, when you want to focus manually, it can automatically do a digital zoom to help you focus at long range. Most DSLRs will give you the blinking light/beep to help you focus, but that's still depending on the camera to focus for you. If you only want to trust your eyes, focus assist is an amazing feature. When I'm using the Lumix 45-200 telephoto (also an excellent lens), focus assist is an amazing help.2) For people who like to do HDR photography, the auto-exposure-bracketing functionality is generous and better than most consumer DSLRs. You can shoot up to 7 frames up to 2/3 of an F stop apart, giving you a good sample of images to feed into Photomatix. I'm bracketing constantly to help preserve what would otherwise be blown out highlights in outdoor shooting. I would never consider a Nikon DSLR today because they dumbed down their exposure bracketing, making it almost unusable, since the D50. Canon is only slightly better.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You may have noticed, this is a really hot camera among serious photogs that has sold out a lot of places. It is functionally similar as the much more expensive (and slightly smaller GX1). After a trip to Italy to give this camera its first workout, I'd like to offer an amended (and more informed review)1)Wonderful feature set. At times bewildering to this amateur. There are so many ways to capture images that will produce different results depending on what you're trying to accomplish.2)Excellent lenses and image quality. The 200mm (equiv to like a 400mm) telephoto is really fun and the basic 14-45 (equiv to 32-90) is an outstanding \"street shooter.\"3)The default settings on this camera are really nice and the JPGs are really quite close to RAW -- no great need to shoot RAW but you can. No over-punching colors like Canon does. Images are really true to what you actually saw. Panasonic sometimes underexposes slightly but I'd rather have that than blown out highlights.4)HDR functionality is excellent. It will autobracket exposure with a total range 4 fstops. You can go out on the internet and see some of the fantastic HDR images this camera will produce.5)Live viewfinder is a real benefit. I easily forget that it's an electronic viewfinder -- the resolution of the little viewfinder is that good. You can also tilt the larger screen so you can shoot around corners, above crowds etc. Serious photographers who like to play with settings will LOVE being able to see their changes show up as they're lining up the picture.My only criticism of this camera is the autofocus, and it may be just that I haven't spend enough time playing with the focus settings. The default is a 9 or 10 point focus that seems to compromise between the points and you can end up with soft images. The softness may only bother you when you're enlarging to 8x10 prints, but it should be much sharper given the excellent quality of the Zeiko lenses. At times the focusing is perfect -- it's just inconsistent and I haven't figured out the key to it yet.No question about it, this camera, with its large four-thirds sensor and excellent lens (and with software lens correction happening inside the camera), produces better image quality in normal light than ANY compact camera and and some of the entry level DSLRs. Resolution (when the focus is hitting) is comparable to a Canon 450, though low-light performance will not be as good as a DSLR.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "G1 is Awesome - from an Amateur's Perspective", "Author": "James L.

I bought it for primarily backpacking and hiking, as well as canoeing and general photography.  The menus are relatively simple to use.  One unexpected useful feature is the LCD screen rotates out and makes it very simple to take good self portraits - you can see exactly what you are going to get.  Battery life is excellent.  I would say the biggest advantage of this over point and shoot cameras, besides the obvious picture quality, is the speed at which you can snap photos.  I appreciate the anti-slip coating on the body.  It feels very solid and well built.  The roller makes it quick and easy to change from color to B&W.;  I have not even scratched the surface with all of the features - I will leave that to more of an expert.  But being a novice, I really like the useful modes such as \"night portrait\", and \"night landscape\" just to name a couple of the many.  It even has one tailored for taking photos of pets!One feature that I wish the camera came with is the flash does not pop up automatically like some dSLR's that I have used.  The G1 flashes a screen that tells you to open the flash - that could be a possible missed shot.  I also wish the lens cap had a tether instead of being forced to put it in your dirty pocket.  I would have liked if it came with a wrist strap but that is a small add on.  Other disadvantages is the limited availability of lenses and of course, cost.  I think I got mine for $630 with shipping (Thanks Amazon!).  I showed the G1 off to the manager at the local Ritz camera and he was impressed and wish he could get some in the store - so that bodes well for more advanced users.If minimizing weight and bulk is not a concern to you, you could definitely save some money by going to say, the Olympus E420 which was my second choice as it was the smallest and lightest dSLR that I could find. There are many good super-zoom P&S; camera out there also, but I like the ability to switch lenses as I increase my skills and needs.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R8QVT77WFVURY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic Lumix G1 is almost an excellent camera, but its shortcomings make it just very good. If you're moving up from a compact without interchangeable lenses, you will most likely be happy. On the other hand, if your main camera is a DSLR, as mine is, the G1 leaves something to be desired.First, it's quite small compared to a DSLR, and I find it hard and uncomfortable to hold, especially with a longer lens. My hands aren't unusually large, but I still can manage a grip with only three fingers -- my pinky hangs in thin air. This is OK with the image-stabilized 14 - 45 mm kit lenses, but with longer, heavier glass it's difficult to hold it steady. Since one of my reasons for buying the camera was to use my Leica and Pentax manual-focus lenses with adapters -- of course, they are not image-stabilized -- this is more of a problem than it might be for someone using only m4/3 O.I.S. lenses. Yes, I'm asking the G1 to do something it's not really designed for, especially since those old telephotos are heavy and bulky, and really unbalance the camera. But if you're thinking of buying the G1 and lens adapters and giving that old glass in your closet a new lease on life, tone down your expectations, at least re: telephotos.The EVF is much different from an optical finder, and takes some getting used to. But it allows a live histogram in the finder, so you know where your exposure is when you shoot, not while chimping afterwards. And the EVF brightens in low light so you can always see what you're shooting -- the image is grainy in low light, but once you realize that the grain is only in the finder, not on the image, it's OK. When shooting in manual focus with a legacy lens, punching a couple of buttons -- very small ones -- will bring up an enlarged section of the finder, which allows very precise focus. And you can move the enlarged section around to fall on the main subject, handy if the camera's on a tripod. This happens automatically when manual focusing the kit lens. There's also live viewing on the LCD panel, which flips out and twists so you can see it when holding the camera overhead, down low, etc. I am quite happy with the EVF overall.Wide-angle is problematic. Because of the small m4/3 sensor, the effective focal length of any lens is doubled vs. on 35mm, meaning the 14 - 45mm kit lens gives the same angles of view as a 28 - 90mm lens on 35mm. If you like to shoot wide, say with a 20mm on a 35mm camera, you'll need a 10mm lens on the G1 to get the same angle. (Panasonic makes a wide-angle zoom -- I think it's 7 -14mm? -- but it's more than $800.) This is a characteristic of all digital cameras with sensors smaller than a 35mm film frame, but APS-sized models, like Nikon's D300, D90, some Canons, etc., increase effective focal length by only 50% +/-; a 12mm lens acts like an 18mm, which is usually wide enough. On the other hand, if you like to shoot telephoto, you're in luck: Panasonic's 45 - 200mm m4/3 lens gives you the same angles as a 90 -- 400mm lens on 35. So it depends on what you want; I like wide, so this is a big negative for me. Not quite big enough to make me return the camera, but enough that I'm hoping Panasonic (or Olympus -- lenses fit both brands) comes out with a 10mm or 12mm lens soon.The kit lens is very slow, f/3.5 - 5.6. It's usable thanks to O.I.S., but don't expect to use selective focus with the background thrown into a creamy blur. At 45mm f/5.6, depth of field is too great for that. Here's where fast legacy lenses come in handy (but you have to focus them); next time I'll buy the body only and add the 20mm f/1.7 instead of the kit zoom. For walking around taking snapshots, the kit lens is fine. Indoors, image quality is acceptable even when you have to boost ISO to get a fast shutter speed -- but this is not a high-ISO camera. If you like shooting in available darkness, buy a DSLR. Even my D200, whose digital innards are a couple of generations old, is way better, and the newer cameras far outshine it.Finally, the camera is much lighter and easier to carry than a DSLR, but not small enough to keep in your pocket. So it's still swinging on a strap or living in a bag, but doesn't weigh you down quite as much. But it's not a total lightweight, either: You still know there's a camera on the strap, just not quite as heavy a one as if you had a DSLR.In short, I could take this camera or leave it. Now that I have it, I'll keep it, use it and enjoy it, with both its kit lens and the old manual-focus lenses I have in my collection. (Note, though, that some of the adapters are expensive, especially those from big name companies.) But I probably wouldn't buy it again. I gave it four stars, because for what it is, it's fine, but my cursor was hovering over the \"3 Star\" rating for a while.Oh, and if you're not into complex functions, and lots of them, plus a maximally boring and obtuse user's manual, think hard before buying the G1. There are way too many functions; fortunately, you can simple set the dial at P, or A, etc. and shoot.UPDATE: I used the camera exclusively for a month, trying to warm to it, but no luck. Finally, on 31 August, I traded it to my wife for her Nikon D40. She likes the live view of the G1, and isn't bothered by its small size. The D40 is no giant, but it's more comfortable for me -- not as user-friendly as the D200, which is once again my main camera. So, in retrospect, I'd have been better off returning the G1, or not buying it in the first place. But, if you're moving up from a point-n-shoot, it still might be OK for you. Just try it on for size first.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great quality portable interchangeable lens camera", "Author": "Photo/Video Gearhead", "ReviewID": "R2C2RWTGYXCIES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I do not feel like carrying my heavy SLR camera and lenses, I take my Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 instead.  With the 14-45mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, the G1 is about one-third the weight of my Sony A900 SLR with a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens.  Of course, the G1's 12 megapixel sensor cannot compete with the A900's 24 megapixel sensor, and the 14-45 lens is neither as fast as, nor of equal quality to, the 24-70 lens, but the portability of the G1 means that I take it with me more often than I take my A900.  The Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 Digital Camera Case Gadget Bag fits the G1 with 14-45 lens perfectly and attaches to my belt via a Velcro strap.  And the Canon WS20 Wrist Strap for all Canon Camcorders is a convenient alternative if you don't want a camera strap around your neck.If I were to list all of the features of the G1 that I like, this review would be rather long, so here is a short list of my favorite features:1. All of the buttons that control focus, metering, ISO, etc. are well positioned and easy to use.2. A real time histogram may be displayed if desired.3. In manual focus mode, the image is magnified in the high resolution electronic viewfinder so that precise focus may be achieved.4. If desired, images may be stored in RAW (RW2) format in addition to the limiting JPEG format.  The RAW alternative allows for better noise suppression (see below).A consequence of the small 14-45 lens is that the lens is not particularly fast and so does not permit low light photography.  However, the Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras remedies this problem.  Also available are the Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0 Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic Digital SLR Cameras and Panasonic 45-200mm f/4.0-5.6 Lumix G Vario MEGA OIS Zoom Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic and Olympus Micro Four Thirds Cameras lenses that extend the zoom range to 14-400mm (35mm equivalent).  And the camera plus all four lenses weigh a mere four pounds, so can easily be taken along on a hike.For those who would like to capture video, the Panasonic DMC-GH1 12MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 1080p HD Video, Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 12.1MP Micro Four-Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-45mm Lens and the somewhat larger Nikon D5000 12.3 MP DX Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens and 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD are attractive alternatives.  But I don't shoot video, so the G1 is a low priced solution to my need for a portable camera.The two weaknesses of the Panasonic G1 are:1. The dynamic range of the sensor is a bit limited, with the consequence that it is fairly easy to blow out the highlights in an image.  I haven't found a good solution to this problem, other than to shoot in RAW mode and underexpose at bit when I want to capture cloud detail.2. The sensor introduces a fair amount of noise above ISO 800.  However, this problem is nicely remedied if one shoots in RAW mode and uses Adobe Lightroom 3 to suppress noise.  This approach easily extends the useful ISO from 800 to 1600, and in some cases to 3200.Update: Panasonic has recently introduced the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G2 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-Inch Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Lumix G VARIO f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens (Black) and Panasonic Lumix DMC-G10 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 14-42mm Lumix G Vario f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens cameras.  Both of these cameras can record video.Also, it appears that the Sony Alpha NEX-3 and NEX-5 cameras, with their APS-C sensors, provide better image quality than any of the Panasonic cameras.  However, as of this writing, the Sony system does not provide as broad a zoom range as does the Panasonic system.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "A near perfect mix of portability and image quality", "Author": "Draper Kauffman", "ReviewID": "RSHT3DD66SMIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my G1 for three months, and there isn't much I can add to the other 5-star reviews.  It's a very solid camera that is easy to carry and easy to use.  It takes great pictures.  It has three excellent kit lenses to choose from, and it can use hundreds of great lenses from the days of film that are now very inexpensive and easily available.I have both kit zooms and 3 legacy primes.  I'm particularly impressed by the performance of the zooms, which are both exceptionally good for such moderately priced lenses.All in all, I highly recommend this camera (or its sibling, the GH1, if you need video) to anyone who is moving up from a fixed lens camera and to anyone who is tired of lugging the weight of a full frame dSLR around.One note:  I've noticed that several reviewers cited poor high-ISO performance as a drawback.  While literally true - a less than full frame sensor is at a technical disadvantage with respect to noise - I've found that this is much less of a problem than I expected.  Part of the reason is that Panasonic took a deliberately conservative approach to setting ISO levels, unlike Canon, Olympus, and others who have exaggerated their ISO numbers.  For this reason, a G1 image shot at what Panny calls \"ISO 800\" is essentially identical in exposure to what many dSLRs produce when set at what those other companies call \"ISO 1600.\"  The amount of light hitting the sensor is the same in both cases, and therefore the amount of noise is quite similar.Thus it is important to compare the noise in an ISO 800 shot from the G1 with the noise from most other popular cameras set at 1600, and so on at every other ISO increment.  (Certain Nikons are an exception, as they are closer to the Panasonic definitions of ISO than the inflated Canon/Olympus definition.)After all, it's the actual exposure settings that matter, not the labels the camera makers put on the ISO.  If two cameras shoot the same scene with the same aperture and the same shutter speed, the two exposures will be the same.  It doesn't matter that one camera is set at ISO 200 and the other is set at ISO 400, the amount of light reaching both sensors is the same.What this means in practical terms is that the G-1's TRUE low light performance is one full stop better than most people expect if they just go by the ISO settings.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "L.

The lens is sharp and much smaller than any DSLR lens. Lots of manual function for professional and for casual shooter you have one of the best auto function in SLR camera atm. Flash is way way beter than any point and shoot and as almost powerful as my D200 build-in. I got it at a slightly cheaper than amazon however. If you mount it to a tripod and took some night still image and you'll will be amaze with the sharpness and quality (I prefer manual configure for this). Shoot Raw and you get even better quality with the ability to edit the original shot in the included software (shooting raw is like having the ability to retake the shot without actually taken it again: readjust ISO, exposure, color, noise, etc...).Cons: Very expensive for an entry camera but this camera has much more function than most DSLR on the market. Lot of manual function can sometime lead to confusion but that's what the Ai function is for. I bought an extra battery and a Sandisk 8gb Extreme III to go with this camera and those are quiet expensive nonetheless. Not recommended for really fast action photographer or indoors action photographer. Noise visible in action shot with ISO 400+. Macro shot can not be taken close enough but extra filter will add close up and that too cost extra $. Expensive proprietary battery instead of standard. No vid ability and if you want that the new model GH1 will cost you an arm. I hope Panasonic release their raw data to Adobe because I wanted to use Lightroom/bridge for editing raw instead of the included software which isn't bad nor good.Overall, I really like this camera despite the cons. It will be perfect if this is in the $400-$500 range but the build quality is pretty high (all made in Japan).

Not good, not fair, but great image quality indoors as well as outdoors.2. Relatively compact size. I was looking very seriously at the Canon PowerShot SX1IS, and the PowerShot G103. Ease of use. I don't have time to fiddle with settings and take six exposures of the same scene to get a good shot.4. Speed. My kids can't hold still, its like an invisible gnome is following them around with a cattle prod.5. Price. I can't afford the moon. I needed to keep this purchase well under $1000.I have had the Lumix G1 for about a month now, and I LOVE it. It fits all 5 of my requirements nicely.1. The G1 takes great pictures. I have tried it outdoors and indoors, I am very happy with the results.2. I was a little worried about its size at first, but in comparison with a full size SLR, the G1 is tiny.3. I can hand this camera to my wife, leave the camera on iauto and she is fine using it.4. I can actually focus on my kids now. I take this camera to the park all the time and get great shots.5. The street price is about $650 for this camera. Well within my budget.Particular features I like:1. Grip. This camera is easy to hold for me and my giant hands. Its small for an SLR, but not so small that I might accidentally swallow it or something either. Its very easy to carry around. It also has a rubbery coating on the body which gives it a nice sheen, as well as added grip.2. The swing-out LCD viewfinder. Makes taking shots from low angles really easy. I also like that the camera knows when I am looking through the eye piece and turns the LCD off.3. The intelligent auto feature detects when a face is present, or when a subject is moving and adjusts settings for you--fast.4. The interface is easy to get around in. I can actually switch settings on this camera without a degree in engineering.5. My wife isn't put off by it. She feels very comfortable picking it up and taking pictures with it.In the end, this camera takes great shots. It is easy to learn, and very easy to carry around.

Chandrasekar", "ReviewID": "R3QZC8IGDI2BEI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For those who don't know, the Panasonic G1 is the first (of hopefully many) camera that adheres to the new micro 4/3 format.  What is so exciting about it?  All SLR cameras use mirrors, prisms, and optical viewfinders so that the photographer can see what his/her subject \"through the lens.\"  SLRs have remained the defacto standard for most serious photographers because most find the whole viewfinder concept so appealing.  The micro 4/3 does away with the mirrors and prisms, and replaces the optical viewfinder of SLRs with an electronic viewfinder.  This allows the cameras that adhere to the standard to be much smaller (and wideangle lenses designed for this mount to be smaller as well).  Onto the real review...The EVF on the G1 is the first that I've seen that is remotely usable.  While not as good as the OVF in my 5D, it is considerably better than the OVF in my older 350D.  The first look through the EVF will impress anyone who hasn't used a Full-Frame camera before.  While there is a noticeable lag (particularly when moving the camera around...a delay of a 10th of a second maybe), the fact that you can see a live histogram in the VF makes the lag completely worthwhile.  Even better, the VF can increase the gain of the screen in darker conditions so you can actually see what you are shooting (it does get grainy, but it is better than seeing nothing at all).  Finally, when you engage Manual Focus, the view in the EVF zooms in on your subject automatically which allows for perfect manual focus adjustments every time!!  Without a doubt, this is the best interchangeable lens camera on the market if you are interested in manually focusing.The articulating LCD is another design choice that is spot-on!!  Why haven't other manufacturers caught on that \"live view\" is completely useless without an articulating LCD?  Switching from the LCD to the EVF is as simple as putting your eye next to the viewfinder.  There is a sensor there that detects when it is being used.  The LCD doesn't have the super resolution of the new 5DMkII or the D700, but it has twice the resolution of my older 5D.So is the camera pocketable?  Not a chance.  However, it isn't much bigger than the larger (with its kit lens) than modern superzoom Point&Shoot; cameras.  I bought it because I found that I was leaving my 5D (with 24-70 f/2.8) at home more often than not because i didn't want to carry so much weight.  The G1, in comparison, is a joy to hold and carry.  For me, the size is just right.  Any smaller and the controls would be unusably small.  Any larger and the camera would begin to resemble smaller DSLRs.  Side Note:  The kit lens has to be seen to be believed...it is SO small.  Even the 45-200 lens (90-400) isn't much bigger than kit lenses for APS-C or FF cameras (let alone comparing it to the monstrous 100-400 lens that canon makes).Noise is reasonable.  I wouldn't go past ISO1250 for prints with the G1.  ISO1600 and 3200 are more than useable for web viewing (which is how a majority of my pics are displayed).  I never really understood how printable ISO6400 prints are suddenly required for every camera...how many people actually print a large number of images anyways?  Downsized to Facebook or Picasaweb sizes, I would imagine that a ISO6400 G1 image would be more than adequate.What I don't like is the lack of any large aperture lenses for the format.  You can buy adapters to use standard 4/3 lenses but the older 4/3 lenses are likely larger than their future micro43 counterparts (and AF doesn't work with many of them).  Adapters also exist for Leica M mount (I'm trying to convince my fiance that leica lenses are a better investment than the stock market right now...but I don't think that she is buying it).  The depth of field for micro43 is already larger due to the smaller sensor so it will be hard to get subject isolation in photographs until large aperture prime lenses become available.I'm really excited about the future of this format.  Panasonic has promised a G1HD someone in the first half of this year (a G1 with video capabilities).  In addition, 3 new lenses have been announced:  a 7/14 f/4, a 14-140, and best of all a 20 mm f/1.7 pancake!  Olympus also showed off a concept of a micro43 camera that looked no bigger than a small point&shoot.;  The future is exciting!", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Lee O.", "ReviewID": "R1KHMZDETW579N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normally use a DSLR, but wanted a smaller camera for portability.

If you are coming from a point and shoot, no worries. This camera is a huge upgrade from any point and shoot camera.Most complaints about this camera revolve around the electronic view finder (EVF). When the ambient light is low, the EVF increases gain so you can see. This causes the display to be very grainy. Relax, when you click the shutter the image will look fine.

While the Sony was excellant for my purposes (photographing yacht races from the water and accompanying me on 4-5 weeks of overseas cruising each year), the outfit was just too heavy for walking around cities.  More and more, I found myself leaving the Sony outfit in the cabin of cruise ships and making do with a Canon 780 IIS pocket camera that's ideal in terms of portability but lacking in its ability to produce tack-sharp 8x10 to 11x41 prints which is about all that I make, and its ability to be used on bright sunny days on the water when even the brightest LCD screen washes out.Enter the Lumix G1.  The 8x10's I'm printing are as sharp as the ones produced with the Sony, the electronic viewfinder (the first decent one I've ever used) is better than the Sony viewfinder, and the Lumix with its terrific 14-45 \"walking around\" kit lens is about half the weight of the Sony with any of its zooms.  In fact, the only things I miss on the Sony are the small 1.4 50mm lens for evening and inside work, and a decently priced full-range zoom like the Sony 18-270mm that goes from the 35mm equivilent of 28-375mm with the twist of a wrist.  For yacht racing photography, that's a virtual necessity since there's no time to switch lenses or grab another body when a 50' racing yacht is bearing down on you at top speed.So ... if Panasonic & Amazon get their act together and reduce the price of the 14-140mm zoon to about $500-$600 (what equivilent Sony and Tamron lenses cost), and if Panasonic brings out their already announced f1.7 20 mm lens any time soon at about $300 (what Olympus and Sony charge for equivilent lenses), I'll happily more than double my investment in this system since it will be ideally suited to my needs, as well as many other pro's, semi-professionals and advanced amateurs.  If this happens, I may sell the sharp and easy-to-use Lumix 45-200mm lens since the 14-140 mm will make it redundant, but I will keep the Lumix 14-45 mm kit lens since it is spectacularly sharp and produces wonderful vibrant colors that few lenses of any manufacturer or price can match.In short, this is a wonderful camera for travelors and on-the-water photographers already (in my opinion) exceeds the capabilities of ANY Sony, Nikon or Canon DSLR for these purposes, and only needs a few more competitively-priced lenses to meet its full potential.  You won't be sorry buying one even at a higher price than I paid.", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Like getting a free camera body", "Author": "bikertrashice \"Ice\"", "ReviewID": "R1JM561V3KFGML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already owned the GF1 (a great camera) with the pancake lens (zoom with your feet).  I wanted the the Panasonic 14-45 lens to add versatility to my GF1.  Through research I found that the newer version of the 14-45 lens is not as good as the one that came with the G1 (and is superior to the lens shipped with the G2).  So for only $100 more than buying the lens I got the superior version plus another battery plus another battery charger plus more cables and PLUS a G1 camera body.  Thank you Amazon, Thank you Panasonic and thank you people who must have the latest and greatest and so drive down prices on the incredible G1.  As much as I like the GF1 I find the G1 even better.  Bottom line - the G1 deal is fantastic - the G1 camera is fantastic - the 14-45 lens that comes with the G1 is fantastic (for the money).  I search out Panasonic products because I find their quality is very good and that is true with both the GF1 and the G1 as well as the lens that come with the cameras.

A mini-DSLR-like camera for $70 less than the price I paid for my LX3 compact a little over a year ago.  But while I like the camera a lot, there are a few things I don't like about it.The fully articulating LCD screen is fantastic.  I simply cannot go back to a camera without one, and will probably buy the Canon 60D if I ever decide to get a DSLR.G1 Pros:Good build quality overallArticulating ScreenNice electronic view finderGreat manual focusing function (manual focus assist allows you to easily choose the point of focus and magnify it by 10x so it is easy to get focus spot-on)compact sizeSharp kit lens (14-45)interchangeble lensesG1 cons:The histogram does not function in manual mode...this is really a pain at times.  How this was allowed on the final G1 product is beyond me; it may be a small camera, but it still was designed to appeal to serious photographers...and manual mode with no active histogram, what the hell? (the histogram does however function in review mode, and it functions fully in Aperture priority and shutter priority)Auto bracketing is poorly implemented, at least for HDR.  You have choices of 3 or 5 shots too tightly spaced, or you can choose 7 shots that only range from -2 to +2.  So you either don't get the full dynamic range that you need, or you get 7 shots which eats up memory and wastes time...and it still might not give you the full range that you need.  For general shooting, it might be fine, but for HDR it is very inefficient.High isos not too good.  I think iso 800 is as high as you would want to go.The rubber around the evf tears out easily and is difficult to put back into place.No video...this really isn't a big deal for me, but it would be nice to have video capability for the rare occasion that I might want it.  (the G2 has video, but the lens is apparently not quite as good quality as the lens that comes with the G1)Photos appear brighter on the LCD than they do when transferred to the computer (dialing down the color and brightness of the LCD helped with this)Summary:I like the size of the G1 and I love the fully articulating screen.  For me it strikes a good balance between DSLR performance and compact size.  I usually carry my cameras in a bag anyway, and the G1 fits easily into many small bags...even with an extra lens and accessories, it is not much of a burden.UPDATE: 2-25-2011  The G1 is really growing on me and it just feels right to me now.  No, it is not the smallest, no it doesn't have THE best image quality, and it can be challenging in low light, but it strikes a really nice balance for me.  I only want, and can only afford one camera right now, and the G1 really hits the sweet spot.

The swiveling LCD is a tremendous feature: it makes it possible to shoot from all kinds of angles. The electronic viewfinder is great for shooting in bright sunlight. Another strength of the G1 is its battery, which is giving me at least 600 shots between charges.If you're going to shoot RAW, I recommend getting a 16 GB SDHC memory card. My 8 GB card fills up in under 400 RAW shots.I upgraded to the G1 because I expected better quality images. I'm not disappointed. The G1's images are noticably better than the LX3's. The difference is particularly noticable when photos are printed.My only criticisms of the G1 are that the lens is not as fast or as wide as I'd like. It is max. 3.5 f stop, and min. 28 mm.

That is why I bought this camera rather then the G2. This lens will increase in value and desirablity moving forward.Some people like the newer lens but its build and characteristics do not stand up to the this earlier version.Panasonic cut costs on the newer lens to save money .So if you dont need the video get the G1 at a reduced price and if you really want video then get the GF1 which has true video quality.  Panasonic manuals are terrible so be prepared to learn on your own or check out the blogs the camera is worth the effort. he G1 works well with adapters for many great Legacy lenses I have about 6 Hexanon (Konica) Lenses. The Macro works great just dont use the m2 adapter with it. Also when using Legacy lenses you need to double the legnth. So a 50mm becmes a 100 mm unless it is a MACRO.You also have to manually focus but using a great sharp lens like a Hexanon 57mm f1.2 gets you some big benefits especially in lower light situations.

I took both cameras on a 10-day trip to Alaska (motto - Always have a Plan B) that included time on a catamaran glacier tour, in Denali National Park, and being ferried by fishing boat from Kodiak to Spruce Island and back. I used it indoors with and w/o flash as well as outdoors in mainly cloudy and often misty conditions, shooting in aperture mode, \"basic film\" setting, and came home with over 400 really nice shots, some of which I have exhibited locally.Tips:  I turned on Intelligent ISO and set the limit at 800; beyond that, images have noticeable noise. As with the fz28, I got better color and contrast by underexposing 1/3 stop. I turned off features I did not need, used aperture mode (manual and shutter speed modes would work just as well) and used the viewfinder. More recently I turned back on the manual focus assist to compensate for situations in which autofocus cannot recognize my intended subject. I turned off the focus assist lamp as well, and have not missed it. Do not use noise reduction to push for a higher ISO; it will soften the images. Leave it set on s-rgb for best color.Pros: small size fits well in my hands, is light enough to take anywhere, but feels solid and has enough weight to hold steady. Optical image stabilization works beautifully, can hand hold, with the kit lens zoomed out, at 1/40 second if I steady the camera with my elbows or on my shoulder. The camera powers up and is ready quickly; I am getting shots I'd have missed previously. Electronic viewfinder is large for such a small camera, and bright. The kit lens has a good range and produces tack-sharp Raw images (that from a habitual pixel-peeper). The 45-200mm lens and the 100-300mm lenses also give great results with the G1. Jpeg images are also quite nice. Has a hot-shoe for external flash, should you want one. Really nice screen that rotates out for reviewing and swivels for those shots that you can't get at eye-level. Really good bang for the buck.Neutral:  Like all modern cameras, the G1 is loaded with bells and whistles. Frankly, I wouldn't spend this much money to do point and shoot; it just isn't necessary.Cons: really limited useful ISO range. I have pre-ordered a G3 body after reading dp's initial information and viewing their comparison shots at ISO 3200. It will be my indoor kit. EVF is noisy in dim light.

Ultimately I went with this because of:- price: I got refurbished, so it was significantly less costly- style: I really like the red body- size: It's great how much lighter it is than standard DSLRs.The main reason I wanted the Nikon was it says it performs better in low light, and I can believe it.

The switcher dial in front is just rightly placed.  The articulated LCD is great--you can keep it closed most of the time to protect it, save battery, and just use the viewfinder, but if you want to review/show others or take a weird angle, it helps a lot.I particularly like taking outdoors, macro, and architecture.

Having decided to begin doing wedding photography and having found the G1 kit and the 45-200 zoom on sale, I decided to purchase them for that purpose. In my experience the Panasonics produce very flattering portraits, but can also be adjusted for increased contrast.I took the G1 with me to Alaska this month to put it to the test. I shot in aperture mode exclusively using the \"standard film\" setting and exposure auto-bracketing. My ISO settings varied between 100 and 400.All of the shots of my traveling companions look great. Alaska summers are mostly cloudy, resulting in dull pictures before editing; however, the photos cleaned up nicely with minimal editing. The photos show no evidence of digital noise and far less clipping of highlights than my FZ28.Pros: The camera powers up very quickly and the lenses zoom quicly and smoothly. With the kit lens I was able to hand hold shots at shutter speed 1/10\" and at 1/40\" with the 45-200 even on the water (traveling at slow speeds). The OIS system more than compensates for the somewhat slow lenses. The camera was easy on the battery; I purchased one spare, which was enough, but I also used the viewfinder rather than the LCD and turned off the features I don't use. The G1 is light and small but feels nice in the hand. It is good in low light; I used the flash less than ten times. I changed the lenses over and over with no sign of dust on the sensor. The camera is equipped to accomodate a hot-shoe flash. I was able to turn off the auto-focus assist lamp and didn't miss it.Cons: The electronic viewfinder shows noise when being used near other electronic equipment and in low light, which is not a problem with my FZ 20 or 28. The built-in flash is minimally useful, but then it's rarely needed.Before digital photography I spent 20 years shooting with an Olympus OM10 and have sorely missed it after weating it and the lenses out.

While looking at some later models, I ran across a good deal on a G1 and, after investigating further, found it had a lot of appeal.  The excellent EVF, great kit lens, and overall image quality sold me.  After some quick, initial tests, I am very pleased with it.  Here are some first impressions.I purchased this open box G1 here on Amazon Deals.  I've had mixed luck with Amazon Deals, but this one is a winner.  The G1 is one nice camera.  The size is nearly perfect for me, not too small, still can grip well and hold steady, but small enough to be more portable and, most importantly, light enough that when combined with several lenses and other gear it's not too much to grab and go.  I can also use a light weight tripod since the camera is so light even with a long zoom (the 45-200mm Panasonic) attached.  This is really convenient and means I'm much more likely to have what I need in any specific situation.My initial tests were very satisfactory.  Very sharp, very nice images right off the bat.  I realized immediately that the percentage of good images with this camera is higher than usual.  The Intelligent Exposure and IA full auto mode work extremely well.  The best I've ever used, personally.  I tried lots of different shots in difficult lighting situations and the IA did a very commendable job of always getting a usable shot and often a great one.  Very important for \"capturing the moment\" type shooting when you don't have time to plan your shot.I've got the Panasonic 45-200mm zoom and 20mm f1.7 pancake in addition to the 14-45mm lens included and I think this is a dream setup that pretty much covers it for me.  And at a very reasonable cost.  Anyone on a budget should take a good look at this setup, in my opinion.  (You might prefer a different body, of course, but the G1 works for me.)In shooting with the 14-45mm right out of the box, I was impressed with the image quality, the sharpness, color, and overall results were very good.  Excellent, in fact.  I found this a pretty impressive camera from the get-go.  I find the controls easy to use and easy to understand.  The menus seem pretty well laid out to me.  You have enough dedicated controls to handle all the important things.  And the overall feel and handling are nice -- which is extremely important to me.  I can't use a camera very long if it doesn't \"fit\" me.  I'm very comfortable with this.I found the lens-based OIS stabilization to work very well.  Guessing at least a 3-stop advantage.  This is very important because it means I can hand-hold a lot of shots instead of using a  tripod.  I shoot a lot at night and late in the day, so this is a big plus for me.I am very impressed with the iA full auto mode.  I generally don't use full auto much, but I can see that changing with this camera, it is truly good enough to rely on much of the time for quick shots.  If you want to pull out your camera and take a quick shot, that's a nice plus.  I liked also that I have all the shot info nicely displayed in the excellent EVF so I can 'overrule\" the auto settings if I chose (but I rarely needed to).  Of course, in situations where I have the time, I'll more likely shoot manually or in one of the PASM modes.Speaking of which, the manual focus works very well.  I was a little concerned about the EVF, but I am happy to report that it is excellent and works great.  I was able to focus very easily and the results were accurate.  I also found the EVF and LCD display accurate in giving a good indication of what the shot really captured vs. some cameras (especially P&S;) which the displays are completely unreliable in that respect.I really, really like the tracking AF -- that's a superb feature that I'd love to have on some of my other cameras.  Kudos Panasonic!  It works well.  In general, everything on this camera seems to work well, so far.  I was able to pick it up and start shooting very quickly and easily, though I do plan to study the manual carefully as I always do with a new camera.  It's a good test of the overall design to see how far one can get before doing so.  And on that score, the G1 does remarkably well.By the way, the excellent 14-45mm kit lens, the higher resolution EVF (worth 100 bucks in itself), and the overall excellent results (image quality) are what attracted me to the G1.  Another appealing fact to me, as a bit of a gear collector, is that it is a historic camera in being the first really new style/design to come along in quite some time and so will, I think, have some collectable appeal down the road.  But it's the great images that matter the most.As you can see, I very much like the G1.

F-stop and shutter speed easily controlled by the scroll wheel in front, very well positioned.I looked at several full sized DSLRs and in every case, the viewfinder was either tiny or dim compared to that 1960s vintage Minolta.  The 'viewfinder' on the G1 is a video display, probably borrowed from a Panasonic video camera.  It is bright, it can be configured to show different sets of information and it lets me keep my eye to the viewfinder while I compose and shoot.The kit lens is pretty darned good; the whole kit costs what a decent DSLR system lens would.  Zoom is fully manual (which I prefer) and has a real focusing ring (although it is thin compared to the lenses I'm used to).  The camera allows fully manual focusing, continuous focusing or 'focus on half press'.  The selection switch is on the top left; easy to find and use without taking my eye away from the viewfinder.  One interesting thing about focusing: there is a configurable mode that digitally zooms in while you focus, so you get a very magnified view to hone the focus with.  That's good, but not really the same as my split ring/dazzle prism focus on the 35mm.There is virtually no delay when turning the camera on; it's ready to shoot immediately.  The built-in flash is so-so.  Adequate for indoor work but any serious work will use either the hot shoe or an off-camera flash.  That there's a built-in flash at all is a good thing.  I didn't have one on my 35...  Which brings up low-light work.  This isn't the camera for that.  The kit lens isn't fast enough to do night time photography without a tripod, and even then you'll be using the built-in auto-bracket function to get the shot.  The camera's brain misjudges dim scene exposure values.  I tried it on some astrophotography and it was OK but not the same as putting an f1.4 25mm lens on the Minolta.Finally, it's a compact enough camera that it's always in my backpack.  It's light and although I wouldn't take it scuba diving with me, it hasn't had a problem with fog, snow or drizzle.As a fully manual 35mm camera user I found I had no trouble at all adapting to this camera.  It has been a lot of fun to be able to experiment and not worry about how many exposures were left before I have to change rolls of film.

I discovered a lot of barrel distortion and I often had problems in bright light.This camera performed well with ample ambient light. Like the rest of the Lumix family, I found it performed poorly in low light without some sort of tripod or anchor.All things considered, it's a good camera hindered by a less-than-stellar lens, which could pose an issue due to the fact that the body only adheres to other micro-four-thirds lenses. I don't think that should stop the average recreational photographer from buying it; it's a fantastic deal and really is a good camera.

I have been very happy with it especially when I use Raw and manual mode.  A very nice feature is you get raw images even when you switch to an auto type mode.  It takes getting use to the settings and the menu though.  Take the time to read the manual and play around with it before using it for a more serious shoot.  Auto sometimes gave me a shallow depth of field such as f3.5, when I would have expected and preferred f8.  The only reason I gave features a 4 star is because there is a wheel to change my aperature and shutter right above the finger hold for my right hand.  Sometimes my finger slips up pushing in the wheel and that changes the aperature to shutter and vice versa.  So I have changed my aperature by mistake and didn't notice until I was home looking at photos on my monitor.  I believe they have put that wheel else where on the newer models.  I love the large viewfinder and I do have to get use to the electrical viewfinder.  It can be quit grainy when it is dark out.  But overall, I love the camera.  I bought it because of its style (and picture quality), and I'm able to hold it comfortably.  I have hands that are on the large side so I'm always hitting buttons by accident on my smaller cameras.  I would have bought the newer model because of its neat features, but they made it a little smaller and the handhold is not as pronounced.  So I decided on this model.  I'm not particularly interested  in video so I don't really need that new feature either.  You really need to decide what you will use this camera for; I like it most of the time.

Also helps when taking low down macro shots or when holding the camera up high over a crowd.The picture quality is terrific. The \"iA\" or Intelligent Automatic mode is great when you do not feel like adjusting settings or when you pass the camera to a lesser techno-savvy friend. I am not a good photographer at all but this thing seems to make most of my shots look I must know what I am doing. To be honest I have been getting great compliments on my pictures, however, I am not doing anything different than when I used my old crappy camera. If upgrading from a point and shoot this camera will make you want to study how to improve your skills. I found myself many a night up late on [...] learning new tips and tricks.This camera comes with some pretty good software also. \"PhotoFunStudio\" to import and manage and \"Silky-pix\" to optimize and develop your RAW images.

They are close together and easily pressed unintentionally. This may not be a problem over time. The viewfinder and LCD are clear and good quality. The tilting/rotating LCD is very useful. It's capable of shooting RAW. I'm using it with Mac OS 10.5 Leopard. Panasonic has a plugin that allows the G1, the RAW files, Leopard, and iPhoto 09 to work together. I don't recommend the camera, however, unless you are willing to spend time learning to use it. The settings are complex. That means there are a lot of options, but figuring out how to use them and set them is a challenge. Be prepared to study the manual and/or online tutorials. It isn't very difficult to learn the programmed settings, but it's still more complex than a point and shoot (with far superior results).

Paci \"Shutterbug\"", "ReviewID": "R2QJWLECJ04DY2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a fairly serious amateur photographer who has in recent years mostly used some of the better digital compacts selling in the $500-600 range. I purchased the Lumix G1 and both lenses because I wanted to step up in quality and needed a smaller, lighter alternative to a full DSLR kit for travel and wildlife photography.  After working with the camera and lenses for several weeks, I have come to the conclusion that, while I will be keeping it, the camera with its two Panasonic lenses represents a compromise in terms of image quality and is not as much of an upgrade over the better digital compacts as I had hoped. I have not looked into using the camera with some of the other lenses that can be made to work with it using various adapters.Regarding the 45-200 zoom lens in particular: at full zoom, the images are soft. There is also some flaring and chromatic aberrations that I don't know enough about to explain, except to know that they are there. I have a quality multi-coated UV filter on the lens and am also using the lenshood.I understand Panasonic has issued some firmware updates for the camera and both lenses which improve lens performance, but the instructions for loading these into the camera look pretty complicated.  I have yet to determine whether the soft focus is due to problems with the lens or the autofocus itself (the manual focus on these lenses seems difficult to use), with my use of the autofocus, with my choice of settings (the camera offers many options which I have not yet fully explored), whether the image stabilization is not giving me as much extra leeway on the shutter speed as I hoped, or whether this is just a problem inherent with most inexpensive zoom lenses. That said, many of the images do sharpen up somewhat in Photoshop to acceptable levels. But I have yet to see an image shot with the telephoto lens zoomed out to 400mm that is truly tack sharp -- even if the shutter speed is over 1,000 of a second. That is a little scary.If I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would. I am giving it 4 because I assume that most users will not be using the lens as I am -- usually zoomed all the way out, with aperture open all the way, and relying on the image stabilization to photograph birds in available light. I realize I am pushing it to its limit on almost every shot. Still, I hoped to be blown away and I am not.UPDATE: Realized in talking so much about the telephoto lens and its shortcomings, I did not really talk much about the camera. Panasonic did get a number of things right with this camera. Noise reduction is much improved over their past efforts. Even at ISOs up to 800 and beyond, noise is not that noticeable. Even when it starts to kick in, it looks very natural, almost like film grain. A pleasant surprise.Build quality is fairly good with the body and focusing and zoom rings on the lenses having a nice rubberized feel. Controls are intuitive and are well placed. Several things that should be more accessible are buried in the menus, such as the \"guide lines,\" but the \"quick menu\" button on top of the camera gives you quick access to most of the controls you'll need while shooting.LCD screen is big and clear though I use it mostly for playback. It has been a while since I've had a camera with an optical viewfinder (this one is electric) and I find I am mostly using that. This one is extremely bright even in low light, though it can get kind of jerky and grainy.If Panasonic can improve the autofocus issues (and possibly they have already done so with the firmware updates) then the micro four-thirds system (a model with HD video and some new lenses are due out soon) will be a viable option for serious amateurs who want to avoid the weight and size of a full DSLR system.", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good from dawn till dusk", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R1FYFZIF0QERPP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you shoot from dawn till dusk this is a great camera, however I often shoot at night in low light situations, and unless I'm doing something wrong this camera is totally unreliable shooting in low light situations using auto focus.

As I got use to the feel of the camera, as I've only had point-and-shoots up to this point, it started to feel like an extension of my hand.  I wasn't sure I would be able to get used to the manual zoom, and just the added weight of this type of camera, but it was no problem.  It's lighter than most DSLRs I have looked at, but it feels really solid.The lens that it came with is the only lens I have right now, but it's been perfect for taking pictures of my niece and nephew, which is the main reason I wanted a better camera, not to mention I wanted to take my photography hobby to the next level.  I've had a Sony Steady Shot DSC-H5 for a few years, and I've been very happy with it.  During the last year it started to deplete batteries like crazy, which is what made me think about getting a new camera in the first place.  I had figured that when I got around to buying a new camera it would be a DSLR, because that's the new standard, and I wanted to be able to switch lenses, and I wanted my pictures to look more polished and professional.  My father wanted to buy me a camera for Christmas and I told him I wanted a DSLR.  Well, nothing is simple when it comes to electronics and my Dad.  He will spend months reading every review, and looking at every website, or available piece of information, before making a decision.  When he brought up these new Micro-Four-Third cameras, my initial reaction was \"that's nice, but I really want a DSLR.\"  But when he started to explain it more, and forwarded me all the reviews and articles regarding these cameras, I had to agree that it did sound just as good as a DSLR, and perhaps a bit simpler to use.  Well, my Dad was right, as usual.I've been so impressed with this camera.  If you are unsure about buying a camera like this because you have only used point-and-shoots in the past, worry not.  It's got a great auto-mode (IA-Intelligent Auto), which allows you to take good pictures on the fly, while learning about shutter speed, ISO, white balance, etc. at your own pace.  The pictures I've taken with this camera have been spectacular.  I've also been very impressed, and pleasantly surprised, at the battery life.  I bought a fairly cheap extra battery on eBay, so I would be sure to have an extra.  I took at least 6 or 7 hundred pictures on my first charge.  I was amazed.  And the battery charges fairly quickly as well, if you don't want to invest in another battery right away.  I was wary about buying a camera that didn't take normal batteries, but the increase in performance is obvious and well worth it.Basically, I have been extremely happy and impressed with this camera.  Honestly, I don't see why anyone would want a DSLR when this type of camera is an option.  We actually bought a used (open-box would be more accurate I think) one from Amazon for $399, yet it came in the original box, with all the paperwork and accessories, and it looks as if it has never been touched.  I buy all my major electronic purchases from Amazon, new and refurbished, and have never been disappointed, or found the item cheaper somewhere else.  And the only one they had at that price was the blue body, which I wasn't sure I liked, but would be a really stupid reason to pass up such a good deal, but I've actually gotten a lot of compliments on it, and the color has definitely grown on me.This is the perfect camera for an amateur photographer that wants to take their hobby to the next level.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic G1", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R1D6UOAKWIRDC0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a professional photographer.I have as a giftsince my wife was tired of get any nice pictures from herold camera, she decide to give to me Panasonic G1,I 'm glad she did.

It  has no kind of sealing, so it's open to any kind of moisture, dust and sand. The image sensor itself is open exposed when changing lens(read DPreview). Once affected you send it to Panasonic Service Center to fix and after months they will tell you its better trash it than fix it. As they did to me when I sent them my Lumix DMC FZ50. So, buy something else, like Cannon, Nikon or, like I did, a Pentax K20D, same price but a real SLR with all kinds of protection against moisture and dust.", "Date": "April 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "not for an amateur", "Author": "R.

It has literally hundreds of settings that only an expert would understand and only someone with a 'photographic memory' will learn. The User Guide is not user-friendly. Panasonic should contract with a good training company to create a User Guide. If I had bought the G1 from our local dealer, I would have returned it. This our third digital camera. The first two were 'point and shoot' (Kodak and Canon) and took beautiful images, but were too slow. We were attracted to the G1 by reviewers who said the first-frame rate was very fast, but we find it not to be so. We'll continue to use our PowerShot A80.", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "first excited, now disappointed..", "Author": "Guy Tower", "ReviewID": "RQQKS97CITK9I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was thrilled to buy this camera. it has unbeatable features like minimum weight, easy menu, super user friendly controls and an overall terrific feeling to it. I am disappointed with the fact that when I use a 3:2 aspect ratio, the camera degrades from 12 megapixels to 10; that's false advertising to say that it is a 12 megapixel camera, when most settings lower this number by over 20%. Another issue that bothered me is that noise is very visible when at 800 asa or more. Pictures taken in a low light setup are not at all usable, i am aware that some reviews say otherwise, but it's not my experience. Also when the user must upgrade to a higher software version (i.e. 1.1 to 1.2), it's really a very complicated process and it resets the camera, and forces you to set up again from scratch! Finally, i am forced to buy the camera with its lens, when i wanted to buy the body only. For these reasons, the camera's high price is excessive and it novelty wears out quite fast.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.00", "Features": "12.1-megapixel 4/3-type MOS sensor; world's first Micro Four Thirds camera\nIncludes Lumix G Vario 14 - 45 mm F3.5 - F5.6 ASPH.Mega OIS lens\nLive View Finder and bright 460,000-dot resolution, 3.0-inch LCD\nNew Contrast AF (Auto Focus) function; Face Detection and Intelligent Auto (iA) mode\nCapture images to SD/SDHC/Multimedia cards (not included)", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 12.1MP Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with Lumix G Vario 14-45 mm f/3.5-5.6 ASPH Mega OIS Lens (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nfCsET%2B1L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001FSKDWG"}}
