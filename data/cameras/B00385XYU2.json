If you have bought it, do whatever you can to return it. Here's why:1- The CAMERA:-During my second time using it under water (shallow depth), water crept in after half an hour. I got multiple error messages and then it just died. I had NEVER dropped it, even though you are technically allowed to. Honestly, when compared to a Canon of similar price range (that my friend bought for the trip), the photo quality was inferior as was the LCD screen. Sony's only superior feature was the underwater advantage, which FAILED with disappointing colors.  (Canon has a comparable feature for panoramic shots, not as cool but just as functional).2- The SERVICE:-When I contacted customer service about the warranty coverage, they required that I send the camera to the Laredo Repair Center in Texas. This was quite inconvenient, especially b/c I had bought the camera for a 1 year trip abroad and was in Asia at the time. They gave me all the information I needed to include. They told me I did not need a reference number during our online chat. I called customer service just to verify, and they confirmed. So I sent the camera back. I had not heard anything for nearly 6 weeks, when I finally called again and was told that I had to deal directly w/ Laredo b/c Sony had no record. Besides placing me on hold for thirty+ minutes and then hanging up on me on THREE different occasions, each time I called Laredo I got a different story. 1) \"the camera was never delivered.\" 2)(After I sent them the delivery confirmation), \"the camera was delivered, but we can't fix it so we are either sending you a new one or a refurbished one. we'll call you back in five minutes.\" 3) (when they never called back), \"this was human error and we won't be replacing it\" (more nonsense that I don't have the energy to type ensued, including him mixing up my file with two other people) \"um, a supervisor will call you back by the end of the day\" (never received call back).JUST BUY A CANON. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. SONY- I HOPE YOU READ THIS AND 1) CONTACT ME TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE 2) CANCEL YOUR MANAGEMENT CONTRACT WITH THE LAREDO REPAIR CENTER (I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT YOU WOULDN'T ALLOW THIS LEVEL OF INCOMPETENCY WITHIN YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION).", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great underwater performance", "Author": "L. Chua \"supermom\"", "ReviewID": "RRUYE8DRVVRFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the TX 5 for 2 reasons: 1) picture and video quality 2) underwater performance1) Picture qualityThe TX5 one great camera that is tiny and beautifully crafted. Picture and video quality are both great. And the extras like \"smile detection\" and panoramic features do not dissapoint.I still use my Casio Exilim and another old Sony Cyber-shot, and picture quality wise Sony's cameras have always been better than Casio's. Casio's low light quality and anti shake capability never worked well, or else I would have bought the Casio G1 from my local Costco and save $100. Instead, I got the TX5 and I am very satisfied. I also love the fact that the TX5 takes standard SD card.2) Underwater performanceThis is the best underwater *compact* camera money can buy IMO. Its underwater performance is just superb - at least for now :) I can't say the same for other compact underwater cameras. Check out reviews of other cameras on Amazon if you don't believe how other cameras leak and die very quickly.A VIDEO is worth a million words, so I'll let my video do the talking.

Though I always select products with high ratings, I'm picky and easily dissatisfied with purchases I make.  The point-n-shoots often performed poorly in dim lighting and tended to produce pictures with too much noise.My Canon DSLR T1i was leader of my pack, capturing stunning shots at warp speed.  However, as anyone who shoots the \"big boys\" knows, these cameras are heavy to pack around and they're sensitive to impact, to dust, and to temperature & humidity. While a DSLR is essential to the professional photographer, a quality point-n-shoot fits the needs of most of us hobby photographers.  Because I do a lot of shooting in the mountains, I decided to purchase a durable camera for those times when weather conditions are less than stellar.FEATURESWasn't sure I'd like the touchscreen, but it's user-friendly and far sturdier than I'd expected.  The touchscreen also gives you bigger \"buttons\" to push, making it easy for those of us with large fingers. The camera features a nice slide-show with music.  The battery compartment door has a metal hinge. How many cameras nowadays have that??  More metal, less plastic on this camera.  I have shot underwater only once with it, which was fun but not something I'm likely to do often.  I've taken it out on many rainy, cold days, however.  I now cannot imagine owning a delicate \"regular\" camera ever again.PROS & CONSThis camera produces some of the finest quality photos of any point-n-shoot I've seen.  Excellent, clear shots both night and day.  The pictures I've taken show no visible noise and have brilliant color saturation.  There is still shutter lag with this camera, which sometimes tests my patience.  I also wish there was greater zoom capability, but that feature is limited on waterproof models. Of course a DSLR has greater versatility and can perform feats that a point-n-shoot cannot.  But this little camera is tougher and is a fraction of the weight.RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIESI bought the Sony slim case that clips onto your belt loop.  Perfection!  Despite the pride I used to feel in shooting my DSLR, I now find myself heading to the mountains a little lighter.  I clip this little camera to my belt and hit the trail.  The round nylon wrist strap that comes with the camera is uncomfortable over the long haul.  I bought the OP/TECH USA Cam Strap and highly recommend this little gem.  This camera has a tricky strap holder (teeny-tiny hole), so I had to feed the new strap connector through with tweezers, but it was worth the hassle.  This sturdy neoprene strap is so soft and comfortable!  Also, the battery life is not impressive.  I bought a backup battery, and recommend this to others if you'll be out shooting for lengthy periods of time.  The soft camera case, soft wrist strap, and backup battery can go a long way toward helping you enjoy a happier day.  :)HOW IT HANDLES SHOCKOn a recent hike in the mountains, I was climbing a rugged rocky area to photograph a waterfall, when I accidentally dropped this camera.  The footing below me was solid rock and the camera fell approximately 4'.  I held my breath as I scampered over the rocks to pick it up.  The metal cover was scratched up, but the camera continued taking shots like nothing happened.  Very impressed with that.  I had been wearing a neck strap, which was swinging as I hiked, banging into my chest and annoying me, so I unhooked the camera from it.  That's when said accident happened.  I'm now using the neoprene wrist strap mentioned above.  (See my review on this product, and on the recommended camera case, if interested.)COMPARISON WITH A SIMILAR CAMERAI also bought the popular PANASONIC LUMIX TS4 12.1 because I was impressed with the tough housing of that camera.  After one weekend of shooting, however, I returned it to Amazon.  Photos did not match the quality of this camera's-- not even close.  On the Panasonic Lumix, indoor pics looked \"stark\" rather than \"soft,\" colors were off by more than a shade, and nighttime shots were dark, somewhat fuzzy, and had \"ghostly\" streaks in them.  I was shooting both cameras side by side for comparison, and there simply WAS NO comparison.  Makes me appreciate my little Sony even more!UPDATE 9/28/13:  This past weekend I visited the Lewis & Clark Caverns in Montana.  During the 2-hour tour in darkness with minimal light, I shot numerous pictures of the caverns, as did virtually everyone else on the trip.  There were many, many comments from friends and fellow tourists about how beautiful the caverns were and how disappointing it was that they could not capture that beauty on their cameras due to the darkness.  My pictures, however, taken on this trusty little Sony Cyber-Shot, came out crisp and rich in color and detail.  People were so wowed that some friends of mine requested copies of MY pictures to take home so they'd have memories of this special experience.  Again, excellent camera, SUPERB pics in low-light conditions. :)", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "DSC-TX5 - One unit to replace your Point-and-shoot and video camera....", "Author": "Camera Noobie.....", "ReviewID": "RIVS5DRNURGGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent all-around camera.

Hughes", "ReviewID": "R38RX9Y349GIDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with the thought of selling my dedicated Panasonic digital camera and dedicated Flip HD video camcorder.  I tested this camera out heavily over the last few days at an indoor ice rink with lots of motion and poor lighting, and at a colorful outdoor festival on a sunny day.The camera is really slim and appears to be waterproof, windproof, and shock resistant.  Feels sturdy-- much of the camera body is metal.  The LCD screen is touch sensitive and there are virtually no buttons you need to press on the camera body (you just slide the cover down, take your pictures, and then slide the cover up).Pros:+ Camera profile is slim and appears very sturdy.+ VERY fast to use.  You can slide the cover down, take a picture, and slide the cover back up in about two or three seconds.  Most cameras won't power up and shut off nearly that fast.+ Excellent picture quality.+ Lots of settings to tweak if you like to make things complicated.  Otherwise there's an \"Easy\" setting which basically just allows you to take great pictures automatically.+ Takes excellent HD video.+ Camera organizes photos nicely in camera by date and makes selection by thumbnail easy.Cons:- Curiously there is a stainless steel sliding cover for the front, but no such cover for the back.  The sliding front cover makes you THINK you could slide this in your pocket and go, but I worry the rear touchscreen will scratch.  Will need a case.  Given that Sony has marketed this camera as so tough, they should have made it possible to carry around WITHOUT a case.- Rear touchscreen is a fingerprint magnet since all menus are accessed from it.- Pan feature is pretty weak.  Sony suggests you can make panoramic photos without a tripod, but the camera will have error messages if you do not pan with a REALLY steady hand.- Zoom strength is limited due to constraints of slim profile.- No optical zoom.  Digital only.Overall Verdict: I'm keeping this camera, and selling my Panasonic digital camera and my Flip HD video camera.  This camera is so slim and easy to use that I think I will be more likely to use it in various situations since it's so portable.

I am inclined to give it 4 stars for that alone but I must mention that the quality of the images are maybe better or as good as I have seen on any \"digital camera\"  . .This looks like an ideal option for someone who's looking to get a camera that is portable and not a digital SLR.Here are some other things I noticed about the camera, firstly, don't get it in this colour, it just looks horrible I feel, get the black one.I wish the \"playback\" (or review images/video) button was placed more conveniently and the plastic wasn't so plastic. This is maybe the only flaw of the camera but for the price one can hardly complain.We clicked images on 5 megapixel intentionally and they came out swell and better than ever. I found that images in the dark look better than the older Sony Cameras but this one is a definite improvement. There is still room for improvement because I was walking through Vegas with this camera but I got nowhere trying to tweak the settings or what have you. There was a time I Had to use the blur/burst feature to get the camera to take still images correctly.The panorama feature is awsome, the videos are good if not great. The battery life is good, more or less the same whether you fling it in the water or not.This is an ideal camera for someone who has a camera older than 24 months and is looking to get something that will last for a couple of years. The water proof feature makes this great. The battery takes a while to charge and if you remove it half way or say after 35-45 minutes it will say battery lose soon. So yeah you have to make sure the battery is fully charged, avoid charging the batteries unless battery is low. The flash is good. I never use the accompanied software.I have a Canon 780 but if I had to change, I would change to this. I'm gonna wait 6 months and see if they release an update and maybe I'll buy that. Buy this is if your digital camera is out-dated.I give full marks to Sony for the beautiful LCD display and the ease-of-use - taking marks away mainly because it's not a night owl and configuring the settings was difficult in a well lit Vegas.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY!!!", "Author": "LP \"LP\"", "ReviewID": "R1DA20R5LIEYTD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "BEWARE!!!I bought this camera six months ago.

I don't expect any pocket camera to have the capability of a DSLR with large lens, but at the same time, I did expect more from this one.I was quite disappointed that there are no real \"program\" settings. You can lower or raise the exposure, but that's about it. I wanted to take a photo of a sunset, and later the night sky with stars and the horizon. This camera couldn't handle it, no matter how hard I tried. All it needs is the ability to program leaving the shutter open for ten seconds, or a decent night-setting.

I did the research and selected the Sony DSC-TX5 for its waterproofness, thinness (fits in my wader's front pouch perfectly), and strong ratings on image and video quality.I have had the camera for over 6 months using it extensively for the above purposes and have been extremely pleased.  I can't overemphasize how the thin profile of this camera makes it so easy to carry that you find yourself taking it more places and using it more than you would with some of the bulkier waterproof cameras currently out there(for example slipping it into a biking jersey pocket).The other reviews can provide the technical detail on this camera but I am writing this review as a testimonial to its durability.  At the risk of appearing as a total bone head with my gear (which I am typically not) I managed to lose the camera on Halloween eve when we went with our kids to a Halloween party.  I remember leaving the party with my phone and camera, which was in a black leather case.  The next morning I couldn't find the camera in the house or our truck.  Making a long story short after searching for it for 2.5 days we found it in the street outside our friend's house where the Halloween party was.  I must have dropped it in the dark while loading the kids up.  It had got mixed into some leaves and sat in the rain all of this time.  Upon opening up the case it appeared that the camera had been ran over at least once because the sliding metal lense cover was slightly tweaked and dented.  Fearing the worse I slid open the cover and was pleased to see the LCD screen fired up.  In fact the only thing wrong with the camera was that the clear coat on the stainless steel sliding lens cover flaked off from soaking in the rain all of that time.  We have since used the camera many times with no ill affects from my idiotic indescretion.So if you want a camera that is water proof, bomb proof, idiot proof!, and takes great photos and video, I can recommend the Sony DSC-TX5.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for the pool!", "Author": "Roy E.

It did really well caoturing action shots such as jumping off a water slide or rope jump. I got photos that I never would have gotten without it. I kept the camera in the pool for hours at a time so that I could always be ready to get a great shot. I worried that this amount of water exposure would damage the camera, but it kept on working without problems. It did need to be recharged frequently however because we were taking so many photos. Only problems were that low light shots were poor and the clear sealant on the sliding cover is peeling off. I also would have liked a flash-on setting because the auto-flash wasn't always reliable. Also we took so many photos that its a huge job to select and edit the best ones.

We have taken it swimming in the ocean and pool, hiking, and it has so far survived my purse.  It is tiny, and I like that it is so much cuter and sleeker than most other waterproof cameras.The picture quality is excellent for a point and shoot of its size, and it has a really cool panoramic feature which lends itself to the \"rugged\" places this camera can go.  It is not an SLR in terms of image quality, but for what we are using it for it takes really great photos.All in all, I am really, really happy with this camera and am glad I spent the extra [...] for the water/shock/freeze proof features.

The picture quality while not DSLR quality is still good enough for you to create nice desktop backgrounds and even photos worth canvasing.

LCD screen should have a \"lock\" function, because sometimes you touch it and change camera functions without wanting to. As a camera to use underwater, it should also have a wrist adjustment. You should always be alert not to letting your camera fall into water.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "WONDERFUL CAMERA", "Author": "carebear", "ReviewID": "R1B3OELQDHHAXH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera.

Love the panorama and macro features.  Only qualifiers:-  Have not yet taken it into the water to ocean testing.  Will therefore reserve judgement on waterproofing.-  Some minor view screen scratching after brief use.-  Good quality pictures for casual viewing however they don't handle enlargement well.  Tend to be a bit grainy.Update:Took it out for underwater testing to 100 feet (with marine pack).  Well pleased with picture quality for this price range cameras.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excelent!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Jenny", "ReviewID": "R3UTVX2ESJ9RJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera, is thin, pretty and also the pictures are terrific. underwater is good.

I thought I couldn't go wrong w the newest waterproof version!The camera is great during the day and ok underwater. I do not like the quality of picture in low light. It also has a setting where it takes 2 pictures at one time and I can not get this setting to turn off.I'm sure I just need to sit down for a few hours a learn the ends and outs however just don't have that time!The older version was a simple point and shoot that made an amazing pic everytime!

We got some great shots using the burst mode of our friends jumping off the high dive.  I'm impressed with the ease of taking panoramas and even having people who were moving still be in focus.  I also like the low light feature of taking multiple pictures and combining them instead of holding the shutter open.  The pictures in low light seem to be less prone to blur.We haven't actually used this camera underwater.  Not something I plan to do, but we did take it with us to a water park and had no problems.  I did store the camera in a case in any high speed rides...it was actually small enough to fit in one of those waterproof cases that one can wear around the neck.The touch screen in the back is great. Not as sensitive as an iPhone but good enough.  I did purchase one of those clear films to cover it to prevent scratches.The main con we've seen so far is battery life.  It drains it very fast.  We just purchased a second battery for it because of this.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Sony camera", "Author": "Hayri Izgi", "ReviewID": "R2UJA5X896G7BK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My girlfriend lovs this camera i purchased for her..She made extensive use of it in our recent trip..Very portable and easy to use..We havent tried the waterproof attribute but i have no doubt it works great..i recommend it..", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "not waterproof", "Author": "cirrusdragon", "ReviewID": "R2SW7MWZJTMP0H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "leaked first time in the water at about five feet.  buy a canon, it has a better picture anyway.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buena Camara para llevarla a todos lados", "Author": "Alba J.
