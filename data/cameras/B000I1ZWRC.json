{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice upgrade of the popular Digital Rebel Series!", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "RKNBNWNIEBE2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[This is the same review I posted for the kit.  If you're getting the body because you don't like the 18-55 lens, keep in mind that some dealers offer this camera in a kit with the much nicer 17-85 USM IS (image stabalization) zoom.]The new Digital Rebel XTi camera should appeal to a wide variety of users: those wishing to upgrade from a point & shoot digital, or those wishing to improve upon their first generation digital SLRs.  Features and value make this a 5-star camera, but it won't be everyone's cup of tea.Compared to the previous Digital Rebel XT, important improvements are:1) 10.1 megapixels.  In digital camera circles, this is like saying a car has more horsepower than an older car.  While this alone doesn't mean \"better\" pictures, in reality, combined with other improvements in hardware & software, the results typically are better.;2) 2.5\" LCD panel.  This alone has more than one advantage.  The obvious first one is that our pictures look larger in review.  The second, and for someone approaching 50 (like myself), is that the LCD is now used for all the camera's data (shutter speed, aperture, shots left, etc.).  It's much easier to read than the small LCD typically located on the top of the cameras.  It might use up the batteries quicker, but, heck, if you can see the info this much easier, then so be it.  One complaint, it does not appear that the data rotates when you do verticals (like the Sony Alpha 100).;3) 9-point AF.  The number of points are improved from 7, but the real key here is that it's the system from the 30D, which had a much higher degree of accuracy than the previous Rebels.;4) Picture Styles.  I didn't really appreciate them at first, but simply put, this is like the days of film, when we could use a \"portrait\" film or \"landscape\" film.  For those that don't like to do a lot of computer work, these can be VERY handy in getting the right look in the camera.;5) Dust cleaning system.  OK, I think the dust problem will probably be a little overblown, now that Canon offers a solution, but it is a real, if not great, threat.  Additionally, the way Canon has implemented it is second to none.  The first is through hardware.  An ultrasonic filter can simply shake the dust off.  Second is through software.  If you spot a nasty piece that won't shake off, you can do a reference shot, and have the dust removed by software on your computer.;6)The grip has been improved a little.  The rubber on the grip is improved, and an anti-slip strip has been placed on the back where the right thumb goes.Most all other things Canon is know for still exists.  The camera focus fast and quietly.  Camera operations are quick and easy to locate and use.  Pictures look great.Now for the other side.  This is an unusual time in that all the big players are comming out with a 10 megapixel camera at the same time, so the Canon has some stiff competition.  Here goes a simple comparison.1) Compared to the other two cameras already available, the Sony A100 and Nikon D80 (both also 5-star cameras), the XTi is considerably smaller, and somewhat lighter.  Some will like this, even some with medium to medium-large hands.  But most people with larger, and some with somewhat smaller hands may prefer the other two choices.;2) The battery is somewhat smaller than its rival's, and may drain a bit faster due to the LCD being used for info all the time.;3) Functionally, the rear LCD is not as nice as the Sony's.  The Sony's rotates, can be set to enlarged type (50+ user again), and the system that turns it off as your eye approaches also starts the AF on the Sony.  [Although many like the top LCD, the Nikon way of needing to push a button on the back, then peak over the top to see what you're setting is not as nice].;4) No in camera stabalization.  The A100 can shift the sensor to help eliminate camera shake.  Nikon and Canon require you to purchase rather expensive lenses to get the anti-shake.;Also, soon to be added to the competion will be the Pentax K10D.  Specs are sketchy right now, but it appears to be enter the competition as a 10 megapixel camera with built-in anti-shake (much like their K100D).Of these 3 currently on the market, the Canon is the least expensive; therefore, it's up to the other 2 to show they are worth more, a very difficult task, indeed.", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "If you're coming from Point and Shoot Cameras", "Author": "I. Wan", "ReviewID": "REOHD98YPRQIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You'll find plenty of technical reviews on the web regarding features and specs for this camera.The best thing I think I can provide is my short experience with this camera, so if you used to have a high end P&S; camera and is looking to dive into the DSLR world, you are where I was a few weeks ago.I owned a Sony F717 which I really loved, but honestly, all I did was set it to Auto and take good pictures. The problem was that I had a toddler at home that doesn't really like to wait till the camera took a few secs to focus and take the pic. I was missing those smiles and moments just because the Sony couldn't take pics fast enough.I decided to look into newer cameras... Initially my budget was around $400 and I was looking to buy the Canon S3. But after spending several weeks online reading reviews (like you probably are right now), I decided that I wanted a DSLR (you'll find plenty of technical reasons in the web and other reviews). I was then ready to buy the Canon Xt (But the Xti was just around the corner, so I decided to wait a couple more weeks and when the Xti was finally released on Sep 1st, I went to Best Buy and got mine)It's my third week with the camera, and I'm loving it. I can take pictures of my son faster than he can say \"bugga bugga bugga\". While I'm still learning how to use the camera to its potential (I've been trying to learn how to shoot pictures in manual mode instead of full automatic), I've been fully satisfied with the results so far.If you're doing what I did last month, you're probably reading tons of reviews of this camera, the Canon Xt, Nikon D50, Nikon D70, Nikon D80, etc. Don't waste your time on the details.. They're all excellent cameras, and if you're coming from P&S;, any of these cameras will be an awesome one for you to learn.I warn you though. The biggest danger of buying this camera is that you'll soon be lusting after lenses... Now I spend hours on the web checking reviews of Canon, Sigma and Tamron lenses, and believe it or not, it's much harder to buy lenses than to buy a camera.PS: A Great book I I got was \"Understanding Exposure\" by Bryan Peterson. I actually got the book before the camera, and it was one of the main deciding factors that got me into DSLR instead of a pro P&S.; The pictures that Bryan shows in this book are amazing and you need control. Now I'm paranoid with getting the smallest Depth of Field possible in my son's pictures (You'll understand this if you get this book or any other that explains concepts of Exposure)Update (10/04): After weeks digging forums and reviews, I decided to purchase 2 lenses... The canon 50 f1.8 and the canon 70-300 IS. I'm not going to go over the details for these lenses in this review, but wanted to let you guys know that deciding which camera was the easy part. Deciding the lenses is where all the pain resides.", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Difficult Decision (30D vs. XTi)", "Author": "Brian Koch \"Aspiring Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "RT8OV06UVQ9US", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the Rebel XT and about 8 lenses and was thinking of getting an upgraded second camera body.  So when it came out the 30D was a logical choice, but it was not really much of an upgrade from the 20D, which I resisted, so I was not really sure what to do.  Then I had all but decided to just take the plunge and get the 30D when I heard the first rumblings about the XTi.Then I started to learn the details about the XTi, more mega pixels, same auto focus, same screen, picture styles, dust cleaning!  The only areas that the 30D won in my opinion were build quality, spot meter, and estimated shutter life.  Those 3 categories were not enough to convince me that the 30D was worth $300-$400 more than the XTi especially since the XTi had won or tied in most categories.  The way I look at it is that the camera bodies are not nearly as important as the lenses, they change so fast that it is not worth it to me to spend more for longevity when it will be outdated in a year anyway.  Spend $1,500 on a lens, use it for a lifetime, spend $1,500 on a camera body, regret it in a year.  I fully expect the upgrade to the 30D to be released within a year, and now that I have saved by getting the XTi I will have all that much more to put towards it when it comes out.So basically what I am saying is that, in my opinion, the XTi is just as good, if not better than the semi-pro 30D, so why pay more?  Switching from the XT to the XTi was very simple, I can use them both now without any problems.  The batteries, battery grips, remote shutter release, and most of the other accessories are also compatible with both, which is nice to keep the amount of gear you need to carry to a minimum.Unless you want to move up to a full frame sensor, I can't see any reasons why you would not want to go with this camera.  If you read books on photography from just 1 or 2 years ago you will realize that this \"entry level\" camera has features that were not even available on top of the line ($5,000+) camera bodies.  With the speed that camera bodies advance you might as well buy the entry level body every year instead of making a huge investment in the pro level bodies and then being shown up by something 10% of that price in a year or two.  Not that there are not reasons to buy one of those bodies, I just don't seem have any of them.", "Date": "November 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great for travelers and DSLR newcomers", "Author": "NutMac \"NutMac\"", "ReviewID": "R188J8M9OVWIVF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With emphasis on portability, Canon's Digital Rebel XTi is designed for first-time DSLR photographers and travel enthusiasts. Measuring 5.0\" by 3.7\" by 2.6\" and weighing 1.1 lbs., it is about as large as the largest point & shoot cameras and one of the smallest DSLR camera bodies on the market. Its size is the source of both popularity and criticisms. If you have large hands or a heavier lens, it may feel too small. An optional battery grip can help, but some will want something more substantial. Visit a store nearby to find out for yourself.The package includes camera body with a lens cap, battery, charger, manual, catalogs, neck strap, USB and composite video cables, and CD-ROMs. You will need a lens and CompactFlash memory card. There may be some static energy in the packaging, so remove the lens cap in a dust-free environment such as the bathroom to prevent dust entering the sensor. Much promoted sensor cleaning system helps, but it's best not to get any in the first place.Canon sells 4 versions of XTi: black or silver finish and with or without EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens. Black or silver is largely a personal preference, but most lenses, most accessories, and all but low-end DSLR camera bodies are black. As for the kit lens, it can be an affordable introduction to DSLR and capable if used exclusively at f/8 or f/11 apertures (soft at other apertures). In other words, the lens is not ideal for shooting under low light. If you don't have to get a zoom lens now, start with Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II. It is famous for top-notch performance at very low price. Due to XTi's APS-C image sensor (compositions are multiplied by 1.6x), this lens becomes 35mm-equivalent of 80mm.If you have the budget for a good zoom lens, at over 100 lenses, Canon has you covered. Some of Canon's popular zoom lenses include EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM, EF 17-40mm f/4L USM, EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM, and EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM. If these are too pricey, third party vendors such as Sigma and Tamron make Canon-compatible lenses for less. Their focus is not as nice as Canon's USM but they generally outperform Canon's lower-end lenses.Tamron's SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 Di II LD Aspherical (IF) and Sigma's 18-50mm f/2.8 EX DC and AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC macro are popular among budget-minded photographers.With 10.1 megapixels image sensor, the XTi can benefit from sharper lenses. Although increasing the resolution over same image sensor area can increase noise, Canon has improved the sensor technology to maintain low noise floor and high dynamic range. Performance wise, there's very little to criticize. Great example of Canon's trademark smooth, high contrast, saturated, and low noise. Noise remains low even at ISO 800. It is said that shooting RAW is equivalent to getting an extra exposure (1.0 EV) and it can help you maintain usable details with acceptable noise at ISO 1600. Low noise gives XTi a bit of an excuse for missing in-body image stabilizer. According to Canon, lens is more effective location for image stabilizer, especially telephoto. That's true but I think the feature would've been nice to have. As a consolation, the XTi has mirror lockup that reduces vibration caused by the mirror movement. My sole performance criticism is the metering mode. It includes only partial and not spot metering mode (very useful when shooting high contrast scenes such as candlelit birthday cake). Perhaps more problematic is the evaluative metering mode, which occasionally underexposes images by 2/3 EV or so.Some have criticized XTi for \"plasticky\" build. Except for the metal lens mount, the exterior is largely made of high quality engineering plastic with rubbery paint. If you drop it, it will probably crack or break, but it's sturdy and well made. Flipping on the power lever, it starts up almost immediately ready for use. Much promoted auto sensor cleaning kicks in when powering up and down. As with most DSLRs, there's virtually no shutter lag and it focuses in a split second (especially when using a USM lens). In continuous shooting mode with a fast memory card, it can take 10 RAWs or 27 JPEGs at 3 frames per second. RAW images are 10 MB each, so get a speed 2 GB or larger memory card, such as SanDisk's Ultra II series.Replacing both 1.8\" LCD and info display is 2.5\" high resolution LCD with LED backlighting. It displays current camera settings, photos in memory, and menu. Thanks to greater real estate and more refined user interface, XTi is very intuitive and pleasure to use. The minus is 10% lower battery life, which was merely adequate to begin with. XTi has 95% crop 0.8x optical viewfinder that displays 9 auto focus points, shutter speed, aperture, and more, but misses ISO speed, white balance, and metering mode. Overall, XTi's viewfinder is more than adequate but pales to Nikon D80's larger and more comprehensive one.Highlights of software package are ImageBrowser (Mac OS X Universal Binary), ZoomBrowser (Windows), and Digital Photo Professional (Mac OS X Universal Binary and Windows). ImageBrowser and ZoomBrowser are easy-to-weight lightweight applications for managing JPEG and RAW. Digital Photo Professional is considerably more powerful and lets you use XTi's dust delete data feature for removing dust its sensor cleaning hardware couldn't remove.", "Date": "November 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "excellent camera, but don't get the kit!", "Author": "Graham", "ReviewID": "R3U5U9SUCSUU1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the 400d/XTi for about 2 weeks now, and I love it.  Shutter response is very fast, and the LCD is easily readible, even in very bright conditions.  The 9 point AF is far superior to the 7 point AF offered on the 300 and 350d models, and the added resolution (10.08 MP) is a nice bonus.  The anti-dust protection, particularly the automatic sensor cleaning, is great as I change lenses quite often.I'm sad to say that the 400d has replaced my (more expensive) 30d for most applications.  The 30d clearly has a better build quality, but that's the only advantage I can see at this point.  If you want a lightweight, moderately inexpensive prosumer-grade camera, the 400d is about as good as you can get for the money.PLEASE NOTE: if you are new to digital photography, the camera is important, but lenses are FAR MORE IMPORTANT.  If you want to get great results with the 400d, you're going to have to buy good lenses.  The kit lens (18-55, NOT USM) sucks -- it makes a good paperweight, but that's it.  If you're a beginner I'd recommend the 50mm f/1.8 MK II (or the f/1.4, if you can afford it) to start.  The f/1.8 MK II is cheaper than the kit lens, and while it's a prime (doesn't allow you to zoom) it's much sharper in low light conditions (and the f/1.4 is even sharper than the f/1.8).Overall, I give this camera a 9 out of 10.  For the price, it's the best you can get.  Just remember, lenses are more important than the camera.  A 300d with L-series lenses will outperform a 400d with low/consumer grade lenses in all settings.  If you already have a 300 or 350d, save your money and invest it in better optics.  If you don't already have a dslr, this is perhaps the best entry-level model on the market.", "Date": "October 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Gem of a Camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Dulcimer Maker\"", "ReviewID": "R1QBZSRWLDDUI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Rebel EOS Digital XTi 400D to upgrade my almost 3-year old Rebel EOS Digital 300D (which, by the way, is still a great camera). I won't go into the technical differences between the two cameras, but I will say this: the differences between the two cameras are worth the cost of the upgrade for me. Here's why.Although too much can be made of additional pixels, the upgrade from 6 mega-pixels to 10.1 mega-pixels simply means that more data is available to process pictures. I shoot in RAW mode, so I'll take all the additional information I can get.The larger LCD screen on the 400D is much, much, much better than that on the 300D. I really like a) the much larger view of each picture taken, and b) the clarity of the camera settings when displayed on the screen. I also really like the feature that automatically turns off the screen when the camera is raised to the eye for composition. I honestly didn't realize how tiny the 300D LCD is until comparing it to the 400D. Thank you, Canon, for the bigger screen!I also like that the 400D comes with new, selectable Picture Styles (Standard, Portrait, Landscape, Neutral and Faithful) that automatically make small corrections to things like sharpness, contrast and color.The camera start-up time on the 400D is also significantly quicker than that of the 300D. I once missed what I now think is the shot of a lifetime because I couldn't get the 300D to start up fast enough. I believe the 400D would have gotten the shot.It's also much easier to select the type of Auto Focus mode on the 400D. When your camera is set to shoot in One Shot mode, but you find yourself in the middle of movement and action, the 400D makes it easy and fast to switch to AI Focus or AI Servo - essential for sports shots.For those who have come to appreciate and rely on the histogram to determine proper exposure, you now have the choice between Brightness and RGB.I also like the increased continuous shooting speed of almost 3 frames-per-second. A very nice feature when shooting the dog, kids playing or outdoor events.Finally, for those who are concerned about dust on the sensor, the new automatica sensor cleaning capabiltiy is a very nice to have.On the downside, the 400D camera grip is a bit too small for larger hands. It's manageable, but not as comfortable as the grip on the 300D. However, I mostly solved this problem by attaching an Opteka battery grip, which enlarged the grip surface.Also, the smaller battery size on the 400D means that you can't interchange batteries between the 300D and the 400D. It also means that the (optional) battery grip that worked on the 300D does not fit on the 400D.BOTTOM LINEAm I happy that I upgraded from the 300D to the 400D? You bet. I'd do it again in a heart beat.Would I recommend this camera to the serious amateur? Absolutely. It's worth every penny to someone getting his or her first Digital SLR or upgrading from the 300D.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera, but don't buy the kit lens", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R8JGSC5LB2UE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned a Canon Rebel film SLR that I used well into 2002.  Like many others, I got tired of paying for film, so I made the switch to digital, buying a point-and-shoot.  It wasn't until I purchased this Rebel SLR in March of 2007 that I realized how much I missed my SLR!I purchased the body only because I had a lot of Canon gear that was still compatible with the digital SLR.  Buying the Canon was therefore, an easy choice for me.  However, I did compare the Canon to the Nikon D40 and D80 and found that the Canon compared very favorably, dollar-for-dollar.The Canon Rebel XTi has a very high-quality feel about it.  It is very well made, with rubber grips at all the right contact points, buttons and doors that feel \"made for the long run,\" EXCELLENT bundled software, and fast camera-to-PC transfer times.  Unlike a lot of other electronics purchases I've made recently, it comes will full versions of all of its software- no \"lite\" versions requiring you to pay more for the full version.  And again, the software is EXCELLENT.  It is much better than the software that came bundled with my Kodak point-and-shoot.Even if you don't have any Canon lenses in your arsenal, I'd still advise against buying the kit with the lens.  The lens included with the kit is not a great lens- it won't disappoint, mind you, but it's not a high-quality optics lens.  Most local camera stores are offering Canon-sponsored specials that allow you to buy the body and a separate lens for about the same price as the Camera kit.  This would be a much better deal.  Note that the only difference between the \"Kit\" and the \"Body Only\" is the kit lens.  The \"Body Only\" still includes all of the cables, software, manuals, battery, and charger.If you're interested in flexing the camera's true muscle by shooting multiple frames at high resolution (I've gotten mine to fire 49 straight frames in about 17 seconds) you'll want to get a top-quality Compact Flash card; the camera does not come with one.  Note that there are differences in memory cards with respect to read and write speeds.  I purchased the SanDisk Extreme III 4GB card.  The Extreme III line is capable of 20MB/sec min write and read speeds.  Check other cards carefully-  I've tried the slower cards and the camera cannot respond as quickly as you might want with slower cards.This is an excellent camera-  it takes high-quality 10MP JPEG images with excellent color depth, white balance, and clarity, with as little or as much control as you care to specify.  You can use it as a novice's point-and-shoot, or a professional's wedding camera, and get excellent results every time.", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good", "Author": "Spud", "ReviewID": "R17PA0I2C35PQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was comparison-shopping between the Canon Rebel XTi, Nikon D80 and Sony Alpha DSLR-A100. Issues that matter most to me are ISO performance, image stabilization and dust removal capability. The best information that I was able to gather from various professional reviews before my purchase decision is as follows:ISO performance: The XTi and D80 are pretty much on a par, but with the D80 having a slight edge in being able to push it up to 3200 (with decreased resolution at that setting though). The Sony starts to fall behind at ISO 800 with noise issues and at ISO 1600 with other image quality issues as well.Image Stabilization: Sony has an edge in terms of cost-effectivenes because of the use of an in-camera IS system. With Canon and Nikon, you have to pay extra for lenses with IS.Dust Removal: Canon provides both hardware and software solutions. Sony provides hardware only. Nikon provides neither.I decided to take a chance on the XTi and bought the camera with kit lens about 10 days ago. Since then, I was snapping shots everywhere at various camera settings, testing its limits. First off, I was very impressed with the lightning quick performance of the camera. I was also stunned by the amazing picture quality that the kit lens is capable of providing, especially after so much snob from numerous professional photographers on this \"cheap\" lens. The most tell-tale signs are various hand-held head shots taken indoor at ISO settings of 800 and 1600 (without flash nor any additional lighting). I was able to capture all the vivid details of the skin complexion of a human face, including every little pore, hair, bum, wrinkle, and even subtle skin discoloration.Excited over the amazing performance of this new camera, I decided to add a zoom lens to it and I bought the Canon EF 70-300 mm F/4-5.6 IS USM zoom lens five days ago. I took it to the park two days later to take pictures of our dog and her canine buddies.  It was already 6:45pm when we arrived at the park.  With Image Stabilization functions on, hand held, ISO fixed at 1600 and no flash, I snapped both still shots and light-duty action shots from a distance at various focal lengths. I was still able to get quite a number of high-quality letter-size printouts from these shots.So far, I am very happy with the camera and the two lenses.  There are a few things I would wish for though. I wish the XTi would have a larger viewfinder (both the D80 and A100 have larger viewfinders), illuminated buttons (for night shots), and more reasonable prices on Canon's lens hoods (the lens hood for the above-mentioned zoom lens costs an outrageous $45).", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but the included Macintosh software is tricky to install", "Author": "Alan Somers", "ReviewID": "R1DO97U9CQ8O4J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been wanting a digital SLR for a long time and with the introduction of the Canon Digital Rebel XTi, I decided the time was right.  My experiences are based on about 7 years of point-and-shoot zoom cameras and, before that, a manual focus Canon A-1 film SLR.As SLRs go, the camera is very compact out of the box.  Unfortunately, it didn't stay that way after I attached the optional BG-E3 battery grip.  It feels very solid regardless of the attachments, but I think it's a little easier to handle with the extra bulk of the battery grip, which also allows for up to three times the battery power of the standard Li-ion battery when used with the high capacity NiMH AA batteries currently available,The lens included in the kit is passable, especially if you can't afford a better lens, but I found that a Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens gives noticeably sharper images.  I will be using the kit lens only when I need 18-24mm focal lengths.One of the first things that impressed me when I started using the camera was the autofocus speed.  It is really fast and works well in lighting conditions that would make my Canon PowerShot S1 IS's autofocus choke.  It uses the flash as a focus assist light when the light gets too low for the autofocus to work unassisted.The controls are well laid out.  They provide one-button access to white balance settings, ISO settings, autofocus modes, and exposure modes.  Exposure compensation is accomplished almost as easily: turn the dial next to the shutter release while holding down the aperture/exposure compensation button with your thumb.My only complaints center around the difficulty with which the included Macintosh software installed.  First of all, unlike software installers for any other package I've installed under OS X, which give you the opportunity to authenticate with an admin name and password even when installed from a normal user account, the installer for the included software does not.  Therefore, you *must* install the software while logged into an admin account.  This is very bad installer design IMHO.Secondly, the Digital Photo Professional application would not operate correctly when run in a normal user account unless it was run once in an admin account.  I presume that the first run installs some extra software (plugins or drivers?) in a location only writable by an admin user.  Before I figured this out, the app would not decode nor process RAW images, more often than not resulting in the SBOD (spinning beachball of death) and requiring a force-quit of the app.  However, once I got it working, the software worked well on the RAW images I had captured with the camera.  I was able to brighten up a slightly underexposed RAW photo of one of my cats in a particularly expressive pose by about 0.5 stops with no noticeable quality loss.I would heartily recommend this camera to anyone who has been disappointed with the image quality, speed, and other limitations of a point-and-shoot.", "Date": "September 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best Canon yet-400D", "Author": "Smoky Mountain Photo \"advanced amateur\"", "ReviewID": "R36NI9D2SRV1EO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll keep this short,as I assume most of the tec stuff has been covered.I sold a 350D to get the 400D(XTi).The 400D focuses better,has better ergonomics,is the same size/weight,and takes GREAT photos.I tried a Nikon D80,but it loses way too much detail at iso 400 and up.Plus the Canon line of lenses fits my needs better,are cheaper,and are available.The Nikon costs $300 more (with the Canon being discounted),and the Nikon Raw converter adds another $150.So the true cost difference is $400-450.

I don't use the kit zoom lens anymore because I favor the faster, prime lenses.  I mostly take pictures of my children, and the 85mm f/1.8 is an excellent portrait lens.  It is sharp, fast, and produces beautiful background blur.  Zoom lenses unfortunately are not as sharp or fast, unless you're willing to pay much more than the cost of the camera body.I think all novice SLR owners should buy the cheap Canon 50mm f/1.8, to discover what a fast lens can do when you set the aperture to 1.8, and take some portraits.

Features and value make this a 5-star camera, but it won't be everyone's cup of tea.Compared to the previous Digital Rebel XT, important improvements are:1) 10.1 megapixels.  In digital camera circles, this is like saying a car has more horsepower than an older car.  While this alone doesn't mean \"better\" pictures, in reality, combined with other improvements in hardware & software, the results typically are better.;2) 2.5\" LCD panel.  This alone has more than one advantage.  The obvious first one is that our pictures look larger in review.  The second, and for someone approaching 50 (like myself), is that the LCD is now used for all the camera's data (shutter speed, aperture, shots left, etc.).  It's much easier to read than the small LCD typically located on the top of the cameras.  It might use up the batteries quicker, but, heck, if you can see the info this much easier, then so be it.  One complaint, it does not appear that the data rotates when you do verticals (like the Sony Alpha 100).;3) 9-point AF.  The number of points are improved from 7, but the real key here is that it's the system from the 30D, which had a much higher degree of accuracy than the previous Rebels.;4) Picture Styles.  I didn't really appreciate them at first, but simply put, this is like the days of film, when we could use a \"portrait\" film or \"landscape\" film.  For those that don't like to do a lot of computer work, these can be VERY handy in getting the right look in the camera.;5) Dust cleaning system.  OK, I think the dust problem will probably be a little overblown, now that Canon offers a solution, but it is a real, if not great, threat.  Additionally, the way Canon has implemented it is second to none.  The first is through hardware.  An ultrasonic filter can simply shake the dust off.  Second is through software.  If you spot a nasty piece that won't shake off, you can do a reference shot, and have the dust removed by software on your computer.;6)The grip has been improved a little.  The rubber on the grip is improved, and an anti-slip strip has been placed on the back where the right thumb goes.Most all other things Canon is know for still exists.  The camera focus fast and quietly.  Camera operations are quick and easy to locate and use.  Pictures look great.Now for the other side.  This is an unusual time in that all the big players are comming out with a 10 megapixel camera at the same time, so the Canon has some stiff competition.  Here goes a simple comparison.1) Compared to the other two cameras already available, the Sony A100 and Nikon D80 (both also 5-star cameras), the XTi is considerably smaller, and somewhat lighter.  Some will like this, even some with medium to medium-large hands.  But most people with larger, and some with somewhat smaller hands may prefer the other two choices.;2) The battery is somewhat smaller than its rival's, and may drain a bit faster due to the LCD being used for info all the time.;3) Functionally, the rear LCD is not as nice as the Sony's.  The Sony's rotates, can be set to enlarged type (50+ user again), and the system that turns it off as your eye approaches also starts the AF on the Sony.  [Although many like the top LCD, the Nikon way of needing to push a button on the back, then peak over the top to see what you're setting is not as nice].;4) No in camera stabalization.  The A100 can shift the sensor to help eliminate camera shake.  Nikon and Canon require you to purchase rather expensive lenses to get the anti-shake.;Also, soon to be added to the competion will be the Pentax K10D.  Specs are sketchy right now, but it appears to be enter the competition as a 10 megapixel camera with built-in anti-shake (much like their K100D).Of these 3 currently on the market, the Canon is the least expensive; therefore, it's up to the other 2 to show they are worth more, a very difficult task, indeed.", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Anti-dust features not that effective", "Author": "DJRob", "ReviewID": "R2WT553KQ22UGS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Dust on the image sensor is a problem inherent to all DSLR cameras. Whenever the mirror box is exposed to the environment, dust can (and will) get in and get statically attracted to the image sensor. Canon, with the ultrasonic dust cleaning feature and the image-degrading dust delete and detection software, seems in principle to have solidly addressed the problem. Unfortunately, this does not impress in practice.If you are not familiar with how sensor dust appears in photographs, look at the sample in the Product Description, where they attempt to demonstrate the strength of the dust management features- or go to pbase.com and look at samples of the XTi from regular, everyday users. In particular, look for samples that have lots of blue sky. The dust will appear as spots/dots or splotches. The more your lens is stopped down (small aperture, >f10), the more prominent the dust spot in the image.I purchased an XTi body and Canon's EF 28-135mm USM lens from Amazon and, in my rather clean office, I carefully unpacked the camera and lens from their display boxes and immediately mated the two. I only had one lens, so the two were never unpaired. I took the camera on a mountain trip and was horrified to find dust spots on many of my shots. At first I thought I got something on the lens filter (purchased separately) but no. The spots appear in the exact same spot from shot to shot and become sharper if the aperture is stopped down. They are non-existent when the lens is wide or moderately open (shallow depth of field).Before I enflame a bunch of pro photographers, once I realized the dust was present on my images, I ran through the forced cleaning and allowed the camera to map the dust for removal in the DPP software. Subsequent shots of sky with small aperture revealed no improvement. Amazon instantly replaced the camera, but it was actually worse. After doing some research, I was led to the Giottos Rocket Air Blaster, but this just moved some of the spots to a different location on the sensor. I have an expectation that a factory fresh DSLR would be clean and free of debris on the image sensor. Even higher-end Canons apparently have this out-of-the-box problem- just google it. I refuse to resort to physical methods (swabs/fluid) to clean the sensor of brand new camera, the very act makes me a bit nervous.I would accept a dust problem if I changed lenses in the field, wind blowing and all, but this is not the case. However, the special dust management features of the XTi fail under the most benign conditions. I give the XTi 3 stars as a penalty for failing on the dust promise, but would give it 5 stars otherwise.

Of course the first thing you notice is the 2.5\" LCD.  With the elimination of the mini-LCD on the XT, which displayed the camera settings, everything is now on the large LCD. This is a huge improvement for us middle aged folks.  No more accidentally shooting at 1600 because this setting was buried.  The current camera settings are staring you in the face.I've just received the camera and have taken a few test shots.  The first thing I noticed is the 9 point AF is much more robust than the XTs focus system.  So much so that I will have to turn down the sharpness especially on portraits.I have a couple Canon L series lenses, and to my surprise, my initial opinion is the XTi shots seem significantly sharper than the XT.  The only thing I can attribute this to is the new AF system.As for the dust cleaning system.  Time will tell, but you do see a dust cleaning screen for a couple seconds after power up/down.For the most part, the rest of the camera is pretty much the same as an XT.  If you are used to the XT menu, you will have no problem navigating the XTi menu...it's the same.  USB Interface, batteries, charger etc...all the same as the XT.

Perhaps Canon will lose some 30D sales until they upgrade the 30D to 10mp.

For me, the quality of professionally done prints is the biggest measure of a camera or lense. I will be brief and to the point:1. Do not use the kit lense. This camera deserves high quality lenses. If tight on budget, buy the 50mm 1.8 EF MK II. It is a cheap but very high quality lense. This is the lense I use with my XTi.2. I just received my first set of prints (4x6). I have never taken pictures as good as this. My previous gear was Rebel (film) and the same 50mm lense. So, I can make a decent comparison between 35mm film and digital. The prints from XTi are stunningly better than anything I ever managed with film. The sharpness and perception of depth in the prints are nothing short of dazzling.3. Do not worry too much about how the pictures look on screen. XTi produces very high fidelity colors which may look a bit dull on the monitor. Your natural tendency might be to tweak the images to increase the color saturation. Do not do it (unless you wish to display the images on screen only). Prints are absolutely stunning in color accuracy and more vivid than screen.If you are waiting for digital to catch up with film, do not wait any longer. The battle between 35mm and digital is over. Having said that, incredible things are still coming down the technology pipe. If you are really serious, you may want to wait for these:  - Built in High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography.  - Resolution that matches medium format film (15mp).  - More affordable image stabilization.

But since everyone else is proclaiming its virtues, I will write mainly about its negatives. There aren't too many, but it does have a few drawbacks; a couple of which I just don't understand.  This camera is now the fourth digital camera I have bought. The first was the Nikon Coolpix 995 for my wife. The second was the Sony F707 for me. The third was the Canon SD400 for my wife. And lastly the XTi for me. So I have had a little experience with cameras at or near \"prosumer\" level. This is why I find it hard to believe how the XTi can get some of these things wrong.  First of all is the white balance. Of my 4 cameras, this camera has, by far, the worst indoors Auto White Balance. I am using compact fluorescent light bulbs and daylight lights in the house and the XTi makes everything look yellow. And none of the other white balance options is close either. The one saving grace is the Custom White Balance option. You perform this Custom White Balance by taking a picture of something gray (preferably a large gray piece of paper or a card made just for this, and have it centered in the picture) and then selecting this picture as the Custom White Balance reference. After doing this the White Balance is nothing short of superb. I even had it work just by zooming in on something white and then selecting it as the reference picture. (I guess white works just as well as gray.)  But my disappointment is, \"Why does this have to be done at all?\" All three other cameras of mine handle this lighting much better than the XTi. But what's really the saddest is that the Canon Elph handles it better than the XTi.  It's nice that, after some hassle, it does have good white balance. But I shouldn't have to carry around a gray card everywhere I go or touch up every photo I take to get the right white balance. Especially when a 1 \u00bd year old Canon does it better, for half the price.  My next gripe is the lack of spot metering.  It wouldn't bother me so much if:1) The other metering options were more consistent.2) Every other camera I own didn't have it.3) Canon Tech Support hadn't told me that they reserve Spot Metering for their higher end cameras.....Especially when their own [...] has it!! How is a $500 camera higher end than the XTi?  Usually I can select partial metering and then turn up the exposure about 1/3 to 2/3 of a stop and get decent exposure. But it would be much more consistent to just have a spot metering option; especially with backlit subjects, or with a lot of harsh, low sun and shade in the picture.  My last gripe is about the included software, especially with RAW pictures. Don't even try loading this software on anything but a dual-core or 4 GHz PC. The software is ssslllooowww!!! For one thing, both the Zoombrowser EX and Digital Photo Professional start scanning the hard drive for pictures as soon as the software loads, and there doesn't seem to be any way to stop it. If you have a lot of pictures on your computer, it will take a long, long time before the software lets you do anything. Make sure you have coffee ready! The other thing is that the software is just a memory hog and runs excruciatingly slow; especially when trying to edit RAW or .cr2 files. Speaking of which, why does Canon have to use such a non-standard file? I would be glad to use some other software for editing my RAW's, but Canon's proprietary files can't be opened by other \"normal\" programs. So for now I'll just stick to .jpg's. Then there's the other complaints, which are true. The kit lens isn't very good. The form-factor could use work. ( I am constantly hitting the FEL button on accident) and the view finder is kind of smallish; among others.  Overall I am pleased with the camera. I have some wonderful pictures already on the wall. But I've also had a few real stinkers due to the lack of spot metering and the occasional terrible white balance. If it weren't for these two (rather huge for me) issues, than I would give the XTi 5 stars. But until Canon fixes these glaring issues it won't be given my highest rating.

This was my first digital camera purchase.  I researched digital cameras on the internet and decided to get the Canon Digital Rebel XTi.  My reasons for getting this camera are:1.  No shutter lag - This means that when you press the button to take the picture, the camera takes the picture at that moment.  This is a very important issue when taking things that happen all of a sudden.  A friend of mine had a little pocket digital camera at spring break...lets just say he was very disipointed with the shutter lag on his camera.2.  View finder - Maybe I am so used to my regular 35mm film camera that I just have to have a view finder.  A lot of the point and shoot cameras don't have a view finder.  You have to use the LCD screen to see what you are looking at.  That can be handy if you are holding the camera away from your face to take a picture.  But I like to look at what I want to take the picture of and bring the camera up to my eye...done.  No trouble finding exactly what you want to shoot.  Remember, with the XTi camera, the LCD screen only shows the picture after you take it.  You can't use the LCD to view what you want to take.3.  The feel - Again, probably from my 35mm camera, but I just love the feel of a regular sized camera in my hand.4.  Continuous shooting - This is a fast camera for taking multiple shots in a row.  Great for action shots.5.  The Price - This is still not a cheap camera, but it is cheaper than most of the others.The things to look out for on this camera are the settings.  This camera has lots of settings and buttons.  This is a good thing, but if you are not used to cameras, it can be a lot to take in.  The only thing I noticed about this camera is on outside photos, if you get a lot of sky in the shot, it can make the rest of your photo a little on the dark side.  There are settings to correct for this.  So over all, this is a great camera.

Well, it depends on who you are, and what you plan to use it for.  If you are looking for a point-and-shoot for snapshots, you should probably pass.  There are cheaper cameras out there (Canon Powershots, for example) that will give you what you want for less.However, if you are a semi-serious photographer, this is an extremely nice camera.  I'll skip the tech specs, as you can find those elsewhere.  Here's what counts for me:  the shots are ultra-crisp, and the camera features are phenomenal.  There are enough MPs here to do some significant enlargements, without loss of clarity.I'd rate myself an enthusiastic amateur photographer, and, in all honesty, this is probably too much camera for me.

You will find my EOS-1 review on Amazon too. With the Rebel XTi (or 400D in the rest of the world) there is now a high quality camera with the same resolution at the tenth of the price.  I bought the XTi on Amazon and have used it now for some time. I bought a Sigma DC 18-200mm zoom-lens, which is like a 27-300mm because of the smaller CCD than the EOS-1. I can highly recommend the Sigma lens because it makes the XTi an amazingly small, light but complete package that I carry around in my rucksack, which I could never do with my EOS-1.The picture quality and ease of use it absolutely amazing! In everyday conditions I cannot see a difference between the EOS-1 (which was $9000 when I bought it two years ago) and the XTi. The software is much easier to use and the camera works really well in fully automatic. The in-built flash is very good and battery life is excellent, given the small battery. I will post a few images I shot with it. I did virtually no editing on those except clipping to make them smaller. I did also buy the Canon EF 10-22mm because I need a lot of wide-angle and I will review that seperately. It is a great lens to go with the XTi.Does that make the EOS-1 obsolete? No. Mostly because it has the high quality AF lenses and a full size CCD for much better colour quality and sensitivity.

The 20D has been replaced by the 30D which sells for about $1100.00, whereas the Rebel XTi sells for under $800.00(prices for body only).  Many people ask me whether they should go for the 30D or Rebel XTi.  I've pretty much switched to my Xit as the standard camera, w/the more expensive 20D as the backup. Here's my review of the Xti and comparisons to the 20DCamera Size and HandlingThe entry level Xti is smaller and lighter than the mid-level 20/30D's.  This is an advantage for me, as I'm trying to keep the total weight of my kit as low as possible without sacrificing qualityThe Xti has fewer dedicated controls and buttons that the 20/30D's.  I expected that this would make it harder  to make adjustments(I make very frequent adjustments and never use the camera on Program). However Canon did an excellent design in arranging the buttons and functions on the rear of the camera.  While I do miss the famous Canon \"rear wheel\" which I used to dial in exposure compensation, overall, this new arrangement is just about as easy to use as the higher level cameras.ScreenThe 2.5 inch screen  is not only larger but brighter than the screen on the 20D. It's the same size as the screen on the 30D and I can't compare overall brightness.  This screen has enhanced the usability of the camera, particularly outdoors.  While no LCD screen can render a great image in bright sunlight,  I'd say I can now use this screen to get a good sense of what my image looks like in many more outdoor shooting situations than with my older camera.Dust-ReductionThis is not in the 20 or 30D's.  With my 20D I had to use a blower to clean the sensor frequently...or else I'd see spots on my images.(by frequently, I mean after about 4 days of shooting).  I have had the Rebel xti for 9 months, shot thousands of frames and have never done a manual cleaning.  The ultrasonic vibration system that automatically shakes dust off the sensor when the camera is turned on, really works.Image qualityWhile the Xti offers higher resolution compared to the 20/30D (10.2 vs 8.2mp), it's given me some problems with noise especially at 800 iso or higher.  Unlike my 20D I will not use this camera at ISO 800.  I have also noticed some issues with underexposure compared to my other camera, and the need to dial-in positive exposure compensation, especially when using Canon Speedlight.I've lived with this issue for a while, and finally called Canon.  I have to  give Canon credit as the support person spend nearly 20 minutes with me on the phone trying to diagnose the problem and rule out any user error.  I've read about this underexposure issue on some Canon user forums.  I will send my Rebel in to have the exposure calibration checked.VERDICTDespite some issues with the noise at ISO800 and the exposure, I really enjoy using this camera and have taken some great shots with it.  Originally I intended for it to be a backup to my 20D, but instead it's become my primary body.  Images can be seen on my website.PS.Since writing this review I sent the camera back to Canon to adjust the underexposure.

I purchased this camera because of the positive reviews (like this one) talking about the wonders of the features.While I love this camera, i'll give you the negative bits that I'm always looking for to give a truly balanced opinion on the features of a product; \"I love it, I love it, I love it\" doesn't convince me of whether I want to purchase it or not.In no particular order:Pros:-physically: it's small, lightweight and while plastic, still feels solid enough to put into my bag.-coming down in price, the cost of these DSLRs are really moving down.-wide assortment of lenses from many manufacturers available-the pictures are, as everyone says, amazing. the colors are rich, the default settings are pretty good in itself. I've toyed with some of the color and sharpness settings and have had good results.-easy to use, intuitive, the center \"set\" button is reprogrammable also for easy use of certain features.-great for beginners, it's designed for the consumer, not pros, and I really have learned a lot from its simplicity. Menus, instruction books, and others are simple to understand.-Great for beginning and moving up. This is my plan, as I'm finding that photography is a strong passion of mine now. I had noticed that the higher end cameras, the 5D, etc. all use the same lenses, so eventually I'd like to move up. For right now, this camera is awesome.Cons:-the size makes it difficult for my hands, I bought an extended battery grip and it fits much better. However, this makes it a bit heavier.-rear screen is not recessed. this makes me nervous that it's going to get scratched or cracked somehow. wish they'd spent a little more on plastic and pushed the screen a little deeper into the body.-the camera shows the settings on the LCD on the back. While I think this is ok, I do feel as though it shortens the battery life. You can change the settings to turn it off, but the shortest is goes is 30 seconds. I wish it had the old digital readout on the older and higher-end cameras. then you could see the settings all the time.-I do have a dead pixel on my LCD, that bummed me out, but it's not bad.-This is a wish more than a complaint, but I would like to be able to fold up the mirror and be able to see the LiveView that's available on the Olympus SLR's and the Mark III. I would think that it wouldn't be that hard to do.-I have worries about APS-C sensors being discontinued, which could mean no future lenses. But since Canon seems to have made a solid consumer-based camera line, I don't think it'll be anytime soon.Overall, it's a great camera. I recommend you get this or a Nikon over the other brands. Between this and the Nikon, get this. As a consumer-grade, this really is top of the line.", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "An Excellent Beginner's SLR", "Author": "I. Halter", "ReviewID": "R1IAD09RCARDFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned my Canon Digital Rebel XTi for almost a month now, and have taken over 1,000 pictures.  The camera seems to be holding up well and hasn't developed any problems.  It has all the features you would expect in a digital SLR, although it does lack a spot metering system, but it hasn't caused any problems that I couldn't fix by changing somthing else.  Is it a fault? Yes, but is it all that important? No, especially if you're a beginner with DSLR's.I've read a lot of reviews that criticize the kit lens, and although it is certainly less than impressive, it is an excellent beginner's lens, and it's low price helps too.  If you're a believer in \"the lens makes the picture, not the camera,\" then I would suggest buying another, higher quality lens either directly from Canon, or a slightly more cost sensitive lens from Sigma or Tamron.Back to the camera body itself.  The XTi is a bit small, especially for those of us with large hands or long fingers, but it's a lot easier to hold than a normal \"point and shoot\" camera that most casual digital photographers are used to.  Even though it's tough to hold at times, I  prefer the smaller body, but it's really personal preference (if you get a chance, go out to a store and hold one, just to make sure it's a good fit for you.)  If you can't stand the size, you should look at Nikon's entry level DSLR (the D80), or if you're willing to shell out some extra bucks, one of Canon's professional series cameras (the 30D or 5D.)Canon has updated a few things with the upgrade to their outstanding Digital Rebel XT.  The thing that will catch most people's attention first of course is the addition of 2 more megapixels, giving the XTi a total of 10.1.  However, the 2 additional megapixels comes at a price.  Although Canon increased the amount of overall pixels, the sensor (for those of you that are new to DSLR photography, the sensor takes the place of film in a camera and captures the image digitally) is roughly the same size as the one in the XT.  This produces a little more noise, but not enough to notice unless you view the picture at larger than true size.  Other changes include the loss of the small indicator LCD above the main LCD on the back, and the increase of the main LCD to 2.5 inches.  I think this was an excellent idea.  It does slightly decrease battery life because the camera has to keep the large color LCD on all the time, but it is much easier to see all of your picture settings clearly and at the same time.  Also, a rubber thumb grip (which was missing entirely in the XT) was placed on the back for a more comfortable hold as well as the addition to a rough plastic/rubber grip in the front of the camera (also missing in the XT).  There are other differences as well, including more AF points, Picture Style settings and more.  If you want to see the rest of the specifics, go to Canon's website.So, to sum it up: The XTi is an excellent upgrade to the ever-popular Rebel XT.  It is an excellent camera for beginner DSLR photographers and is portable enough for everyday use.  The plastic body does feel a bit cheap, but it's the inside that counts (just don't drop it.)  For the great price of Canon's Digital Rebel XTi, it won't dissapoint, and may be more than you expected.  So if you're serious about buying a entry level digital SLR, I would strongly suggest you purchase Canon's newest edition to their EOS lineup.Hope this was helpful!", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Simply amazing!

Sadly the same quality does not extend to the standard 18-55 kit lens, either mechanically or optically. For example...- The inner lens tube wobbles all over the place, which makes you wonder what is actually holding it in position.- Accurate manual focusing is impossible due to the amazingly poor design and build.- The lens mount is plastic.- The optics are shockingly poor. Don't expect sharp images, esp at the tele end. If you compare the optical performance of this lens to the Nikon std 18-55 kit lens, you could be forgiven for thinking that Canon are having a bit of a laugh. You can make up your own mind if you check out the \"Reviews\" section of the Photozone site (comes up via any of the search engines). Try opening two web browser sessions and size them down width ways so you can compare the two lenses side by side. I think you'll be shocked at what you see.So why does Canon ship such a poor lens as standard with this body? Beats me - its reputation is widely reported in mags and online. The sooner Canon discontinue the std 18-55 lens the better - it's absolute pap and has no place on a current day DSLR.My recommendation to anyone thinking of buying this camera is to buy the body and choose the lens separately. If you must have a Canon lens then the IS version of the 18-55 is infinitely better than the std (non-IS) 18-55 kit lens (in terms of the image quality it delivers anyway - mechanically it's not much better). Or, if you don't mind going down the third party lens route, you could opt for the Tamron 17-50 F2.8 - a cracking lens that really does justice to the superb quality and design of the body. Which to choose? The Canon IS 18-55 is cheaper, while the Tamron 17-50 is faster and significantly better in terms of image quality (sharper into the image corners and sharper at the tele end too).Happy hunting. :-)", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Outstanding camera", "Author": "Snoosh \"snoosh\"", "ReviewID": "R1V02FN68VDVC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm probably an advanced amateur in skill level.

It is full-featured, takes quality shots, and is ridiculously easy and intuitive to use, a really nice job by Canon.  It's bigger than our older, compact digital cameras but a bit smaller and a lot lighter than my venerable Nikon F film SLR's, and the power of the XTi - - range of \"film\" speeds, frames-per-minute in action mode, scenes settings, battery life, etc., are all very competitive.

ISO 1600 on this model does show noise, but it will get those night indoor bar and club shots that you won't get otherwise without using a flash.  If you have to use a flash which will cause bad shadows (and draws unwanted attention), try to use the 430EX flash or even better the 580EX.

I do recommend that you upgrade the lens right away (or rather, buy just the camera body and get the SIGMA 18-200mm OS) because the stock lens just does not cut it. Having come from P&S;, I was used to the 10X zoom and with the stock lens, you only get 3X and the high end of that is only 55mm. So save about 50bucks (which you can put towards a better lens) by just buying the camera body and you will not regret it.I have taken numerous pictures with this camera - from regular day photos to stunning night time shots. I just could not believe the quality of the details of the night time pics. If you are afraid of the perceived \"complications\" that DSLRs seem like having, you have nothing to fear. I was able to take the camera out of the box, and start shooting right away. Afterwards, I read the manual to get a feel for what each knob did and have not looked back ever since.To help you improve your shooting skills, I do recommend getting a good book which will help explain aperture, shutter speed, and other camera linggo.

(I retired to taking action shots of my newborn granddaughter)This camera is EVERYTHING you could ever need. The 10MP lets me take macro shots as close as 15\" (using the new Tamron 18-250mm lens) and blow them up to 20\"x30\" posters that are good enough to display in exhibition or to sell!The shutter is instantanous and the exposure meter is astounding.

On the freeway back into town I had to slam on the brakes. The cola cooler on the seat fell forward and a half quart of water (thawed ice)spilled directly onto the floor and camera. I grabbed the XTi and immediately took out the card and battery, then rubbed everything dry. I then waited until morning allowing EVERYTHING to dry out.

The Canon is the best value of a very good set of contenders from Nikon and Sony. The sensor in the camera is 24 mm (larger is better -- we will soon see a 35 mm sensor). This camera can use legacy Canon lenses as well as the new EFS (short focus in the back specifically for digital EOS). Because the sensor is not 35mm, you have to multiply lens length by a conversion factor, in this case 1.6, to get 35 mm equivalent (example: a 50mm lens will give the same result as an 80mm on a 35 SLR).The kit lens is ok but not great.

The Xt and Xti came out on top.  I went to a local store to handle one in person before I bought it online.  One thing I had forgotten is that with a slr camera I have to use my hand to twist the lens to the desired closeness or depth, and then when I press the shutter button slightly it will focus the subject into clarity.  --Previously, I thought pushing the button would do it all!  I miss the ease of the point and shoot, and the size, but I love being able to use interchangeable lenses.  A wide angle for Thanksgiving dinner, classroom photos, etc.  And my telephoto lens for getting closeups without needing to be so close up and disturbing the scene, i.e. attracting attention to myself and distracting the little kids in my daughters class while taking pictures of them playing.

The only downside to the light weight is that when I put my biggish zoom lens on it, it feels unbalanced, especially on a tripod.

The image stabilizer lets me hand-hold it with acceptable-to-me results down to about 1/30 sec - better with a tripod of course but that's not always an option.If you're considering jumping to SLR for the first time, it's well worth looking into a class or a beginner's book or video.

I'm using lenses from my Canon EOS camera of a few years ago and they work wonderfully with the Digital Rebel XTi. The only difference is that the effective focal length is slightly larger, so a 35mm lens on the Digital Rebel is the same as a 50mm lens on a film camera.There are a LOT of controls on this camera that make it easy to change film speed (up to ISO 1600), focus points, and other settings. I spent the first week playing with the camera so I can get used to making changes quickly. I also bought the book Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi/400D Digital Field Guide and read through it to learn more about the camera. This was MUCH better than just the user manual which came with the camera.The camera is FAST at taking pictures, even when using the flash. The flash is high enough that I see a lot less red-eye. I've tried using lower resolution settings and find that even the Medium setting produces super sharp pictures with lots of detail.The Digital Rebel goes into a low power mode when left on, and is ready to shoot as soon as you press the shutter release. I've left it on for more than 2 days and still find LOTS of power left in the battery. So far I've been able to leave the camera on and shoot over 300 pictures without running the battery down completely.If you're going to use this camera to shoot in Raw mode, you'll need a BIG memory card. I bought a Kingston 2GB CompactFlash Memory Card with the camera, fast and fairly large capacity. When I'm using Raw mode, the camera takes a Large format JPG picture together with the Raw one.

So you may want to consider the 4GB Kingston Compactflash Card.Colors from the shots are really nice with great skin tones, even when using the flash. The Rebel has a lot of different photo modes, but I'm mostly sticking with P where it chooses both aperture and shutter speed.

I've yet to miss a shot.-  Outstanding pics.  Pics with the EF28-105 good.  Pics with the EF 50mm, outstanding.  Many look like they were taken by a pro.  Trust me. I am no pro.  I'm a working mom looking for some good pics to put on their website and send to Grandma and Grandpa.  On average, with my point and shoot, I'd get 1 out 20 that were worthy of that.  Now, I average 5-6 out of 10 at a higher bar of course.-  Versitile.  I can play around with different settings and Canon lenses.  Fun but expensive.-  Battery charges fast.  Battery life outstanding.  I honestly don't think I've had to charge the batteries but 2-3 times since I bought it five months ago and have taken thousands of pics.-  The 4GB SD card keeps more pics than I could ever want.Cons.If you are a working kind of mom like I am and just want an awesome camera to take awesome pics, you've found it.  However, there is one big downside:  it's bigger...way bigger than a point and shoot.  It's not as easy to throw in your purse and go out for a splash day.  I have found myself leaving it behind because I just didn't want to lug it along with the diaper bag, a toddler and an infant...car seat, snacks, toys, bottles, wipes...etc.  The bag is heavy enough.  But, those pics are priceless as far as I am concerned and will sacrifice more often than not and find myself glad for having done so.LENSES.  This took me longer to figure out than which camera to buy.  I searched for a month before I committed.  Given the affordability of the 50mm and its reviews, I opted to do without the kit lens.Admittedly, I regretted it at first.  What!? No zoom.  As you can tell, I'm a serious amatuer and didn't know what I was getting into. But, despite the one time I wanted to take a group pic that required me to step clear to the other side of the house to get them in, 99% of the time, I'm trying to get a good close up of my kids...many pics by default at this age tend to be close ups.  Then, there is a subtle difference between the pictures I have taken with this lens and the 28-105--crisper, cleaner and outright beautiful color.The 28-105 is actually not bad especially if you use it with the hood.  The zoom is about what I figure I will need at ball games and ballerina recitals when I don't have to worry about lugging a diaper bag and keeping after a climbing/crawling baby.  For the price, I figure it's doable.There you have it, Amazon shopping Moms. I hope this Review was helpful.

I previously owned the Canon Powershot G2, and I think the Rebel XTi is the next step up the line.One observation for those used to framing the picture through the LCD, this is not the camera for you.  The Digital Rebel XTi requires you to frame the picture through the viewfinder.  I would recommend you do this regardless, but I know people that are confused (and even bothered) when they can't preview the picture in the LCD window.To really get your money's worth, I would recommend that you purchase a field guide or take a class.

I've taken in hiking, biking and backpacking, carried it in my pack, thrown said pack from moving vehicles, kept it in my backpack in below-freezing weather, taken it to the beach...

Yeah, that's about it.  Awesome camera!  I would highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Back in the SLR world", "Author": "M. Krenz", "ReviewID": "R3SWXXX49FT1SU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having been in the SLR world back in the 90s, I knew how much control you could have over your imagery, but I forgot just how great and fun it really is. Digital makes it even better.  I wanted to give a quick run down of things I really am happy about vs. a point and shoot camera and maybe that will help people make the dive into SLR. The XTi is a really great camera to take that dive with.Instant shutter release - I can't tell you how many good pictures I probably lost waiting for my Canon Digital Elph (had a SD110 and a SD700IS) to finally take the picture.  With the XTi, you press the button and it takes the picture right away.  In low light conditions, you might have to wait a second or two, but its still much faster.  And with the sports setting, you are more likely to get a sharp image when there is lots of motion. You can take that picture of someone hitting a baseball right when it makes contact.Multiple pictures per second - This is the frames per second rating. Not only does it take the picture fast, you can take a few pictures in a second.  This allows you to just hold down the shutter release button and snap away, allowing you to ensure that you get action shots at the right moment.  Recently I took my daughter to the zoo and took a picture of her feeding a giraffe. Because I was able to take multiple pictures per second, I was able to capture all the right moments of the event. I've actually taken this feature to the extreme by making some time lapse videos using 6000 frames of 4 fps pictures taken in 1.5 hours.Quality of image - The 2nd picture I ever took with this camera was one of the best pictures I've ever taken of my daughter. And I was just playing around.  Colors look better, lighting looks better.  Its not about megapixels, its about lens quality.Settings wheel - Having the wheel on top to control the settings of the camera is invaluable.  You can instantly change between a portrait shot and a sports shot, macro and landscape, etc.  On Point and shoot cameras, this often involves navigating a menu, which is time consuming and prevents or discourages you from taking certain types of pictures.Lens can be changed - This is probably the most obvious feature. You know those great close up pictures of birds, flowers, insects and stuff?  Those weren't taken with digital zoom, they used a real zoom lens.  The difference in quality is enormous and digital zoom is a poor substitute for having a real 300mm lens.  This camera doesn't come with a 300mm lens, but can buy a cheap 70mm-300mm Canon lens for a couple hundred dollars and take much better pictures than on any point and shoot camera.Accessories - There is a whole world of accessories that are geared towards SLR cameras, you really don't know it until you start looking.  So far I've bought a 70-300mm zoom lens, a UV filter, a polarizing filter, IR remote trigger and a remote timer.Some things to be mindful of:Get a UV protective filter to protect your lens. They are only like $10.The screen is not a viewfinder - I didn't realize this either until after I bought it, but I understand why this is the case, you want to be looking through the lens.  Honestly, this isn't as big of an issue as you might think it is.  You still get to review your pictures on the screen and there is lots of helpful information about your settings.Learn about photography - As great as this camera is, pictures still don't compose and take themselves, you should learn at least the basics of good photography.  You don't have to spend a fortune or take a lot of time either, you can just get a short and small book that explains things like depth of field, composition, etc.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Entry Level Digital SLR Keeps Getting Better", "Author": "Nuknuk", "ReviewID": "R16C0WQWEDIV8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The third generation XTi is the successor to the popular Rebel XT.

There you will appreciate the second battery.Good basic flash. The lens is good. Has no (IS) Image Stabilization but that doesn't seem to be a problem. The good news is that you can later improve the lens. I have shot with a friends Professional Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras and it works great. So improve the lens after you have a feel for the one it comes with which is enough for your average photo experience.The size is big compared with a point and shoot but it is smaller than all the other digital SLRs out there. So it is not a burden to carry it around.I love this camera. I use a SanDisk SDCFX3-4096-901 4 GB Extreme III CompactFlash Card (Retail Package) memory card.

Before the XTI, I was using the Panasonic-FZ18 but it just wasn't cutting it for me. I've read and own \"The Digital Photography Book Vol. 2\" and \"The Betterphoto Guide to Digital Photography\" so I know a little bit about photography and cameras. I've done quite a lot of research before making my purchase and I'm very please with my decision.Pros:- Great Price- Images are sharp and low noise at higher ISOs- Dust Removal System- 9 point AF system- 10MP- Picture styles- Good looking camera with good handling (It looks just like the XSI to me, except smaller lcd screen)Cons:- No Live View- Exposure is off all the time(In low light situation it underexposes and in bright situation it overexposes making the situation worst; this can be easily fixed by stopping at about -1 or +1 but I would still prefer to have the 0 be the right exposure for most of the time so that I don't have to take several shots to find the right exposure)- No image stabilization with kit lens (gonna need that tripod all the time until I get a new lens!)- Viewfinder is not that bright (not like the D80 or the XSI)- No spot metering- Auto mode is horrible (not that you should use it anyways!)- Auto and preset white balances are not so good eitherIn general this camera is pretty \"dumb\" and gets fooled pretty easily but if you like to set everything manually than it's not a problem. It's actually a plus if you're an amateur photographer because it forces you to get to know and utilizes many technical aspects of photography.Compare against other cameras?I didn't get a Nikon because the D80 cost too much (I would rather get the XSI). The D60 doesn't compare to the XTI (quality and features). I think the XT and the D40 are ancient by now. Sony and Olympus entry-level dslrs are packed with features and have good prices but the image quality is not quite as good as a Canon or Nikon. So in conclusion, for the price I think the XTI is an excellent choice for a beginner. But if I had some more money I would definitely go with the XSI. It pretty much solves all the problems that the XTI has and it also has 14-bit conversion which gives the image bit more detail and makes the gradients softer. I tested out the XSI at Best Buy and it's worth the extra money. I'm happy with the XTI for now, all the images I take are worlds apart from any point and shoot camera (like my Panasonic FZ-18 Super Zoom) and I'm only using the poor kit lens.

It weighs very little; hand-holding is very easy and comfortable.Boasting a plethora of configuration options including a mirror-up mode for macro shots, the Rebel produces extremely noise-free images all the way through ISO400.  ISO800 is entirely usable, but exhibits some noise.  Image quality is excellent; the large resolution means that you can crop your photos and still get 8x10 prints.Like all DSLRs, the XTi allows you to work directly with RAW files.  If you prefer, you can shoot in JPEG+RAW or just JPEG.  RAW files are about 10MB, so make sure to get a large memory card.  I can fit about 760 RAW shots on an 8GB card.  The camera makes intelligent decisions in its automatic or semi-automatic modes.  That said, my best shots have all been in aperture priority or full automatic mode.As a first foray into DSLR photography, this is an excellent buy.  Don't get it just for megapixels or to say you have a DSLR.  I used a Canon S3 IS for years with excellent results.  By no means do you need a DSLR to get high-quality images or flexibility.  Better image processing and interchangeable lenses are what set DSLRs apart from even prosumer point and shoots.

With film processing stores closing left and right, I was looking for a digital camera that would give me all the creative options of film, but wouldn't cost a fortune.  The rebel fills the bill nicely.  Complete control over ISO, white balance, saturation, sharpness and color temperature give me all the power I need to take the pictures I want.  10 megapixel resolution gives me better images than scanned slides, too.  The final straw was finding out that this camera has mirror lock-up, something my EOS-1 lacked.  I was sold.Canon really improved things over the last Rebel.  Controls are more intuitive, the 2.5 inch LCD is bright and clear, and the appearance is vastly improved.  The grip still needs to be bigger, but I bought the optional battery grip to solve that problem.  After installing the battery grip, I now would consider it a \"must have\" item.I hated the idea of going digital.  I was proud of being one of the few film users around here.

Glad I got this one.  Easy to use, lightweight, does everything a $1500 camera will do, except shoot fast on continuous.  Great shots, nice and clear, not a ton of distortion on higher ISOs.  The kit lens, although not horrible for landscapes and tight portraits, you'll want something else for low light, and action.  I recommend getting the kit lens for the D40, 28-135 USM IS, very nice and once you put that on, the XTi is a brand new camera.  I've heard of problems with shooting on continuous with flash.  Don't use the flash, I don't even know why they still tack these on SLRs, get a flash if you know you'll need it, you won't regret it.  Another issue is durability, of course they aren't going to make a $600 body as tough as the D40.  I recommend buying the MADE Camera Armor, nice product, helps with the durablility issue.  Right now this is a perfect camera to get me started in my studies and career.

I considered the Nikon SLR system - as well as the higher end Canons. Eventually the XTi won because of Canon's better upgrade path for lenses and camera bodies. I decided against purchasing the higher end Canon SLRs for now - after all the prices on those are likely to drop significantly over the next few years, which should give me much-needed time to improve my photography skills!I'll just say that the photographs you get with this camera can be amazing! The 9-point autofocus system is exceptionally useful. The controls are very easy and intuitive. I like to shoot in manual mode and end up changing ISO, white balance and exposure bracketing settings all the time. (On that note, I highly recommend reading a book on photography principles such as exposure. Bryan Peterson's \"Understanding exposure\" is excellent and will motivate you to outdo yourself.)The 2.5\" LCD display is excellent for reviewing and keeps me from making major mistakes as long as I look at it once in a while when composing my shots.I also like how light the camera is - makes it easier to use for travel. Some reviewers with \"large hands\" have complained about how the camera feels. I believe that if you are accustomed to using any point and shoot digitals, you will love this camera's weight and balance. However if your previous SLR was a large film camera you will have to seriously consider how the camera feels in your hands.As some reviewers have mentioned, any SLR camera will take some getting used to. It is inevitable that you will have situations where you thought you had that perfect shot but realized you forgot to change the ISO setting down from 1600 to 400 because your previous shot two hours ago was a fast stop-action. You can fix these problems by developing some type of start-up routine every time you switch on the camera. Just know that this is not the camera's fault - and don't blame the layout of the buttons.One word of caution before your purchase - if you are looking to photograph moving subjects indoors - like children, the low light performance could be a problem. This camera does not produce great shots at ISO 1600 or ISO 800 settings - so you will have to budget for a very fast lens like the 50mm/F1.4 or the 30/1.4(I am getting reasonable results with the 50mm/F1.8). Shooting with a lens that fast has its drawbacks - many of your photos will be out of focus if your kids are running around. (Whatever happens, please do not use flash to photograph kids in their element!)

My final solution was to download the manual from Canon as a PDF and then bring it up on my PC while I practiced with the camera. This worked. I discovered that the jpeg default settings are not as good as the Elph I have and love, but it doesn't matter. I still have the Elph and I use it at parties.For the purpose I acquired it, the XTi is perfect. I shoot everything in RAW and downconvert it to jpg with the software Canon provides.

For me, what makes the XT series better than the XS series is the use of CF memory cards in the XT series.  The XS series uses SD/SDHC memory cards which are a lot smaller.  The smaller card is nice because it helps save weight, but personally I prefer the larger cards (they are harder to lose).  The XTi DSLR is a great camera and coupled with the Canon 28-105mm USM standard telephoto lens you will have a fomridable combination of glass and body - you can't go wrong here.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "You'll never go back", "Author": "J.

I haven't picked the S2 up ever since. It's very easy to use, with a very small learning curve if your moving from an advanced point and shoot.Pros:-The camera shoots fast enough for me, 3fps is more than I need.-ISO to 800 is usable. 1600 is there if you have to use it but only in a no-flash dark environment where sharpness is critical. Trust me, the results can be used but you'll have to run the photos though noise ninja or something similar.-All of the settings are really easy to get to and change.-The 10.1 mp are more than enough to allow you to crop for mistakes you might make.-Depending on the lens, focus is scary fast and accurate. It'll make you never want to pick up that P @ S ever again.Cons:-No live view. This makes it tough for me to take shots with the camera close to the ground. With the Canon S2, I could twist the LCD and see what I was focusing on. There are accessories that allow you to see the viewfinder at an angle but they're expensive.-No Spot-meter-Dust reduction thing is really a gimmick more than it is usable I think. I still get some dust on the sensor I have to clean off from time to time that the dust feature won't shake off.-The body isn't the most comfortable to hold when you've got a long lens on. Pick up the battery grip to make this thing feel better in your hands.-The build quality is average. Don't expect an all-metal body for this price, most of the camera is plastic and there are no weather seals.Over-all for the price and the quality of the pictures I couldn't be more pleased with this camera. The #1 most important thing to me was picture quality and it never disappoints (except at ISO 1600). If you're on a budget and you don't have to have live-view, go with the XTI.

I looked online and saw this was a big problem with a lot of people, so I returned the camera and had a new one sent.  The new one is fine and works perfect.  Unfortunately, when I called Canon they denied the problem even though it's all over the web on every forum and review.  But hey, the new camera is fine....must have gotten one of the bad ones.

I was all set to buy the XT because at $[...] for the body it is great deal. But then I went to [...] and got my hands on the XTi body. The XTi is a beautiful camera and I really like the 9 point auto focus. But what changed my mind was the screen. I took a few test shots in the store and reviewed them on the brighter 2.5 inch LCD screen. It was then that I realized that I would be disappointed if I bought the XT with its smaller, dimmer LCD. If the XT had the bigger LCD I would buy it in a heart beat, but come on people! It's a digital camera and the whole point is to be able to review the picture you just took and actually be able to see it, even in bright sunlight. So for now I am stuck paying an extra $175 for the bigger screen, because I am not interested in the extra mega pixels. The dust shaking sensor and 9 point auto focus is welcome but not worth $[...].

[SLR stands for single lens reflex]. If u r just planning to use it as a point and shoot camera [in AUTO mode] plz dont waste ur money. Like all SLR cameras its bulky if u compare with slim-trim point-n-shoot cameras in the market which slide-in easily in ur pocket. There is no real time preview in the LCD at the back so u have to see through the eyepiece for framing the  photo. Its actually gives u the image as seen through the lens. Since, all light that enters the camera through the lens gets diverted  to the eyepiece via a mirror infront of the  sensor, we have no real time preview as no light falls on the sensors. Moreover there is a curtain [shutter] infront of the sensors [CCD type for canon]. Shutter controls the amount of light falling on the sensors. u can reach extremely fast sensor speeds like 1/4000 secs which gives u freezing image of moving objects. For night or astro photography one can keep the shutter open for as long as 30 secs. ISO range for the EOS 400D [rebel xti] is 100-1000, where 100 is the native sensitivity. For night mode one can increase the ISO but the picture is grainier or use flash [which fills the image with light n destroys the whole effect in the photo] or can decrease the sutter speed. At lower shutter speeds camera shake can blur the photo very badly, so one must use a tripod or use an IS [image stabilized] lens. The lens that comes with the camera [18-55 mm lens] is not very good and u cant expect more from a $50-75 lens. The canon has a vertical tilt sensor which rotates the image if u shoot it vertically. The re is a sensor which turns off the LCD in the front when u move ur eyes close to the eye-piece and this is really helpful. Imagine shooting in the night mode with something bright below ur eyes....it would be terrible. The kit aslo includes a battery n a charger esp made for the  EOS 400D camera. With fully charged it's sufficient for a full day of active photgraphy.The camera uses a CF [compact flash] card [normal cameras use SD or SDpro card]. Writing image to the card is fast. The camera takes a while if the card is full, to get ready to trasfer the image. I have used canon A630 and it gets ready very fast to trasfer the images to the computer.With this camera in continuous shooting mode one can shoot approx 3 images per second which u wont achieve with a normal digital camera. It has a maximum burst [total no. of photos one can shoot in the above mode] of approx 20 when there is no flash and image is small/fine jpeg. With RAW images it would be smaller.If I compare it with Sony Alpha series, Canon EOS 400D is clearly a winner. Sonys camera doest even look good. Compared to Nikon it has a body that is cheaper [$200-$250]. Nikon has more features that are more subtle and u might not use them. Nikon has one screen at the top of the cmaera when the data for various parameters like shutter speed, white balance, exposure, focus, ISO etc is shown. The LCD at the back is only for image preview. The canon's one LCD at back does it both, and i like that. Furthermore canon has only one dial to control compared to 2 in Nikon. Canon has an extremely good series of lenses too for all kinds of photgraphy.", "Date": "May 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Happy with camera.", "Author": "Filth and offscouring", "ReviewID": "R1RJ7EE03BP30A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my daughter, who is an aspiring photographer.

(He always used the lens, so I caved and bought a 2nd one - it's a great all-around.) We've used these bodies for nearly a year now.My husband has large hands, but he prefers the XTi body. I like the extra weight of the 40D, especially for a largish lens like the Canon 70-200mm L. The smaller XTi body fits better into holster bags. The off-on switch is easier to operate on the XTi - it sticks out, whereas the 40D's off-on switch is flatter to the body. The XTi's buttons and menus seem a bit more intuitive than the 40D, but has fewer options for people who like to fiddle with new things. I think the 40D battery lasts longer than the XTi, although that's an impression, not a scientific study.(For the record, I had a chance to shoot with the Sony Alpha A200. That body feels cheaper to me in its build. And I think the lens choices are much better for Canon and Nikon.)Looking at similar shots taken with identical lenses, it is very difficult to differentiate between the results. We are amateurs. My husband likes landscape mode, I like Av mode. One huge difference between these cameras is that the 40D has the ability to automatically set the ISO film speed in creative modes as well as point-and-shoot modes. When I'm using the XTi, I find it a pain to have to remember to check the ISO number and set it for conditions. For example, as it gets darker towards dusk, you might want to set the ISO to 400 rather than 100. (Remember: for both bodies, the ISO setting is automatic for basic modes like \"landscape,\" but I shoot mostly in Av mode.)Another interesting difference is the sky. When the XTi takes a picture of, say, a sunset in landscape mode, the sky is rich and red while the rest of the shoot is too dark. If I use landscape mode (or Av, for that matter) with the 40D, it adjusts things so that the sky is always washed out or white in order to make the rest of the shot visible. It often washes out a blue sky to white as well, even shooting Av mode at aperture 22. So if I want to get that sky color (at the expense of everything else too dark,) I have to point at sky only, press shutter halfway for exposure, and then recompose the shot. Then the picture turns out like the XTi. (I know, I know - probably need to buy a graduated neutral density filter, but I am so lazy and so cheap.)Something else to consider is that the accessories for these two cameras are not compatible. Although the CompactFlash cards are the same, the remote switch for the 40D doesn't work with the XTi, the batteries and chargers are not interchangeable, etc. This makes the pair less than perfect backups for one another, and more stuff to haul on a trip.For the price, I think the XTi is a better bargain than the 40D, although I suspect it's a lot like my brain: I'm only using the 40D at 18% of it's true capacity! Although I would still choose the 40D over the XTi, my husband prefers the XTi. For people who don't do weird things like reset the white balance or shoot in raw, the XTi is a superb choice - it's just an outstanding deal now that the prices have dropped even further. If you're not a real gadget nerd, I'd recommend buying the Xti, taking the money you save over the 40D and putting it towards a great lens.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Cool Camera", "Author": "Till E.

About a month after purchasing an Olympus 3030zoom Canon came out with the Rebel, needless to say I was just a little bummed out; I couldn't afford to get both. I was never completely satisfied because I couldn't use my various lenses so I would always take the EOS right along with my digital.  The 3030zoom takes incredible pictures, but I was still a 35mm junkie.I finally allowed myself to invest in this newer XTi about a month ago.  This camera is so easy to use, almost a point and shoot, the functions you need are very easy to access either from the wheel or the menu.  A lot of digitals are hard to operate because everything is buried in the menu, but you won't find that with the XTi. The pictures are FABULOUS!  I have 3 lenses from my EOS that are at the oldest about 19 years old and each and every one has worked with it.  One thing I would absolutely suggest to anyone who is purchasing, go to a store and put your hands on the cameras before you buy one.

I have owned digital point and shoot cameras by Nikon, canon and Pentax.  I have owned three different Pentax 35mm SLR cameras and this already out does them all.This review is not written by an expert photographer.  I am just writing about what I like and dislike and a few options to add to the camera to help the dislikes.Firstly, you can't beat the download speed and review of all pictures on your computer with a digital camera and the software included.  The editing software could be better but you can find better pretty easy online.Secondly, the lens it comes with is good and it works great for day to day use considering you will want others and this one you could bang up a little. If you are looking for a telephoto lens with macro then get the Tamron AF 70-300mm tele-macro on Amazon you can't beat its price and it takes some great shots.  The only downfall of the Canon is the EF and EF-S mounts that you can get from a few different retailers that are made for only the newer Canon cameras.  The downfall is unlike Pentax and Nikon where you can use almost all of their older SLR lenses for the digital SLR you have to buy new lenses for the canon.  But like I stated you can find lenses they are not in short supply.Thirdly, if you know nothing about using SLR this is a great teacher if you have the time to learn.  You can change the settings and review the shot so quickly that you can improve quickly.  The shooting options are as good as the old Pentax SLRs of the 70s and 80s and as good as the newer Pentax SLRs of the 90's. The direction book could be a little easier to follow as it makes you jump around a bit instead of flowing from one page to the next.Fourth, you need a tripod as your shots are not going to be as fuzzy as a point and shoot but the case itself feels cheap and fragile in your hands especially if you have big hands. Get the battery grip or a skin, not unlike the ipod rubber skins.Fifth, you can use the battery for about 2 hours straight, and I don't mean turning it on and off taking a shot or two an hour, I mean leaving it on and taking 20-40 multiple shots a minute.  I literally took shots in continuous mode for an hour and still had enough battery to use the flash for an hour.  I think I came out with 500 to 700 shots before the battery needed to be recharged, which took two hours. :(  Get an extra battery or the battery grip with two batteries and optional 6 AA battery cell.Sixth, the LCD screen is huge.  It shuts off when you get close to it to save your eye for focusing is low light but turns right back on when you back away and blinds you in the dark.  The fix is simple it shuts off, which is cool if you remember and saves the battery.  You also can review the picture taken for a few seconds by changing the display time which is nice or you can, like all point and shoots, press the play button and look at each shot.Among the negatives are the cheap feel of the casing and the flash options.  The flash is automatic in the green square automatic shot mode, whether you want it or not.  On the other hand you have an automatic setting that has the flash off too; it would be easier and quicker if the flash button changed that instead of dialing it in.  On the other hand the \"P\" setting is versatile.  You can shoot in almost any mode like the Automatic, you can change all settings and if you want it to flash you open the flash and if you don't you close it.Anyway have fun with it and upgrade when you learn more in this model.", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "I love this camera.", "Author": "Alan Es", "ReviewID": "R1YH5NGYBHUIH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

They knew of my plans to purchase it at sometime in the future, so it was exactly what I wanted!Years of experience with a Canon A-1, once the top-of-the-line in film SLRs, have taught me more than the basics of SLR photography.  Already owning a Canon Powershot digital camera, I have found it both easy and intuitive to understand and use the wide range of the XTi's exposure controls.  However, first-time digital SLR photographers may find the learning curve isn't quite so gentle, and the user's manual (for many digital cameras, including this one) oftentimes assumes more knowledge of camera functions and terminology than beginners may possess.There is one nuance I haven't quite mastered -- making sure the camera's shutter speed is matched to the effective focal length of the lens (to avoid \"camera shake\" blur).  And that's a problem with most digital SLRs, because the effective focal length of the lens of a digital SLR is actually larger than the true focal length.

So far I've taken some very good pictures of my family and of landscapes. Using the 'sports' mode, I was able to capture some very fast motion pictures, and they turned out very sharp and clear.I was also worried that my 1GB compact flash card would not be enough, but in large (highest quality JPG mode, the best quality besides RAW) I can get 180-200+ pictures on one card, and they transfer very fast every evening.The included strap is very comfortable, thick enough to not dig into the back of my neck, but light enough where it doesn't feel like I've got a noose around my neck.Once I registered the camera on Canon's website, I was sent an email with a 'private' support email address for Canon, which I have not (thankfully) had to use yet.

I have always loved that camera.I upgraded to the XTi body a little over a year ago and am very pleased with it.  It takes a great picture (if slightly grainy at high ISOs).The controls are intuitive and well placed.  Some of the more obscure ones took me a few minutes to find in the menu, but they're there.  As a landscape photographer, I particulary like the mirror lockup feature.  I missed that in the earlier Rebel body. (It was actually in the programming but disabled and there were some hacks available on the net to unlock it, but I was reluctant to void the warranty).Unlike the earlier Rebel body, the XTi is small.  Uncomfortably small.  To fix this, I bought the battery grip, which not only solves this problem, but also doubles the battery life, as well as adding another shutter release so that you can hold the camera \"normally\" when shooting vertical.  I highly recommend getting the battery grip. (The battery grip does not report the battery strength correctly though, but you can shoot for a very long time before the battery meter drops suddenly from 100% to 0%.  But that's not really an issue since the grip comes with an additional battery \"sled\" which takes AA batteries.  So that is an additional nice backup battery feature).The EF-S 18-55mm lens that comes in the kit is a great starter lens.  The focusing motor is nearly silent and the zoom range is ok.When purchasing additional lenses for this, I highly recommend getting the Image Stabilization (IS) lenses.

S3, S5 are great cameras but if I wanted to go beyond point-and-shoot in the future, I would have to purchase another camera.  It just made sense, economically to buy XTi right now.I have had this camera for a little less than a month now, and I am VERY happy with the purchase!For a SLR, Rebel XTi is much smaller, easier for me to handle since I'm a fairly petite person with smaller hands.

The only small negative is there is a delay if you stop taking pictures (almost no delay when taking several consecutive shots) while it writes to the memory card.

I spent about a year researching this camera the Nikon D40 (and D40x) but I eventually decided to go with this camera because I like how it fit in my hand a little better (it was that close of a call).This camera had a bit of a learning curve to figure out all of the buttons and their functions and shooting with a Digital Camera vs. a film camera is a little different (this lens doesn't have as large of an apperature range as my film camera, but too compensate for that all I can easily change the ISO setting.The Lens that came bundled with the camera is a decent one although I'm going to need to go out and buy a zoom lens soon.Just a quick summary:Pros:-Excellent picture quality-A very large and nice looking LCD screen-Has a full Auto setting as well as a program mode (set any fuction(s) (ISO, Shutter speed etc) and it will set everything else, and all the other modes shutter priority, aperture priorty, full manual, and Depth of Field Priority (haven't used this much)-The LCD screen shuts off automatically when you put your eye up to the viewfinder (and turns it on when you remove you eye) which doesn't seem exciting until you use a camera w/o this feature, as the glare from the screen can be very distractingCons:-Only comes with one rechargable battery and it can't use disposable batteries-The Settings screen is not as intuitive as I would like, but once I learn the abbrevations for everything it shouldn't be a problem (just plan on keeping the instruction manual handy for a few days)- My family doesn't like that you can't take a picture using the LCD screen on the back, which I think is a pro (since thats why I got an SLR) but if you're sharing the camera it could be an issue (The E-volt 420 (I think its by Olympus) is an SLR that will let you do this, but I don't think it fits very well in my hand.)Overall I think this is a great camera (esp for a budding amatuer) and I don't regret my purchase at all.", "Date": "December 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Kyle James \"Kyle James\"", "ReviewID": "R2V0E9VARBH48T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will first say this, I am not a professional photographer.

Yes it is a good camera, and yes it will satisfy most first time SLR users needs. BUT BE WARNED, if you are planing to get serious there are better choices out there! I originally stated that I was able to shoot a number of sports (soccer, hockey, rugby) with no trouble, and I still stand by that. However even a couple hundred more dollars will get you the 30D and in my opinion its a way better deal. Its not quite as easy to use button and menu wise, but thats something you can get used to! The AF is way faster and quieter, the increase in fps is a HUGE advantage for sports, the body feels great (maybe not for small hands) and is heavier which provides balance when hand holding L series telephoto such as the 70-200 f/4L. I just recently used the 30D with the 70-200 f/4L for a collegiate soccer game and let me tell you the difference was amazing. Compared to the xti and 70-200 the AF was way way faster. It made all the difference, and  a lot more of my shots came out useable. If you have the extra money I would highly recommend the 30D over the xti. Ultimately go hold them both, but the 30D just feels better and more solid. If your shooting an elementary school game the xti is great, but if your planning on doing anything semi serious the extra couple hundred is worth it. I give this camera four stars because I wont deny that it is a a good camera, however I leave out the fifth star because it lacks that extra kick of the 30D and obviously more expensive cameras.

Now that my children are getting more involved in sports and \"moving\" activities, I found that my old Sony DSCP93 camera (despite it's very nice pictures), was just not quick enough to capture these moments effectively. (Although I miss being able to just pop it into my pocket...)The silver body stays nice and cool during the hot days of summer in bright sunlight - which is the only advantage over the black body that I've found (that seems to be why all of the professional Canon-afficianado's prefer those white Canon lenses...). The presets for shooting makes the learning curve a little easier and helps aid in figuring out the intricacies of how to use the advanced features of this camera.

Canon may think it a good feature, quite often it focuses on the wrong thing. And even it focuses on the \"right\" thing, in most cases the image is not sharp. So I use the single point focus most of the time. But this gives me another problem. If I pick the non-center focus point, AE might not be accurate as the metering doesn't follow the AF point (I could be wrong on this). So in tricky condition I have to lock the AE first then reposition and shoot. Again this only happens in tricky situation. I'd say 90% of the time AE is ok.

It's perfectly workable, though, especially when a big lens is attached so I can grip it.  The control for shutter speed is easy to use, and there is a continuous exposure meter that shows how your aperture/ISO speed/shutter speed combination compares to the light levels.

The only thing I was disappointed was that it took a different battery, battery grip, and charger from my 300d.The biggest reason I upgraded was to get the bigger burst capacity but the better focus system, bigger screen, and of course added megapixels definately made it worth every penny of the upgrade. Another thing is that the body is smaller than the 300d which was smaller than the d30. I miss the heft of the d30 but plan to get the battery grip which will add some weight back to it. Its smaller size and lighter weight will probably be much better apreciated after I travel some with it.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon Rocks!", "Author": "Prashanth Ramachandra \"ramac\"", "ReviewID": "R3UHA4ZT5E6TI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am now using this camera for almost 2 months.

Although my title suggests this is best bet for beginners, this camera can be great for intermediate to semi-pro photographers with a limited budget.Pros- Relatively economic compared to other higher end Canon D-SLRs. Value for money. I purchased:- This camera (body only)- a 4 GB CF card- Canon 200dg Camera bag- Canon 50mm f1.8 lens- Extra battery for CanonAll this for a total of $690.- Excellent resolution pictures with a lot of detail.- LCD is larger and brighter.- The 9 point AF is fast, accurate and performs well in low light.- Settings are very easy to get to. For eg it is very easy and quick to change ISO and AF modes- Low noise as you go higher up in ISO modes. This is extremely important in low light situations where you want good pictures with less noise.Cons- The kit lens is disappointing. I purchased a Tamron 17-50mm instead and am extremely happy with the buy.- Sporadic shooting after buffer gets full when shooting in continuous mode. You will face this when shooting sport pictures. you have to know after how many shots the buffer gets full in order to not wait between taking pictures. It takes about 15-20 seconds for the camera to get back to normal once the buffer is full.- Same issue as above when using built-in flash. you will be able to shoot 4-6 pictures without any issue but then the flash will need to recharge and this again takes 15-20 seconds before you can start shooting again.- No spot metering. Not a big issue for beginners.- uses CF card. I am not a big fan of CF cards and that is why I put this as a con.- If there is data in the buffer and you open the CF card compartment, you will lose the data as it shuts off the camera.Overcall, the camera is great. Even with the Cons, the XTi is Canon's best selling D-SLR camera for the reasons I have listed above. Most important the value for money. One cannot go wrong with this camera.However, for those enthusiasts who are wanting to get into photography and are looking for a good D-SLR camera, should also look at Rebel XS. This is a model that is between the XTi and the XSi, with features from both the models and improvements from the XTi. It is priced well as well at $699 (less if you are able to find a good deal).I own the XTi and am extremely happy. This camera is the perfect way to begin photography. It can easily get you to semi-pro level after which you can start looking at other high end cameras. And the best thing is all the lenses you buy for the XTi, work with all Canon cameras (Note: there are exceptions, please make sure the lens you buy will work on Full Frame cameras).", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best digital SLR I have ever held.", "Author": "T.

Also, the lack of a rear-side control wheel and the unavailability of any ISO information in the viewfinder are drawbacks.Also, the hand grip is small, but not too small. I am using this camera with the rather heavy Canon 24-70/2.8L lens and it works, even though obviously not as well as with a more professional body.On a positive note, I had no problems with the infamous ERR 99 so far a software bug that frequently surfaced with the 10D, 20D, and 350D, although never with the 5D. If anyone is interested, just google for \"ERR 99\". This seems to have been finally resolved by Canon.The best thing about the camera is the build in sensor cleaning mechanism, which I often missed in the 5D. So far, the sensor is spotless.

Nice weight...I find it the best way of aproaching to reflex mode on a digital non-expensive gear.I guess it'll take me some time to really appreciate the lens-cleaning feature, but it seems to be very useful.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "CANON DIGITAL", "Author": "Coleen Klepenko \"photo girl\"", "ReviewID": "R15MEX3AFJ6V7U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loved my Christmas gift; still learning all the ins & outs but takes great photos & easy to use!", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon's Digital Rebel XTI's a great product", "Author": "Daniel Reiniger", "ReviewID": "R2JCAOMYSOGXRK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had mine for about 8 months.

The lense that it came with does not get great reviews - it's adequate - a bit soft, and not a lot of contrast. I added a Sigma zoom/macro lense, with which I've been very happy. After buying the camera, a second Canon lense wasn't in the budget. If you are an indoor available light photographer, I wouldn't count on this camera (or any DSLR, for that matter), but for most purposes, it's hard to beat. The high speed shoot with bracketing capability is a very nice feature. Nearly all the menus are understandable without reading the manual, which is refreshing for a modern piece of digital equipment. I drag the thing everywhere, and while I try to take care of my gear, it's gotten a bit of a beating, without any problems.

The grip size is easily fixed by adding the Canon battery grip, which will give you a larger grip and you will be able to shoot for a much longer time.  The lighter construction is also not that bad because you can carry it for a long time before the neck strap starts to dig into your neck.

I bought mine purely as a way to take pictures while on vacation and not risk my higher end Canon bodies and lenses.  My thinking was that if an accident happened or someone stole my camera, I would not lose as much in value.The lifespan of the shutter is problematic and I've probably shot a fifth of the number of shutter releases the camera is expected to have in the last four months. And, so far, no camera snatchers have made a go at it. I got the silver body just to make it look less professional.The big surprise for me is the camera's toughness. In my travels I have taken one hard spill where the camera went flying and, at another time, I accidently whipped the camera off my shoulder and sent it spinning away. Both times the camera hit the concrete hard.Each time, after picking up the camera with some worry that it had met its demise, I found that it worked the same as before.Now I should add that I had a Kirk Enterprises base plate mounted on the bottom of the camera and it shows the only scrapes that I can find, so it must have been the point of initial impact both times. That does not change the fact that the entire camera took hard shocks each time.

I don't want to go in length about the camera since I am also a novice user of DSLR Cameras. I did my research for Nikon and Canon using multiple websites and walking into local stores. Canon felt the most comfortable in my hands. I loved the quietness of it as well in a continuous shooting mode as well as how quick it is in a  single shot mode when taking really quick multiple shots. Picture quality is definitely exceptional and is most noticeable when picture is enlarged. It helps in editing when you can zoom in and crop to a subset of the main picture and still maintain a good quality picture with the subset picture enlarged. I didn't feel much difference in picture quality in small prints such as 4x6 but ability to shoot in various preset modes such as landscape and portrait and able to manually configure f-stop, aperture priority, shutter priority beats shooting with a pocket digital camera any day. On my trip to Las Vegas, I was able to make adjustments and take really good shot of fountains at Bellagio during day, sunset and night. I carried my pocket camera and shot with it as well but couldn't adjust much during difficult lighting situations. What I also love is the ability to zoom in and it's still pretty good with a 18-55mm lens. I was able to zoom in on the fountains as they were consistently changing during the choreography and take quick pictures. The pictures came out really good. I definitely would buy this camera again especially at the price it was listed, below $740. It is still an expensive camera but still the best camera you can find for that price and worth it if you want quality pictures.

Who even comes close to that??839 photos taken on 1 battery charge using built in flash for 60 of the shots.Fast accurate focus even in low light even with a long zoom lensHigh Image Quality even with kit lens when set at F8 / 28mmAccurate outdoor sunlight metering slightly biased towards dark which I like (easily over ridden).Absolute reliability so far even after carrying on motorcycle thousands of miles!Love the rear viewing screen for setting exposure.Cons:Slightly small to hold and control buttons on back are a little small.  Could be a plus for small hands but I have really large hands.Built in flash is very slow to recycle after a couple of shots (buy the Speedlite if you do much indoor flash)Inconsistent metering using flash indoors (most of this was caused by the kit lens, more below on this)Soft photos on standard setting (a lot of this was from the kit lens, you can over ride see comments below from 9-3-2007)Kits lens is really bad: its very soft at all settings, has high levels of chromatic aberration especially when using indoor flash, consistent under exposure by a 1/3 of a stop in sunlight, inconsistent exosure with flash, bad vignetting at 18mm, perspective distortion at 18mm.  Want to get ride of most of those problems?  I just borrowed a great lens that blows this one and most L lens into the weeds.  If you can get a good copy it's much much sharper and very low chromatic aberration.  It's the Sigma AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC macro.  Sigma seems to have some QC issues.Thoughts:I can not begin to tell you how many shots I missed at weddings with my old Konica Minolta Maxuum 5D camera because the auto focus would hunt, especially with a zoom lens indoors.I borrowed a friends 70 - 200 Canon lens and was amazed how fast this camera responds and is capable of focusing from minimum focus to infinity in what appeared to be less then 1 second!Speed:Using a Transcend 266X 8 GB card this new Rebel XTi ROCKS!!  My Rebel XTi would in sports mode consistently shoot 30 rapid frames in 10 seconds flat at Large High Quality JPEG before slowing down to store the buffer.Conclusion:This is an amazing camera for the price.  If you value fast focusing and shooting a lot of photos between battery charges this is the camera for you!  I went to the zoo this weekend and kept thinking the battery was going to run dry, it didn't run down until I had taken 1,800 photos!!!  I woudl have had to have 3 batteries with me to do that with my old camera.-------------------------------------------------------------Update:7-8-2007I have taken over 5,000 photos (5,934 to be exact) with this camera now and can tell you the following:Pros:Amazing battery life as much as 1,800 photos JPEG no review at ISO 100Amazing photos outside in daylight even using the kit lens at F8 or above.Amazing auto-focus anywhere anytime, day / night inside our out.Cons:Terrible Flash photography:  (Update 929-2007 most of this was caused by the kit lens) The flash exposure is consistently poor. It changes from shot to shot even shooting the same subject with the same lens in the same light.  It can very from shot-to-shot of the same subject, it doesn't seem to know if the subject is too light or too dark.  And that's even using the Canon Speedlite 430EX flash!!  To top if off when I review the shots on the cameras screen the exposure ususally looks fine, then when I get back to my computer it looks under exposed.  The best settings I have found for flash is either to use the full program mode, or use Manual Mode at 1/200th F8 with one third stop + flash compensation.If you are trying to use the built in flash the camera locks up and displays a busy light so the flash can recharge and it has even worse results then using the Speedlite.No auto ISO:  I love this feature but the Canon Rebel XTi only has it in the full automatic mode.Conclusion:  If you are an outdoor action photographer you can't go wrong, this camera is amazing.  However if you require indoor shots using flash you may want to look elsewhere.For this reason if I could I would change my rating to 4 stars.---------------------------------------------------------Update:7-9-2007Called Canon tech support about the Flash photography settings and they were very helpfull.After several trial and error settings we came up with the following settings that seem to be consistent and work well when using the Speedlite 430EX flash and kit lensPeople photography use Manual Mode at 1/320th F5.6 with one third stop + flash compensation ISO 400 H Speed Flash Sync Mode 24mm zoom manually set.Macro photography use Manual Mode at 1/320th F11+ with one third stop + flash compensation ISO 400 H Speed Flash Sync Mode 24mm zoom manually set.Update:7-24-2007Flash Photography fix:Well at least it works better it's not perfect but it helps.1. Set the Canon Speedlite 430EX Flash to High Speed Sync.2. Go to manual mode and set the shutter speed to 1/250 or higher at F8.3. Try different speeds with the shutter to get the effect you want and watch the meter if you are using fill flash in daylight as you will have to compensate manually.  I have found 1/500th at F8 or higher to work really good for close-up photos and Macro work at ISO 100.  Just watch your distance because this setting takes a lot of flash power.9-1-2007Still love this camera I'm at 10,867 shots now.Have found this camera is great for taking on a trip as it's so small you can put it into a car center console and reach for it to take quick shots on the road.Plus my wife loves the small size which she says fits her hands perfectly.9-3-2007Have fallen in love with the Picture Styles.I'm using a modified settings for Standard mode and have set it for sharpness of +7 Saturaton +2.  This givess me JPEG photos that are sharp and full of color right out of the camera.9-20-2007How to take rich super sharp photos with the Canon Rebel XTi.These are the types of photos I thought the camera should be taking in the first place.This worked for me your results may vary.  Test these settings out before you shoot anything important.  Set the camera for both large JPEG and Raw if you are in doubt as the settings below only effect the JPEG and not Raw files.From trial and error I found the following steps really work to make rich super sharp photos.1.  Go into Picture Styles and select the style you will be using.2.  Change the Sharpness to maximum.3.  Change the color saturation to +2.4.  Set the camera to produce Large JPEGs.5.  Put on a lens known to be sharp. I found through trial and error testing of many Canon L lens and after market lens the sharpest lens I have ever usedis a Sigma Zoom Super Wide Angle AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC Macro Autofocus Lens.  My Canon 50mm F1.8 stopped down to 5.6 is sharp as well but not as sharp as that Sigma.6.  Put your camera on Program mode and an ISO between 100 - 400 go outside and have fun.For inside flash photos1.  Set settings as above.2.  Put on a good quality lens like Sigma Zoom Super Wide Angle AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC Macro Autofocus Lens or Canon 17-40L etc.3.  Attach and turn on Canon 430EX Speedlite.4.  If that's not sharp enough set the camera for high speed flash sync and put camera in manual mode with shutter to 1/320 second and F5.6.9-29-2007 11,900 photos takenI just bought a new lens for my Rebel since the kit lens is so bad (See new comments above in Cons) It's much much sharper and has very low chromatic aberration.  And as a bonus it opens up a little wider 17 vs 18mm and zooms out further 70mm vs 55.  It's the Sigma AF 17-70mm f/2.8-4.5 DC macro.  It's my new walk around lens stays on my camera at least 60% of the time now.11-16-2007 13,112 photos taken.Have been busy doing other things but I'm sure will be taking lot's of photos during the holidays.  One thing I have noticed is if the battery strength is down to 2 bars or less (I.E. not full strength) some of my lens will not auto focus accurately.  The worst lens about this is my Canon 135mm F/2 and the next worst is my Canon 70-200 F/2.8 L zoom.  The 135 will miss focus and the 70-200 will hunt more often.  A simple swap out with a fresh battery always solves this.3-28-2008I recently purchased a new Canon 40D.  I haven't touched my Canon Rebel XTi since.  The 40D is THAT much better.  I keep the Rebel now as a backup.  The Rebel now has just over 20,000 photos taken.4-7-2008 Focus test update.  As a test of auto focus power I tried the Canon 85mm F/1.2 L II Lens (this lens will push your auto focus to the limit even with the USM) with the Canon Rebel XTi and Canon 40D back to back. Talk about over taxing the system! I thought this lens was slow to focus on the 40D. The 40D will focus from minimum distance to infinity in a second or so with this lens (all other USM lens faster then I can even time or think). The Rebel takes what seems like an eternity to focus through the limits with the 85mm F/1.2 L II or well over 2 seconds. The funny part is how unbalanced this combo feels the Rebel XTi is this little camera body hanging off the back of the lens. Still in the end the Rebel does focus and you can use it even though you have less shots in focus then with the 40D.  So I'm thinking most people that can afford this lens will be buying at least a 40D or higher but you can go for it if you get the chance.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Glenn G. \"pcguru\"", "ReviewID": "R122FO2I3QT1OP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera works fantastic.

I was impressed with all of the features and ease of use. However, after shooting around 200 pics with nearly all of them being underexposed, I have decided to return the camera. Most of my pictures were underexposed by 2/3 to 1 stop, and yes I know that I can easily use exposure or flash compensation, but after spending nearly $800 I figure the camera should shoot well without me having to do that. The underexposure makes the full auto mode completely useless, therefore none of my family would be able to use the camera.

It was time to move to digital however and I just couldn't justify the cost of the 10mega-pixel EOS, so I opted to \"step-down\" to the Digital Rebel XTi.After taking my existing ultrasonic lenses to a local retailer and making sure they'd work on the Rebel XTi, I purchased a \"body only\" version of the camera, thus saving myself roughly $50 dollars.I've been using the camera for a few days now, mostly in the house and I'm happy to say that I think I made the right decision. Only a real die-hard photographer will lament the loss of some of the finer configurations available on the full EOS. For me, and for most people, the Rebel XTi has everything you need. It still includes your standard modes: Landscape, Sport, Twilight, etc., and of course you can adjust aperture and all that other stuff that only people who do it as a profession or hobby really understand anyway.The built-in flash is very powerful, moreso I'd say than what was on my EOS 35mm, and the menu is more intuitive than the Fuji FinePix I had before purchasing this camera.Additionally, some have noted that any 35mm lens you try to use on the digital will creating some cropping, but I don't really see a difference. I probably would if I could put the two side x side, but my standard wide-angle lens takes in a fair amount of space, and my zoom lens appears fine too. For reference I have the Ultrasonic lenses with the red dot, not the ones with the red dot and white square.Cons: You can't view what you're taking a picture of in the viewfinder; you have to look through the lens. Also, the carry strap that comes with it is pretty cheap. I'll probably use the one from my EOS.My particular purchase included everything BUT a CF card, so I got a 2GB one from Transcend ($45), and it works perfectly.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and I don't feel like I missed out on any features by not buying the EOS.", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best entry level SLR hands down!!!!!!!", "Author": "D.

So much so that when Pop Photo first reviewed it, they essentially said that it was the most advanced 35mm SLR camera they'd ever reviewed to that point in time.  Buying the Rebel XIi many years later took no great leap of faith.  BUT, I first had to be convinced that the noise level (or the equivalent of the graininess in film) would be extremely low in those areas where it is most apt to rear its ugly head -- nighttime photography, photos with dark backgrounds, underexposed photos.  To make a long story short, I was astounded at the lack of noise.  I tried my darndest to make noise appear, and about the best I could do was equivalent to shooting today's high-quality ISO 800 speed film in moderate to ample light.

I felt I had to replace it because a small plastic piece inside broke that ultimately knocked out the autofocus. Design flaw, if you ask me, and one that I really hope this new model doesn't share. Anyway, to the new camera--I definitely like the feel overall, although it is certainly different than the original (smaller). It seems a bit speedier, particularly from powering up to first picture, and I really like the shutter sound, which sounds very high-end--or at least more so than the original.The picture quality is excellent, and is equal to or better than the original except for a very tiny bit of underexposure, which I've come to believe is intended by Canon to help prevent excessive blown-out highlights. I do a fair amount of post-processing, so that doesn't bother me. I can always compensate a bit in dark scenes when shooting, if necessary.I am having a bit of trouble adjusting to the new interface, paricularly ISO adjustment. Previously, I would select the ISO button to change the ISO, make the change with the main dial, and then press the ISO button again to get out of that mode. The XTi behaves differently, in that if I do that same series of actions, I end up changing the ISO to a different setting than I want, because pressing the ISO button to \"get out of that mode\" no longer does that. When in that mode, that button acts as an arrow button, and changes the setting. So anyway, that's just something I going to have to adjust to.It is nice that the black body matches my lenses better than the original did, and the camera just looks and feels more professional, which is good. I wasn't quite ready to upgrade to this model, because it's not quite enough of an upgrade for me personally (I really woud like a full-frame model, with none of the 1.6x business), but because I use this camera for work, and because I have an investment in lenses, I felt compelled to.

Not enough to give an impression on the quality of the pictures. Many things have improved. Most important the responsiveness of the camera. I only want to give an advice about two things that to me are definitly much worse that the 300D I had before.The main one is the size of the grip, which is much smaller. If I use heavy lenses, 5 minutes are enough to start feeling my hand hurt. Had I had the camera in my hands before buying, this reason would have been enough for me to go definitly for the 30D.Second one, less important: they have reduced the size of the battery. Now battery lasts less, maybe because the cell capacity has decreased, or maybe because the display now has to stay on much longer than it used on the 300D. I used my 300D battery charger also for my Canon MVX3i camcorder batteries. Now I cannot do that anymore.

My first SLR was a Rebel 2000 so I am very familiar with all the normal features as well as the new features of this camera.  I also own a 5MP Canon A95 Power shot which blows the XTi out of the water on almost any indoor shot.  The flash is never enough - as one review said, almost all low light (in door) shots will come out dark.  The foreground will be OK but there will be no background detail.  Contrasting this with my Powershot, the same exact photo will have a nice bright background.  I have taken hundreds of comparison shots to a friend of mine's XTi as well as comparing to my Powershot.  The \"new nine zone\" focus does not work well either, I have to use center focus mode and be sure of what it is focusing on.  My Rebel 2000 film camera almost never a focus issue.  Unfortunately, it seems Canon just didn't put the quality into this one.  The only way I have found to get a better picture is to go into manual and push the flash up one stop, but for $800, I shouldn't have to do this.

It is very similar in layout to my Rebel Ti film camera, which I've been happy with and already have a couple of lenses for, so I decided to stick with Canon for a DSLR (and as another bonus, it has the same battery as my Canon camcorder so I already have a spare battery).  The body, while plastic, seems pretty rugged and looks good--much less glossy than my lenses.  I also like the relatively small size as it's easier to lug around, and fits well in my hand with the pinky curled under the bottom.  It's a wee bit thicker and taller than the Ti, but shorter on the left side because it doesn't need to hold a can of film.Rather than get the cheap 18-55 kit lens, since I already had the 35-80 kit lens from an even older film Rebel, I ordered a nice Sigma 18-50 f/2.8 Macro lens.Best of all, I ordered this Wednesday morning and Amazon shipped it from Los Angeles the next day and UPS delivered here (San Diego) on Friday.  I paid an extra $8 for standard shipping because Amazon was out of stock on the Sigma lens, which I instead ordered from 47th St through Amazon and had no choice but to pay $15 for \"standard\" shipping, and I didn't want to get the lens without a camera.  Well, I'm still waiting for the lens a week after the camera arrived.  Even though the total price was $6 less than the Amazon price with free shipping, I would have rather used Amazon because of the better return policy.  And I think that still would have beaten the slow boat from New York.The only problem with the shipping on these expensive items is that UPS requires a signature--so it actually took a few extra days to get my hands on it since nobody happened to be home.  A better bet would have been to ship it to my workplace.And--Amazon has dropped the price by $20, and 47th dropped shipping charges by $10, since I ordered.

I also spend more time editing the pictures than I do taking them.  I love the outdoors and traveling.  I take my camera everywhere.  So, you can imagine how really excited I was about moving up to an SLR body camera and all the advantages that it could give me.  Unfortunately, it turned out that it took every ounce of joy out of taking pictures for me. For starters, I am too stupid to get it to work well!  There is no doubt this is a fine camera.  In the hands of someone who knew what they were doing and were willing to spend the time, it will perform very well.  However, for a hack like myself, I could only get about 40% of my shot on autopilot to looked really good.  I don't know where it was focusing but even with all the help on board it only got part of it right.  There where some really outstanding pictures compared to my old camera but I couldn't tell when it was going to work.  In low light there was no hope.  There was nothing I could do to hold it still enough to get a clear shot.  I had it wedged up against a concrete building and low wall trying to take a picture of Austin's skyline at night.  I even added my tripod for more support and it still didn't work.  Which bring me to another fact of life with these cameras.  They are very expensive.  The image stabilization cost more than the camera and that is just the start!  It looked to me that I would have at least $3,000 invested into this thing to get it to do what I wanted!  That is an awful lot of money for very little return when comparing these cameras to the cheaper easier to use models.Then there is the size of the thing.  When you add in all the goodies that go with it you have a massive bundle of stuff that is not only heavy, it is pretty large.  I can't see any real reason for all of this given the new advances photography.  I spent all my time messing with the camera and lugging stuff around instead of enjoying myself and having fun.

The camera requires 10 - 15 seconds to \"recharge\" between shots.  It displays \"busy\" in the viewfinder, just to remind you how long it's taking.

The lens that comes with it is OK but it doesnt zoom & you cant take up-close photos, the camera will NOT let you, it just turns black, so be prepared to spend spend spend!!

Our Canon review panel have tested every function, every mode and evey setting of the Canon Digital Rebel XTi in the hope that we could provide you with a balanced and objective review, yet to our frustration all we came up with is that the Digital Rebel XTi is a very similar but much better quality camera than the Digital Rebel XT. Although despite its modest dimensions, Canon has stuck with the traditional Compact Flash memory card format for the XTi model.You won't be shocked to find that Digital Rebel XTi features an oversized 2.5 inch screen & boasts Canon's Picture Styles function. The XTi also inherited the previous Canon 30D's nine-point AF system. However, instead of using the proven 8 MP sensor found in its predecessor, the XT model, Canon has this time developed a fa superior 10.1 MP CMOS sensor! This makes the Digital Rebel XTi the highest resolution D-SLR camera with an EF-S lens mount to date!The advanced features make the Canon XTi a significantly better upgraded model than was expected, also placing Canon's entry-level D-SLR above its own higher end EOS 30D! So, we happily award the new EOS 400D a '5 Star' rating and believe it's a feasible competitor to Sony's new 'Alpha 100'. The Xti is certainly a hot addition to the Canon 'Digital Rebel' SLR range.

If you're still interested afterwards, THEN read the other reviews.  If I'd read this review, I might not have bought this camera.I chose the XTi because although I'm by no means a professional photographer, I wanted a good solid camera that would take great pictures easily straight out of the box, yet not limit me if I decided later to get fancy and buy upgrades, better lenses, accessories, etc.  The reviews I read here overwhelmingly sang the XTi's praises.  One of the features I was most excited about was the ability to take lots of pictures in very quick sucession.Which is true, it does.  This is probably my favorite thing about the camera.  But I ran into a problem almost immediately.I take a lot of indoor shots, one after the other, and this camera's built-in flash JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT.  It will let me take about 20 in a row, practically as fast as I can push the button, but after twenty I'm forced to wait a little over 10 seconds between shots.  And that seems even longer when you're missing great shots while waiting for the 'busy' display to turn off.  If I let the camera rest a few minutes, sometimes it's kind enough to give me four or five more fast shots in a row, but then the ten-second delay comes right back.I find this very hard to understand...it's NOT a battery issue.  The lithium battery that comes with it seems great to me, I don't think I've ever seen it drop below 'full' no matter how many pictures I've taken.  Besides that, if it were a question of the flash recharging, the time between shots would GRADUALLY lengthen, rather than going from 20 superfast shots to an immediate ten second delay.  Anyway, I tried switching to a fully charged battery and it didn't make any difference.After further investigation, it says right in the instruction manual that \"if you shoot 20 images with flash at short intervals, the flash might stop operating.  This is to protect the flash unit.\"  So this is apparently an overzealous safety feature.  This is the kind of thing that should be printed in red letters on the box before you buy the camera, not a fun surprise you find buried on page 54 of the camera's manual after you've got it home.-----There's another problem which I knew about going in, but I didn't realize how much I'd miss it until I didn't have it anymore.  My old camera had the fairly obvious benefit of being able to preview the viewfinder on the LCD screen, so that you didn't always have to have the camera up to your face to take a picture.  This is a fairly standard feature on digital cameras, I'd say...nearly universal.  Makes tripod shots easier.  But the Canon does not allow you to do this...every shot you take will have to be through the viewfinder.  The Canon has a nice 2\u00bd\" screen, but by not allowing you to set up shots through it, it's kind of wasted.  After taking a few hundred shots I tend to have double vision for hours after peering through the viewfinder for every shot.-----So.  To sum up.If taking lots of fast indoor shots is important to you, then either go on to the next camera, or include the cost of an external flash in your price comparison.  Likewise, if you've used the LCD preview feature on digital cameras previously, note that it is not an option on this camera, and you will miss it.I don't have any experience with other comparable cameras, but you might look into a Nikon D80...I did a quick search for the word \"flash\" in its reviews and found no complaints about delays.  It may be $1000, but if the Canon's slow flash would require you to buy a flash unit ANYWAY, then they're nearly the same price.  Plus the D80 comes with an 18-135mm lens, compared to the Canon's 18-55, so overall the D80 might be a better deal despite the higher price.Anyone want to buy a slightly used Canon XTi?", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "wanted one for S/D cards!!", "Author": "Nana 12x's", "ReviewID": "R2D5R3R1DV1XFQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well, I really was starting to like this one until I saw it uses Compact Flash.
