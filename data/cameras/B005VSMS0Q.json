{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works very well.", "Author": "Yukon", "ReviewID": "ROHCE2UN7ZIUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gotta say, this box works very well.  Its full color, full motion.  Video loop thru on the 4 video inputs.  Haven't noticed any distortion or or anything.  The quad views are all full motion full color.  Outputs to a VGA monitor and/or video monitor.  You can label your cameras for the monitor view, doesn't affect the loop thru video.  For a low $100 range box, its actually kind of incredible.  There's a 5th input that, although isn't used by the quad views, it acts as an input which is immediate send to the VGA/Monitor output.  Its not part of the normal sequence of cameras, but selecting brings the video full screen immediately.  Useful if you connect it to a device that is recording your cameras to replay that video, or for a 5th video that you want to look at occasionally.This box is intended for security cameras, but i'm using it as a preview bus for cameras for my video switcher.  Cameras plug into this box, and the outputs feed the switcher.  Single VGA (or video) monitor does a quad display and lets me preview all the cameras on a single monitor.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005VSMS0Q"}}
