The actual quality of the pictures are great. My main complaint is that you're lucky if the pictures don't turn out blurry. I always end up putting it on Fast-moving Subjects mode. Then the pictures usually turn up good. The only time this really bothers me is if a room is dark and I need to take a picture in night mode. Then it either turns out bright and blurry or dark.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cute at first", "Author": "Lorraine C. \"LoCo\"", "ReviewID": "R192QPF1HFQHUS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from Walmart over a year ago and it has been great up until lately.  I'm not sure if it is a battery problem, but I'll know more once I get the battery that I ordered.

Of course, the Walmart warranty was only for 30 days, so we're out of luck.  This is the second Sanyo camera which we had purchased for her and the first Sanyo (VPC-S880) also stopped working after about a year and a half.  We will not ever purchase another Sanyo camera, they are garbage.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "the camara doen not have a little spot. it is totally blind", "Author": "eder apolinar castro pelayo", "ReviewID": "RTMXLS9GPZMKP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the camara doen not have a little spot. it is totally blind. the user do not specify that in its descritption", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Barbara Trivitt", "ReviewID": "R2MCLW05UIZ2Z1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I see most of the reviews on here are terrible.

My requirement for camera is very low. Basically, I just want to have a small camera that can take photos with no blurry, and that was it. I do not zoom it or anything, but the camera just does not work at all. So I rarely use it, but it still broke, without me even touch it... Surprising, it broke right after the 3 month warranty. I turn it on, and the lens start to make a weird noise, come in and out, and the screen shows a line saying \"system error.\" and it turned off by itself. I did research about that online, and it seems to be an issue to all Sayon cameras. I am taking Industrial design major, and I have been taught in school that there are some evil companies try to make their products unsustainable, so that you can keep buying their product; Sayon is surely one of them.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "14 Megapixels\n28mm Wide Angle Lens\n4x Optical Zoom\n720 HD Video\n3 inch 16:9 LCD screen", "Name": "Blue Sanyo VPC-X1400 14mp Digital Camera with Wide Angle 4x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AyzTBuE-L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0042L66N8"}}
