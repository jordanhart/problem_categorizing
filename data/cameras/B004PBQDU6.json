{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrific Canon T3i bundled package - best deal!", "Author": "calyxxa \"calyxxa\"", "ReviewID": "RU5D0HBDH1QGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally pulled the trigger on purchasing my first DSLR camera.  I wanted the Canon T3i plus I wanted both the standard lens and a zoom lens.  I came across this great packaged deal from Cameta Camera.  I was a little hesitant because I was not familiar with this Amazon merchant, but the reviews on this seller were very positive, and this deal was the best I found on the internet.  I wasn't really looking for accessories, but Cameta throws in so many accessories - really, I have everything I need to start...filters, flash, extra battery, memory card, card reader, card holder, camera bag, cleaning kit, screen protectors...I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  Plus, it comes with both the 18-55 IS II Lens and the 55-250 IS zoom lens in addition to the Canon T3i body.  I priced these items on various different websites, including ala carte here on Amazon, and Cameta offered the best deal hands down.  While shipping is expensive ($18) - compared to $0 with Amazon Prime which doesn't apply to this buy, the overall price is still less than other sellers.  I received my shipment in less than a week.  Although I haven't had any problems and haven't needed to reach out to Cameta Camera for customer service, so far, I'm very happy with this purchase and with Cameta.I ensured my camera and lenses thru Square Trade's 3 year warranty, and I've been pretty pleased so far with Square Trade, too.  Very easy to purchase and get registered.Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18.0 MP Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens with 55-250mm IS Lens + 16GB Card + Battery + Case + (2) Filters + Flash + Cleaning Kit", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Except Bag everything is very GOOD but no extra flash as displayed in Ad", "Author": "Sri", "ReviewID": "R20LB2NZVUKDUC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Except Bag everything is very GOOD .No flash (but displayed in the photo)I got this bundle on right date and one day early also .Canon body cam made in japan .canon 18-55 mm lens made in TaiwanCanon 55-250 made in malaysiabelt strap, canon battery ,canon battery charger ,extra 2000 power battery ,remaining accessories mentioned in Photo . i felt happy about the itemsOnly one thing is not comfortable is the bag its very low quality and not comfortable for carrying and shooting .i would recommed to buy this product from cost point of viewbecause outside its (850 (canon body & 18-55 lens kit) + 150 (55-250mm lens) $ ) = 1000$I paid altogethe 1018$ ,which included all other accessories bag ,cleaning items except flash", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Technical Wonder", "Author": "DMc \"dam\"", "ReviewID": "R3IRPYRAYEP7X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have not used a SLR camera since the 80's. Since then I've stumbled through multiple compact cameras promising great results only to be let down when special conditions arose. So far the T3i has not let me down. The flash that came with the kit is very simple, and except for bounce-flashes, the built-in flash allows more flexibility and is preferred. The other components of the kit are very useful and of good quality. Of course my total expenditure is much greater than that of any compact, but I guess you get what you pay for, and the price is well worth it to me. I might also take the opportunity to push David Busch's guide book on the T3i. It will greatly improve your enjoyment of the T3i and justify the expense. It will even give you insight into using a wireless flash which is why I made a Speedlite my second purchase. With it, anything is possible it seems. I definitely recommend the camera kit as well as the two other items I purchased.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "very happy", "Author": "sherri", "ReviewID": "R14VDXLD8D4OFU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was in the market for an entry level SLR to get back into photography.  Last time I had a decent camera it used 35mm film.  I took some time looking at different brands and decided on the Canon.  Then I spent some time looking at prices and packages.  I am very happy with the camera and two lenses.  The extras in this bundle are ok.  Generic flash, generic extra battery etc...but good to have in a pinch.  I wanted something I could grow with as my skills come back.  So far I've taken some great photos while boating and watching my kids sporting events.  I agree with the other person's feedback on the case.  Nothing special there, however I am using it as a storage case for the items I don't want to carry with me everyday and bought myself a photo backpack to go.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS T3i SLR", "Author": "Merlot Rider", "ReviewID": "R1BOPQ59MZR6MT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had the camera a short time with limited use but I am very happy with this product.

I would highly recommend it to anyone upgrading from a Point & Shoot camera.  My #1 advice is get away from shooting with \"auto\" and find out what these DSLR's are capable of producing.  16GB SDHC Card, SD card reader, and filters all work great.  I haven't used any of the other extras yet.  The bag doesn't seem to be the best quality but I'm just using it for storing things I'm not needing at the moment (owner's manuals, flash, cleaning kit, etc.).  I bought a Lowepro Slingshot Bag instead (spend a little extra and get a bigger size than what you think you will need).

And the price is really great. There are not so many differences from the T4i and T5i models (only if you really like touchscreen).All of the bundle items came, no exception, but some of them don't match the picture or the ones in the description: the SD card reader, the bag and the flash, i.e.. Although I haven't tested the flash yet and I know that the SD card reader works really well, the bag is just awful. It's made by Zeiko's and not precision design, there's only one compartment for everything and the handle on the top also pulls up all the lid when you carry it so if the lock breaks or loosen up when you're in the middle of the street, your camera will probably hit the ground hard. So be careful with that bag.Other than that, it's really a great purchase. I'm in love with what this camera does. Easy to operate, very sharp pictures.I really recommend it to people who are starting/intermediate.

It arrived two days before estimated arrival. The kit contained everything advertised.  The Canon products are great. My first Canon was the AE-1, which I got in 1977. I also have a Nikon 35mm camera. This is my first DSLR and I do have a learning curve to conquer. I have kids in sports; my pocket digital just doesn't cut it and my 35mm film cameras are-- well you know the limitations. I will also use the new camera for portrait, still, and outdoor/nature shots. First impressions: \"Wow! I look forward to using it. And it's light weight.\" I am considerably beyond \"point and shoot,\" however, I have a feeling that I may never tap into all the finesse/professional bells and whistles that the T3i offers. WARNING: the Precision Design DSLR300 High Power Auto Flash will NOT work with the T3i's automatic features- it's just a flash. There's not a place to attach the sync cable to the camera that came with the flash. What's even stranger is that the instructions with the flash said that the cable is not necessary for use and never provided instructions on when or why it might be used. I know my AE-1 has a flash cable port, but I've always used the Canon AE flash with the connectors on the hot shoe. I'm not sure I'll use the Precision flash much. This was kind of a disappointment, but Cameta Camera delivered what they advertised and I got what I ordered. Can't complain.  I like the Vivitar UV filters.  Other reviews I read said the carrying case was weak, but it's OK for my needs. I have other bags I can swap if needed.  I think a wireless remote would have been a better addition to the kit than the flash, but we'll see.  Additional purchases: 58mm Rubber Lens Hood for Canon Rebel and Fotodiox Eye Cup Eyecup for Canon EOS Digital Rebel (I'm not sure this was a good idea- it's not an easy swap. But I've spent more time learning the camera than wrestling with the eyecup).  Possible future purchases: the remote, Canon Speedlight Flash, & maybe a polarizer filter.  I will submit another review after a few months and reasonable use.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$729.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\nCanon EOS Rebel T3i Digital SLR Camera Body; EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens + Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS Lens + Transcend 16GB Class10 SD Card +\nSpare LP-E8 Battery + Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter + Additional Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter +\nPD Digital SLR Camera Case + Precision Design DSLR300 Flash + LCD Monitor Screen Protectors +\nPD SDHC Memory Card Reader + PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18.0 MP Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens with 55-250mm IS Lens + 16GB Card + Battery + Case + (2) Filters + Flash + Cleaning Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MF5kyFzlL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004PBQDU6"}}
