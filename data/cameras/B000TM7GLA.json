It was a gift and the recipient can't say enough positive things about the quality of this camera. The price is a slight disadvantage but with free shipping and no tax, the cost evens out.

Funderburk", "ReviewID": "R1F2CN8IFWU75W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has proven to be far better than I could have ever hoped!!  I purchased this camera after my previous point-shoot style camera was damaged while sandbagging a levee in Iowa...The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX55P was ordered as a hurried replacement before I left on a trip.  The camera has excellent lense quality and an outstanding array of features.  I really appreciated that the menus and functioning are pretty intuitive if you have experience using cameras.  I've mostly worked with Canon products previously and still like that gear very much.  Even though I had not used a Panasonic before, locating features was easy and intuitive.  I purchased this unit instead of the Canon because the Panasonic is a smaller, flatter camera that offers all of the same features that I wanted for much less money.Simply put, I have not used a small camera which produced such high quality photos and offered such great flexibility of use.  The flash is powerful and offers several settings.  I've used the camera in a variety of situations ranging from concerts, over dinner, by a campfire, macro photos of bugs, and in the dead of night.  All situations resulted in outstanding photos.  The battery life has been very good.  The wide angle is VERY useful. I just returned from 6 days of camping using the camera every day (not constantly) and never needed a charge.I simply can't think of anything else I would like in such a camera.  A great purchase that I could recommend to anyone.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "the lumix fx55k", "Author": "tetsudo", "ReviewID": "R3JMUERP9CLAR0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "a nice little camera beautiful to look at and to hold. the 28mm-100mm range and 3\" lcd sold me despite the warning of the high cost of the battery. i don't know if the image quality is any better than comparable competitors. wish it came with an extra battery and sd card. these hidden costs bring the price up from the initial eye-catching allure but all in all i am happy enough.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great snapshot camera", "Author": "Keith A.

The picture quality is outstanding and there is plenty of control over the size of the files. The only drawback that I found is that it does not have a fully manual setting for the exposure and the longest exposure setting appears to be about 1 sec.

The quality of the camera is very good. Feels solid and the screen quality is also good not to mention huge 3.2\". Also the inter phase is very simple and straight forward.

The 3\" LCD is a great feature and can be made brighter for intense sunlight or off-angle viewing with the touch of a button.  The face recognition and image stabilization work very well.  I was also quite impressed with the video capability. Tons and tons of features!  Did extensive research and the 55 could not be beat for the price.  Substantially less than the comparable Canon 870is.  Shorter and thinner too!

I have owned several brand of P&S; camera's Nikon, Canon, Kodak etc, and none have come close to the picture quality of this dynamo! Many of the other camera's I have owned were in the $300+ range and for the price of this camera you are getting a tremendous deal.  The Leica lens really delivers, the camera options are very intuituve & easy to navigate. The small compact size is perfect for those get-a-ways when you don't want to pack your DSLR & many shots I have taken rival shots from my Nikon DLSR. One recommendation is to buy the Lumix leather carry case, although the camera is small, it does have a boxy design and a smidge thicker than other camera's in its category & it may not fit most cases. This is to protect the supurb 3 inch LCD screen from scratches. Other than that I highly recommend the purchase of this camera. I'm even going to buy one for my Mother I'm so impressed with it!", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera, Great Display and Features", "Author": "Rob NY \"NY-Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R371PVFJV2SJ9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a excellent camera, My first surprise was how bright the display is, can been seen and read outdoors. Takes great macro shots.One issue I had was outside exposure was a bit high in bright sunlight, I adjusted it for one stop under, and now the shots have rich deep color. The camera is fast and responsive. The wide angle is perfect. Would have liked a more substantial grip, but that would have made the camera larger.

Wang", "ReviewID": "RCO4WIAAJ995K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my third camera, and I've owned it within the first week of its initial release. I was excited about the lenses, as well as the 'new' features that the line of cameras brought with them.First off, let's talk about the construction quality. The outer black is semi-scratch resistant, and has not worn away significantly within the last few years. The corners that are burnished metal have worn a little, but it is minor at best. The shiny parts in the front of the camera have gained noticeable scratches, since the detail put into them is very intricate, and fragile as a result. The screen has one small scratch that I inflicted by accident when fitting a custom screen protector onto it (how ironic, no?) Since then, the screen has not received any damage, but I do need to replace the protector fairly soon, as it's taken a heavy beating.My girlfriend knocked this camera off my table by accident one night, a fall that was approximately three feet onto wood. The camera integrity held, but for a few days the turning dial was giving me issues. This resolved itself somehow, and the camera still works fine.The camera's video capabilities are fantastic. You can film as long as you have memory and battery to spare, and I've ended up taking videos upwards of twenty minutes using this. The videos can be several different quality settings, but I recommend buying a larger capacity card and filming at the highest for the best results.Photos are nice and crisp, with best results during the day outside. Macro photos (close up) are nice too, but it's sometimes hard to get that perfect shot of something up close. Inside photos are good, but in comparison to canon cameras, I haven't been able to get those super crisp photos. The ISO setting I probably have wrong, but in darker photos there's a lot of noise. So just use flash...My favorite photo setting to use is the intelligent Auto, which automatically selects whatever setting would produce the best photo, detects people's faces, and then determines if the flash needs to be used (you can also force it on or off if you like)Battery life is fantastic! One charge can last me hours, or at least an entire day of touring. Just charge it once at night to make sure you'll still get through the rest of the day. On casual use, I only charge the camera at most once every two weeks and the battery is fine.I continue to look at the new cameras, but have not seen anything I would prefer over my lumix yet.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "SAN DIEGO, CA", "Author": "P.

Instead I get a message telling me there are no viable photos to play. I wanted to be able to edit the memory card so that I could keep using it when it was full. I'm able to copy the pics to my computer but it copies all of them every time I want to copy new ones and I have to go to extra steps to avoid the redundancy.

I can only speak for myself when I say it was not what I expected. I guess the wide angle lens is ok if you have a use for that. I personally found the zoom to be very slow and awkward. The camera is boxy and difficult to slide into a small camera case because of the shape. The LCD screen is large and unprotected making it very easy to scratch. Not that easy to view in bright sunlight, and no view finder. Picture quality is good, but I don't think it is as good as a comparable canon model. I am returning this camera even with being charged a $31 restock fee + shipping. Unfortunately this camera was not available in any store to test features, if it would have been I would have never brought it home. Sometimes advertising can be misleading.
