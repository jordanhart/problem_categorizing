{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WOW! What a camera!", "Author": "Logical Paradox \"Irrational, but True\"", "ReviewID": "RNS175M9C6IYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a snap response after recieving this camera today and playing with it for about an hour or so. First, THE GOOD:The first thing you're gonna notice about this camera is it's apearance. It's simply GORGEOUS! It's called the STYLUS for a reason! It's STYLISH! It's hands down the most attractive looking camera I've seen, it just looks cool. You're bound to get compliments any time you whip it out among company. The shiny aluminum case is no just very classy looking, but also makes for a durable and sturdy frame.The Stylus 300 Digital by Olympus is very well made, and feels firm and durable in the hand. It does'nt feel flimsy at all. You get the feeling that if you dropped it on a sidewalk a few times it would probably survive with little more than a dent (Although I wouldnt try that!). Also, it's supposedly made for all-weather use, so you should be able to take pictures in driving rain if you wanted to. You'l notice that all the ports and connectors are protected by rubber covers and all the little compartments with plastic doors (for example the little cover that you flip up to put in a memory card) covering them are sealed with rubber rims to keep out water. This is a great camera for anyone who tends to be a bit clumbsy or who wants to be able to have take pictures in bad weather.The camera is also pretty small. It may not be the smallest camera out (when compared to other super-tiny models) but it's pretty damn small! It's about the size of a pack of cigarretts! It's actually smaller than my wallet!The camera is also very well designed. There is no lens cap to loose or have to remember to put on. Instead a door slides over the lens and protects it. This same door/sleave is used to turn the camera on/off. Turning it on is as simple as flipping the door over. Start up is very quick! I was able to turn the camera on, take a picture, and turn the camera back off and in my pocket in about 10 seconds! It's pretty responsive. It's pretty quick taking pictures too, the wait time between pictures is very short (shorter than my 35mm), not quite as fast as would be wished for though.Olympus also through in a remote control! This is great for self portraits or when you want to actually be IN the pictures you're taking. The battery life apears to be pretty good, and a lithium Ion battery is included as well as a charger. Also included is a 16 MB memory card. I wish there was a little built in memory or a larger card had been included for the money. The card technology is either a new one I am not familiar with or a proprietary one - it's called \"XD picture card\". The 'card' is a TINY (about the size of thumbnail). USB is supported (as expected) and you can ussually plug the camera right in and windows (XP and ME) will automatically recognize it as a removeable drive. This is great as you can even use you're camera's memory to carry around or transfer other types of files as well which might be useful in a pinch. It also supports video out so you can view pictures on your TV.Finally there is also a movie mode that lets you take 16 second video clips. The down side is that this is in quicktime format (I would much prefer MPEG or AVI). Another thing is that the length is ALWAYS limited to 16 seconds - even if you have a 128 MB card in there, you can only take 16 second clips... that's just dumb. If I have enough memory why cant I take longer clips? Come on Olympus, release a firmware patch to allow us to take longer clips or use a different video format. There is also no sound, which is a feature that IS present in models made by cannon and Kodak (who provde both built in mics, built in speakers, and the time of your movie clips is only limited to memory restraints). This is a significant drawback if this featureset interests you, but isn't enough to weigh down the rest of the quality present.The interface is also pretty easy to use and supports plenty of features. It's not QUITE as easy as the Kodak DX4330, but most people will find it pretty simple with a minimal learning curve.All in all, this is a GREAT camera. While you're probably going to want to buy a bigger memory card, you'll probably be VERY happy with this as a choice. The only cons are the lack of support for video features - the lack of sound and the time restraints are both unexcusable considering the price.Still I give it a 5 star rating for the quality of construction and the over-all design. Im very happy with this camera, they just need to add sound to the next version. Heck, if they would just release a patch t allow video clips to use MPEG or even just allow us to take longer clips, then I would call this the ONLY CHOICE in digital cameras for the price range.", "Date": "May 7, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RPF4W8GBC5TK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a couple of weeks ago and couldn't be more happier with it. I bought this camera for its size (small and compact)and I am delighted.  I'm a point and shoot type of guy and love to take photos but hate to carry a camera.  After buying the Stylus 300, I took a 5-day trip to the desert with it in a small carrying case on my belt.  After five days of hiking and climbing, I didn't even know I was carrying a camera on my belt. If you carry a cell phone on your belt, you won't notice the Stylus 300 there. Compared to my previous digital camera (Kodak 4800)this camera is a dream to carry.  In addition, the battery life appears to be much better than the Kodak. I bought an extra battery for the trip and took approximately 150 photos during the five days and didn't run out of battery life.A couple of small gripes.  First, the camera doesn't allow you to date stamp a photo. I like to use the date stamp on occasion and the Stylus 300 won't allow you to do it.Second, there is a setting that allows you to reset the camera's settings when you shut the camera off.  Or you can choose to keep your setting when shutting down.  I would have like to see a chose to lock certain settings and have the camera reset the remaining settings you don't wish to lock.Third, the camera doesn't come with a carrying case.  I bought one for less than $10 that worked fine but an Olympus case would have been nice.However, these are minor issues that do not distract from the overall performance of the camera. I am very happy with the Stylus 300 and would recommend it to those \"point and shoot\" folks that don't like the hassle of carrying a camera around all day.", "Date": "April 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "All Weather", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2E8Y7COR8TL9O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": ".If you're looking for a digital camera for all weather situations, this (or the Stylus 400) is it.  Otherwise, move on.  There are better choices in the market for the money.  Yes I know, if you're looking at this, you've already decided on the minimum megapixels and optical zoom capabilities...  This camera is compact with a metal casing.  It fits well in the pocket and feels good in the hand.  And it takes decent pictures outdoor too.  However, the slow shutter delay can make you miss your shots.  In addition, don't expect all pictures taken in low light (indoor) to be sharp.  I consider myself as a pretty well versed photographer, and I've ended up with some blurry shots.  You'll have to hold the camera very still while waiting for the shutter to finally snap.  Please note that you won't know that the shots are blurry until you've uploaded them onto your computer - the camera screen is too small for checking this.This camera is good for toting around (small, rugged, and all weather) in case you want to take a quick snap shot for the collection and sharing of your memories.  However, my brand-new camera broke down electronically one week after purchase (second day of usage; and no, it wasn't the battery) while on work assignment off the shores Puerto Rico (and no, it didn't get wet... much).  Luckily, I had my professional Nikon SLR with me.  It took the Olympus America Inc. repair shop in Hauppauge, NY one month to repair it - they didn't have the parts on-hand.  I didn't return the camera to the store because I needed the all weather feature (note that there are no features for adjusting f-stops, and such).  By the way, I also have an all weather Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom, which uses regular film (film image resolution is still far superior to digital).

I exchanged for the exact same model, and the same dang thing happened with that one after about a month also.

I just went into Best Buy and Curcuit City and asked, \"What is your best compact model?\". Both recomended the same. I purchased this one from CC, along with a 3-year replacement warranty. I figured I would just return it if not completely satisfied. They offer a 30-day no questions deal. I think I'll keep it, though. Picture quality is amazing, both on my television screen or printed via PC. I will never own another 35mm again. I have 2 Olympus SLR's(OM 2000) and 3 lenses. You'll probably see them on Ebay soon. Great cameras, but I just got tired of carrying the units around, which later led me to not using them at all. I was going to purchase a high quality compact 35mm to replace them--glad I waited. Construction seems to be very durable. The entire housing is made of metal and almost has a jewelry-like look to it. It's hard to see in advertisments but the \"OLYMPUS\" logo on the front of the camera is holographic, and changes colors at different angles to the person viewing it. It is sold with a 16MB memory card that stores anywhere from 99 images in the lowest pixel mode, to 6 in the super high quality mode. I noticed they had larger capacity cards at the store, but I wanted to see what I needed before I started purchasing extras. The zoom feature is very nice.

Nice and small.  All weather is a plus. I can drop it in the sand and know it won't break (Of course, the camera has to be in the off mode.  If it's on and the lens is extended, then sand will definitely get inside and break it.)2. Excellent resolution and clarity outdoors.  I took many at both sunny days and cloudy/twilight nights and the clarity (without the flash) was outstanding.3. I like the fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery.  I've heard nightmare stories of dig. cameras that eat up batteries.CONS:1. Shutter speed was disappointing.  indoors with flash, it took just over 2 seconds to register the picture.  I timed it.  Outdoors, it took a touch over 1 second (1.1).  I don't know much about digital camera shutter speeds but those values seem a little long for me.2. The card type is xD. Proprietary and expensive.3.

We took about 60 pictures this weekend for my brother's graduation, about half inside with no flash, and only 4 of them came out okay.  Even the \"good\" ones weren't particularly sharp when I reduced them to 800x600.  We mostly took pictures of people; any movement on the part of the subject or the camera made the picture very blurry.  Guess it's using a slow shutter speed to compensate for the low light, though I'm surprised that it's as bad as it is!  Though, this is the only digital camera that I've used, so it might just be that I had high expectationsBesides indoor no flash shots, this camera is great.  It's pretty.  It has some weight to it which makes it feel more solid.  It's small---it easily slips into a jeans or shirt pocket.  The lithium battery that comes with the battery is great---it lasts forever.  The camera comes with a charger.  I used the camera off and on over the weekend (~60 pictures) and didn't run out of battery.  Outdoor shots are sharp and the colors are good.  The memory is pretty speedy.  I transferred over 100 meg worth of pictures in just a few minutes.  Oh, and since the battery is so good, you don't need to worry about buying one of those special download hookups.  Just plug the USB cable into the camera and start downloading!One thing that I particularly love (being the computer geek that I am) is that I can mount the camera as a USB drive under linux, no special software needed.  I just \"mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb\" and copy the files over.

In low light situations, the Sony AF Illuminator shoots a red light towards the subject so the AF can lock onto it. Perfect pictures. Olympus, on the other hand, cannot \"lock\" onto the subject, and you always end up with blurred subjects. Another bad result - since it cannot determine how far the subject is from the camera, it floods everything with the flash. So aside from blurred, the subject is whited-out.In daylight, the Sony also was superior. Colors were deeper, and edges were clean. I took a picture of an orchid, and with the Olympus, the outline of the petal was jagged.

I was so impressed with the photo quality from that camera that I decided to stay with Olympus when I moved to a more compact camera. I loved my C3000 but I found I was leaving it at home because of its size.The Olympus name and the compact size of the Stylus 300 was what initially attracted me to it. The promise of being \"weatherproof\" sold me. I have to admit, although heavy, the size was perfect. Not too big. Not too small. I carried it everywhere. However, that's where my love affair with the Stylus 300 ends. The autofocus was slow. Woefully slow. I found a majority of my photos were blurred. Yes, I know how to operate the autofocus. However, for most spontaneous shots, the autofocus lagged behind.I was willing to work around that because of its size and, again, the promise of being \"weatherproof.\" That promise was broken a couple of months ago. On our way to an outdoor concert, it began to rain. \"No problem!\" I confidently told my companions, \"I'll take my camera. It's weatherproof.\" It's not. Before leaving the car, I checked to make sure the port doors were closed properly and the camera looked as sealed as it should be. To be fair, the camera functioned for an hour or two just fine. I was able to snap a few pictures as the rains came down. But the next shot I attempted greeted me with flashing green lights. That's when I noticed the water. The viewfinder was half full of water! At this point, I shut the camera off and stowed it back in my rain gear.Back at home, I opened all the doors to the camera and placed it on the dresser for several days. I'd hoped that the damage was limited to the viewfinder and that, once dry, the camera would be ok. No such luck. It hasn't worked since. The camera is out of warranty or I'd send it to Olympus.Initially, I was mildly disappointed with the picture quality from this camera. Now, I feel cheated. For a brief second, I looked at the Stylus Verve because of its size and its claim of being \"weatherproof.\" I soon came to my senses.

Overall, this is a good camera for someone who wants a simple, easy to use, 3.2 megapixel camera.  Being 3.2 mp, it gives great quality for 4 x 6 photos.  If you are someone who wants a standard digital camera and are not intent on taking artistic photos in clubs, or high -definition landscape photos, then this is for you.As a run down:PROS:+Sturdy casing (I have dropped it and it is fine)+Many photo options (if you need them, i.e. manual white-balance, macro mode, self-timer)+On auto mode as soon as you slide the cover open (ON) so you can point and shoot+Water resistant (great for all my travels)CONS:-The slide cover (though initially I thought it was great that the camera lens has extra protection from dust and the lens retracts completely, the slide door has started to malfunction.  A few times, I slide it open and the camera doesnt even turn on.  After another try, it is okay.  Consider, that I have used this camera very frequently in the past 2 yrs so I am not completely surprised)-Dim Light conditions produce bad photos when object is far away, i.e. people on beach at sunset-Dark conditions produce bad photos (when on night mode, the exposure is just longer, which creates extremely blurry photos)-Video mode is ONLY 16 seconds and no soundIf you don't have the need for the newer 5mp+ cameras, then go ahead and buy this camera for a cheap price off amazon or similar because it is a decent camera for day-to-day shots if you are not picky.

The viewfinder works great but would be nice if it was larger and includid the number of pictures remaining and battery condition.

Very good company and very fast. 5.The delay from turn-on to actural taking a photo is more that a 35 mm camera but I am getting used to it. I plan to sell off some of my 35 mm cameras on ebay since the digital works so well. 6.Some have said the included software is lacking. Well I have not used it. I just uploaded images to the computer and then to the free Sony web site. It works great and allows some editing. Did I mention it is for free. They have some nice options for printing, and mugs with your prints that are worth checking out. Yahoo also has a good free site for free online storage of your images. Each image takes about thirty seconds to up load with a  fast DSL connection. 7. Have taken the camera to Sam's club do  prints using their computer to do the photo editing for 17 cents a print... they are printed in about 25 minutes am I am on my way...

I shoot otherwise with a Pentax K10 SLR (and SLR film cameras, or a square-format when I have spare time to play). I have gotten prize-winning photographs from this little camera and am rarely unsatisfied with the images it produces. It is easy to use, small enough to fit in my pocket or glove compartment or clip on my purse when I don't want to take along one of my 'big boys.' I like metal-body cameras for durability - especially at low temperatures. I've had this outside shooting in below freezing conditions and haven't had to worry that if I drop it the body would smash in a million pieces at impact. I've taken it traveling in Europe and the Middle East, and road tripping across the United States. It's an absolute gem! In addition my original 300 ended up (after 2 or so years of use) dropped behind a car and partly backed over. The LCD cracked and there was some bent metal involved, but the amazing thing kept working for another 5 weeks - including a quick trip to England with friends - and shot great pictures until it died (i didn't feel it owed me a thing at that point!). I replaced it with a 410, and have now been loving that for about 5 years. The 410 is a little slower to be ready to take the next shot - i think maybe they used the same processors that the 300 has and the extra information in the higher megapixels means it takes a touch longer to record. Also, I would say with either model if I have a 1 or 2 GB card in there and it gets full the camera does take longer to get fully powered up when i switch it on.LOVE LOVE LOVE the REAL viewfinder. None of this shooting only with the screen business. You can shut off the screen to save battery power if you are using it on a long hike or rafting trip or whatever and won't be able to charge it for a long time. Hard to find in the newer point&shoots.;I would get a used or refirb of this camera in a heartbeat before most of the newer 10mp cameras i've handled for friends. The 3mp shoots quick, clear, photos that can be blown up to 8x10 easily. i think it's pretty rare that you would need more if you're not a national geographic pro.More is surely not always better when it comes to a higher # of megapixels.

Over the years the cover begins to bend outwards, allowing it to 'miss' the internal switch. The cover acts as an on/off switch and, when it malfunctions, leaves the camera useless.To fix the issue:* Remove the two lower cover screws using a \"dollar store\" precision screwdriver. Watch out as a metal screw plate will drop.* With the cover removed, gently bend the entire cover inwards along its horizontal axis (\"creasing\" the olympus logo)* The idea is to bend the cover just enough to create a snug fit once again onto the camera body.* When you feel satisfied, reinstall the front cover. Make sure to align the metal screw plate. I found the best way to align the cover was to install it in the closed position (lens all the way it, cover slide closed, install two screws)* Test camera cover functionality. Readjust if necessary.I have had 100% success with this on two 'broken' cameras. One was my original and the other was one I bought from e-bay specifically sold as 'for parts- broken'.Anyways, aside from the obvious manufacturing flaw here, these are not bad cameras. They take descent 3.2MP pictures and are small enough to slip in any purse or pocket. Battery life will last you about 500 photos (give or take flash and zoom use). The 'All Weather' stamp is really just a joke. Any fool can tell by examining the body that it was not engineered for 'all weather'. Yes it has rubber grommets and rubber boots at the doors and buttons, but they really were not designed for a rainstorm.

I checked around to get an estimate on 'tightening' the piece and found that minimally it would cost at least $100.As Olympus advertised a customer satisfaction trade in policy, I e-mailed them.  I waited a few days for an answer, and e-mailed again.  When I still didn't receive an answer, I phoned.  I did this a number of times as I couldn't seem to get around the voice mail system.

When I said I thought that was ridiculous, I became subject to quite a tongue lashing, along with attitude from the Olympus rep.  When I told him I was not pleased,  and that any additional money I spent would go towards a different camera from a manufacturer other than Olympus, he became abusive.I am now shopping for replacement cameras, and have been to two stores, neither of which stock Olympus equipment.  When I asked why, I was told that Olympus' lack of customer service and failure to honor warranties were the reason.This is the first review I have ever written, and it's fair to point out that I was quite happy with my little Stylus for the first nine months, however, owing to the manufacturer's lack of concern, snarky reps and failure to honor printed guarantees, I can say that I will never again purchase anything Olympus.Buyer beware....", "Date": "August 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "There must be a better camera", "Author": "gjportland", "ReviewID": "R14JSXQ1B8QFXF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I gave my Nikon digital to my daughter when I purchased the Olympus because I wanted a camera that was more 'weatherproof'.  We spend quite a bit of time at the beach and involve ourselves in some watersports (kayaking).  I did not feel comfortable with having the Nikon even near anything wet.  Upon examining the Olympus, I suspected that its 'weatherproofness' was pretty weak.  The hatch covers for the battery and usb port are quite flimsy and way too easy to open accidentally.  Although the covers do have 'o' ring type seals, it was obvious these will not hold back nominal splashing water.  Also, the lens slide is very vulnerable to sand -- so taking the slide off and cleaning the slide grooves has become routine. Mechanically, the camera just seems cheap --unlike the less expensive Nikon that feels solid.Using the camera is much more involved than the Nikon.  I didn't appreciate Nikon's menu setup/controls until I used the Olympus.  It drove me nuts  -- and still does.On the plus side, the pics seem fine.

You can see the picture you just took and leave it on, but not all of your photos. I didn't think this was a big deal but I find it annoying. Also, the buttons on the camera are very small and built low to the frame of the camera. This makes it good for durability because they won't snap off or crack from getting bumped or such, but, they are kind of hard to push.

I decided to buy this as my first digital camera because I had been impressed with the Olympus Stylus 80 film camera I have had for several years (and still do). The stylus digital takes reasonable pictures compared with other digital cameras my friends own, and the battery life is excellent. I invested in the 256MB memory card and still haven't found out how many pictures you can cram on it at normal quality, but it's a lot.I had complaints from the beginning however, about the space of time between my pressing the button and the actual taking of the shot. When you are trying to take pictures of children, the 1 or 1 1/2 second gap makes it nearly impossible to get the shot you were trying to get, and the good pictures I have gotten of my kids have been almost accidental. I was also disappointed to discover the limitations of the included software, which does not allow you to e-mail pictures unless you give Olympus another $20 for the privilege. Frankly, I thought this was a simple gouge, and I resented it.My worst disappointment however, came recently. The camera shut off because the battery was exhausted. However, when I put in the fresh battery I had (and later, the recharged battery I had been using) the camera appeared to have frozen up. The lens will not extend and the little orange and green lights next to the viewfinder flash simultaneously and the camera beeps, a signal which, according to the manual, means that the battery is dead. Well, it 'aint! I cannot get the camera to work and the warranty will not be honoured where I live.

However, I am going to eastern Europe, and wanted a smaller camera that, were I to lose or break it, would not be such a major financial loss. I stuck with Olympus when making my purchase, and was not expecting much from this camera. But it has turned out to be an excellent purchase, and I like it as much as my other camera.First, the size is great. There are smaller cameras, but this one is tiny, and doesn't get heavy when you carry it around all day. The picture quality is good, and there are more features than I expected for the price. The zoom capability is not bad, either. And, of course, it is attractive, though a purchase probably shouldn't be based on that reason alone.I actually like the movie-taking ability. I have a camcorder for real video, and don't mind that this camera takes short \"movies\" without sound. But, it's more of a novelty than a selling feature. Much like the panorama feature, it's useful only for recording particularly beautiful or interesting places for a more realistic memory.The things I don't like about this camera are probably due more to personal preference than anything else. First, I don't like the fact that it doesn't take AA batteries. I like to bring a few sets of rechargeables on a trip, and know that I can buy regular batteries if necessary. It's also disappointing that the battery cannot be charged inside the camera. I suppose that the lithium battery is to be expected with a small camera, however. The battery life of this camera is good, and I bought an extra battery just in case. I don't expect that I will have to bring a charger and adapter unless I am going on an extended trip. The xD media card is also not thrilling. It is small and makes sense with a smaller camera, but for those of us who already have digital cameras, it is annoying to have to buy expensive new cards when buying a new camera. It was not important enough, though, to deter me from making this purchase.Like another reviewer, I have had some issues with blurry pictures, though the problem is not unique to this camera. I figured out that using the viewfinder rather than the screen greatly reduces this problem.Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something small and relatively inexpensive for travel, or to someone who takes casual pictures and doesn't care about attaching lenses, f-stops or that type of stuff.

Its held up beautifully with minor scratches- Its also water resistant for spills- It has digital zoom which allows you to take pictures of things that are pretty far away.  Although the pictures come out more fuzzy than normal, It allowed me to get sufficient pictures of things that I could only see through my high powered binocularsCONS- You definietly need to get a bigger memory card with this camera since the one it comes with only takes about 24 picures.

I'd say, if you like this camera, buy it, try it, then pawn it on ebay, but I'd go for the Sony P72, which I also have now.  That's quick and puts the nifty date on the pictures.  Plus some sony tv's now have memory stick slots.", "Date": "July 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera!", "Author": "L. M.

(Although not yet stylish as Canon Elph's.) Good battery life but the extra battery costs a lot. You can't put in AA batteries in this one.Average image quality indoors. Good outdoors. Slow to focus and has annoying shutter lag. No manual features and many photos need to be tweaked in photoshop. Video mode is junk.Uses propreitary xD cards, just another way for Fuji/Oly to rip off consumers. What was wrong with standard SD or CF cards? Imagine the chaos if every manufacturer used different memory cards.Back to the camera, its a good attempt by Olympus but still way behind Canon, Sony, Pentax, Nikon and Minolta.

Beware that if you buy this, the software that comes with it to download your photos onto your computer will only let you edit and print those photos.  In other words, you CANNOT e-mail or even save them to disk without purchasing the upgrade to the software from Olympus.  Also, the camera takes okay photos, but I noticed that 1 out of every 5 or 6 photos is blurred for no apparent reason.  I am not a professional photographer, but this is my third Olympus digital camera and it is the most expensive and poorest performer overall.  That's not to say that it's a bad camera, but I would have expected better for the price.Having said that, it does have some useful settings, and I love the compactness and portability of this camera.  I'm just very annoyed that they're expecting everyone to pay for the upgrade to the software to make the photos taken with this camera share-able digitally.", "Date": "May 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera, but limited functionality", "Author": "Chris W", "ReviewID": "R1P7HBAOPRBRLU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Olympus Stylus series of cameras are very unique in their functions; they are weather resistant. There are two models of the Stylus series; a 3.2 (Stylus 300) and a 4.0 (Stylus 400) mega pixel unit. Today we will examine the 3.2 mega pixel Stylus 300 unit which is very similar to the 4.0. This compact camera fits into any shirt pocket with ease, it weighs a bit more than most cameras (5.8oz. or 165g), which is probably due to the additional materials needed to weather-proof the camera. The 3.2 megapixel camera packs a punch, but has a hefty price tag. Is it worth its price tag, or is there a better alternative? Read on and find out what we think.
