Apparently these are the same people who do not have dvd players or ipods or maybe even cell phones. Welcome to the 21st century! This is an easy camera if you have any idea at all how to use a digital one. I have had one that is far more expensive that was so much less user friendly. This camera is actually for my 4 year old. It is pink and chunky, and easy for her to navigate. It is not like the slim model camera that I have, in other words this camera can take a little more rough treatment-not that it can be thrown or submersed in water like kiddie cameras can. But, I have a mature 4 year old who loves taking pics and is quite good, so I decided to get this after having an awful experience with a kiddie camera. The mp's are just right and though it may not have the pic quality of a 250 dollar camera, it does its thing just fine. For the people that are complaining about quality, you get what you pay for. It does not cost much, it works well, and for anyone with any kind of electronic ability it is easy. Remember, my 4 year old uses it, and I only showed her 1 time how to erase, review, zoom and play. So there's my review! Happy snapping...", "Date": "February 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "This camera is a bit complicated", "Author": "T. Clark \"T. Palmer\"", "ReviewID": "R3LDD6BENOPQZW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd digital camera.  I know how to use a digital, and have had different types.  For the money I paid, it is a great camera.  There are so many different options, I am still learning them.But as it was said in another review, this is a complex camera.  There are so many options, that you end up going around in circles before you find what you want again.  Without realizing it, I kept turing off the flash, I am not even sure which button was doing it yet.  also, my pictures were blurry, it was because I had to go in a set the lighting as well.It isn't so complicated that you won't be able to take pics with it, but if the setting isn't perfect, it will take you a while to set the camera to take a good picture.  Which means, if there is a \"kodak\" moment, you may miss it because you will be setting your camera to fit the picture.If someone really thinks this is a super simple camera, then they more than likely haven't used every option yet.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "A real review", "Author": "J.

I would have bought myself one if it wasn't pink.  It is very easy to use as far as digital cams go.  Got it for my 7 year old, she loves it.pros: great pics for the money especially with the 2gb card so cheap  easy to navigate and use  video mode is fun, love the zoom in video mode  clear screencons: batteries do go fast but it's tolerable  lens pops open when you power it on, even just to view picsIf you don't own a digital camera or like a good deal then buy it!", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "GREAT LITTLE CAMERA", "Author": "K.

The color is beautiful. I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves almost everything about it. The pictures are nice and clear. She can zoom in from a distance and the shots are still crisp and clear.The only drawback to this particular camera is the way it sucks batteries dry even when it's off. I have a digital camera of my own and can leave batteries in it all the time and use it when we travel for hours on end and it doesn't suck battery life. This particular camera though is a different story. It will suck batteries dry within minutes even when it's turned off.I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just Right", "Author": "B.

For those having trouble with it..try a fully manual camera for awhile, then go back to this one...you will appreciate the ease of use, trust me..LOL...no dialing up shots, setting shutter and F-stops and exposure compensation...just turn it on, push half way down on shutter button till it focuses, then push it fully down...almost perfect shot every time...image quality is a little low compared to higher MP cameras, but still not bad..6 million pixels is a pretty good resolution compared to some 1.3MP cell phone cameras..I keep it in my work truck to take shots of jobsites before and after work is done...rugged, durable case, lens tucks away inside the camera when its off and small shutter covers lens to protect it..Good buy and I would buy another should this one ever fail..The 2 AA batteries is a bonus as well, cheap to replace and as long as there is a store open, you are never out of power..unlike some specific rechargeable batteries in some cameras that take up to 2 hours to recharge. And while recharging, your camera is unusable..", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "polaroid i633", "Author": "KATRINA", "ReviewID": "R293HR6X8COEKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got this camera from my 20 year old daughter. i reead all the reviews both good and bad.the only problem that i really agree with is the problem with the battery lif. i agree that the battery life is bad, but i hope solve the problem by using rechargable batteries. somthing people need to realize, if you have a camera video camera, i pod, or cell phone that have alot of functions on them and you use them, especially video, i promise, you will burn your batteries. other than that i hope to hav no problems with this camera.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Toy", "Author": "MJ", "ReviewID": "R3KBG5MO0EMA7P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I didn't get this camera at Amazon. I got it in an electronic store in my neigborhood. I wasn't really looking for a camera, but the price on this one was great! I asked the salesman what the camera's drawback was, being that it's so cheap. He joked that it couldn't cook eggs, so I bought the camera. I was greatly disapointed. I didn't expect great pictures, being that it was so cheap, but I was very disappointed after I took a picture (no matter on which setting - I tried them all) that I couldn't tell if I just took a picture of a face or a plate of spaghetti . The camera wasn't returnable, so I gave it to my little sister (It's a great toy) and replaced it with a Canon camera from Amazon (which should arrive shortly and I hope to give a posotive review on it). For those that already own this camera and are trying to get it to work, I found that if you go far from the target you're trying to capture and zoom before you snap than the picture comes out a lot clearer.
