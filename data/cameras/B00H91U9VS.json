Bivona \"Jimmy Bivona, Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R2OJH8WLQNKUZ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is elegant. It is the quintessential 'digital' camera. It weighs less than 2 ounces and is the size of a matchbox. I carry it in a small leather pouch in my pocket - all the time. It does lovely stills ( very wide angle with slight barrel distortion ) and 2 wide videos. I don't know the exact angles but they are extreme. The quality of all the images is superlative. I carry a Sony DSC-HX200v, a Sony TX-1 and a Canon 6D in a Swiss Army backpack most of the time too. I'm very fond of these cameras for obvious reasons.The Mobius is a welcome member of this gang. I glued some velcro to the bottom of it's case and the bill of a tight fitting cap so that I can wear it. The camera records 4 gb, 31 minute videos and repeats the process until the battery runs out without any bother on my part. I plug it into a USB port on my computer and it downloads my imagery and then recharges the battery if I just leave it alone and don't mess with it. Definitely my kind of a pal and no burden on my funds.The camera came with the 'A' lens and if the 'B' lens is now available I'll change it out.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product!", "Author": "Dana Teel", "ReviewID": "RE5INZD41IDHG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This isn't the big thrills and frills kind of camera. What it is is small, light and very flexible. I use this camera to make videos when I'm flying my RC helicopters and these features were of paramount importance to me as most all of my helicopters are considered micro helis. I'm quite happy with the quality of the picture and programmable features of this camera.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Edward Spidell", "ReviewID": "R36GXAL8MMUSQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great little camera I use it on my quad copter and take aerial photography and video.

I wanted a camera that was light, small and could film video faster than 30 frames per second. This camera is HD and meets all of my needs. Plus it is reasonably priced. I am very happy with it.  I was thinking Go Pro but it is more than 3 times the cost and much larger and heavier.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent value for the price", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"svrider\"", "ReviewID": "R1H4KBKSK9UAGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The biggest selling points are 1) small and light; 2) excellent video quality at 1080p; 3) easy access to settings; 4) multitude of settings that are easy to change. I put in a Samsung microSD 32GB card rated at 10 speed class and it works perfectly. While 1080p is excellent, the camera is after all a camera so in low light (on a bicycle) it struggles to capture license plates that are legible. In good daylight it's not an issue. The battery lasts about 80 minutes. 25 minutes of recording takes up about 2.7 GB. I don't know if the Mobius only works at USB 2.0, but that's what I have on my PC, which means it takes a while to offload a large file.I tried mounting it on bike handlebars using only rubber bands. It works, after a fashion but I believe there's more vibration compared to a standard mount. Even with a standard mount there is some vibration. The camera does not have any kind of stabilization.One drawback is that the Mobius is not in any way waterproof or water resistant. It's somewhat fragile, so it's probably not appropriate to use as a Black Box.While some people have complained about the heat sinks getting hot, that's not a problem on a bicycle. No issues there. I wish it came with the pull tie bar mount, but I've only seen that on the Mobius website for the Action Cam Pro package. I think this is the best camera for small size and image quality.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for the price, but some rolling shutter", "Author": "Eric C.", "ReviewID": "R333XXYAMZF5LO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you don't want to shell out for a GoPro, then this is a great camera.

Best not purchased by the tech challenged tho.Comes with no instructions, but go to U tube for many reviews and how-to's.Can easily find the well written manual on line, in addition to the very professional software for completely understanding and changing the options on this camera. Can be used for so many applications.Picture quality is amazing and can be set to accommodate so many shooting conditions. Can even change color rendition far beyond the understanding of most all who will purchase this.Literature says the battery life is 80 minutes. I left mine on continuously to verify this, and found that my new unit ran more than 90 minutes before shutting down.Doesn't come with a flash drive, but what instead is a MicroSD card to USB adapter.Also see the many memory options bundled with this purchase that you can buy along with the camera for a fair extra cost! Sky's the limit!Sound is far from CD quality, but this package is ever so cheap for all you get! Nothing else I have shopped for compares.
