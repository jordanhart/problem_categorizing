{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera...Not so great Accessories", "Author": "Patrick J Rider", "ReviewID": "ROD2ZT3A1606B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Coolpix P520 camera is great for a point & shoot camera.  It has plenty of picture settings to satisfy most non-SLR camera users.  Comfortable in the hand and not nearly as heavy as I had expected.  Some have reviewed it saying it felt cheap but I find its construction to be solid.  I love the color (Red) and would not change it but the glossy finish is definitely a fingerprint magnet.  All said, the camera is a good value and I would recommend it to anyone looking to score some quality photos.The accessories that come with this kit are pretty much a good value as well with one exception.  The case that is included with the kit is a waste of good material.  First of all, it's to small for even the camera to fit properly let alone any of the accessories.  And the first time I tried to open the top, one of the two zippers jammed and ultimately broke.  Good thing the were two zippers on it.  The remaining items in this kit are of good value.On a side note...if you are looking for a good camera case then try the Think Tank Sub Urban Disguise 30 Shoulder Bag.  It looks great, has plenty of room for your camera and loads of cool nooks and crannies all over the bag for all of the accessories.  It even has a place for your tablet.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera Package...", "Author": "Carolyn Buergler", "ReviewID": "RSDKN0KM52OG2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera. High end 'point and shoot' camera. I bought it for the wifi capabilities, have not used that part of it yet because the wifi plug has been backordered. It would have been nice to have that or the wifi SD card included in the package. That being said, it was a nice package deal with the extra SD card, extra battery & charger, all the items that I would have needed to purchase additional for the camera. The pic quality is awesome. With the 18mg all the pic's keep their clarity even when zoomed for editing! The 42x optical zoom is amazing outdoors! Indoors if I go the full 42x zoom, I can't seem to get it to focus, but that may be me, I'm still learning the camera. So far I am loving this camera. I did not want an SLR but I wanted SLR quality, this camera seems to fit the bill for me...Oh, and LOVE the dark red color!!
