Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R1S2YVAS9NAT9Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have not found any color distortions to my images so far on a Nikon D90.  I think it's more of a lens protector than a filter since it doesn't do UV filtering.  But, I bought it because I wanted it do just that - to protect my original lenses from scratches and dust.  The ring is thin, so it hugs close to the original lens and doesn't affect the field of view.  Or at least I didn't notice it.  The ring is metal and sturdy, too.There is one thing I do wonder about.  Since the ring is some type of metal and the filter is glass, does it induce static?  I use a lens brush, and several times I noticed that after brushing the filter and blowing at the same time, I still see a few tiny dust particles that won't get off the filter.  But after I stop brushing, wait a few seconds, and then blow again, the particles finally lift off and go away.  Would be nice if they made these filters static-resistent, too.Quality wise, this thing gets 5 stars.  But only because of the price, I'm giving it 4.  I do wish the price was cheaper.  But then again, perhaps you get what you pay for.  Still, I wish it was cheaper:)", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon 67mm Clear Filter", "Author": "B.

I think the glass and coating on this filter are top notch.  I can't tell any degradation of photos and can't even tell it's on.  I notice no flare either.  However, the construction of the frame is subpar for the quality of the glass.  When I first got it out of the case, I heard a small \"clink\" and when cleaning it later, I found out why.  The glass is held in by basically a snap ring.  If you don't know what this is, look it up on Wiki.  I used to work a a pro photo lab, and even the cheap filters we sold there were held in by a ring that screwed into the frame.  If the glass was loose, just tighten the ring... easy fix.  The glass in my filter sometimes rotates on cleaning and is so loose, it will clink if moved back and forth.  I think I can easily fix this with a little epoxy, but man, should a $40 filter be this cheaply made?  I also have purchased two 77mm ones costing more, and they are constructed exactly the same.  I also have several Hoyas and a B+W.  The Hoyas seem constructed better, but I'm not sold on the optics yet.  The B+W is actually an ND filter ($100) and is of superior build.You get what you pay for... kinda.  Great glass, suspect construction.

Awad", "ReviewID": "R36Z68ESFXFVR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to purchase this filter as I was not happy with the minimal color cast that the \"Tiffen 67mm UV Protection Filter\" was leaving on my photos. I purchased the Tiffen filter due to the fact that it was less than half the price of the Nikon filter. The thing is every time that I looked at my photos taken with the UV filter on I was always slightly let down. The colors were always a little more vibrant when I took photos without the filter. Almost no book I read or photography blog I looked at advised using your lenses without a protective glass on front of the lens. My lenses are not as expensive as the professional ones are, but they are not cheap either. So I started looking for a different filter to cover my lenses and as I use Nikon I decided to try those. There is some debatable optical functionality for the UV filters but nobody uses them for their UV characteristics. They are used as lens covers that's it. When I laid my UV Tiffen filters side by side with my newly purchased NC (neutral color) Nikon filters on a white sheet of paper as advised by other reviewers of this product I was awed by the clarity of the Nikon glass. I honestly put my finger immediately on the glass as I thought that it fell of the rim and got lost somewhere, leaving a massive fingerprint on a beautiful clear glass that took me a while to clean up. It is that good. I wish I bought it from the beginning, now I have two useless UV filters sitting in my bag for no reason. I tried to save money and ended up paying more.
