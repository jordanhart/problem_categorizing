{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great expectations 95 % fulfilled...", "Author": "Ken Cook", "ReviewID": "R2Z4XD84A85BE5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've read several reviews of the Kodak DC4800 and agree with most of the positive reviews and very little of the negative ones...Now, prospective  wise, this is my very first digital camera so I can offer my opinion with  no previous digital camera experience.  I have used several upper high end  35mm cameras in my life and do know a little more than your average  shooter; with that in mind, I will continue with my review.First of all,  I got much more than I actually expected.  All of my enlargments and prints  have been done on my HP Deskjet 970CXI printer with Kodak Glossy Inkjet 45  pound paper...some were enlarged and printed from the lowest megapixel  level (.8) and others were done with the highest megapixel (3.1)  The  results have been much better than expected...the color was terrific and  the detail was excellent.  The only pictures I took which I considered  below excellent quality were, for the most part, due to my mistakes  regarding settings, movement when shooting in low light and perhaps greater  expectations from the flash than you would normally get with a good 35mm  camera...now, a couple of the reviews have mentioned that the flash and  focus when taking pictures inside or with low light were far below the  quality they were expecting.  They may well have a point, however, I  attributed these lower quality shots more to my inexperience with the  camera and wrong settings than I actually was willing to blame on the  camera....when I became more familiar with the limits of the camera, I was  able to overcome 95 % of my original poorer quality shots...in other words,  when I actually understood the limitations of the camera, I was able to  take much better photos with clearly focused shots and excellent  color...Now, a word about expectations;  I never really counted on any  camera giving me 100 % of everything I expected...it just isn't reality.  Different cameras within different price ranges simply are not going to hit  our needs 100 % of the time.  With my zero level experience with digital  cameras and years of amateur level 35mm work, I simply was willing to  forgive a few shortcomings if I got what I consider excellent pictures 95 %  of the time.Some have commented on the lame flash which is built into  the camera...I never actually expected a lot from it so I was not  disappointed when the shots taken from more than ten feet were not as good  as one might expect.  On the other hand, the camera does have a connection  to attach a higher end external flash unit so I would tend to think that  even this objection might be overcome if one were to use a good external  flash unit.  I would be interested in hearing some reports. Like any other  camera shooting in low light, if it drops to a longer shutter speed, you  had better keep it still or go to a tripod for more stability.  I actually  attributed a couple of my poor shots to this rather than a focus problem.  Having said the above, I do consider myself a novice digital photograpy  buff, however, I can tell you, if you want a camera which is a whole lot of  fun and gives you excellent options to venture more into creative control,  I  would consider getting one.  If, however, you are expecting an end all,  do all, camera, I seriously doubt if you can find one on the market.  Perhaps the extremely high end professional cameras can give you lots of  what your looking for, however, I tend to think that even they have  limitations...", "Date": "September 19, 2000"}, {"Title": "advanced point and shoot", "Author": "Nick \"ndoble\"", "ReviewID": "R36I08W73C4NAX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is Kodak's entry into the 3 megapixel market (and some reports indicate that this is the first of Kodak's digital cameras to be designed  by Kodak Japan), and considering that Kodak did so well at 2MP with the  DC280, one expects a formidable digital camera, and gets it, for the most  part.  This is my second Kodak digital camera and I've continued to  purchase Kodak because with digital cameras the camera is also the film and  no one knows how to make film quite like Kodak, a la Kodachrome.  The  previous DC280 is a point and shoot camera only, and while the DC4800  offers manual control of many functions, it still basicaslly a point and  shoot camera - for instance, with the DC4800 no control of focus is  possible, and if you want to change shutter speed you have to go through  several levels of menu (no less than 10 button presses to get to the  shutter speed menu and then as much as another 12 to choose the speed).  Hopefully, as the digital era progresses digital cameras will become more  like the SLRs of old with manual control of every function and all the  controls on the body of the camera, rather then buried deep in menus.  (I  understand Olympus is about to release its E10 which is like a digital SLR;  however the price will be about $2000.)That given, lets examine the  Kodak DC4800.The positives -For me, after the 3MP resolution and the  3X lens, what impresses me most about the DC4800 is the high quality, high  contrast, high resolution, high brightness backpanel LCD, which is now  truly useful, unlike that on the DC280.  The backpanel controls have also  been improved somewhat with a 4 axis \"joy\" button. The camera has  a strap post on each side of the body so one can use a neckstrap; the  wide/telephoto control is a \"wiggle\" switch under the thumb; and  the viewfinder has a diopter control for those of us needing glasses.  The  DC4800 communicates with the computer through USB only (and unlike the  DC280 can be used at the same time as other USB devices) and acts just like  a flash card reader appearing to the computer as a external, removable  drive, with the fast downloading of a reader.  The front of the DC4800 lens  is well protected, unlike the DC2800.  The manual is typical Kodak well  done, but strangely enough, as with the DC280 manual, the markings in the  viewfinder are not explained.  Exposure after pressing the shutter button  in almost instantaneous and despite the larger file size of a 3MP file,  saving the the file to the CF is considerably faster that the DC280.  Digital zooom is surprisingly good, thanks to the 3MP high density.The  negatives -I was very surprised to find that the lens barrel appears in  the lower right corner of the viewfinder at 28mm; I don't know if this is  not unusual for a point and shoot as I've never owned one before, but I  come close to finding it unacceptable.  The battery situation with the  DC4800 is not much improved so far as I can tell, even though the camera  uses an expensive (proprietary?) Kodak lithium-ion battery; the user will  surely have to invest in a $80 battery and charger kit if extended and  away-from-the-home use in anticipated.  Like the DC280, the battery cover  of the DC4800 can be knocked open by a blow to the bottom of the camera  body - those comtemplating active use should secure the battery cover with  tape.  The DC4800 is supplied with only a 16MB CF card and the buyer can  expect to spend an additional $200+ on a large CF card, which along  with  the $80 extra battery and charger will amount to an additional $300+  investment.  The camera acts only as a CF reader and is not TWAIN  compliant, which leads to lots of inconveniences in saving files.  The  backpanel LCD gets dark in sunlight.  As with the DC280, the tripod mount  is plastic and apparently not intended for serious use.One additional  comment - those buying a digital camera should check back with the  manufacturer for updated firmware - in Kodak's case there were lots of  early complaints about battery life problems with the DC280 which were  largely solved with later firmware.", "Date": "August 25, 2000"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R2X7F0029TBRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading some of the negative reveiws, I felt I had to respond. Having used and tried many digital cameras including the Canon 3030 and Nikon 990, I can tell you that for the price you cannot buy a better camera.  The problems with focusing that people complain about is that they probably did not have the focus set properly.  There is a macro and infinity setting that has to be set correctly. I know because I had that problem at first but it was my fault. I use the camera in the OR all the time and NEVER have a problem with the focus. As far as the batteries, Kodak did it right. I can easily take 40 high quality pictures using the LED without recharging and the batteries are less than half the weight of 4 AA batteries. The Canon doesn't even include rechargeable batteries for $999. The controls are so user friendly that I can show the nurses how to take great pictures for me in 2 minutes.  Try that with the Canon which is way too confusing or even the bulky Nikon 990. I don't understand the \"problem\" with the flash - it works well to 10 ft which is all it was meant for.  The best part about the flash is that I can take pictures from 1 ft away and not overexpose the picture. All in all, it is a great compact 3 megapixel camera at a great price.", "Date": "October 21, 2000"}, {"Title": "Absolutely great camera", "Author": "Jamie Roberts", "ReviewID": "R2U30VS2IJBGHF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off--I'm spoiled, photographically: for years I've loved using good 35mm Minolta, Nikons and large format film cameras, mainly as an amateur photographer, but also as a freelance from time to time. When I took the digital plunge, I thought this camera would be more of a supplement to my other cameras. I was wrong--now I usually take the Kodak with me and leave the others behind. In short, this is just a great camera, which I've had for about two months now. It can be a bit complex to set up, and on \"Program\" the results are predictably just OK, but once you use it like a film camera the results are incredible. The control over many photographic settings--and the way Kodak has translated digital controls into \"35mm film\" settings(like ISO settings, effective focal lengths and such)--is simply fantastic. It's small enough to take with me when a full-blown 35mm Nikon setup is just too bulky (like when I'm biking); it also produces pictures that rival the 35mm. At first, I thought the indoor flash was a bit weak; you can hook up another set of flashes, however, for serious lighting. More importantly, I also found that when I set the camera properly for flash (fill works well, for instance), and proper ISO settings, that I got much better results. The macro and distance settings are effective as well, though I'm not sure why you need the distance setting with an autofocus camera. Flaws? Only in packaging--I wish that Kodak had included a case and neutral lens filter, but that's a very small complaint.", "Date": "November 13, 2000"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera - Get the Firmware Update though", "Author": "Jonathan Pace", "ReviewID": "R3CG4SD1ZABD1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera friday afternoon, and by sunday night I had taken 200 pictures.  Let me tell you, this camera is AWESOME.  One word of caution though, GET THE FIRMWARE UPDATE FROM KODAK.COM as SOON as you get the camera.  The update fixes an autofocus issue that can leave some lower light and indoor pictures grainier in appearance than they should. Also, buy the battery and charger.  The charger will fully charge a battery in about an hour, while the the camera/AC adapter takes over four.  It is very nice to have that extra battery too.  Also, splurge and get a bigger cf card too, 16MB just doesn't cut it anymore. I admit, I am a camera novice.  Still, this camera will deliver the goods in full automatic mode.  The LCD is well readable in direct sunlight and the ON-TO-SHOOT time is the best I've seen.  This is a truely great little (and light) digital camera.", "Date": "February 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great price vs performance deal", "Author": "SH in Tampa \"SPH\"", "ReviewID": "R38KBXHKK5VVSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After shopping around, I found the Kodak DC 4800 to be the best price versus performance deal on a mid level digital camera.  The hi quality picture (3.1 MP), USB transfer, manual vs automatic settings and powerful lithium ion battery are usually found on much more expensive cameras.Obviously for any camera buff image quality is paramount.  The DC 4800's high resolution pictures will blow up to 8x10 easily, and even up to 11x14 with a good quality shot.  There are a large number of controls that allow the user to adjust for a particular look (saturated color, neutral color, b&w, filtered) or for unique lighting.  We found that the image quality on this camera was excellent compared to the other digital cameras that we tried out.  Some of our shots showed some aliasing (jagged lines) in compressed modes.  However, it disappeared once the images were shot in uncompressed mode (and without digital zoom).  As noted by other reviewers, getting the firmware upgrade from the kodak website is important for the quality of low light shots.Another important feature is ease of use.  The camera software is easy to install, the manual is well written and the placement of most common shot settings on a dial on top of the camera is very helpful.  I wanted simple point and shoot, which this camera easily supports.  On the other hand, my girlfriend is a commercial artist and wanted to be able to operate with manual settings on a traditional camera.  Both of us are very happy using the camera.The only negatives are lack of twain compliance, the small memory card and the long battery charging time:- TWAIN is an industry standard interface that will allow you to connect your camera directly to numerous photo imaging software packages.  This is not supported by the DC 4800 so most file transfers are a two step process. - A 16 MB compact card will only hold 10-15 images with standard compression.  ... The battery charger takes four hours.  A faster charger is available with a second battery but again it costs a little muchOverall, this was a great deal (note it pays to shop around as the price on the camera varies greatly) for a camera that will grow with your experience.  From day one, you will get great quality shots and as you become more confident, you can manually adjust many functions to produce your own look.", "Date": "March 14, 2001"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "Pamela J. Wiseman", "ReviewID": "R1W82LLMHZVVKK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have shot 35mm for decades.  A few years ago I got tired of lugging my SLR outfit around and started using good quality P&S autofocus cameras which did a generally good job but fell short in flexibility and indoor flash capabilities.  I tried out a Kodak DC 215 last Fall to see if digital was for me. I really liked the advantages of digital, but realized I needed a 3-megapixel camera to get the quality I wanted.  The DC 215 also offered no more flexibility than my P&S cameras.  I narrowed my choices to the Kodak DC 4800, the Olympus C-3000 and the Nikon Coolpix 880.  I finally bought the Kodak due to the current pricing.  I feel this is the best bargain in a 3-megapixel camera right now.The DC 4800 actually provides all the needed traditional film camera flexibility I want in a much more manageable outfit than my old SLR.  When you register the camera on the ..., they will send you a ... lens adapter free.  I plan to get the telephoto lens and with the built in zoom lens I will have nearly all the focal lengths I had with my SLR's three lenses and  2X tele-extender -  all in a form factor that fits in a fanny pack.  I downloaded the firmware version 1.04 and have had no trouble with low light focusing.  I have had excellent results with picture quality and my results continue to improve as I learn to use all of the camera's features.  There has been some criticism of the flash.  The DC 4800's flash capabilities are at least as good as my P&S cameras, which I realize is ... with faint praise, but this camera's features allow you to easily overcome this limitation.  Here's what you do: Buy an inexpensive tilt head automatic flash ( I got the Vivitar 2000, under ... at the country's largest retailer), and then purchase a flash shoe bracket that attaches to the tripod mount on the camera.  This costs ... for a straight bar or about ... for an L bracket.  If your local camera store doesn't have these, they are available on-line.  Plug the flash into the camera's flash terminal.  The extremely handy f-stop selection dial can be set to 5.6 for straight flash or 2.8 for bounce flash (I have always had better results with bounce).  One caveat: As the lens zooms in, the f-stop setting will close down somewhat - I find you can zoom 1x to 1.3 x before this happens.  Usually indoors this is not a problem as you can move closer to your subject instead of increasing the zoom.  Bottom line is I get the same flash quality and convenience as on my SLR for only a ... investment - try this on most consumer digital cameras!", "Date": "April 17, 2001"}, {"Title": "A powerful camera", "Author": "Meander \"Meander\"", "ReviewID": "RGEM3GYJJXELQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've looked at quite a few digital cameras both online and in stores, but I never found one that even comes close to the \"manual\" feel of this camera.  If you know how to take pictures, you'll really appreciate the way this camera enables you to control aspects like shutter speed that most digital cameras insist on controlling themselves.I took pictures in total darkness (with the flash of course) and they came out perfectly.  I took low-light shots with a longer shutter setting (no flash) and those came out well too.  I took action shots, still shots, light-saturated, low-light, indoor, outdoor, with people, with distant scenery, and more...  All came out as well as could be expected from any analog camera.The USB connection is fairly straight-forward though it could use a better user interface.  The battery does get drained pretty quickly, so you can't just leave the camera on as you walk around on a tour.

Having access to higher resolutions (such as 3.1 mega pixels) is is important as well, b/c you want your picture to be sharp and crisp. Ergonomics are great and your hands will feel at home when using it!  The casing feels very solid, but the two plastic doors (for connectivity and the memory card) looks like they could break at any time. Here are the functions accessible manually:  - Self-timer: to chose the moment your camera will triggers itself.  - Burst mode: to take 4 pictures in sequence (at the lowest picture quality, you can take up to 16).  - Landscape: to prevent the camera from focusing on a near subject and have the horizon in focus.  - Close-up: To let the camera adjust the focus to take a subject between 0.7-2.3 feet in great details.  - Flash and flash settings: Will let you chose between flash, no flash, red-eye  - Exposure compensation (from -2 to +2): This will let you chose to over- or underexpose your subject, to adapt to various light conditions.  - Aperture (f/8, f/5.6, f/2.8): You can decide on the depth of field, so that you can have sharpness and blurriness where you like it on your photos. You can also choose P for the automatic settings to take over.  - Zoom in/out: You get a 3x physical zoom, and also a 2x digital (which adds up to the 3x automatically when you press the zoom button long enough). You could also choose to block your camera from entering the digital zoom mode, to prevent yourself from using it (I have yet to see a photo which benefited the use of the digital zoom... they're always grainy, not only with the Kodak's digital zoom, but with all those I tried). The Kodak DC4800 comes with a 16 mb Compact Flash memory card, which is a complete nonsense for a 3.1 mega pixels camera. You should buy at least 64 MB. Amazon has great prices on this.The BAD part of the DC4800 is its inability to focus in low-light conditions. It rarely focuses on the subject but looks for any source of light and focus at that point.The main complaint with the DC4800 goes to the battery.Kodak's proprietary Li-Ion battery that's used in the DC4800 doesn't impress at all. With the LCD on, it doesn't last more than 40 pictures, after which the LCD turns itself off. Get a charger and solve your problems.

I will not waste more time repeating what others have said, except to say that the flash works as well or better than any point and shoot 35mm I have used before.  However, the flash does tend to wash out color, which you can compensate for by manually adjusting the white balance, which is excellent on this camera, or by not using a flash and taking a longer exposure.  I recommend the latter, and was very surprised at how sensitive the camera was in fairly low light.  Certainly far more sensitive than my P.O.S. film camera.  Battery life is a big issue for all dig cams, and I would say that if you do nothing to save battery life, you get about 2-3 hours of continuous use from one charge.  If you turn off the LCD and don\u00a1\u00aft use the flash, you will extend this a great deal.  I am not sure how much more life this gives you, as the battery never ran out when I did this, but it is at least four hours.  Your expectations for the battery should be similar to a laptop or a camcorder, and this battery works as well or better than most.  As for complaints about the lens cap not attaching to the camera body, you don\u00a1\u00aft have to be MacGuyver to figure out that a piece of string about 8 inches long should solve this problem. Pros:  easy use right out of the box (after 4 hours to charge the battery), excellent manual, super images, fast download to PC, image control (white balance, exposure, aperture, color saturation, uncompressed TIFF option for really high res).  Able to accommodate additional lenses with the adapter that you get free for registering the camera.  Price is a plus, esp. now with the $100 rebate.  Shop around and you can find this camera for... after rebate. Cons:  memory card is comically, if not criminally, insufficient.  At max resolution, one picture will be 9MB.  The included card is 16MB.  To state the obvious, this would give you ONE pic at max res.  Using minimal compression, files are ~2MB.  What is the point of having 3MP power if you can\u00a1\u00aft use it?  You need a bigger memory card, the EZ upgrade comes with a 64MB card and an extra battery for less than the price of the card alone.  NB, the battery charger is not included in this package.  The included software is not very good, to be kind.  It is functional if you have no alternative, but I would say that Photoeditor is far superior and Photodeluxe or photoshop are too superior to even compare.  Also, the camera software is not compatible with windows NT.  You can buy a card reader for pretty cheap to overcome this, which you might want to buy anyway to avoid always connecting/disconnecting the camera from the PC.

It takes clear, crisp images.  It offers quite a bit of creative control to the more advanced photographer.Quite frankly, short of buying a $6,000 Kodak professional digital camera, this is the best deal I found.3x optical zoom is a definite selling point.  Never believe digital zoom ratings on cameras, while they might enlarge the image, they lose clarity and sharpness.  Most other cameras out there offer 2x optical, and 3x digital.  This camera has 3x optical, and 2x digital.  A definite advantage.The Li-ion battery is an advantage and a disadvantage.  It has a nice long life, and it is certainly more environmentally friendly).  It is definitely cost effective, digital cameras eat batteries.  But, there is one problem.  It is not easy to just pick up and charge on the road.  If you plan on taking the camera away from power outlets, buy a spare battery and charger.  With regular batteries, any newstand can sell them to you.  The spare battery isn't cheap.

All I can say is these people must have gotten a lemon from the first day of the assembly line or something. I bought the 4800 and it is awesome. The autofocus on mine was the first thing that impressed me when I looked at the output. It has not occured to me it has ever made a mistake. The depth of field is impressive. The thing is laid out perfectly and fits my hand like a glove.  The low light capability is like a spy camera out of a movie. The pictures, the most important thing, which come out of this camera are very very nice.The default color choice out of the box I guess is suppose to emulate kodachrome. Sometimes it is a little too much, but the camera has a easy override which takes neutral coloration pictures when you want them. I think people and their clothes look better with the saturated color on but when you need accurate color it can be yours immediately. The zoom has a stop before it gets to the digital, it isn't that hard to detect it for me. The flash works with the auxiliary lenses which block the nikon 990.I will say that while the flash is not physically blocked with any of the auxiliary lenses, the professional quality wide angle lense is very large and does cast a shadow on wide angle shots of art work in the lower right corner from a distance of three or four feet. How many times  you use wide angle lenses in a dark room from four feet with the flash will determine how big a problems this is. The camera has such good low light capability you can, I feel, get around this.The batteries are suppose to be expensive. Why? because they allow you to shoot, with the LCD ON, 40 pictures or so without a problem. The cheap AA batteries belong on a cheap camera. This is suppose to be a nice camera and have a power system that has some oomph. It does. This camera should be about 1100 dollars with the other top prosumer cameras.

For basic point and shoot on low energy setting, it seems to do very well  with battery life.  But no matter, definitely buy an extra batter with  charger (you can get it directly from Kodak if you can't find it here).I  agree with a previous reviewer where the extended lense is visible through  the viewfinder.  I haven't received my extra lenses yet (wide angle, tele,  closeup), but I'm sure that will be even more of a problem with those.  I  suspect with lense attachments this is not uncommon.  In those cases you  may want to use the LCD screen for direct through the lense viewing  anyway.The 3.1 megapixel resolution is really, really nice.  I can't  believe I ever lived without it.  When you printout a large format image,  you can really see the difference.  This aspect of course will be true of  any 3.x MP camera.  By the way, somewhat unrelated, don't bother using the  digital zoom.  The optical one is excellent, and for digital zooming, it's  better to do the very same effect in Photoshop where you have better  control.  I just turned that effect off on my camera which is a real nice  thing to be able to do by the way.The real excitement, however, happens  when you venture into any of the manual settings.  You have really nice  control over white balance (e.g. setting Kelvins directly or adjusting  based on known lighting, or adjusting based on a white card in the image,  etc.), over color modes (sepia, B&W, several color modes), exposure  metering, ISO, exposure settings, and shutter speeds.  I think Kodak has  done a real good job with these.  It also puts some of the settings  physically on the camera so you can adjust them without going into the menu  (on the LCD screen) including f-stop, exposure compensation (handy to  quickly deal with backlight subjects), distance/closeup (which forces a  fixed focus), delayed snap, and burst mode.  The burst mode is really cool,  but I find it only interesting when using in the smallest resolution  (1080x720) where you get a burst of 16 pictures.What can I say, this is  really fun.  When my wide angle attachment arrives, I will also venture  into using this along with my kaidan attachment for VR photography.  The  software is pretty reasonable and allows full control by an attached laptop  in those professional situations where you're taking thousands of images  for a VR tour.  By the way, the included AC adapter will be a life saver in  that case too.  Also, if you really want to get exotic, Kodak makes all of  the software development kits free so you can develop your own software to  manage the camera or the resulting collection of images.

Flip it to manual and experiment a little, this camera can deliver a picture that will rival the best that 35mm can offer. Simply awesome! Also in regards to batteries, standard AA would certainly have been cheaper but can not provide the same longevity or power capabilty that a lithium can provide (How many laptops do you see running AA batteries?)With lithium batteries, this camera can process three times as fast as my DC290. Bottom line, the difference between this camera and other Kodak cameras is that this one will take a little longer to figure out and seems to be geared for the serious amateur, but is definitely worth the extra time and money.

Picture quality is great at 3 MP and even good when working at lower resolution -yes sometimes we have to go there-.  The lition-ion battery is a great feature, and makes the whole camera lighter, easier to use (you can recharge when ever you want) and one gets a lot more battery life out of these babies, than normal nickel metal hydrates. Just for interest sake on one occasion I took 90 picture, with the flash on, with one battery.

For the last 30 years, I have used a 35MM Nikon F with the FTN meter. After doing research to determine which camera I thought would fit my needs, I purchased the Kodak DC4800. Before going on my vacation, I also purchased a 128 MB flash card and the extra battery and charger. While on vacation I took 101 pictures with about a third to one half with using the flash. I then came home and downloaded the pictures into my PC 3 or four times before saving them to my hard drive. During this time, I never changed or recharged the battery and had no problems at all. As of yet I have not tried the external flash. I strictly wanted to find out what the camera by itself would do. At this point, I am very impressed with the ease of how the camera works and the ability to control all of the many settings and not have to be a programming wizard to do it. With just a little effort and playing with the buttons, you can just about figure everything out without even using the manual. This camera is very user friendly. I would also like to mention even with being very light it seems to be well constructed. This camera is easy to hold and the buttons for the different controls all seem to be just where you would want them. I did have a little problem with the focusing, but after realizing the camera needed to be set on the distance setting for almost all shots and downloading the new software off the Kodak web site this problem has been taken care of. Letting the camera program everything gives me very good results and takes all the work out of picture taking. This leaves me with just the fun aspects, frame point and shoot... It is nice that if I get into special situations though I can still take control of all the settings if I think it becomes necessary. Bottom line is it easy to use, gets great pictures, and I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.I would like to add this information that might help in purchasing this camera. At the default setting of 3.1 MP the resolution is 2160 X 1440. This is an approx. file size of 960 KB. That means you are going to get just a little over one picture per MB. So a 65MB card = 65 pictures or 128MB card = 128 pictures. I recieved a 16MB card with my camera and sixteen pictures just doesn`t get the job done. I purchased a 128MB and think this was a wise investment for me. When ordering a camera just figure about how many pictures you want to be able to take without changing cards or downloading and that will tell you what size card you need to purchase to accommodate your needs.One more thing I would like to add is that when you take a picture it is not like useing a regular camera. You push the button to take the picture half way down to set the focus and exsposure, the press it all the way down to take a picture. If you press the shutter all the way down in one complete movment your pictures will be out of focus and the exsposure will also be wrong. This is one of the few things I had to read the manual on to find out how to do correctly. Somehow I think that a lot of the problems people have (if not all) could be eliminated by spending some time learning how to use the camera correctly. It is different from a 35MM or a plain point and shoot camera. Like I mentioned in the title , this is my first digital camera after using a 35MM for 30 years and I think it works great.... YES I DID TAKE TIME TO EXSPERIMENT WITH IT before comming to my conclusion. If I had made a quick judgement before learning how the camera works I would not have rated very high.Again I would like to say that I am very pleased with this camera.

For instance, saturated color does amazing things to green-- great for outdoors shots!But the really great thing about the camera is the ability to combine automatic and manual functionality.  Instead of forcing you to choose between fully automatic and fully manual mode, instead you can choose any number of settings manually, and let the camera do the rest.  Often times I will set the f-stop, or the color scheme, or the film speed, or the sharpness, or the white balance, or any combination of those, and let the camera do the rest.  This is absolutely WONDERFUL for people (like me) who often wish to add some specific element to a photo without having to take full control of all settings.  The only exception to this is shutter speed selection-- if you choose a shutter speed, you must also choose the f-stop.  Nonetheless, Kodak's implementation of automatic and manual functionality is really slick.You won't find this many options on any other 3.1MP camera that prices for <= $600.Warning to potential buyers: buy a case, it doesn't come with one.", "Date": "June 11, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality, but battery is a headache.", "Author": "Edwin W.

According to PC World, one can take 171 pictures this way.In spite of all its pros, the battery system is designed for use near home and in North America only.  If you travel abroad, good luck finding a UL-certified step-down transformer with proper plugs and sockets.  Also, if you want to take the camera out on a moment's notice, you have to wait four hours until the battery is fully charged.

It had everything we were looking for, 3.1 MP, 3x zoom, and rechargable batteries.  Moreover, you can override the auto control and manually select the f-stop, ISO, shutter speed, color saturation, exposure, sharpness and exposure metering (center-weighted, etc...).  It even allows for you to take black and whites (with 3 filter options, none, red or yellow) and sepia photos.  It is certainly the most powerfull of the Kodak line, it is a shame they seem to be moving away from these features and going after the market share where people don't want all these options. That isn't to say that you can't just point and click... you can, it has auto-focus and auto exposure/speed controls... but I like the ability to override those, especially when I have backlighting or want to play with the focal depth.  Oh, and another rare feature is that it has a video output jack that you can run to a TV to view your pictures on.  This has come in handy when visiting friends or relatives and I wanted to show them pictures we had in our camera but didn't want to download them to a computer.  The menu system is amoung the more intuitive that I have seen.  All manual settings can be changed with just a couple button presses and I have yet to delete a picture by accident.  Some options, like f-stop and exposure control can be controled from dials on the camera without even going into any menu.  The battery is good, recently I took the camera out of town for a long weekend and forgot the battery charger.  We took pictures at many events over a few days and just barely got by before the battery ran out.  Of course, we have learned over time some tips on how to extend the battery life such as minimizing LCD viewing of pictures.  The 3x optical zoom is nice but I would prefer a little more.  I don't like the quality digital zoom provides, but fortunately there is a setup option to disable digital zoom so that you don't accidently use it.   As close to perfect as it is, there are some minor gripes.  The manual exposure control dial seems a little flimsy like it might come off one day, fortunately it is rarely used.  Second there is a little door that you open that covers the USB and battery ports that also seems a little flimbsy.  Also, the button you use to turn on/off the camera is a bit too close to the shutter button.  If someone else is taking our picture, they invariably press the wrong button unless we make it clear which button to press.  The flash is somewhat weak (although comparible to small film cameras).  Another gotcha is that you have to press the shutter button half way down to lock in the auto focus, speed and f-stop settings before pressing the button the rest of the way down to take the picture.  Although this is standard with nearly all but the most inexpensive cameras, it is something that you have to carefully explain to anyone else who you want to take a picture or the picture will likely be out of focus.  But then again, it is digital so you can look at the picture right away and determine if it needs to be re-shot.  Finally, I think that the 16 meg card is much too small for any type of vacation use.  At the highest resolution but least compressed JPG, each photo is about 700-900 kb.  We purchased an additional 64Mb card which are quite cheap now and have yet to run out of memory (and if we did we could go out and buy another from any electronics store).All in all, a great camera!!", "Date": "June 2, 2002"}, {"Title": "a few glitches, but happy overall", "Author": "Daniel Ford", "ReviewID": "R3ALXMTIVWDHCQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "P>I didn't find the camera very intuitive to use, which problem was worsened by the fact that I don't use a camera very often, so I tend to forget the solutions that worked last time.

Anyway, before that, I had the camera for about a year (I got it from a friend who had just bought a really great camera).  While this camera is no match for my new Olympus, it was quite a good camera and a good introduction for me into semi-serious digital photography.  I had a digital camera called a \"JamCam\" before this one, but it had few options and rather low picture quality (though for the price and the time when I got it, it was actually decent).The Kodak DC4800 is excellent under good lighting conditions, getting photo quality prints with a good printer.  I actually got some great indoor shots with the flash too, though you can't get to close (it will wash out the picture) or to far away (it will be to dark).  The camera can be fully automatic or almost fully manual (there is no manual focus, and the automatic settings are able to make use of more F-stops then when in manual mode).There are three focus modes: automatic (which usually works well except when dark, as there is no af assist lamp), Macro (for taking close-up shots as close as 10\") and infinity (which allows you to lock the focus at infinity, which is good for distance shots).The camera includes a 3x optical zoom which is nice. When fully zoomed out, this camera gives quite a wide field of view (the only thing on this camera which is actually better then my new camera).Unless absolutely necessary, set the ISO setting to 100, as anything above that starts to get grainy.  At 200 grain is noticeable but usually acceptable, and iso 400 is usually very grainy.The camera also includes a nice neck strap, lens cap, tripod adapter, and a time delay feature to allow you to get into the picture.  The LCD display on this camera is good except when you are in bright sunlight, and then it gets hard to see, so you might need to use the optical viewfinder in some conditions.  The camera comes with a recharger.  The batter life was just okay, but I got the camera and battery used, so a new battery probably would have been much better.  The camera also has video out cables, but the friend I bought this camera from no longer had his, so I can't comment on them.  You'll also probably want to get a larger compact flash card then the one that came with the camera.Overall, this was a great camera in its day, and if you can find it used for a good price (be sure to compare prices as new cameras that beat this one are coming down in price all the time), it is a great starter camera which usually gets pretty good pictures (I won second place at the NJ State fair photo contest (amateur division) with a photo taken by this camera a year ago).

The camera does well in remarkably little light.The zoom control has not worked on three or four occasions.  One moves the switch and nothing happens.

What a disappointment it was when the  first of three came. Yes I had three and all three were returned due to  results mainly but poor design also enetered into the decision. First it is  to small, 2nd has a lens cap that cannot be attached to the camera even  though it has two holes in the lens cap. Batteries are expensive and don't  due any more than the AA Recharable's the 290 used. Flash is a pop up flash  which is just one other thing you have to remember to activate if needed  instead of being intergrated like the 290 was. But the real bottom line is  the results -they are not as good as the 290. I had taken a week before  with the 290 pictures of my new car. I took the same picture with the 4800  and then printed both off with the Epson 900. The 290 print was far better  than the 4800 and that is not acceptable especially with a 3.1 res. I now  own a Epson 3000Z which is built along the lines of an SLR and the results  are what I expected from the 4800. The Sierra Image software included is  great.
