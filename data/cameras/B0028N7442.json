Ergonomics different from previous K10d and K20d (maybe good, maybe bad depending on your position) Insignificant change in image quality from K20d Can disable long shutter noise reduction for shots 30 seconds or less Excellent sensor dust removalWho should buy the K-7?  Anyone looking for a prosumer dSLR (Nikon d300, d300s, Canon 50d, etc) that they want to take anywhere.  This thing is for serious adventurers, with its full weather sealing and wide array of weather sealed lenses (DA* or WR series lenses).  Going on a trip to Alaska?  Hiking in the back country?  Canoeing down the Colorado?  Or even if you just want a smaller dSLR with all the features of the big boys from Canon or Nikon.  This camera steps up the competition.What new to Pentax users should be aware of?  The camera makes slight noises when you pick it up or turn it on. The sensor is free to shift in its mount due to the shake reduction system.  This is totally normal, but scares some first time users where they think something might be broken.Detailed review:I have tested out the weather seals in a driving rain, where I shot video using my DA* 60-250mm lens.  The seals held up well and the camera still works, so all is good.  Having used previous Pentax cameras, I have had minimal trouble with batteries dying in the cold like some friends with Nikon's and Canon's have.  I had my K20d out in -30 F weather for 1.5 hours once.  The camera had frosted over.The camera is diminutive, but feels like a little tank.  It is sturdily built and feels great in the hand despite the compact size.  Without the grip I only have 3 fingers on the grip, but this is the same way I held my much larger Canon 5d when I had it.  The K-7 is comfortable for me to hold for long periods, I support the camera with my pinky finger.Pentax has a stellar selection of lenses for APS-C cameras with a wide array of fixed focal length lenses (primes) for best image quality, or large aperture zooms (f/2.8), medium aperture zooms (f/4), or \"consumer\" zooms (f/3.5-5.6).  To find a list of Pentax lenses, visit Pentax Imaging USA's Website.  If you want weather sealed remember to buy WR or DA* lenses, non of the others are weather sealed.It is important to note that shake reduction works with every lens for the Pentax system, usually around 2 or 3 f-stops, but up to 4 for those with shaky hands.  This is invaluable to have a 50mm f/1.4 with shake reduction for those available light shots, just remember that shake reduction allows a slower shutter speed so it isn't ideal for moving subjects.  Also remember to wait a split second for the shake reduction icon to show in the viewfinder before taking your picture at slow shutter speeds.The ergonomics are intuitive for the K-7, but might throw some previous K20d users for a loop.  Users coming from the K-2000 (K-m in foreign markets) should be able to adapt quickly, as it is very similar.  One of the new design paradigms is quick access to everything through the info menu on the back.  Also use the info button to disable the LCD (for those that do night shooting and get blinded by it).  There is a direct ISO button now too, for those that didn't know it was hidden under the OK button before.  Typical of modern electronics there are several over-loaded button functions, so it pays to sit down with the manual and read over it, but overall it is intuitive.  The screen often shows you what button to press (like a little symbol of the front e-dial is shown to change a particular setting using that dial).  Similar to the K20d, but slightly different too.  Be sure to download the latest firmware from Pentax for better use of the AF Select mode (for selecting your own autofocus point).The video mode is reasonably good.  It uses motion JPG compression (AVI) which results in huge file sizes, but minimal artifacts while panning or during motions scenes.  It records 720p at a fast 30 frames per second, most of the competition only does 24 fps.  Max is 4 GB per file, which might be 8 minutes or so at max quality, or 30 minutes at a lower quality.  Like all dSLR video cameras the internal mic picks up every sound the camera makes, so ideally you should use an external mic for high quality video.  Only two dSLR cameras allow that at the time of this review writing, and those are the Canon 5d which is twice as expensive as the K-7, and the K-7.  The soon to be released D300s will allow an external mic too, but it has a targeted price of $500 more than the K-7.  This makes the K-7 one of the best bargains in dSLR video.The refinement of this camera is stellar.  The shutter is very quiet for a dSLR (if you are coming from a point and shoot it is of course much louder), but it is unobtrusive and professional sounding.  No more clackety clackty whirrrrr that the older K20d made, one of those noises that turned every head in the room.  It is also nice the shutter acts separately from the mirror, so mirror blackout times are minimal and the shutter can be fired multiple times without cycling the mirror, like in live view.This camera also has an extreme degree of flexibility in configuring JPG options, you can customize several different JPG modes ranging from vibrant, muted, natural, portrait, etc.  You can change the key, contrast, saturation, sharpness and more.  You can also take 3 shot HDR images right in the camera with decent results.  Finally, you can do a wide degree of image processing right in the camera using built in digital filters and also RAW developing.The composition adjustment can be used to make small shifts left and right and rotationally using live view mode.  These are very handy for fine tuning the composition and are equivalent to shifting on a tilt shift lens (just to a lesser degree, 1mm each direction).  The level is also handy, allowing you to easily see when the camera is not perfectly straight, or it can be set to automatically level the horizon.So, I have had a pretty glowing review so far, what are the downsides?I have shot 2000 shots through the K-7 now, and it has performed as expected.  I have charged the battery maybe 3 times, so life is reasonably good, except when using live view or video mode frequently.  The camera sometimes thinks the battery is going dead when it is low and turns the camera off.  You can still shoot pictures if you turn it back on, but not much video or live view.  However, you can still get a lot of use from the video or live view before this becomes an issue, and if it does you might invest in a battery grip or AC adapter.My only disappointment with the camera is I wish ISO 1600 performed half a stop better.  The noise is relatively pleasing though, and will lead to good prints or black and white conversions.This camera has an intimidating array of buttons and options.  If you are a beginner, and have no intent to learn photography in terms of exposure and aperture, I would hesitate buying this camera.  Pentax's entry K-2000 might be worth a look in that case.However, this camera really brings everything to the table and if you are an advanced consumer or even a professional looking for a feature rich camera, this Pentax is definitely worth a look.  This camera is an amazing price considering the competition.", "Date": "August 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "In a word, superb", "Author": "Michael McKee \"mystic cowboy\"", "ReviewID": "R1RCSJ9KJJ3IUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every once in a while I get a product that is \"just right\". The first VW Rabbit, a Taylor Guitar, a couple of my many Macs and my Klipsch speakers come to mind. They have that extra something that makes me love them. Other brands may be as good but these products click. Add the K-7 to that short list.I couldn't believe that I bought this as I already own the very good Pentax K20D. The K-7 is a better camera. As the current have-to-have feature is video, Pentax included that with this camera. Not being that knowledgeable about video, it seems like it does a good job, though it isn't a quick, push one button action.But when it comes to still photos, it is superb. It feels good in the hand. It's noticeably smaller than the K20D and a bit lighter but don't make the mistake of thinking that small doesn't mean hefty. This thing is solid. It' build like a tank. I believe that the steel and magnesium body is tough. It sure feels that way.Pentax has taken a good camera and fixed the little niggling problems that kept the K20D from being great. The slow, low light autofocus is fixed. That's fast and accurate now. The already decent high ISO performance seems to be about a full stop better. The camera now has a dedicated ISO button, too, which is a much appreciated addition.Other little touches shine, too. The camera handles like a dream. It's well balanced with my not very light lenses. The 4 way controller now has separate buttons, that let you access the functions individually. Excellent. The ISO button and exposure compensation buttons have been moved to the top of the camera where they can be easily found by feel. The review button, also has been moved to the top and doesn't have to be picked out of a cluttered back.Oh, and the photos this takes are excellent. It has a bunch of scene modes and effects, which honestly I haven't used. I shoot RAW, though Pentax has left their exclusive RAW/JPEG button on the front of the camera if you choose to mix your image formats. I already mentioned the improved low light performance. High ISO noise doesn't really appear until 800 and then it's not something that detracts from the quality of the images. It actually produces usable images at 3200 ISO. They are grainier than some other cameras but Pentax applies very little noise control and the photos have more detail than other cameras I've tried. I like the balance that Pentax has taken.One other nice detail is that Pentax has replaced the fiddly key you need to turn to access the SD card with a simple latched door. It's still weather sealed. The one place where the camera seems just a bit worse is in the media door on the other side of the camera. The solid door has been replace by a rubbery plug that I'm not fond of. It still seems to seal the camera but it feels cheap, the only part of the camera that isn't top-top.One other area that's been improved is the burst speed. I honestly don't believe that the slower rate of the K20D was really a problem for most people but the numbers didn't look as good as the competition. That's \"fixed\" with a 5+ frame per second rate. It just shows that Pentax really paid attention to what people said about the K20D and fixed it. Pentax also added a high dynamic range feature that does a pretty good job. That has two ranges. The high one shows that HDR strangeness that I've come to expect. The middle range does a pretty good job, though I still like to bracket the exposure and post process. Though I did use it this afternoon and got a decent exposure.For a serious amateur, I can't image a better camera. Go to a camera store and pick one up. I'm guessing that you'll like this gem, too.**Addendum - I just spent the last week with my new macro lens. The new ability to zoom in with live view makes manual focusing easy to get spot on. And manual focus is necessary with extreme close ups.A problem with all DSLRs is that the lack of the split screen built into the old film cameras makes manual focusing less precise than it was with them. There really are no models that I know of that don't suffer from this. Live view zoom solves this.(you can add a focusing screen but I understand that those mess with metering)", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Major upgrade!", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R2Z9LIYVZGA4GN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had owned a Pentax K10d and have been wanting to upgrade for a while. I did extensive research on the Canon T1I, Canon Xsi, Nikon D90, and Nikon D5000.Pentax K7 won out in the end. I was willing to change systems, but the K7 is simply superior to everything at and below its price range. Even surpasses the ones that are a few hundred more as well.I travel a lot and wanted something light and weatherproof. during the P&S; days, I ruined 3-4 cameras because of dust and did NOT want that to happen to a more expensive dslr. Pentax came to the rescue and offers a weather sealed body. So I can take photos where there's lots of dust and even in the rain! what other slr camera can you do that with? The Pentax K7 is the only camera within hundreds of dollars that can meet this criteria.Of course having great image quality and autofocus abilities were critical too.  Yeah, the Nikon D90 might have great low iso performance, but it's a toy compared to the Pentax K7. Canons were nice, but they felt like toys... unless you go into the $1500+ range. the tight body of the k7 is a sheer delight.I got immensely frustrated by Canon and Nikon because I really wanted to switch over... mainly because so many of my friends have their lenses and I could borrow them... but I couldn't do it because Canon and Nikon deliberately trip their cameras so that it doesn't cannibalize their other cameras. Also, they want to make more money by putting in the stabilization within the lens instead of the body. So you have to get a stabilized lens - which is a lot of more money. Pentax ain't nasty like Nikon and Canon. They put their best foot forward instead of little toes like Canon and Nikon with their stripped cameras.admittedly, one of the major problems with my K10 was the low light autofocus. it was hard to take shots with my 1.4 prime in a dimly lit room. but that problem is now gone! the k7 autofocus is quick and accurate. an additional bonus... one of the reasons why i hate flash is because it disturbs the people around you, but the loud shutter sounds of slrs are a distraction too. but with the k7, i think it has the quietest shutter of all slrs! this is a huge bonus when trying to take pictures without disturbing people around you.all the cameras that aren't full frame are similar in image quality. some have more noise and more detail (like the pentax), and the others have less noise but less detail, but the differences aren't very significant. so it comes down to the value and the feature set. and this is where the Pentax K7 BLOWS away the competition. you might be a little turned off by the $1300 price, but at that price, there's NOTHING that comes even close.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "K-7 \"Noisy\" Improvement Over the K20", "Author": "P. VANDALEN", "ReviewID": "R2TXMK4Z5UOZV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Starting with the impressive Pentax K10 a few years ago, I later welcomed the arrival of the K20 for improvements over a very capable camera.  The K20`s 14.6mp CMOS sensor provided much improved high ISO performance so that shooting at ISO 2000 for concert photos was no problem.  The individual lens adjustment for auto focus was also a huge plus since lenses that were barely usable on the K10 due to front or back focus problems functioned normally on the K20.  I even found that the live view feature was pretty handy for such things as sunrise or sunset pictures where it would be impossible to look through the viewfinder without damaging your eyes.  What remained a bit of a disappointment on the K20, however, was the often slow and inaccurate auto focus, the slow burst rate and the finicky white balance performance that much of the time needed constant fiddling to get close to accurate hues under various lighting conditions.  There was also the anticipation that high ISO performance would be improved as well.  Knowing the K20 limitations, I could usually work around them and still get impressive shots.  But there's always the expectation of improvement, especially when you start bumping into those limitations and seeing how the competition is moving ahead of what you're shooting with.So when the K-7 was suddenly announced, I had hopes for another measureable step forward to answer to the shortcomings of the K20.  The first feature that caught my attention was not the HD video capability at 30fps, but rather the entirely new 14.6mp sensor \"built from the ground up\" with the intention of improving high ISO performance, especially in shadow details, as Pentax claimed.  Additionally, there was the new 5.2 fps burst rate and improved autofocus performance.  That was all I needed to buy the K-7.  You can read about all the improvements this camera represents in the other reviews from those who also bought the K-7, so I'll keep my comments to those things specific to my experience after a month shooting thousands of JPEG pictures (no, I haven't played with RAW yet, and I understand that's where the K-7 really does well).Pros:The new smaller size is not what I would have liked.  I actually was hoping for a slight increase in the size of the K20 since I just like the feel of a larger camera.  However, the solid construction and layout when combined with the optional battery grip made for a satisfying package for comfortable handling.  I also like the battery option of standard Pentax K-7 battery or 6 AA batteries in the grip. Without the battery grip, the small size does have advantages for portability/storage, however.The auto white balance improvement over the K20 is huge!  Even under various artificial lighting conditions, the white balance is surprisingly accurate.  This will save me many hours of post-edit work just to adjust the color balance as I did with my indoor K20 shots.The new shutter is much quieter and smoother.  I never really cared for the shutter sounds of the K10 and K20 compared to Canon, Nikon and others.  Although still not as smooth and \"precise\" sounding as other cameras, I can live with the K-7 shutter noise.  In fact, the quietness is a big plus for taking candid shots when you don't want to draw attention to yourself.The 5.2 fps burst rate is a substantial improvement from 3 fps for action shots and is still workable compared to the faster rate of other cameras in the 6 to 8 fps range.The autofocus performance does seem to be improved, although the type of lens you use can make a big difference in focusing speed.  I've found that in bright light the fastest focusing lenses are the ones not using the quiet SDM mechanism in the lens, but rather the noisy screw drive in the camera body, although these lenses tend to have less focus travel, helping with focusing speed.  I've noticed less \"back-and-forth\" indecision in focusing with the K-7 in low light situations, but the overall speed is probably average amongst the various DSLR makes.  The AF assist light is also a nice addition that helps in near-dark situations.  Update: A leading photo magazine just tested the K-7 auto focus speed, and compared to their test of the K20, the K-7 looks to be almost 10% faster in all light conditions - according to their tests.  That same magazine also tested cameras like the Canon 50D and Nikon D300s where they were about 50% to over 100% faster than the K-7 in medium to low light conditions.  Hands-on experience still shows that the Pentax autofocus system is far slower than the competition in lower/low light situations. This can be very frustrating when focus response slows significantly or continues to hunt back and forth while your one or two second photo opportunity has passed before the camera could finally achieve focus and get the shot.  In bright light, however, the K-7 and the others are all about the same in focus speed.Cons:I'm most disappointed with the performance of the new sensor.  Throughout my picture-taking with this camera, I noticed an overall tendency for my shots to be just a bit \"noisier\" than the K20 at all ISO settings.  After careful JPEG comparisons between my K20 and the K-7 at ISO 2000 using the same lens and same settings, I found that the K-7 had slightly more \"grain\" than the K20.  This was especially noticeable in shadows - which is where the biggest improvement was supposed to be.  The K20 sensor would best the K-7 at all comparable ISO noise reduction settings with the exception of the highest NR setting.  Detail would certainly be reduced in both cameras at that setting, but the K-7 does seem to show more detail despite the increased noise reduction.  The only thing I noticed is that the increased detail, or resolution, is accompanied by harsher edge detail like over-sharpening or the way watercolors can bleed along an edge.  These issues considered, I would have been no less disappointed if the K-7 had come with the K20 sensor so long as the auto white balance improvement came with it. Not clear what the story is behind the K-7 sensor development (by Samsung) unless it somehow didn't quite measure up to what Pentax was expecting in time for the launch date of this new camera.Despite the greatly improved auto white balance, I found that the K-7 still has a bit of a problem rendering red such as red lighting or red colors in stage performance situations.  They end up looking a bit washed-out and pinkish.I remain concerned about Pentax quality control.  The first copy I did most of my shooting with turned out to have a \"noisy\" flexible back that squeaked and creaked near the buttons and thumb rest.  Amazon was spectacular in getting me a replacement in a couple days.  The new K-7 is solid - very solid, but I've noticed that pictures on this copy are slightly underexposed.  I've been told that there have been some other copies purchased with the same flexible rear body issue.Forgot to mention the little issue with the SD card door:  the card is way too close to the door hinge when it's open such that I can barely get my fingers on the card to pull it out.  I almost resorted to needle nose pliers to do the job.Overall:The K-7 is still a worthy improvement over the K20 despite the disappointing \"non-improvement\" in ISO performance: for me the K20 now becomes a solid backup camera to the K-7.  The multitude of features and improvement of the menu and controls and the overall quality of the pictures it can produce, hold up well to competitors in the same general class resulting in a really fine camera choice and better deal in the balance.  Mounted with the best Pentax glass, I feel just as capable standing next to the pros shooting with high-end APS-C class Canons or Nikons - the resulting pictures speak for themselves.  With the K-7, Pentax is a high-value option for serious enthusiasts.Update 9/23:  The 2nd copy I received turned out to have an apparent defective sensor/light metering system - or very odd normal behavior.  At all ISO settings above 1250, the image (JPEG and RAW) is underexposed by at least one full stop.  A \"problem\" of underexposure with the K-7 is covered in more than one professional review but Pentax says that they are not aware of such issues - so this may be isolated.  Looking back at pictures taken with my first copy, it also appears the problem existed to some degree with that one as well.  As a result, I'm personally not confident in the integrity of the new sensor/metering system on the K-7 (and certainly not in the quality control) and will wait until next year before possibly trying my luck with a third copy.  In summary, I feel the K-7 needs some serious improvement with the sensor, autofocus system and quality control to better compete with the likes of the 7D and D300s and be a truly outstanding camera as a result.  Looking forward to seeing these improvements on their updated K-7 model in the hopefully not-to-distant future.  For now I'll continue to enjoy my still capable K20.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best DSLR value for the money", "Author": "M. Catlin \"Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R30AINPYBFLTG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background: I have been doing photography for 30 + years and digital photography since about 1997. I  own or have owned Pentax ist*D, and K20D. I also have a Fuji S2Pro (Modified Nikon body), and Sony A100, A700. I have briefly used several modern Canon and Nikon DSLRs. I purchased the K7 for a 3 week trip to England and Ireland, mainly because I didn't want to lug around a DSLR and a video camera (Sony HDR-HC1). I bought the Tamron 17-50mm f2.8 and did the trip with that single lens - only about 10% of time did I desire a longer focal length lens.Pros:Solid. I dropped it 3 feet onto concrete (camera bag hung on something). The lens hood shattered but the camera and lens worked perfectly.Compact and weather resistant -- feels good and soaking rains of Ireland did no harm.Great Auto White Balance - even in low light and indoors; Fuji S2Pro is close on AWB but most other DSLRs really struggle with low indoor and mixed lightingFast (relatively)-- about same as Sony A700 (5fps).Fast and significantly improved focusing (versus K20D) especially in low light.Better low light performance, focusing, color balance, noise.Improved anti-shake is a significant aid in low light - didn't need tripod. Remember, unlike Nikon and Canon the antishake is in the body so it works with all lens and this makes the lens cheaper.Adjustable Noise Reduction. Very good low-light performance, best under ISO800 but acceptable to ISO 1200.Tilt-meter that really helps, really needed on video but great for most photosControls: buttons for most important functions. In particular the push-button RAW button, exposure compensation, and ISO.Unique Pentax exposure modes: Sensitivity priority #set the ISO for the lighting and it will pick aperture and shutters speeds for correct exposure and TAV where you set the shutter and aperture and it will change the ISO to get the correct exposure.Customizable -- every comprehensible way. There are a million little things (Lateral Chromatic aberration distortion adjustment, HDR capture, digital filters, bracketing options (unbelievable#, autoface detection.Quality of photos is excellent particularly with a good lens.Cons:Not a video camera. Need to be careful about focusing. Focusing is a slow, one-time thing for each shot. It is hard to verify focus on screen (can't use viewfinder) particularly in bright light. One can't pan or zoom well. You get best results if you don't move the camera - just let the activity in the frame create the action. In the same way that video cameras aren't replacemets for DSLRs for still photos - DSLRs are not replacements for video cameras - not yet anyway. That said, you can get good looking video if you are careful.  Video eats up SD card space fast - tell your story with short 5-10 second clips.There is so much that can be done with this camera that it can easily intimidate -- just leave it in \"green mode\" until you are comfortable.I have trouble getting the SD card out of the camera - it seems to hang and I end up pushing it in and letting it spring out multiple times.Why doesn't Pentax use Compact Flash Cards? For the money they are cheaper, faster, and hold more. It would be nice to have 2 card slots and then this would be a true professional body.Bottom line:I believe the material/build, features and quality of the results make this the best DSLR camera value today.

I've had it for just a few hours and have found that the autofocus is indeed much superior to the K20D - nearly instantaneous in most cases.  It works at low light levels, too.  The other thing that one notices early on is the superior resolution of the LCD monitor over the K20D.  On these two points alone, I'm happy with the purchase.

It is much improved in every aspect, and is finally the pro quality Pentax I have been waiting for. The build quality is fantastic, and I love the size. It goes perfectly with the Limited lenses, and is a package that is small enough to take with you everywhere. The autofocus is in a different league compared to all other Pentax cameras I have owned in the past. This cannot be overstated, it is THE upgrade pentax needed to compete. The auto white balance is also much improved, and is very accurate now. The battery life is excellent so far, however I don't use the Live View function or video, so I don't know the effect that will have on battery life.

To get accurate color the white balance had to be set manually every time I used the K-10, with the K-7 I have yet to be disappointed with the results when it is set to auto white balance. The more compact body is remarkably well made and a delight to use. The faster frame rate, while not the fastest in it's class, is a huge step forward and is easily more than fast enough for my purposes. The shutter is so quiet that I am consistently amazed by how smooth the process of taking a picture is each time I press the shutter button. I bought the 18-55 lens as well simply for the capability it gives me to shoot in inclement weather.The camera's menu is so complete that although I felt comfortable with the previous Pentax menu, I initially had a bit of a learning curve as I now have much more control over the entire process. The screen is another huge step forward and has a great viewing angle. I still think Pentax should have an articulating LCD, but this one works about as well as I can imagine any stationary LCD working.About the only thing about the camera that I don't like is the high ISO performance. I knew about that going in and strongly considered the K-x or K-r. While I would love to have their great ISO performance at ISO 6400 and beyond, the refinement of the rest of the camera convinces me that the K-7 was the appropriate choice for me.If I could have afforded the K-5 I might have gone that direction, but at its' present price point, the K-7 was the perfect compromise that didn't feel all that much like a compromise. As a serious amateur photographer, I am extremely well pleased with the K-7. When you consider it's price I still believe it's the perfect camera for me. There simply isn't another camera out there with this balance of body quality, weather sealing, performance and picture quality at this price point.01-07-2011  While high ISO will never be the K-7's forte, I noticed a significant improvement when I started shooting RAW.

I have worked as a journalistic photographer for about a decade.  During that time, I have mainly used Nikon equipment (N90, F4s, D70, D90).  I didn't expect to buy a Pentax when I started looking for a personal camera system.Several factors won me over:1.  The K-7 is small, tough and weather-sealed.  I take more pictures of more interesting things if I'm not either worried about hurting a fragile mechanism or environmental factors such as rain or temperature.  I also take more pictures if my camera isn't so large that it is a pain to bring with me.  The K-7 does very well on both of these fronts.  It is significantly more compact than a D90 (much less a Canon 60D), and built a lot better as well.2.  The K-7 benefits from a great line of lenses. The new Pentax \"Limited\" lenses are small, beautifully constructed and take great images.  The K-7 is also fully compatible with used SMC-A manual focus lenses (which Pentax made in the 70s and 80s).  They are available at very reasonable prices on Ebay, greatly expanding your options of you are on a budget.3.  The K-7 has in-body image stabilization. This means that the photos you take with every lens (not just newly constructed \"VR\" lenses) benefit from the stabilization system.  For me, this has meant sharp images at significantly slower shutter speeds.4.  The K-7 is cheap.  At at least $300 less than a D7000 and $600(!) less than a K-5, this camera is a bargain right now.  Use that money to buy a lens or two that you can still be taking pictures with decades from now.This is not to say there isn't a trade-off1.  The K-7 should not be your first choice if you absolutely have to have the best quality images at ISOs over 800.  While the K-7 still takes nicer images at 3200 than I could ever get on actual film (TMX 3200 for those that remember such things), there are a lot better choices out there for high ISO/low noise applications.  ISO 100-400 is great, 800 is still pretty good.  1600 is usable, but starting to show some real noise, and the only place I would actually use 3200 at the moment is shooting a night sporting event for newsprint.To put things in perspective, the K-7's sensor isn't great by contemporary standards, but still beats the pants off of a D70, or probably any camera produced before 2007.  So, if your current DSLR is more than four years old, you'll probably be pleased so long as you're not the type that stays up nights worrying about the fact that somewhere, something technically better is out there.All and all, I think this is a great value, with one trade-off.

It is weathersealed, something that Canon only offers in their professional series, and Nikon at the D300 level, all of which cost substantially more. And it has in-body image stabilization, making all your lenses potentially hand-holdable, where others need a tripod. The image quality is on par with every other offering in this sensor size, with some ups in one area, some downs in another.Lenses are far fewer than with the Canon/Nikon families, but what is available is all good quality, not cheap leftovers from the film era. The only lack is very long telephoto lenses such as 500, 600mm, for those one has to buy either used, or third party, like Sigma. (Pentax actually may make a 600mm F4 on special order, at a price similar to Canikon)Controls are good and thoughtful, menus are well arranged, again, there is not a whole lot of difference in quality among brands, but certainly in personal preference.I do have dual systems, using a Canon 1DIII with long and/or fast lenses for sports and action, while taking the Pentax for everyday and travel photography, having been displeased with Canon's prosumer offerings (50D, 5D Mark II) because of their lack of robustness primarily, their added weight and in the case of the 5DII, insufficient improvement of image quality to offset the slowness of the camera and above listed drawbacks.)I have used the camera for some sports photography, and tested the AF system, and find it more than adequate.

It's the smallest of the \"pro\" or \"pro-sumer\" level cameras available. My hand almost began looking for a film wind lever! The view finder was also the best of the bunch! It was large, clear, bright and gave me a 100% view.Although I use a hand held incident light meter most of the time, I found the New internal metering system to be almost as accurate. All reflective light meters are error prone and must be interpolated. The white balance is \"spot on\"!I always shoot in the RAW+jpg mode. When I open images in photoshop RAW the white balance eyedropper has practically no effect! Amazing!The build quality of this camera is spectacular! You feel it the instant you pick it up! The control placement is perfect! The top LCD is indespensible and illuminated. The new 920k rear LCD is simply beautiful! I like to shoot wildlife on the California coast with a manual focus 600mm f8 mirror lens. I focus exclusively with the LCD in \"live view\"! It's sooo cool! I mount the lens, the camera instantly asks me what focal length, I enter 600mm, push the live view button and away I go! I can focus with or without glasses in daylight! I can use all my old Pentax lenses! I Love it! There's even an electronic level built in that is viewable in both LCD's! AND! The shake reduction works with any lens! This is what turned me off to Canon and Nikon with their lens based shake reduction!I've taken many indoor and outoor shots so far using the wireless flash. All I can say is: \"wow\"! I've taken quite a few macro shots with my Pentax 100mm f2.8 macro lens, the K-7 and my AF360FGZ strobe.

It is very logically and intuitively laid out. It has an excellent index and appendix! Take the time to \"set up\" your K-7 the way you like to shoot and you will not be disappointed!

I also did not what to mortgage my house to get a Canon or Nikon, etc. Pentax K7 is all weather sealed and built like a tank (magnesium alloy over stainless steal frame) as others have described it. It takes magnificent images. Canon and Nikon users including individuals (some experts) who should give an unbiased opinion of cameras always seem to find something negative about Pentax products, usually related to higher noise levels(it's all about knowing your piece of equipment from top to bottom). Well personally Canon leaves a too smooth almost plastic effect to images leaving out desired detail. I've seen the experts' testing and I have to tell you I don't see any reasonable justification for saying Canon/Nikon are your better bets. Sure if you want to pay twice as much and maybe still not get weather sealing go ahead, but the results (the images won't be better unless you go way up in price to professional models, full frame types. The K7 is an outstanding camera and maybe with all its features a step ahead of the rest in it's class. I'm not going to put down Canon, Nikon or the rest. They're great camera companies with many loyal adherents. Maybe because Pentax hesitated in getting into the digital race for what ever mistaken reason, these other companies have a larger following.

I never paid much attention to the K7 when it came on the market.

So I will dispense with all the technical specs and details because there are numerous reviewers who provide that type of review.

One thing you must know is Pentax is one of the very few companies who make in-body stabilized DSLR's and used the same mount since film, allowing all current 3rd party lenses and manual lenses from 30 years ago to work on this body and still maintain optical stabilization. Huge advantage for Pentax over it's competitors, but sadly the world is brainwashed by what they see in Best Buy and the advertisements.Pentax builds cameras for photographers and hobbyists at the best of their ability. Pentax does not create 3 DSLRs in the same class, pricing them one over another after stripping features. Pentax are a loyal company to their loyal consumers; you will never see them screw their consumers over by producing a bunch of half-baked bodies and advertise them as everything. They make one DSLR for entry-level and one DSLR for semi-pro and putting all they have to offer for a more than reasonable price.Aside from the quality of Pentax's craftsmanship throughout the years, the superb build quality of the K-7 is not to be forgotten, that over 50 years of producing some of the finest film SLR's and DSLR's, all of that innovation and time spent have been put into creating this masterpiece. 77 weather-seals making it resistant to dust, rain, and cold temperatures, this is truly the most powerful Pentax ever built to date.Sometimes the best just don't get talked about, in fact most of the best things in life don't get talked about.

I replaced the K20D with this K7 for one, main reason - size and shape. The K7 fits amazingly well in your hands. I am so confident carrying it that I almost never use a strap. I even walk up to a mile or two around my neighborhood holding they camera with one hand without any concern for dropping it. I loved the K20D, but the size of the K7 called to me. This is the main reason I like Pentax bodies and glass - high quality, but physically smaller than the other guys. I don't want to carry around a 5D Mark II with L glass. It's ridiculous.So beyond size and form factor, the following things are important to me when considering my everyday use of the K7.1) The K7 has a 100% viewfinder (vs. typical 96%). I can't believe models more than twice it's price don't have the same 100% offering.2) Secondary small LCD screen on top of the camera. This is a must have for any serious-amateur-slash-semi-pro photographer.3) Build quality and size - my K7 is smaller than any camera in it's prosumer class. It's built of a single piece of magnesium alloy and has 72 water/wind/dust-proofing seals. I can shoot in a downpour without worry. Many of the Pentax lenses I use are also coated with a weatherproofing agent.4) Dedicated ISO, white balance and exposure compensation buttons are also on par with other prosumer cameras in its class.5) Fast frame rates - my K7 is 5.3 fps I believe - helps capture the right image when shooting candids, etc. People's expressions change a lot in the course of a second.6) 920,000 dot back LCD screen for high quality on-screen viewing of photos.7) Finally, this is nit-picky, but I like the little locking mechanism on the mode dial on my K7.

Simply email Pentax a request for the extended warranty and they will mail out a card for you to fill out. There is no indication or notice of it in the packaging, but they are offering it.As you probably know, this is Pentax's new 'top of the line' camera.  Its no 1D mkIV or a D3X, but its a very good prosumer camera, and the price is right when you pair it with excellent lenses.Here's what I like a lot: it really \"just works\" as far as allowing you to adjust the settings you want without slowing you down.  I'm still getting used to the layout, but most important functions are adjustable with the press of a button and the twist of a dial.The build quality also feels very good, and it is a nice piece of equipment to hold in your hand.  While the K7 is the smallest \"prosumer\" camera (much smaller than the EOS 50D or 7D, or even Pentax's own K20D) I don't feel like the camera is cramped.  I would like it if all four of my fingers fit on the grip, but its not uncomfortable to work with in this package (and you can get a grip to fill it out, if you're dying for that.)The basics like the viewfinder and LCD are great, the K7 has a very clear and large viewfinder- Its probably as good as you'll find on any prosumer camera.  The rear LCD is bright and clear and its easy to tell if you've got the shot, you can also have the LCD display a histogram and other info.  Live view is very handy, though I like it more for tripod work.  Couple that with the \"sensor adjust\" feature that allows you to tweak the actual position of the sensor so you're shots are perfectly composed, and it makes tripod work even more inviting. The viewfinder and LCD are something you use 98% of the time so its good that Pentax got them right.The amount of image tweaking you can do is very nice, and you can read all about that in the massive 300 page manual that comes with the camera. The camera responds very quickly.  I have read a review that said that they felt that it was \"a step slow\" but I have no idea what they are referring to.  If you are constantly reviewing and jumping from the viewfinder to the LCD you may catch a delay or something, but I'd much rather focus on shooting now and reviewing later.  As for the core functions(the act of getting proper exposure, locking on focus and clicking the shutter button) this thing is incredibly responsive and I have never felt held back by the technology in my hands.  The shutter is like a whisper compared to the clunks and clicks of other cameras, especially if you use a high quality lens with weather seals that really locks in the sound.  I kind of miss the \"click\" sound, but this is much less distracting for the subject.  The frame rate is plenty fast for me, I'm sure only the most demanding sports shooters will wish for faster shooting.  Autofocus is nice and accurate, the focus assist beam seems to do a decent job in low light situations with my DA* lens attached.The one thing that slows down the camera is shooting in video. When you switch to video mode, it takes a good second or two to flip the mirror up and open the sensor. Then there's a split second delay between pressing the shutter and the start of recording and finally after you're done recording, there is a good delay (complete with hourglass) as it processes the video and saves it. The video looks and sounds very good for a camera at this price, but its not the quick response of a dedicated video camera.If it were up to me, I would have traded the \"Sv\"(ISO priority) and TAv (\"Hyper program\") mode off the mode selecter dial and just created 3 \"custom\" profiles.  To be fair, the camera saves your specific settings for each mode on the dial, as well as the one USER mode that you can set on the dial. But I would rather just be able to create each profile from scratch (again, just a preference, not a negative).I hope more people turn to Pentax, when they realize the price to quality, this is an excellent choice.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Value for Money", "Author": "M.

Actually, it's fun to learn, but the back and forth nearly drives me crazy in my quest for obtaining the best purchase for me.  With that being said, I'm sure anything I would have bought would have worked just fine, however, I am very pleased with my new K-7, and would not trade it for anything.The menus and sub-menus can take a while to become familiar with, and the included manual is thorough, but can throw enough info at you for it all to run together.  Never fear; The autofocus mode works very well, and navigating on your own is easy enough to learn the camera.  In addition, there is an after-market book on the K-7 I found very helpful.  It would be great for Pentax to offer a DVD manual (they could make some money off of this, or someone else could), which I would watch because I hate instructions written by a Japanese person and then translated to English.I use my new camera for my job, and thus far (knock on wood or a high-quality fake wood veneer), the K-7 has worked out great.  Could I have bought a less expensive camera that took great shots?  Absolutely, and Pentax offers a K-X that appears to be a nice value, as do several other manufacturers.  What sold me was the build quality in that I can use this outside in any weather thanks to the sturdy frame and weathersealing.  I also like the fact the kit lens is actually quite good, and that saved me another $500 - $1,000 off the bat.  However, I will be investing in lens upgrades down the road.  The camera is also compact, yet isn't too overly cute, where ergonomics are compromised.A few things:1.)  I'm not an expert, and don't need my ego validated by pretending I know everything about DSLRs2.)  I've probably skipped a few things you were hoping to read about in my review and are mad I talked about knocking on wood or a manual instead of mirror lockup3.)  Despite my overall ignorance and inexperience with serious photography, you don't have to go buy a cheap point and shoot just because you don't walk around with a portfolio of all the supermodels you've shot (not with a gun, by the way).  It's important to enjoy your hobby/profession/semi-profession with the equipment that serves your complete needs.  As I mentioned above, I could have gotten by with a less-expensive camera, but for a high-quality semi-professional DSLR with more features than faults, this, in my opinion, is an excellent value and takes great photos.If you are on the fence about which camera to buy, and this happens to be in your price range, you will be hard pressed to find a camera in this class at this price, unless you go to a company's website and purchase a refurb or model that will soon be discontinued.  Just remember this:  Buying a professional or semi-professional camera will not make you an instant pro, and with today's technology, amazing photos can be taken with just about anything.  On the flip side, don't skip on something because you don't think you have the skill-set or don't have time to learn, because regardless of all the features, menus, etc....your bio-mechanics take over, and spending enough time with anything (manual or not) will make you familiar with it.  There are DVDs, classes, books and even boredom, where you take your camera out and start pressing buttons and turning knobs because there's nothing else to do.  You don't have to go all out, yet you don't want to cheap out either.

This also can ease your budget quite a bit, since you can pick up superb manual primes for under 60 dollars.

Over and over again, I think, wow, this is a camera that was designed for photographers by photographers--button placement, menus, custom functions---everything is thoughtfully put together, unlike some other cameras you feel are just cranked out.  The K-7 is a hidden gem.PROS:- Very high quality build (the camera feels tight and tanklike, solid like no other camera in its price range)- Weathersealing (not offered by any other camera in this price range, as far as I know)- Perfect control placement: dials and wheels are thoughtfully placed to be at your fingertips (front and back control wheels are rare at this price range)- Very quiet shutter: it makes more of a shuffle sound than a \"clack\"; along with its compact size, this camera can stay very discreet (good for impromptu shots, nature shots)- Unusual \"Sensitivity Mode\" that allows you to force the aperture and shutter speed, so that the camera attains the correct exposure by changing ISO (only Pentax has this feature as far as I'm aware)- Excellent viewfinder (100% coverage) and good, well laid out LCD panel.- Excellent picture quality (especially in RAW): unlike other cameras that artificially saturate the images, the K-7 keeps tones neutral and ready for post processing- 5 frames per second, with good buffer- 38 custom functions that let you decide how the camera operates- Green button: allows you to experiment with exposure settings (using command dials) and then \"reset\" to camera's metered reading, in one push of button (very convenient!)- Straightforward menu designCONS:- Movie mode is OK, but shutter speed is fixed, limiting exposure options; highest resolution is an oddball not quite 1080p resolution (though camera does 720p just fine).- The SD card is fiddly to remove- There's only one SD slot (not 2 as on other semi-pro or pro cameras)- AF \"point selection\" knob is stiff and hard to move (but I almost never move it).- For practical purposes, 1600 is the maximum usable ISO; a color shift occurs when boosting to 3200 (though this is of course correctable in Photoshop).  The K-5 significantly improves on this limitation.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Much improved from the K10d (and I love the K10d).....", "Author": "Marcus Panek \"Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "RBD8AMPNTZP1V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The image quality is definitely noticeably improved from the k10d.  I typically only use ISO 100, but I still notice a big difference in the noise, much less on the k7.  I can only compare this camera to the k10d as that is what I own.  Some of the pro features I mention below may be in the k20d, but for that, I cannot say.Big pros compared to the K10d:The live view: This is a huge help if you are using manual focus lenses like the M's and A's.  You can zoom in 8x on the live view and get the focus spot on.  It is like a viewfinder magnifier, but way better since it is 8x and since it is not just zoomed at the center of the frame, you can move the view around with the arrows.IR remote in Bulb Mode: On the K10d, you had to use the wired remote to lock the shutter open in Bulb mode.  On the k7, you can select in the custom menu for the shutter to be locked with one press of the shutter, then stop the exposure with a second press to the shutter.  This was a common sense thing that I always wondered why the k10d did not have that capability.One touch bracketing: Another common sense thing that was not capable with the k10d.  In the custom menu you can set it up where if you have selected exposure bracketing (which I do most of the time), then you can hit the shutter once, and it will cycle through all the bracketed exposures that you have selected (either 3 or 5).  This is a huge plus for me.  Again, on the k10d I had to use the wired remote and lock the shutter for it to cycle through the bracketed exposures one after the other.  Now it seems, with this feature and the bulb feature, I can't see myself even needing the wired remote anymore, which will save me some time.Composition option: Haven't really messed with this one yet, but the ability to move the composition around a little bit (it uses the shake reduction system) without having to move the camera is a plus, especially when using a tripod.Lens correction for da lenses: again, haven't tested this in detail to see how well it works, but if it does, this is pretty nice, if it helps reduce chromatic aberration.  It definitely does not get rid of chromatic aberration, but it does reduce it.  I kind of wish the camera would let you `de-fish' the fish eye lens, but the zoom fisheye is exempt from the `distortion correction' option.Image Finishing Tone:  This is a cool feature that allows you to adjust the image finishing tone, even when shooting RAW, which is all I shoot.  Big plus.  I know some may say you can apply this in post processing, but many times you can't get it to look the same.  Also many times you are taking a picture thinking it would look good in black and white, but then forget to convert it in post processing.  This allows you to shoot it in black and white (with color filters), so you don't forget later.  However, the black and white will not show up in Lightroom, but if you bring it into the included Pentax software it will.  That is a downside to it.  Make sure to download the newest firmware for the camera, this adds the `reverse film' finishing tone option which gives a nice warm tone to pics.Small cons:The size:  I know you can't please everyone, and the majority of people think the smaller the camera the better, but if you have big hands, you will definitely want the grip.  I feel my hands cramping on this one when I hold it for a while, without the grip.  I had the grip on the k10d, which is a bigger body overall, so the size is a huge shock to my hand.  I ordered the grip right away after holding it for a bit.Multifocus points:  if you are using the focusing option where you select from the 11 focus points, you have to hit the `ok' button before moving the focus around.  On the k10d you could move them around from the get-go without pressing the `ok' button.  I understand they had to do that now that they made the directional arrows, also menu keys.  UPDATE TO THIS: There is actually a custom menu option where you can reverse this.  You can set the default for the arrows to move the focus point without hitting the ok button.  Then, when you hit the ok button you select the menu options each of those arrows point to.  I started getting used to hitting the ok button before moving the focal point, now I have to train myself not to do that!Extra step for exposure bracketing and shake reduction:  Before you could do these options without going into any menus, now you have to go into the info menu to select/deselect these.  I figured the best way around this for me is just saving my most typical settings in the USER menu.  I set my user menu to have exposure bracketing x5, shake reduction off (I use a tripod most of the time), aperture priority... which I will use about 95% of the time, so not a big deal if you are like me and have a setting you use that frequently that you can save in the USER menu.It seems like there is some common issues with the rear edial on this camera for some people.  They vary, and the latest firmware update was supposed to fix some of those issues.  However, the first one I received when I moved the rear edial to the left it would sometimes decrease my aperture value and sometimes increase it, so it was not working correctly. (it did the same thing when using it to zoom in and out on a photo, it would zoom in a little, then zoom out a little).  FYI, this one is not a grip issue as it did it with the grip connected and disconnected, and I had the latest firmware.  So I sent that one back to Amazon.  The new one seems to be working fine, although I haven't shot a ton with it, but I will be this weekend.In closing, a big step up from the k10d, but I cannot speak to if it is a big step up from the k20d.  They should be releasing the k5 here pretty soon so you may want to wait for that one, or hit that perfect window right after it is released and get the k7 for cheap.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "pentax k7", "Author": "W.

Starting with the K-100 then the K-10 to the K-20 and now to the K-7.  I still have and use the K-10 and K-20 and have been very satisfied with the  picture quality from both of them. The picture quality of the K-7 is noticeably softer than either of these two.  I've done numerous comparison tests with the three cameras using the same settings and the same lenses on tripod and in all tests the K-7 images are inferior or, at best, sometimes equal to the other two cameras.  In an album the K-7 pictures always stand out as just not being as sharp as the other pictures from the other cameras.I've been in touch with the Pentax service people by email and all they could offer is that I make sure the camera is set on factory default settings for best results.Noise is also greater with this camera than in the other two but for some reason that does not disappoint me as much as the image softness.  The images are definitely fuzzier than with the older cameras.I love the construction of this camera and the smaller size is a plus for me. But all in all I wish I had not purchased it and at the full opening day price, too.11/27/09Here I am a few days later and to be fair, I want to report my latest evaluation. I've taken the advice of both the Pentax service people and the folks who were good enough to comment on this review.  From the Pentax advice I've gone back to the default settings.  From the comments to this review, I've shot both RAW and JPEG.I've done some more testing pitting the K-7 vs the K-10 with two lenses, the 40mm limited and a Tamron 18-250mm. I shot the same scenes with RAW and JPEG using both lenses and compared the results.  With this many variables it hard to get consistant results but I must say I'm a lot happier with the K-7 now.  In RAW it is just as good as the K-10 in RAW.  And I found out that the lens makes a big difference.  Both cameras are equal with the 40mm limited lens in both JPEG and RAW.  With the Tamron lens, the K-7 doesn't do well.  I'm assuming that the AF  needs some adjustment within the camera which can be done but I haven't taken the time.In conclusion, I find that for best results, don't stray too far from the factory default settings.  Trying to add a lot of sharpness adjustment to JPEG images just seems to make them worse.  For better pictures shoot in RAW.  I don't know if my next statement makes sense because I have virtually no experience with RAW but the K-7 RAW images seem to have a lot less noise in them, too.And finally I would like to raise my rating of this camera from 2 stars to 4 stars.

I got mine(body only) for a tad above $800 including shipping. Although not as cheap as the K-x which retails for just $500 nowadays but compared to a Canon 550D&7D or Nikon D90&D300S;, this camera is really a great value. Plus I can keep using my K-mount lenses.I also do wish that the automatic lens correction for CA and distortion would also be available for my non-Pentax lenses but I think it will be too much to ask for Pentax to make the K7 also support those 3rd party lenses.Definitely going to do more trips now to try out the new camera.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "K10D -> K7D meh...Consider the k20d", "Author": "mandraketeck", "ReviewID": "R35S14A1U0B4B6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Though I feel that the k7 is an adequate replacement for the k10d I had, I think it's a mostly mediocre product and value given that the k20d can be had for half the price.There are a few features that I think make the k7d better than the k20d:Better autofocus.Better auto WB.100% view finder.Electronic leveling.Beautiful LCD screen.Faster FPSCool retro pentax neck-strap mounts.No one will fess up to whether or not the k7d is supposed to replace the k20d.  Maybe that's because it's at best a lateral hop.  The image quality on the k7 is the same or worse than the k20d.  On High ISO images, the k7d fares worse with noise than the k20d in most situations.  Of the four people I know who have shot pentax, only 1 of them liked the new grip and body size.  I don't particularly like the grip myself but some may find it as an improvement given it's got a smaller overall body size.  Button placement is off at times and the left justified lcd on the back is brutal.  Your thumb is always on the LCD and the left side buttons are a lot less accessible.Biggest cons for me:Left Justified LCD screenImage quality and noise.  It's not terrible, but lets face it, it's an issue.Selective AF point selection is now more or less a menu option instead of direct camera interface.Pentax did away with tethering.I have higher expectations than most.  Don't take my review too harshly.  The Pentax k7 is a decent camera when comparing value of the K7 vs Nikon or Canon per dollar.  Unfortunately, the biggest competitor to the K7 is the k20d which frankly is half the cost and offers most of the same features I want in a digital camera.Given that the $600 extra dollars I paid I view as an early adopter tax, I'm keeping the k7 and selling the k10d.  But you should really think about the fact that you can almost buy a k20d + DA* 16-50 for the same price as the k7.", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "I wish a lot of other cameras performed this well!", "Author": "Edward G.

But, that doesn't make this anything else than a great camera. I have never used a Canon or Nikon. My track record is a Pentax SuperA from the 80ies, and most recently a Pentax *ist DL. Moving up from up from the istDL was quite a leap, and you quickly realize the differences in weight and construction. But the K7 still doesnt feel too big. It appears to be quite smaller than the recent Pentax top model, K20.As far as functions go, it seems to have everything you would ever need. I mostly shoot with aperture priority, or full manual when I use my old non-automtic lenses. See, that's the beauty of Pentax, and the reason I would never switch system, it has full backwards compability, lenswise.So, does it work?I took my camera for a ski trip recently. I had no issues about taking it along in the slopes. It seems so sturdy and well built, that even if I would have a fall or two, it wouldnt affect the camera (I was more afraid I would break my back if I fell on the camera). And what if it would fall in the snow? It claims to be pretty weather proof, so no worries there either (even though I didnt make a big dive with the camera).But what I did get to try out, was the battery life, in sub freeze temperature. The battery showed no sign of use after two full days in -10 celsius. And in the evening I had the camera standing outside taking interval pictures for 4hours, in -15 degrees celsius.This is a new camera, with a new battery, so guess it should be good. But compared to what I have been used to, this is great.Also the focus seemed to work quite well. We did some action photography, ski jumping etc. And many of them were spot on (some not, but that was more caused by a stupid idea of locking focus, but with too low field of depth).Also, the video quality is excellentSo, there you go. If you want a review with pixel tests and number crushing, go to dpreview, or wherever.Most cameras in this category today, have all the features and qualitys you need - in the end it's all about some sort of personal preference.

I rarely buy something and upgrade that quickly but in this case it made sense for my situation which includes getting serious about actually being more of a professional.  That said I have had the K-7 for 2 weeks now and am quite pleased with just a few exceptions which is why I gave 4 stars.  As so many other reviews note, what you get for the money in comparison to Canikon is amazing.  The thing is built like a tank.  It is hard to imagine needing more for any reason.  It is unfortunate that Pentax does not get more attention especially by those who are not professionals or professionals  with a limited budget.  The one thing that has not been mentioned much in other reviews is the more limited availablity of lenses and accessories which probably the biggest reason Pentax does not get more attention by professionals.  It is near impossible to rent a Pentax lens and the variety offered by Pentax is limited compared to Canon and Nikon.  What they do make though typically gets very good reviews and I have been very happy with all the Pentax glass I have purchased.  Just know that the world does revolve around Canon and Nikon before committing.  I have no regrets about being a Pentaxian.  It makes you feel a bit rebellious!So here are my thoughts after 2 weeks of use:PROS:*  Excellent build*  Feels great in your hand.*  Menus are user friendly (but also see the Cons)*  Faster auto focus than the 200D and better in low light*  100% viewfinder (I really appreciate seeing what I am getting)*  Settings you are most likely to change on the fly can be done mechanicallyCONS*  My biggest disappointment so far is that the exposure sensor does not seem to do a good job of handling situations with strong light contrast. For a camera at this level of sophistication, I would expect thesensor to be smart enough to do a better job of correctly exposing the subject even if the subject is in shadows and there is stronger light in the background.I have found that by overexposing, I can correct that but still...  I would like to compare a Canon or Nikon in the same situation.  I need to do some more experimenting.*  Something nobody else has mentioned is the need to push a button on the program dial before you can move it.  To me that is overkill and a bit of a pain.  The 200D did not have itand not once did I accidentally change the setting.*  Pentax threw in the kitchen sink in terms of the cameras capabilities, and therein lies the problem.  While more can be good, it isn't always.  There is so much available that to me would not be used by folksbuying a camera at this price point,,,,for instance all the in camera editing you can do.  The capability is nice, but will I use it?  No.  I shoot everything in RAW and upload to a computer to do all the editing. Soin my opinion the menus would be more easily navigated if what was included made sense for this level of camera.  I would have preferred they kept some of the auto exposure modes instead but in the end it is not a big deal.For the price, the camera is stellar.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Value", "Author": "Jerry M. Nichols", "ReviewID": "R2SYY60Y8QFGUJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a previous Canon (S3 IS superzoom) and Nikon (SLR) owner, I wanted to upgrade to a DSLR. I did have a Pentax ME Super years ago, but I had the impression that Pentax was fading as a competitive brand. So I did a lot of research and, for the money I had budgeted, it all pointed to the K-7. I was a little hesitant about plunking down this much money on an unconventional choice (thinking market share here) like this, but I went ahead anyway, and now I'm very pleased with the K-7. The customization it allows and the build quality are excellent, and so far the picture quality and effectiveness of some of the many options are just great! Equivalent cameras from big name manufacturers are also good, but the K-7 deserves a look by anyone considering a high end DSLR who doesn't have an unlimited budget. There's no reason in my view to automatically go for a Canon or a Nikon when you have this alternative to consider.A big plus here is the relatively small size of the K-7 compared to its closest competitors. I really like the way this camera feels and also the layout of the controls. One thing I especially like is the use of mechanical controls for some of the most frequently used options. I don't like hunting through menus in the heat of battle. The K-7 has easily reached mechanical settings for exposure metering, autofocus, ISO, and exposure compensation. The weather resistant design is also a plus.My only negative would be an almost bewildering selection of options and settings as well as in some cases the varying routes to get to them. As in bloatware, sometimes additional features can have diminishing returns (although some of what I consider bloat could just be my technicall inexperience). The camera has quite a learning curve, but then again, like a feature heavy word processing program, you'll probably hone in on the relatively few features that you'll be using most of the time, so in my book this is a relatively minor complaint.Highly recommended.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pentax k7 Great!", "Author": "Amer \"Milanovic\"", "ReviewID": "R2L144V8VZDSMC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, i would like to state that i haven't had enough time to fully test this camera, but i have owned it for about 4 months.

If you are looking for technical information about this camera this is not the reveiw to read. Photography is a new hobby for me. I've always admired well-taken photographs, but am just starting, and just understanding how to shoot using something other than the auto focus function; so, I stated, this is not the reveiw to read if you're looking for anything more than a personal and lay opinion.With that said, however, I do know a good picture when I see one!  And this is exactly what I see when I use the K7. I've only had this camera for a few weeks. I upgraded from the K 20D which was also a relatively new camera for me (had it for 6 months). What I like about the K7 is that it's lighter, can withstand rain and dust and it seems to take a clearer pic (which is saying a lot because the K 20D also took great pics).The only aspect of the camera Pentax could have done a better job on is the \"door\" to where you insert the computer cable. It's made of rubber as opposed to the same hard material the body of the camera is made out of. I worry that it may not be a durable at the hard exterior of the K 20D, but I guess only time will tell.So, if you're looking to take great pictures(whether you're a novice, like me, or not)I think you will like this camera. Heaven knows I have A LOT to learn about how to work it, but until I do, I'm still able to take and enjoy great pics; and the idea of learning how to take AWESOME pics (based on technique) is exciting. At least I know I won't have to upgrade when I get to that point.I love taking pics of flowers. I recently showed some that I had developed and everyone thought they were postcards! And, this was shooting in autofocus mode! The color and clarity were amazing. You could see the smallest of details!As I wrap this up, I'd like to let everyone know that you can take photography lessons through Ritz Cameras (I hope I can say this). I looked high and low for classes from anyone (other than on-line) without success. Then I found out how, for about $70 you can take about 6 different classes at various Ritz locations. These are great for people new to photography. Unfortunately, they spend a tad bit too much time pushing their services, but for a little over $10 a class  you do walk away with basic, yet useful information.So, YES! Get this camera.

Tried to get as much data as possible to compare it from the two D300S and 7d but I found the K7 at an advantage in certain aspects such as; in camera editing which really makes you feel you have a photo software editing the pics. Secondly the video I find better in quality though I would admit the 300S has auto focus function that almost got me deciding for it. Thirdly the frustrating concept with Nikon and Canon having their point and shoot with functions to have image stabilization and would not have the concept of putting it in their DSLR. I know for a fact it is a big lost for them loosisng VR and IS add on on the price of their lenses.  That is where Pentax shines having that ability to have image stabilization function not only on still shots but also on video mode which I don't think either Canon or Nikon could do with their DSLR. Pentax lenses are great also got a 16-55mm f2.8 and 50-135mm f2.8 that would probably cost me atleast more than twice the values in a Canon or Nikon lens. With the VR2 lenses coming out they don't seem to have any plans of considering image stabilization in their DSLR. If that would be the case with Nion and Canon I would rather invest my money in other aspects of digital photography.  I did have some initial doubts if the K7 could truely be as good as it compares to 7D and 300S. As to my suprise I am really impressed eventhough I had other DSLR of Nikon I was so amazed with what this camera has in the  menu, ability to control editing of pics, the size and weight that could be a plus to small hands but with a battery grip I don't have any problem at all. Even impressed with actual battery grip which has very good feel and ability to store card and where  I have the covers of receptor also in the grip. Wish the remote could fit inside but not possible.  Not to mention weatherproofing the DSLR. I haven't have to put it to try but I know my K7 could stand it.

Now compare that to the Canon 50d with a five star rating of 69% while the Nikon D90 had a 75% five star rating.  What this means to me is that the Pentax is holding its own with the giants.  This also could mean that no matter what brand you buy you could get a lemon.  This could be true with any brand.  I own the K-10, K-20, and K-7.

Or wait until the next model comes out and make sure you know what you are buying.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "An extremely overpriced camera", "Author": "Cornelius Fortinbras III \"fabled\"", "ReviewID": "RT0BPSU42YT46", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After inordinate amounts of research, I ordered and used the K7 on a shoot and was greatly disappointed, primarily because of the qc and the sensor's obvious malfunction.So I guess I got a bad one, but that doesn't excuse anything, nor does it relate to some of the other issues.It would overheat all the time, resulting in video shut down, more noise in the images, and lines through the stills. Bad sensor.The Pentax is built well, one of the most solid constructed slrs available, but so what? For this price it should be solid and that is really the only impressive thing about it.It takes very neutral pictures, which can be good. It has some nice tweaker features, in camera control of many parameters, but in the age of photoshop, who cares, give me a nice clean neautral photo, I'll tweak it later.It's video is almost useless. The 720p is functional, but like I said the sensor overheats very easily, and unpredictably. It also is a moire pattern beast. Stay away from roof tops, patterned clothing or window screens, lest you want moire hell. The full frame video has horrible interlace jaggies, so don't even bother. You have to be in paranoid mode to make use of it, meaning, only plan on shooting ten seconds-twenty seconds max, or you might have a shut down in mid shot.The stills are nothing special, no matter what your setting. Honestly my nearly three year old Sony 350 takes just as good stills and that cost $600. That extra money cannot be justified by limited video capabilities.I guess I was somewhat biased by my partner who was shooting with a Canon T1, which cost $700 less and had a crappy kit lens yet it put the Pentax to shame in lowlight. And come on, the ability to shoot in available light is really what makes a digital camera. A $200 point and shoot can shoot good pictures in sunlight. Yes the larger sensors and lens choice are just as important...but my Sony cost $600 not $1500.Slrs need to be able to produce good pictures in low light and the Pentax has no excuses.We kidded that the t1 is an x-ray camera. It shot in near complete darkness, with a fast shutter and virtually no noise. The results looked like it was shot at magic hour.On the same exact settings, the equivalent on the Pentax, mine were dark, extremely grainy, out of focus and embarrassing. And I have a faster lens.Oh and the t1 shoots better video.The Pentax also has the worst auto mode for those get-it-fast-or-it's-gone situations.So if the Pentax cannot even stand up to a camera costing $700 (what am I getting for that money, better build?) than forget it.Pentax is basically the turtle in the SLR race, but here slow, steady, and more expensive doesn't win the race.If you are going to  take pictures of still life or landscapes (daytime) and have time to adjust, tweak, fine tune etc, because honestly what dslr works the same way as a film camera, and you want a tank on your tripod, then get the Pentax, otherwise looks elsewhere.Canon and less so Nikon have rightfully left Pentax in the dust of the digital realm.check out the finished video from the shoot and see for yourself.[...]", "Date": "October 17, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,099.95", "Features": "High-resolution, 14.6-megapixel CMOS sensor; compact, magnesium alloy body\nBody only; lenses sold separately\nWeather resistant, dustproof, and coldproof (14 degrees F, -10 degrees C)\nFast 5.2 fps shooting with the new PRIME II Image processing engine; top shutter speed of 1/8000 sec freezes even the fastest action in well-lit settings\n3-inch LCD; Live View mode, with contrast AF, Face Detection, and optional histogram, grid, and bright/dark area display\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Pentax K-7 14.6 MP Digital SLR with Shake Reduction and 720p HD Video (Body Only)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51l3w6fZauL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0028N7442"}}
