When I pinned them out I found the following:Cat5 Pin 1 - video (BNC Inside) +Cat5 Pin 2 - video (BNC Outside \\ ground) -Cat5 Pin 3 - Audio (RCA Inside) +Cat5 Pin 4 - Power (Inside) +  <-- there are two power in and power out, only one is needed for a 12v camera.Cat5 Pin 5 - Power (Inside) +  <-- there are two power in and power out, only one is needed for a 12v camera.Cat5 Pin 6 - Audio (RCA Outside \\ Ground) -Cat5 Pin 7 - Power (Outside \\ Ground) -  <-- there are two power in and power out, only one is needed for a 12v camera.Cat5 Pin 8 - Power (Outside \\ Ground) -  <-- there are two power in and power out, only one is needed for a 12v camera.To make two cameras work over one Cat5e for this setup I used only video and power, and used only 1 of the inside and out side power. (see my customer images for the physical diagrams.)I terminated two ends to the single CAt5e on each end of the cable, (4 ends total on the cable) then plugged two of the balun's into the cable giving me the ability to use two cameras over 1 wire.To do this I used the blue pair 1 and 2, the orange pair on 5 and 8, then repeated for the second camera with green on 1 and 2 and brown on 5 and 8.All around the product is better and less expensive than other Balun's have I have used.  They were easy to work with and despite their size I was able to fit two of them into 1 single gang box for my dual camera over 1 Cat5e cable setup.Enjoy.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "VideoSecu CCTV Security Camera Video Audio balun...", "Author": "Johnie lester", "ReviewID": "R13AW4SS61GZ7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased video baluns that look like these from another company at a much higher price ($35.00).

So, I don't see this as a problem, or if your camera has an on-body BNC connector, a short BNC cable plus a BNC-TO-BNC female adapter will cheaply solve the problem.I like this product!", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Work Like Magic", "Author": "Anarchy", "ReviewID": "R33D14VZU868UY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These baluns work well with CAT5e to send power to an analog camera and receive the data (picture).  One is made for the DVR connection (BNC connection) and one for the camera connection  The power comes from a wall wart (plug into the wall).

They are an adapter for guys who want to use CAT5 instead of coaxial cable (RG59).  On the camera end they need to be in a water-proof box.

Prior, i had bought some 100 foot BNC/Power cables and i had some go bad and got tired of replacing them. They were cheaply made, but regardless, I wanted something better.These are Cat6 Compatible, which is what I used.  Many reviewers are stating they are getting 200 and 300 foot runs, and I just wanted to shed some light on how that may or may not be true in your case. There are many factors including Camera wattage, and cable wire gauges that will determine your overall max distance. I have done the research and tested it and I highly doubt you could get 1000 feet with a cat5 as its listed in the description.Cat6 has a wire gauge between 22-24. I used belkin high performance Cat6 on my install, which comes with 23 gauge wiring. The Balun uses 2 pairs of wiring for power, which is necessary to carry the power load across it.  In my case, a pair of 23 gauge wires is almost exactly the same size as a 20 gauge wire. (.0226\" diameter wire doubled nets a .032\" Diameter which is the spec of a 20 gauge wire).The reason the above is important is due to the fact that these cameras run on 12v. 12v requires a large wire to carry the current over long distances.  My cameras are CCD's and use 24 IR LEDS and are more power hungry than normal (4 watts each), which is why I opted for Cat6. To be exact, factoring in a reasonable 10% voltage drop, using the balum on a 1:1 ration (no modification to split the wire to run 2 cameras) with a 23 Gauge Cat6 cable will go a maximum of 180 Feet on a 4 Watt camera and only 90 Feet on a 4 Watt camera using only 1 pair of wires for power.  My longest runs are about 80 feet, which allows for no more than a 4.5% voltage drop, which is excellent for CCD cameras, which are touchy on voltage drops. The picture quality is night and day from my old cables.The reviewers that used Cat5 cables (Cat5 is typically between 24-26 gauge wiring), best case scenario (a 24 gauge Cat5e cable), these balums would only reach, about 142 Feet on a 4 Watt camera, and 71 Feet if you only use 1 pair of wires for power on a 4 Watt Camera and maintain no more than a 10% voltage drop. (It would be 70Feet/35Feet if you wanted no more than a 5% voltage drop).This is just a little more technical overview of the capabilities of the wire, and of course there are more factors such as wire quality, not just the gauge.  But it\u2019s a general idea of why im sure some people have issues with the balums.  Just know that, you will be able to go 30% farther with the same quality with a Cat6, and know the limitations of splitting the cable to run more than 1 camera.Im not sure what Wattage other cameras pull, but for example, a 2 Watt camera, you could double all distance I wrote above. A 3 Watt camera you would multiply the distances by 1.5, etc\u2026 Or even the opposite way. An 8 watt camera you would divide all the distances by 2.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works as promised...audio not tested yet.", "Author": "Tommy_Boy", "ReviewID": "R39W9AAOYU5A46", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These work great, but haven't tested the audio yet.
