{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This Camera Does It All!", "Author": "sevenzeroseven", "ReviewID": "R37H67FQYVY0C6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hardly ever write product reviews - just restaurants. I am making an exception for this camera!I waited quite some time to get a Leica. Some of the comments in one of the thread questions that are going on right now are insane. I am sure some of you agree...we can go on comparing products over and over until we die, so why not make some of these comparisons based off what the people have to say that actually own the item, not from just reading the nonsense people have to say when they haven't even touched the product.Well, with that being said...so maybe some of us want the little red Leica logo on the camera, or some of us just don't care. I am in the middle. I like Leica and their technology. Their design is clean and simple, and since this is my first time owning a Leica - I am proud to show the logo.The V-Lux 40 is an amazing little machine. I sold my Nikon D90 with three lenses, so I could buy this camera. When I found out that the zoom is better than the Nikon 70-300mm lens I had [that cost $650, whole Leica cost $700] - I couldn't help myself to find out how and why this compact point & shoot camera could do all this and more. I live in New York, and I love taking photos of buildings and architecture - the zoom is unbelievable! I am getting specific detail on beautiful old buildings with a BETTER range than the DSLR. When they say 20x optical zoom - that is what it means - and it means it adds up to 480mm.To be honest - I would've never bought the V-Lux 40 if I wasn't able to test it out first. I was able to do so by visiting the Leica Gallery here in NYC. I was able to try all the options and learn as much as I could by having a very informational specialist help me do so.Before I decided to part ways with my D90, I wanted to make sure that the Leica had a good macro option. Taking close-up photos is one of the most important parts of photography for me. I like to shoot flowers and bugs and zoom in on anything I can to grab detail. Taking photos of the leaves in autumn is something I have been doing for many years now, so you can see why I need a camera with a good macro.The shutter is quick and precise, and the vibration stabilizer is phenomenal. The camera moves slightly all on its own to try and find the perfect lineup for you to shoot your shot. There is GPS - I never thought I would want to use anything with GPS integration, but living in NYC - it is actually a good idea...it makes it a great way to keep note of where you have been. Another really fun feature is that you can take a photo with the touchscreen! Yup - just like using an iPhone or alike.I will say this - I have only had the camera for a week, and it is odd walking around the city without the bulky DSLR. I do miss my Nikon, but in time I will get used to not having it around. It is bittersweet because the Nikon was/is a great camera, but the Leica does everything and more than the D90 does.I have not tested the video out, since I am not really into taking video, but I am quite confident that there won't be any complaints coming from me when I do get around to trying it out.To sum all the options up right here for you in a review may be helpful:  + Improved 14.1MP CMOS Sensor  + 3.0\" Touchscreen LCD Display  + 20x Leica DC Vario-Elmar Zoom Lens  + Increased AF Speed--0.1 Second  + Optical Image Stabilization  + 1920x1080 AVCHD Video, Can Save in MP4  + 3D Photo Capture  + Shoot Up to 10 fps at Full Resolution  + GPS, DVD With Detailed Maps  + Photoshop Elements/Premiere Elements IncIf you do decide on purchasing the V-Lux 40, I hope you will be very happy with it! I know I am, and until the day Nikon or Canon make a significant improvement in their DSLR cameras in the price range I am comfortable in - I am perfectly fine and happy with this beautiful, little piece of technology.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "P&S; vs DSLR", "Author": "Captmklk", "ReviewID": "R2RPKA13XFPJ71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got my wife a v-lux 40 and I agree that it is a phenomenal piece of equipment, far and away the best point and shoot I have ever seen. It has feature not found on any other! BUT a point and shoot will never replace a dslr! Never! If you are a professional photographer you need the viewing feature of TTL. In my work I shoot Nikons. I wish I could afford the Leica S2 dslr, but at $23,000.00 for the body alone, it's not really feasible  for me at this point. For the typical snapshot needs a P&S; makes perfect sense. Carrying a big bulky DSLR is almost like having a baby with you. They are heavy and cumbersome but they serve a very specific purpose. You don't need a sledge hammer to drive a tack, but on the other hand ya can't drive a spike with a tack hammer.

Unfortunately Leica did not fulfill my expectations to stand behind their product and provide good service and warranty.I purchased this back in June (3 months ago).. have taken it everywhere, taken excellent pictures, unfortunately a couple of weeks ago I had a little incident with it at the office. The camera dropped from about a ft and half height onto carpeted floor, and the lens metal casing was bent, to an extent that the shutter would not close completely, this did not limit the lens from extending or withdrawing and its funcionalities. Finally got the shutter to shut completely but the dent was still there. Having paid close to 700 for this device, i figure the minor dent could be fixed either under warranty or not. So I decided to send it in to the repair ni NJ. There they told me that it could not be fixed and that the warranty did not cover it and it was voided due to impact. Instead they offered to sell me another, new (probably refurbished) camera at a discount (about 20% discount). I thought this was quite the rip off.. so told them no. Now, I am left with an expensive camera 3 months old and no warranty.Being a Leica, German manufactured and engineered (actually Japanese) I thought this camera would handle such minor fall better. I recently gave my mom my old Power Shot S90 that I had for over 2 years, and that was really a sturdy built device.. Next time I am sticking to the Japanese and/or making my purchases with American Express and their purchase protection.. I bought this with the Amazon Card, but Amazon played clueless as well, directing me to the seller (A&B; Imports Ltd) and to the manufacturer.
