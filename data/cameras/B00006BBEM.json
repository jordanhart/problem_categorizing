If you want to know what it was like to take a picture in 1906 instead of 2006, buy this camera.What it does do:1.  It takes pictures (sometimes...when it feels like it.)2.  It turns on and off (again, sometimes...when it feels like it.)3.  You can look at the pictures after you take them (well, you get a rough idea what they look like, because the screen isn't very clear.)4.  Use up batteries like you wouldn't believe (the other reviewer was doing good with 24 pictures--I'm lucky I can take 5 pictures without it dying on me.6.  You can download them to a computer and look at them (this is the best functioning part of the camera.)What it doesn't do:1.  Take pictures of anything in motion--and when I mean motion, I'm talking about the slightest of twinges.  If your subject or the person taking the picture aren't perfectly still, the picture will turn out blurry.  Whatever you do, don't drink anything containing caffeine for 24 hours before using this camera.2.  Your subject has to stay perfectly still for about 3 seconds because that's how long it takes for the stupid camera to take a picture.  Now, you may be thinking...3 seconds, that's nothing.  Well, if you have children, 3 seconds is an eternity.  The last time I've used the camera was when I wanted to take a picture of my two little girls.  Fifteen tries later (along with 2 battery changes) I finally got a half decent picture.  So obviously, if you have children or pets, this camera is an exercise in futility & frustration.3.  It doesn't go off every time you press the button.  You have to press the button extremely hard and then wonder for the requisite 3 seconds if it's going to work this time.4.  It doesn't turn on every time you flip the on/off switch.  If you flip the switch a little too hard, the camera will shut itself off again.  If the camera turns on after 3 tries, then it's doing good.5.  If your background doesn't have megawatts of light, or is lit from the wrong area, your picture will turn out dark.  Look forward to several minutes of playing 'musical lights' before you can get your picture to be clear enough.I know $100 is very inexpensive for a digital camera, but this thing is so bad that I can't imagine paying that much for it.  (My camera was a gift from my in-laws.  They got it free after buying their HP computer.)  Let's just say I'm glad neither I or they paid for it and I feel sorry for anyone who did.  If you're in the market for a cheap digital camera, avoid this one like it has the bird flu.  You'll save yourself a ton of frustration.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "HP Kills Batteries, Dead.", "Author": "M. Daneker", "ReviewID": "R26HPMFJTMSOWR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not only does this cammera suck a pair of AA's dead in 24 photos (or about 15 minutes of video screen) but the cheep plastic hinge breaks easy under the spring pressure. The photos are okay but not great. The flash is nearly useless unless in pitch dark and the zoom only works with the video screen wich eats battery power fast.Stay away, I have a new cannon and it's great.", "Date": "February 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Battery Guzzler", "Author": "MaroonKitty1", "ReviewID": "R27EQ6KQ69SM7O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This thing went after batteries with a vengence! I even went out and purchased those super-juiced 'digital' batteries and was able to take about 5 pictures before it finished off the brand-new batteries. It does take pictures (for the most part...sometimes for no reason at all, it doesn't take pictures) but they are not clear on the viewing screen and the zoom makes for grainy pictures. It was terrible taking outdoor pictures if the sun shined at all... It washed out every image. This camera caused me no end of misery and I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "May 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Chancy camera", "Author": "Dylan", "ReviewID": "R1KKY1N080I167", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had to stick with this camera for a LONG TIME. A couple years ago when it first came out my dad bought this as a gift for my mom, and she loved it. About a year later is just sat there collecting dust so I practically took it. What I found, like mentioned, is EVERYTHING on the camera is chancy. Sometimes it won't turn on, sometimes it freezes up, and heck..sometimes it'll turn on and take pictures on it's own! Also was only able to take about 3 pictures after FOUR BRAND NEW SPANKING batteries were placed in it. Sorry, but if any camera needs FOUR batteries it must be good, but this thing basically wastes the 5 bucks on batteries and gives you 3 worthless shots. ABSOLUTELY NOT A CAMERA FOR BEGINNERS. When anyone gets a new camera they want to test it out in different lightings, setting, etc., this one doesn't really have any settings and when you only get a few minutes you'd better shoot now and hope it comes out right! I had to take this on my trip to Florida, and I ended up spending about 40 bucks for a memory card for the sucker and super juiced up rechargeable camera batteries. This thing is so big and lunky, and crappy, that I could barely get any pictures! Taking it to the beach? Ha yeah right, probably wouldn't even last two seconds before my arm would hurt and i'd throw it in the ocean. I have to admit though, at times you CAN get excellent professional photos out of this thing, but i've only had it happen about 3 times, don't even ask me how I did it because all I did was point and shoot and it came out looking great. One last thing..it also breaks EASILY. All other cameras, and even flimsy phones etc. for that matter, can be dropped a hundred times and never break. This thing dropped ONCE and split in half, shooting my batteries to who knows where and almost breaking the week old memory card I just bought. My cousin had dropped it, felt so bad he gave me his canon power shot a410 I think it's called. It's about half of what the hp photosmart cost, but about 100 times better in every aspect. Overall..don't buy this camera. It's just too outdated and odd to really find any use of it.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "la raz\u00f3n del tiempo", "Author": "German A.

En ese tiempo costaba la cuarta parte que la Nikon top de su tiempo (4 megapixeles).Todos los comentarios que indican hoy son ciertos, pero desde las exigencias de hoy.

Comprar soporte y lentes de dc pro para ampliar el rango de imagen, filtrar la luz y tener un mejor zoom optico.3.
