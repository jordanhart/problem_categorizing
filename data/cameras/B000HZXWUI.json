{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice Microscope!!", "Author": "David Ramos Jr. \"Dee\"", "ReviewID": "R2WG7DM8VWN5M0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After checking out a few other USB microscopes I had ordered a microscope reasonably priced and looked to be quality. After receiving it, the microscope would not display an image on my Mac and turned out to be a dud, others had complained of the same thing. THAT was not THIS microscope!! This microscope was also reasonably priced and is of great quality. The LEDs dim with a brightness dial and the microscope zooms in extremely well. I would recommend this microscope to Mac users for sure. It comes with its own Mac program but can easily be used with Photobooth. There is one qualm I have which is the button on the microscope. I have a feeling a PC user may be able to snap shots with it but it doesn't work with my Mac. I really don't see that as a major negative though and would say this microscope is a great little investment.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cobra Digital DPS-2100 Digital USB Microscope", "Author": "mark thompson", "ReviewID": "R1FJDQKFNVWCOO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works good when usb makes connection , have play w/ usb cable to make connection , tried on 2 different pcs", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000HZXWUI"}}
