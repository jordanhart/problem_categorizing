Discovered it's not good at taking pictures at night since it does not have different environment settings to choose from, so it's very basic. It has a lag time after taking a picture to re-enter the screen to take another photo. And a slight lag time when snapping a photo, so sometimes I get blurred pictures and have to re-try and stay steady for a longer time after pressing the button to take a photo. It's really lightweight which is an advantage! If you want a no-fuss, simple photo camera this is it!

It was dead and the SD card was empty.  I pulled out the SD card and the battery and let it dry out.  A few hours later, everything was as good as new!

The pictures it takes are truly stunning and high quality. For the price, it really is an excellent deal, but unfortunately it won't accept the SD card I had with the Vivitar (a cheap SD card that I bought at Walmart). I ordered a Kodak brand 4GB SD card shortly after discovering that. I'm sure there are cheaper alternatives I could have opted for, but I'm not going to take any chances. For now, the internal memory will accept a measly 6 pictures. Thankfully I'm not in too much of a hurry to make use of the camera.

This is a good camera for the price. Takes good standard pictures. The only thing I highly dislike is that the flash is in such a place that I always cover it with my finger, so I've had to change how I hold a camera completely. I've never had this issue with any other camera. Like I said this was an upgrade I had a kodak that looked almost exactly like this one only it didn't have the rounded corners and was a little thicker. Another thing is you have a wait time in between pictures. Even though it doesn't say you do, if you take a picture right after you already took one the flash doesn't go off and then you again have to take another picture.

It would come on for only a second and then shut off right away again.  I didn't want to invest any more money by buying a new powercord as they suggests as another option.

I was so excited. I was in need of a replacement for months now after having a water accident with the last one in Calistoga. I searched the website for days trying to figure the best deal to get the best bang for my buck and while Amazon has many great deals I finally just settled with this one.Kodak's are my favorite cameras I have never had any trouble out of them any of them. So I figured at best I'd be getting a known reliable camera product. Not the case with this one. I ordered it in silver. After unpacking it and placing it on the charger I had to go online to check the light status for charging. It was blinking red and then went to sitting still at red. In my experience with any charging device red means charging and it goes to green to let you know charging is complete. Not this one...blinking is charging and a still light means charged. No big deal other than it could mention that on the brief leaflet that comes with the camera in the way of getting started instructions, again no big deal.After the camera had charged some I unplugged it, turned it on just fine, took a couple shots just to see how the pics looked. So far so good I was pleased. Placed the camera back on the charger for it to continue powering up. End of the day coworker comes by to check out my nifty new camera....I hand it to her and she presses the power on button.....nothing......I take the camera back from her and press the button just the same.....nothing.....plug it up to the charger the light goes red....still.....its completely charged....turns on plugged up.....unplugged shuts off wouldnt come back on.....plugged it up again this time no charging light but the camera would still come on plugged up.....So I put in my request for a refund shipped back out the same day and I will be continuing my search. It is likely I will not get a Kodak this time around just due to my disappointment.The pictures I snapped looked great but I didnt want to take a chance on getting a replacement of the same camera and it being another dud. I missed the opportunity to have it for our first camping trip over the weekend but was totally excited to have it for my daughter's first day of 1st grade. Not anymore. So I will have to wait on the camera and dish out more dough to get another camera for that occasion. Pain in the butt.....From my experience Kodak is a great camera/printing company this is a first and I am not happy.
