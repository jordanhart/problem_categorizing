I purchased this camera as a birthday present for my husband in June of 2012 from Sears. First, the description listed the camera color as red and the camera I received was pink, not that big a deal because I got this camera on sale for a great price. I purchased this to replace a 6MP Kodak Easy Share which my husband loved, it was a great camera until he dropped it and cracked the camera lens. We have used this camera for about 7 months now and I am really disappointed. The pictures are blurry most of the time and the color of pictures taken indoors is really bad, either washed out or with a yellow tint. We have tried adjusting the settings and nothing seems to improve the picture quality and color. Pictures taken outdoors turn out ok as long as it is bright and sunny outside. If it's cloudy photos come out dark or shadowy. Also, this camera was part of a bundle which included a camera case, the case is a shiney patten leather with pink trim, really ugly. Please do not waste your money on this camera.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "takes it a second to focus each time", "Author": "MelSweet", "ReviewID": "R145K3E1IL6JKQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I paid only $60 so it was worth the price - but its not the best camera, good enough for my purposes thoughcase is cheeseyred color is nicecan get a good pic but might not be on the first try Haha", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Outstanding grain, sharpness and gradation\nProduces vivid, faithful color reproduction", "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix JZ100 Digital Camera Bundle Red", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UMZtleKZL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00006JPHT"}}
