Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"", "ReviewID": "R1H6E8NJGX3MUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually bought my Niko in Japan and it came with the NiMH batteries, which I'll get too later.  I had intended on buying one of the newer Sony camera's, but after shopping around a little I found that Nikon had all the same features as the Sony equivelant and took better pictures.  Sony pics look a little grainy, especially at large sizes.  This is my first digital camera although I've had a digital video camera for almst 4 years.  Picture quality: first and foremost, the picture quality is very good and is easily of the best camras in the 3.2 meg range.  I've worked to blow the pictures up, use them as screensavers, etc and they look immaculate on my 19\" screen.Scenes: I haven't had much call to use the scene function, but I have worked on the indoor/ outdoor settings, portrait and even took some pictures with the \"snow\" setting in a room that looked way too white.  The scenes also utilize flash contol. Overall these are easy to use, although as Amazon notes, you probably won't have use for many of them.Performance:  Autofocus could be a little quicker and a little more responsive in my book.  I've had problems with the camera not focusing during portraits and coming out all blurry.  With the time it takes to autofocus, the time it takes to record and the time it takes to setup for the next pic, the shutter speed is moot.  Usually though, the camera works very well, indoors and outdoors.  Outdoor pics look amazing on a nice sunny day.  The Flash is a pain and requires some tooling.  Get too close and everything comes out white, portrait takes a little too long.  Everything else is fine.Batteries: My biggest complaint.  Anyone out there expecting to get any kind of use out of regular batteries can dream on.  Even the NiMH batteries die way too fast and require constant recharging.  When the batteries get low, which is usually after 10 or so pics, the camera will auto shut down while the flash recharges.  Very irritating when combined with the autofocus and the time it takes to record pics to the memory.  Takes forever to get another shot off.  I'm tempted to bring the review down to three stars over this one feature, but I haven't experimented with other batteries yet so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt.  Conveience: The size, features and computer to camera setup is top notch.  I have windows XP and I didn't need to install any software to copy the pics to my hard drive.  It was plug and play.  I like that the camera uses compact flash cards while other companies are going to more expensive formats.  I have an Epson printer that can copy pics of the CF cards and they lok amazing.Value: about average for a camera in this class, and I think the pros outweight the cons.  Lets face it, this is just above entry level and not the best camera on the market, but easily one of the best in it's price range.  Having owned this one for a little over a month, I may decide not to skimp when I upgrade.  Most of my complaints could be easily resolved if I were willing to shell out the extra dough.  Great camera for vacations, parties and portability.", "Date": "April 30, 2003"}, {"Title": "Pretty Damn good", "Author": "P.S.", "ReviewID": "ROKK1MYFIK3H9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, here is the truth.  I bought this camara because I had a business trip to Japan.  Wanted something small.  Wanted something light.  This camara delivers this.  Before I bought it I read all the reviews...Now here is the truth.  The pictures are great but a couple of points.  1) this is a small camara.  That means you need a steadier hand than with a larger camara.  2) it has a dozen different picture settings, and they do make a difference especially in low light so you have to be fairly active with your settings  3) software is outdated, you must update from the Nikon website and it isn't the easiest process for the novice  4) No rechargable battery or case included 5) stupid 16 meg card included, you must upgrade 6)It does take up to six seconds to write the picture to the card, that is slow by digital standardsWhile this may sound like a lot of drawbacks here are the strengths 1) picture quality better than others 2)size, only the elph is smaller but this is much more comfortable3) nikon software is so simple both for picture modifications and red eye one touch 4) uploading to your computer or the nikon website is one touch and you get 50 megs online.  In my mind the pros outweigh the cons but you have to make the decision for yourself.  I for one am happy with my choice.", "Date": "May 17, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good product...good value", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R279D4KI0AA28O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to buy my first digital camera this summer, and I had narrowed it down to the canon s400 and the nikon 3100. Ultimately, I chose the Nikon because of the price difference, but I've been very satisfied with my choice.The most common complaint I've heard is the battery life. I've used the camera on 6 or 8 separate occasions, and have filled my 128 mb memory card, and the original battery is still going strong. Just don't leave the camera on when you're not actively taking pictures and you'll be fine (though I'd still recommend keeping some spare NiMH batteries with you).The scene modes can be useful--I took some great fireworks pictures over the 4th of July with that scene mode, and the backlight mode works well too. However, sometimes you need to take a picture quickly, and then they just get in the way.The other complaint I've heard is the flash (i.e. the multiple flashes that are annoying and make the camera take too long to take a picture). That problem is easily solved...just turn from red-eye reduction mode to standard flash mode. Then, if you get red-eye, just fix it on your computer.Which leads me to my one complaint about the camera. The imaging software that came with it was a pain to use, and didn't give great results when you try to edit the photos. I upgraded to Photoshop Elements, and haven't had any problems since.The size of the camera is perfect...small enough to carry around easily, but big enough to still hold steadily. The grip feels good, and the zoom/shutter buttons are well placed so you can use them with just one finger.The picture quality is great...everything I'd expect from a Nikon (esp. with the Nikkor lens). I've been using some of my pics as desktop backgrounds (at 1600x1200), and they still look great. I can't wait to get my first set of prints back!Overall this is a great little camera...no regrets, and I've got more cash in my pocket than if I'd bought the Canon", "Date": "July 8, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera, Great Little Price", "Author": "\"trescajones\"", "ReviewID": "R1GNZUZ6SZCU1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about a day now and I love it.  I read a lot of reviews and saw that the main flaw was battery life, and that the included cr-v3 battery would die after 10 minutes.  This has absolutely not been true so far.  With the original battery I have taken over 200 pictures at the highest quality setting, and the battery is still going strong.The camera will easily fit into a pocket, and thanks to the built in lens cap you don't have to worry about it getting scratched.  The menu is easy so easy to follow I was up taking pictures in less then 10 minutes from opening the box.  The biggest problem, I think, is the scene modes.  The seem to just make your life difficult.  But the autofocus/flash is so effective that these other features almost never have a chance to get in your way.  The manual exposure compensation is the easiest way to manage the light getting into the camera, and ensures that every photo looks great.  The only things you need that are not included in the box are a) rechargeable batteries, cause the included cr-v3 will not last forever, and b) a 128 mb min memory card.  The included card takes 10 pics at highest resolution, while a 128 takes 80 at the highest quality, and over 150 at the next highest quality.  This is a great camera and is so easy to use and it does not cost a lot of money.  The pictures look great and are more than enough resolution for prints up to 8x10.", "Date": "June 12, 2003"}, {"Title": "Fantastic pictures, easy to use, tiny size, well constructed", "Author": "Minuteman", "ReviewID": "R2UM6GF45YQPX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the Nikon Coolpix 3100 a week ago, and I can't say enough about it.  ...  The pictures it takes are phenomenal.  I thought about going for a 4-megapixel model, but decided against it due to the expense.  I can now see from the fantastic quality of the pictures I've been taking that 4 MPs would have been overkill for a first digital camera.The 3100 has an insane number of scene modes and settings to play with, although I haven't done so yet.  I've just been using it on the \"Auto\" setting and it's worked great.  Well worth the money.  The Nikonview software for viewing, editing, compressing and emailing your pictures is really easy to use.  I like the fact that the camera uses 2 AA-size batteries rather than a proprietary battery module.  Much more convenient and versatile.  Just make sure you get a set of at least 4 rechargeable NiMH AA-size batteries and a battery charger.  Regular alkaline batteries didn't last more than 10 minutes, but the rechargeable NiMHs last much longer (about an hour and a half).  You will also want to buy a larger Compactflash card than the 16-meg card that comes with the camera. ...", "Date": "April 18, 2003"}, {"Title": "Nicely done!", "Author": "David Berck \"cruecut\"", "ReviewID": "RYMO9KRJ981GI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You get a lot of bang for the buck with this one. Firstly, the camera is *tiny*, but still has that wonderful Nikkor lens. Being a fan of the swivel lens design, I do miss that, but the picture quality so far has been superlative.As with small cameras, the flash can be problematic in that it's just not all that powerful. However, you can compensate some by monkeying around with the settings manually or use one of the scene settings. I took a nice picture of a sunrise to experiment with the scenes, and I have a nice mixture of deep indigo with red on the horizon. It'll go absolutely anywhere you need it to go, and unlike the reported problem with the coolpix 3500, shutter speed is much improved.My only criticisms right now are the weak flash (but what do you want from something so small) and the load time between pictures. The second problem may be fixed with a better CF card, but this camera is nice for snapshots, though some people will complain about the startup time. I'm enjoying this camera immensely right now!", "Date": "April 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Perfect budget camera", "Author": "Stephan", "ReviewID": "R21LV61MBJRK9T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm an 18 year-old kid, and I wanted a camera I could take with me wherever I went to take pictures of my friends and such, but obviously, I'm shopping on a budget, so I didn't want to spend a lot... I was thinking along the idea of like a cell phone camera, only a) I find those to be rude and obnoxious, b) I wanted something that would take good quality photos, and c) I waned to be able to load them onto my computer. So my big issues were:1) Portability; had to be a small camera2) Image quality; had to take good pictures3) Cost; Wanted to get the most camera for my money (NOTE: This included other aspects of camera buying, such as batteries, memory, etc, not just the cost of the camera itself)I did a lot of shopping, both in stores and online, talked to a lot of people, and read a lot of reviews. In the end, it came down to this camera, and the Sony Cybershot DSC-P32. I was torn, an after carefully weighing the pros and cons of both cameras, I decided to go with this one; my moms old Nikon point-and-shoot never did her wrong, so I held my breath and bought this one.I must say, I was glad I did my homework. This camera is one of the best investments I've ever made. I've had it for about a month, and still don't have any -real- complaints. I understood how to use it right out of the box, and when I did have to use the documentation, it was very well written. It's small enough that I can carry it in my pocket whenever I go out with my friends, (note: I wear baggy-ish cargo pants) but still take very high quality pictures. The camera can be a little unstable with being used without the flash, but I've found that the BSS feature usually takes care of the cameras tendency to produce blurry pictures when used without a flash.The three big issues I have/had with this camera, and the ones everyone else seems to have are:1) Battery Life2) Memory3) Flash/Movie mode/other performance issues1) Battery Life: The battery life of the camera seemed to be a gripe everyone had. The Lithium battery that the camera came with lasted me through my 'play period,' when I was getting familiar with how the camera worked, as well as through my friends birthday party before it finally kicked the bucket. Obviously, this camera goes through regular alkaline dry cells like a fat kid through cake, but I bought some Panasonic Nickel Metal Hydride batteries w/ a charger for like 15 bucks, and those have been fine; I keep 2 in my camera, and 2 in my pocket in case they go dead. I would recommend taking as many pictures as you can WITHOUT the flash though, because the flash does put a lot of strain on the battetries... Memory: The camera comes with a 16MB card. This obviously isnt enough. One of the main reasons I bought ths camera was because it takes CompactFlash memory, not Sony's (more expensive) MemoryStick memory. Just splurge on the extra card; its well worth it, trust me. Or, be like me and wait for your birthday to roll around, and ask for it then :)Performance Issues: The flash can be very taxing on the battery, and you WILL get redeye if you dont use the redeye flash. But, the camera performs pretty well in most lights without flash, just make sure to use the BSS option, becaue your first pictures will come out blurry. It does, however, perform rather poorly in low light; restaurants have been of particular bother to me; because the flash is too bright and black out the background, but if I don't use it my pictures will come out yellow. In manual mode, it has a lot of things you can play with to rectify the situation though, just play with it to find out what works best for you. I find shutter conpensation to be the best remedy for this situation.As far as movie mode goes, it's not a camcorder, it's a camera. If you want to make movies, go buy a camcorder.All in all, this is a great camera to take with you for those 'had to be there' shots, which is why I bought it. It's customizable, portable, efficient, and takes great pictures. Good for someone who doesn't know a lot about photography, but know what looks good and what doesn't. The camera isn't perfect, but I wasn't looking for perfection. It's a very well-rounded camera thats good for what it costs, and I personally don't regret buying it.", "Date": "March 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "Fun little gem", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3EVERQ96F7NWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Small, easy to use, excellent quality to 5 x 7 prints, good quality at 8 x 10. I own a Nikon 5700 digital camera and love it, but it's complex overkill for others in my house. They LOVE this camera for its size, its picture quality, its scene modes, its flexibility and its \"go anywhere\" size. On jaunts it's always around someone's neck or just in their hands.Foolproof and REALLY simple to use; scene modes are wonderful. Flash is anemic, but we've found Nimh batteries are good for 50-60 pix easy, and a set or two of good ones plus a charger is all that's really needed. Add a 256 high-speed CF card and one is ready for anything. A GREAT camera for a novice.Incredibly easy to use; hooked it up to our TV right out of the box and used the TV to focus, crop, and then shoot portraits.

Just by messing around with it for 20 to 30 minutes I figured out how to operate most of the functions.2.) Great price. I was looking at sony p7 and canon. Both of these cameras were nice and had a few more options than the Nikon but I like the Nikon's style and functionability better.3.) LCD screen. I liked Nikon's screen better than Sony's just because it was recessed. With Sony's if you set it down on a flat surface then the screen would have come into contact with the surfaceCons:1.) My friends have reported little white spots of light on their pictures. I have noticed a few little spots on pictures that I've taken but they aren't bad. I have also noticed that these spots will occur on other cameras, even disposable.2.) Battery life is about average. My batteries usually last 45 minutes to an hour. I have rechargable nickle batteries.3.) The 16mb memory disc is standard but I got a 128mb one as well so that I would be able to hold plenty of pictures.This is my first digital camera.. It takes great pictures but like everything it is not perfect\ufffdIt is easy to figure out how to use and the controls are well placed for its small size. But it really is small and sometimes it is awkward to handle but the small size is great for travel and is small enough to fit in a loose pocket comfortably. I would have liked a bigger memory card. I bought a 128mb card when I bought the camera. I took about 150 pics on vacation and had room for about 150 more. 64mb would be plenty. You really should buy rechargeable batteries. This camera goes through batteries rather quickly. I bought regular alkaline batteries \ufffd they lasted about 5 minutes I then bought Lithium batteries :). The rechargeable batteries die after taking about 50-60 pictures. The movie quality was pretty good and you can edit the movies on the camera. Shutter response time is slow. In low light without the flash pictures become very blurry. I would guess the shutter automatically stays open longer to compensate for low light. I have not found a way to prevent this. On high quality the write time to the card seems long, about 7-8 seconds. I would like more features that you would find on a higher priced bigger camera but I wanted this to travel with and it worked great for that. It gave me good prints and it was pretty easy to use.

Also, you get a really good grip when you hold it in your hand, which is also important.The image quality is great; for examples, see peterlindberg.se/photologIf you buy this camera, you should be aware that the batteries take a few, say 4 or 5 charges to function properly.

It's my first digital camera, and so far, I'm impressed.  I've used plenty of Nikon 35mm and SLR cameras, but I needed a portable, high quality, yet affordable, digital camera.  This is it.  It is the smallest 3+ megapixel digital camera I've seen, even smaller than its big brother the Coolpix 4300.  I would have bought the 4300 but then this camera came out and is pretty close in quality and quite a bit cheaper than the 4300.  As for quality, this camera impresses me greatly...especially because of its small, yet very comfortable size.  Sure, there are smaller cameras, but they fall out of your hands, whereas this one does not (I always use the wrist strap anyway).  The scene modes are a bit of overkill, but the full auto mode works well, and I have yet to really get into the \"manual\" mode, but it seems to be quite useful for taking several pictures at the same time/selecting the best shot (using the camera's automatic best shot selector feature).

First it had to be compact and easy to hold.  It had to have over 3x zoom and at least 3 mega pixels.  We wanted it to be worth the money as well.  Remember to buy at least a 256 memory card so that you can take a couple hundred good resolution pictures that you can print out in great quality.  Placement of your hand is comfortable and not straining.  It's so small it can fit in your pocket!  We got great shots and our printed pictures came out almost like our SLR quality.We separately bought the recharger since this camera takes 2AA batteries.

For me image quality was the most important consideration. Of course price was a consideration too; when I started reviewing all the models I didn't think I'd be buying a Nikon...!I found this camera to be terrific value with amazing specs and functionality. And a big bonus was that this camera will easily fit in your pocket. I'm content to take it around with me all the time.This model provides professional results for a modest outlay. It's very simple and intuitive to use and the options and image manipulation modes are fluid and responsive in operation. It doesn't hang and freeze like some cameras I've used in the past.And for those with a background in serious SLR photography this camera will offer a pleasing array of exposure options. Once you've figured out what all the dials and buttons mean you have a high degree of control. And of course you've got immediate feedback so it's no problem just trying again...Two other bits worth mentioning: it has a viewfinder (these things really come in handy) and the lens opens up to 2.8 - great for low light situations. I haven't tried the movie mode yet. The main issue with this being that there's no audio.(I should also mention, and this has only peripheral relevance to this review, that 3.2 megapixels is more than enough. I find that I never utilize the full resolution. I bought this 3.2MP model over the identically specified Nikon Coolpix 2100 (2MP) because the price was only $40 higher)I got this camera off the \"grey market\" so I didn't get the usual equipment in the package There were no cables or software, and generic batteries, charger and card reader. In fact the only original equipment was the camera itself. But this is comforting - it means there are absolutely no proprietery parts and you're not at the mercy of peculiar software or connections. I'd snapped a few pictures and was viewing them on my PC within minutes; nothing to install or configure. And you've got three options as far as batteries are concerned, with standard AAs to fall back on, which is also very comforting. Basically what I'm saying is that as long as you've got the camera in your hand you can always take and process pictures. You're not going to be dependent on any special accessories. It is suggested that this camera has a weak flash. So far I've had no problems. Using the special night time mode the pictures are actually wonderfully exposed. I've used SLR cameras for years and I'm amazed at some of the nighttime and indoor exposures - I wouldn't have thought such results were possible outside a studio. And the design puts the flash relatively far from the lens which reduces red eye problems. I was also worried by reports of problems with flashcard compaitibility. I can report that there have been no problems with the cheap 128MB card I purchased. I can also report that I've experienced no problems with battery life. The camera was in my hand for two whole days and I was snapping pictures of everything that caught my eye and flicking through my creations on the LCD montitor and showing them to friends the whole time before the battery ran out. And NiMH are supposed to get better after the first few charges.Finally I'll note that the camera is well built and well designed. It feels sturdy enough and every control seems to be intuitive and positioned in just the right place for my (big and clumsy) fingers.I recommend this camera for its features and image quality, with low price and small size being the clinchers. This camera (or the lower resolution Coolpix 2100) should fit most requirements and budgets.

I definately wanted a camera that was compact, feature rich, simple to use, asthetically pleasing, as well as affordable. I was originally sold on the Cannon A70, is identically priced, but problems with error messages, reports of poor customer service, and the need for 4 AAA rechargebles instead of the Coolpix's 2, scared me away from Cannon. Don't get me wrong, Cannon's are great,as well as Pentax Optios, and Casios. I was impressed by some of the pictures takken with these models, especially the Elph Series. Cannon may have poor customer service, but there is always a Cannon sales Rep. at the Best Buy, peddling his wares and showing u samples,but I put a lot of stock in Amozon customer reviews! This camera takes great photos at it's mid and highest Res. The only cons I can see are the fallowing: 1)The carrying case for this baby is very expensive because it must be purchased with a AAA battery charger and two rechargeble batteries..... you say you don't want one but when u see how nice this camera looks you'll change your mind. Most guys already have a battery charger and Nic Cd or NMH batteries, so this was not economical, although the pouch is nice looking. 2)Unlike the Canon A70, there is no sound in movie mode which gives a kind of Groucho Marks effect, but the 3100's superb picture Quality more than makes up for this!! 3)I would strongly recommend u purchase at least a 128mb cf mem. card with 12x or higher processing speed to cut lag time,which seems to be a gripe with other users. The 12x may seem small,but spend the extra money on a faster speed, when u get the camera with it's slow, low Mem.(16Mb)CFlash card and then upgrade; the differance is night and day! Believe me the 12x helps. If I were you I would trust Sandisk or Leexar. I chose the latter, a 256mb 12x Lexar CF card, purchased from amozon for under $50.  Got to my doorstepp 5 days early, with free shipment. No matter what brand camera u purchase u will have to upgrade the memory, it's an inevitabillity!! At the camera's highest Reso. you simply wont have enough memmory. Shop around for sure, but before you buy, you owe it to yourself to see the clear, vibrant pictures this next-generation Nikon Coolpix is able to deliver! They also have web sights that compare photos of cameras in same price range and pixles, just type in the name of the camera on your browser.

So, this isn't my first digital camera, and I'm fairly experienced in photography. I use the camera mostly for documenting product failures, and maybe quick snaps when I don't feel like hauling around my Nikon N90 and assorted lenses. Picked this camera because of size and what looked like good results at the stores.  Great little camera to keep handy for those moments when you \"wish I had a camera handy\"First to say, I was impressed by the photo results.  At least as good if not better exposed than my 4300.  Flash as others have said is pretty weak, and no attachment for external flash.  Camera is small, so fits easily in shirt or jacket pocket, however the small size makes it very difficult to not get camera shake.  My wife finds it impossible to take clear pictures with it, all her photos show camera shake.  A lot of my pics are taken under flourescent light, so the custom set white balance where you aim at a grey card and the camera adjusts the white balance is great.  Phots that would otherwise come out very blue come out almost perfect balance. Macro scene mode works well, it is a pain to have to turn off the flash every time I switch the camera on in macro though. I purchased the camera at Fortess in Hong Kong, came with case, 64mg card, charger and 2 nimh batteries.  Now we get to the battery life bit.  Not good.  The \"Nikon\" batteries supplied don't seem to work well.  Bought a set of Sony 2100mah batteries that will keep the camera powered for a day or two, an additional 2 sets of 2300mah batteries I'm in the process of conditioning.  Ive got the firmware upgrade and the low battery signal comes on after 2 shots, but then I can still take quite a few photos afterward. Without shooting, camera will stay powered up for the advertised 90 minutes.  Apparently this may be a manufacturing issue over a design issue. Some cameras have great battery life, some have terrible battery life. I've heard it may have to do with the machining of the negative terminal on the battery case, poor machining and polishing on some have left a rough surface on the terminal, causing poor contact with the battery. If you're having problems, check the cover, if the contact is rough, try polishing it with very fine grit polishing cloth (like the auto body shops use) and see if it helps. Shutter lag isn't any worse than any other compact digital I've tried, slightly better even than the 4300.  Write to card times seem a little slow, even using a 48X Lexar high speed CF card. Battery problems aside, remembering that this camera is aimed at the consumer market, those who just want a good compact camera for vacation \"snaps\" parties etc, this is a good choice.", "Date": "November 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "More experience - Update on previous review", "Author": "Robert Szabolcsky", "ReviewID": "R1IRX598SCH1FT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Writing an update to my review of last November. My main concerns then were battery life, shutter lag.  I've now switched from rechargable 2300mah AA batteries to the CRV3 Lithium batteries and find a BIG improvement in battery life.  First the rechargeable batteries don't have much of an in-camera shelf life, they'll static discharge in a week.  Second for some reason the CRV3 batteries will take many more exposures.  Am now looking for rechargeble CRV3 batteries. Second, shutter lag shouldn't be much of a problem if you use the \"sport\" mode on the dial on top.  Used this camera at the Macau Gran Prix, and had no problem capturing the action of F3 cars.  Will take several exposures in rapid succession, about 1.5 frames a second on 1024x780 resolution.

The camera comes with one Panasonic CV battery (not a rechargeable).  The battery was dead leaving me no choice but to load the camera with lithium AA's.  To reduce the size of the camera it only held two AA's or one CV-3,  the battery life of the AA was approx. 1 min. or 3 pics.After a little frustration and approx. 6 sets of batteries I went out and purchased a CV-3 replacement.  The new battery worked fine but the camera did not,  the auto focus on the camera took a very, very, very long time to lock in on the image (3-4 second).  During this time the subject would have moved or ran away.  After doing some investigating I came to realize the Nikon was known for the delayed shutter,  I found this very hard to work with.  After a night out with the family and several attempts of capturing a good, quality photo I gave up.The following day I took the camera back and purchased a Canon A70, a step up from my A20.  I love the canon, it is very quick to snap the picture and had a great battery life (with my lithium rechargeable AA's).

First, the camera is small. It doesn't fit my pocket, yes, but when it comes to similarly sized cameras, this one wins in the price category. The LCD is wonderfully lit, an comparing to most of my friend's, Coolpix 3100's is clearer even when viewed at odd angles (and with bright light). I also have that small dot that many users complain about, but I don't really mind it, as it's not immediately noticeable anyway. Picture-wise, this camera produces very satisfying results. The 14 scene / assist modes are a wonderful addition to help you get the most impressive pictures for almost any situation. I, however, have found myself turning the flash off more often, as the results are softer and more pleasing, in both cases, it performed well. Speaking of the flash, I always wonder why it has to turn off and recharge every so often, which makes taking another picture seem like forever,but once you get used to it, then it's all fine. It's power usage is probably its worst aspect, don't even bother using Alkaline batteries coz it would die even before you take a single picture. Even with rechargeable NI-MH's, it still goes through it pretty fast. Ready a spare every time because you don't know when it would go off.

I am an extreme beginner in photography, so I don't know all the terminology and such, but the only complaint I have is that it's a little difficult to get action shots because the camera has a delay when you hold down the button.

Disposable Lithium AA batteries work a little better. The accessory rechargeable batteries that Nikon recommends work pretty well. You can take about 15-20 pictures with continuous use.

My first picture was taken at night at 3M (Below Highest Quality). The picture was not very good. It was a little blurry and very low detail. I then used 3M* (The highest quality). And the picture came up crystal clear. Unbelievable detail and balance. I just could not believe that a picture with such quality and detail could be taken with a below 300 dollar camera. I have seen pictures from my friend's Canon A60 and was amazed by the quality of picture it took. But this Nikon is uncomparable.  Anyway, I tried with the 2M (3rd Highest) in the daylight, the detail and the quality is super. I guess, in the night a lot of detail is automatically lost because of low light. So, I have to use the Highest Quality to retain the detail that is coming in.

I also wish it had more zoom, which I should have thought of earlier, because I use this little fella to take pictures of airplanes which you usually can't get really close to.  3x is enough zoom for the average joe taking pictures of his friends, but if you are going to be taking pics of nature etc where more zoom is needed, there are a few cameras out there with 12x zoom that you should look into.

I am a real photo and video enthusiast and I have owned cameras since my father gave me my first Kodak Brownie (I wish I still had it) when I was a kid. Although I own quite a collection of SLR cameras and camcorders, this is by far the camera I use the most because of it's versatility and superb picture quality. It's size is definitely a plus and it is really cute. Anywhere I have ever showed it off people compliment it's good looks and small size, even if there are other cameras around, such as sonys, minoltas or canons.I agree with most of the pros that other users state in their reviews, but I have to be honest and say that there are a few of the flaws that most of the reviewers mention that I agree with also, such as poor picture quality in low light or indoors. A lot of the pictures taken when the flash goes off are definitely over-lighted. But I have gotten used to that and I still recommend the little camera overall. More expensive cameras with advanced features do not have this problems.There is however one more con which I want to mention which is a major one for me and I am very surprised that I have never seen anybody say it before in any of the hundreds of reviews I've read: the LCD display on this camera scratches easily, no matter how much you take care of it. And I know what I am talking about! I take care of my cameras how you would'nt believe. Both my son and daughter own different digital cameras, a Fuji and a Canon, and their LCD screens are'nt a bit scratched no matter how much they throw them around. I carry my Nikon in a case and I have been really careful about the LCD screen since I noticed the first little scratch appear, but it is more scratched every day. This, I know, is a cosmetic detail, but it does affect the looks of the camera, and everyone notices it.I would like to know if anybody else has noticed this.

It was definitely easier to use.As much as I like this camera I can't give it a 5 in that category.As a used camera it didn't come with a manual that may have helped.This camera is versatile. There are more photo settings than I will probably ever use!It's strong points are portability and picture quality.Portability: This camera is small enough to fit into your shirt or pants pocket. Although I wouldn't recommend that.It is light and small. My wife carries it in her purse regularly.Picture Quality: I see a noticeable difference in photo quality over cameras I have owned previously. Comparing pictures in a photo album you can see an improvement with the Cool Pics.Battery Life: I have come to the conclusion that battery life is a problem with virtually every digital camera. You have three options on the battery issue;1)Buy longer life batteries. My experience is that the extra life is not long enough to justify the added cost.2)Use re-chargeable batteries. This camera came with rechargeable batteries and a charger.They don't work and another set we used for different gadgets didn't work well either.3)Buy batteries in bulk and conserve them as much as possible. We went this route.For example,don't leave the camera on for extended periods unless you're shooting photos. We buy 8 or 12 packs of Duracells or Rayovacs on sale and they last long enough for what we need.The viewer window is big enough to be effective when pointing the camera for a shot. It's accurate, no top or bottom of the photo missing the target like some cameras do.Another cool feature is the power button.It slides and is spring loaded. Push it to the right to turn on or off. It's convenient and I prefer it over a push-button.This should prevent accidentally bumping the button and draining the batteries.I almost forgot to mention another strong point; the port for downloading photos to a computer and the memory card slot are conveniently located(on the sides) and easy to access. We bought an additional memory card because of the cheap price. Downloading photos either way is really easy with the Cool Pics whether you use a $3 memory card reader or directly from the camera using a USB port cable.The Cool Pics 3100 has served us well and I wouldn't hesitate to buy this camera again.I plan on looking for another one when this current camera needs to be replaced in the future.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lasted for a year...", "Author": "K.
