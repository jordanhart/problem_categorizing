{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HOPEFULLY THIS WILL SAVE YOU SOME HEADACHES", "Author": "Mom", "ReviewID": "R16RX2GRYQCHG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I will start with the fact that I have purchased 4 different monitors :1) 2.4GHz DIGITAL WIRELESS BABY VIDEO MONITOR SYSTEM WITH NIGHT VISION -- 2.4\" Color LCD Screen (Two-way Radio communication) by Smart AV ,2) MOBICAM DXR DIGITAL MONITORING SYSTEM,3) SAMSUNG WIRELESS VIDEO SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM w/ 3.5\" LCD,4) SUMMER INFANT BABY TOUCH COLOR VIDEO MONITOR by Summer infant. I have a 3yr. old and I was still using my Sony baby call monitor which I still love, but now I need to see when she gets out of her bed and I wanted the two way feature \"talk to the baby feature\" so I could talk to her and tell her to get back in her bed. I should also say that I want to see as much of her room around her bed as I could her room is 11 ft. by 12ft I put the camera in the corner on a shelf eight feet off the ground about 10 and \u00bd ft away from her bed, so if she got out of her bed I could see where she was. I could also see her during the day playing in her room. Well, let me say that they at least at this moment they don't make a monitor with a 100% \"clear\" picture for day and night vision. First up, I bought the 2.4 GHz MONITOR by SMART AV: It was good I could see her ok during the day, and at night with the night vision and I could hear her and she could hear me when I talked on it.CONS: Not the best picture but it was good enough. The camera did not adjust down far enough I had to put a coaster under the back half to get it to angle down some more and no sound bar (the lights that light up according to how noisy it is in the room). The big problem was it did not have the rechargeable batteries the other reviewers said it had. (Amazon told me it was probably because they bought it from a different seller not DBroth.) You can put regular batteries in it but if you want to plug it in you have to remove the batteries first. I tried to purchase the rechargeable batteries from them it has been a week and a half they still have not answered my emails. I returned it. Update: I never received a response. Next up, the MOBICAM DXR DIGITAL MONITORING SYSTEM: it had a ok picture during the day a little grainy but you could see. Night vision was grainy but ok.CONS: No sound bar, grainy day and night vision, when you touch the talk button to speak to the child it did not always work I would have to let it go and press it again to get it to work. I had it replaced with a new one thinking it might have been that one and the new one did the same thing. I called Amazon and they said they are not selling these directly anymore because of that happening to the batch of these they had maybe a bad batch they are investigating it, but you can still buy it from third party sellers on Amazon. UPDATE: Amazon is now selling them again. Next up, was the SAMSUNG WIRELESS VIDEO SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM w/ 3.5\" LCD: this one had the best picture of them all but only for during the day (although it had a yellow glow at the top of the screen from the light in the room but the light was not in the cameras view I adjusted the camera down even further and it still remained. It has a nice night light and music that you can turn on and off from the monitor. I really, really wanted to like it.CONS: The camera did not adjust down far enough for me on my shelf, so I put a coaster under the back half to angle it down some more, There were also some \"delays\" (like when walking or just moving fast the screen would \"miss some frames/some of the movement\" in the picture.) The temperature gauge was not correct, the alarm for detection of sound in the room was a pain to adjust, I did not like that when It went in to sleep mode (the screen goes black to power save) the volume would shut off, till it heard a sound, I wanted it on unless I turned it down, (which is how the baby touch monitor operates in sleep mode the sound does not shut off but you can turn it down if you wish), the zoom function was a BIG pain you have to go into the menu out of the \"picture screen\" and put it on zoom then go back to the \"picture screen\", the volume was not very loud at all my husband was like it doesn`t turn up louder than that?  The \"talk to the baby\" function was \"choppy\"(not as clear as the summer infant baby touch) and my absolute deal breaker was, I would think the MAIN REASON you would purchase a monitor like this the night vision: at night with and without a night light on in the room I could barely see anything much less my daughter in her bed you would really have to stare and look good to make any thing out, the infrared led's must not be strong at all. (If you want it for close up it might work I don't know never tested close up tested all of them in the same place about 10 and 1/2 feet away from her bed up on a shelf I need to see at least part of the room around her bed.) I was so aggravated by this search, I printed out a twenty percent off coupon from the internet for Babies R Us and went and bought the SUMMER INFANT BABY TOUCH MONITOR,  the new one they have with the touch screen monitor and pan and zoom camera. I put it to the test compared it to the SAMSUNG and MOBI. My two most important things were the night vision to see her at night and the \"talk to the baby\" function so I could talk to her. This summer infant model has a secure private connection unlike the other summer infant monitors. Its picture is ok (not HD but none of them are) slightly, slightly, slightly grainy during the day but still really good, and its night vision although a little grainy was the best out of all of them for the distance, (again I did not test close up) plus I can move the camera around remotely from the monitor to see where she's at in the room and I can zoom in easily the functions appear below and to the right of the picture when you touch the screen although the closer you zoom in the grainier it got but that was with ALL of the models I tested. AFTER A LOT OF TESTING AND DEBATE, I RETURNED THEM ALL EXCEPT FOR THE SUMMER INFANT BABY TOUCH MONITOR. I really like it. I am glad I just went ahead and spent a little more money and bought it. The pan and zoom features work great. (THIS IS THE ONLY MONITOR OUT OF THE ONES I TESTED THAT HAS THE ACTUAL PAN FEATURE. THE ABILITY TO MOVE THE CAMERA AROUND THE ROOM REMOTELY FROM THE CONTROLS ON THE MONITOR. The Samsung does not have the pan feature.) I can see her WHOLE room day or night. After a certain amount of time it goes into power save mode when it is not on the charger and turns off the picture but you can still hear the sound you can still adjust the volume and if you want to see the picture again just press the button on the top. If it is on the charger the picture will stay on unless you press the button on the top to turn the screen back off. The monitor has a lithium-ion battery and the camera has the option to put regular batteries in it if you can not plug it in a outlet. The monitor also has a belt clip that doubles as the stand for it when the monitor is not on the charger. I called summer infant to ask about recommendations for the rechargeable battery for the monitor the company says not to charge the battery more than eight hours and let it run down before you put it back on the charger for maximum battery life.UPDATE: IT HAS BEEN TWO YEARS WITH MY SUMMER INFANT.I have since purchased a second extra camera so I can watch her in the play room too I love it.I STILL USE IT EVERYNIGHT. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT AT ALL. I THINK I SHOULD JUST MENTION. I ALSO HAVE NOT DROPPED OR POSSIBLY DAMAGED MINE IN ANYWAY.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Video Monitor!!!", "Author": "Nerissa H. Watkins", "ReviewID": "R2NWJ8CWI2VA2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned many, many baby monitors.  The MobiCam DXR is definitely the best I've seen.  Previously my favorite was another Mobi...the MobiCam Digital (I think that was Mobi's first digital video monitor).  The DXR has all the great features of the MobiCam Digital, plus some other great features and overall improvements in button placement, battery life, range, etc.The basics:Picture quality on the DXR is very good and way better than other monitors. It's not crystal clear, but no monitor is.The DXR's rechargeable battery seems to last forever.  I used to keep my old monitor on audio only mode to avoid charging it more than once a day.  With the DXR I can keep the video on too and still only charge it once a day.The DXR monitor has easy to operate buttons and a user friendly menu.  You use the menu to set the time, pair cameras with the monitor, decide which cameras you want to view when cycling through cameras, change the brightness, and more.The range on the DXR system is fantastic!!!.  If you need a little extra range, slide up the antenna.  It does make a difference.The DXR monitor has a stand on the back that allows me to prop it up at several angles for viewing when standing or sitting.  Most monitors don't allow the monitor to recline enough for viewing when standing (such as while cooking).The unique features:Quad Mode: This DXR system works with up to 4 cameras and can automatically cycle through each camera every 5 or 15 seconds.  Even cooler is Quad Mode, where you can see all 4 cameras at once.  Since the screen is rather large (3.5 inches), even split in 4 you get a nice size image from each camera.Two-Way Audio: The DXR allows you to not only hear your children, but talk to them too.  There is a button on the monitor that you hold down to talk to your kids, then let it go to listen again (like a walkie-talkie).  It's awesome if you have little kids that like to jump out of bed and play when they are supposed to be napping!!!  The voice comes through extremely clear and the volume is perfect.FYI...I have not yet used the power saving, voice activation, or recording/playback features; nor have I connected the monitor to a PC.This monitor is a real winner.  One other plus is that Mobi customer service is absolutely awesome.  I contacted them with a question regarding my old monitor and they were helpful far beyond my expectations.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "DO NOT PURCHASE!", "Author": "Twin Mom", "ReviewID": "R3VKT4KMLFI53D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am writing to let you know of my experience with Mobi.  I have never written a review before.  And I am a very brand loyal consumer.  Price has never been an issue. I have always sought the best possible products for my children.  This is why I placed an order for a Mobi monitor months before my twins were born.  I heard of the new DXR that was to be on the market soon.  I decided to wait for the upgrade.I receive the monitor and one camera shortly before my twins were born.  I spent a great amount of time on the phone with Mobi's service team to set up the camera.  Here is where the problems started:1. The registration code for the internet program did not come with the camera.2. The instructions were very poor; and although I am very tech savy, there was no means of following the setup without a technician.3. It was a great disappointment to learn that my computers integrated camera (hence skype,etc.) needed to be disabled in order for the remote access to be used.4. It was a further disappointment to learn that the monitor needed to be attached to the computer to remotely view.  This makes leaving the monitor with a sitter and simultaneously viewing my children from a remote location impossible.5. Luckily I have both a Mac and a Dell in the house.  The program could not run on the Mac computers in the house (since it only works with Windows - which was also not disclosed).Then the wait continued.I waited three more months for the second camera.My twins were born and we started them in the same crib because we only had one monitor. At ten weeks of age (last Friday) the second camera was delivered.  I promptly set it up and again the non-disclosed issues and problems continued.6. I purchased this monitor because of the ability to see multiple camera views (two cribs) at the same time.  Yet, with the split screen the sound does not work.  As a mother listening for her children in the middle of the night - sound is the most important factor!  So I resorted to the scan option that earlier versions and other competitors also have.7. When I turned the monitor off because I had night help with the babies, and then turned it on again in the morning - I would have to go back in to the settings each time and choose scan.  It would not remember my choice to scan between both cameras.And the FINAL item has lead me to promptly return these items to the retailer where I purchased it....8.  Last night I went to sleep trusting my MOBI monitor.  The babies are across the house and we are not able to hear them without a monitor.  They were to be fed at 1:30 am.  At 3:00 am I woke, looked over at the monitor and saw the babies kicking - BUT NO SOUND!  I walked in to their room and they were frantically crying!!  I am not sure how long they were left unattended.  Tears were running down their little faces and it was heartbreaking.  I double checked all settings on the monitor.  The sound had failed!!!  How is a mother to trust that her children as being monitored with this type of security device?I sincerely hope that MOBI resolves some of these issues before other parents go through the time and disappointment that I have experienced.  Today I purchased a Summer's Infant Baby Touch monitor.  I love the scan and zoom feature.  The touch screen is much easier to use.  And now I am waiting once again on the second camera.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY!!", "Author": "mommyofthree", "ReviewID": "RQ1M5HHUCCWG4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please do yourself a favor and buy a different monitor!! If you are planning on using more than one camera with this monitor then it is useless! I had 2 additional cameras attached...the video portion of this monitor works great. In quad mode there is NO sound at all...not even for one camera. Also while running the scanning feature the sound WILL stop working at some point during the night...might be after 5 minutes might be after several hours but it WILL STOP WORKING!! I called the manufacturer about this and this is a problem that is going to occur...they are working on a fix but do not have it yet!! How you put a product out there that you KNOW is not going to work is beyond me. Also when this monitor is put into scanning mode there is a popping noise that occurs when it switches between rooms and a bright blue light that comes on in your childs room when they are being seen. Probably not a big deal for newborns as they will probably sleep right thru it...but for my kids ages 3 and 1 the light was like a strobe light in their dark room keeping them from falling asleep. The popping also bothered my 3 year old as he thought there were monsters in the camera! I tried on a few occasions to use the intercom feature and all that resulted was a terrible feedback noise into my childrens rooms...talk about monsters! The last feature that didn't work as noted is the power button. I could never get the machine to turn off using the power button...i always had to use the reset button on the back.

Mobi says a battery for the camera does not exist yet but they are working to create one.  This is fine, as you just need to keep it plugged in, but I thought mine was missing a part when I opened the back of the camera.The camera lights are a bit distracting for my little one. If she stirs and notices the lights, she jerks her head to get a better look, further waking her and prohibiting her from falling back to sleep.  I will be moving the camera higher and a bit more out of her line of sight.VIDEO RECORDI purchased a 4GB SR card (don't forget to order one when you buy the monitor!).  The video recording works great, and records in 30 second segments with a time stamp. Each 30 seconds takes up 3MB of memory.  With a 4GB card, I can get just over 11 hours.  (60 min = 360MB, 1024 MB = 1 GB, 4GB = 11.3 hours).

This one is not a bad product in general, but I see more cons rather than pros. I've used it with one camera only, so I cannot know yet if I'd like it more or even less with additional cameras. But here are my notes of using it so far.Pros:-big, huge screen. Even in split screen it's OK to see the picture.-very easy and convenient navigation in general with all buttons up front.-it shows time and date.-you can record video or make pictures.-night vision has a very decent picture even from farther away.-very well made using a good material. Leaves a 'real' thing feeling.Cons:-monitor is to bulky in general. It does not fit in palm or in any pocket!-I cannot see on the screen or anywhere else how much of a battery life there is left, and it does not make any sound before turning off. I end up with a 'dead' monitor in the middle of the nap time almost every day!-the picture is way to much enhanced and narrowed. With old version camera standing in the same spot I'd have half of the room covered, now the crib is barely fitting in the picture.-camera is also kind of big and weights a lot. If left standing, it does not get a picture from crib down below. To have it hanging they included one more heavy metallic attachment to screw it to the wall. It should have a perfect flexibility although looking at the construction and metallic head swiveling in that holder makes me feel like it will not take much time for it to loosen and start to keep on falling down. And that head is going only up and down, you would not be able to move it to any of the side.- 'turn off' button is annoying! You have to push it and hold for at least 3 to 5 sec so it would shut it off. So not good in the middle of the night when in rush to calm screaming baby and not willing to make your spouse get mad by listening to that perfect song in double the sound!- any of the buttons are not responding from the first push. Volume, 'talk to baby', menu (every single of them!) would respond only from the second time. Not good in the middle of the night again.- the audio sound is not that clear either. With minimum being a 0 a maximum here is a 6. In a day time I always have it at 5, when it's crowded or outside at 6, but not always I can tell right away that baby is up until she starts screaming so I can hear her without any additional help.-before I start talking to the baby through monitor the camera every time makes a 'click' sound, that I find kind of annoying as well.-it is expensive.So, I will keep on looking for something else and this will definitely go back. Good they have this perfect return policy!And, by the way - this was my third trial monitor I've tried to use after Lorex LW2003 LIVE snap Video and Summer infant's Sleek and Secure.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Day/Night Video Monitor!", "Author": "Heidi C.", "ReviewID": "R74CYN04BZ2B7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this monitor to watch over my 1 year old since she is now learning to stand up in her crib and I want to make sure that she doesn't try to climb out or hurt herself if she falls over while standing.  I picked this unit because of the variety of options (expandable up to 4 cameras, which was a must for use with baby #2) and for the price point.  I've only had this unit for about 36 hours, but I already love it!  The picture is incredibly clear in both day and night mode.  I'm able to see, even at night, if my daughter's eyes are open or if she's still sleeping.The 2 reasons that I gave this a 4 star review instead of a 5 star are 1) the camera makes a clicking noise when the monitor is first turned on, so when I turned it on in the morning to peek in my little girl it caused her to stir for a few minutes (I'm sure that she'll get used to this, but for those with light sleepers the click could cause a problem) and 2) the low battery indicator on the monitor never turned on, the unit just shut off when the battery died.  I'll be contacting Amazon to find out about the battery indicator and will update about that issue.  I'm also going to see if putting the monitor in Audio only mode when I'm not using it will prevent the click when I activate the camera.I have not yet tried connecting it to the internet or recording to an SD card, so I can't speak to those features.  My husband and I tested the 2-way voice and it worked pretty well.  We also haven't had any interference with any of our other electronics and we have several machines on wireless routers, as well as several different brands of cordless phones.  The setup was extremely simple, but depending on your nursery setup mounting the camera may require some imagination (if you're unwilling to use the wall mount) as the camera stand doesn't allow the camera to be aimed downward very far.  Aside from a few extremely minor issues, this is an exceptional monitor and I highly recommend it!UPDATE: I did find that switching to Audio Only allowed me to turn the screen on and off without having the clicking noise.  This also means that the battery life is shortened, but I just try to keep the unit plugged in when not in use and haven't had any issues with the battery dying on me during the 3-4 hours that I have it off the charger at night.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Didn't work more than 5 feet away", "Author": "FirestoneReview", "ReviewID": "R32PM232KK1M3N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recieved the unit as a gift from my family, and was very excited for the video monitor.

With my replacement, I paid for a battery for the camera so I wouldn't have to keep it plugged in 24/7. Guess how long the battery lasted? 2 hours. Really? How in the world can I watch my sleeping angel all night if the camera dies after 2 hours???? Also, I was told that I needed to download some software update deal that was not specified in manual (I was also told that this was the reason that the first one died). I had to go on their website, find it, download it, etc. All is good for the next....month. When the replacement dies again. Same exact problem as the first. So I call for ANOTHER replacement, told they would ship it the same day. 2 weeks later, nothing. So I call again and was told they were sending out a replacement, another 2-3 weeks pass and nothing.

We bought these cameras for the primary idea of being able to watch the twins at night and/or during nap time. We use the cameras a TON at night and the night vision has been great.

It has worked near perfect with the only issue being the occasional freeze up of the monitor (monitor won't turn off upon pushing of the power button).

I would have ordered a second Summer monitor (for the soon to be born second child) but the \"A\" frequency never worked in our house.  Wanted to have one child on the \"A\" frequency and the other on the \"B\" so each handheld monitor could switch to either room but that was not an option for us,so I purchased the Mobicam DXR with 2 additional cameras.  One camera and the monitor came first.  Everything worked fine out of the box.  There is quite a delay in the audio but one camera works just fine.  The baby decided to come to us 4 weeks early and I did not have the second camera set up.  Two nights before the new baby came home I took down the Summer and put up the second Mobicam camera.  As soon as I synced them the audio quit working and I cound not power down the display monitor.  The next day I called the number in the Mobicam manual.  The customer service lady I spoke to was very helpful.  She helped me reset the system and told me there is a problem with having more than one camera on at a time.  I am OK with this for now since I have a spare Summer monitor.  I have not synced them since like their customer service asked me to do.  I will do that this weekend and report what happens to Mobicam.  They did say they are working on a fix for this problem.  If you are planning on having more than one camera I would contact Mobicam first to see if they have the problem resolved.  If not for this problem I would recommend this.  Other items to consider.  The volume has 6 levels.  I would prefer more adjustment on the volume.  The power cord on the camera is only 6' long (I am estimating this, I did not measure it) which limits positioning of the camera to straight above an outlet if you want the camera high enough to see the entire crib.

It still 'overheated' and did not work properly with two cameras. I returned everything & will try a different manufacturer/product. It's too bad because I really liked this one. I wanted it to work for me.Orig Comments:This system has great promise but not until hardware bugs are ironed out. See details at bottom. I list more negatives than positives, but ultimately if not for the actual bug/glitch I describe below (which is soon to be fixed), I would be mostly happy with the system.On the plus side: it has good transmission range; shows a clear picture day & night; and is very lightweight.On the negative side: it doesn't work properly with multiple cameras (see below); \"quad mode\" shows up to 4 camera views **but without any sound** (nowhere in the product literature does it tell you this); changing functions (e.g. toggling \"scan mode\" on or off) requires clicking through onscreen menus rather than just flipping a switch; buttons on the unit produce a definitive \"click\" when pressed but sometimes it takes a second press to actually make the monitor respond.Two other small issues, not really negatives--just things I've noticed: cameras are SO lightweight that I needed to tape them down b/c the weight of the power cord was dragging & twisting the camera, changing what was in view. Cameras are capable of running on rechargeable battery power but the mfr does not yet have the required batteries available for sale (website says $9.99, coming soon.)The company has acknowledged some hardware problems with the initial production run of these monitors. I think the problems make themselves known only (or mostly) if you use more than one camera with a given monitor (company claims it has something to do with the monitor 'overheating' when receiving from two cameras.) Symptoms of the problem: monitor stops transmitting sound, power button becomes nonfunctional (cannot turn it off), unable to change 'channels' to see the other cameras, sometime a frozen image appears onscreen.  The remedy is to flip up the antenna on the monitor & push a paperclip into the little 'reset' button. That will restore functionality. However odds are the symptoms will reappear. If you're trying to monitor two children (cameras) throughout the night, this product is not reliable for you (until they replace the monitor) since at any point the sound might conk out.The company is taking names & contact info of users who have these problems & claims they'll send out replacements this week.

We're so happy to have finally found one that works!  We've been using it every day for about two months now, and it works wonderfully.  When looking for a video monitor, I wanted to find one that was interference-free with a good working range.  This monitor is it.  I know that each home situation is different, so not everyone will have the same experience, but I can't say enough good things about the Mobicam DXR.Specs on how we use the monitor:-We have a two-story home. Most of our activity is on the same level, although we do go to the other level several times per day.-We have DSL with a wireless internet router as well as a 5.8 GhZ cordless phone system.-The distance between the camera on our child and the monitor screen is approx. 45 feet.Pros:-Large monitor screen-No interference with wireless network or cordless phone system-Clear picture whether camera and monitor are on same level or two different levels-Great sound with vox option (which allows you to set the sensitivity to which the monitor will pick up your child's noises)-Monitor is lightweight and very portable-Camera has screw hole that allows mounting or use with a tripod-Feature set is rich and, although I don't need it now, option to expand to up to 4 cameras is niceCons:-Power cords for both camera and monitor could be longer-Unless I'm missing something, camera doesn't work without power cord (monitor does work without power cord, though)-Battery life of monitor when unplugged could be longer-Colors on monitor aren't super accurate or rich (although that's not really a big deal for me)More detail on our entire experience:We started out with the Summer Infant Day & Night Handheld Video Monitor.  That monitor frequently lost video (and sometimes audio), presumably due to interference with our wireless network and/or phone system.  In addition, one night, we saw our neighbor's child on our monitor instead of our son.  After some research, I learned that others have had this happen with the Summer Infant monitor based on the fact that it's an analog signal.  The Mobicam has a digital signal, so this won't happen.  For an interim solution, we turned to an audio-only monitor from Fisher-Price (Surround & Sound Lights).  That system NEVER worked once for us.  It gave us static consistently despite several attempts to reposition both the camera and the monitor.  Then, we ordered the Mobicam from Amazon after reading the available reviews.  This monitor has been a godsend.  We placed it in the exact spot that the Summer Infant monitor was, but we have had a far better experience with it in every way.

The video quality is good and so is the sound. I like that you can turn the video off so the bright light of the screen is off and still have the sound on when you sleep.  The battery on the video screen lasts about 6 hours so be sure to plug it in when you fall asleep.  The video screen shows the time which is great in the middle of the night.  The only downside is that there is no rechargeable battery for the camera so you can't just grab it and take it in the other room, you have to unplug and replug it in.  There is a spot for a battery so it must be in development.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice but not perfect", "Author": "balor123", "ReviewID": "R2WAPGUGJIPJBU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Mobicam DXR and the Summer Infant Baby Touch monitor. The Summer Infant monitor has a grainy image but so does the Mobicam. The Summer Infant is a bit worse but there isn't enough of a difference to decide to buy a different monitor. I suspect others are disappointed because the noise is more visible on the larger screen. Both suffer from the problem of a non-programmable voice activated image. The audio is always on with both so you won't be replacing the audio only monitor that you have and you won't be sleeping by them at night. The Summer Infant monitor is a bit smaller and lighter and the touch screen works well. I went with the Summer Infant monitor because of the motorized camera. It will be useful when my daughter converts to a bed and we need to find her after she wakes up.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "NO SOUND, even after exchanging!", "Author": "CAL", "ReviewID": "R260VWGZZQK9RP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I felt the need to comment on this monitor so others don't make the same mistake.  There is no sound, which completely defeats the purpose of a monitor.  Even after returning this and requesting a new one, they both had the same problem.

Despite the reference to a \"camera scan\" feature, you cannot, in fact, move the camera lens remotely. This makes the camera very difficult to properly install for even stationary monitoring purposes, and completely useless once your child becomes mobile.
