{"Reviews": [{"Title": "S120 first thoughts and vs RX100", "Author": "Just Chris", "ReviewID": "R10G4P3H70R2K1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this camera and have less than 100 pictures through it and although every year I buy one of these and end up returning it, it looks like this \"S\" might be a keeper finally.Like most of its predecessors it's built very well, feels good in the hand, and most of the buttons have good feedback. It has gotten a little more rounded over the years but I like it, square camera with smooth edges that don't annoy me in the pocket.Out of the pocket this camera is probably adjustability-overkill for most people that haven't dared of taking their camera out of AUTO mode.  Whether you like shooting in AUTO or you do choose to leave AUTO behind, the S120 rewards you with a very fast interface, fast response (focus/shutter), and the ability to view and share your images across other devices quickly.I am a Canon guy.  That should not be missed here because I am a little biased, but I have an iphone(5) for my day to day camera.  My weekend camera is a Canon 6D and a bag of L lenses. I bought the S120 to bridge the gap between the two. I am not a professional,  but sometimes I want professional pics without using my phone or lugging a big DSLR kit around with me - enter the S120.With the S120 Canon FINALLY offers a simple camera that seems to do everything I want well.  What do I want?- Ability to capture amazing pictures without carrying 20# of lenses with me.- Ability to hand my wife/kids a camera that they can use too.- Fast power up, fast focus, fast capture.- Great video if the situation calls for it, on the fly, no delay.- EASY way to transfer pictures to my phone (for when I do want to send them elsewhere).- Canon menus, because they make sense to me.It does all of these in my opinion, quite well.If you are looking for a camera that outshines just about anything else on the shelf under 700$ and can avoid bulking your pants pocket - this is the one.Whats in the box:- Canon S120 camera.- Canon (NB6-LH) battery.- Canon wall charger (CB-2LY).- Canon wrist cord.- Registration documents.- Warranty info.A couple other things I wanted to mention...WiFi -- It's actually useful now!  This model features a new wifi setup for transferring pictures to your smartphone. I have had this on (2) other units (S110 and EOS 6D) and never use it because it's a pain. With this model I just go into \"play\" mode on the camera, press the wifi button (up on the D pad) , it immediately asks what I want to connect to, I select \"smartphone\" and it says start the phone application and point it to this hotspot. Once I do that, I am on the phone browsing pictures. Scrolling through images (large JPEG) on the camera is pretty quick, downloading is pretty quick, disconnecting and getting back to shooting is just as quick.  Now you can literally turn wifi on, send a specific image over to your phone, turn wifi off, in the matter of a couple seconds and a few button clicks.I won't go into what the old way was, because if I could remember it I would actually use it!RX100 vs S120 -- Just before the S120 was announced I finally broke down and bought an RX100 (new).  Not the M2 model but the original, for 600$.  I loved the pictures it took, they were amazing amazing images.Compared to the S120 (in circumstances so far) they are possibly a little better comparing auto mode to auto mode.  What I like about the Canon vs the Sony is the Canon seems to capture more how I see things as opposed to the Sony which wanted to make everything look like a carnival if left untouched (it liked to make all the colors exotically vibrant from my perspective).  If this were just about images there would have been some tough decisions to make and hairs to split over this.The size and weight of RX100 to S120 it's no contest:S120. I can put the S120 in a pair of khaki's and go sit in meetings or walk around all day with no worries. The RX100 just felt too darn heavy, and it's larger lens tube sticking out from the front was annoying getting in and out of pockets.  The S120 is still a true pocket-friendly camera is what I am getting at.Build quality-wise both feel like finely crafted machines.  The S120 will remind you of other point and shoot cameras and its finish is something I would feel ok with putting in a bag with no case.  The RX100 felt like some sort of surgical tool, I mean in a good way - but I felt like putting down on a desk would damage the desk or possibly the finish on the camera.  Another strange thing is the S120 feels good in the hand and has some heft but nothing bad.  The RX100 felt a little heftier but in a way that I felt if I dropped it, it's life was over - it was just waiting for an opportunity to spill its guts. I would expect the S120 to take a small hit or some tumbling without ending it.Cost - Although money can be irrelevant to most photographic geeks when it comes to \"getting the shot\" , I didn't understand why the Sony was hundreds more. The \"why\" of this is in other parts of the review here so I won't get into it more.  I will just say I had a $1,000 budget for my perfect point and shoot, and now I have 550$ to go spend on something else.Software - I left this for last because I suspect this is where Canon bias comes in.  It is also something I suspect is different in the newer model Rx-100(M2) so may not be as relevant. The S120 UI is quick and also very efficient. The RX-100 by comparison was a little slow, and (at least for me) I never felt like I could quickly get to the settings I wanted to without forcing some customization. Neither is over-glitzy or annoying to use, but the Sony one just felt like it was fighting me sometimes when I would change something and then have to re-find it.I hope you enjoyed this review and I will update it as relevantly as is feasible.If there is more you'd like to see added or something I missed please comment and let me know, and thanks for reading this!-Chris", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most pocketable pro-quality camera you can currently get - picked it over RX100M II", "Author": "Alex B.", "ReviewID": "R14FOMF4T0U1W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this little camera. My previous camera was a Canon S100, and I loved it, too. But I really wanted the wi-fi functionality so that I could share pictures with friends and family at moment's notice and not have to wait until I got home (which, half the time I would forget to do anyway). The wi-fi feature works very well. You can upload photos directly to your phone or tablet by connecting to the camera's built-in wi-fi hotspot. Or you can upload pictures directly to the web by connecting the camera to a wi-fi hotspot with internet connectivity. Both ways work great.Before this one I bought a Sony RX100M II. Great little camera, but it wasn't really pocketable (yes, you could fit it into a jeans pocket, but you would probably hurt yourself if you tried walking with it). Also, the menu wasn't as intuitive or smooth. Plus, it was rather slow to navigate between images in playback mode, not something I was used to since owning the S100, which was very quick.You can't go wrong with either camera, and it really depends on what you value more. For me, the size and weight of the camera was more important than slightly better image quality of the Sony. I wanted a camera that I could bring with me anywhere and not worry about it, and this one is perfect for that.I had both cameras to compare side by side. In terms of portability, even though the size & weight look pretty similar on paper, it's no contest when it actually comes down to carrying the camera - Canon S120 wins. If I was going to carry the Sony, it would always be in hand or in a case. That defeats the whole point of having a pocketable camera. I might as well carry a larger & better camera if I'm going to carry it in a case.While the image quality was slightly better in the RX100M II (especially in low light), it wasn't *that* much better. After carrying around both cameras for a week, I definitely prefer the Canon in terms of portability. I could slip it into my jeans or jacket pocket and forget about it - not something I could say about the Sony.Both cameras are built like a tank - fantastic build quality. However, I think that the Canon would probably survive a fall onto concrete/marble floor better than the Sony, which has an articulating screen & huge lens.Pros of the Canon S120:- Small, lightweight, & most importantly pocketable!!!- Quite a bit cheaper than the Sony RX100M II ($450 vs $750)- Wider angle (24mm vs 28mm)- Longer optical zoom (5x vs 3.6x)- Touch screen is very nice - useful for manual focusing, menu navigating, picture browsing, etc- Faster, smoother, and more intuitive user interface - the Sony user interface felt much slower- Better optical stabilization - I noticed that I got more sharp pictures hand-held at night than with the Sony (on auto mode)- Built-in neutral density filter - can do really cool motion blur effects during daytime- Better automatic mode - closer to the way I want the pictures exposed - skin tones in particular are more natural looking- Very cool built-in HDR mode- Continuous 9.8fps burst mode until the card fills up - that's awesome! (very few cameras have this)- Clicky selector ring around the lens - the Sony also has one, but it's smooth (no click feedback), and therefore harder to select settings accurately. I found myself under-rotating or over-rotating the ring when trying to select settings on the Sony.Pros of the Sony RX100M II that I will miss:- Sweep panorama - great feature - I don't get why Canon still didn't get this one- 20MP - awesome detail - you can really use digital zoom with so many pixels- Huge 1\" sensor - better quality pics in the dark, but not *that* much better- Longer battery life - no big deal as extra batteries are small enough to carry- Extremely fast focus & shutter - a little faster than the Canon- Long flash range - you can also manually tilt the flash to bounce off of the ceiling- Articulating screen - can tilt the screen in different directions- NFC quick connect feature - very quick tap & connect on some NFC enabled phones", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect pocket camera when you don't want to bring a DSLR", "Author": "Mark Sanchez", "ReviewID": "R12I2HG3C3IV1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The S120 is a fantastic pocket camera to use when you don't want to carry around your DSLR.  For the last couple years the camera I use is a Canon DSLR.  Even though I have 2 older ELPH's, I always have used my DSLR until now.  The Canon S120 is pretty amazing for a pocket sized camera and works perfect as the camera to grab when you don't want to carry the big DSLR.  There are definitely some advantages and disadvantages worth pointing out.I've been using the S120 for 1 week now.  From power up to 1st shot takes barely 1 second.  Shutter lag is slightly longer than my DSLR (T3i), but hardly noticeable and completely acceptable.  I really like the amazing resolution on the LCD.  It almost makes up for not having a viewfinder since I can really see the focus on my shots, but the downside of course is that framing is so much harder without a viewfinder, but that's the tradeoff of a point and shoot.  The pictures look fantastic to me.  Low light shooting is pretty good with the lens at its shortest focal length and f1.8.  Zoomed shots in low light are pretty dark even with high ISO and should be steadied with a tripod or support.  Shots in good light are quick to focus and sharp when hand-held.  The built in flash absolutely stinks compared to speedlites, but such is the way with tiny built-in's.  I wish Canon would give you off-camera wireless like they do on their new DSLR's.I don't have the STM lens capability, so this not may be true to everyone, but I enjoy using the S120's video shooting much more than my DSLR despite the sensor size advantage due to contrast detection's focus advantage while shooting.  The focus and optical zoom is sharp and silent while shooting.  The 60p frame rate makes shots look a little artificially smooth, but things look very realistic too.The menu system is good and familiar to me as a Canon user.  I've tried out some of the filters and effects, and they work pretty well and are neat to use.  Bracketing and HDR options are great and very quick, as is the background blur mode thanks to the very fast shooting speeds.  Speaking of which, if you set a continuous shooting shutter, the speeds are as fast as advertised.  I'm using an older Class 10 SD card, made by Lexar, that isn't fast enough for my DSLR's video capture, but works great for all shooting modes on the S120.  So I'll say you definitely don't need as fast of a card in this camera as you do in your DSLR.Wi-Fi setup allows access to Canon's Image Gateway, the smart phone app (Canon Camera Window), and ability to transfer files directly through a Wi-Fi access point.  Initial setup take a little time, but once set, it's easy to use the Wi-Fi modes.  Battery life is a little short.  Granted I spent a lot of time playing around with settings and not shooting, but I could easily burn through a battery in an afternoon.  I'd rather have a compact camera with a small battery though, so it's a fair tradeoff.  The size of the camera can't be beat for this level of camera. There's quite a bit of mass to the solid construction, but it could stay in my pocket all day.I'm very impressed with the S120.  The initial price is pretty high and I debated just getting the S110 and saving $100, but in the end I decided that this was going to replace the use of my DSLR in a lot of circumstances, so worth paying a little extra.  The S120's compact size, 1/1.7\" sensor, f1.8 lens, fast shooting speeds, and features focused on DSLR users (like RAW and the selector ring) really won me over.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth carrying another device", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R1UYELY4B7GTHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose the Canon S120 because I wanted a true pocket camera that takes great pictures and videos. The review sites cover the S120 pretty well, so I'll focus more on why I chose it, how I use it, and how I like it. And since a memory card isn't included, I also ordered a 32 GB (80 MB/s) SanDisk Extreme SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 memory card for storage.  This card easily handles continuous shooting and the supported HD video modes.My previous digital cameras have also been Canon point and shoots (mostly ELPHs). I've gotten used to putting them in my pocket to take with me on trips and to special events. However, smartphone cameras have improved to the point where I started leaving my aging ELPH at home. But even the best phones have notable limitations, and there are times when I want much better pictures than what my smartphone is capable of taking.I still wanted the convenience of carrying a pocket camera, so I wasn't interested in a bulky camera body and kit lens, or even a compact that doesn't fit in my pocket. So I narrowed it down to the Canon S120 and the Sony RX100. The Sony's 1\" sensor was intriguing; however, this Canon's 1/1.7\" sensor is still substantially larger than anything that I've used before. Plus, the S120's image quality typically gets pretty good reviews.I decided that either the Sony or Canon would give me acceptable pictures, and it wasn't necessarily about which one takes the \"best\" photos. The price was important, but the size was the deciding factor. I looked at a Sony at our local Best Buy; and the (arguably minor) additional thickness made it too big to carry in my front pocket. Sure I could put it in a case; but if wanted to do that, I'd add the Fujifilm X20, Canon G16, Panasonic LX7, and Olympus XZ-2 to my list.I also take pictures of marine reef aquariums, so I appreciate the S120's manual controls which allow me to adjust the white balance, aperture, ISO, and shutter speed. Plus, the option to shoot in RAW format is real bonus for this type of photography. Reef tank lighting and moving fish can be a challenge for typical point and shoot cameras; however, I'm impressed with how well this camera handles these shooting conditions.Its 922,000 pixel, 3\" touchscreen is sharp, allowing for accurate manual focus adjustments. In addition, the S120 supports either manual focus magnification or peaking (which highlights the edges of objects that are in focus). This is helpful for extreme close ups. However, the autofocus is quick and you can use the touchscreen to select your subject. The camera will even continue to focus on that subject as it moves, or while you frame the shot.Previously, I had been using a Canon ELPH for travel, a Canon A-series (w/ some manual controls) for taking pictures of marine reef tanks, and a Cisco Flip for occasional videos. The Canon S120 replaces and improves on all three of these cameras. I sure won't miss juggling both the Flip and the ELPH around on vacations. Plus, the S120 is small enough to comfortably carry in the front pocket of a pair of loose fitting jeans.The pictures that I've taken have been good, even in lower light without a flash. I'm glad the flash doesn't pop up whenever the camera detects low light. I typically just zoom out to 24mm (f/1.8) to get the shot; however, you can easily activate the flash when needed. It has 3 different intensity settings, and does a good job preventing red eye (without using those annoying strobe flashes). Now I can finally take decent indoor and evening pictures.Even so, I wish the sensor was a little larger and/or the lens was a little brighter (especially at telephoto). Understandably, when shooting in low light without a flash, the photos can be slightly grainy or blurry. However, the processor handles high ISO well, and holding the camera against a solid surface can help reduce blur from camera shake during longer exposures. For me, this is an acceptable trade off for having such a pocketable camera.Some people use the Canon S120 when they don't want to carry a DSLR; but I use it when I want to take much better pictures and videos than what my phone can take. Now, instead of leaving my camera at home, I bring it along with me (in my pocket). It's a much better camera than my older ELPHs, but I basically use it the same way. Previous Canon point and shoot users (of any series) should be comfortable shooting quality pictures and videos with this camera.I'm pleased with this purchase, and consider it to be a good overall value. While not perfect, the S120 is the best camera that I've owned. It's not quite as small as an ELPH, but it's still small enough to carry in a pocket. And while I frequently use the Auto mode, its manual controls are invaluable whenever I need them (or if I just want to get more artistic). Finally, the ability to take quality 1080p/60p movies (in MP4 format) is the icing on the cake.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon S120 vs Sony RX100", "Author": "Jeff Aski", "ReviewID":

The Canon S120 comes close to what I like.I also own the Sony RX100, which has been the champion of point and shoots for me. What I don't like about the RX100 is the 28mm lens, slow f stops when you start to zoom, and the AVCHD codec.What I like about the Canon S120 is the 24mm wide angle lens, the MP4 codec for both 1080/60p and 30p and the amazing dynamic stabilization in video mode.What I don't like about the Canon S120 is the terrible battery life (30 mins on full charge), the slow lens when zooming, and the lack of manual control over aperture/shutter/ISO in video mode. Seriously Canon, why leave that out?", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "A point and shoot for professionals and amateurs alike", "Author": "Perry M.

The S110 and S100 do not compare to this one in terms of picture quality and features available. I have used the Powershot G15 and G1x as well and the picture quality is almost identical. For the size of this camera, I will be using this one over the G1x any time I travel from now on. It fits perfectly and comfortably in your pocket, unlike the G1x and G15. That alone is almost a game changer when on vacation.The build quality is quite excellent for a touchscreen point and shoot. It is made of the same durable texturized plastic that the G1x is made from, something most point and shoots are lacking. Since it is so new, I still dont know how strong the touch screen is, but it is really responsive and seems very durable. The physical buttons are very responsive and easy to use. You can easily hand this to somebody else to take a picture for you if needed without much instruction besides \"press the button on top\".The settings and features available are really exhaustive for a point and shoot. RAW compatibility, manual mode, f/1.8 aperture, 9.4 fps shooting, in-camera HDR, GPS, and tons of other features help take amazing photos for professional editing. Only major thing lacking is an external flash hot-shoe, but the included flash is not terrible and the sensor takes pretty good low-light pictures anyway. When using manual mode, the control ring is really a great alternative for the dial that DSLRs use.As far as amateur features go, the WiFi is the best part. Its really easy to use and you can easily transfer photos to your iPhone in seconds. Really nice for sending high-quality pictures to your friends or posting to facebook if you dont have your computer with you and you want to free up some space on the memory card.The video quality is just as good as the G15. I could not tell a difference between the two at all.The startup speed is a little longer than most DSLRs, but still good for a point and shoot at about 1 second.This camera will be relevant for a while. The features and picture quality are simply amazing for the size of this thing.

This camera performed admirably for every scene I could throw at it, including low light shots. I am not a professional photographer or reviewer, so I will leave you to Google for good reviews, which there are a few. I will only comment from the point of view of a normal user.Image quality is, as stated above, excellent. I took some beautiful images with this, which my friends remarked were near professional quality.Build quality seems extremely good. Its a solid little camera with very little plastic used. Its just about the perfect weight, and the size is perfect. Small enough to comfortably fit in your pocket, without being too small to be comfortable in use.The LCD screen is beautiful. And if you need a better view, you can connect it to your tablet or smartphone via the WiFi connection, which worked very well. The Canon CW app for iOS 7 worked very well and never let me down. It even allows to attach location data from your smartphones GPS.The only drawbacks: NO PANORAMA MODE. Don't look for it. Its not there. Big shame, I could certainly have used it to great effect where I was. I had to fall back to my iPhone 5 for that function. Also the battery life is mediocre. Plan to get  spare battery to keep around if you are gonna see heavy use. I nearly ran out of juice one day, and you can't charge it via USB while its in the camera, this would at least have let me juice it back up with my travel charger.I am keeping this a five star review because the pros outweigh the cons heavily, but this is more of a four-and-a-half star product.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "S120 to go with the RX100", "Author": "Atari44", "ReviewID": "R37B9PFCQQU2AL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Won't rehash most reviews, but I bought this for its video capabilities and to complement my RX100 Mk II.  Like a reviewer said before, the video image stabilization is amazing.  Videos when walking are fairly stable and are watchable compared to the RX100 when walking around.I also had the S110 and original RX100.  I bought this for the upgrade in video to 1080p 60fps and 30fps.  The S110 maxed out at 1080p 24 fps.  The RXs can shoot 1080 60p video in AVCHD, which plays choppy on older laptops - (mid spec'd laptops 4-5 years old).  But the RXs video quality is better in lowlight, evening situations than the S120.  Much less noise, very clean picture whereas the S120  gets very noisy in lowlight.  In daylight, the S120 is clean and sharp.  So, the RX100 wins in video quality in lowlight and the Canon is just as good in daylight and but better in stabilization.For photos, most review sites can give detailed image comparisons. Imaging resource, cameralabs, or dpreview etc.. In daylight the S120 shoots nice pictures with good detail. It's not as sharp as the RXs, but that's only seen when pixel peeping. In lowlight the RXs resolve more detail and are less noisy.  I would say I didn't like the lowlight high ISO pics from the S120.  They were noisy and \"mushy\".If you're a S110 owner and want 60 fps for video, I'd say go for it. That's the reason I upgraded.  Overall, the S120 looks and performs like a better camera.  The body finish is smoother, the control ring turns easier, and its buttons are bigger and rounder, which makes it good for underwater shooting.  I put the S120 into a Dicapac underwater bag and accessing the buttons and pressing the shutter was easy.  Burst mode in this camera is extremely fast, much faster than the S110.  The speed of operation seems zippier over the S110.  Battery life is about the same which isn't really good, couldn't get through a day of shooting without it running out. The S120 uses NB-6L, a change from the S110.  Spare batteries for the S120 are definitely recommended.Uploading video clips to a smartphone or tablet via WiFi and then to Facebook or Instagram works really well too.  The video quality and stabilization beat that of a smartphone or tablet.  The video gets compressed when transferring via WiFi to a smart device so file size isn't an issue.  Miniature mode video and certain filters are pretty fun too.  Using this underwater or on a mountain bike trip is definitely possible.  Makes this a nice multipurpose camera.If you're not into video but want a good pocket cam, Fujifilm XQ1 just came out as an S120 competitor. It has a bigger sensor and Fuji is gaining popularity with their new sensor design.  Might be worth a look. The video I believe is just average, but it's being praised for its picture quality and color.Overall, I like this camera, I'm happy with it, I'm glad I upgraded from the S110 because it has 1080 60fps and 30fps video.  Also it's a nicer camera to handle and the burst mode and operation speed is faster.  So it feels like it's an overall upgrade rather than an refresh of the older model.  And if this had come out before the Sony RX boom, I probably would have just stuck to this camera for my pocket camera.  If I could, I'd give this camera 4.5 stars.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth the Wait, a Truly Great Pocket Camera!", "Author": "Don Mago \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZJUN4EG9AN0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, here's my take on the wonderful Canon S120. If that opening seems a bit balanced in favor of the S120, it is meant to be. This is the camera I have been waiting for. In fact, I pre-ordered my S120 on September 8th, thirty days before it was forecast to be available on Amazon. I got two notices before the order became final. I received a shipping notice and the camera subsequently arrived via Lasership in perfect order and one day earlier, October 7th, than estimated. Through tracking I found I might not be home when the camera arrived and called Lasership to ask the driver to leave it on my doorstep. Lasership contacted the driver directly at that minute and made it so, a great shipping company.Now for the S120, I am an amateur wanting RAW format and HD, high quality, video in a pocket camera with above average low light capabilities. I also wanted Wi-Fi. I had looked at the Sony DSC-RX100M II but was scared away by the very high price point. Just as I was about to settle for less, Canon announced the S120 which met all of my criteria and then some. I already have a Canon SD 500 and a SD 990, both top of the line pocket cameras but each lacking in HD video and RAW format capabilities. The Digic6 processor put it all over the top for the S120. My expectations have so far been met.For anyone wanting fantastic, very professional results, the S120's built-in special effects, modes and scenes will deliver surprisingly pleasing results with little effort. The High Dynamic Range setting almost eliminates any need for adjustment of brightness, contrast and saturation, effortlessly delivering print-ready photos right out of the camera. The front-located Control Ring around the lens can be set to control several different functions and is knurled, sized and located to make it very easy to control while shooting. I like to use it for step zooming.The videos and photos can now be set to the same, matching aspect ratio (16x9 or 4x3), making videos using photos and video clips very easy to assemble. Speaking of video clips, the very handy Hybrid Auto Mode simultaneously records both a still shot and a short 2 to 4 sec video clip for each shot taken. I am currently exploring this interesting feature which I believe will greatly enhance the videos I assemble.Some downsides I feel are worth mentioning. First there is the lack of a remote audio socket. The auto wind noise reduction feature of the built-in stereo microphone works only marginally well. Users of the S120 that want high quality sound to match the very high quality (HD and 60 fps) video may want to invest in a stand-alone recorder such as the Zoom HN4. I don't yet have one of these and am using the quality cassette recorder from my old stereo set for indoor sound recording.I got the Wi-Fi setup to work but still have plenty of questions on using the system. The Canon instruction booklet (comes with the camera) and Canon User Manual (available only as a *.pdf file) provide enough instruction to make the system work. However to ensure the system is working securely I feel one should be familiar with the meaning of the terms like SSID, WEP, WPA, MAC (Media Access Control, not the Apple Mac), IP, DHCP, etc. I have made the system transfer photos and videos to my PC but still harbor concerns about the possibilities for security leaks. Perhaps someone could address this specifically in another review.As for accessories, I recommend a remote power supply, ACK-DC40 or equivalent. It fits easily to replace the battery. In my opinion there is ample room for most tripod bases to hold the camera and connect the power supply. Others have said this is a problem, I think not. The distance from the mount screw center-line to the outside of the connector on the bottom of the camera is 1 1/2 inches, allowing a tripod base of at least 2 3/4 inches square to be used.I purchased a Sandisk Extreme 32 GB 80MB/s Class 10 UHS-1 memory card which, based on present experience, will be very adequate for any full day of shooting. I plan on getting two more equivalent cards but at 16 GB each. Extra batteries are a must. Based on the large number of positive reviews I bought a Wasabi charger and two spare NB-6LH batteries on Amazon. I will report if any problems in a followup. In any case, at minimum, I will carry one spare battery at all times.The OEM PSC-900 case is a perfect fit, looks great, and is handy to use. The case loops onto my belt and in locations where I worry about having someone rip off the S120 I first run the hand strap under my belt, the camera through the hand strap loop, then place the camera in the case. I can still fairly quickly pull the camera from the case and un-loop it to shoot. The little inconvenience is worth the extra security. There is little protection from rain or dust with this case and in wet or damp situations I place the camera and case in a zip lock bag and into my pocket.Bottom line, this is a great camera and worth the upgrade if you want a true pocket camera and plan to take many photos and videos. Pros and amateurs alike can produce very high quality photos and videos under low light conditions. I feel many pros will find this a better choice for freedom while traveling and still getting top quality results. The S120 compares favorably almost all along the line to the much lauded Sony DSC-RX100M II at 40% less cost.Bob", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buy this camera!", "Author": "lng", "ReviewID": "R28YTYA3BK2BA3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Canon G15 for about a year and loved it, but with a curious toddler and a baby on the way, I wanted something that I'd actually be able to carry with me wherever I went.

I was in the market for a new portable camera with RAW and after comparing the Sony RX100 to the Canon S120, I decided to go with the S120. I was hesitant to go with the S120 because it looked exactly like the S90 and I wanted something different but I've discovered that the S120 is a completely different beast!Here are the things that have made this upgrade a worthy investment:1. High Resolution screen: The S120 has a 922,000 dot 3 inch LCD screen, almost double the S90's. Colors are richer and details are sharper!2. Built-In Wifi: I like to share lots of photos and photo collages on facebook and instagram. The S120 allows me to import high-resolution photos into my iPhone with ease. My instagram uploads never looked better (no more grainy iPhone selfies)! I had to snoop around to figure things out as the instruction manual and online blogs offered nothing. If you want simple instructions, I've provided them below.3. Faster overall usage: The shutter speed is fast and the camera's burst feature is awesome (9.4 fps).4. HDR mode: The HDR mode is very useful for scenic, high contrast scenes when you want all the details and shadow areas to come forth!5. Wide Angle: The focal length is 5.2\u201326.0mm (or 35mm film equivalent: 24\u2013120mm). This is slightly wider than the S90 and the Sony RX100. It may not seem like much but it makes a big difference when shooting various scenes.6. Versatile: I've clumsily dropped the camera twice already (once on asphalt and once in a restaurant) and despite some cosmetic scruffs, the camera works great.Downsides: The battery life on the S120 is definitely shorter than the S90. Be sure to buy a couple of generic batteries for the S90/S120 and carry them with you.How to Import Photos into Your SmartphoneDo not use Canon ImageGateway, you will waste your time with a registration system that doesn't even work (as of April 2014).1. To start importing photos into your smartphone, you've first got to set it up. Do this at home on your wireless network. Connect your smartphone to your wireless network. Connect your camera to your wireless network. Take a few photos, go into playback mode on your S120, press up on the spin dial, select \"Add a Device,\" and then follow the prompts to add your smartphone onto your S120.2. Go to the Apple AppStore and download an app called \"Canon CW.\"3. Once your smartphone is setup and recognized by your S120 camera, you have two options to import photos. The first option (at home on your wireless network): Go to playback mode on your S120, press up on the spin dial, select the smartphone icon, and the camera will begin searching for the smartphone on your wireless network. Turn your smartphone on (make sure it's connected to your wireless network) and open the \"Canon CW\" app (your camera will say \"Start dedicated app on target device\"). The app should recognize your camera and allow you to preview the photos. Select only the photos you want to import. If the app doesn't recognize the camera, try quitting the app and open it up again.The second option (on the road with no wireless network): Go to playback mode on your S120, press up on the spin dial, select the smartphone icon, and the camera will create a wireless access point. Turn your smartphone on, go to your network settings, and then select the access point that your camera has created. Then open up the \"Canon CW\" app and it's the same as above.I hope this helps someone.

Many DEFINITE improvements over my previous Canon S95 from 2 years ago. Speed to turn on, speed to focus, speed to snap a photo, speed to recover and snap the next photo, etc. are AMAZING. Right out of the box these are the fundamental features that are most important and noticeable in my opinion, and they are substantially better than previous models. Finally, you can shoot a photo and IMMEDIATELY shoot the next photo. Of course it doesn't hurt that the SD cards are faster now as well. No point fooling around with cheap SD cards. I bought a SanDisk Extreme PRO 32 Gb (95 MB/s up and down) SD card, so I'm sure this helps.I notice the lens in this camera allows it to take non-flash photos in much darker conditions, so the flash does NOT automatically pop up all the time like the old one used to.

It's been awhile since I've written a review for Amazon so definitely I wanted to let everyone know this is one of the best pocket cameras from Canon. I loved the S95 but unfortunately it has not functioned for me lately so I decided to take the jump for the S120.The S120 low light function is brilliant, I'm amazed at the night scene setting where I'm able to get a fantastic picture when there's very little light around. I'm mainly using the camera in Auto mode and it does very well for me.Pros1. Wi-Fi very handy when needing to transfer files2. Fantastic low light capability3. Compact and Lightweight fits perfectly in my pocket4. Takes pictures really quickCons1. The battery does not last very long, within 30 minutes after recording the low battery light blinks already2.

It shares its electronics with the larger G series cameras.What defines \"decent?\" The lens is fairly well made, if a bit fuzzy in the corners on full wide angle shots. The body of the camera is made of this remarkable, new material, called \"metal.\" The metal body gives the camera considerable weight and heft. The screen is fairly large, boasts almost 4 times the resolution of other camera screens, and is touch sensitive. The camera interface is a combination of touch, buttons and rotating rings. It's really rather well thought out.Above all, the S120 features a 1/1.7\" sensor for lower noise per given ISO sensitivity level. Aside from lower noise images, the larger sensor makes fewer demands on the resolving power of the lens. In practice that means you can use slower lenses, or higher f ratios.Most ultra compacts use a 1/2.3\" sensor. The upside to the smaller sensor is you can use a smaller lens and other parts to achieve similar results. Therefore, it is all the more remarkable that Canon managed to keep the size of this camera down. They managed it by shortening the overall focal length of the lens. Yes, this is a 5x zoom, but it zooms from 24-120mm, rather than the more typical 28-140. They also gave it a fairly long focal ratio on telephoto shots. While f5.7 is faster that what is offered on an ultra cheap camera, it's still pretty slow.What does increasing the camera size give you? Look at the G series cameras. Aside from a not-so-great viewfinder, you get a larger lens. Not only is it longer (28-140), it's faster (f1.8-2.8), too. The greater lens speed carries with it two advantages. First, you can shoot in dimmer light. Second, because faster lenses deliver higher resolution, the G series cameras can take full advantage of the sensor's 12 mega-pixels throughout the zoom range. The S120 can take some advantage of 6 mega-pixels at full telephoto zoom. I'll exaggerate a bit (but only a bit) and say that the S120 is actually a good 6 mega-pixel camera.To put it baldly, the G series is significantly better than the S series for taking pictures, unless you want a very small camera. If \"size matters,\" then the S120 is the best game in town.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best truly-pocketable hiking camera I've owned", "Author": "peacefrog", "ReviewID": "R1DX3TPHGLAGV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a landscape hiking camera this is a real winner.

It does what it promises, and does it well. I have to admit, though, that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the lay of the land.The S120 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 12.1 resolution (megapixels), and x5 zoom. Probably the most important point for this class of cameras is the sensor size, which is 1/1.7 inch CMOS-type. That is just a number, but one that matters. Most point and shoots have a 1/2.3 inch sensor, which is a couple of steps worse than the S120.It does not have a viewfinder, which many in its class don't. The ISO rating is 12,800 which makes it work better in low light. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control manually both the exposure and the focus. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen has a 922,000 resolution touchscreen, and the burst rate- for fast action- of 9.4 is a great feature. Few cameras in its class have a burst capability that delivers like this one. The camera also does RAW processing which would matter if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. And all this with a light camera weighing only 217 grams.Overall, great camera.

Opinions and claims abound. High praises and major put downs can be found about any camera by any company. There comes a point when you have to decide what you expect a camera to do, and how skillfully you are able to make use of the camera in you hands.I own a Canon S95 and now an S120. The S95 captured very satisfying images but picked up a bit of dust on the sensor which I could not dislodge, and the cost of having Canon do it is prohibitive. If not for that I would still be shooting the S95, but having said that the S120 has some nice improvements in every area, but will the images be remarkably different or somehow better than the S95? And that is always the question; will the next camera make your photographs better? The answer is maybe and probably not. Here's why.A camera can only capture what you compose. What the camera can capture is the result of what you see and how you see it. If your objective is to record images to remind you of a moment, or to share with others, those images exist in you, and a camera can only record what first exists in your imagination as you compose a shot. In other words, a camera is perhaps the least important factor as long as it meets the most basic requirements of a camera. You,the photographer, are the most important factor. You are the best lens. You are the ultimate sensor.In the hands of an inspired photographer the S120 can capture remarkable images, and to the eye of the vast majority of people the images the S120 can record are ultimately satisfying, and considering that you can have it with you at all times makes the S120 a perfect camera. That is what I think of the S120, I think it is a perfect camera, and I thought that about the S95 as well for this simple reason; they both record what I see, and what I hope others will see. That is what a camera can do, but it doesn't do it by itself. You make the camera amazing.

If nothing to sway me has come out since, probably I would. And I would still have the same regrets.  Mostly my review discusses the absurd documentation format; there are other extensive reviews of the camera itself.  If you use the camera intensively, on an ongoing basis (as a professional would), you'll learn it well enough and soon enough.  If you use it for only one type of photography, you'll probably find it capable and won't need to learn all the other features (although in that case, this may be more camera than you need, or a specialized model might serve you even better). But if you use it now and then, in a wide variety of situations, it will be frustrating at many times.Canon seems oddly insensitive to this user need. A new example: I figured, hey, load the manual (or key pages) into the camera, so it's always there and I can read it right on its screen! But printing the manual and shooting each page is not the best way to do that (a waste of color ink, loss of sharpness, etc.). Shooting the PDF pages off the computer screen, even a very high res one, is possible, but awkward and results in moire.  So, I figured, import it into a PDF converter, or a PDF reader that can save pages as JPEGs, or make JPEGS by importing into Photoshop.  Rant over, right?  NO -- CANON HAS PASSWORD-PROTECTED ITS MANUAL! You can do nothing with the PDF except read it in a PDF reader in Canon's format, and print it, in Canon's format. I've worked with countless PDF manuals for consumer and professional products, and have NEVER encountered a \"secured\" PDF manual from any other manufacturer. Canon Support says they do this with all their manuals, because they're copyrighted. Does anyone get the point in that? They're protecting against who doing what?A couple other recent observations:* I use Canon's software to download my photos.  Contrary to claims, the vertical shots come out horizontal, requiring me to have Windows rotate them.  I will check further into this.* When the camera is connected to your computer, disconnect it as soon as you are finished with your task. Apparently the camera will not go into sleep mode, and you'll deplete the battery rather quickly.  Canon's AC adapter is too awkward a rube goldberg contraption to bother with for this. (Remove battery, insert dummy battery (provided), into which you plug the cord. The cord, protruding out the bottom as it does, interferes with resting the camera on its base and might interfere with your tripod head. When done, replace the real battery.)* Apparently it would be possible for Canon to enable the current S120 to be operated remotely by a smartphone, by updating software or firmware. There is, I think, already an unauthorized aftermarket hack for this (which I haven't researched in detail). I hear they have recently enhanced some other existing products via software. If you would like Canon to enable remote operation in your S120, maybe it would help to let Canon know. My guess is they don't want to cannibalize sales of the G16, which already has this capability, but it would be a nice goodwill move.It seems Canon has great camera engineers, too many lawyers, sufficient pleasant US-based tech support people, probably a lot of professional-relations experts, and one overworked soul in a hidden-away Consumer Satisfaction office that nobody hears.=========================================================INITIAL REVIEW:Let me start by noting that I've only had this camera for a few weeks of occasional use. So I'll let other reviewers discuss the actual camera.  This is mainly about its documentation, which falls far shorter of excellence than the camera does.  I'm not new to photography, and maybe with this camera that's a handicap. I used Canon SLRs for decades and many other film cameras, but my digital camera experience is limited to a couple of relatively early models, both by other makers. I also have experience at writing spec sheets, instructions and product descriptions, so I know what's possible. Canon is surely up to the task of producing documentation that is more usable than this.  Also, please note that although it may seem I'm coming down too hard on them, to Canon's credit they have already approved and posted a version of this review on their own site, and I would not be surprised if many of my complaints and suggestions could be directed as well at other manufacturers.  While shopping, I was told that electronic-only documentation is the way things are headed.----------------------------------------I also want to make another thing clear: After hours and hours of research, and talking and trying out half a dozen very close contenders in this and nearby categories (including the Canon G16, G15, SX280 and cameras by other manufacturers), I remain confident I chose the camera I want. One of the key items on my wishlist was manual operations -- for versatility and in hopes of reducing the shutter lag that apparently every digital camera this side of a high-end DSLR must suffer. Also important was the ability to quickly make manual settings by way of actual buttons. This is a good camera for that reason, too, once you get to know them.Now if only I could figure out how to use those buttons. NO PRINTED MANUAL? Canon, what are you thinking? Apparently Canon once planned to print it, because it is laid out in a totally non-printer-friendly format (about 9x5, each page having two columns), and comes to 216 pages -- divisible by 4, as a printed booklet would probably be. Even using a popular PC printer utility and an automatic duplex printer, I am unable to get this down to a smaller size. Printed on average-weight paper, it is heavier and four times larger than the camera! What is the point of a pocketable camera when its manual requires a briefcase?So, I've tried accessing it on my smartphone. Not that much more convenient. Because it's a PDF, not formatted for the phone, it's hard to read and navigate. The internal links work if you zoom in enough, and it may be searchable, but manual navigation can still be a pain, harder than simply flipping through pages. (Your experience may vary, depending on app.) Canon put all this effort into wi-fi capability, yet has no doc app? No Kindle/Nook version? At least give us an RTF version in standard page-size format, so users can reformat according to their needs. But we'll never be able to print on paper as thin as Canon can, and compact binding will still be a hassle for most people. I realize the camera's price point is an important mark Canon must hit. So, if nothing else, include a self-liquidating coupon offer. I'd willingly pay US $5 to get a pocketable copy.And, while an electronic version is not a perfect substitute, why not take full advantage of an electronic document's lack of length limitations? I mean, this camera is often referred to as the Pro's pocketable, yet terms such as \"fill flash,\" \"computer,\" \"shutter,\" \"aperture,\" \"priority\" and \"focal length\" do not appear in the meager index. Doubtless they are covered, but it's a guessing-game to figure out where. (Granted, if I happen to be sitting at my computer while taking pictures, I can search the PDF file. But even then, for example, the phrase \"shutter priority\" or even just \"priority\" is not found.)And while the instructions are reasonably intelligible, the discussion of most topics is VERY terse. There's a reasonable argument for not overwhelming the consumer, but again, since this camera is virtually in Pro territory, there's no reason the electronic manual can't be even half again as robust. (And I'll add that a reproducible electronic version would still be appreciated, in case the printed one gets destroyed.)The camera does come with a compact \"Getting Started\" guide. At about 140 pages (70pp per language, English and Spanish), it measures roughly 4x6 inches, 3/16 inch thick. Its first half will get you set up to shoot, take you through shooting your first photos, looking at them on camera's screen, and erasing them. The second half is on setting up the wi-fi, including even how to send photos to another camera, and how to download photos to your computer USING WI-FI. There Is NO coverage of how to download photos over a (not included) USB cable. In fact, even in the PDF, that isn't covered till page 174, in the \"Accessories\" section. (Don't confuse this \"Saving images to a computer\" to the discussion having the same name in the wi-fi section.) Both these discussions assume you have downloaded Canon's software, which is discussed at the start of the wi-fi section.All this focus on wi-fi, wi-fi, WI-FI, and yet no wi-fi remote-control capability (which some reviews have erroneously reported)?Canon, what are you thinking?Partly as a result of the camera's extensive options and capabilities, partly as a result of Canon's crippling our ability to learn them, I'm a long way from getting to know the S120 well enough for a comprehensive review. But it may help some users if I mention these stumbling blocks, which are easy to get past if you're aware of them.* Read the first 20 pages of the manual, to be sure you understand which buttons and dials the manual's symbols refer to.* If you do that, you'll know that on the Modes dial, \"Tv\" means Shutter Priority and \"Av\" means Aperture Priority. I belabor this point so that you won't forget.  Again, what was Canon thinking?  \"Let's avoid terminology that's been used for decades and and instead call shutter-priority 'Time Value'!\"  Maybe they figured novices would think \"Ap\" means \"Automatic program\"? (That works both ways; you can imagine what I first thought \"Tv\" is for.)  TIP: Actual Automatic mode is highlighted in green.* One way to print the manual (so far the most compact way I've found) is to center the page on an 8.5x11 sheet (so that duplex printing will print both sides in register), allowing about an inch for binding (do a test sheet). If your printer doesn't do two-sided printing automatically, be VERY careful that it does not skip a sheet (manual feeding might be advisable). Print the cover and last page on heavier paper if you can. Trim to size, allowing generous binding margin. Clamp using binder clips. Work some glue into the binding (I brushed on some contact cement). Drive 1/2-inch staples (you do have a heavy-duty stapler, right?) generously from both sides (they won't fold, but should hold for some time). After drying, cover the spine and staples with good quality duct, shipping or fabric tape. You might find it easier to carry by rolling it up -- comes to about the size of a 35mm-format 135mm lens case. (Ironic, eh? You're looking at a pocketable camera in order to avoid that bulk!) That will induce some wear-and-tear (especially), but rejoice, you can always produce it again. Other binding alternatives are: binder clips; punch and use binding posts. It will be about \u00bd-inch thick.* When using the index, don't rely on only the instructions found at that page. Some functions are not available in all modes. So, also read the start of that section, for things the manual assumes you already know. (For example, the instructions on adjusting flash intensity assume you know they work only in \"P\" (Program) mode, not in \"Auto.\" Not knowing this drove me nuts the other evening!)* You can reassign the front control ring's function, but apparently only in P mode? Anyway, apparently not in Auto.* Might as well read at least the first several pages of each section right away (through Section 5, so you'll understand the various shooting Modes).* In Windows 7, at least, you can download images simply by connecting a USB cable and the camera will appear as a drive on your computer.* The instructions for downloading Canon's software are embedded in the wi-fi sections, but they apply even if you're not using wi-fi.  After following instructions to connect the camera, the software might start automatically. I had to use the second fallback approach (which worked okay).  You may or may not find the download and organizing procedures intuitive, but once I sorted things out, it worked.  If you're connected by USB in Windows 7, you might want to remind yourself why put yourself through this when you can just copy the images over.  Answer: The limitations of simply dragging them are listed on p 175 of the manual.  One of them is to retain raw formatting. Another is so that verticals will retain their orientation. So I checked the folder where my images wound up, and VOILA, there they were.  With all of the verticals shown horizontally.  Sigh.* For the software, the manuals send you to an \"/icpd/\" folder at Canon's site. (Amazon won't let me include the actual address.)  You'll need your serial number. From that address, you'll have to navigate several levels to reach the S120 section, and then choose the link to downloads. I can only guess why Canon doesn't provide a shortcut, via, say, \"/s120/\" (which currently produces a \"page not found\"), or with a cryptic character or two if they must.But no, as with providing more accessible documentation for the camera, that would make it easy.So, learning how to use the S120 to the full extent of its capabilities, in a wide range of tasks and situations, is probably going to take longer than I hoped.  Nevertheless, I'm still hopeful that by this time next year, I'll look back at this review and wonder why it seemed such a big deal.Meanwhile, if a competitor in this category does all this stuff better, will you please let me and Canon know?", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Takes great pictures, but really is a drag on battery power", "Author": "ray \"discodancnqueen\"", "ReviewID": "R1NWSE634BUID9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think if I kept it in Auto mode all the time then the battery might last longer, but I shoot in Tv and Av a lot as well as movie mode.
