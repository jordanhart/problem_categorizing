Have had NO problems after 4 / 5 months.  I had to add a sun shade as lens looked into the sun (north-west) in evening.  Would have happened with any other camera as well.

I have had this for a week now. Compared to another camera I am using \"VideoSecu Bullet Outdoor CCD Security Camera Day Night 26 IR Infrared LEDs With Free Power Supply 1Z8 $44.99\". The 600tvl 1I8 is a heavier larger camera has a wider lens a little sharper overall quality is a step up. for a sub $100.00 camera it has a solid feel to it. The night vision is great the LEDS.the picture is excellent wider and  better than the 39.00 video sec. Overall both cameras are what they are for under $100.00 I would buy another 1I8.
