I went for this unit, looking for a system that would give me something more advanced than what I used to get from the last camera I had before this, which was a Sony Cybershot WX-9 Point & Shoot digital camera, 16.2megapixel. Though I purchased it for personal use, It makes me feel like a professional photographer. From the compactness of the unit, the picture quality, the illustration DVD, the mini-tripod, the compact carrying case etc., it was worth the money spent. The Sigma 70-300mm lens is such a machine. I will recommend it for anybody.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera but accessories not so much", "Author": "Robert\u00a0Collins", "ReviewID": "R156FGQYDQ0SUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything came as ordered and I love theNikon D3200 and lenses. The rest of the accessories are of poor quality. Screen cover is very cheap film and the tripod is very thin and not sturdy at all. You are buying a Nikon Camera but the kit includes a Vivatar camer bag.Back to the Camera though as this is the reason for the purchase. I have always owned Nikons and this one did not disappoint. I have yet to use the camera at 24 MP and the pictures are still as sharp as any camera I have ever owned. The menu and controls are very easy to learn.  I know there are more expensive cameras out there but I could never justify spending more as with my skill level this camera does it all.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera....the price not so.", "Author": "Mom \"H. S\"", "ReviewID": "R317RYOB34OPV6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the first expensive camera I ever bought . I was always hesitating because I thought I could have the same quality out of a less expensive one. The main reason I bought this camera was my frustration when taking pictures of my children, since we know they can't stay still for more that a second and my Fujifilm camera took way too long to take the picture from the moment I pressed the button. I love this camera for that reason; with just a click I am able to take pics faster than ever before!!!  A big plus. Now, the downside is, this kit comes with so many extra items that are not really \"free\". I felt so disappointed when I saw this same camera and the Sigma Lens at Target for about $500.I don't see the need of all that extra-stuff, other than the tripod which I haven't used. So shop around first and look for whatever works for you.Other than that I highly recommend this camera. I bought it at the last minute because I was going on vacation and didn't want to risk the good memories!! Perfect for people with kids as it takes pictures fast and with great quality.P.D. The SIM/Memory card that came with the kit, didn't work, even though it was brand new. The kit comes with a 32G Sony memory. I just contacted customer service and was offer a 5% discount for the damage memory card, which I gladly accepted.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best Intro DSLR In Town.", "Author": "Writing Boy \"Edmon Armstrong\"", "ReviewID": "R2MA5YQRR10FHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Love, Love, Love this camera.

Nikon D3200- 24.2Mp - Great settings and easy to use manual functions2. Standard 18-55mm Nikon Lens - Takes great pictures in a studio3. Nikon Sigma Telophoto Lens with a Macro Lens function - Great for taking close up and faraway pictures4. 32GB memory card - Holds about over 300 pictures even if you take pics in RAW+Jpeg5. Tripod6. Compatible cords for your Tv(HD) and computer7.Memory card adapter in case you do not have a computer with an SD card lot8. Camera cleaning kit  -  I would not use this kit if I was you.

The camera itself is fantastic however the seller, 33 Street Camera I'm not happy with. First the camera bag that came with the package was covered in mold. The mold was all over the bag and just disgusting and finally I never received  The Jumpstart Guide to Digital Photography, No LCD Screen Protectors, No Memory Card Wallet and No Promo Code for 25 Free Prints. Whats worse, is when I went online to enter my warranty information on My Nikon Account, Nikon told me this Camera was a Grey Market Item and is not covered by Nikons Warranty. The only way to have it fixed would be to send it back to 33 Street Camera and hope they can get it fixed should anything happen. So be warned, this camera is not being sold by an authorized retailer. The definition of Grey Market Products is as follows...A grey market (also spelled gray market), or parallel market, is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer. So be warned, although the deal sounds great, there have been a lot of problems and worse off no warranty!Update... Turns out an associate was the problem with 33 street camera. I have changed my rating to 3 stars from two because I am still concerned about the camera being a grey market item, however I was told by 33 Street Camera that they offer a 3 year warranty. I am overall pleased with how 33 Street Camera resolved my problems. As soon as the owner/manager got wind of the issues I was having he immediately contacted me by phone to correct the problems. Unfortunately, it was just one associate that made things difficult. The owner/manager immediately shipped the missing items, offered a set of lenses/filters for macro photography to apologize for the problems and shipped them all overnight as well. I even told him he didn't have to ship overnight and that regular mail would be fine but he insisted on correcting the issue immediately. Overall I am pleased with their level of customer service and cannot fault them for one associates misgivings.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good package", "Author": "Bill Adams", "ReviewID": "R190D92VW85JLJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything in the package works fine.

I was excited to make the switch over to the Nikon and I'm glad I did.  The Olympus DSLR was a great starter camera and worked well, but the Nikon D3200 is so far my favorite.  The only downfall is that I thought that the 70-300mm lens would have the VR image stabilizer as the 18-55mm lens does, but sadly it doesn't, thus my 4 star only rating.  Plus in order for me to provide a 5 star it better be able to take the picture and process the editing as well.

We purchased this for Christmas of this past year and it arrived at our home just in time for the celebration of Jesus' birthday with our extended family.  Since the kit was so complete, we had no concerns over needing any other accessories and were able to begin taking pictures almost immediately (after the battery was charged).The larger lens is especially fun to use in outdoor settings to catch my young boys at play (without being caught with camera in hand!).One thing that has frustrated me in the past with other cameras has been the slow response time between pushing the shutter button to the picture actually being taken.  This camera has been super responsive and that has been especially good with my three active, young boys.This is a camera that I would recommend for anyone who is wanting to be able to take a higher quality photograph without needing to have a great deal of knowledge about high-speed photography.  The automatic settings are very easy to use and so far the captured images have been wonderful.  My understanding is that it is also great for those who do have such photographic knowledge since you can use it on a completely manual setting as well.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what she needed.", "Author": "shaun", "ReviewID": "R36XNB2W4M3KQY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Nikon D3200 along with the Sigma zoom lens for my wife who's father is battling throat cancer.

Lenses are good also - note that the telephoto does not have image stabilization.  However, unless you can get the entire bundle for the same cost as just the camera and lenses, I recommend buying the camera and any components that you want separately.The bag is OK, and the HDMI cable came in handy.  The tripod is useless.  Besides being flimsy, the first one we received had a broken leg.  It was replaced with another - the same flimsy model.  The legs stick and will barely fold up.  We aren't going to bother sending it back again.  Even when it works, it can barely hold the camera steady.  The first card reader was broken, and the screen protectors are low quality.Again, it is a great camera, but I recommend deciding what components you want, researching them, and buying them individually.
