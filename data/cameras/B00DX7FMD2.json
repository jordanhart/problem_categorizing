Also, inside was not the typical Sony packaging - camera was in ripped plastic bag, camera did not have the Sony product tag on it, warranty documentation as well as other papers were missing, and the included accessories were not new packaging (not in sealed bags or plastic but re-tied with twisties).Have not tried the product yet - waiting for a response from Discounts Jungle.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$555.99", "Features": "TRILUMINOS\nBUILT IN FLASH\n16.1 Mega Pixels\nFull HD 1080p\nE-mount", "Name": "Sony Black NEX3N/BMBDL Compact System Digital Camera with 16.1 Megapixels and SELP1650 Lens Included", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ob91rLLTL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DX7FMD2"}}
