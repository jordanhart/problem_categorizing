Hudson \"Fatherhonda\"", "ReviewID": "R1OZUPEEYRQ9BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Z2 for about a week and I am very impressed with it.  This is my fifth digital still camera (the last was a Sony DSC-S75).  Other reviewers have complained of poor image quality and noisy zooming during videos.  It almost seems as if they are talking about a different camera.  My Z2 has produced very sharp and colorful images (flesh tones are a bit oversaturated even at the \"natural\" color setting) and the zoom is COMPLETELY silent in the videos I've taken.  One reviewer said the videos cannot be edited, but that is not true.  The camera comes with Arcsoft software to do some crude editing on the Quicktime (*.mov) files, but it also allows you to save the video in other formats such as MPEG, AVI, and WMV.  In those other formats the Windows XP Windows Movie Maker will do additional editing.  I recommend you use the AVI version since it seems to introduce the fewest compression artifacts.  But you have to download the camera's firmware update (version 1.02, posted 04/23/04) at [...] in order to get the sound to transfer along with the video.  When you are at the site you have to navigate to the Z2 page and then select \"software.\"  Another virtue I've discovered -- the camera is efficient in its use of energy.The deficiencies I've found have to do mainly with downloading images and dealing with them once they are in my computer.  The Windows XP download wizard cannot rotate images that were taken in vertical format (as it was able to do with my Sony) unless I first rotate the image in the camera's playback display.  Images come in as JPEGS, with perhaps a bit more compression than I would like in the \"fine\" mode - the file sizes for these 4-megapixel photos are about the same as they were with my 3-megapixel Sony.  When I edit an image and then try to save it again as a jpeg, my Ulead PhotoImpact 6.0 software cannot compress the image as much as I may need.  And my Printmaster 7.0 cannot see the image, though other JPEGS come in just fine.  The workaround that I use is to save the Minolta's image as a Bitmap, close the bitmap file, then reopen it, and then save it as a JPEG at the desired level of compression -- and then Printmaster can see it.  Perhaps Minolta has done something with the EXIF data that these software applications cannot deal with.With a camera that generates such widely differing reviews it might be a good idea to buy it where you can return it easily.  I got mine at WalMart (Circuit City was out of them) for something like $50 more than the Amazon price, just so I could bring it back quickly.  But I'm keeping mine.", "Date": "May 18, 2004"}, {"Title": "been very pleased", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RKMN9G5WQZ96Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Z2 now for about a month. I have taken very many pictures low light, bright sun light, and about every other condition. It has performed very well. I pick this camera for myself because of price and the video function is the best but video is good only for those quick shots. Needs lots of memory. 512mb will get you about 5 minutes in high res. When using zoom near its peak you must have a steady hand. I usually brace my elbows but I have tripod as well. Outdoor light this camera is at its best. I think it out performs any in its price range. The video is perfect in this situation as well and I have not notice any zooming noise in my camera. With night pictures it is little harder to point an shoot. If you are automatic mode, it obivously more delay. It takes little more time to get a picture and video doesn't look very well. Night pictures can be performed well but with some time figuring out your controls. Cloudy days the camera still does very well.I have had no problems with using it with XP. I haven't tried it with a MAC. The flash is one of the brightest that I have seen on a digital camera in this price range. Lights up average size living room with no problem. I do a lot of wildlife photography and I must say that with the zoom I have been very pleased. I have also purchased addition lens but haven't try them in normal settings. The Z2 works very well outdoors with video and pictures. I do a lot of croping and my standard size is a 5x7. It has done better than I expected.Considering features and price, it is very good package and one the best camera in its range and is very lite. I tested for color hazing and it has a little, but it is not noticable to any professional that I talked too. However, this is not professional camera but you get some professional pictures out of it.", "Date": "May 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Minolta Dimage Z2", "Author": "pablocasal \"pablocasal\"", "ReviewID": "RDQJXVCD9YIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dimage Z2 feels good in your hands.  The grip handle has well spaced and placed buttons.  The neat LCD screen/viewfinder switcher option is very handy.  The LCD screen does not fold out for odd-angle viewing.  This camera will not fit into a pocket, but is surprisingly light.The controls are pretty intuitive, but also extensive.  They're a lot easier to understand than most VCR's.  Of course, this might be faint praise...Pictures look fine on my 17 inch laptop screen.  Since I do not print out my pictures much, 4MP is more than enough.  At half the price of the digital Rebel (and the like), I can live with half the megapixels of digital SLR's.  The 16meg SD card that it comes with is completely inadequate.  My 512 SD card might seem like overkill, unless you want to film movies.  Then, the 512 seems just adequate.The movie-mode is the best I've seen on a camera.  If you pick your spots carefully, you can film a wedding in both still and movie modes, and be pleased by both results.  However, the motor on the lense is very loud when employed during filming, and will be noticably picked up.  In other words, DON'T zoom while filming.  The 10X optical lense will make you forget the digital zoom.  If you must go for the digital gusto, unless you've got nerves of steel and hands of granite, use a monopod.  Z2's focus lock option allows you to properly compose your picture with your subject off center.  The focus is fast (if not quiet) and pretty responsive.  The flash is powerful (red-eye reduction), and there is a hot-shoe for a larger flash unit.The 2 AA battery (with AC power option) allows a lot of flexibility.  An optional battery unit is available that pretty much provides enough juice to run a small Irish village (excluding the pub).If you can accept that it is what it is (a consumer camera with lots of neat features in a well-thought-out package), then Z2 deserves its 5 stars.", "Date": "April 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "great for the enthusiastic beginner", "Author": "gmr2048", "ReviewID": "R1RS14O29I7QPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a little over a month and so far, I love it. It's got the full-auto (point-and-shoot) mode for the casual photographer/beginner, but it also has a variety of manual modes and advanced features like aperture priority, shutter priority, program mode, and full manual, as well as manual white balance for those interested in learning the art of (digital) photography.The two built in macro modes (close and *really* close) allow for excellent close-up shots. Despite having almost no experience in photography beyond point-and-shoot cameras, I was taking pretty good macro shots my first day with it (at least that's what mom said ;). The 10x zoom is great for the long shots. The 16MB SD card is useless (pick up at least 256MB). I still carry the 16 for a spare, but at the highest image resolution, I doubt I could fit 10 pictures on it.Do yourself a favor and buy the lens adapter ring and a UV filter for the camera. The UV filter can be had pretty cheap, won't affect picture quality, and will keep your built-in lens safe from scratches, dirt, and UV rays (evidently pretty damaging to camera equipment). And having the adapter, you'll be able to attach other filters as your need/skill grow. Oh, and get a couple of sets of rechargeable NIMH batteries too. They'll save you a lot of money. I briefly looked into the Konika-Minolta LI battery pack that's made for the camera, but being more than half the price of the camera, decided it was more expensive than I needed. At least for now. So far, my only complaints are: the battery cover door seems pretty flimsy. I'd like to see something more substantial. And, I'm not sure the idea of the mechanical mirror used to select the view through the eyepiece or on the display screen is wise. It just seems like more mechanical parts to fail in the future. Also, the use of the eyepiece won't prolong battery life as it would in most digital cameras.So, it's few faults aside, I give the KM Z2 a solid 5 star rating.", "Date": "April 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "Have yet to find anything wrong with this camera", "Author": "Neil", "ReviewID": "R2CMBSYVF4NVV9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been holding off buying a digital camera as I love my Olympus SLR camera but, whilst looking around my local camera store in February, I was introduced to the Z1 and was told that I should probably wait as new cameras were coming out soon.

Great price!", "Author": "Jack \"(Of all trades)\"", "ReviewID": "R3E8723VIEUL2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the third digital camera I've gotten, to replace an aging 1 Megapixel Sony Mavica with a 16X optical zoom.  I am VERY pleased with the results, having taken 1800+ pictures in the past three months with only a few minor glitches.The pros:- This is the first digital camera I've used that can take a sunset picture equal to any film camera I've ever used.- Very speedy- Awesome zoom.- Good battery lifespan (Using Duracell Rechargable ACCU batteries w/ 1 hour recharger)- Fairly lightThe Cons:- The camera has difficulties focusing if you use the zoom out on the water (if you go on a whale watch, don't use the zoom, or ignore the focus warnings - whales move much faster than you think!)- A tendency to focus in on the 'wrong' things - like a background when you're trying to capture a small thing (such as a bird) in the foreground.-The battery door is awkward to use - especially if you're rushing to change out batteries.  Once the batteries are in place and the door is put back, it is solid.  The best solution of course is to start out with fresh batteries.Tips-I have found that most of the 'jiggle' problems reported go away if you use the eyepiece - of course the further the zoom goes out, the harder it is to keep stable.  The digital zoom portion of it, like most digital cameras, is not very good, so try not to use it unless there is no other option.- I have gotten a 256 MB SD card for this - it can hold 200 images, although if you're taking pictures along the seashore, you can get 300 images.- Keep in mind that this is good for outdoors - indoors, a smaller camera with a wide-angle lens does better (I still tote my 2MP Canon Powershot A40 around when I'm our on a 'major' photo shoot to get the wider shots)If you're looking for a camera with a great zoom I would have to say this is one of the best currently on the market at an affordable price.", "Date": "August 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "K.

It's real easy to use, it's light, and the auto focus is quick.  From the time you press the shutter button to the time the camera takes the picture is lightning fast.  The Cannon Elph was a lot slower, causing me to miss action shots.  The picture quality is great!", "Date": "June 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "Brilliant camera--very few flaws.", "Author": "Dani Nymeyer", "ReviewID": "RWEIMIGLY7BX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for a few months now, and I must say, I am very pleased with the results from this camera.  The picture quality is just fabulous; they're high quality, and the colors are very accurate.  Even the simplest pictures taken have a professional aura to them.I love the zoom function on this camera.  It's very fast, in the past with other cameras I have always seemed to have trouble finding a camera with a fast zoom--but this camera has pleased me beyond words as far as zooming goes.  Not only is the zoom fast, but it is very silent.  A silent zoom always seemed like an important part of a camera, and I highly applaud this camera for that.There's not much to complain about with this camera--however, there are a few things that I am going to have to complain about...The batteries?  You need four AA batteries!  It's not so much that this bothers me because it makes the camera heavier--because the camera is so well built that you hardly notice the added battery weight--but what does bother me is that this means you have a lot more batteries that you have to carry around with you.  Although, since the camera has so many features, four batteries is hardly a bad thing.After months of owning this camera, and trying out every feature on it, I have only found two flaws.  The first one I noticed was the battery door.  I read plenty of reviews by other customers about the battery door being flimsy, but never did I think that it would be this flimsy!  The battery door feels as if it's going to break in my hands if handled improperly.  However, if you take caution while opening and closing the door, it should be just fine.The second flaw I noticed, was much more conflicting.  The positioning of the flash seems to be a little out of place.  You won't be able to notice this camera defect unless you are taking a close up macro shot.  When you take a shot too close, you will find that while the camera does take a stunningly clear photo--if you use a flash, a shadow from the lens will be left on your photo area.  Even if you don't use any additional lenses or filters the original lens with the camera will still be in the way of the flash.This flaw only occurs, though, when you are taking a Super Macro shot.  Regular Macro will work just splendidly.  It really is a shame, though, since the camera will allow for really close shots to be taken and still come out clear--it's just the shadow that appears when using a flash that ruins it.Those were the only complaints I had about this camera, other than that, I am very much pleased.  It's a great camera for the more advanced beginner to the intermediate photographer.  The picture quality never ceases to amaze me--it's just brilliant to see the photos that this camera takes.

Bought mine at a camera store.  When I first got it I was a little intimidated by it, but quickly learned how to navigate through the menus.  It's great!  I've been able to take some excellent photos with it, and folks have commented what great photos they are.  It has a fast shutter speed even without using the sports mode.  My wife took some photos of kids playing ball and it caught them swinging the bat and the ball in mid air.  I thought that was pretty good.  She has took some excellent photos the first time she picked the camera up.  It's easy to use.  I really like the progressive and continuous capture modes.  This makes taking photos of events that are occurring easy.  I love the 10x optical zoom, plus I don't have digital zoom unless I turn it on.  The only down side I've found so far is the photo software included is still a little intimidating to me.  I really haven't learned to use it yet.

The colors are bright and very sharp! I do a lot of traveling and this camera has yet to fail me. I bought it in the beginning of June and have taken it everywhere with me.The zoom feature is remarkable! I can be standing far away from a subject and the photo is still as clear and detailed as if I was two inches away. One particular detail I notice is when I am taking a photo of water or the splashing of water, it catches each drop in detail no matter how far away I may be. I've even caught a detailed photo of a hummingbird!Before purchasing this camera I did A LOT of research and it appears that this is the best professional camera out there for its price range. I would suggest it to anyone. I actually chose this camera over the thousand dollar models because it appears to be easier to take care of, but with just as many features.The memory card that comes with it does not hold many photos, of course. I purchased an additional 32 mb card and that did me fine until there was a sale for the 128 mb cards. I am using the 128 mb card now and get up to 280+ photos at the best quality setting.

The Dimage Z2 fit the bill with its powerful 10x zoom. (I need the zoom for swim meets and candids of my kids and dog.) The Z2 zoom works well. I was worried about comments people wrote regarding blurred photos using the zoom. I find that if you hold still (keep your elbows against your body to stay steady and wait until photo appears on digital screen) there is no problem. The 4.0 megapixels are more than adequate for my purposes and any more would use too much space on the SD cards.

I looked at many cameras before settling on this one and have to say that in the 7 months I have owned this camera, the camera has not taken a bad photo yet, now my shot selection, that is a different subject.  Here are the points that I think are important to know to a first time (and maybe veteran) user:Ease of Development: The memory card slips right into you computer with the adapter that is provided with the camera, and better yet, the card can be taken to Wal-Mart or Costco to have prints taken straight from the chip just like you are taking in film (only cheaper).  If you have an older computer without the proper ports (USB) then you can purchase an adapter to fit older machines.Clarity: The clarity of the images provided by the 4.0 megapixles is truely amazing.  You can zoom in and still have total clarity, better than any high quality film could ever provide.  The color of the images is true to life.  No more exaggerated colors like Kodak or Fuji films had... unless you want that which can be easily done on your computer, or where you have it developed.Battery: In the past, some cameras that I have used burned through the batteries in minutes.  The 1 megapixel camera I used 6 years ago used up 4 AA batteries every 12 shots.  Not that way with this camera.  The batteries usually last a couple months with normal use - 1 month with lots of use, and only takes 2 AA.Video:  While the video is not as versatile as my Sony digital camcorder, the quality of the finished product is better than than most television programs - not too many cameras offer this high a quality.Ease of Use: This camera is perfect for the beginner and the most advanced users.  From the simple point-and-click to advanced manipulation of the lens for exposure .Overall this is a great camera and I am very happy with the operation.  No glitches so far, and we love the shots we get at night with the use of a tripod.  The camera must have some sort of image stability because the camera moves when you hit the button but that does not show up in the image.", "Date": "December 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "A digital slr for less", "Author": "Stan Kotulak", "ReviewID": "R383TUX3Q0QVWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned the Konica Minolta Dimage Z2 for about a year and a half.

I had wanted a camcorder for recording the kids but a friend cautioned that expensive camcorders largely sit on shelves 99% of the time; a camera with video capabilities might be a better value for occasional video needs.My needs were very modest: 4-megapixel minimum, a decent zoom (optical of course) and the best video capabilities I could afford.  After reading reviews, I had initially settled on the Dimage Z3.  However, a timely online sale and much better (SVGA) video capabilities \"downgraded\" my order to the older Z2.PROS- A GT 10x optical zoom - apparently this raised eyebrows when it came out- TV-quality movies with a good built-in microphone- Color LCD display and built-in speaker for instant video playback- Quick startup and shutdown - no waiting- Uses nonproprietary batteries (4 AA), so you don't have to buy an expensive 2nd battery or run back home or to the hotel to recharge, as I have done with my Canon Elph- Downloadable firmware updates from the Konica website- Largely automatic and idiot-proofCONS- Plastic casing - my Canon Elph is all-aluminum and is of clearly superior construction- Low light levels defeat an otherwise good auto-focus feature- The flash must be lifted manually - but this is good when you don't want the flash on and don't want to cycle through menus to turn it off- Way too many features for me to ever appreciate - I would categorize the Z2 as a near-professional camera. It's not specialized enough for pros but is way too complex for everyday consumer-grade use. Again, not necessarily a bad thing.You will want to buy larger capacity SD cards (my high-speed 512MB SD cards, even when recording video, hardly ever fill up) and an adapter ring if you use UV or other filters.  On this last note, be aware that when I bought my Z2, Amazon recommended a UV filter that was the wrong size, and I bought it without verifying the size myself. I was unable to prove that the mistake wasn't mine (I merely clicked their link and added it to my shopping cart) and I got stuck with the restocking fee.

While taking some really close up macro shots, I found that yes, the pictures were coming out splendidly clear...but I've found that there is always a shadow.  The lens of the camera (even without any additional lens attachments) gets in the way of the flash--leaving a horrible shadow in the picture.  So, I cannot get as close to my subjects as I would like to because of the location of the flash; you can still get pretty close, though.

After getting this new camera, I could take shots of a concert from a seat far away from the stage, or take a super close up shot of a spider to see it's details.  The pictures are crisp and clear, and the auto feature where the camera selects the type of picture it should be (whether portrait, scenic, sunset, or some other situation) given the enviroment is very accurate.The camera is not that big of a camera either given that it is an SLR (sort of) and has a 10X optical zoom lens.  I measured it to be the length and width of the size of an average palm of a hand.  The price is nice, and if you hurry you get a $50 mail-in-rebate with the purchase of this camera.  If you open an amazon visa credit card, you get another $30 off the first purchase.  That can potentially add up to $80 in savings.  The price is around $270, so you can potentially buy this camera alone for under $200.  You will need a case and rechargable batteries (costco=>panasonic 2300 mAH rechargables=>$18), and that will add up to roughly about $230 with rebates and all (or $260 without amazon credit card rebate).  The batteries last quite long, and if you plan on taking short video clips, the camera provides VCD quality video as well (up to 640X480 on 30 fps!!).This camera is definitely \"upgradable,\" and by upgradable I mean you can add on a wide angle converter thing that lets you take panoramic type shots (widens angle of lens, which gives you a wider field of view when taking pics).  You can also add on lens filters to sharpen up those day time pictures with the sunshine and glare.This camera is definitely a must buy if you are just beginning to like photography (have an interest in it) and would want a camera that is simple to use, but provides excellent quality to pictures (4MP) and zooms onto objects from as far as 30-40 ft. with ease (and gives great details of that zoomed-in obeject).", "Date": "April 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not impressed at all!", "Author": "Jennifer J.
