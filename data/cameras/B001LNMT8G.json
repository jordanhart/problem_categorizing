Now the DVD is only 30 minutes and is very very rushed but if you dislike reading id say its not to shabby but if u read the first 50pages or so in the manual that came with the camera you get more info and have stuff explained better than in the DVD. Would rather get a lens filter than the DVD because i could have actually used the lens filters for a wile, where as the DVD was only good for someone who knows nothing about cameras and don't mind rushed explanations of how things work + they miss a lot of vital information in the 30min video that should have been there instead of some of the other things they put in it. Everything was all ready opened but nothing was scuffed or damaged in any way so it doesn't really bother me.All done and said - Great starter kit, comes with 2 good lenses, a decent/good stand (depends on personal preference on stands), comes with a good lens cleaning kit(thought this also had a lens filter kit in it but it doesn't!), a very nice carrying bag(a little small in my opinion but it works, just gotta cram stuff into it some what to get it to fit everything. i also recommend wrapping the lenses and camera in towels so as to add some shock absorbtion and to keep them from getting scuffed and scratched.), a SD card reader which is awesome if u don't have have one and u don't want to go through the hassle of hooking ur camera up to the computer constantly to get pictures from it(personal preference here again), comes with a universal screen guard with four guards inside the box, the SD card wallet they put in it is kinda worthless(in my honest opinion since it doesn't offer as much protection as the little plastic cases they usually come in) and that's pretty much everything!Hope this review helps you decide if its right for u! :D", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wonder for starter", "Author": "Stephanie Hasancebi \"Stephanie Tse\"", "ReviewID": "R2W4K7QFISPWE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have received this product recently and have now started to do it.  The kit includes all essential element for new-starter in the SLR camera world.  I used to only use pocket-sized point and shoot camera and this kit fulfills all my need.  With 2 very good lenses.  18-105mm VR is sufficient for a lot of occasions, the 70-300mm VR is a good complementary lens for zooming far objects.  One can also invest in a wide-angle lense, something like 10-20mm for capturing closed big object.  Then it's pretty much \"enough\" if we are not a professional photographer.One drawback though, the SD card is not a \"branded\" make.  Cheap stuff!  So as the bag and the SD card holder. One can absolutely live without, or even want to buy better one to replace them.  Otherwise Tripod is excellent, one extra battery (also non-branded) for \"emergency\" situations which is ok.I overall find this a very good set, has everything I need and the price is very reasonable too.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "excellent  buy", "Author": "Vance C.

She is in love with this camera.  It is easy to use takes amazing photos and the whole package was more bang for my buck than I expected, especially the tripod.  I spent about the same amount that I would have spent for just the camera and one lens in a local camera shop.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Nikon D90 DX-Format 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lens, and 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S \"VR\" Zoom Nikkor Lens + 8GB Deluxe Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EGrnK3NxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001LNMT8G"}}
