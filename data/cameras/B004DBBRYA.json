When I saw this bundle deal come up I bought a second one. Kodak came out with a newer generation, but from what I understand the new ones don't give you the option to change the battery, as it's now permanently installed, so I preferred the option to be able to switch batteries in the field. As far as the camera, it shoots HD in both 720 and 1080 modes. And the underwater feature is really fun. For what it is for the price it's an amazing deal.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera.", "Author": "welshdragon", "ReviewID": "R1U6VA5LV2X0CD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great little camera!, also shoots video and easy very robust in its design.I purchased it to carry in the tank bag on my bike for those times when you see the perfect shot.Very easy to use, lots of accessory's in the kit. Takes great pictures, and my wife leaves her more expensive camera at home and takes mine!
