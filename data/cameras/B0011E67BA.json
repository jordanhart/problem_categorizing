Woodbury \"twoody\"", "ReviewID": "R3TWAWX55RQCAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I recently upgraded from our Sony DSC-P8 to a Sony DSC-W130.  So far we are extremely happy.  We shopped around quite a bit before settling on the new cybershot, and spent a good deal of time trying out other brands.  In the end, the Smile Shutter brought us back to Sony.  It sounds like there is no way it would work, but it really does.  We have two young children that are remarkably hard to catch smiling.  With the new Sony, all we have to do is turn on the smile shutter and the camera does the rest.  So far, we haven't missed a smile with the 3 year (with teeth) and have caught a few of the 4 month old (no teeth).  It makes a difference.The other feature that has been great so far is the burst mode.  With my old camera, the missing time between shot resulted in a lot of blurring.  The new camera manages to focus each shot much better.  We played around with some moving targets, and the pictures came out great.  One major drawback of burst mode, however, is that you can't use flash.  I took a bunch of pictures indoors and the quality was ok, but not great.  The flash just turns off when you switch to burst mode.The video recording is great on this camera.  Obviously not camcorder quality or anything, but very good for what you'd expect from a point and shoot.  The sound quality still isn't that great, but much much better from my older camera.  It seems like it balances the audio in the first few seconds.  If the first few seconds are loud, the whole video will be softer.  If you start out soft, however, you bury the needle when it gets lounder leading to some distortion.  You also can't zoom while in video mode - something they don't tell you.The flash recharges after about 1-2 seconds, which is great.  It also is pretty effective for long distances.I like the menu configurations, especially now that I've had some time to play with them.Picture quality is great, but I'm upgrading from a 2MP camera, so it probably wouldn't take too much to wow me.  We took a ton of shots and were impressed at the level of detail when we zoomed in on our computer.Overall, we are very happy with this camera.  It has some limitations and problems, but for the money (and for being a point and shoot) it is great.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Shopped around; would buy it again; but be aware of minor issues", "Author": "Garrett Cook", "ReviewID": "R2LN91TK27OHJ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just bought this new from a local retailer.  Did a lot of research online comparing this model to some of Canon's compact cameras.  I'm not a photography buff so I wanted something that was small and not necessarily the \"best\" but would still take nice pictures.  I really like the features that it includes.  The 4x zoom is greater than most at this price point, and even some more expensive cameras.  Seems to have a lot of neat features, like the Smart Zoom (digital zoom without pixelation), multiple auto focus points, and ability to shoot 640x480 video.  The face detection is pretty cool and seems to work really well.  I thought about getting the DSC-W130 with its 8MP resolution and editing features, but figured that 8MP was more than I needed and I'd rather do my photo editing on the computer.One or two \"bugs\" I'm aware of:1. If you shoot using burst mode, you'll find that you can't turn the flash back on in any mode but Easy mode.  You have to reset the camera back to factory defaults to shoot using the flash again.  Even knowing this I would still buy the camera, but I'm hoping that enough people would alert Sony to this error to release a firmware update to fix it.  Otherwise I would have given it five stars.2. When you plug in the camera with the USB cable and turn it on the lens will open and then close, so be sure not to leave it face down before transferring data.3. This camera (unlike some) does not receive power through the USB cable so it needs to have a battery with charge in order to transfer pictures.  Don't leave it on too long while it's plugged in or it'll drain the battery.", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Deanoism", "ReviewID": "R2Y0KIGRGLCHK6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's just about perfect, for me. Of course, I'd like the quality and control of an SLR in a tiny package, but for something this portable it does a fine job. The onscreen descriptions of the settings are just fantastic, the ISO (low light) mode has to be seen to be believed...very little noise, even without flash. Pictures are mostly sharp, though without flash you still have to maintain a steady hand, as with any camera. Very balanced and realistic color. It's a very intuitive camera that lets you concentrate on your composition and not worry too much about exposure, which I think is what a small point and shoot should give you. I also love the 16x9 modes for stills, haven't done any video with it. I'd recommend getting a clear shield to stick on the screen, like I did...seems very scratchable otherwise. If I lost it I'd probably get the same camera again. I'm pretty conservative with my reviews, I'm sure many people would give this an unabashed 5 stars, and I almost did, but you still get the occasional surprise when you shoot something that should have turned out fine but didn't for some reason....I think it's just where the tech is at right now, but this camera rocks, no doubt.", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "B.

The camera was all around a good camera, but the pictures weren't as clear as I wanted them and it was a little bulky. Then I lost the battery and really wasn't sure if i wanted to spend the money to purchase a new one.Then last week, I went onto Amazon and looked at camera's and got interested in buying a new Camera. Since I wanted something light, small, preferably black, takes clear pictures, and good reviews, I came across this Sony Cybershot. After reading all the review (which im a first review, then buy person) I was Sold. The next day I went to Circuit City and purchased the Camera, a case, screen protector, and of the course the $30 dollar memory card.I took it home, turned it on and just started snapping pictures. The pictures were clear as day, even in low lighting areas. I tried using the Face Smile setting, which was a little confusing in the beginning, but after playing around, was actually really cool.Another thing that I love is that when slidding the wheel, like when going to  auto, face smile, video, etc, tells you what each setting is.Example: When turing the wheel to Twilight is says \"shoot low light scene using tripod\". I think this is an awesome setting when turning the wheel and not really know what your turning to and have to either play around or resorting to the manual.Overall I think this is an awesome camera thats light, a pocket size, and shoots crisp clear pictures. For the 200 dollars I spent, I cannot be happier.", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "awesome purchase", "Author": "B.

It had to be easy to operate, we don't have time to be messing with menus and adjustments.  I have an old Fuji 2600, an 8-year old 2MP camera, that has done a good job, but lately has been showing its age.I read a few professional reviews that said the DSC-W120 had better-than-average shutter lag for a pocket camera.  With that, and a good price, we bought the Sony, and we've used it for about 10 months.When operating indoors using the flash, the camera is way slow, even with the red-eye OFF, the flash set to always ON, and the camera pre-focused (shutter button pressed halfway).  There is still a long delay before the image is captured.  By that time the subject has moved or the expression is gone.I've read other reviews where they use the burst mode to overcome this problem, but that doesn't work for flash photography.The W120 has better low-light performance than my Fuji, but only because of the ability to push the ISO setting and the AF-assist light. But the Sony is no better for indoor pictures, unless the subject is still.The Sony has many more bells and whistles, some of which work. The face recognition works.  The smile detection works only occasionally.Outdoors, the camera performs pretty well, as expected with a 7.2MP imaging chip. But I was still disappointed with the speed, as it was little or no improvement over my old camera.In summary:Pros:-Inexpensive-Lots of controls for those who need them-Good for still portraits-Battery life, good for more than 100 shots with about 50% using flashCons:-Very slow shutter lag when used with flashOverall, this camera has been disappointing.

Needless to say, we were very disappointed with this camera and returned it.  We have since purchased a Panasonic FS3.

It doesn't have the 4X optical zoom like the Sony, but we'll gladly give up a bit of zoom for added quality.  The increased MP, 8.1 vs 7.2, makes up for a bit of the zoom.  And considering the premium we had to pay for a Memory Stick vs a simple SD card, the overall cost was the same.We have always been a Sony family for video recorders and cameras, TVs, portable stereos and game systems, but have never liked their digital cameras since the days of the Mavica and the early Cybershots.  We were just hoping they had figured out what they were doing wrong, but when it comes to digital cameras, it is obvious Sony is counting on their brand name and styling to win over customers and hope they will be satisfied with what they get in the way of image quality.We can only suggest you go to a store where you can get your hands on demo units that are charged and take some test pictures.

Delivery was timely. When the box was opened, it looked like it had been opened before, although everything was there.  A short while after, I noticed a stuck pixel on the display.  I guess that was why it was discounted.If conditions are right, the pictures are excellent. By right, I mean the subject must be holding still and the lighting must be good.Shutter lag is a problem, especially trying to get shots of grandkids.  Reviews I had read said that this camera was faster than average for point-and-shoot cameras, but I've got much older digicams that are at least as fast.  The flash is also slow, kids tend to move before it finally makes the shot.I can't say much good about the smile feature - good luck getting someone to smile hard enough to trigger it, then hold still long enough for the image to be captured.Low light performance is okay.  The image stabilization helps, although not as much as I expected.Focusing - there are multiple focus zones, and the camera may focus on the background instead of on the intended subject.  Pre-focusing works, but with moving subjects there isn't always time to do that.Finally, the battery discharges faster than expected.  If we shoot a lot of photos all at once it seems to hold up okay.  But if we can take a few shots on a fully charged battery, then let the camera sit for several days, turn it on again and the battery is half gone.

I didn't want to spend too much money on the camera. I didn't want a SLR, that was too much for me both in terms of money, involvement and care. I just wanted to snap shots and I could get good pictures that is pretty much all I needed.Of course, I started with Consumer reports. I didn't want the tiniest ones; these introduce quite a bit of shake during the shots. The compact ones listed the DSC-W170 as a best buy. The W300 was what I ideally wanted, but about $300 wasn't what I wanted to spend. At SLC, I hopped around Walmarts, Bestbuys, Targets but couldn't find any of the DSC-Ws. These take wide angle shots, good for landscape pictures. I guess this model range is going out and will probably be replaced by a newer range. Hence, it was a tough search.Finally, an Office Depot had the W120 and W150. I settled for the W120. The camera itself is about 3.5\" x 2.25\", which makes it easier to drop it into the shirt pocket. It has a built in flash and a view finder. Now a view finder is very important as in bright light, the LCD panel gets washed out and you can't see well what you want to snap. It also has a 4x Optical zoom. Consumer reports says you should have at least 3x Optical zoom. And it produces 7.2 Megapixels photos. Yes, it is not 15 MP, but 7.2 is good enough for 10x8 prints; by the way I never print photos now-a-days. We only view it on the screen. It also has a smile shutter, that I haven't tried. There are other loads of features - you can connect the camera to a HD TV and the camera somehow manages to show a great picture on the big screen. Consumer Reports said that worked well; I haven't tried that. See, I just need a functional good camera to snap the moment and get decent pictures. You have many modes preset such as portrait, twilight (this is neat), soft focus (only subject is sharp, rest is blurred), self timer, 2 (or more) second delay so that it eliminates the shake introduced by pressing the button.The battery is meant for the camera i.e., you can't use AA/AAA batteries. The small size of the battery makes the whole camera small. The charger is neat, you can plug the charger right into the outlet without long wires hanging. After the charging, you can snap the charger's prongs? back into the casing, making it easier to carry along on a trip. The Optical stabilization (Super Steady Shot, as Sony calls it) should be good, as I haven't noticed any shake in the pictures I took, given the size of the camera.You can view back the pictures as a slide show on the LCD panel and also play some music, if that is what you want. So far I have taken over 200 pictures and am quite happy with the camera. I read that there are some software bugs that prop up (some macro error), but haven't seen that yet. Hopefully, I don't ever.You can connect the camera to your computer's USB drive and transfer pictures directly without any special software, thought the camera comes with Sony's own picture organizer and viewer. The camera requires the Memory Pro stick card, which is slightly more expensive than your typical SD cards. If you connect to the computer with the secondary memory on, you won't see the built-in memory card. You have to remove the memory stick pro to access the internal memory.On the rush to go to the mountains, I had to pick up a 2 GB MSP for about twenty two bucks, but if you plan ahead you can find a 4GB for a little less on the Internet. The built in memory is good enough for about 15 pictures at lower resolution. The menu is extensive and hence not exactly simple; given the vast amount of features, it is hard to make it a simpler one, I guess.Overall for about $130 I paid for the camera ($22 for the additional memory), I am very satisfied with it.

The main reason I had held out on getting it was the fact that it uses Sony's proprietary Memory Stick instead of the ubiquitous SD card, which would allow for the easy transfer of data to most devices. I finally caved when the price of both the Cybershot and Memory Stick dropped.[Update: There's actually a microSD to Memory Stick Pro Duo Adapter now that converts a microSD card to a Memory Stick Pro Duo. (Transcend and PhotoFast both make it.) I got one (supposedly made by Kingston) from eBay that works flawlessly with a Kingston microSD card, which comes pre-formatted. Now, I'm able to use the microSD card on the Sony Cybershot using the \"microSD card to a Memory Stick Pro Duo adapter\" *AND* on all the devices that take microSD cards -- with no compatibility problems! I'm so glad Sony FINALLY opened up their proprietary Memory Stick format. I'm pumped!]The 7.2 megapixel resolution is plenty for making sharp 8 x 10 prints. I am just utterly amazed at how much detail this camera captures. The pictures are amazingly sharp and the colors look true. The huge 2.5-inch TFT LCD display is a definite plus and make accurately framing your pictures a cinch. The screen is bright, so the on-screen menu and images can be easily seen even in bright sunlight.The camera also does audio/videos at a high 30 fps frame rate. The resolution on videos is a measly 640 x 480, so when the videos are played in full screen on your monitor, they look slightly grainy. Still, the quality is decent enough and it's a nice little extra to have since this is not a dedicated camcorder.The placement of the buttons on the camera and the on-screen menu navigation is very user-friendly and intuitive.I can't give this Sony Cybershot enough praise. There's yet so many more features and functions to explore. This \"toy\" has given me hours of fun snapping random pictures and marveling at the captured images. The only regret I have is having waited so long before I took the plunge. If you're sitting on the fence, you should go ahead and get this!

I would have kept it together with the shoot button instead of moving it to the back with the rest of the controls.

And let us zoom in and out while we shoot videos - it's probably not very hard to do...July 2009.  We have used the camera for a while now, it still works well.  One thing that we found out is that in Auto setting it gets confused when you have a dark and well lighted spots on the same shot - like shooting a face with side light on it.  Then the lighted side gets overexposed and basically white.  Not too good.  I found out that this is common for Sony cameras, even for the expensive once.

It captures smiles the moment they happen - without having to press shutter. The mode can be set to capture when your subject laughs, smiles or even grins. It also has Face Detection function is able to differentiate children and adults to set priority.With this camera I actually take better pictures in poor lighing. It takes fabulous pictures in normal lighting. There has been several occasions that I have used my camera and my pictures have been requested the most...I am also very pleased that the screen in the rear of the camera is huge and clear as a bell. In poor lighting you can't see very well but that is expected. Once you take enough pictures you will be able to capture whatever your heart desires.7.2-megapixel gives you more detail and definition whenever you need big prints or for tight cropping. The advanced Sony Super HAD (Hole Accumulated Diode) CCD design allows more light to pass to each pixel, increasing sensitivity and reducing noise. So Bad lighting situations are ideal for this camera.Carl Zeiss 4x Optical Zoom Lens is great for sharp, detailed long shots and quickly frame images for better composition -- great for family sports, outdoor fun, and travel photos.I love this camera and for about $179 this is a perfect gift...for more reviews NewLifeFromWisdom . com", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love this", "Author": "Melisa L.

Quality of pictures is something else.  They're okay but nothing spectacular.  Blown up in Photoshop, I am sadly disappointed.  My Sony camera that I purchased 2 cameras before this one took much better pictures.

I thought maybe my expectations were a little unrealistic because I was accustomed to my SLR.  But---I have compared the W120 to the F717 and there is just no comparison.  Hands down, the 5+ year old F717 beats the W120 at any shooting situation.My last gripe about the W120 is the download cable.  What is this?  Why can't it use some type of a standard cable?  I finally gave my W120 to my daughter who comes home only about every 2 weeks.  She likes to download her pics to our computer but the last time, she forgot her cable.  I have almost every download cable that's available but not that \"special\" one.  Wait---oh, yeah, I'll use a card reader.  Oh, wait---I can't find the adaptor for the pro duo card.  Now that's a dilemma.  Come on, Sony, make downloading a little easier.  Simplicity would have been nice here.I give it 3 stars because it is handy and has some great features on it, but I think picture quality and the download situation could be better.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great product!!!", "Author": "baucha \"baucha\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZA1EN7HVR9HV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is simply a great point and shoot camera.

I was looking for something much more portable with an updated mega pixel capability. This camera is perfectly sized and easy to use, but unfortunately takes undependable pictures.  Some photos are in focus and others blurry for no apparent reason. This happens with pictures taken right in row of the same subject with the same settings. Indoor, outdoor, sunlight, lamplight all hit and miss. Tried a multitude of different settings with no improvement. The most frustrating part is that the pictures usually look fine on the viewing screen, so it's not until they're downloaded that you realize the shot is blurry. I missed numerous once-in-a-lifetime photos on a trip this summer because they looked fine when reviewed on screen but blurry when downloaded. Admittedly, the shots that do turn out have good color...It's possible that I'm just not \"getting\" this camera. Maybe I'm not doing something right(and yes, I know to partially press the shutter button to focus before taking the shot); however, I haven't had this problem with our earlier cameras, my sister's camera, the camera at work, etc.  After months of experimenting I decided \"it's not me, it's you,\" and I moved on to a new relationship with a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 that I am completely in love with.Pros:-portable size-easy to navigate-good photo colors-sturdy (Our pony BIT the camera.  The camera was in its case, but I had to pull it free from her teeth and there were grinding noises involved.

Instantly I was thrilled!  I soon came to discover that NOTHING from my former Kodak digital camera was compatible with my new camera.  I broke down and purchased a second battery and a memory card.  The battery that came with the camera was rechargeable and seemed to have great life!  The camera uses a \"stick\" style memory card, not an SD.  Because of this, I needed to make certain not to lose track of the cord that comes with the camera allowing you to load pictures into your computer, purchase a special memory card converter or take to a place that will put pictures from \"stick\" onto CD.The camera has a weak zoom motor.  Any small drop or jar can cause the gears inside to become stuck or 'derailed.'  This IS covered by Sony Warranty (only three months for most models).  Getting this issue repaired involves spending at least 30 minutes on the phone struggling with Sony Tech Support.  Once an agreement (either that the issue IS or IS NOT covered by warranty or payment is worked out) is agreed upon you must send your camera in.  This process took over 3 weeks each time.  The lack of camera during this time proved to be a MAJOR inconvenience for me.The camera has a nice display screen on the back of the camera.  Pictures show up nice and clear!  However, this screen is VERY easily scratched!  Enough scratches on this screen and viewing pictures or navigating through the menu become difficult.On a different note, the features are easy to use!  I am not fond of the ISO setting.  Pictures taken with that setting are VERY grainy!  With all the other settings the pictures are VERY nice for the price of the camera!I would NOT get this camera again, and do NOT recommend this camera to ANYONE who is planning on using this camera other than for a paper weight!", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Joshmax", "ReviewID": "R2X6GCCGF9Y2HW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Takes excellent pics, easy to carry around.One complain, you can't use any card or charger except Sony's.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Constant problem with the lens barrel assembly", "Author": "Charles E.

It does have one feature that the Kodak doesn't have and it has the ability to turn off autofocus.

It also doesnt feel cheap(plasticey) and feels very sturdy. The buttons are easy to get to and the screen is clear and bright. Battery life is also very good. The battery does take a long time to charge but it really is more of an overnight charger.The pictures on this camera for the most part come out great. Pictures outside and in good light should give you very clear pictures. The macro feature also works with well with close up shots. Picures in the dark come out good as well although some in very low light do come out a little grainy and some have a little color bleeding if thats the right word for it, nothing too major just not something that youd want to blow up really big. There is extensive adjustments you can make to help this. Also you can take a shot with flash and one without to see what comes out better. Video on this camera in the highest setting comes out suprisingly good. The flash on this camera is also conveinent and it taked 2 seconds recharge the flash. You can also adjust the brightness of the flash which i though was amazing. Amazon shipping was fast and the package arrived with no damage at all.

When in the \"Twilight\" mode, which literally allows you to make great shots with a flash in a pitch black room or area, you MUST use a tripod.  On this setting, the camera becomes extremely sensitive to movement from your hand.  Even the pulse from your finger.  If there is a light source within the view, it will streak oddly, leaving you wondering \"How did that happen?  It's cool, but how?\"  Using a tripod keeps this problem from happening.  I took a picture of the corner of my bedroom the other night (in total darkness), after I got the camera, and the LED numbers from my clock streaked up in a line toward the ceiling.

The feature that takes a picture once you smile is creative and useful.  The camera comes with features that let you shoot in black and white, sepia, and vivid colors which i love. I only have three tiny factors that i would change about the camera. Keep in mind that I am a 16 year old girl who is not incredibly smart when it comes to electronics, so there may be some way to fix my problems i have just not figured it out yet.  One problem is that it does not let you zoom in or out while you are recording a video.  Another problem is that it does not let you delete a picture in the camera mode as soon as you take it.  Instead, you have to go to the mode that shows the pictures.  The other problem i have with it is that when you are going through your taken pictures, at first they are blurry.  After a split second they sharpen to their normal form (I'm pretty sure this is true for all cameras though).", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony cybershot W120", "Author": "nich", "ReviewID": "RZ2T85WQYGXXP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a Sony Cybershot s650 and it was the worst, I had it for five days and used it for two before the screen stop working sony needs to take that model off the market so i decided to get another, after looking around there was no other brand that i like, so i got a Sony Cybershot w120 and i must say that it is much better.everything is good with this oneI really like it!!", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Carolina Felix", "ReviewID": "R18TBNOP4IUZLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent digital camera.

I can't believe this camera has earned 136 5-Star reviews and 49 4-Star reviews. Also, I can't believe they are charging $250 for this piece of junk. I've had my camera for about 2 years.  I bought it to replace a Kodak Easy Share, which took awesome pics but had a serious battery problem.  This Sony takes great pics outdoors with lots of natural light.  Indoors is an entirely different story.  Lag time is excessive.  Blur is a common problem and many precious moments are lost due to this.  Many pics come out yellow AND blurry.  This is supposed to be a point-and-shoot camera.  There may be settings you can tweak to alleviate these issues, but if I wanted a manual camera, I would have bought one!  The battery life is way too short, therefore I had to purchase an additional battery for a back-up, so I would always have one fully charged and ready to go.  I don't like the memory stick... I prefer an SD card.  Like I said, I've had this camera for about 2 years and stopped taking pics for awhile because they were so crappy.  FINALLY, I broke down and bought a Nikon Coolpix S3000 12.0MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom Electronic Vibration Reduction (VR) and 2.7-Inch LCD for $110 and LOVE it.

It takes much better pictures than a digital camera only two years older.  It's quick on startup and very quick on trigger-to-shot speed.The entire camera is made much more intuitive by the visual explanations that appear on the display with each selection.  This helps translate those little-used symbols into something you can actually learn and put to good use (like the low light setting, or smile mode that may otherwise get overlooked for the life of the camera).The pictures taken with a flash are much improved over previous Sonys.  Whether its software, sensor or flash, I don't know.  But flash pictures are far more natural looking than previous models.  They're not over or under-saturated.In fact, this model is so intuitive and inexpensive, I sent one to a less-technical family member to replace an otherwise great Sony digital camera I recommended for them just 2 years earlier.  I even got one for my wife and now use it more than my own because of its features, slimness and quick shutter speed.Minor niggles: the otherwise simple and slim camera-to-USB cable has been replaced by a 'universal' cable that also includes video and audio plugs which makes the cable 3x thicker and more cumbersome than earlier models. Also - the rotating setting dial isn't indented far enough into the camera, so its easy to rub with your right hand when taking pictures which can bump the camera into another mode.Be sure to get a good memory stick like the Sony 2 GB Memory Stick PRO Duo (MSX-M2GS) (Retail Package) or the larger Sony 4 GB Memory Stick PRO DUO ( MSX-M4GS ) (Retail Package) both of which come with an adapter for card readers like the IOGear GFR281 56-in-1 Card Reader/Writer which is faster for transferring photos than a direct connection to the camera.I also opted for the Sony NP-FG1 InfoLITHIUM Type G Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery Pack for Sony W & H Series Digital Cameras battery that provides a 'time left' display in the camera - something the standard Sony NP-BG1 battery that comes with the camera does not.Least expensive highest quality camera I've seen for under $500.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "I've searched for 8 months the search is finally over!!", "Author": "Stephany Nicole Stokes \"Stephany N Stokes\"", "ReviewID": "RDG5E6YZHR0ZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for \"The\" perfect camera for about 8 months if not longer!

I was surprised with the bad quality of the images of sony DSCW 120 when you view them on the computer.  My old Fuji camera (I think 7 years old) makes much better images.  Then only good images from Sony are those when you have plenty of light and sun and in this case any camera gives you very good image.
