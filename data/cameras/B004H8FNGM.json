Most consumer digital cameras can't zoom while in video mode.6) Surprisingly good wide-angle (you don't need a wide-angle adapter)7) The panorama mode is cute and effective but not very high quality (noise is introduced due to panorama cropping).8) Excellent flash coverage.9) Choice of MPEG or AVCHD recording. MPEG is the best choice for compatibility and editing but it takes more space in your memory card. AVCHD is a pain to edit compared to MPEG.Cons:1) Compared to my old Canon HV20 the TX10 is simply unable to stabilize the image. Not a deal breaker but you may want to bring a tripod with you at all times.2) Battery life is dismal, I cannot get more than 80 minutes of continued video shooting from a fully charged Sony battery. I understand third party batteries fair worse (if they work at all). This is a particularly poignant issue if you are near water since you cannot open the camera to change the battery then.3) The TX10 can charge the battery \"in-camera\", it does not come with the standard battery charger, instead Sony has included a USB cable and a USB adapter. This is a terrible problem for travel photographers since the battery life is short but it takes several hours to recharge the a battery inside the camera, obviously, while it is charging, you are unable to take photos or videos. This also means you cannot charge your \"spare battery\" at the same time. In order to solve the problem, you would have to buy extra batteries and an external battery charger, so now you have to carry two chargers. This could have been easily avoided if Sony had included their regular battery charger as they do with older models.4) All the 3D shooting modes are useless gimmicks, ignore them. They just take precious space in your memory card and you can't view 3D without special equipment.5) A Mini HDMI to HDMI cable was not included, it could  cost you up to $30 to buy a Sony cable. Just get a cheap one for a couple of bucks, don't buy the Sony one, HDMI cables are all compatible.6) The interactive touch sensitive menu can only be described as a  complex labyrinth, extremely awkward to navigate. If Sony was aiming for a friendly interface, they failed miserably.7) The LCD touch screen is hyper-sensitive and the tiny icons are way to close to each other, the end result it that you rarely press the icon you were aiming for, by the time you solve the mess you created accidentally, your subject has fled the scene. You can help this by \"hiding\" the icons but then, well, that also requires extra time. Results in an above average learning curve.8) This camera is extremely slow sometimes, mostly because the 1080p video and the larger 16.2MP pictures require more processing time. Not an ideal camera for action photos.9) If you like manual exposure controls, forget it, this camera will make you crazy mad. It is automated, albeit it has a nice white balance mode. On the other hand, the auto presets do a better job than a human would in many cases.10) In video mode, the color saturation is lacking and the video is overexposed 1/2 stop, this creates a somewhat washed out bluish appearance. I suspect they rushed this camera to the market and it just needs a firmware update to fix this. On the other hand, the still photo color balance and exposure is much more pleasant. Sadly the camera \"forgets\" your manual exposure adjustments when you turn it off.11) The digital zoom is surprisingly the worse of its kind, quite useless, but I never use it anyway.12) Attention Divers: The Sony \"Marine Pack\" enclosure is incompatible with the DSC-TX10.13) For amateur divers: TX10 is NOT truly waterproof no matter what Sony may want you to believe. The camera is only \"water-resistant\" at best. It is possible to open the battery latch underwater by accident (there is no secondary locking mechanism like Panasonic's) and the seals are not strong enough anyway. Remember, all it takes is one tiny drop of water to fog your camera lens from the inside.I have yet to see an \"waterproof\" consumer camera that can last more than a few hours underwater without a case. The internet is full of horror stories regarding this issue. There is no need to gamble with your investment. However, I highly recommend the TX10 for use in the rain or the snow. Maybe even kayaking.Overall, I like this camera, it takes superb photos, not as good as a Nikon SRL  but the color balance is pretty decent for the price but if you don't need a water \"resistant\" camera then get the recently released Sony HX7V, it takes better pictures and it is less expensive.By the way: I returned the TX10. The issues mentioned above became too much of a nuisance.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy This Camera - It Is Not Waterproof-Sony Warranty Terrible", "Author": "mike", "ReviewID": "R1ND8H9MNGLOQC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is not waterproof!

Hayes", "ReviewID": "R21DRM26TG1EGW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I own the TX9 which has been stellar thus far (with the exception of the flash failing and needing replacement from Sony) with excellent video quality and very good photo quality.  My review of the TX10 is based on my experience with the TX9.Rather than getting deep into a wordy review of this camera I will give good/bad qualities:Good: - Water proofing to 15 feet is a really handy feature.  This camera handled pool water like a champ with no issues of water infiltration anywhere.- Sharp video with beautiful color saturation.  Compared to the TX9, the TX10 has slightly better video quality.- Quick functioning zoom, especially during video recording and compared to the TX9.- Menu layout is a bit more intuitive compared to the TX9.- Camera body is smaller compared to TX9.- Fish-eye effect seems to be less compared to the TX9 at wide angles. (but it's still there)- Steady shot seems more aggressive compared to TX9 which makes video more enjoyable to watch.- Ability to snap photos while taking video.- Slightly improved low light performance especially in video.Bad:- Audio seems muffled compared to TX9.  I believe this is due to the water proof material that encapsulates the microphones, but there is a noticeable degradation compared to the TX9.- Terribly slow start-up, especially taking video.  Time from turning the camera on to taking a photo is, on average, 6 seconds.  Time from turning the camera on to taking video can take as long as 9 seconds.- Superior auto mode and intelligent auto mode has lackluster performance compared to the TX9.- Zoomed video is less sharp compared to the TX9.- Because of the smaller form factor, I find myself catching my fingers in photos and video more often compared to the TX9.- On the TX9, you can be in photo mode and have the option to immediately take video at the push of a button on the touch screen. On the TX10, there is a video record button on the top of the camera, but when you push it in, it takes about 5 1/2 seconds before video recording starts.  On the TX9, it is immediate.- Don't notice a real difference in picture quality with the 16.2 Megapixels.- Eats batteries compared to the TX9.  Not sure why, but I only got 25 minutes of video from a full battery where I get 40 minutes on the TX9.- Does not come with a plug in charger like the TX9, but rather a USB cable that plugs into the phone to charge the battery.- Smaller LCD compared to the TX9, with what I perceive to be lower resolution quality which makes it somewhat difficult to determine if a photo is properly focused.- Auto focus is not as quick during video compared to the TX9, sometimes resulting in fuzzy video especially in low light.- Menu uses swipe technology similar to iphone and Ipod touch.  However, it is not nearly as responsive and often results in selecting items you did not mean to select.Overall, I like the camera, but I think that unless you will use the waterproof ability on a regular basis I think the TX9 is a better buy.  They are very close in image quality with the TX10 slightly edging out the TX9 in video quality.  The smaller form factor may be an issue for those with larger hands.  My original intention was to keep this camera and sell the TX9 on ebay, but I actually think I'll return the TX10 and wait for the next generation.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT WATERPROOF", "Author": "Spaluny", "ReviewID": "R26G6USSLWYC1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is NOT waterproof as advertised and the Sony warranty is not covering water damage...which might tell something about their trust in their own product.I bought this camera especially before a trip to HI. My wife wanted to have a small camera since she dislikes my bulky DSLR and lenses. Since we also planned to do some snorkeling, the TX10 sounded too good to be true.I don't feel comfortable taking electronic equipment into the water and therefore I followed carefully all the instructions for underwater operation.I made some pictures in the hotel fish pool and it seemed to work fine. However, after our first snorkeling trip (we are not expert snorkelers and just stayed on the surface for not more than 30min) the camera showed some corrosion in the battery and USB compartment, followed by complete failure the next day!Since the warranty does not cover water-damage and in any case Sony tells you that you are too dump and did not closed the battery compartment before jumping into the water (!?), this camera is now a piece of expensive trash.I am highly disappointed by this product and Sony's policy. The customer is paying quite a lot of money extra for the waterproof capability and expects the camera to be waterproof. Otherwise, what would be the point?At least I would have expected that Sony has the honesty to stand behind their product and a vision based on customer satisfaction.After this experience, I am done with Sony.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor Design", "Author": "J.

I never opened the doors while the camera was exposed to water and always dried it off and checked for sand in the seals.  I never took it deeper than six feet.  I was in Hawaii last month and the camera quit.  When I returned home I mailed the camera to the sony service center and was finally informed that there was corrosion in the camera and that had voided the warranty.

Just like the TX5 with more features and equal quality.For all the negative reviews regarding water getting in; I have not had this issue. BUT as with any waterproof camera from any manufacture, there are bound to be customers who get water in the cameras and blame the design.Read the directions, take care of your stuff, and don't go deeper then recommended. Keep the seals clean and lubricated with grease that can be purchased from Sony.Also, the camera does have a water proof case, which has been out for a while, and is conveniently sold here on AMAZON.com (Sony MPK-THK). Please check out my review for the MPK-THK Marine Pack for the TX10. If you are planning on keeping the camera under water use the housing, its good down to 130+ feet.The camera records in 1080i, so for the people who purchased the camera expecting 1080p please read the specifications carefully.If your camera is slow try using a better SD card I use the SANDISK Extreme SDHC 8GB Class 10. For the people who lost pictures from water getting in, the SANDISK Extreme cards are waterproof, shock proof, x-ray proof, and freeze proof. If you would have used it then only the camera would be lost.Do your research, reviews are personal opinions. Pros and Cons are different for everyone but should always be taken in to account to see if it applies to you.

After looking at several other brands this was head and shoulders above the rest. It not only takes fantastic pictures but the photos I took underwater in the Caribbean look like they should be on a postcard ( and I am not a photographer by any means!!). The camera transitioned without hesitation from the water to the beach to dinner. There were no issues with the salt water or sand and I have to say the shutter speed was lightening fast underwater and above.

I have persuaded many friends and family to purchase Sony products over the years due to their high quality, name brand, and good customer service. However, after this incident I can honestly say I will never purchase a Sony Product again.I pre-ordered one of the first TX-10 Cameras in March of 2011. My wife and I used this camera for a few days in April, and then again in November. While we were using it in November I went to put the camera in my pocket, and a piece of the frame came off on the side of my pocket. I thought this to be out of the ordinary because this camera is advertised as being shock proof, water proof and drop proof, and as you can see in the pictures below, the camera has no impact dents from being dropped at all.I was concerned that having the chipped piece of frame would compromise the camera's water tight integrity, so on November 25th I opened up a repair case, work order number 300754213, and mailed the camera to Sony.According to Sony's records, the camera was received on December 3rd. However I didn't receive a call from Sony until December 16th 2011. Anna, a Sony representative said the camera was being repaired and would be shipped back to me within a few days. On December 18th 2011, another Sony representative called, this time saying the camera wasn't going to be repaired, due to the fact that the damage was user inflicted, and also due to the fact the repair would cost over $700! How could the repair cost more than the actual unit brand new? I paid $399 for this camera new! I explained to the Sony representative that this damage was not user inflicted, and should be covered under Sony's warranty. The representative continued to deny that the repair would be covered, and REFUSED to let me speak to his manager, or give me his name. The camera was shipped back to me on 12/19/2011, unrepaired. How can I be told on one day that it will be repaired only to get a call 2 days later telling me it will not be repaired. If the case had been assessed and confirmed as being covered under warranty then it is simply not acceptable to go back on that decision.I called customer service the next day to explain the situation, as I was not happy with the mixed messages and contradicting answers from the 2 people I had spoken to. They referred me to National Customer Service. I phoned National Customer Service and reached the representative Brian. After patiently pleading my case for over 45 minutes, Brian refused the repair, refused to give me his employee number or manager's name or number, and then HUNG UP ON ME!This is THE WORST customer service experience I have ever had.

Well, the best camera is the one you have with you, and this is the perfect pocket camera. It is smaller than my phone and slides in and out of my pockets easily. I bought this to replace a Panasonic DMC-FX3 which I have had for years, until the day it had been dropped it's last time. So, I went shopping and weighed all the pros and cons. This camera surpasses my expectations. The pictures are amazing, as well as the features. Did I buy this to take with me abalone diving? No. Did I buy it to take up El Capitan ? No. Did I buy it so I could pull it out at a party, take to the pool, beach, rive, lake, have it when I never thought I would need it? Yes, yes and yes. Did I buy it so when my kids drop it off the table or out the car door, I still have a functioning camera? Yes again.  Sure the battery my not be the strongest, so what get the Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Sony NP-BN1 (...) and your all set. Since the batteries are so small you can carry an extra one anywhere. As far as waterproof, well this nor any other in it's class should be your choice for a lot of diving or water use. Get a Canon G12 and waterproof housing. See how easy this can be. The video button might take getting use to. It takes 4-5 second wait, to shift from camera to video. Let's all just slow down a minute and get real. This is a camera and it takes great pictures. The fact that I can capture video too is a bonus. If you are really going to shoot any good video get a good video camera. Hey, how about this. If you think you are about to take a video, press the button 5 seconds before and edit out the stuff you don't want. Lastly is the lens placement. My Panasonic had the lens in the left center and now this has it in the upper left side. Again, this is something that take time to get use to. I have big hands and have a habit of bring my left fingers around in front of the lens. It really only took a few shots to realize my grip was bad and to adjust. The more I use this camera the more I love it. I have never felt so comfortable carrying a camera. Even though, my old Panasonic was small it was thick, almost twice as thick as this Sony.

Tannen\"", "ReviewID": "RVG4CHQ9Y6J5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX10 camera from Amazon in early May, 2011 and have used it very extensively for four weeks. I'm a 59-year-old MIT-educated physicist living with my wife and 6-year-old child in New York City. As a physicist, I've developed solid state CCD image sensors for aerospace applications, and over the years I've purchased cameras (large and small) from a variety of manufacturers, including Nikon, Leica, Canon, Sony & Panasonic. Recently, when a new physics experiment required that I buy a rugged dual-purpose camera for capturing HDR (high dynamic range) photographs and HD video, some professional colleagues at the MIT Media Lab recommended the new Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX10 because of its small, rugged waterproof design and the superb low-light performance of it's large, high-resolution 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS sensor. It seemed a good value at $320 since I needed a small, reliable, high-quality dual-purpose camera that was able to shoot hi-res HDR photographs and HD video under extreme conditions (snow, cold water, hot desert sand, mountain climbing).Sure enough, after four weeks of rugged, continuous professional use, the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX10 camera really \"took a licking but kept on ticking!\" As a camera sensor aerospace developer, I was at first skeptical to trust the camera's \"advanced intelligent\" automatic exposure settings, but in dangerous conditions I had to depend on the camera to make clear exposure decisions quickly. Indeed, the little camera's ultimate high-speed performance was very impressive, yielding superb image sharpness and accurate depth-of-field, even in very low light. The camera's intelligent automatic 3D Sweep Panorama photographs were impressive, too. I printed hundreds of the camera's HDR photographs (in both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect-ratios) on large-format Epson printers easily, and the prints were wonderful, sharp and color-accurate. I also shot many hours of 16:9 aspect-ratio video in 720p HD resolution and in full HD 1080/60i resolution. The video is impressive--- clear, sharp and color-accurate, played via the camera's built-in HDMI connector to a new 55\" wide-screen HDTV.I purchased the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX10 camera with a black anodized case which actually withstood many knocks and falls without scratches after 4 weeks. However, the camera's large LCD screen now has a very fine (almost imperceptible) scratch caused by some metal keys in my pocket!The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX10 camera uses intelligent power-saving controllers for efficiency, but its tiny rechargeable (lithium) Li-ion battery is very compact so battery capacity is quite limited, of course. During four weeks of very demanding use, Sony's tiny Li-ion battery longevity depended strictly upon camera performance load demand. A fully-charged battery lasted about ~ 20 minutes (worst case) if the camera captured continuous full HD 1080/60i video. A fully-charged battery lasted about ~ 40 minutes (average) if the camera captured continuous 720p HD video. A fully-charged battery lasted about ~ 60 minutes (best case) for random intermittent shooting of large, high-resolution 16.2 MP still photographs without the camera's built-in flash bulb. Of course, using the flash a lot can cut battery longevity in half.As a physicist, I appreciate that Sony's tiny Li-ion battery really is remarkable and that the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX10 camera is quite an engineering feat for Sony, but I recommend buying a spare battery (or two) with an external wall charger so you can charge extra batteries while the internal battery charges in the camera from it's USB AC adapter, which is included in the package. Sony's tiny battery charges very quickly!The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX10 camera creates HDR photos and HD videos as digital files stored on an internal Sony memory stick, sold separately. I purchased two separate 16 GB Sony memory sticks so I could fill up one and have a spare while I dumped data from the first, but Sony memory sticks are available in larger sizes, like 32 GB, too. Note that HDR photos and HD videos stored as digital files can be VERY large and difficult to manage or edit without a very fast new Mac or PC. Many users will find it easier to transfer these large digital files to a Sony Playstation PS3 which (@$299) can play large digital files easily on a large HDTV and manage or sort files by name, date or type, even grouping them in folders or printing photos on your printer.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "High Expectations Not Met.

On paper... this camera seemed like it was the PERFECT underwater/outdoor camera. I loved the fact that you could slip it in your pocket and take it anywhere due to its size and it looks right at home even in a fancy restaurant. I spent a week snorkeling, hiking, and adventuring in Kauai so that served as my first chance to do an in depth review for what this camera was made for: the outdoors... and I wasn't too impressed with real-world usage. The photos and videos were great for such a small point and shoot but the practicality was lacking on multiple fronts to make this the \"PERFECT\" outdoor camera. However, there are a lot of things I truly appreciate about this little camera. In classic Pro/Con style, here are my overall thoughts and feelings on the Sony TX10.Pros:-Small and compact. Sexy. Take it anywhere. Looks right at home on the beach or in a fancy restaurant.-Touch screen is \"cool\". I would love this screen on non-waterproof casual camera... BUT... its also a con, see below-Cool, useless features like smile detection (takes the picture automatically when you smile) and 3D... haven't used 3D. Like I said, Fun, but useless.-Slide cover to protect lens when closed... BUT again, also a con. See below-Screen display resolution is awesome-Takes 1080i videos at 60 frames per second vs 30 frames per second that most point and shoots utilize. This provides \"lifelike\" motion. I love it and it looks great on my 55\" TV-Great wide angle lens 25mm-Picture and Photo quality were great... however video seemed to struggle at times to focus correctly.-I really like the sweep panorama mode. Very cool pictures and they seem well done and rather seamless. You can take \"High Res\" panoramas that are up to 43 Megapixels! (UPDATE: This has become-The waterproofing seemed pretty solid. I never found any drops of water in the housing or fog in the lens.Cons:-Due to the fact that the video is 1080i (interlacing), videos tend to have lines when played back in media players such as VLC on Mac and PC.(UPDATE: It is the Media Player's fault - I stuck the SD card in my Panasonic Blu-Ray player that can play AVCHD off of SD Cards and the 1080 60i videos taken by the camera look amazing.)-This was a big one. The startup to photo time is so SLOW (5-7 seconds) and taking a video is 5 seconds on top of that. By time you press record to take movies it takes at least 5-7 seconds to start taking the movie. So annoying. This is incredibly slow compared to the Panasonic TS1s I owned. (UPDATE: Still annoying.)-This is speculation here but The small and sleek form factor seems like if I dropped it it would get scuffed up really bad or might break. Doesn't seem rugged at all. (UPDATE: The black model of this camera will show nicks pretty easily... seems like it only has a very thin back coatings on it.)-The screen was easily scratched by keys or other things in pocket (screen protector!)-The touch screen is accurate about 80% of the time. Its finicky and sometimes inaccurate. Some things need to be tapped 2-3 times to register. It cannot be used while underwater if you want to change settings. Huge CON. Tactile buttons are key if you are going to be using a camera underwater or in the snow with gloves on.-The shutter button is way too sensitive for me. if you accidentally even graze it it will take you out of viewing mode... The full shutter release is most camera's sensitivity for a half-press to focus.-I don't know if it was the unit I had or not but the white background noise in those videos is pretty bad. I tried it in multiple settings, completely dry and it was always there. You can't really tell on the playback on the camera itself but once played in any media player, it's overwhelming. If i get an exchange unit, I will update this to see whether or not it was a bad mic. (UPDATE: It was a bad mic. I got a new unit and the audio is fine on it)-The slide cover is kind of inconvenient to get down. The front is so smooth and the edges so thin, its sometimes a little clumsy to get it down, also, some dirt got caught between the slide and the front of the camera and it made some fine scratches when opening and closing the camera.)-I'm worried that sand or dirt are going to get lodged in the hinges of the slide cover and jam it or make it grind. I've heard its usually not a problem, but stil... (UPDATE: dirt and sand got in the hinges and you could hear it grind while it was in there. After I got back from my trip to Southern Utah a quick freshwater rinse in the sink seemed to bring it back to normal)-The slide cover holds water after the camera is dry...-Battery life is not very good at all and I don't like that you have to plug it in to charge it rather than having its separate charger. I like to have 2 batteries and charge one while I take the other to use. (UPDATE: I bought the SONY battery charger for this and the aftermarket generic battery from eForcity here on Amazon. The aftermarket battery actually has a better life than the Sony battery. Sony battery: 630mah, aftermarket: 900mah. I would recommend it)So there you have it. I love the form factor, but for a rugged outdoor camera I would prefer a more solid build like the Panasonic TS3. Great form factor for everyday around the town use. The biggest concerns I have that will probably lead to me returning the camera are the touch screen and non-rugged build. The videos and pictures are amazing so when it comes down to it, that is what matters most. If you want a waterproof camera to protect from a spill or just a fun day at the pool then this might be the one for you. If you are going to use this camera on the snow, on the beach, snorkeling, hiking, climbing etc... just be careful with it or I would probably look more into a more rugged camera like the Panasonic TS3 or Olympus TG Tough Series. They all take great pictures and videos in my opinion. Would I recommend this camera? Yes.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good but lots of room for improvement", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "R2O54OIRJ2KLY1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To start out, I have extensively used several other waterproof cameras including the Sony TX5 (1 year old), Sony TX5 current model and Panasonic TS10.  I have done side-by-side comparisons enlarged to pixel level and beyond.  My comments are from decades of photographic experience and exclusive use of digital cameras for the last 15 years.  I would like to clear the air that I am very happy with the camera in spite of its shortcomings.  This review goes into details of issues that Sony hopefully takes note and fixes, for some are easy fixes that are mostly software based.1st.  16mp is completely unnecessary.  The old TX5 is 10 mp and produces better sharper images.  The Panasonic 14mp produces much better sharper clearer images.  You can test this yourself by up-converting in photoshop the 10mp to 16mp and compare at 200 or 300%.  Where there is a distinct transition from one color to another, theoretically it should only be a couple pixels wide.  With these cameras, the transition is often 10 or more pixels wide.  I even compared my 5 year old Canon 7mp camera, and it's quality was better than the 16mp Sony.  Shame on Sony to enter the marketing hype game of using megapixels as a measure of comparison.  The pixel density is far too great for anything above 5mp with the tiny 3/8\" CMOS (and CCDs).  If they wanted better pictures, they would use the larger sensors.  Please don't treat the consumer as idiots.2nd.  The new capacitive touch screen is a major step down from the resistance one used on the TX5.  Far too sensitive sometimes and other times not at all.  In water, it turns itself off, so if you want a flash, you need to resurface, hold the camera above water and make the changes.3rd.  No manual mode.  Even worse, in auto modes, the camera tells you the f-stop and shutter speed, but not the ISO it selected.4th.  Background defocus seldom works and does not allow a for a center focus area where you can point at the subject, and push the button half way down to lock focus, then recompose the photo.  The camera only does background defocus on a single person at certain distances.  Such a great feature, done poorly at best.5th.  Why is the PLAY button on the lower right of the screen.  It should not even be on the touch screen at all, since there is a dedicated button on top of the camera.  Often you accidentally press it and get out of the shooting mode, missing your picture.6th.  Slow to start up (nearly 6 seconds) for first shot.  This is back to the year 2000 for startup speeds.Since I ragged so much, I thought a few positive things might be in order.1st.  Video quality is great.  Zoom while you video and exposure and focus constantly correcting.  AVCHD is a great format too.2nd.  16ft underwater!  I took the camera down to 10ft during several snorkel trips without a problem.  How many camera look good during a night on the town, slip into a pocket or work in the ocean.  Very impressed.3rd.  The digital signal processing for multi shot low light performance is great.  Pictures are not like they are in bright light, but they are useable for 4x6 prints or computer screen viewing.There are other comments, but these come to mind right now.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Could be great, but flaky shutter release ruins the camera", "Author": "Joshua M. Levine", "ReviewID": "R1RDJUWA81ISFW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love my DSC-TX9 and it has been my primary camera for the past 6 months. My absolute favorite feature is that I can pull the camera out of my pocket, slide down the lens cover, and snap a shot all in about a second. I've gotten addicted to this quick-shot ability that beats any camera I've ever had.I was very excited when the TX10 was announced since it looked like it had all the great features of a TX9 but with higher resolution, waterproof case, and built in HDR. I think I got the very first TX10 to come off the boat (serial #501000).I am disappointed. The camera seems to start up quickly when you slide down the lens cover but if you try to push the shutter release when it first comes up the camera can be flaky. Sometimes it takes the picture immediately, but sometimes it doesn't. Worse, when it is in \"flaky mode\" you can hold down the shutter forever and it never takes the shot- you have to actually release the shutter and then press it again (sometimes multiple times). I can't tall you how many pictures I've missed because of this annoying behavior. It is a deal breaker for me. This camera is going on ebay and I'm switching back to my TX9.UPDATE: After spending the weekend with a camera in each pocket - TX9 left and TX10 in right - and taking every picture twice, I do not see any clear winner in terms of picture quality. Unless you need a waterproof camera, I'd say the TX9 is a better choice becuase it takes pictures of equal quality but is cheaper and starts much more quickly.

Takes very nice above-water photos, and the panorama sweep (both above and below water) works great.  1080 movies are great both above and below water - although there is about a 3 sec delay before it starts recording.  No noticable video focus hunting even when zooming. Mine has no noticeable delay from start to taking photos - flip down the slider and take a shot, slide up to power down (as opposed to the power button).  I found the battery to be sufficient to take many shots and movies while snorkeling - I had a spare battery and never used it on a 2 week trip, although I did charge the battery up every night.  My older cameras (2-4 yrs old)are a panasonic TS1 which probably 90% of underwater photos were blurry, although took good 720 video; and an older Olympus camera.  The sony blows them both away.  I've noticed the sony underwater photos can be a little grainy but they are rarely blurry. I have a panasonic ts5 w/ underwater case that I think takes more detailed/clear underwater photos, but maybe 30% turn out blurry and the 720 video focus hunts horribly.

I fish and surf.....a lot!  After receiving my Sony I was impressed with the small size but was concerned on how it didn't seem a beefed up as my Olympus cameras were.  That being said I kept much better care of my Sony.  I rinsed and dried it after every use, I used screen protector, and was very careful.  There was zero corrosion on the housing after 7 months and the camera looked new still.  One night the camera was acting funny when putting it in the ocean about a foot down on a monopod.  The touchscreen stopped working so I put the camera away after pulling the battery and checking the hatches to ensure they were closed.......they were.  I did notice condensation inside the battery compartment but not very much.  I'll send it back to Sony!I received a call from Sony a few weeks later and they received my camera back, great.  Sony then told me they found corrosion inside the camera.  I said, yes, and that is why it failed.  I said it was due to a bad seal on the housing.  Sony agreed but they don't cover corrosion?  How can you make a waterproof camera and not cover corrosion?  The offer sony made was 190.00 for a new camera.  My question was, is there any improvements to the new camera or is it exactly the same?  They're answer is NO, it's the same camera!  So, sony wants me to pay 374.00 + 190.00=564.00 for a camera that isn't waterproof and has zero warranty?  DO NOT purchase this waterproof camera, there is zero warranty!

Mostly Canon. This is my first and last Sony product, I will ever purchase.The problem started when the camera started shutting down than it would not power up at all. Contacted Sony and trouble shot and tech agreed that it needed to be sent in for repair at my expense. I sent it in and 2 months went by with only an email stating that they received it. Got it back the other day with an invoice and no explanation to what was done or the findings. So I call tech support only to find out that they said they called which was not true. Also that it was unrepairable due to corrosion damage.Corrosion from what, it never went near water and it was kept in a padded pouch when not in use. So they refused to fix or replace it. They offered to sell me a new model \"TX-20 \"for 199.99 not including shipping, tax, and, the cost of shipping the new one. I just wanted the same camera back working. So They referred me to customer relations who offered 15% off new TX-20. Again, I just wanted my old one repaired or replaced. So I was escalated to Raven CTHD who said she was the highest, I could be escalated to. So guess what, now SONY's stance is that since it was supposed Corrosion damage on a WATERPROOF camera they will not honor the warranty and it is Void. So it has gone from bad to worse. So now I am stuck. I contacted Amazon and they say they can't help. So now I am stuck and out about 200.00 on a camera that I have had for less than a year.

The posts from those people didn't go into much detail, so I assumed they may have just done something wrong themselves. But I made sure to read all of the directions carefully (and being an Engineer, I am very particulate about things like this).I bought the camera brand new, and it looks awesome, fits right in my pocket, takes great pictures, and has the best video quality in any camera I've used. The pictures almost look too good sometimes - looks like they should be in a movie or something.With that said, I take it on my trip to Jamaica and start using it and love the quality of it - panoramic picture ability and the background defocus(When it works) are great. Then, our group decides to go on a little snorkel journey off shore... 10 feet deep at the most (this camera is rated for 16 feet). I am nervous of course, but hey, it's a waterproof camera... what could go wrong?Taking random pictures here and there, its working great and I think this is the coolest thing since sliced bread. I love being in the water and now I finally own a waterproof camera to capture my memories in it. Then about 5 minutes in, having never gone even deeper than probably 5 feet, the camera start-up logo appears on the screen, flickers a few times, then vanishes. The camera is officially dead, never to work again for the rest of my 7 day trip that I specifically purchased this camera for.I have yet to call Sony to complain since I literally just got back from my trip, and I'm not looking forward to doing so seeing the other reviewer's responses about their attempts to get it exchanged. I still had a great trip, but that was a hell of an easy way to piss me off for 3 or 4 hours and every time during the rest of the trip that I wanted to take a picture.Overall, the camera actually should be a 4-star if it was waterproof, but considering that WRECKS the camera, it is getting 1 star. Here's my quick pro/con rundown of the camera and other things for it that would give it a 4-star rating if everything actually worked as stated.PRO:- awesome picture quality, simple mode changing with touch screen- awesome video quality, sound was really great too- can zoom in and auto-focus during videos, and also take screen shots while video- panoramic auto-stitch is pretty darn awesomeconsidering these are the main things I look for in the camera, I was happy and these cons below I could live with... except for it not being waterproof of course.CONS:- seems to take awhile for some of the items to appear on the screen when trying to view in playback mode... including zooming in on photos. My camera from 4 years ago switches pictures faster/better and zooms in to view them immediately on the LCD screen, so why is this one so slow? (and yes, I'm using the recommended Sony memory stick for this camera that others have bought)- touch screen works for the most part, but can be annoying to use at times. Would probably rather just have tactile buttons- couldn't find a color swap option on here (my girlfriend loves using that feature just for fun and effects... and yes, I know you can do that on Photoshop, but it's about 500 times faster and easier when it's an option on the camera).- NOOOOOOOOOOOOOT WATERPROOOOOOOOOOOOOF. Splash proof, sure. But who purposely buys a waterproof camera to only use for 10 seconds at a time in the water?If I have no luck with Sony on either getting a new camera or getting my money back, I will make sure to update my results with that as well.*UPDATE* - see the comments for the hell I went through with the awful customer service in Texas and their ridiculous excuse for my \"misuse\" of the product.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera leaked", "Author": "Nick Sanpaolo", "ReviewID": "RKVCZJLE8XWCH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After 1 month camera got water into it and was announced by Sony as corrosion damage.

I think this is par for a Point and Shoot.  The additional modes (background defocus, HDR, burst mode) can produce some very cool shots.  Startup is not instant, movie mode especially, and sometimes focus can be wonky.  Shots with flash can be overexposed.

Generally, the camera has a great form factor.  It takes sharp images and has a lot of neat settings, including 3D and panoramic pictures.  This is a great little camera that is convenient and easy to take with you.  My first time ever getting it near water was about 3 months after I purchased it.  I was able to get one picture underwater before the screen started flashing black/gray and finally went out.  Upon further inspection I could see water floating around the lens and flash of the camera. I consider myself an extremely techie person and I had followed all the precautions to ensure it was correctly sealed but water got inside of it anyways. The fear then set in, because I had read many of these reviews on Amazon about people not ever getting a replacement item. Once I returned from my trip I paid $15 to get it sent in to sony and they called me a week later, saying it had indeed leaked and that there was corrosion inside, but that they would offer a new replacement.  Ideally it would be great if this camera never had leaked water, but I was appreciative that sony held up its warranty. I think the main difference in mine being replaced and potentially others not being replaced was the fact that my camera had no external blemishes on it, still appearing new.  I am wondering if others in the past potentially had a dent/scratch on it that made them think it could have lead to the water leak. I just know that they said that they didn't see any external damage that could have lead to it, so it must have been their problem. I don't know if I got lucky with a replacement, but I was impressed Sony took care of it, although they were unable to refund my return shipping for the replacement. I asked for further guidance when I received the replacement to ensure this would never happen again and all they kept repeating was to keep the camera clean and make sure no sand or dirt gets in any of the seals, which could potentially lead to water damage. I haven't decided if I'll use it completely underwater, but I am thinking I'll give it another chance and just hope my first one was a dud and move on. I bought the camera on black friday for one-hundred and sixty, so at that price point I feel it is definitely worth the buy. I'll be using it again in a few months and will update my post once I get this camera in water again.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Field Tested Water and Desert", "Author": "Brandon Gonzales \"RoughGearReviewDotCom\"", "ReviewID": "R30B72GH9Q8X4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took this camera out to the Badlands in the Anza Borrego desert twice and it worked flawless.

I reached in and took a couple of pictures. Camera still worked perfect. The camera takes excellent photos and in my opinion is a good buy. I have read reviews where people state it is not waterproof. Just be sure to double check the two hatches on the camera. One is for the battery and the other is for the HDMI port. Be sure these are closed tight. Then be sure to NOT re-open them until the camera is dry. Just one drop of water going inside the camera will ruin it. So don't check the battery while your standing in 5 feet of water. Other than that I did notice the part of the camera that slides open retained some dust.

Huynh", "ReviewID": "R2IHI3SSMA0NZ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the Sony TX10 in black as gift for X-Mas from my brother. I am not a professional photographer, but I do love gadgets of all sorts. I have a very good eye when it comes to form, function, efficiency and practicality. The TX10 is a very nice little camera. Let's start with the exterior. The measurements of the camera in inches are: 3 3/4 x 2 1/4 x 3/4 (length x width x depth). On the front of the camera, you have a slider cover that pulls down to take pictures and pushes up to protect the lens. Both the front and the sides of the camera have a matte finish exterior. On the back of the camera, you will find a touch screen made of glass about 3 1/4 inches in length and about 2 inches in width. The Sony TX10's exterior looks very sleek and stylish. I have no complaints on how it looks. The feel of it is not bad. It has good weight and is built solid. The only concern is that the exterior can be slippery due to its smooth finish. It would have been nice to have some texture to the finish for better gripping. But after doing some research on other cameras, I found out that a lot of other brand cameras in this class are the same way.Now I will discuss how the camera performs when taking pictures and user friendliness. The user interface (OS) may take a while to understand straight off the bat, but if you play around with it for a while, it will become easier to understand and navigate. Once you understand how to use its interface, the OS becomes second nature and you see the logic in why Sony has developed it that way. Taking pictures are easy. Just point and shoot. The pictures come out bright and the colors are vivid. In low lighted areas, the TX10 really does a good job of balancing the right amount of light to the pictures. Picture stabilization is above average. I tried blurring out pictures on purpose, and it was not an easy task. There are several options on sizing your pictures. I will not go into that because there isn't much to say. The camera does exactly what it promises to do when it comes to adjusting megapixels and size (4:3 or 16:9). The camera is also supposed to be water-proof. I will not go into that either because I have not tried it underwater and do not plan to in the near future.There are a couple of articles on the internet that state that the Sony TX10's touch screen is unreliable. Some writers state that using the touch screen is frustrating because the screen does not respond to touch very well. They state that they have to touch it twice and/or when they push the selected screen button, the camera pulls up something totally different. Here are my inputs on it (please read the entire input): When I first started using the camera, I would agree that the screen was weird or unresponsive to my touch. And I must say I was getting frustrated. Then after playing around with it for a couple of days, I started to understand that I have to touch the screen lightly for a better response. The screen does not respond to heavy touching or pushing for some reason. Also, there is a very good solution to this issue: \"a screen protector\". Coincidently, I also wanted to protect my screen from scratches; so I went out and bought a screen protector (I bought a screen protector for a cell phone and went home and cropped it to fit the TX10's screen). Man, am I glad I bought one! Once I applied the screen protector, I noticed that the camera's response to my touch was greatly increased. The difference was night and day. Adding a screen protector to the TX10's screen made the whole user experience with the touch screen much more pleasant. Navigating and adjusting settings became so much better. I would highly recommend you do the same if you have this camera.Conclusion: the Sony TX10 is an above average camera and a winner in its class. It has a nice design, a sleek look to it, it's compact, and takes very good pictures. I would definitely buy this brand and model again.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does everything", "Author": "Raj", "ReviewID": "R27I2OH2CRO164", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a pro photographer and this addition to my cameras was a great plus considering the 16.2MP, waterproof and shockproof.This is one of the best looking waterproof cameras in the market and is worth the $s.

I wanted a waterproof camera which would produce high-quality photos in all settings (indoor, outdoor, and underwater.  My intention was to completely replace my 7.2MP Sony DSC-W7, which I LOVE.  I wanted to add the underwater feature without compromising on other features.  I did not want to spend more than about $400 for everything (camera, two 8GB memory cards (Class 10), two extra batteries with charger, and float strap.  This left me with about $340 max to spend on the camera itself.  I do NOT know a lot about photography.  Terms like \"ISO\" and \"white balance\" are foreign to me.  I like to use pre-programmed scene modes and auto features.  I enjoy digital scrapbooking and I frequently zoom and crop.  It takes a very high quality photo to crop out/enlarge a small figure without too much distortion.I began my search online and spent about 6 hours researching the cameras in my price range.  The cameras I focused on most were the Canon D10, Sony TX10, Panasonic TS3 (sometimes referred to as FT3), Olympus TG-810, Olympus Tough 8010, Fujifilm XP30, and Pentax WG-1.I eliminated most of these options rather quickly based on their reviews, overall ratings, and the quality of photos that I reviewed.  I narrowed my focus to the Canon D10, the Sony TX10, and the Panasonic TS3.I wanted to love the Canon D10, since it seems to be the overwhelming fan favorite, but I ultimately decided that it wasn't going to be a good fit for me.  The price of the D10 is similar to the Sony and the Panasonic, but it's a 2.5 year old model which doesn't have HD video.  The photo quality seemed about equivalent to the other two, so I decided to only focus on the two models with HD video.I would have been completely sold on the Sony, since I've used only Sony cameras most of my adult life and I've never been disappointed in one; however, there were some notable deficiencies which most reviewers found with this model (detailed below), so I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge.  The Sony was also priced near the top of my budget ($329), whereas the Panasonic was only $275 at Amazon.com.  The Panasonic reviews seemed to all be very positive, with the only significantly commonly-noted problem being lower quality indoor photos.  However, all of the indoor, outdoor, and underwater photos that I reviewed online looked very good.I decided to take a chance on the Panasonic TS3 and I really, really, wanted to fall in love with it.  I ordered it from Amazon and they delivered it the next day.  I wasn't blown away by this camera.  The outdoor photos were good.  The video was very good.  The underwater photos (taken in my large fish tank) were very good.  The indoor photos were POOR.  I decided to order the Sony TX10, hoping that I'd see better results.  I ordered it from Amazon at 9pm that night and it was delivered at 1:00pm the next day (gotta love Amazon!).  The photo quality of the Sony camera is outstanding.  I'll be keeping the Sony TX10!!!  For some people, however, the Panasonic might be the better choice.First, I'll provide my overall recommendations, then I'll add in all of the detail:BUY THE SONY TX10 IF:You value the quality of the photos/video above all else.You like touch screen devices.You don't plan to dive lower than 16 feet.You don't care if you can't adjust your settings (other than zoom) underwater.You want a VERY small camera.You always use a wrist strap.BUY THE PANASONIC TS3 IF:You can live with grainy indoor photos.You don't typically enlarge your photos to 100% (because they will be distorted).You want a camera with GPS.You plan to dive deeper than 16 feet.You want a larger (but not too big) camera.You're looking for a less expensive option.NOW FOR MY DETAILED COMMENTS ON BOTH MODELS:PRICE - The Sony is +/- $50 more expensive than the Panasonic.SIZE - The Sony is significantly smaller and lighter than the Panasonic.  I don't think one is better than the other, per se.  It's a matter of personal preference.  The Sony will fit in most pockets.  The Panasonic probably wouldn't.RUGGEDNESS - Both cameras are rated very well in this area.  I haven't \"tested\" them, but it seems like the Panasonic is built a bit tougher and would be less likely to get destroyed in a fall.  Rather than test this feature, I'm going to just trust the experts that either one will hold up well if dropped.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great photo's but a rather fragile camera.", "Author": "craig lines", "ReviewID": "R2OF7EAGMRB2EZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We live in the Bahamas and naturally spend a lot of time in the water and at the beach.

I beat the crap out of that old one, never put it in a case and it went with me everywhere. On a recent trip to Thailand, someone had this new model and I got to check it out. Not only is it an updated version of the camera I loved, with touch-screen, HD video and 16MP but it is also waterproof? Are you kidding? So I've been using it for a few weeks and so far so good. I like that I don't have to take the battery out to charge it and the picture quality is great. I love the large LCD screen while the overall size makes it easy to travel. The HD video quality exceeds my expectations. I even got a mini-HDMI cable to hook it to my HD TV. Pretty amazing! I did have to upgrade from the old Memory Stick Pro Duo to an SD Ultra so it could better handle the image size and HD video (something I didn't realize at first) but the cost of SD cards has come down quite a bit anyway. The fact that it now accepts Memory Stick and SD makes it pretty versatile (the old Memory Sticks worked fine, it just made the camera a bit slower to use between pictures as the write-time was slower.) My only real complaint at this point (and it's not a show-stopper) is that the touch-screen operation is not as intuitive as I would expect.

I couldn't find waterproof subcompacts in stores but did try out the non-waterproof versions of several subcompacts and found the Sony produced the most true-to-life colors. I ordered the Sony TX10 and was happy with my initial \"test drive,\" which was done using fully-automatic mode.

I recently sold the TX7 when I got the TX10. I was very excited that sony was releasing a new cyber shot, so I quickly snapped one up.  I am not a professional photographer by any means, but I am becoming more and more interested in it as a hobby.The TX10 is a great camera with most features you don't see in many point-and shoots. Comparing this to the TX7, I find that there are many improvements (obviously one of them being that that TX7 is 10.2mp and the TX10 is 16.2mp), but other than that, I find the low light correction to be much better.Although the TX10 is a waterproof camera, I have not tested how it works underwater ... still very much iffy about doing that with a $300+ piece of equipment despite it's claims.So, i'll separate my review into pros and cons, based only on my experience with the TX10, which I have had for a couple of weeks now:Pros:- awesome image quality for a point and shoot.- smaller when compared to the TX7, which makes for easier portability- fairly easy to operate-  very sleek, modern, compact design, fits easily in a pocket or purse.- the touch screen is nice, but almost half pro / con (for reasons i'll get into below.)- includes a stylus pen, which although not usually needed since I find the screen responds better to touch than to the pen, it's still a nice option- very nice macro mode.- during a test video, I was impressed with the video quality and the fact I could capture stills directly from the video as it was being recorded.Cons:- Price. This camera is about $100 more than the TX7, and at the $330 price range, I would have expected better performance. Instead, this almost feels like a downgrade ...- only one year warranty. Does not seem like enough.- battery life is not very good. Even after a full charge, and the screen brightness on low or medium, the camera dies after 40 minutes of continuous shooting and needs to be charged again. Very annoying.- why is the on/off button RIGHT next to the shutter? this is pretty annoying for the reason of \"let me take a shot ... oops, accidently turned it off instead..\"- it sometimes has problems focusing ... usually, it will have this problem in low light situations, but even in better lighting conditions, it still refuses to focus. - the touch screen is possessed. As you'll probably read in other reviews of the TX10, it's erratic half of the time, and way too sensitive the other half of the time. Most of the time it will select an option that I could have *sworn* I was no where near. I do not remember having this issue on the TX7, which also had a touch screen, but seemed to somehow work a lot better. The touch screen could be vastly improved.- This one is probably my own fault due to the fact i'm still new to the camera, but the \"de-focus\" feature doesn't always work as expected. Often, if you select the focus on the touch screen of the object you want to photograph, it takes many taps of the screen for the screen to focus in the area you selected. Often if you enter macro mode by zooming in or just getting closer to the object, and then take a picture, if you are too close or too far away, it will tell you \"failed to perform defocus\". And it does tell you in cm how far to stand away, but ... kind of difficult to determine if you're stepping 20cm or 10 cm away ... or maybe that's just me.- Another annoyance of the defocus feature that I notice on my photos is, if it's a larger object and i've set the blur to be around the object instead of the inital focus point (also I think depending on the blur strength, low, mid, or high), I can some times see little blur marks where there was no focus. I am not sure if this is me doing something incorrectly or a defect of the camera, but I found it odd. Usually the background would be out of focus and the object would be infocus, creating depth in the image, but there would be tiny specks away from the blurred background IN parts of the focused image. Not sure if that's the way it's supposed to work or not.- The TX10 comes with a USB cord and a USB wallcharger port instead of a seperate wall charger port that simply charges the battery. These function as both the transfer cord AND the charger cable. This can be both a pro and a con, since people who use their computers often can simply charge the camera while using the computer, and just one small cable is easier to carry. However, it can also be slightly annoying because the camera does not really give you any indication, once it's plugged in, that it is charging. At first I couldn't tell if it was the yellow or green light that meant it was charging ... so better read up on the manual, I guess.- the 3D features only sound impressive in theory. In reality, they lose their interesting \"ooh, ahh\" effect after 5 minutes. I feel that if sony spend more time improving the more important, functional features of the camera, instead of adding pointless gimmicks, the camera would have been much better off.- wasn't impressed with the \"Sweep panorama\". It was confusing to perform and didn't let me take just a short pan of the area, which would have been nice.- reading another review, I also have to agree that the shutter button is flaky. When the camera first starts up, you have to wait for the touch screen menu to appear before the shutter button functions, and the touch screen is not always responsive.I may add more cons later, and perhaps i'll even sell my TX10 in favor of a better model. But for now, this a cute and simple point and shoot that takes decent images.  The touch screen sounds impressive at first, but i'd rather not fight with an unresponsive or erratatic screen.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not good.", "Author": "Tarik Potthoff \"Tarik\"", "ReviewID": "R3NMDAWIJFA0CT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I use to have the TX5.

I understand that image quality will differ, however, there comes a point when the difference is too vast to tolerate.  However, between the folded lens design and the excessive noise reduction that Sony insists on adding to the JPEGs and video, I could not justify keeping the camera.  Had Sony offered RAW image options, we might find some keepers in the pictures that I took.  However, if people judge the pictures from this camera to be excellent, they have not seen what other cameras can do.  The other issue has to do with megapixel counters.  I own an old Fuji E900 that is 9 MP, offers RAW images, and simply blows this camera away.  The point here is that 16 MP is useless if the lens configuration, and image capture limitations (excessively noise reduced JPEGS) destroy the megapixel potential. In this case, this camera would give no better images if it were a 6 MP camera.  There are simply too many weak links in the chain to give the 16 MP the quality that it might have enjoyed.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "60i video looks like 30p (with low light) - I expected more", "Author": "Pablo D.

I have small hands and they're exceptionally small buttons, so it's hard to use. And it doesn't recognize my hands half the time, I assume because they're too cold. While other times it will click when I'm still a millimeter away. (That's not exactly a con, it's kinda nice.) Stylus is almost necessary for scrolling.~3D doesn't work on the screen? I don't have a 3D tv, but I guess the camera itself can't view them or I'm doing it wrong.~Panoramic is touchy. It's nice, but I'm not a fan of the shaky new sweep mode they're pounding into us.~The front slide holds water, so it will need to be dried for ~5 times whenever you open and close it before all the water drains.~Battery life could be better.

They sent me another one that was falling apart when I got it, I sent it back again and they glued it together but it never worked right.  I have a $300 piece of crap.

Unless you are making films,  the video quality from this camera will be more than enough.  -Durability is great: I have dove with this camera down to 3-4x the recommended depth, taken a beating in a big surf wave,  frozen it in the snow and dropped it all over the place and it hasn't failed yet.Cons:  -Battery life is a little short and it drains fast with videos  -Screen scratches easily  -Once the camera is wet (and your hands are) you cannot change any functions on the touch screen.  Set it up beforehand.  -Long start up time, and it displays a warning screen about shutting all the doors every time.  Not good for reaction shots  -3D shots are just silly in my opinion.Sure one of these days the seals will give and I will drown this camera, and I won't be surprised if Sony tells me they wont warranty it.

It does take good pics and video.Downsides:The sliding opening is cool...I love it. But, it does not love the ocean. Nope. So, now it has scratches on it. You can turn it on with a button on top so I would suggest that when you have it in the ocean to just leave it open and use the button to turn it on and off to avoid scratching.I also have the same camera only a year older and not waterproof...and that camera will take pics in low-light conditions a lot better. This one after dusk always gives me blur (I don't use/dislike flash) but the older one like it will do a bit better. So, that was a little disappointing.The touch screen is less responsive than my iPhone so it always irritates me when I use it. I don't know if it's the camera or me. Also...the touch screen is iffy (if it will respond) when you are using it in the water.

The canon was good until the now infamous \"lens error\" issue came up (Returned).Maybe I'm just lucky, but I've used the SONY underwater for hours at a clip in pools, fresh water, saltwater with never an issue - but I will say I've never gone deeper than 15 ft. I've been pretty consistent about rinsing it after use and making sure any sand/grit is cleaned out of the cover. I even go so far as to open the doors downward just in case there's a drop of water (which has happened once).Feature wise, there is no equal. Standard pictures are good, and I really love the burst mode. The movies function is slow to start, but other wise I'm pleased with its quality. The panoramic function is also 1 I use all the time. The zoom is limited, but I knew that when I got this otherwise feature rich camera.Bottom line for me - there's no other camera that offers all these features.

I bought a blue one in August 2011, so it's been about a year using it as my only camera. I work outside in all kinds of weather and go on vacations (mostly to hang out outdoors) a lot, so I was looking for a camera that could keep up with me and also capture the beautiful vistas I visit regularly. So far, so good!For me, it IS waterproof, I just clean the rubber catches protecting the electronic bits before I go underwater. If you are super paranoid, electrical tape over the doors also works.None of my other point and shoot digital cameras could capture evening scenes, quickly moving birds, etc. to any decent degree. This one, on just the regular mode, beautifully caught the fireworks at NYE in Sydney while I was there. And then immediately turned around and captured the people on the boat with me, dancing and celebrating, perfectly.I've taken it snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef twice, hiking in torrential rains, snowboarding and skiing, to many beaches, on a zillion road trips, in/under a waterfall, and actually...everywhere I go. It sits in its case in my backpack, and is always ready to go if I see something interesting I want to shoot--it happens a lot here in NZ. It's compact and great for travel.I LOVE that you can capture stills while in video mode.I do have a few warnings for those that intend to buy it:1) The panorama mode is too panaramic! I wish it didn't capture so MUCH width, and got a little more height. I barely use that function because I have to actually turn almost 360 degrees in order for the camera to say it's finished taking the panorama. It's virtually useless feature, along with the 3D, which I've never had a use for.2) The lag time between photos gets annoyingly long sometimes, when things are happening quickly and unexpectedly. We don't all have 2 minutes to play and get the perfect settings for each shot.3) Sometimes it doesn't register that I want to take a photo, probably because my hand is touching the touchscreen whilst holding up the camera for the photo. Conversely, when I actually want to use the touchscreen, it usually takes a while and several taps for it to register what I'm trying to do. I don't understand that.4) The lens is too close to the edges of the camera. While I have gotten used to it, when I hand my camera off to others to take pictures of me and friends, their fingers tend to block some or all of the lens because it is just placed awkwardly for most people.All in all, minor issues to me because it takes such beautiful regular shots.

Not to mention, only about 2 out of 10 pictures that DO end up working look like they are about an 8mp. NOT a 16mp.Annoying lag for the menu buttons when trying to go through everything. I try pushing the screen about 3 times before it will work.I like things fast with quality. Especially when it claims to claim what it does.The 3d is hilarious. It's called, they put it in 'fish eye' mode and call it 3d. It's nothing CLOSE to 3d.I have been so disappointed with this so far that I haven't even attempted to try the 'waterproof' feature, just in case it really DOESN'T work, and I can't return it.I give it so many stars as it has because it is portable, unlike my nice big camera, it is waterproof (I think) and if by chance I can get a good picture, it will take a good picture.Thats about it!Sony really dropped the ball on this one, for what it claims.Not worth $300...

Unexpectedly, I love video quality! Yes, startup is slow (if you are in iA mode, faster in dedicated movie mode), especially for the first clip. But even in low light (incandescent in-door) video is great and wide angle is very useful (I actually use TX10 as second camera for video shots with Panasonic GH2). Also image stabilization helps a lot for small camera handheld shots.2. Exposure and focus is mostly accurate.3. I really don't do pixel peeking a lot. Photos do have \"plastic\" look and lack details. This as well as relative slowness of operation (startup, image review, first video shot), smaller screen and poor ergonomics prevent (very awkward holding it while shooting video) are big downsides still.--------------------I own Canon SD750, which is 4-year old 7 megapixel camera.My first impressions for TX10:Bad things:1. Compared to the older camera, TX10 offers LESS image details, despite more than twice pixels (50%+ more in each dimension). I wish I could attach crops, but do image search yourself \"TX10 noise reduction\". This is the case where more means less.2. Ergonomics for TX10 is poor. Shutter button is small, touch screen controls are pain in the a$$. First thing I did was turning off screen controls, not to touch it accidentally.3. Screen is small and has 16:9 aspect ratio. This means that 4:3 picture has black bars on either side and actual diagonal for 4:3 is only 2.2\". I had to change to 16:9 (12M) picture aspect ratio for better framing.4. Video recording takes 3-5 seconds to start! Here goes the moment...Neutral:1. Small to carry around, though not smaller than SD750 and slightly heavier2. I dont really care for scratches, but it does scratch very easily (black coat is very thin)3. I'm fine with complete lack of manual controls. I always found that PASM modes on compact cameras (with choice of what, 2 aperture values) is more of a gimmick anyway. EV compensation would be nice to have, though - for those sunset shots.Good things:1. Except for video (and small delay in reviewing images) the camera is responsive. Startup and auto focus are very fast.2. Great wide angle!3. Images are well exposed and good white balance.4. Good flash use5. Good video qualityI'm yet to test it's water/shock proof abilities, but with 2 kids around this will not be long!I'm on the verge, whether to keep the camera or not. Image quality and screen are somewhat of a step down. If not the price (and portability/weight) I would get Panasonic TS3 instead. I also consider keep using SD750.On the other hand, I did pay good price on Black Friday (<$200). And the best camera is the one you have on you!

Set the camera in the video mode helps to improve it- response time of the trouch-screen especially when you look at your picture- limited optical zoom (it seems technically tough to have both very small camera and a big zoom though)- limited stamina of the battery (i have bought an additional battery of 1200 mAh and it helps, but for the price Sony should provide something more serious)- price (you pay for the waterproof feature) - $40 off would be fair- slow software from time to time, it needs corrections. But don't worry, it works- the touch-screen doesn't work under water. Worst: if you use the camera during a rainy day, you can hardly use the touch-screen if there are water drops on it... hopefully the buttons are there for the basic use but it is impossible to change the setting under water and it makes it hard when the display is wet (wet fingers, etc...) which is strange for a waterproof camera- Sony's specific USB port on the camera: you need the Sony's cable to charge the camera and you cannot use generic cables. If you loose the cable during a travel and you don't have a charger, you are done.- focus during videos might be slow sometimes for dark conditions- I would have appreciated to have an option to cut some portions of the videos directly with the camera- No HD cable in the box- Basic user manual that does not explain all the functions. You need to go on internet to have full explanations. However, the \"help\" function of the camera is really good.Conclusion: I can live with the bads of this camera because the goods are really good.

During and after the trip, I feel certain that the Sony DSC-TX10 met our expectations.Pros - Panorama feature - Wide angle lens.  Got some great pics of the landscape and a large group of people.  Other folks had cameras that required the folks in our group to get very close together. - Underwater - the camera was soaked during trips down the river, through waterfalls and held up great.  No problems with camera or pics.  In fact, we used the camera in an aquarium and took video of rays and small fish and the video was excellent. - Most features via the touchscreen were easy to use...but there were some that were difficult to find.Cons - Battery Life could be better.  I bought an extra battery and the GoalZero solar panels/charger for this trip.  I was able to use the GoalZero to charge the battery twice...which helped. - Telephoto Zoom is not that great.  Fortunately, we had another digital camera with a great zoom.  however, if you want some good closeup/zooms then you should test out the camera at a store before purchasing. - Touchscreen features...some were difficult to find in the menu system. - Proprietary Sony PMB Software required to convert videos for sharing.  With our other digitial cameras, we could simply give someone the SD card and they could take the pics and video.  With this camera, the pics can be shared off the SD card...but you have to use the Sony software to import and convert to a format to share (.Wav, etc).", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "Carlos", "ReviewID": "RDMRTW3TE9DV6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After my last sony point and shoot camera started acting up I found myself in the market for a new camera.  I'd been thinking about those Olympus waterproof cameras for a while but could never get past their bulky looks.  When I saw this camera online I was surprised that it had the same features as the others and was packed into this slim, sleek design.  So I took a chance.  I'm glad I did.First off, it totally works in and around water.  The first night I had it I put it into a bowl of water just to test.  The next day, and the following weekends, I took it into the pool and have managed to get some nice pictures of my kids playing in the water.  The picture quality is great and the video quality is great too.  I haven't had a chance to get through half of the settings on this thing but so far I am very pleased with it.  It does great in low light conditions (even without the flash) and even better when you're outside.I have two complaints.  One is battery life.  After fully charging it and going to the pool for an hour I brought it home and let is sit to dry.  I didn't use it for a few days and when I finally decided to look through the pics I had taken the battery was completely dead.  I had to connect the data cable to it (not a huge deal) but I felt it should not have died from just sitting there.  My other complaint is that the lens can get hazy quite easily in the water, but I attribute that to the chemicals in the water and do not fault the camera itself.  I find myself having to get out of the water to wipe the lens clean at least a couple of times each trip to the pool.Overall this is a great looking camera and it does work as advertised.  I'm happy with the picture and video quality and do not regret purchasing this item.  I was very worried about the water tightness at first (never owned a waterproof camera before) but as I mentioned I've had no problems with the water.Don't forget to get your memory card for it since one is not included with the camera.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Best I've had", "Author": "Ivanurba", "ReviewID": "R8PBGU02ZKRJU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Simple the best i've had.... quality, speed, durability... the only thing i strugle with is changing the settings from submarine pics to normal... it is not that quick and i lost very good moments to capture.... but i'm really happy with it...", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera!", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R3GKNMVSTP6OV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "only took 9 days till it was in my hands.

The TX10 has excellent low light capabilities, wonderful smart modes (such as background defocus), fun instant panoramas, phenomenal HD video with dolby stereo sound, and it is truly waterproof.

I thought I would share my findings as they may be useful.  According to the Sony USA website, the TX10 is NOT on the list of compatible cameras and the live chat rep (Analyst_Sean) repeated that info back to me.  However, my googling lead me to what Sean told me was the Sony Asia page which specifically references the MPK-THJ housing as being the correct one [...].  Also, on page 8 of the instruction manual for the DSC-TX10 [...] it specifically references an available Marine Pack housing but does not have a model number.  So I finally had to call the Sony Style Sales Support Team (1-877-865-7669 M-F 5-9 and Sat/Sun 7-4 PST).  Georgina answered and told me that even though it was not on their list she thought it was compatible as the TX5 is on the compatible list and the TX10 is the upgraded version of the TX5.  She transferred me over to a specialist (Robert) whom I explained the situation to (conflicting info and all that) and he put me on hold and then came back.  I was under the impression that he had physical access to the pieces in question as he was comfortable confirming that even though the TX10 is a different physical size than the TX5, it is still compatible with the MPK-THJ casing.  If I had not found corresponding evidence on the Sony Asia Pacific site, I would probably be hesitant, but between the two, I plan on ordering both the camera and the housing.Regards,StevenAmazon Marine Pack Housing $160 (http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MPKTHJ-DSC-Marine-Pack/dp/B00336EHES/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top)", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Slooooooow", "Author": "Jared S.", "ReviewID": "R2G1JI1FQK1CQR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera took okay pictures.

I really wanted it to work.Pros:-Small, compact size.  Sliding cover is very nice and turns camera on/off when moved.-Picture quality is good for a compact point and shoot.  Sony technology with panoramas and low light shooting (takes multiple shots, then combines them for low noise photo) is impressive.-Touch screen is intuitive.  Some complain about lack of responsiveness with the touch screen, but this didn't seem to be an issue for me.-Snaps photos reasonably fast (not much delay once you press the shutter).-Very nice wide angle lens.  This is a very rare thing among waterproof cameras.Cons:-Video.  Takes forever to start.  By the time you've started your video, you've missed the moment.-Video.  It's surprisingly and unfortunately very grainy.  I've compared it to another point and shoot we have (Samsung), and the difference is enormous.-Expensive.  But Sony does pack in a lot of technology in this little package.I wanted this camera to work so much that I purchased it twice.  The first time I saw the video, I thought it must be a Q&A; issue or bad unit. So I returned it.A month or so later I purchased another one from a different place.  I quickly tested the video quality, hoping that it would be clear and better.No such luck. Still grainy and noisy.  Even on the highest quality video setting.Video for this type of camera is critical for me, so I ended up returning the second purchased TX10.Really wanted to keep it.
