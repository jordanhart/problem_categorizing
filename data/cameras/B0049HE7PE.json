It has great quality pictures, easy to use.  It was a little confusing trying to figure out how to recall the pictures, but that didn't take long. I definitely recommend buying this camera or brand.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Kodak easy share M531 camera", "Author": "Sheryl J.

I have an older version of Kodak easy share and it was a great camera compared to this one.

Compact. Fairly lightweight. Good quality photos.I haven't used the easy share button and probably won't. My personal feeling is it's a bit of a gimmick.A nice touch is when you finish saving your photos onto your computer it asks if you want to delete them from your camera. My old one didn't do that.The video images come out really crisp and clear compared to my old camera.A really nice thing about this camera and the reason I bought it was that it has a rechargeable battery. My last camera needed two AA batteries each time and it went through them pretty quickly.This camera is nicely priced and will save you money if you are currently using one that requires disposable batteries.Just don't loose it down at the beach like my wife did! We never got it back, and my reason for coming on Amazon was to price another one!!!", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT!", "Author": "B. H.
