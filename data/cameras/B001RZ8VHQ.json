The construction is all metal so it has a nice solid heavy feel to it. Images are decent in day and night operation. And the price is nice. It includes the power supply brick and a camera surveillance sticker. Don't forget to order cable... I ordered 100 ft Video power Siamese BNC RCA cable for CCTV Security Cameras CBV100 1JE they also have this in 50ft, but I got the 100ft for more leeway.

This camera is more waterproof and weather resistant than the standard bullet cameras that came with the original system. The camera is very heavy for it's size, but that is an indication of the quality material that it is construction from.Installation is very easy as one side of the cable is the video feed and the other is the power connector. The lens in this camera has a wide range of view to cover a wide area. If you need greater distance, Warehouseseller has other models with 4-9mm lens, that will increase distance. I know because I just purchased one.I mention Warehouseseller because there has been reports that some companies have been selling bootleg VIDEOSECUR cameras.Warehouseseller is NOT one of them.I checked with the manufacturer to ensure that my camera was legitimate despite the lower discounted price Warehouseseller charged!The only person that is going to regret this purchase is the homies crusing my hood.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best wide-view (fish-eye) for the money.", "Author": "Mike the K", "ReviewID": "R29KZLBFODBVAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a wide-view or fish-eye type camera.  Works well day and night.This model when placed over the front (ceiling mount) door will cover about 10ft of the pourch left and right, and about 10-15ft of the steps and walk. This camera isalso good for covering most of the backyard or the street. For the driveway or othernarrow area you want a non-fish-eys lens (bullet type): there are several choices like the videosecu 1Z (advertised as fish-eye, but is NOT).Night viewing can get murky if there is no ambient lighting.  The infrared LEDswork well over a small area, like your front steps or porch. If you want to see outinto the street, 25-50 feet, then it gets a little murky if you don't have a street light.No you can't read license plates at 50ft with this: for that you'll need to spend a lot ($$$) more.I've bought six or these cameras and some others.  I've set up my house, my brothers house, and a friends house; someone was messing with his cars: not anymore. Get a four or eight channel DVR to record and view.The output of this camera is TV friendly; just plug into the TV's composite (RCA) input with a BNC-RCA adaptor (about a buck and some cameras come with one).I mounted two-of these fish-eys camera on the second floor and I can see up and down the street: my entire block (no trees).These cameras use a BNC/power cable (all-in-one) you can get 25ft-150ft: cost $10.00 to $15.00 depending on length and quality. The power supply plugs in inside the house (near where you plug into the TV or DVR; the other end runs to the camera to get the video feed and supply power.Mounting the camera is easy, just a few screw into the shingle, aluminum siding, or porch roof. Runing the cable and aiming the camera takes a litte time. You can run the cable through a window (open a crack with some foam insulation to keep out the cold), or if thats too cheesy then drill a hole where you cable TV goes in the basement.Video survaillance won't stop anyone from doing anything, but most people when they see visible cameras will go somewhere else to do it.  That includes dog-walkers.Want to know what time your kids really came home last night or who they had over?Big Brother is watching us. Linden, NJ already has 3 camera controled intersections ($85.00 to run the red).MK", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Night vision not good, grainy", "Author": "James M Lam", "ReviewID": "R1J2RSM4DYFQZ9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have used Video Secu cameras and they are good cameras, however this particular camera is not so good. I took down a night owl (great cameras) to replace it with this wide angle so it would cover my entire backyard. I hooked this camera up to my 8 channel Zmodo (that I have had for 3+ years) video recorder with 6 other camera's and I was not very happy. With the specs this camera has, (700 TV lines, Sony 1/3, 28 IR lights) you would think this camera would shine. None of my cameras have 700 TV lines and they are all great cameras. This camera is very grainy day and night. The IR would probably be ok if the camera was not so grainy. I have two night owls with only 20 IR lights and 420 TV lines that I have had since I bought my Zmodo recorder that are still working great, that out perform this camera by a long shot.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks good so far", "Author": "Malster1", "ReviewID": "ROH62S9JKVDBS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just received the camera today, but when I googled the model number on the box VD22B the maker, Videosecu.

The visability is down since those lights no longer work. The camera does not have good angles. When you install this camera you have to play around with it to get the angle you want. I had to install something behind the backing at an angle to get what i needed. The power supply is really short which can be difficult to place in certain spots.
