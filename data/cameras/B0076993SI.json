The specs on this camera are great, but Canon really made a mistake with the touchscreen.  First of all, this screen, while dense with pixels, is not as \"rich\" as previous models in terms of saturation.  Regarding the \"touch\" controls, the screen is slow to respond, and requires too many motions and movements with your fingers to accomplish what was very quick on previous \"button\" models. If your fingers are medium or large size, you will have great difficulty scrolling through menus.  For me, it was extremely frustrating and ended up in a return. I think the move to plastic for the exterior case was a mistake.  The 320HS felt cheap in comparison to the previous models which came with all metal bodies. While this camera overcomes many of the negatives of the 310HS model, I do not believe that it is an overall better option than the 300HS, which can be picked up for about half the price. If however, you expect to use the WiFi feature, then please be aware that the 300HS does not support it.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "A nice substitute for my digital SLR camera", "Author": "gadgetjunkie", "ReviewID": "RI7ZD2H9A5I1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have two Canon digital SLRs (10D and 30D) and I'd stopped carrying them around because they were simply too big and bulky for most situations. I've probably missed out on hundreds of great shots as a result.I was going to get the new mirrorless Canon EOS-M because it would allow me to use my existing lenses (my favorite lens is the $700 Canon 17-40mm wide angle), but after looking at the EOS-M online and reading the reviews, I wasn't convinced that it would be pocketable or worth the high price.After a lot of research, I finally found this Elph 320HS with the wide angle lens and checked out a lot of sample photos online. I was floored that this little camera was producing the kinds of pictures I was seeing no matter if the subject was a person, landscape, architecture, flower, etc...  The color, sharpness and features impressed me so much that I had to get one.I'm happy to say that this little camera takes photos that rival my digital SLRs.I'm most impressed by the manual features and the amount of customization I can do to get the perfect shot.  I can even crank the ISO up to 3200 and still get good results.  I can set shutter speeds of 1 to 15 seconds.  I'm able to use the wi-fi without any trouble and view/download my pictures to my HTC Evo phone.  The 5.2 shots per second high speed burst mode is great for action shots, not to mention the 1080p movie mode.As others have noted here, the touch screen is not very responsive to finger touch like a smartphone touch screen.  It is, however, 100% responsive when you touch it with an object like a stylus or your fingernail.  There is actually a plastic stylus with a little pointy tip built into the wrist strap (as noted on page 14 in the owner's manual).  When you use the wrist-strap stylus or your fingernail, the touch screen works like any other and responds immediately to your input.To accompany the camera, I also purchased the SanDisk Extreme 32 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s (SDSDX-032G-X46), Canon 5601B001 Deluxe Soft Camera Case PSC-2070, Black and Power2000 NB-11L Replacement Lithium-Ion Battery, 3.6 volt 900mAh, for Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS Series CamerasThe one thing I don't like is that the battery has to be removed from the camera to charge it.  It is very inconvenient to have to do this.  I have to do this with my other Canon cameras as well, so I'm not surprised, but it would be nice if the battery could be charged while in the camera.This camera has so many features and so much flexibility, it will definitely accompany me everywhere I go.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "It connects to PC over WiFi", "Author": "A. Rathi \"n0mad\"", "ReviewID": "R3QT3NJNFZPG4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera today and I was very curious to find out if I can connect it to my PC over WiFi after reading one of the reviews here.I knew that it should be possible as there is nothing which should prohibit that if the camera can connect to WiFi. I took some pictures and then tried to play around with the camera. I do not read manuals as they are lengthy and who has time! I clicked on the WiFi option on the touch screen and I saw four choices depicted by pictures. Connect to a Camera, Phone, PC/Mac and Internet. I chose PC and then it went through the process of connecting to my Wireless AP. Just like a Mac, it figured out the Authentication and Encryption methods automatically. After connecting to my home Wireless, it automatically found out that my Laptop was \"ON\" and started to establish a connection to it. It failed first time, I immediately knew that the issue was because of my Software Firewall. I disabled the firewall and it failed again. I checked the Windows Firewall and it was ON. I disabled that too and voila, I was able to connect and download photos to my Windows PC. Well I knew that speeds will be slower than the hard-wired connection and Canon can do nothing about it. That's how WiFi works at present. If you need faster speeds you can upgrade you AP to support 802.11n (because the camera supports it).This is my second post on Amazon.com even though I am a regular buyer since 2002. The main reason I thought to write this post was as another user mentioned that it is not possible to copy files over WiFi. I was a bit sad when I read that(as I had made my mind to buy this one) but I still moved forward with buying the camera as I wanted to see it myself and now when I have found that I CAN copy the files over WiFi, I thought to write this post as other users/buyers are not misguided.Regarding the camera, I find the pictures taken from my old S95 crisper than this one but then this camera is $100 cheaper than S95(which has wider aperture, better ISO and larger sensor).I cannot write more regarding the camera as I just received it and still playing with it. Also I do not see any issue with battery compartment as well (contrary to what another buyer reviewed).", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Real Cool Camera", "Author": "Singh is King", "ReviewID": "R1ZGU90ZGLHJR7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a nice Point n shoot camera and when I found this newly released product from the Canon family I knew it's going to be a great product. Today I received it and has taken some 50 pics with it, and I must tell you it's really cool.I should tell you that I own D60 DSLR and also has some L lens. But I wanted to have a nice Point and Shoot which I can just take it when I really don't want to carry my big D60.- This Camera feels like a nice touch screen phone in your hand, light and sleek. And it does have many features that you get on many smartphone, like setting your colors, themes, shutter sound, switch on sound etc.- It's built quality is much better than many other Point and shoot that I have used in the past.- The touch screen is not really good, may be we have used so many nice smart phones with touch screen that we now expect every touch screen product to work like a iPhone. But once you get used to the behavior you would find it okay.- I really like the fact that you can just connect this to Wi-fi and share your pics directly to Facebook or can also email. No more connecting the cable to transfer the photos.- The screen is really nice and feels strong. It would not really need a screen protector, but I think I may get one for extra protection. But I feel it may not get scratches that easily.The only thing that I would have liked is better manual. It wasn't easy to figure out the settings to set up your Facebook and email account on this camera.Overall I think Canon has got another great product and would be a definite hit.Update: 04/2/2012I tried the HD Video with this camera and recorded few video ranging from very short to 10-15 mins. The Video quality and auto focus is really nice.However I think with touch screen and Wi-fi the battery life is compromised.

Barr \"Mythicbells Persians\"", "ReviewID": "R3HKUTNIG50GTB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I REALLY wanted to like this camera. Initially I only needed to upgrade.  I have two older Canon ELPH series cameras (8 mp and 10 mp) and love them both.  I take a lot of photos and videos and especially wanted full HD video capability.  Although I like Canon, I considered a number of other brands as well.  The minute I saw that cameras were now coming out with the WiFi option I was intrigued.  I already upload both photos and videos from my android phone and my android tablet directly to both Facebook and YouTube.  After a week of research I settled on the Canon ELPH 320.  I spent a week working with it.  The touch screen works fine and the quality of both photos and videos seemed quite good.  However the WiFi option was a total disappointment.  I never did get it to recognize either of my two PCs despite turning off firewalls and any thing else I could think to do.  Well, I figured I could live without that.  It does upload directly to YouTube as advertised but I must have missed the small print on the \"direct upload to Facebook\" option.  It uploads to Canon's cloud once you create an account.  Frankly, I've always found it irritating when someone wants me to go check out their photos and sends me a link to Kodak or some other album in the cyber cloud, usually requiring me to sign up for yet another account.  The Facebook icon does appear on the camera's sharing screen and it will upload photos, but it uploads to the Canon account, not Facebook.  Apparently you then post to your \"friends\" the link and they go look at your photos there.  A small bit of mis-leading advertising on Canon's part in my opinion, assuming there was nothing I overlooked.  I might have been able to shine on the whole WiFi thing but I had one more complaint.  The audio in the videos sounded slightly muffled to me compared to my older cameras.  I turned off the wind damper option and made sure I didn't have any fingers over the microphones and took sample videos comparing the new camera audio with the old camera's.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't my imagination.  The audio on the ELPH 320 wasn't as good.I could very well discover that will be the case with all the HD cameras and the stereo audio, but I hope not.  I'm returning the camera and, as much as I would like the WiFi idea, I fear that technology in the camera market has just not caught up yet with the phones and the tablets, so I'll opt for a less feature rich camera and try again.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product!", "Author": "lina", "ReviewID": "R1UXIZKI9EWAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera just before my trip to Chicago and my timing could not have been more perfect.

We went walking around the streets later and even though I was moving this camera took the pictures so fast that I did not have any burry pictures.

In other words, my Elph 320 will be with me when I go out and my S95 will be on a shelf at home.  Yes, the S95 has great specs... but I have a Nikon DSLR for serious manual controls and fast 1.4 lens take on the world (vs S95/S100 2.0 lens).....I was most apprehensive about the 320's touchscreen....  I tested it in-store and immediately realized it's not as refined as the Apple touchscreen (iPhone/Touch), where you can use your finger pads.  But.....all you have to do is use your freaking nails and it's fine!  Tap the screen with your nail you're good to go (can't believe I just used that phrase).Additionally, the 320's camera strap comes with a plastic 'stylus' to tap the screen for you (!)......  Why wasn't this known in the early pre-release reviews???????  Poor intelligence gathering...  The manual says, \"If you have difficulty operating he camera by touch, use the stylus attached to the strap.\"  OK whatever, you can use your fingernail or the stylus, either will work fine.Frys only had Red and Blue colors.  Guess what?  The so-called Red is actually Hot Pink!!!!  Girls (or festive men?), you're gonna luv this.  I bought the Blue and I like it!

The casing on this unit is very cheap plastic.  It looks like it's going to scratch very easy, so I have to be careful with it.  The door that you open to put the battery in also seems very cheap and flimsy.I liked the idea of having a touch screen and more importantly, wifi.  The touch screen is not very good as other ratings has indicated.  It's not like a cell phone touch screen, it seems slow and outdated.  It's not too bad because you can use your fingernail and it works well that way.  The menu is complicated and takes some getting used to.  Everything is touch screen except for the review button, the picture taking button, the on/off button, zoom and switching it to auto mode, everything else is done via the touch screen, so if you're not a fan of touch screens, this is not the camera for you.The wifi works and I can directly post my pictures to facebook.  Again, it's not like transfering pictures from a cell phone, but works ok.  If this is the reason you're looking at this camera, you could always buy an eye-fi card which uses wifi to transfer images to your computer, that way you can make pretty much any camera transfer photos through your wifi connection.  Had I been able to try this camera before I bought it, I probably would have done this and bought a different camera.Overall, it's a decent camera and the price wasn't extremelly bad, but it's just not the quality that I'm used to seeing from Canon.

One thing to remember is these cameras are not for professionals, they are made so that your pictures come out.  You can get creative, but it really depends how much you want to learn about all it's features.PROS: I bought the ELPH 110 first, but returned it when I found out I could get the 320 for about the same price.  The camera is almost exactly the same, except the 320 has a really large display screen.  If you don't like touch screens, this is not for you. But after getting used to it, I found that I kinda like the touch screen.  The best part is that the mode settings are really easy to get to.  Compared to my Sony and Panasonic camera, this Canon's picture quality is WINNING!  Has lot's of features, really good bang for the buck.WIDE ANGLE lens!  Love this!  My apartment is rather small, so the wide angle lets me photograph in tight spaces.  VERY WINNING!Feels Great.  Canon cameras just feels great in my hands.  This one is heaver then the 110, but that's probably because of the large glass.  Comparred to my Nikon, this Canon is comfortable...and it doesn't look like I have arthritis when I hold it.I heard some people complain about the battery life...I think it is fine.  I never had it die on me while shooting yet...Plus it's rechargable...just recharge it!  Bang for the buck this camera is pretty nice.CONS:  Not really a big deal (but this is where I took off 1 Star)....When you are doing video, if you zoom in and out of the scene, you will hear the lens' gear.

For those who blame the camera for not connecting to your awesome home network, I would read the manual again for the camera on this subject, make sure you know how to operate your home network along with your computer. This is the same for any networked device anywhere, you have to understand just how to connect, how to open connections and know about security. It is not as simple as turning a computer on and going to facebook.  Second - Vivid images, decent 180p video, miniature effect is cool. Light weight, easy to use. Get a bag, extra batteries, wall charger and a SDHC class 10 card to make this camera last and shine for you when you need it.

Que drum roll...I took a few pics, touched the WIFI connection icon, and prepared to set up connecting to my desktop computer via a wireless connection. It found my wireless router, found my network, entered my network password, it found my computer, connected itself, and the CameraWindow magically opened. Then closed. With a cryptic message my camera had been disconnected. Well my camera was still on, so I repeated the process, and CameraWindow kept closing seconds after opening.I called tech support, and after trying numerous changes to my system that were already in place (file sharing turned on, latest Canon software), and being put on hold as \"Liam\" the tech support guy kept going to someone else at Canon for help. After an hour of this Liam gave up on me and said the problem was my fault and they really don't provide support to the Mac. Huh? He instructed me to go to an Apple Genius (as if I had them hanging in my closet on hangers just for my use). He asked if he could be of further assistance, I told him I was returning the Camera, and NO, you did not provide me any assistance as the problem wasn't solved.On a lark I went into my Firewall settings and unchecked the \"enable stealth mode\" setting: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Firewall options. Just for good measure I cleared out the settings on the camera, rebooted the computer, and started from scratch. Another half-hour gone.Clicked the wireless icon on the camera, waited, CameraWindow opened up and STAYED open. Hallelujah! I was so happy I wanted to call Liam and then remembered what a toad he had been on the phone and his dismissive nature. I re-enabled stealth mode just to make sure that was the problem, and CameraWindow closed again as before. I turned it back off, and wirelessly transferred my images to my computer.Then I tried the Facebook option. He sends the picture to Canon's image gateway, where you go and get a link to share on your Facebook wall. Are you kidding me. Then I tried connecting it to my smart phone. Downloaded the CameraWindow app, started it up, and connected the camera to my smart phone. Same thing. It simply places them in another picture album, and then you can \"share them.\" Ugh. Is nothing simple anymore? I thought I'd be able to take a picture, click the Facebook icon, write a post, and send it to my timeline. Just like I do on my smart phone, only the picture would be great and super high quality.So if you want a cumbersome touchscreen, plastic casing, lousy tech support, WIFI that's not really WIFI, and painful procedures to get anything done, get this product. If not, just get the Canon Elph 520. No WiFi, no touchscreen, slightly lower megapixels (what's up with that?), but 20x zoom. That will likely be my next camera.To me, it's simply easier to pop out the SD card, put it in an SD reader, and slip it into a USB port. Import into iPhoto and I'm done. And if you want to do the same thing with your smart phone, get the Lightning 5-in-1 Camera Connection Kit and Reader Adapter or something similar. Why Canon and other camera companies that sell WIFI cameras simply can't make the SD card appear on your desktop like an external drive is beyond understanding.For now, I'm just disgusted with the false advertising and the unprofessional behavior of their tech support. \"We don't really support the Mac.\" Fine, then you won't have my support either. That or take it off your frigging packaging! And stop making lousy software and design a way for the camera to integrate with Apple's highly superior iPhoto software (have it mount the SD card as an external drive and iPhoto will automatically launch). Canon's software is nothing more than a cheap port of their Window's software, which is no great shakes either.I simply don't understand why they can't make the SD card appear on you desktop like an external drive when connected by WIFI. Once that happens, iPhoto will open (if you have set it to do that) or you can treat it like a regular drive. Having a separate app to get your photos wirelessly is ridiculous. When I connect my Macbook to my Desktop wirelessly, it shows up on the desktop (Finder) as an icon. I can then transfer files, etc... When I insert the Canon SD card into my desktop's USB port, it shows up on the desktop like an external drive. This is NOT rocket science.Pictures are wonderful which is to be expected but all these other negatives make for a horrible experience with a company I used to respect a lot.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot ELPH 320 - OK for what it is", "Author": "Paul McAfee \"PaulMcAfee\"", "ReviewID": "R1J752E8LU6TIE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I left my compact digital camera in a taxi in Hanoi, Vietnam, and never saw it again.

I'm constantly accidentally changing settings or changing the mode.Also, at least in Auto mode, the delay between pushing the shutter button and taking a photo is so long that I miss many of the photos I'm trying to take.Despite the high pixel resolution, the images are not better than the 14 MP camera I left in the taxi.  I find I need to adjust almost every photo using PhotoShop to get a decent dynamic range.As a pocket-sized camera, this is OK, but it doesn't live up the expected quality, given its specifications.If you get it for a substantially discounted price, and if you are not a serious photographer, it will be a good deal.The camera does what I need while I'm teaching in Vietnam - to capture photos of my students and their projects for Facebook.

One-touch, images beamed at 802.11a/b/g speeds..  Awesome, right?Kindof like a super Eye-Fi?Well, no.  Canon failed to complete this feature.WiFi in the Canon is almost totally useless.  Let's count the ways:You might like to upload pictures to your PC.  I know I would.  Only, you can't.  The included \"CameraWindow DC 8\" software immediately EXITS if the camera is not connected by USB cable.  There is no WiFi support there.  DC must stand for \"Direct Connect\"?  Once configured for your WiFi AP, the camera will search pointlessly for a PC to connect to.  Finding none, it will discard your WiFi SSID & Password and warn you the battery is low, as WiFi seems to burn up a lot of power for nothing.  Recharge and start over.  I've searched Canon's site, but there is no (zero) downloadable software.  I've read the manual.  I've searched the menus, thinking surely I must have missed the \"upload all to PC\" option, but.. no.  Don't put away your USB cable, as it's the only way to get full-res pictures into your PC.You can connect to Canon's Gateway server over WiFi, and upload your pictures to Canon.  Registering for all three services/logins required (including registering your camera serial number, Canon Owner page, Gateway login, AP, etc) will set you back about an hour, but it's possible.  It works.  You can hand-select individual pictures on the camera to upload to their server, apparently at reduced resolution.  Hmm.The YouTube connection is even weirder -- you have to set it up on the PC, then transfer the configuration to the Camera to enable it.  Only, it doesn't work.  It's completely unable to log into my standard YouTube account.Email is configured the same way (on a PC), so you have to know the recipient email address in advance.  This seems to *totally* defeat the point of email-from-camera.  \"I'd send you this picture, straight from the camera WiFi, but I'm not at my PC where I can enter your email address.\"  And you pretty much have to step through your entire photo set, one at a time, to select a picture to email.  Don't think this is a trick way to get pictures uploaded to yourself, either.  They're reduced res, and you have to pick each one.Maybe you want to try uploading pictures to your iPad or iPod or iPhone so that they can be seen in iPhoto?  That would be a good compromise!  At least I could get my pictures into the computer without a cord, the long way.  You can connect to the iPad via ad-hoc network, slowly, and the iPad acts like a slow Gallery interface to look over your pictures.  No real-time viewfinder or anything, just flip-book.  Not bad.  Next I tried connecting to the iPad in the other mode for \"uploading\" pictures to the iPad.  This works!  Of course, you have to hand-select, on the camera, each and every picture you want to upload.  Did you take a few hundred?  Then this is going to drive you mad enough to go yank the SD card out of your camera.  There is no \"Select All\", no \"Upload everything\", no \"Sync new pictures\", just checkbox after checkbox in the tiny thumbnail view.  Do they beta test this?  With real people?  People that take more than nine pictures on vacation?All in all, it seems like they had some germ of a good idea including WiFi in the camera.  Unfortunately, they've made it just about as dysfunctional as possible while still claiming WiFi support.  It really doesn't do the one thing you would expect it to do: Transfer Your Pictures.If you're used to your Android phone camera connectivity, or your iPhone photo options, this Canon 320 HS is really going to smack you back into 2004.  Manual everything, twenty steps to do something, little or no useful feedback.  Crude prompts and menus.  And ultimately, no one-click or cloud anything.Like the other reviewer here, I ended up putting an Eye-Fi in my camera and wishing I had bought the cheaper Elph.The two stars is for taking good pictures.

Sorry amazon!  After reading how much everyone hates the touch screen I expected it to be a PITA. But it ain't too bad.  They could have done a little better job of formatting the menus and options.  It's hard to remember where you find specific settings, e.g. something that's buried several levels deep, but I find that true on every device I own that has menu driven settings.  Once you get over the menu learning curve you can take some really nice pictures which is a big part of why I went with Canon and this camera in particular.  It also takes pretty darn good movies for something that fits in your shirt pocket. The image stabilization seems to work very well on a video shot through the windshield of a car to keep the center of the image still while you can still see the dash bounce on every pothole. Overall it's a nice complement to my digital SLR and a lot easier to toss in the tourpak on my Harley for quick shots while riding.  The area where it falls a bit short is battery life, which is ,well, a bit short.  It came with a 680mah battery and I see there are better batteries, up to 1400mah that should last twice as long as the factory OEM.  I ordered 4 950's and I'll see how those work out.  At least I'll have spares.Update,  I ordered 4 NB11-l batteries that were supposed to be 950 mah, but when they arrived I was happy to see they were 1000's, so even better.  They seem to last quite a bit longer than the 680 Canon battery that came in the camera.  If I had seen the 1400mah's before I probably would have ordered them instead, but the ones I got were only $1.66 ea. so I have 4 spares at a price that is hard to beat. I also got the HDMI to mini HDMI cable so I can view the pics and movies on my 55\" TV. The clarity and quality of both movies and pictures is really amazing. I shot a movie in my kitchen looking out a window, when viewed on the TV it almost looked like there was a hole in the TV screen that went thru to my backyard. I do have a minor complaint when using the HDMI cable the camera screen is disabled and scrolling to the next picture requires swiping the camera screen, or running the slideshow.  For those who have problems with the touch screen, I have to wonder if they ran the calibration or if maybe they're trying to run the camera using their elbows, or their big toe.

Generally speaking, the camera works pretty well under most light conditions, better than expected in dark light conditions where flash is not an option, and the output is decent though video tends to be better than still photos once you get into darker or flaring light situations.  The wide angle lens does pick up a lot more in a photo than you expect, which is pretty great most of the time.But there are some definite issues with the design and interface.  The WiFi is pretty much useless - not sure why they included it other than to check off a marketing box.  The touchscreen can be laggy and mis-selects quite often, which is quite annoying when you need to flip the flash on and off to see if you can get the same shot better without it.  The light sensor gets confused by red and blue LED lighting - which can make taking band or night time outdoor shots an issue.  The program mode (vs auto) has a lot of features, but some combinations produce photos that look ok on the small LCD but turn out to be very distorted when viewed on a proper sized screen.And then there is the bane of my existence which has ruined hundreds of photos.  The macro mode will kick on and it is almost impossible, even with the camera powered off and powered back on, to convince the sensor you are not trying to take a macro photo.  The results are blurring and distortion of anything beyond five feet away - even when there is nothing in the foreground.  Who knows what the camera is focusing on?  Sometimes zooming in and out a bit fixes the problem, but usually I just end up shutting the camera off for a few minutes. :/Do get a large memory card with this camera.  I can fill most of a 32GB card before the battery dies during the day.  You can adjust the resolution of images to preserve space, but the camera produces fabulous high resolution shots when it's happy, so I prefer to get the best I can for the light conditions and then compress them as needed for emailing or posting to the web.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fun camera", "Author": "Andi C Bair", "ReviewID": "R1W725318HLTKC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon ELPH series constitutes light-weight, fun cameras, available in many colors, and focused on convenience. Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that I think many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the whole picture.The ELPH320 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 16 resolution (megapixels), and a x5 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CMOS-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.If you were to, say, take pictures of friends and family at an outdoor gathering, this camera is what you need. If you get ambitious, there will be stumbling blocks. Here is the camera's trait mix: It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 3200. That rating is lower than many others, but it is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 461,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The burst rate is a reasonable 2.9 frames persecond- great for quick shots. The weight of the camera is a convenient 145 grams.The main difference between the ELPH series starting 300s is the new Digic 5 processor. The ELPH 110, and 115 had Digic 4.Overall, nice, fun camera.

NO MATTER WHAT I TRIED, EVEN BOUGHT ANOTHER BATTERY, THE CAMERA HELD A CHARGE FOR 2 HOURS AT BEST.  SO KEEP A FEW BATTERIES WITH YOU IF YOU DECIDE TO BUY AND KEEP THIS MODEL.CANNOT HOLD A CHARGE__________________________________________I bought this camera as my SONY would never hold a charge and I am pretty sure that is why it was on sale at Radio Shack, but off course they NEVER told me that.  When I wanted to return it they refused stating it was on sale.  It was an ok camera.  I had an ELPH before, but when they first came out a million years ago and decided to try a newer model.So far so good, the color is really pretty and I really like that the touchscreen works well.  This is a great option.  But, I just got the camera, so I will check back in about a month or so to make sure it is as good as it seems to be so far.It has many option for you to use including a stabilizer so that your pix do not come out shaky or no focus.  What I also like is that it can detect a blink and will not take the pix if you have this option turned on, which is great for family pix, everyone looks great and has their eyes open.  It has good zoom capabilities and off course is 16.1MP, which does take great pictures as far as quality and even when you enlarge it does not get fuzzy.  IT has an auto setting and the camera adjusts automatically for a pix, or you can do this manually.  There are a lot of other options and too many to go through but you can read about them in the description.The price was a little high since this is an older model, but for $150 I think it is a \"good\" buy and not a \"great\" buy.  A \"great\" buy would be around $100 or at this price it should have come with a kit and a case.  I hope that I can add to the description after I post this one, if you do not see another from me by the end of June, 2013 that means I could not and this makes the camera a 50/50 chance to buy.Today is Tuesday, 04/16/2013, will check back in June and let you know how things are going with this camera.

Wheales", "ReviewID": "R1844UXH8PS2N1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a Canon EOS DSLR, which I lug around in a backpack carry case. This doesn't work so well for spur of the moment shots, and I sometimes leave it behind because of its size.  I don't have a smartphone, so unlike a lot of people, I don't have a camera at the ready at all times. Feeling like I am missing things,  I decided to get myself something compact that I could carry in my purse or briefcase for those must-have shots. I also knew I must have a Canon (I started out with an AE-1 in 1984, moved to the Rebel XT, and on up).After reading a lot of product reviews and making a comparative chart, I decided on the ELPH 300...but the Amazon merchant must have been out of stock, and sent me a ELPH 320HS, a newer model with wireless upload features, instead. There were also no instructions in the box.Rather than send back and start over, I gave it a trial run at a daytime performance of a church Passion play, and at an evening Easter-egg coloring session. I took shots with my DSLR and the ELPH-320 and compared.* I had some image shake/blur issues with the ELPH320 in tight zoom. Maybe I don't have the IS activated? Maybe I am used to a less-shaky camera.Because I don't have print directions and haven't consulted the online manual, I am unsure.  Pretty clear shots at wide zoom. I decided to take more wide shots and crop. The crops have had a bit of noise, but not too shabby.* The low-light feature didn't work as well as I expected in the low-light, tight zoom situations. I found that the \"auto\" setting took a brighter, higher light photo. I also found that the ELPH320 produced a lighter, brighter image than the EOS/DSLR indoors.* Also had trouble with the shutter lag, but only in extremely low-light.*Battery life is...well...short. I took 66 photos and a short video and played around with settings a bit and drained the battery. IN perspective, I would likely drain a phone if I did the same things. I may just get a second battery backup.With all that out of the way....* The face-focus/focus feature works wonderfully--it locates and frames the person/image you want to center on and stays with them as you re-orient your image. With the touch-screen photo option, you can choose the focal point. This allowed me to center an image on my son, while blurring out the background.* Takes crisp, up-close photos I took about three minutes of indoor video...and was impressed with the sharp video and audio.  Since the video button is right there on screen, it is easy to start and stop.* I am quite happy with the wide-angle. I haven't ever been able to take a wide-angle shot on my DSLR (because my day-to-day lens is a 28-105mm).* This camera has a touch screen...and reviewers complain about its lag, BUT I think that that is because they are used to much more responsive tablet and phone screens. The directions clearly state that you should touch firmly. You cannot \"tap\" on this screen and expect a response.* I tried the wireless send feature and it worked pretty well (sent to a laptop and wireless printer, but I had trouble getting to the PC. I prefer to just load into the PC because everything is backed up and I can pick and choose what I print, but I could see a definite perk to loading to a tablet or directly to a printer.All-in-all, I am happy with this as a grab-and-go camera.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good camera", "Author": "wgh713", "ReviewID": "R35D06L9R2Q23G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera so far but I haven't had a chance to really break it in.

Seriously?!", "Author": "Mazyar", "ReviewID": "RL5JPXVDJHNY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am just amazed at the amount of stupidity that has gone into designing this camera. For starters, I thought I was buying a Wi-Fi-enabled camera to save myself from the hassle of being in front of my pc to download the pictures. Well, that's not the case. Assuming that you have been able to connect this camera to your Wi-Fi network properly (and that's a whole other story), as you take pictures, rather than being downloaded automatically, you have to do the following steps EVERY TIME:1- Press the play bottom on the camera2- Press the Wi-Fi icon3- Press the PC icon4- Select your destination device5- Wait for the camera to search the network and find your device6- Go to the destination PC and click on OK to start the download (assuming that you have installed the Canon CameraWindow DC software that comes with this camera)There is a setting in the CameraWindow software to automatically start the download, but it doesn't make any differences in this process. Don't you think it's defeating the purpose of a Wi-Fi connection, if you are still required to be physically present in front of your destination PC and press a key? Can it get any more stupid?! Of course there are ways around it. You can change the program to launch when camera is connected through windows and set it for example, to download pictures to your cloud, etc, but I couldn't figure out any way to circumvent the steps 1-5 above, and keep the camera connected to the Wi-Fi when available. Compare this to any smart-phone built in the last 3-4 years which can easily be configured to share the pictures taken into your destination such as Dropbox folder, etc, without you doing anything... Just stupid!!Here is the other bizarre issue: A battery charger is included, which is for sure a nice feature when you have more than a battery to charge, but they dropped the very simple option of letting the camera charge via usb. Yes, you always have to have the charger, remove the battery, put it into the charger, wait for it to recharge and put it back. Compared that to the ease of just carrying a small usb cable and plugging it into your laptop or usb wall charger and taking care of charging. I can only guess that they had concerns with the heat generated during recharging if the battery is kept inside the camera, or maybe they thought the usb cable cannot provide enough amps, but I have 5 other cameras that seem to handle getting recharged via usb just fine with no issues... All I can say is that it's just poor design and laziness on part of Canon to take the simplest way for their design without thinking of the customers...Another issue is the touch screen - it's just a pain to work with. I have to tap several times for it to register a tap and it's just too difficult. I've try calibrating it to no avail... Another sign of faulty design and/or low quality componentsFinally, the camera has a very cheap, plastic feel to it... I was hugely disappointed the first moment I grabbed it with the cheap feel of it. It feels more like a cheap toy than a camera. I didn't expect much for a hundred bucks and some change, but there are much better qualities in the same price range if you look around... But this camera unfortunately is a huge failure.

Gehret \"G-Man  Colorado\"", "ReviewID": "R1PJ128UMX20BB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon Powershot Elph 320HS is a nice camera, there are some helpful tips for all users to be aware of...When playing back the video's there is a hidden icon for adjusting the speaker sound (when playing back through the actual camera) however the speaker is poor quality.  The Nikon S1200pj projection digital camera has the very BEST built in sound from its internal camera speaker.Canon made this model to be lighter than other similar models which have the 3.2 inch touchscreen LCD panel. Tip for getting the screen to be wide angle (fills the entire screen) is when you are in the function mode and then touch the icon for menu, there is a setting for 16:9 rather than 4:3 sizing . When switching the default from 4:3 screen for playback, this narrows the viewing size. By changing it to the wide angle (16:9 setting) this enables the user to see the entire screen.TIP for sound : When user has option to change sound for wind, this dulls sound when shooting videos.  When shooting outdoors with wind (and front microphones facing the wind) its better to turn your subject (when possible) against the wind that may amplify the wind sounds.  Or,  simply change the setting for wind when you are outdoors, but do not keep the setting to wind at all times because this will dull your sound and stereo capabilities.TIP for those who complain of difficult touch screen frustrations, first , know that this is not a capacitive screen and purposely Canon doesn't want accidental choices made by having too sensitive a screen.TIP for those who complain that there is a significant or disappointment in the shutter delay (when trying to capture a moment and they notice a delay when shooting) this is caused when the top of the camera is set to \"AUTO\" rather than \"Camera\" .  There is delay when shooting when the top switch is set to auto, rather than the icon of a camera. Simply keep the switch to the left , which will enable quick shots and capturing your subject.  Also, its important to depress half way on the shoot button (on top of camera) to allow the camera to focus, sort proper lighting and your other settings in advance of the actual shot.Over all, the Canon Elph 320 is a good compact digital camera which produces both good video's and stills.Some of the cameras were manufactured in China, while others were made in Japan.

There are videos on the Canon website, right on the page for this camera, and they explain the setup clearly. I especially like that I can upload directly to Facebook without linking to another device. That's something you don't get with eyefi cards or with the other camera I really researched, the Sony wx80. But then again, I don't have a smartphone, just WiFi devices. I still can connect to my Google Nexus though, with no problems. you can also upload straight to Facebook without saving pics to the Canon website, so your friends see the pic and not just a link to an album. I think I was able to upload in original resolution too, although there are resizing options too. It will work for you if you have home WiFi and you just want to share a few prize pictures. It's not set up in a practical way to auto save all of your pictures though. It would eat up your battery a lot anyway. But it works great for sharing the latest baby pic.No problems either with the touchscreen. I find it fairly intuitive compared to the combinations of buttons on my previous cameras. There is a stylus on the hand strap just in case, but I haven't needed to use it - even with a screen protector on it. I was able to rearrange the icons, and you can drag zoomed pics to see different areas like on an iPhone. It isn't the Apple experience in terms of icon appearance or gestures, but it definitely does work without frustrating me at all. I played around with the controls for an hour and I feel like I know where to find stuff better than in my Sony or the Konika Minolta I had before that.Now for pic quality, I'm still trying things out but it has good reviews on independent sites. I wish it had in-camera panoramic like the Sony wx80, and a higher iso, but my main goal was to be able to share pics without much fuss while taking quality shots, so I think I've found it.

It took beautiful photos on my trip, including some gorgeous sunset shots.I have no problem really with the touch screen, and found it much easier to navigate through the menus and find what I was looking for.  Yes, you do have to touch the screen with more pressure than your typical phone or Ipad, but this didn't bother me.The only downfall, as others have mentioned, is the rather short battery life.  But even with taking quite a few photos and making frequent use of zoom in/out and turning off and on, only one day did I start to get a low battery warning by the end of the port visit (about 10 hours later).  Thanks to all the warnings from other reviewers, I made sure to charge the battery every night before bed so it would be all set for the next day.  I could see how this may become a problem  though if you are in areas not easily accessible to charging your battery so frequently.  Having a backup would be a good idea.I still give the camera 5 stars for it's crisp, beautiful photos and ease of use.

In the past, I have owned cameras from many different brands and by far from my experience, Canon and Panasonic have always exceeded my expectations. I went with this camera after doing a lot of research and most of the times, the negative reviews were always about the touch screen which was actually the reason I was drawn to this one from the rest. I purchased the dark pinkish color because it was such an unique color for a camera. After using the camera for over a year, I can truly say that the touch screen is not a big deal at all. It doesn't lag and neither is it unresponsive. While the touch screen may not be as easy as the iPhone touchscreen, it is just as effective.I truly love the touch screen! It is very easy to go to the menu and display options. There is also a small button on the camera next to the touch screen where you can review the images fast and easily with one click. I absolutely love this camera because of the amazing photos it takes because that is what really matters, right? Well you won't regret buying this cameral. I have taken photos in pitch dark literally not knowing what i was taking photos, and with flash, it seemed liked I had sufficient light because the photos came out bright and clear. This cameras flash by far outperforms any other camera  thatI have ever owned, and I have owned many. I have to mention again how incredible the flash on this little thing is!!! I absolutely love it  and the capture speed is also amazing because it is fast!!. I also wanted to mention that this camera is small and lightweight to fit in pockets and clutches and purses.The only negative thing about this camera was the wifi, it was kinda slow to send the photos but the wifi wasn't really a buying point for me, so I didn't really mind its effectiveness. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this product. I have taken hundred of photos during my honeymoon that I have printed out and put on 16x20 canvases and you would think that these photos were professionally taken but they were taken by this camera. The small little details that really stand out when you blow a image on to a canvas can easily show impurities.

I mean it's okay but pretty useless. I was excited about it at first (the wifi) but once I started messing around with it, it wasn't what I expected. Just use it as a regular ol' camera and you'll be happy. Or save yourself some time and frustration and just buy an Elph 110. I hear it's pretty much the same exact camera but without the touch screen. I'm satisfied with this camera, just not with the wifi. I could care less about it. I just barley got this camera today though so if something amazing pops up I'll update this review.UPDATE! 09 - 08 - 12It's been about a week or so since I've had this camera. What I really dislike about this camera is the audio quality. It's TERRIBLE. Also, when you zoom in, it's as loud as a mother trucker so when you record a video you will definitely hear it. Don't know why but it just bugs me. By the way! Zoom is extremely slow when recording. My other elph camera was pretty fast when it came to zooming so this one disappoints me. I guess I'll just have to make it work until I can afford a better one.Update (again) 10 - 12 - 12After about a week since writing my first update I called customer service about the loud zooming noise and because I was still under warranty I sent my camera in. The person I was talking to said that the camera's zoom shouldn't have been sounding the way it did and they sent me a brand new one (or refurbished). The lens zooms in much faster than before.

In other words it will not connect directly with an Android tablet. It will also not connect to my Netgear N router which, in turn, will not allow any communication with my home network of three computers.  What a bummer!
