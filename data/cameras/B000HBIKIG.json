It is tiny but feels quite solid in the hand. The on-off mechanism (you flip the built in lens cover down and up) is undeniably cool, and the camera is very speedy both when you turn it on and from pic to pic. On paper it sounds like a great social situation/party ultracompact camera. Small enough to always have with you, ISO to 1000, optical image stabilization for shaky hands. Unfortunately the specs don't tell the whole story. In situations where there is plenty of light I think the T10 takes nice sharp pictures. However indoors you have 2 options: turn off the flash and increase the ISO - this often results in blurry, grainy pics above ISO 400 (the 800 and 1000 ISO settings are not very useful), OR use the flash and get washed-out faces with glowing demon eyes despite using the red-eye reduction mode. The flash is too bright and doesn't adjust it's output according to the situation.  The red-eye is a real problem as it is in every pic of a person or pet and very pronounced and hard to get rid of in post-processing. Another negative is the movie mode. It works OK in bright light, although I wasn't super impressed with the picture quality. However in dim light the camera doesn't increase increase its ISO and you can't use the flash during a movie, so many of my movies came out really grainy and dark-looking. You might think it a plus to be able to zoom during movie mode - but when you do this the camera keeps changing its focus, even on objects that are fairly still, so you get a disconcerting intermittent blurriness in your movies. Finally, I thought the battery life was MUCH shorter than Sony claims it to be.Since so many of my pictures are taken at night/indoors, I returned the camera and got a Fuji F31fd, which I am very happy with. The Fuji has very useful functions for me: face detection, which optimizes focus and exposure for faces even if they are not in the middle of the picture; usable high ISO settings; \"Intelligent Flash\" (the flash alters its output so you don't get the washed-out faces); and \"Natural plus Flash\" setting which takes 2 pictures in a row, one with and one without flash so you can choose which you like better.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "ok, i hate sony too. buy this camera anyways.", "Author": "Hawaiiensis", "ReviewID": "R1WXDW7C2WPY5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "sony is lame. i agree. they'e inexplicably expensive, provide terrible or non-existant customer service, produce equipment that has major faults, and only support their own proprietary formats and accessories so if you lose a cord or want to increase your memory card, you have to give them even more $.that said, this camera is amazing, and you should buy one.1. the small size of this camera makes it a non-decision as to whether to bring it with you, which is a major defect of most larger cameras. look at it this way: if you are not a photographer, you will likely never bring that big camera with you on simple outings, and will probably not even take it out of its case unless a really good photo op happens. so you will spend the same amount of $ on a much better camera that you will never really use. this camera fits in my shirt pocket, and comes everywhere with me.2. The \"magnifying glass\" mode on the sony t-series camera cannot be beat except with a much larger, more expensive SLR camera. believe me, i am a botanist and this camera takes such good pictures of flowers that you can see the grains of pollen, in relief. this camera can see better that you can.3. sony is not the only lame electronics manufacturer.", "Date": "November 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sony has perfected the art of the ultra-compact digital camera.", "Author": "R. Ryan Dacca", "ReviewID": "R1F1B6B4R12TZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've noticed a few reviews here mentioning problems that are either inherent in ultra-compact digital cameras or must be inaccurate. My first advise to anyone buying a digital camera is to really think about what the most likely circumstances will be when you'll want your camera with you. If you're looking only for excellent image quality, don't even bother with an ultra-compact camera, you will only be disappointed. If you want a camera that you can put in your pocket and take anywhere and can be used in a variety of different conditions, the Sony Cybershot DSC-T10 is an excellent choice.I think this is an excellent point-and-shoot camera. The form factor is perfect, it's about the same size as my (now defunct) RAZR cell phone, which means this camera is incredibly thin. You can slide the cover down and make simple adjustments like turning the flash off and take a picture with one hand if you need to, something you can't do with the T50 because of the touch screen. This camera is also thinner than the T50. I love the flip-down front on this camera, you aren't going to find a camera that will get from your pocket to taking a picture faster than this camera. This camera is also very well made, surprisingly so, in fact. It feels very solid and nothing on this camera looks or feels cheap or delicate in any way.I have had no problems with red-eye reduction on this camera as someone else has mentioned. The flash on this camera is very powerful, and if you're taking any close-up shots of people in dim lighting you'll probably want to change the flash to the lowest setting and make sure you have selected the red-eye reduction mode in the setup menu (it is turned off by default).There are a few \"issues\" with this camera. Picture quality suffers because of the internal lens, which is unavoidable in the ultra-compact cameras. You're just not going to get the quality optics you can in a standard lens design. There is quite a bit of noise in low-light pictures, but this camera can also take pictures at an equivalent of ISO 1000. The pictures are noisy, but the other cameras I've owned were not capable of capturing an image anywhere near the range of light conditions this camera can, so there's is a bit of a trade-off there, but I have to say the amount of noise in dim photos is noticeable on this camera compared to some others I have used. Probably the biggest issue with this camera is battery life. It's not terrible, but if you are going on a trip and planning on taking pictures all day without a recharge you'll have to buy an extra battery or you're out of luck.I got this camera to replace a Nikon Coolpix 5900 (5.1MP) digital camera. That camera takes better pictures in optimal light conditions than the T10 due mostly to better optics, but the T10 can take pictures in lower light conditions even though they are a bit noisy. This camera also has motion compensation which does have noticeable advantages, especially in low-light conditions. The size of this camera was a major factor for me. You can put the T10 in your pocket no problem and take it anywhere, anytime you want, which isn't really realistic with most other compact cameras, definitely not my previous one.I'm hesitant to give this camera 5 stars because there are some image quality issues and the battery life could be improved, but I really don't think there is a better overall ultra-compact digital camera on the market right now and I looked at just about all of them.", "Date": "December 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great pocket camera", "Author": "Dale Whitehead \"DDW\"", "ReviewID": "RQGJCMR3UFJIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this camera to replace my aging 3.2mp Canon Elph.

None of them match the Sony DSC-T10 when its comes to a balance of picture sharpness, ability to capture spontaneous moments, performance in low-light situations and size.  The S600 is by far the smallest camera I've used, and you could easily carry it in your pocket for excursions.  But for indoor shots past 20 feet, the S600 electronic stabilization was never good enough and generated terrible picture noise (graininess).  I always loved the picture quality from the DSC-W1, but it was too bulky to carry everywhere.  The Nikon 3100, like many older generation digitals, is only good for outdoor pictures and indoor posed close-ups.  I think most of us really just want a small camera that captures the bride walking up the aisle or your older sis getting her diploma or your friends jamming on the dance floor.  The T10, with its optical stabilizer, gets those shots when you want it, not 1 out of every 4 shots like many other digitals.  Its never going to rival a Canon Rebel for low light noise performance or overall picture quality because of its smaller sensor, but for something that can fit easily in your pocket, I've never seen a more practical go-everywhere camera.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Pictures, Fantastic Size", "Author": "Starfleet007", "ReviewID": "R293OJOQTYXJOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW, what a camera.  I just got this camera and I am in heaven.  I have been wanting a new ultra small camera that I could keep in my car all the time and even with me with very little effort.  I love the slide down cover which is great for protecting the lens.  I read many reviews on small cameras and which to get.  What sold me was the optical stabilization in this camera.  It will give you your best pictures versus getting a camera with digital stabilization.  Similar to getting a camera with optical zoom and not just digital only. This has an all metal body which is great for durability.  It has a battery that is designed to last up to 250 shots which is great for a battery this small.  The charger for the battery is compact and easy to store away or travel with.  I am going to get a new battery for a back up here at Amazon soon.  Don't get a non-Sony battery.  Spend the money and get quality.  If you are used to larger cameras, this camera will take some getting used to the handling of it.  I also have a 10x dx6490 kodak and its very big.  I got this because of the size.  3x optical zoom is perfect since I have a camera with a 10x.  The zoom sound is almost not noticable when using it.  Forget the Canon Elph models, this camera is amazing.  Another thing to mention which I looked at was the battery/memory door.  Its very durable and strong.  The Canon elphs doors are very flimsy.  You get in a hurry and those doors will snap right off.  It may be minor but I want a durable camera.  I spent a few weeks looking at many sites for the right camera and I found it.

Except that you can't use it at night!  There are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  Apparently these appear because the flash is SO close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  It's a known problem [...]Also, it's totally annoying that Sony uses all their proprietary technology.  As a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of USB??!!), and you have to buy a sony Memory Stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  On the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology.But other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.

Before deploying, I, like everyone else who's deployed in the last three years, made sure that I wouldnt be going without a camera. Knowing next to nothing about cameras, I just went down to Best Buy and looked at every one they had, I chose the T10 because of the fact that it was small, it turned on quickly, and I wouldnt have to wait four or five seconds after I pushed the button for the camera to actually take the picture, I figured a majority of my shots would be action scenes and/or snap shots.Once over seas my T10 has proved to be one of the most reliable pieces of equipment I have, I never leave the FOB without it. Its been dropped a few times (In a carrying case made by Lowepro), seen combat, has a sizable dent in the front, scratched all over, and undoubtedly has a pound of Iraqi dust inside, and it still works as well as the day I bought it a year ago. I dont know whats its specs are, I dont care, its been able to accomplish any task I throw at it and more. The picture quality looks great to me, photos are crisp and clear, even while taking the previously mentioned \"snap shots,\" with great lighting even without a flash; with a 2GB memory card I can hold 101 pictures. The videos play smoothly and clear with a microphone that pics up almost everything; with 2GB memory stick I can hold 93 minutes and six seconds worth of video. The controls and functions are very intuitive, Im just a dumb ol' Infantryman and I figured out how to use it without ever really reading the manual; every now and again I even stumble upon something new. Most functions can be done with one button on the back, that includes flash, timer, macro, zoom, last picture review, switching between review/picture/video mode, delete, birghtness, and screen display just to name the important ones. The battery life is very long, I normally go a week or so on one charge with normal use: 100 minutes charge time for pictures, 80 minutes of video time, and 150 minutes of review time. The most impressive thing though, in my opinion any way, is the T10s ability to take pictures quickly, all I have to do is slid the front cover down, less then a second later the camera is ready to go, I point and shoot, maybe one second goes by, on average, before the picture is captured; no other camera I looked at could compete with that performance.So, although some dont consider it the best art house camera, it is definatly something for the everyman. The price isnt low, but its not high either; its a small piece of electronic equipment, its going to be pricey, besides, you get what you pay for, and a year after buying it, I like to think that I've got my moneys worth.

I don't see this amazing technology Sony claims this camera possesses.**There's something wrong with the design of the camera and the flash being so close the the lens.  This results in large reflective circles appearing in some of your pictures for no apparent reason and it's impossible to repair the image once this has happened.  You never know when they will appear and it results in the picture being ruined. Sony acknowledges the problem but offers no solution. They claim it's due to \"dust particles in the air.\"**The next MAJOR problem is red eye. I have never experienced such terrible red eye problems on any camera. There is a red eye reduction setting which does ABSOLUTEY NOTHING.**The camera is cute and small, but the cord that comes with it to transfer pictures resembles an octopus.  Sony attempted to make an \"all-in-one\" cord for this camera, but ended up making a nuissance.  I like to carry the camera and cord in one small case so, if need be, I can transfer my pictures to a computer whenever I like.

This camera starts quickly, has image stabilization, and is easy to always have with me.  The macro mode is icing on the cake.  I looked for months for a good available light, found this model, and have enjoyed using one for six months.Having now used it for many more months, I'll add to the review.  I still really value the rapid start, quality of non-flash pictures.  And I've found the macro mode very helpful.

The selling point for her was the various colors it comes in, as well as the minute size.  It can easily fit in the palm of your hand.  As far as picture quality goes it takes amazing, clear pictures. Similiar to other digital cameras you can choose the quality of the pictures before you take them.  The interface is easy and the LCD screen to view your pictures is large and vibrant.  The only complaint I had was that the cover faceplate that goes over the lens only opens manually which is like my old 2 megapixel cam.

Then the battery has to be removed from the camera and inserted into the charger.  The charger is not heavy enough to remain in place on its own, so you have to weigh it down with something to keep in place, but, because of its design with the plug on the back, it doesn't lay flat on the table, so - good luck.The computer interface cable is a strange multi-headed cable with USB, phono plugs, and some other odd connector which may be for external DC power, although the manual does not bother to describe its purpose.  In order to use this cable (which plugs into the bottom of the camera), the camera itself must be laid on its front on a table (or its back, if you want to risk damaging the LCD screen).  But, because the front of the camera is not flat, the camera moves around if you just touch the cable.Other reviews attest to the inconvenient control buttons and the poor picture quality in low light conditions, so I won't repeat them here.I'm really disappointed with Sony on this one.
