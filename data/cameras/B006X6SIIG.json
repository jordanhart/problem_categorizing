I like it pretty well.  I Just learned how to use the zoom better.  It tells you how in the manual.  I paid $165 so this is a very good price.  It's easy to plug into the IMac to import the photos.  It's somewhat slim so it fits in my pocket.  It's a good camera.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$69.99", "Features": "GE E1680W 16 MP 8x Optical/6x Digital Zoom Camera General Features:\nSilver color with silver accents 16 megapixels effective\n16.5 megapixels image sensor (1/2.33-inch CCD) 3.0-inch TFT color LCD (230,400 pixels)\nElectronic Image stabilization Exif 2.2 (JPEG) still image files\nH.264, Audio G.711 (monaural) movie files", "Name": "GE E1680W 16MP 8x Optical 6x Digital Zoom Camera w HDMI Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517u9%2BzFmnL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006X6SIIG"}}
