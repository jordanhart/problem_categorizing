I was so pleased with the 310's performance since then, that for Christmas this year, 2009, I am buying one for my mom, who has never used a digital camera before.The first feature I like is the Image Stabilization- No more blurred iamges!!!The second feature I like is the camera menu and settings are very user friendly and easy to learn.The third feature I liked is when I accidently dropped mine into a lake in 9 feet of water- I thought for sure it was toast. But after taking it out of the water, pulling the batteries out, the memory card out, and letting it dry in the sun for a day, it still worked!!!!", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great customer service!!", "Author": "tree23", "ReviewID": "R3GS15JOCX92WX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My camera was shipped by the seller, and returned to them one week later damaged (something went wrong with the postage handler).  The seller rectified the situation by shipping a new camera to me overnight and providing a $20 credit.  Very good customer service.  As for the camera, I am very pleased with the pictures I've taken so far.  Good camera at a great price!", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Olympus FE-310 Red 8.0 Mp Digital Camera", "Author": "J.
