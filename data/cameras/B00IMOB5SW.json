{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nikon full frame flagship for a reason or six", "Author": "Tai X", "ReviewID": "R1SL61P0XMQH25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a hobbyist photographer and I have enjoyed shooting with the 36.3MP Nikon D800 since late 2012. What drew me to the D4S was the following:1. Fast Autofocus2. Ability to shoot 11 fps and keep subjects that are moving in focus3. Huge Buffer Capacity4. Exceptional Low light ability5. Better Auto White Balance than D8006. Improved Video Recording CapabilitiesOn the D800, the compressed NEF Raw picture files are generally around 45 MB each and when shooting in the high speed continuous mode, it takes 20 NEF Raw Compressed 14 bit pictures in about 5 seconds before it starts to significantly slow down while the buffer writes the pictures to the memory card.  The native ISO goes to 6400 and this camera has a built-in flash and an Autofocus Assist Lamp which can help in dark conditions.When the D4S is paired with the Sony S Series XQD 64GB Memory Card (up to 180 MB/s read/write speed), I was able to fire off 80 NEF Raw Compressed 14 bit pictures (about 20 MB file size each) in less than 8 seconds in the high speed mode before it starts to moderately slow down.  Though the camera does not have an Autofocus Assist Lamp, the native ISO goes to 25,600 which is 2 stops better than maximum native ISO of the D800.  The pictures I was taking at 25,600 looked surprisingly good in terms of lack of noise but keep in mind I am casually looking at these pictures through a hobbyist perspective.  When using the Auto White Balance mode indoors with the D800 when the lights are on, my pictures typically have a yellowish tint to them that can be corrected in post-processing or by selecting the right color temperature.  I took a picture with the D4S in the same conditions and the white balance looked correct and not yellowish.  The D4S is very quick to grab focus on the subjects you are pointing at even in minimal lighting, I am very impressed with its autofocus speed.There are 2 memory card slots, one for a Compact Flash (CF) card and one for an XQD card.  Memory cards and readers are not included with this camera so you will need to get these items if you don't have them already.  The Transcend 64GB Compact Flash card that I got cost about $140 and the card reader costs about $15.  The Sony 64GB XQD S-Series card cost over $300 and a card reader for that costs about $40.  I bought a screen protector for $15 as well.  This camera comes with a dual battery charger but you will have to spend about $150 if you want a spare Nikon battery.The grip feels pretty good and I will need to go on the Matt Smith workout program to strengthen my arms, shoulder, and back so I can carry this camera around with the NIkon 70-200mm f/2.8 zoom lens and a flash for prolonged periods of time.  The square shape of the camera pairs well with the 24-70mm f/2.8 and 16-35mm f/4 zoom lenses as well.  I especially like pairing it with the sub-100mm prime f/1.4 lenses because these lenses take full advantage of the camera's low light ability and they weigh less than the zooms I mentioned.The Canon EOS-1D X which was released in 2012 has a higher megapixel count, can shoot more frames per second, and has a higher maximum native ISO range and it also costs several hundred dollars more than this camera.  The Nikon D4S offers similar performance, weighs less, and has a much stronger battery so you can take more pictures under identical conditions.  I have not shot with the EOS-1D X but I imagine it is amazing as well.  I tried the video function out on the D4S and it looks very sharp but I don't really have much experience shooting videos at all.The ability of the Nikon D4S to focus quickly, to perform exceptionally well in low light, and shoot high quality pictures at fast speeds make this camera worth the price to me.  I will still use the D800 mainly as a walk-around camera and for day portraits and landscape shots because of its higher resolution.  For event and action photography, the D4S will be perfect and I look forward to putting this camera through the paces.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Everything a camera should be.", "Author": "Dave A. Whritenour \"Rocker4x\"", "ReviewID": "R2GG7CVN9RTZQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "From the remarkable ISO performance to the redesigned focus system, I find this camera to be worth every penny. One thing worth mentioning is that I went from the D3 to this, so I did not have the D4 to compare this to. From what I understand, the D4s may not be worth the upgrade for the D4 (although a lot of my D4 wielding pro friends have made the jump) but from the D3/D3s to this was a fantastic leap.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tweak to an already great camera", "Author": "M. Winchester", "ReviewID": "R1OSXI204VA5NG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I shoot with four different Nikon cameras, I find myself using the D4, and now the D4s, the most. I invested in the D4s for the subtle, but observable ISO performance improvement and to take advantage of the auto focus improvements/enhancements. To be sure, the D4 wasn't weak in either of these areas, but shooting in low light, with critters that like to move, or in good light with a lot of lens and often teleconverters, the D4s is just a great camera. After using AF Fine Tune to finesse my long primes and the combos using teleconverters, the D4s is the first camera I grab for, most of the time, depending on the light and how much magnification I need for the desired composition. I didn't need 11 fps compared to the 10fps of the D4, but with BIF, it may be helpful for getting that exactly optimum wing position, so I'll be glad to tap into it. With sports, or music, or dance, I'm sure this would be an excellent performer - and certainly would be my first choice.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect selfie cam!", "Author": "Zarius", "ReviewID": "R1MGD7FXLPY3YS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a basic camera for selfies and instagram photos, this was perfect!
