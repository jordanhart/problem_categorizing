Great quality picture (10.2 MP) for this price? oh yes! It's small, light and in like 3 steps you learn how to use the functions. The flaws I can find are that when you are going through the pictures you've taken there is a like a delay to see the defined picture and that when taking video the sound goes mute when zooming in or out. Still great performance for a regular person that wants to take family trips pictures.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for price", "Author": "T. LL", "ReviewID": "R195RNV99FLMNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a very expensive Sony DSC300 (the motor drive broke and Sony denied accountability).  This is very easy to use.  The functions are intuitive, the recovery is quick and the battery life is good.  I use this for taking pictures of my kids at their events, our dog, and vacation photos.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "great for the price", "Author": "Draydl", "ReviewID": "R12YJSR6IQ99M0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "easy to use for the technologically challenged!!! happy with picture quality!! only downside is instructional DVD is not compatible with MAC computers.", "Date": "December 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "uncle jessie", "ReviewID": "R3T710BM5KJK8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for several months now and I have no complaints at all.  I had one just like it before and I busted it against a metal fence and it didn't take a lot of force to do it so it's not a rough and tough camera.  However, it takes great pictures and is really easy to use.  One cord attaches the camera to the computer for downloading pictures, add a plug in to the same cord and it recharges the battery while still in the camera.  I bought the accessory bag with all the goodies for the camera which I strongly suggest, much cheaper than buying them individually and you will need most of it unless you already have it.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "average camera", "Author": "M. Hung", "ReviewID": "R2599KW986K9N6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just came back from 6 day trip to england, and half of the pictures are blurry.  Sure, if I were taking a still shot of outdoor pic, it come out nice.  But if I were indoors, or moving outdoors, pictures come out blurry.  So there's really no advantage compared to using a smart phone.  I think your money would be better spent on buying a better phone, or paying just slightly more for a camera with real image stabilization.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "MrLance", "ReviewID": "RBNQX5W2RE2L7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for our elementary school aged children. They love them and I was surprised that the quality of photos is comparable to my $250 Canon. I'm not one that worries too much about features --- I just like to take pictures and sometimes videos.  That said, my kids have found all sorts of odd things to do with it (why would you want to take a negative picture?). Ergonomics aren't the best but for the price and as gifts for my children, this was a great bargain.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10.2-megapixel effective recording\n3X optical zoom (3X digital/9X total zoom)\n2-1/2-Inch LCD screen\nDigital image stabilization\n35mm equivalent focal length: 35-105mm", "Name": "Samsung SL102 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.5 inch LCD (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MsmS4cRmL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001S0RU3G"}}
