{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Serious upgrade to home surveillance", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R1EX6A4JTUTE01", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been running a home surveillance system built of Axis cameras for several years and this takes it to an entirely new level.  First, this like all Axis products is top notch, packaged impeccably, clear instructions, a solid product, with lots of spares and all the tools you might need (okay not a drill, but there's a limit).  Installation was very straight forward - one suggestion (this goes for all IP cameras regardless), set up the camera first in your office or home, connect it to your network to get all the config stuff done while you can easily get to the camera if you need to do anything like reset it, then once that's all set up, go outside and install it, it will make your life much easier.After running the Cat5E cable to where I wanted the camera, installation took 30 mins (only so long because I was taking it deliberately slow to get it right (don't really want to be climbing ladders more than I need to).The camera has a LOT of flexibility to point the lens exactly where you want, it's all in the instructions.  Take care to not get dust or finger prints on the dome and in minutes you're up capturing 1080p or 3MP 30FPS images.  The resolution is incredible, as is the low light nighttime performance - turns out there's enough ambient IR from other sources to just about illuminate our property.If there is any possible downside to this camera, it's that it makes the other cameras crap by comparison - I'll be buying several more to replace lower resolution/performance cameras that are in use today.  While a bit more money than other models, the features and quality of imagery you get in all weather, all lighting, make this camera worth it for effective video surveillance.As a bonus piece of information, a company called NetCamViewer in the netherlands has a set of video monitoring SW products that work perfectly with all Axis cameras - you can stream 1-4 Axis views to your iPhone (among many other apps).  You cannot go wrong with Axis products and this is no exception.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004LY02RM"}}
