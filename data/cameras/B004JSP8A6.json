At first I was afraid I had made a mistake because of the bad reviews, but the pictures came out fairly well and so did the video mode.

I've also got a Canon S95, which I was just too scared of getting messed up when I take out with me or go underwater, even with the expensive underwater case. The xp20 isn't the best when it comes to shooting indoors.. actually I don't like the quality at all when the room is a bit dark, but outside with natural lighting and under the water it will do the job.  Just make sure the seals are all locked in place and I don't think it will be a problem. Other cameras that I have used usually require a big hunky underwater case which is actually a bit embarrassing to carry around, but that's another great thing about this camera.In a dark room, this camera isn't so great.

Experiment closing the door many times before taking it under water. I was even able to get a tiny click out of closing the battery door and it was not securely latched!

On my first usage in a river rafting event, I already see the problems with this camera:1) I am experienced with Camera and camcorders, I know how to hold them properly. But the lens head is placed in a very awkward place, your fingers will easily cover part of the lens head. So, don't be surprised to see your fingers in the final photos and video clips. It's almost for sure that you will not get photos or videos of yourself. Because other people may not be able to hold this camera properly to take yours.2) Hard to fine tune the zoom speed. Not convenient, but I can live with that.3) The camera won't focus while zooming (it will focus after zooming stops). This is a typical issue with non-DSLR camera in video mode. I saw the same thing in Panasonic camera also. Not a big issue to me.4) This is the biggest flaw, the audio is not in sync with the video. I have to turn off the audio from the video clips, and add background music when producing the final movie for the rafting trip. Even my simple Flip video camera handle this better than this Fuji camera.5) The video quality is no way to compare with regular HD camcorder. The image is kind of grainy, even at 1pm strong sunshine with good light. Again, I can accept this since I am in a condition (around water) where normal camcorder can not be used.6) Indoor photo quality is no way to compare with my 5-year-old 5MP Panasonic camera.But this is OK to me since I am in a condition (around water) where my normal camera can not be used.If this is the only camera you want to have, I won't recommend this.

I use the video setting to record my boyfriend's bands when they play (in clubs, theatres and bars).

This was somewhat of an impulse buy, as I had not researched the camera before purchase; got it at Costco. I was pretty psyched about the waterproof feature, since we spend a lot of time at the pool and in the water. I also liked the fact that it takes HD video. Once I got the camera home, I read the reviews about this camera not being waterproof enough, and I thought, \"oh those people probably did not read the directions about making sure the battery flap was securely shut.\" WRONG! The very first time I took this camera out into the water, I made double and triple sure the battery flap was securely closed and snapped tight. It took pictures for about 10 minutes and then boom, a red light started flashing and that was it. Dead camera. When we got back home, I opened the battery flap up and sure enough there was water in there. So now I have a dead camera.As to picture quality (pre-death of camera), the outdoor pictures were fine/average compared with my previous Cannon, but definitely not better, notwithstanding Fuji's 14MP where my old Cannon was like 8MP. The indoor pictures absolutely sucked, all the time, every time. I messed with the settings numerous times to try and improve the quality, but the flash and settings never could get it right. All the indoor pics look blurry, overly orange, and improperly flashed, no matter where I was indoors. The HD video was really the only redeeming quality of this camera; the video always turned out nice for us, although the mic was placed oddly so that a person's finger would be almost 100% guaranteed to cover it as they took video. Also, the lens placement has a tendency to get in the way of fingers.Overall, I regret buying this 100%. It was one hundred fifty dollars wasted.

Loren", "ReviewID": "RA43THYN2OAAN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just returned from Cozumel and used the Camera on the beach and underwater.  It worked fine without any problems. The pic quality was very good. Underwater movies were especially sharp.  The important issue with this camera is it is definitely mechanical and has potential flaws. And we have to be just as careful with this camera as we would be with one that is not \"waterproof, shockproof, and dustproof.\" This camera will likely break like most cameras if you drop it on concrete.  Fuji said it was tested being dropped on plywood. I'm figuring most of us will be near pool areas and plywood is not the typical flooring to drop this camera on. It should do great falling on grass or carpet.  This camera is definitely not shockproof, dustproof or waterproof. One might argue that it is \"resistant\" rather than proof.The main problem is with the battery flap door. Appearance and lock function appear marginal.First off I was having problems with closing the battery flap. Water needs to be removed from the body of the camera and around the battery door before opening the battery door. Any sand or dust that is near the lock mechanism may interfer with opening or closing the door.  Consider that sand/dust may get lodged in the locks and shutter, speaker, and battery seal and God knows what else and make the camera likely to fail.The underwater pics/movies were easy to take.  The underwater pics especially movies were fantastic.  It was very easy switching from single photo to movie mode.Fuji happened to mention deep into the CD manual that the battery door seal will need to be replaced every year. I guess the seal deteriorates and makes the camera less waterproof- and fails?  I wasn't anticipating this additional suprise expense/hassle. I called an authorized repair center they could not give me a cost for this and the Fuji offical consumer phone routing hell was nonfunctional and I was not able to speak to a person.Overall In the short two weeks I have had the camera, it worked very well.  However there are doubts set in my mind about the long term durability of this camera and Fuji support.  Support from Fuji seems mediocre.  I bought the camera from Costco and intend to return it.Finally I was attracted to this camera because of the simplicity of a single camera that can be used for snorkling.

It still works just as well as when I first purchased it!  I purchased a camera once before for under water usage, and it bombed out on me big time as soon as I used it in my pool.  When I purchased this camera, I put it to the test thinking that I would have to return it for breaking down on me as soon as I got it wet like the previous \"water proof\" and \"under water usage\" camera I purchased.  WRONG!!!  It really, really works under water, and it works fantastically!  In fact, the pictures are so clear under water that when I did not see the blur like the previous camera I was overwhelmed with disbelief.  The pictures were actually clear!  If this is not true for others who purchased this same camera, then I must have been fortunate to get one that was actually made correctly to do what was stated in the website.  Now I use it a lot for various other projects, and in spite of all the bumping and dropping it has gone through and thanks to the carrying case it comes with, it looks like it just came out of the box like the day I received it.  I highly, very highly, recommend this particular camera because it is not difficult to use; it is not bulky nor requires many accessories like those cameras I considered purchasing to get excellent shots; it has automated focus that I can turn on and off real easily.  There are times when I want to capture facial features when shooting pics of people I know or like, and this \"Smiley\" feature is apparently a new technology for me.  I have no clue how it is able to function so accurately.

This is a problem I have had with several other cameras and have replaced many because of it.I bought one for my pre -teen son. He has used it underwater many times and it works great. I have even used one in hot springs( not recommended in owners manual) and it worked great. Of course, use common sense, make sure all compartments are closed properly and pounding surf is probably not a good idea.
