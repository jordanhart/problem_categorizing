{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprisingly Awesome!!", "Author": "Robert C Coquia Jr", "ReviewID": "R1MUEMPOZMMQGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera cover for my Canon 60D from a friend's recommendation who had one his Canon T3i. When I saw his camera, I never knew something like this existed. I know they make silicone covers for just about every electronic gadget out there, but had yet to see it on a DSLR. At first I thought it was cheesy as do some of the silicone covers look out there, but when I felt it & saw how it was literally custom fit to the camera, I changed my mind. Many silicone covers fit a particular product, but have loose areas &/or slide off on certain parts of the electronic. This one fit like a glove. In addition, the cover didn't look like you were trying too hard to show the world, \"hey, check out my completely silicone covered camera!\" I guess the fact that it's black in color like the camera helped, but it doesn't give you that effect.The reason for my purchase on this, is that I bring my camera with me almost everywhere. If you care about your investment &/or are that person who likes to keep their gadget in pristine condition like day #1, then this is for you. I'm planning on travel abroad soon & want my camera body protected from the basic accidental bumps either I make or people & the world around me does. It doesn't protect your lens, but definitely the body. I will say that when I first got it, it took me a bit to get use to it as it makes the body a tad bit thicker & of course the feel. But once you do, you'll be glad you have it. Unfortunately the stock photo showing the cover does look cheesy & makes you wonder if it will even look good. IT DOES! It looks great!! If you read the other reviews (unfortunately only 3 thus far), they all have it for the same reason...added protection. I'm very careful with my gadgets & this will definitely give you that added level of comfort knowing your DSLR body is wrapped in it.", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "So glad I got this.", "Author": "Horsebits", "ReviewID": "R2BDMYI78NHQG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm so glad I got his for my camera. I had seen this cover available fir other models and was waiting for one to come out in my model. It finally did. My camera gets bumped around a lot as I wear it around my neck. When I bend over it tends to swing this way and that bumping thing. This cushy silicone cove has definitely saved it from these little bumps. The cover is molded to the shape of the camera, even over the buttons. It it not air tight or water tight as there are a number of openings for things like the lens and the back screen to flip out for taking movies. The good news is you don't have to remove the cover to use these camera functions. But sometimes the cover makes it slightly difficult to change lenses because it fits up close to that area. This cover is not what I would call skin tight, but it completely molds around the camera. It is like some of the \"gelly\" cell phone covers you can get for your phone.One negative is that although the camera function buttons are marked with indenting and symbols like on the camera itself, they are completely black, NOT painted in contrasting white, making it difficult to see what the button is without having to tip the camera and get up close to see the button. I guess you can't get paint to stick to the silicone. It does give it a sleek look. The silicone is very grippy. This makes it difficult to slide into my one backpack camera bag, but not my carry camera bag. It just depends on the design of the camera bag and how tight the fit is. Another thing is that lint sticks to the silicone--lint from the fabric in the camera bag, lint from your clothes when wearing it around your neck, pet hair if you are photographing animals. That is just the nature of the silicone product. The lint doesn't really wipe off, but you can blow it off with air or wipe with a lint free damp cloth.I could not live without this cover. It has paid for itself by protecting my camera from many bumps and dings. If you have to have direct feel of the camera and it's buttons against your hand, you may not appreciate this item. I'd rather keep my equipment safe and sacrifice a little direct contact.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fits excellent without battery grip", "Author": "Victor", "ReviewID": "R163XJ64EAQTXX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Easy to fit and easy to use, smooth, durable, the display protection is excellent, but doent work with battery grip", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works very well", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RR4ZGF94DJO8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a non-bulky protection case for my Canon 60D.  Didn't really want a holster, just something to protect it a bit while hiking.  This fits the bill.  It makes the back dial a little more difficult to access, but it's worth it.

Adds grip, non sliding, and protection to the camera. You have to get used to no labels on the camera where this cover is but once you know your camera it's fine. Very happy! One thing of note--when you have a flash on the hot shoe the flap from the skin that slides into the hot shoe receiver on the camera has to be folded up which kinda pushes the protective skin out and a little down into the view finder. Doesn't get in the way of seeing but bulges out. I could see this annoying some people but it was a non issue for me.

I only gave 3 stars because, it is a little difficult to attach or switch lenses while it is in place. The cover over the flash shoe is clumsy when trying to attach an external flash. All operating buttons/shutter covered and accessible, but I had difficulties in two areas: (1) because the entire Pro Skin is black, all the button function lettering also is black so unless you have all the function buttons memorized, it is nearly impossible to read the button functions especially in dim lighting situations and difficult to make adjustments quickly. (2) This may just apply to me, but I found it particularly troublesome when trying to push the shutter as I could not feel the actual pressure when attempting to lock focus when pressing the shutter button halfway. I will probably keep the item, using it only as a protective cover when packed in my bag while traveling, but will remove it when in the field and actually shooting (I might also keep it handy in case of rain or other inclement weather).", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect fit", "Author": "Cristina Munoz \"Mommy&Teacher;\"", "ReviewID": "R20QXLJC2NO51C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My camera had lost it's rubber protection.

It fits like a glove,  and has a great hand feel.  Much better than the camera alone.  Does not work a grip.  I had to trim little by little until the batteries would engage.  After cutting,  it does not fit as tight, but it is still a stellar product.  Get to know your camera buttons,  as it is hard to read the engraved words.  I feel that makes me more competent anyways.  My favorite feature is the camera model is hard to see,  and I think the skin makes your camera less appealing to a thief.

You have to pop off the lens, and remove the carrying (neck) cord to install it.  Has a large opening on the bottom to slide on.  Fits just right around the camera body.  I'm still learning the 60D camera buttons and this doesn make it a little more difficult to see what the image would be on the buttons, but probably not as big of a deal for someone familiar with their camera.
