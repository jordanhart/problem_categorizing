I also purchased a class 10 SD card. This allows for quick pictures taking especially on a moving subject in sports mode. The battery life isn't to bad. I use recharge batteries. The only problem I've notices is the blink detector. If the subject is looking down the camera detects a blink. I am sure there is a way to turn it off. It takes great pictures, quickly. It is worth the money even at the regular price.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rotates pictures and bulk uploads to Facebook", "Author": "Jonas_M", "ReviewID": "R11M9P9SNETOKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "~ The battery and memory chamber door broke on my Canon PowerShot SX 100 and the cost to repair was about $100.00.  I paid $70.00 for this camera from Wal-Mart. The Canon is about five years old, has more wheels, switches and setting than you can poke a stick at, does a good job of taking pictures, but requires a keen memory to remember all the settings.  Plus, it is a little too large to carry comfortably so I went looking for another camera.I am not a real fan of cell phone cameras, they lack the romance of the regular cameras.  I wanted a camera that used batteries and not a charger pack.  I also wanted it to be small and easy to handle unlike the bulky Canon.  I saw the Fujifilm at Wal-Mart and after a brief inspection I thought it would satisfy my requirements, and it certainly does.  Although the Canon has now been repaired, I prefer the Fujifilm because of its ease of operation and comfortable handling.I saw a review where the consumer claims the pictures cannot be rotated, nor bulk loaded to Facebook. With all due respect to the reviewer, he is absolutely incorrect, the Fujifilm will do those things easily.  You can rotate the picture on the camera, or upload the picture to the Fujifilm \"MyFinePix\" studio and rotate them by that means.  You can also connect to Facebook via a computer and send them in bulk to your photo albums at Facebook.  You can also create a album within the camera and keep your pictures there on a memory chip.  The camera is quite versatile.  Once you run the MyFinePix program from the CD a window will open asking you to get the update, do so because it contains some later software that enhances the experience.  Dramatically.You can make high quality videos and upload them directly to You Tube, or take them to the hard drive on your computer and send them from there.The little camera is a power house for its size and cost, most impressive from all aspects.There is an excellent instruction manual in PDF format (may I suggest Sumatra PDF Reader) available on the CD which comes with the camera.There are many setting on the camera, easy to locate and activate.  The \"Auto\" setting does a good job and the extra settings can be of great help under the correct conditions.I would say, \"Don't be put off by the low price, it is a very good camera!\"  Fuji has been in the camera business for many years and have hammered out most of the kinks.J.

I wanted a camera that used regular batteries as I've had issues with the rechargable cameras (namely, no charge when you needed to use the camera).  There aren't many cameras on the market now that use regular batteries.  This camera has a much faster shutter than my old one, which I liked, but imagine my surprise when I went to post pictures on Facebook and found that I can only post one picture at a time.  Another issue is that you can't rotate a picture.  Wish I had known that before we took all the pictures of my son with his first turkey with the camera vertical, and then found that we couldn't turn any of them. Fine for printing, but not for posting (one picture at a time).  Unfortunately by the time we found that out, the turkey had already been skinned.
