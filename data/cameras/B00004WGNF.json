Versatile and exceptionally easy to use", "Author": "C-Man \"Tech Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R4V20WMJ9T5OR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife.  She is a technophobe... To my amazement, she has taken to this camera as if she had been using it for years.  Being keen on doing my research, I found this camera to be rated number one EVERYWHERE I looked.  If you're looking for an easy to use camera that takes exceptional pictures (both on-sceen and in print), look no further - this is the one to get.  It works and looks just like a 35 millimeter camera, so anyone should have an easy time having fun with it.On of the greatest things about this camera is its picture quality.  For a 2 Megapixel camera it is superb and has tested to be better than some 3 Megapixel cameras.  One reservation my wife had was that she couldn't get photo quality prints with a digital camera (she loves to keep scrap books).  We tried Kodak's print@kodak service and were blown away!! The service allows you to upload your DC 280's digital pictures to Kodak's web site and they print and mail them to you.  Nobody that we showed the pictures to could tell that they were not from a 35 mm camera - crisp, clear and bright.  Pictures at print@kodak are $.49 for a 5x7 print.  About $.09 more than regular 35 mm film at the neighborhood photo lab.  Think about it though - when you go to the lab with 35 mm film, you might get 4-5 \"good\" pictures in a role of 24 and discard the rest... The cost for those \"good\" 35 mm pictures is actually a lot more than you might think!  With a digital camera, you know what you're getting when you pay for the prints.  Believe me when I say that you'll love everything about this camera.", "Date": "November 29, 2000"}, {"Title": "Kodak Wins", "Author": "Chris J. Crosby", "ReviewID": "R1YNR5YDVIHQ91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased a Kodak 3400 Digital Camera (same one as the DC280, casing, etc. slightly redesigned) and I was completely knocked out of my chair.  It all started when I obtained the camera and had to go in a rush.  Being the impatient geek that I am, I put the box in trunk and took it with me.  Once I was at my in-laws, I started taking some snap shots.  I was up and going in less than 5 minutes thanks to the quick start guide.  At that time I saw the picture come up on the LCD.  I have seen many LCD screens on many different brands and this one was by far the cleanest, and sharpest.  I have seen Olympus, Sony, Epson, etc. and this one knocked my socks off.  I hated the fact that I had to wait until I got home to load them on my computer so I just pulled out the video cable.  It's a standard 1/8th inch end/RCA jack on the other end.  I plugged it into the camera and the RCA jack on the television and I had a gorgeous slide show going on.  I saw so much detail and clarity that I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  The smallest red spots and drool spots showed up on my 11 month old's face, the color was beautiful.  Here's the real beauty of it.  The room I took all of these pictures in was almost completely dark, just a small light that is barely stronger than an average night light, stood in the corner.  With all that, here I am watching these slides go by looking wonderful on that low resolution TV.  That alone impressed me.  I felt like this thing put the crisp display of my DVD movies, other digital cameras, all to shame.  The real result happened when I got home.  I attached the USB cable to the computer and camera, installed the software, and was up and going.  I then wondering how to transfer the pictures.  I looked at the manual and low and behold, there was a camera icon in my drive list.  I opened windows explorer, went to the camera drive, and had a virtual drive (which is really the flash storage on the camera itself).  It was as easy as copying files from one directory to another, deleting is just as easy.  I then opened up a photo program and saw these pictures.  I almost fell out of my chair when I saw how crisp and clean this pictures looked.  I thought the TV looked good but when you get them on a nice high resolution monitor, nothing compares.  There was no pixelization, NOTHING at all was wrong.  The curves, color, EVERYTHING on the pictures was clean.  Even the backgrounds looked clear and sharp.  Anyway, that was quite a bit of rambling.  However, the point is that there is a reason Kodak has more awards than anyone else when it comes to picture quality.  Other vendors can offer you really good pictures and more features for your money, but if you pay a little more, you can have the best and sharpest pictures with all the same features.  If you get this camera, you will not be disappointed.  NOTE:  I haven't even tried the B&W features, the Sepia, or the effects yet at all!  Have fun if you go with this camera.", "Date": "October 25, 2000"}, {"Title": "You'll never need another roll of film again...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1FVUU416BDWOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been holding off on buying a digital camera for a while now, since  I've always been scared off by the price.  Well, I finally  \"caved\", and I can't believe how happy I am that I did.  I had  narrowed my choices down to Kodak brand cameras, and was going to purchase  the DC280 when I saw this one.  Apparently it's based off of that design,  and even though it cost a few dollars more, it seems well worth it.  The  USB interface is a breeze, and the camera has just enough cool/custom  features that I feel I can take some interesting shots without feeling  overwhelmed.  The picture quality is excellent, and I haven't noticed any  serious battery drain.  If you're thinking about buying a camera, I say  wait no longer!

I've seen other cameras, the more expensive Cannon Digital elf 2.1mp, for instance, and none comes close to the ease of use of the 3400's graphical user interface.  Taking pictures was easy, and getting them on the computer was even easier.  The software mounts the camera like it does a floppy drive, you just go into the drive and drag and drop them onto wherever you want.  The pictures, well, they were stunning to be modest.  It brought the highest detail and best color out of pictures that would of been horrible on any 35mm camera.  With the included card it can hold 35 of the standard size pics, which look beautiful on the 4x6 glossy photo sheets i purchased.

Overall, a good starter digital camera. The pictures are great, with color reproduction being its greatest strength. In addition, as many reviewers attest to, this camera is easy to set-up and use right out of the box. No problems with the software installation, although I quickly uninstalled the included Arcsoft PhotoImpression. Quirky interface and useability issues. The LCD is more than adequate, and unlike some reviewers, I actually had no issues with battery life. I got 40+ pics from the included alkalines and have been using rechargeables since then with well over 100 pics before recharge. Pretty much what I expected from a digital camera. The menu system is easy to navigate, but some settings that I use more often, such as resolution and compression, should have quick buttons on the camera to make switching back and forth easier.My biggest complaint is with the zoom. I knew what I was getting with the 2x zoom, and it has been a limitation at times. Wish it was a true 3x or greater mechanical zoom. In addition, the zoom settings are not variable like a true SLR. Also, as I get more used to the camera, I wish I had greater control over more manual settings.Thus my overall conclusion is that this is a good \"starter\" digital camera, although one could argue that $399 is a little pricey for your first digitial camera. What makes the price more justifiable to me was the quality of the highest resolution pictures. They are great, leaving only some camera features as limitations.Pros: Great color reproduction. High resolution pictures are excellent. Easy to set-up and use out of the box.Cons: Limited mechanical zoom (2x).

And what a great choice it turned out to be! The pictures come out with unbelievable quality, and the color is literally \"true to life\". It comes with an 8Mb flash card which can only hold about 50 standard size pictures (and believe me, standard size is all you'll want unless you want to examine something in microscopic detail later -- in which case best quality will fit 12 pictures).  I took out a 32Mb card from my PocketPC and plopped it into the camera -- providing room for 220 pictures.  I then spent the next couple of days taking pictures of literally everything indoors and out. Shot after shot, often with only 2 seconds gap between (an earlier reviewer mentions a 10 second gap between shots -- there's no such gap). I was absolutely AMAZED at the quality of the pictures I had taken.  I soon learnt that the thing that eats up the batteries is the LCD viewfinder, so I used it sparingly, making the most of the standard eye-glass viewfinder (which is just fine!).

The color saturation is picture perfect, and the camera settings allow for beautiful 8\" x 10\" prints.  I print quite frequently on an older Hp 880c but the pictures are outstanding.  The only negatives are the placement of the viewfinder and corrections to the manual.  Sometimes your nose smudges the screen when you're looking through the viewfinder.  As for the manual, they mistakenly printed it to include a \"beep\" setting.  There is no such setting and Kodak assured me that they were printing new manuals to correct their oversight.All in all this is an awesome camera, that sets up in minutes and is a snap to use.

This camera has surprised me over and over with its excellent quality shots and capabilities.  I have used it for nighttime and low-light shots with great results.  For static shots and portability, this camera is wonderful.  With the USB adapter and the provided software, hooking it up to the computer was simple.  With a photo quality printer, I've already started cranking out pictures for distribution to friends and family.  I could go on about how happy and pleased I have been with the quality and facilities of my DC3400, but that would take too much space. There are a few downsides though.  As with any camera, film or digital, that does automatic focusing and exposure settings, there is a bit of a lag when you try to take a shot, so response time can be a little slow for those \"surprise\" shots.  The time between photos, several seconds at least, is sometimes a bit annoying.  Also, it does tend to eat alkaline batteries.  Rechargable batteries (NiMH) work very well, except of course for the classic rechargable problem of draining when not in use (left out for several days).  My advice is to get a few sets of rechargables and make sure they are all charged up before you head out each day. High points: easy to use, high-quality photos, hook-up with the computer was a breeze (usb), low-light capable. Low points: eats batteries, lag between pictures and when you want to take 'quick' shots, minor difference between viewfinder and actual picture (correctable by either experience or use of capture mode)", "Date": "May 9, 2001"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier with this camera!", "Author": "C.

Price, feature and picture quality-wise, Kodak was always in the top of the list.  I took the plunge and got this model and have not been disappointed.

The included software CD is full of utilities for both MAC and PC.  The only one you really need to install is the mounting software (to transfer the photos) unless you want to input a photo directly to your hard drive or create your own picture borders.  The mounting software threw me a bit - I was expecting some fancy interface, but you basically just click through a couple of directories to get to your photos.  From there, you drag them to your application or double click to open them.  You delete them just as you would any files on your computer.  The other software features (formatting, controls etc...) are accessible by using the right mouse button.The only thing I had to get used to was that the power button does not slide \"on\" and stay put - you have to slide and hold it for a few seconds to turn the camera on or off.  And the photo button has 2 distinct positions - focusing (like when you lightly depress the button before shooting on a regular camera) and taking the picture.  I did a lot of focusing thinking I was taking pictures - you really have to press down on the button to take the picture.

Beging a complete novice at photography, I asked some \"professionals\" which camera would best fit my needs.  I was told to look at the Canon line of products, specifically the ELPH S100.  Considering that I need a bigger memory card I decided to look for something a bit cheaper.  In the end I found the Kodak DC3400.Camera Qualities: Firstly, the camera is large and heavier than some of the non-digital camera's I've used.  It includes an LCD screen for viewing the pictures and menu options.  The menu is easy to use and self-explanatory.  I haven't burned through my first set of batteries yet (at this point, I've had it for a 5 days).  I am following the instructions and leaving the LCD screen off while I take the shots.Photo Quality: I am amazed at the photo quality with the DC3400.  A few times though, I have found the pics to be a little darker than usual (probably owing to the flash's quality).  I've used Adobe's Photoshop to fix the pics up.  There are several settings, such as photo quality and sharpness, that can be adjusted to create the right type of pictures.Software Add-on: The software leaves much to be desired.  Once installed, I began rummaging around to get a feeling on how to use the software to download the pictures from the camera.  I've had difficulties learning how to download my pics and have begun using Windows Explorer to do the job.  I highly recommend getting a third-party software application to edit the photos.I've definitely started taking more pictures with the DC3400.  It's a very easy camera to 'point and shoot.'

It amazed me the first day, when I was able to take 50 low-res shots of a show put on by my friends, nearly all of which came out well. By contrast, my Canon EOS 3000 produced no salvageable shots at all. I was able to play back a slide show to my friends the next day, and they were really thrilled.  Even in low light, no flash conditions, most shots were unblurred. My only reservation came when I tried a Sandisk card reader, but the downloaded images put back into the reader, could not be read by the camera (to give slide shows from edited photos, e.g.). It turns out that all Kodak cameras have individual JPEG settings, and can only read images made by that camera.  Nor could I find a way to send photos out into other programs, so I always have to download twice, to have access to images for other purposes (e.g. card reader access). I ended up swapping the card reader for a 16MB CF card, so I could keep special photos for a while, and still use the camera. My only other criticism is that in bright winter slanting sunlight, the automatic exposure often makes an overbright picture - I am sure practice will help me sort this out. When exposure is just right (which is about 50% at present) the pictures are fabulous, and truly make the equivalent Sony look poor by comparison colorwise.

Countless hours of scouring every Digicam site on the web provided no conclusive choice for me.  So, on a whim, I bought this camera because I found it for a great price. I made the right decision.  I have been more than satisfied with this cameras performance.  The color is outstanding, and the resolution is more than adequate for my needs.  I can print out 8 x 10's that are virtually indistinguishable from actual photographs despite the fact that I have read that this is only possible with a 3 megapixel resolution. I really enjoy using the camera, it is quite easy to use, very intuitive, yet it still allows for some amount of manual control.  I have taken probably four hundred pictures with the camera, and every week I find myself carrying it around with me in hopes of taking more.  There are a couple of drawbacks to this camera, however.  I found the low lighting capablities of the camera to be poor.  I simply cannot take good pictures with a decent source of light.  Also, the 2x zoom doesn't provide me with the range that I often desire.  Kodak also chose not to include a Nimh batteries and a charger, which were standard with the 280. Despite these issues, this camera will please anyone who doesn't want or need a professional, more manual digicam, but does want great output.

These last for a very long time with regular use and last about 15 minutes with the LCD viewfinder.  Next is the picture quality.

I used this when  I took almost 80 pics after a farewell party and everybody just  loved it.- Tons of options to enhance your pics (add a border, exposure  adjustment, white balance)- Internal memory that allows me to take 3 rapid shots. Better  than nothing.- Battery is OK, not great though. I took around 120 pics with  LCD + connect to TV for presentation and the battery still  alive (in a very critical condition).- With full battery, you can turn on LCD for a little more than  10 mins.THUMBS DOWN:- Zoom is a little noisy.- LCD is more pixelate and has a slow refresh rate (around 15fps)- Software is really bad!!! Doesn't work with my comp (Celeron  1.1Ghz, W2K, 768RAM). I used a CF reader.Summary:I don't have to read the manual to use it. Get an NIMH battery, and you are set to go.

The camera is very easy to use and takes very nice pics. It has nice options like Sepia mode(gives the photo a old fashion look like brown tone) and B&W; mode. I bought a 32mb memory card a few days later - the 8mb it came with will hold about 25 pics on middle resolution and with the 32mb card it will hold about 77 pics at the same resolution.I would say the only negative things about this camera are the ready-to-shoottime after turning it on is about 5 or 6 seconds mainly due to extending the lens out and it takes about the same time to store pics in the memory card after each shot- but then again how often do you need to take rapid fire shots anyway!Oh yeah one more thing is that I highly recommend buying an HP Photosmart printer - they have a memory card slot built in so you can bypass your computer if you want or you can download the pics into your computer that way also.

They break easily...especially if you happen to put the batteries in backwards and try to force the door close as my grandkids attempted. The other problem is the 'flash'. I'm not sure if it is the flash strobe or the flash capacitor that goes bad....but either way...the flash stops working. At first it's only a missing flash here and there...then complete failure...which makes me believe it is the capacitor going bad.

After numerous lengthy conversations with several Kodak representatives (most of whom insisted I must be putting dead batteries into the camera, that there couldnt be a problem with the camera itself), I was provided with a replacement camera...which failed right out of the box. The manual says the camera will operate with a \"variety of AA Batteries\", but this was not the case in my situation. I am disappointed with the camera, and the company.
