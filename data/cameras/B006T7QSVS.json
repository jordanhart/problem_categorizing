{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fujifilm HS-30 EXR", "Author": "Michael T. McCaffrey \"sumofan\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZTRM7D09Q1TF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PREFACE:  This review is primarily intended for Point & Shoot types. I do not delve into MANUAL adjustments, nor do I have any interest in that. I want something that will take good pics without undue hassle and is convenient to take on travel.Well, after a fairly long wait for Fujifilm to release the HS-30, mine arrived this afternoon. I charged the li-on battery (no more four AAs) and took it outside to take around ten test shots. They turned out perfectly. I had the HS-10 ... then HS-20 before this latest incarnation, and really liked both cameras. I've no doubts I'll like this one at least, if not more, than the previous HS-20. You can read all the specs, etc., so I won't get into that. Physically, the electronic viewfinder and LCD are sharp, clear, and bright -  and I do detect that slight shortening of the flash unit, which protruded a bit annoyingly on the HS-20. Thus, no problem at all focusing with the manual lens (which I love). I also did not detect the lag one experienced between shots with the HS-20. Now, again, I just received the thing and only took some ten shots ... but I was very happy with the shots. Since mine is the first review, it remains to be seen if problems, such as the overheating warning with the past early editions of the HS-20 produced, will come along as others get their cameras and put them to use. I hope to get out there tomorrow and run this thing through its paces. If anything untoward happens, I will certainly advise. The HS-30, like the HS-20, sure beats the heck out of having to stop to change cumbersome lenses for differing shots/scenes! Additionally, it all fits into a nice/compact Case Logic case, no more lugging around all that other \"stuff\" in backpacks, etc.  :-)  In closing, my background is strictly amateur photography. I've no aspirations in becoming a pro. The pics I take are for my own enjoyment, and it ends there. Speaking only for myself, I do believe photography should be fun, not a hassle. I've had the Canon 7D and the 60D, with all the \"L\" lenses, so I do \"know my way around the block\" a bit. This is not to say I think this bridge camera takes the place of DSLRs for professional use, certainly not. Enjoy your HS-30, and please do post your experiences so we can all benefit.  :-)ADDED:  March 15, 2012:  Took the camera out to my favorite park and ran it through its paces. There was a slight ... slight ... delay between some shots at the park, but no delay when taking pics indoors and other environments. Not a problem for me.  I took 52 pictures, and except for two, they were absolutely perfect, and those two were probably my fault. The zoom works fine, no problems. The LCD is also excellent, though I prefer taking my shots via the viewfinder. Lastly:  I am a huge fan of POST PROCESSING any pictures I take, be it with a DSLR or the HS-30. I have a MAC and use APERTURE 3, and Aperture 3 makes a notable difference in getting pictures to look the way I want them (that \"finishing touch\"). If you're using a Windows machine, you might want to look into software packages designed to work with digital pictures.SUMMATION:  Realizing this camera is NOT a DSLR, I would buy it again in a heartbeat. It felt so nice to walk around the park this morning without lugging along a bag filled with heavy lenses. And the resulting pictures more than satisfy me.ADDED:  3-20:  Having had this camera since last week, and having taken a lot of shots with it, I can say I take nothing back: it was worth buying. I am speaking strictly from a Point & Shoot perspective here. If one is looking for all the bells and whistles of a DSLR, then get a DSLR, or you're probably gonna be frustrated. Reiterating: though quite advanced for a P&S;, this camera, in the end, is NOT a DSLR.ADDED/CONCLUSION: 5-2-12: I've now had the HS-30 for about 1.5 months and have used it extensively. I even took it on the annual trek to Las Vegas a bit over a week ago, and it performed flawlessly. If anything, I would draw the prospective buyer's attention to ACTION photography. I would NOT expect this to behave like a DSLR in this respect, OK? You CAN get a sequence using CONTINUOUS MODE, but I found using a DSLR in this respect (action shots of moving subjects) much more satisfying. Taking shots of static objects however, this camera has worked excellently. I note the price keeps dropping on what they were asking initially for the camera. I think it's a great bargain if you're in the market for a great Point and Shoot camera.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "A winner for me!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R9CE7QVHB9MT5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I want to compliment Amazon on the free shipping. I ordered the HS30 on April 9th and received it on April 14th. Two to five days before the estimated time it was supposed to arrive. ( between 16th and 19th ) Very pleased with that Amazon.So far I think the HS30 is great! The IQ is not bad at all. I have a Nikon d3100 which takes great pictures but sometimes I would miss a great shot because I didn't have the right lens on at the time. I took a closeup pic of a Finch on my porch railing yesterday that I never would have gotten with my Nikon, I'm sure, because I would have had to change lenses. The pic came out excellent! Crisp, sharp and detailed. Took a great pic of a quarter-moon this morning. Again, crisp, sharp, and closeup. Now, is every pic like that? No. But, neither is every pic taken with a $5,000 camera.Take time to go through the menus and learn the camera, and you should be fine. I mainly wanted the long lens and the panorama feature. So far so good. What persuaded me to buy this camera was I had previously owned the HS10 but had to return it for financial reasons, not because I didn't like it. When looking back at some of the pictures I had taken with it, which were pretty good, (not my photography skills but the camera IQ) and now being a little more experienced with shutter speed and aperture settings and such, I figured this time around I could really work some magic with it.Also, a nice surprise was that from the back it looks almost exactly like the D3100. So far, all of my macro shots have been really good too. Really good! Some hand-held telephoto ( at full zoom ) shots were a bit shaky but if you can use a tripod with remote or self-timer you should be good to go. The low-light shooting modes work pretty good too. IS works good.If you want a camera that you can take a picture, \"now\" without fumbling with a bunch of lenses and stuff and still get nice images, this should do the trick. Plus, there are a lot of different settings and so forth to play with. The 360 panorama works great. ( might need to practice a little ) The software has a 360 viewer which is pretty cool.Recommend as a nice carry around, all purpose, trip taking camera.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "It didn't work for me, but it might work very well for others.", "Author": "John Sturgeon", "ReviewID": "RAZ9B2CQP86B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "With high expectations the Fujifilm HS30 arrived yesterday on it's first day of release.  I tested it out yesterday afternoon. Today it went back to Amazon.  To be specific, the actual performance of the camera did not match everything the official spec sheet said it would do.  And there were a few other problems with it, too.Part 1 - THERE IS A LIMIT ON THE ISO / SHUTTER SPEED.Those of you who may have seen my Amazon post on the Canon SX40 will know that over the last five months and 22 pages of Comments and replies I have criticized Canon heavily for putting an unnecessary restriction on its ISO (The old-fashioned term for this was \"film speed\").  If you want to do low-light photography you have to be able to use a higher ISO and a slower shutter speed. That is the way it has always been for all types of cameras.Canon had placed a new, arbitrary limit of ISO 100 on the camera (which was not on its previous model, the SX30) together with maintaining its maximum 15-second shutter speed limit. This stopped me, briefly, from doing my long-standing, nighttime photography of Monterey Bay Harbor, which sometimes required an ISO 400 with a 15-second shutter speed. There was no way for the user to bypass this limit even in Full Manual Mode.The new Fujifilm HS30 has a similar limit, though it is not nearly as severe. To be fair, this limit on the HS30  is so slight that most people will probably never notice it at all.  But for those of you who may be effected by this ISO and Shutter speed limit, here it is.The Website makes no mention of it.  Download the .pdf file for the full User Manual for the HS30, and you will see only this small notation repeated both on pages 33 and 34.\"The shutter speed is restricted depending on the ISO setting.\"How much is it restricted?  The user manual does not say. I called Fujifilm tech support, and they didn't even know for sure.  So I tested the camera myself, and here is the ISO / shutter speed limit, exactly:ISO....100 = 30 second shutter speed limitISO....200 = 15 second shutter speed limitISO....400 = 8 second shutter speed limitISO....800 = 4 second shutter speed limitISO..1600 = 2 second shutter speed limitISO..3200 = 1 second shutter speed limitAlthough all of the publicity says that you can use shutter speeds \"from 30 seconds through 1 / 3200 of a second,\" that is not quite literally true. You can only do that at ISO 100. If you try to do that at ISO 200, then the shutter speed limit is cut in half to 15 seconds.  At ISO 400 it is cut in half again to 8 seconds, and so on.Those of you who want a graphic example of what a limit on ISO means may wish to view my video I posted for the Canon SX40 here on Amazon.  At ISO 400 with a 15-second shutter speed there are some beautiful nighttime colors reflected from the light of Monterey Bay Harbor.  At ISO 100 with a 15-second shutter speed limit the picture is almost entirely dark.  The limit on the Fujifilm HS30 at ISO 400 is only 8 seconds, very close, but not quite enough for what I personally need.  If that effects you, fine, now you are aware of it. If not, then that's fine too. In which case please simply just ignore this whole part of my post as completely irrelevant to you personally.But be aware that in some modes on the HS30 you cannot use a shutter speed of longer than one quarter of a second.  That really isn't very much to work with if you are trying to do any time-exposure photography with this camera, especially nighttime long-exposures.  So at least now you know.Part 2 - THERE ARE A FEW OTHER PROBLEMS WITH IT, TOO.Shooting in low light at dim targets in the distance is like shooting blind in the dark if you cannot see what you are shooting at.  While the Fujifilm HS30 does have \"live view\" on the LCD, it does not have an \"exposure\" live view.*  Live view means you see on the LCD exactly what the camera sees. \"Exposure\" live view means you see on the LCD what the final picture will look like (how light or dark it will be) before you actually take the shot.  The LCD lightens and darkens as you adjust the dial.  Canon cameras do that. Fujifilm and Nikon cameras apparently do not.  (If I am wrong about this, however, then someone please correct this information for the benefit of everyone else reading this post.  Thank you.)* Technically called \"exposure simulation live preview\" or \"exposure priority display.\"Trying to line up on a distant target in low light is fairly easy with an exposure live view LCD, since it lightens as the exposure setting increases.  If you want high definition in the shadows you simply raise the exposure.  If you want high definition in clouds, then you lower the exposure.  Combine the two images in Photoshop and you get an HDR photo (High Dynamic Range) with well defined clouds together with bright colors even in the shadows.  With the Fujifilm HS30 you have to guess ahead of time, take the shot and then look at the results afterwards to see if you got it right. On a camera with an \"exposure\" live view you already know fairly closely ahead of time what the result will be. I personally consider \"exposure live view\" superior to simply \"live view\" on the LCD of a camera, because it is simply more intuitive when you look at the LCD and see it for yourself.  It is especially important when shooting in low-light conditions since it makes it much easier just to find the actual shooting target, and is also very helpful for doing your own HDR photographs to finish yourself in Photoshop since with HDR you have to deliberately make some portion of each photo look lighter or darker in order to combine two opposites, but the judgment question will be, by how much exposure on each one?The Red Craftsman Toolbox Test.  The first poster here noted that there was some washout in the colors with his Fujifilm HS30, and I noticed a similar effect, but for me it depended on the angle of the light source. Here's how to test it for yourself.  Take an American-Flag-Red Craftsman toolbox and place it near an open window.  When I photographed it from the side, the color was accurate.  When I faced the window and shot directly toward the light source, the colors washed out considerably, and I noticed that the toolbox had shifted to a distinctive orange-red color.  A parallel test with a small Canon point-and-shoot camera (the SX150) showed no color washout and no similar color shift.  Photoshop can easily adjust for this, as the first poster noted, and the HS30 photos would have required that adjustment to them, but only to the ones where the camera was pointed directly toward the light source.Focussing Problems and Image Stabilization Problems. I had heard stories about focussing problems and image stabilization problems with Fujifilm cameras, and they all turned out to be true.  I shot from a tripod, from a makeshift beanbag rest (my Filson jacket rolled up) and also from a freestanding position.  The tripod shots did much better than the others by far, especially for image stabilization, but some of the others did not do very well at all, especially at much lower speeds of around one quarter of a second.  With the bean bag there was some double imaging with the HS30 (which did not show up with the little Canon SX150 by comparison.) Higher shutter speeds obviously worked much better for image stabilization, but in a variety of outdoor and indoor settings I used during the afternoon of that day I just could not get the camera to focus consistently at all. Even some of the well-stabilized shots were still slightly out of focus. To be fair, the shots that were in focus were much better photos on the Fujifilm HS30. No doubt about it.  Some of them were truly outstanding.  But also to be honest about it, less than half of all the shots I took were very clearly in focus at all, using both manual focus and auto focus. I just couldn't seem to get it quite right.I have heard that people who know how to adjust the focus well on a Fujifilm camera can work around this with much better results than I got. I certainly hope that is true.  And the little Canon SX150 is simply no match for the Fujifilm HS30 when it is focussing well.  A few of the shots with the HS30 were truly extraordinary. But I can see that learning how to focus the HS30 well and under a variety of different conditions might take some considerable practice before it was fully mastered.In the end I decided it was just more practice than I wanted to undertake. The Fujifilm HS30 camera simply does not work well for me for doing low-light, time-exposure photography, both because of the limits on the ISO and shutter speeds, and because of the lack of an \"exposure\" live view on the LCD.  Since that is my main interest, I decided to return it to Amazon.If you have different interests, then the Fujifilm HS30 camera might turn out to be one of the best Bridge cameras you have ever owned in your life.  It certainly has all the potential to be just that. I really do hope there are others who can benefit from this camera better than I did.In either case at least you now have the best information about it that I can provide you from my own limited experience with it.  I hope it was of help to you in eventually making your own decision about which camera to buy.  Whatever you decide, it should be what you decide that you like best, not what I or anyone else tells you that you ought to prefer, because each of us has our own reasons for preferring one camera over another.Best wishes to all,  John", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "A worthy replacement", "Author": "Joms \"Joms\"", "ReviewID": "R2CD0ASAY73ATY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will make this review as simple as possible. I will state the pros and cons of this camera over my previous HS10 and SX40 cameras.PROS- Better IQ, Dynamic Range.- Smoother manual zoom and manual focus ring.- Improved placement of built-in Flash- Much faster AF.- Much faster STS times, write times(especially on RAW+JPEG), shorter lag.- Much better EVF and LCD.- Real-time Intelligent zoom is now available unlike before where it shows useless box in HS10. Saves you time from cropping and interpolating.- Intelligent sharpness seems to work well under certain conditions especially when pictures are pixel-peep.- Longer battery life- Cheaper. I don't know why in the hell HS10 is expensive than HS30. (Hello sellers knock your head off).- Manual focus is still PITA to use but better than HS10.- A lot better in video both in AF(faster and hunting is very minimal) and zooming. Snapshot while recording is nifty feature too.CONS- This is subjective but I find HS10 color better. With a little tweaking, you can get similar color reproduction in HS30 or HS20.- Live-view is still not accurate on Manual and S-Mode.- Manual focus is still PITA to use but better than HS10.Compared to SX40PROS- Similar IQ- Manual zoom (You can zoom-in and shoot 3+ seconds faster than any motorized zoom camera).- Better ergonomics and handling- Better and has more magnification in Macro.- 58mm filters can be attached directly although you can buy $10 adapter for SX40.- Much faster and more accurate AF.- Much faster STS times, write times, shorter lag.- Much better EVF and LCD size and resolution.- For some swivel LCD is an advantage but for some titling is better and easier.- This is subjective but Fuji is better than Canon in color reproduction.- Native RAW support although you can have one in SX40 thru CHDK.CONS- SX40 optical zoom is an advantage for a very distant subject.- Optical IS is better than Sensor-shift IS.- For some swivel LCD is an advantage but for some titling is better and easier.- More expensive- SX40 video is better.- SX40 Live-view is better and more accurate.- CHDK would be a nice addition if only supported.I uploaded sample pictures in the gallery.

I think I like it more than her but she has never been much of a gadget person:)  The EXR mode has seemed to do a great job in most cases, especially in bright outdoor situations.  Like most photography, you still need to take many pictures to better your chances at getting a great shot but this to me is part of the fun.  I have 3 kids (7 & 9 years old) that are VERY active.  Usually I can get a good picture of them being active after multiple shots but this seems to be my biggest struggle. I am working on learning all the details of what this camera can do and hopefully I can master the shutter proirity mode \"S\" to minimize some blur issues.Like many have said, when using the HS30's powerful zoom to its max you would be best to use a tripod but you can still get some good pics if you control your steady hand or lean on something.  The rechargable battery is GREAT and lasts a very long time.  We used the camera for a week and a half of casual, occasional pictures!  - but beware when the battery indicator loses one bar it will die VERY soon. Reccomended that you charge the battery every night to assure you will NEVER have a dead battery (in Li-ion batteries this is OK and will not hurt the battery)  Get a backup battery if you want complete assurance.  Make sure you get a large capacity Class 10 SD card so you will not be limited.Pros:EXR mode is handy and effective30x zoom is very handyTakes GREAT outdoor/ bright photosGREAT indoor flash photos (moving objects need to be minimal)MANY options to make that perfect picture (if you take the time to discover and learn)RAW file optionSet up like a DSLR without the priceBEST in class battery life.Nice looking cameraFeels good to hold and has professional feelCons:Still a Point a Shoot (superzoom) so don't expect DSLR results or performanceAction photos a little hard to control blur (may be something I am doing wrong)A bit pricey (but the battery life is worth the price - really)Here are a few photos I have taken.

Writing speed is awesome and the zoom is fast, too.  Picture quality is excellent in the pics I have shot.  Color is great, without any tweaking.  The camera is considerably smaller than the prior S200EXR.  The HS30 has just about any feature you would want or need.  So many features, I probably won't use all of them.

I love that it has some you can save to your own setting (ex. for quick action sports) & look forward to how I want to set those.

Settings for photos and movies are very accessible through the menu.Big thing for me is how comfortable it is to hold & shoot with -- grips are in just the right spots & the weight of it isn't noticeable (which I was concerned about prior to buying).  My wrists aren't in great shape, so that means a lot to me!I bought a kit at the same time & just keep the UV filter on to protect the lens.

Thus far this camera is amazing for what I paid. The price seems to have gone up since then but it's still an extraordinary deal. This approaches SLR quality yet is $2-300 cheaper than even a basic SLR. It should be noted though that this is basically the same camera as the Fujifilm FinePix HS25EXR except that that one takes AA batteries while this one has its own brand. Also, the SDHC Card on this one isn't located in the same compartment as the battery so every time you change the card the camera doesn't turn itself off. I really hate that space-saving feature on a lot of cameras these days.I'm coming onto this from a Fujifilm FinePix JZ300, which was nice except that I wore out the rubber on the zoom lens through overuse. I can tell I won't have that problem on this one since the lens doesn't move in and out every time I turn on the camera. In fact the zoom lens is adjusted mechanically by twisting it, a must for me since it allows for greater control and accuracy. This camera has a 30x lens which allows for incredible closeups. It's basically like having binoculars hooked up to the front of your camera. I was able to zoom in and make out a hawk in the distance that I just plain couldn't see with my own eyes. This incredible zoom just makes it all the more unforgivable that the camera has a plastic tripod screw. How on earth can you make a camera with a 30x zoom and not expect people to use it with a tripod?This isn't an SLR but it's close. The lens is built in and unchangeable, but it's good enough that only real pros would need a different one. It even has decent macro settings. The settings do take a little fiddling with to get them to work right. The manual isn't particularly helpful in this regard. But the automatic mode (EXR) is pretty basic to use and does a good job of determining the proper settings to take the best picture. Once you figure out how to use it manual mode works very well. Changing the aperture and the shutter speed is pretty simple and there is a manual focus dial that makes it quite easy to use. The ISO and aperture are adjusted though a dial next to the mode dial while the focus is on the lens itself. Only complaint here is that the viewscreen doesn't show you the picture you'll actually take but just the view out of the lens. That means it'll take a lot of practice to get good shots out of this. Fortunately it takes pictures really quick so you can try quite a lot of things in a short period of time.There are nine other modes to chose from but those are the only two I really bother with. Panorama mode is really cool when it works, which it usually doesn't. Having the gyroscope on is essential for this. It is rather more successful when recording a less than 360\u00b0 view. I may get more use from this mode when I actually go somewhere worth getting a panoramic view of, but for now it's just a waste. I have a panoramic app on my iPhone that's a lot less finicky. Another mode takes 3d pics which seems cool but is just sort of gimmicky. Also there are two modes which are basically half of manual mode: one of which has auto aperture but manual shutter speed and the other mode has the inverse. Apart from these you're better off just sticking to automatic. Surprisingly the video mode isn't located on the dial but has its own dedicated button. This allows you to take photos while you're using the video camera. Pretty cool. It records in 1080p which is bluray quality video. It all looks pretty good. Only thing is that it only records video for 29 minutes at a time, so if you're thinking this can replace a dedicated video camera then you're gonna be disappointed. No I don't know why it won't record an even 30, it just doesn't.So, gidgets that I like about this camera: it has a gyroscope that helps you keep the camera level which is very useful for horizon shots. It flips vertically when you turn the camera on its side. There's an anti-blur feature which is useful but rarely seems to do much. It's a bit hard to tell whether it's working. Like all fujifilm cameras nowadays it features facial recognition software which works quite well unless there are multiple (or occasionally no) faces in shot.  There are USB and HDMI outputs hidden under a panel in the side which are useful for displaying your photos over a TV or computer. The other side holds the memory card and the battery in two separate compartments. I've heard people have problem with the flash, but that hasn't happened to mine yet. It does need to be manually opened and one of the more annoying features of silent mode is that it turns the flash off too. It does feature a slot on the top for an external flash which may be useful as the built in one isn't very impressive. I like having a viewfinder that I can look down but I wish it stuck out since my nose keeps rubbing against the main viewscreen. There is a light sensor next to the viewfinder that determines whether you're looking through that or using the main screen. It tends to switch back and forth whenever you move your hand so I just set it to stick on one or the other. The viewscreen has a pretty awesome feature that lets you pop it out so that you can see it while holding the camera at an angle. This hasn't come in useful yet but I'm sure it'll come in handy later. If you ever need to shoot over something this feature will be a lifesaver. The camera comes with a reasonably good strap but not with a case (at least mine didn't). You're gonna want to get one as when you have the strap around your neck the camera knocks back and forth against its viewscreen.Most of the minor problems are pretty minor. There is no way to charge the battery without removing it or to plug the camera in and use it though a wall outlet. Some of the controls are hard to figure out. The zoom is so powerful that you can easily zoom too far and get blurry photos if you don't watch out. And as previously mentioned the tripod screw is made of plastic and will not last. But aside from that it's a really excellent device. I'll be updating this over time as I get a better feel for it's capabilities, but thus far I've had no problems.

I've been an amateur photographer for some 45 years and have used all of the top name camera's, and this camera is a great camera that takes remarkable pictures and is relatively easy to use.  Of course it helps to have a working knowledge of basic photography skills, but anyone having those skills will get great results using this camera.  I still use a high end 35mm SLR and a newer DSLR, but I find I use the Fujifilm HS30EXR much more than I ever thought I would. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a mid-range bridge or a general all purpose camera.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "oldmotem \"kevin\"", "ReviewID": "R13AI1EWZFCLUO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from a non-Amazon source.  However,  the price was right.  I've always wanted a camera and lens combo that was small and light.  I've been photographing with various Canon and Nikon DSLRs for years.  I have an early model Olympus (C-8080) that I still love.  That camera is a forerunner of all these new \"mirrorless\" cameras.  The HS30 is a vast improvement on that old model Olympus.Best points:  Lens.  Only one.  Don't have to change lenses.  Don't have to carry heavy telephoto lenses up those long trails.  Don't have to change lenses while out in dirty conditions so there's no problems with getting those nasty dirt spots on the image sensor. I hate cleaning off image sensors.  And hate even more getting dirt spots off photos with editing tools.Light and compact.  It's smaller than any other camera I own (except the one built in to the smartphone which doesn't autofocus anymore).Autofocus.  The smartphone's is broken.  But the autofocus on this HS30 is GREAT.  Fast,  precise.  I try to take photos of the stars at night with my DSLRs.  Good luck.  Forget autofocus.  And the manual focus?  Try looking through a tiny viewfinder at night.  I have.  It doesn't work.  The HS30 can focus on the moon easily and most of the time on the stars even in a dark area of the sky.  Nice.Manual focus.  FAR better than anything I have on my DSLRs.  You get a blow-up of the image on the LCD screen and you also get a lit-up yellow slider with a floating white dot at the end.  Turn it until you see best focus (it's hair trigger so go slowly) and you should also see the white dot slide to the right maximally along with the yellow slider.  It takes a little practice,  but it's very do-able.  Far better than focusing through a tiny viewfinder on a DSLR.Tons of exposure modes and manual mode as well.  It has all the standard modes (PASM) as well as those wonderful EXP and a lot of other auto-modes.  I very often use EXP in high resolution mode with ISO 100 to get some really great shots.  Exposure is varied depending on what you point the camera at.  Auto-compensates for bright objects and auto-exposes with manual override for exposure under or over the norm.  Very nice.Battery.  I have several.  I change them about once every week or two.  And I take LOTS of photos.  The battery lasts for many 100s of photos.  Maybe 1000 or more.  Amazing.  I bought extras on Amazon along with an included cheap charger.  They work fine.Negatives:  Sometimes if I flick the camera off and then on right away,  it won't go on.  I just flick it off and wait about 5 seconds and turn it on again.  No problems after that.  The ISO button is beginning to lose its letters from being pressed so often to look at the photos on the LCD (the ISO button is the zoom-in button).  Not really a problem.  This is a high use device so I expect some wear.This is not a negative:  It's just that when you use this camera you forget when you zoom in you really have to be a photographer and remember to use a tripod or else stand VERY STILL.  Or put the camera on something and use the remote trigger.  Zooming in causes blur quite easily when zoomed in far.  But this is the case with ANY camera zoomed in far.There aren't too many negative things to say about this camera.  Mine works fine.Things I like a lot:  PANORAMIC VIEW.  Practice with this.  It's GREAT!  You can get a beautiful vista photograph (panograph) much more easily than by taking multiple photos and stitching them together in photo editing software.  You do get some stitch artifacts at times,  but you can get some great 120 to 360 degree photos with this camera.EXP:  That auto mode with its submodes has gotten me some wonderful photos!MACRO: It works great.  Extreme close-ups of flowers,  or whatever.Super-MACRO:  Even CLOSER photos of flowers,  or whatever.The Lens:  It's not a $5000 Canon or Nikon lens.  But I don't have the money to buy those lenses anyway.  For the cost of this camera,  you won't even get a lens from  Nikon or Canon that zooms anywhere near what this lens can and for its quality.  There is not too much wide angle curvature (I have other lenses on DSLRS that have worse).  The lens takes great photos from wide to nearly zoomed in fully.  And when zoomed in fully it takes very good photos IF you use a tripod.  It does sometimes have auto-focus issues when zoomed in fully.  It takes more time to focus in that mode.  I just zoom out a little.  Then the focus is much easier.  I rarely use any telephoto on full zoom in anyway.Overall,  for the price I paid and for the photos I've been able to get with this little camera,  it's been well worth owning.  I've had it since mid-October and have taken well over 10,000 photos with it.  Nice.I want another one.  Just to cover the time when this one (if it does) someday wears out.P.S.  It shoots video too.  I haven't really done much of that.  Too busy with still photos.  There are other reviews in here about shooting at night (star photos) and the lack of longer than 30 second exposures.  ISO 100 at 30 seconds is what you get.  ISO 200 and about 15 seconds or so.  Etc.  Someone else has that info in his review here on the site.  I have been able to get some really nice 30 second star shots with this camera on a tripod and the remote trigger.  Or else use the 10 second delay timer.  It's also excellent for moon shots.  You don't need more than about 1/100 second or so for the moon anyway.The main difference between this camera and an expensive DSLR with $5000 lens is the slight grain you get when you blow up photos to 2 feet by 3 feet or so.  The DSLR will have less grain.  That's not a big deal for me.  This camera on ISO 100 gets some really GREAT photos!", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the price", "Author": "Facundo Pezzi \"facucat\"", "ReviewID": "R3M6LNTR4ZG4TU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a friend of mine during a trip.

Robinson", "ReviewID": "ROGE3JLAII1UD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My primary interest is wildlife, and especially birds. So the long zoom is essential.The EXR 1/2\" sensor is what sets this camera apart from other mega zoom cameras in this price range. Because of the way the pixels are arranged, it can take higher quality photos at 8 MP, rather than lower quality photos at 12 or 16 MP.  Trust me, 8 MP is still plenty of resolution, it's the noise (especially false colors) that destroys a photo, not the resolution.The1/2\" sensor is a little bigger than many other mega zoom cameras, but not as big as DSLR sensors.  This means that the image quality is a little better than other cameras in this class.  But since the size of the lens is directly proportional to the size of the sensor, the lens isn't a foot long.  It's a good compromise.EXR Hi ISO low noise (S/N) mode combines pixels to form \"super pixels\" to reduce noise .  This adds a fuzzyness to the images when looked at up close. But this is less objectionable than noise.This mode does not allow digital zoom. But it does allow you to take \"snapshot\" photos in low light where others would fail.EXR Resolution Priority mode lets me set the ISO, and maintains a 16 MP picture and allows for digital zooming. This is my favorite EXR mode for long zooms in good light, especially where I might have to crop later.EXR Dynamic Range Priority splits the pixels in two, such that half of them fire at higher sensitivity and half at lower sensitivity, simultaneously .  It then combined the two images to produce an8 NO picture that brings out details in shadows while not washing out bright area of the picture.  This mode disables flash, and overrides the ISO I set. But it does allow for digital zoom.EXR Auto not only selects one of the above EXR modes, but may also select a \"scene\" mode, such as beach, portrait, or landscape. It may also select a macro mode, or even the \"Pro Low-Light\" mode. It senses whether there is a face in the scene, or a moving subject, and adjusts accordingly.Pro Low Light is one of the \"advanced\" modes.  It will take 4 frames in rapid succession and layer them to bring out detail and reduce noise. This is very impressive, but requires a still subject and a still hand (or tripod). Since it fires the shots at 11 frames/second, the overall exposure time is still only about 1/2 second, but that is still too much time for a moving subject.  For example, it will take four shots at 1/8 second, f/5.6, and ISO 3200 to produce an OK image, where at ISO 400, and f/5.6, the shutter would be 2 seconds.  1/8 second is hand-holdable.  2 seconds is not.It is still a challenge to get a good crisp, image in very low light, but it is significantly better than hand held ISO 3200. It sometimes also produces a darker image, which makes sense since the camera knows that it is a dark scene.One of the characteristics of small sensor cameras like this is that they have an exceptionally deep depth of field. This means that the subject matter and the background are often both in focus. This can be a good thing, if that's what you're looking for, but some times, you want the background to be out of focus so that the subject \"pops\". Another advanced mode of the HS30 is called \"Pro Focus Mode\". This actually takes two photos. One with the subject (and often the background) in focus, and one with the background out of focus. It then merges the 2 photos to leave the background out of focus. I'm not sure how the camera chooses what is to remain in focus, and what is not, but so far, it has done a pretty good job.One of my favorite modes is called \"Natural & Flash\". This takes two photos in rapid succession. The first without the flash, and the second with the flash.ISO 200 has pretty good S/N and allows better speed than ISO 100. That's probably the best default, except for very bright conditions. ISO 400 starts introducing noise, but it really isn't that bad.The flash is surprisingly powerful, but depletes the battery. Buy extra batteries.  It is also extremely fast. I have used the built in flash strobe to stop the the wings of a humming bird in flight.The battery charger that comes with the unit comes with a 3' cord, which is a bit cumbersome when traveling. I recommend buying batteries and a charger that plugs directly into the wallGenerally speaking, it selects a high ISO too often. I suspect because the most common complaint is picture blur caused by camera shake. But maybe I'm being too critical here. Noise in ISO 400 isn't that bad. I may be looking closer than I should. I haven't printed any hard copies yet for a side-by-side comparison.Another feature that sets this camera apart is the manual zoom ring on the lens barrel. This functions much like the zoom on a traditional SLR.  It is much faster and precise than the typical lever and motorized zoom.  More about that, and it's short comings later.The camera has two \"intelligent digital zoom\" levels 1.6X, and 2.0X. I find that the quality of the 1.6X digital zoom is excellent, and indistinguishable from the optical zoom alone. The 2.0X zoom does start to degrade image quality, but still very usable.It seems that none of the other flash manufacturers provide TTL flash units for Fuji.  So if you want TTL you'll have to go with a Fuji Unit.  They seem like good reasonably priced flashes, but they don't produce a ring flash.Manual Focus:The manual focus ring is my greatest disappointment with this camera,  because it is not physically coupled to the focus mechanism, but rather a controller for the focus motor. This means there is a slight lag as you are focusing, resulting in over-shooting your intended focus point and having to back track.Also, the focus \"meter\" shown on screen tells you if what it thinks should be in focus is in focus, not the focus distance. This is pretty much useless because I'm usually using manual focus because the camera doesn't know what to focus on in the first place (the branches in front of the bird, or the bird). It also doesn't tell you if you need to bring the focus in or out, so there is a lot of fidgeting.Since the focus ring is just free-spinning, there is no stop when you are focused on infinity or nearest focus. When looking through the viewfinder at a blurred image, you don't know whether you are focused in too far, or out too far, so you have to try spinning the ring in both directions until your subject is in focus, and once again the focus lag hinders this. While this system is superior to the typical point and shoot manual focus system (with a toggle lever), it could certainly be much better.Using the AE/AF lock button (below the movie button) to force an auto-focus even when in manual focus mode is very helpful, and makes up for the above shortcoming.This is a solid (ie relatively heavy) camera. Still lighter than a DSLR, but still a substantial weight. As such, the large grip with a protrusion for your thumb is very ergonomic, as are all the controls.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Digital Camera I  ever Had!!!", "Author": "Circus Circus \"Ken\"", "ReviewID": "RIZ4A8AFQJ1XJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fujifilm FinePix HS30EXR Digital CameraThis is my first Review ever of any Camera on AMAZON or on any site.

I am an Amateur in this world of Phothography and I have practiced a lot with this Camera and read the complete manual thoroughly. Is not an easy Camera to learn, I can tell you that.

This is an exceptional, well built and very Practical camera. I know many of you think and believe this is an awfull, badly built and very difficult to learn Camera!!. Not so. You have to dedicate time, practice a lot and read many, many Blogspot, Sites and reviews, to really start to get a grip on this Camera.I am very happy with it and I paid a very low price for it, so that makes it sweeter to me. I sometimes shoot Raw and PP using the bundle software that came with my Camera. But mostly I shoot out mainly in JPG's on Family meetings, my grandkids parties and plays on playground with them. Also I shoot  Landscapes and take lots of movies with it and I think they are outstanding quality. From all the 2000 shots I have taken, probably I have thrown out 200 shots and that to me is an outstanding miracle because most shots have been taken on moving and playing with kids around. With all that in mind, I have no doubts to recommend and praise a lot this Camera HS30-EXR and will encourage anyone thinking on buying a good, solid and pratical Bridge, day to day camera that will last you many, many years!!!.

Basically, it's got the features of a digital SLR in a smaller format, so you get the great zoom range without having to change lenses or have something that sticks out two feet in front of the camera.  My first experience with it was hiking up on a ridge trail near where I live and getting some awesome telephoto shots on a clear day overlooking our town and the Sacramento Delta. I used a monopod, and the pis were sharp and the colors vibrant.The controls are laid out well; there are a lot of extra buttons dedicated to things like setting AutoFocus mode, Exposure compensation, ISO, video, white balance AF/AE lock, continuous mode shooting so you don't have to dig down into menus.An electronic viewfinder was a must for me. I take a lot of landscape shots, and LCD's are very hard to see in bright sunlight. It automatically senses when you bring it up to your eye and switches to EVF.  The tiltable LCD screen is a great feature also.The EXR modes have some really cool features - like taking multiple shots at different exposures and combining them to extend the dynamic range.I like that the zoom is controlled by rotating the lens barrel just like on an SLR. You can also set it to manual focus via rotating the barrel.  The lens has threads so you can use filters, polarizers, etc.Battery life is very good. I'm still on my first charge.  In my previous cameras I had shied away from rechargables because you always had to make sure it was charged before you could grab your camera, and if you are out in the woods and your battery runs out, your hosed.

I can get rid of the noise up to ISO 400 in either Lightroom 4 or Nik's Dfine 2.0 without noticeable degradation in picture quality, but it's an extra step in processing that would be better handled by a better sensor. Beyond ISO 400 the camera is essentially useless.Otherwise, there are a lot of good things to say about this camera. Very little distortion even at the widest angles available. Lots of manual control and enormous flexibility. It's very light, but solidly built. I really like the manual zoom. Much easier to use than the motorized zoom in most cameras in this price range. The electronic viewfinder is surprisingly good. Controls and menus are well laid out for quick access to the settings you need to use most frequently.The only other issue is speed. It takes a long time to record an image and be ready to shoot again, especially if you are shooting RAW. The software supplied for RAW processing is terrible, but Lightroom 4/Adobe Camera RAW handles it just fine.Battery lasts a really long time, and third party spares are inexpensive and excellent. Charging time is about 2 hours.I bought the camera because I need the super zoom and manual controls in a lightweight package and it fits that need very well except for the fact that the images are always too noisy.

Nope.  Not at all.  The face recognition mode (and dog face mode) took soft, even blurry, pictures and the auto release was too slow to even catch the face shot anyway (in one instance catching two tails instead of faces), I do better on my own.The only reason I did give it two stars is that I LOVE the manual zoom and the way the camera feels in my hands.  The tilt screen is also a nice feature.  These points made me sad to have to send this camera back and I tried really hard to make it work for me.

It is not a DSLR and it is never going to be- it is a bridge camera.  I also have an expensive pro camera and I will tell you how often I use it: never.  It is heavy, bulky, and does not have much of a zoom lens on it.  I have used the HS 10 all the time because it is light weight, has a great zoom lens on it, takes entirely decent photographs and I can easily take it anywhere.As the saying goes- the best camera you have is the one you take with you and use.Out of the box today I can see that the HS 30 is a big improvement over my HS 10.  For one thing, it will shoot in RAW or RAW plus JPEG.  That is awesome.  Also the zoom is threaded (58 mm).  That means I can slap a teleconverter lens on it if I don't think I already have enough zoom.One of the things I really like about bridge cameras like the HS 30 is that you can let the camera make the decisions for fast shooting, or you can do manual override and make the decisions yourself.I like the small form factor.  That means I will really use this camera.  The grip is very comfortable for my woman's hand.Nikons and Canons in this classification were also rans for me.  I would be able to get longer zooms elsewhere, but early reports said the image quality with the competitors was not quite as good.  Since image quality is very important, I decided that if I wanted a longer zoom I could thread on a teleconverter.The included software to view photographs didn't work with my Mac Powerbook, but that is a non-issue since I have other photo editing software I use and really like.So just out of the box today: so far so good!

I live on a farm in an extremely bio-diverse environment in Colombia and needed a highly portable, versatile camera for both macro and extreme telephoto shots as opportunities arose.  This camera has filled my need although not without a learning curve and experimentation.  I have used it nearly every day for the past 11 months. Macro and extreme tele both give excellent results.  Nature photos taken on \"automatic pilot\" often do not turn out well.  The camera heavily over-exposes; fortunately the exposure compensation and bracketing controls are convenient because I use them in nearly every shot.  The electronic viewfinder is just a little better than no viewfinder at all but is functional once you get accustomed to dealing with its delays and erratic lighting.  It is a necessary feature here where LCD screens often blank out.  The tilting LCD is useful for getting shots at odd angles although when tilted up to the 90 degree position, it apparently sometimes confuses the EVF sensor and turns off the screen so you have to regroup and try again.  This is not a fast camera.  It is rarely useful for bird photography.  I have not tried many of its features because I don't need them.  I chose this model because I am a fan of Fujifilm products and especially of the color rendition of Fuji digitals.  It has not let me down in that respect.  Has it been worthwhile?  Eminently, because of hundreds of usable photos I have taken with it that I would have missed otherwise by having the wrong camera or no camera at all when the chance came.  I don't doubt that I could have been equally happy with a different camera, color rendition being equal.  It doesn't replace the DSLR either; my Fuji and Nikon DSLR's still get frequent use.  For my purposes it has been excellent.  Would I recommend it?  It's now an outdated model so I would look for a more recent version if buying now.  The used price is down around $200 I believe and it should be a good value a that, worth trying out to see if it fits your particular needs if you're out for a super-zoom.

It replaced a much older FujiFilm camera, and the additions in features are huge. The photo quality is better, low-light performance is better, and the automatic functions have improved. I specifically wanted a camera with a hot shoe for a separate flash, a long zoom (30x), and one with anti-shake, which this one has. It uses a proprietary battery rather than four AA cells, which turned out to be an advantage. I got two spare batteries and an additional charger, so there will always be one or two fully charged spares. The official Fuji batteries are pricey, but I got the spares + charger from a non-brand-name place here on Amazon. I have gotten several games (300+ photos and 3-hours of on-time) without replacing the battery.With kids who are three-sport athletes, I shoot in poorly-lit conditions--night football, in gyms--and I used to have to manually set the ASA and shutter speed for the action. The HS30EXR has a \"Sport\" mode that produces game/meet photos better than manual settings. The face detection function in EXR mode makes sure that faces are what gets optimized for lighting the focus.From shooting outdoors in all conditions, I needed a camera that was heavy on the features, but not so expensive that I'd be afraid to take it out in the rain or snow, and the HS30EXR packs a lot of features and quality for the price. A couple pleasant surprises have been how nice the large external screen is for both shooting and for reviewing photos, and that the screen goes blank when the camera senses that you've put your eye to the eyepiece.I was worried about the duration of the charge of the proprietary battery and the cost of replacements, but as written above, the Fuji battery has been an advantage over AA's. Another concern was that I was used to a motorized zoom, and the HS30EXR's zoom is manual. That took very little time to get used to, plus it's less of a drain on the battery. It also took very little time to get used to the controls which are different than my old FujiFilm camera. The HS30EXR uses the more common SD card rather than xD.There's so much that this camera can do that I go through the manual (downloaded as PDF online) and try to learn one new thing at a time.

Experimenting with manual changes can greatly improve the pictures in low light conditions.I really like the manual zoom, the excellent viewfinder, the solid build quality and the good continuous shooting capability.(+2)Some easy way to figure out exactly what features are available under which modes would be SOOOhelpful.(-1)The manual is colmplete, but difficult to follow.

The Fujifilm camera doesn't replace my SLR camera but I been using it more for all my everyday photography.In the automatic mode is very basic. EXR Auto tries to be smart and quick to adjust to different scene selects. It also gives you the options of setting it on how the EXR functions, like low light,dynamic range, high res. In any setting the colors are rich and vivid, which can be changed at any point to your liking. Dynamic range can be changed from 100%, 200% to 400%. Panoramic mode only does 360 view and can't be change which is a bummer. Burst mode disables flash. I generally shoot in manual mode and the light meter does very well when its set to center weight. The camera will start up within a second. There is also a setting that lets it shut down 2-5 minutes but will quick start by pressing the shutter button within 20 minutes.ISO speeds run from 100-1600 without changing photo settings. 3200 ISO runs a 8mp.The lens is about your basic f2.8-5.6. It lacks anything above f11. The focus ring in manual mode is very quick and responsive. Super Macro is sharp and being able to have a bright 3\" tilt screen is handy when its not easy to look through the view finder when shooting a macro shot. There is a AE & AF lock on the camera. The fact that it has a focus and telephoto ring, sold me.Shooting Video does pretty good but don't expect the world. You want to make sure the focus is on continuous. Focus is a bit slow and video sometimes has a trail look.The second thing that sold me was the Flash hot shoe. Fujifilm EF-42 is an excellent flash unit. While Fujifilm doesn't provide a sync cord but a Canon sync cord will allow the flash to fully function with the flash.Very good all around camera. It is worth considering if anyone is looking at the \"S\" series. \"HS\" series has a little bit bigger sensor then the \"S\" series. If you like the manual feel of turning a lens instead of pushing a button and/or the need for a hot shoe, this is it.

My first camera was a Minolta ST101 with a number of fixed focal length lenses.  Used for many years and then I went to a Cannon EOS.  I was thrilled when lens technology produced a 28-200 mm zoom.  It worked for 90%+ of what I wanted to do but it was big and heavy.Enter the digital camera.  My first was a 2 mpxl Canon Elph.  It took good pictures but not what I was used to.  It fit in my pocket though and convenience was a factor.  I went through several digital cameras as technology developed and my current unit (soon to be back-up) is a Panasonic ZS8.  It takes very good pictures and fits in my pocket.  The EOS was sold on EbayNow, I miss my SLRs viewfinder and all the settings I could adjust to tweak the image.  I do not miss hauling around a bag full of lenses and accessories not to mention exposed film. Enter the bridge camera now come of age.I did hours of research on various camera review sites and on Amazon.  I narrowed my choices to a Fuji HS30 EXR, a Canon SX40HS and a Panasonic FZ60.  On paper I had a difficult time as to which was the best one and ultimately ordered the Canon based open many prior very good experiences with Canon.  I also would have a good idea how to negotiate the camera settings pretty well.It\u2019s a great camera.  I took pictures in the back yard of birds and squirrels, macros of flowers, kids at play and some landscapes with difficult lighting.  I took it on a weekend trip and took some night shots and beach shots and purposely pushed its limits.  I found it a bit slow to focus, especially at the long end and further still with lower light conditions.  I did not like using the motorized long lens and the viewfinder; it was somehow clumsy.I sent it back and got the Fuji HS30 EXR.  First thing I noticed was that focusing is quick and accurate.  I really like how the manual zoom feature works.  It\u2019s a little thing but the size and grip feel better in my hand.The professional reviews made issues of the dots in the viewfinder and the LCD but I did not find those to be issues.  The menu in the Canon is easier to negotiate, maybe because I\u2019ve been there before.  I find the Fuji lens to be plenty long enough but Cannon is clearly longer.  The Canon is better at exposure in difficult lighting but I am used to bracketing under those conditions.  Time will tell but the Canon\u2019s face recognition appears to be better but I will more likely use my Panasonic ZS8 when taking people pictures anyway.When I made the purchase, I was trying to capture the best of a good pocket camera and an SLR and hence my interest in a bridge camera. Either of these cameras would have done the job but I think my heritage with a manual zoom has helped make my final decision the Fuji.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "You'll like it if you're an amateur looking for really good shots!", "Author": "Muchtaller", "ReviewID": "R28ELXFFVPXMGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lots of features - more than I'll use!

Nikon would not warranty it based on the serial number, and I didn't feel comfortable keeping it. Amazon was good about exchanging the item. (I'm wondering if they resold it to someone else.) They were the direct seller on this camera, too, so I was a little apprehensive that it would also be a gray-market item. When I received it, I immediately registered it on Fujifilm's website, and they recognized the serial number. So, I'm assuming it's legitimate. I've only used the camera a few times now - twice on outings in the great outdoors and once for some inside photos. I've been happy with the results, altho I don't know nearly enough yet about how to use it. I really like the manual zoom, which conserves the battery and (from what I've read) is much less prone to break-down than an auto-zoom, and also the threaded lens, which accepts filters you can buy in any local camera shop. It seems like a nice step up from a simple point-and-shoot but less expensive than a full-fledged DSLR. I would say - after this experience with Amazon, I would only buy an expensive electronic device like this from a reputable online store, such as D&H; Camera, or a local brick-and-mortar store.

Using it now would be like using an Instamatic with a flashcube.  I do a lot of nature shots with a fair amount in macro. The macro is just as good if not better than my old S9000, have to use some more to see if any difference.  However the 30x optical leaves my old S9000 in the dust.  The 60x intelligent zoom is mind blowing, got some bird shots worth the price of the camera and the hassle with the charger.  The digital zoom on my S9000 never took one usable picture, way to grainy.

during recording and playback is normal.  I know very little about photography, and I got this camera yesterday from another site (used / like new for a good price) and - as much as I like it - I will have to return it if it is defective.  I have spoken with several people today, neither of whom could tell me what is normal for this camera.  Other than the distortion, I like the camera.  Please help me figure this out.  As you can tell in the video, I did not have and extraneous sounds going on at the time. Usually I hear lots of motorized sounds, this time, there was more popping than usual.I am a bit under a deadline as I am hoping to use this at a lecture and concert next week, this is why I am desperately trying to find out what is (a)typical here. Even if I am not doing anything, and I just hold the camera to my ears, I can hear a low hissing sound.  I have adjusted the playback volume, which has not helped.  I do not know if there is a mic sensitivity level to adjust; I have not found one.  I am actually hoping that the cause is due to user error - but....Thanks for your feedback, and I certainly will adjust review and rating accordingly.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm HS30EXR", "Author": "Yolanda Musante", "ReviewID": "R2FLMP306RG7QO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought these cameras for my relatives....

The camera hunts painfully at full extension to focus...it is nearly useless ...I have never seen a camera fail so miserably at being able to focus....worst ever and bad enough to totally not buy this camera .....The new HS50EXR goes out of its way to redo the focusing technology but it is pretty bad that they got it so darn wrong on the HS30EXR....2.  why have an LCD that only partially articulates? ..The HS50EXR does it right...Camera makers must stop doing this b.s. with LCD's......do it right or don't do it at all...Full articulation is the only way to go..Unfortunately the Sony A37 has the same type of partially articulating LCD as the 30EXR. But at least the Sony has an APS-C sized sensor compared to the tiny one on the 30EXR.3.  The lens hood that comes with the camera is the cheapest hood I have ever seen on a camera....I lost mine in good wind up by Ridgecrest the first time I used it...it is so light that when it blew off the camera  it got blown into the desert shrubs and I never could find it again..it probably ended up in Baker, CA...will try an EBAY replacement. But this lens hood is a Fuji embarrassment.4. Some people complain about not using AA batteries and I say good riddance. You can buy plenty of inexpensive chargers and 3rd party batteries on EBAY or AMAZON.  AA batteries suck.5.  I love the camera build and the fact it has a manual zoom..6.  I bought this camera along with a Sony SLT A37 DSLR because of all the cool features each has to supplement my Nikon D2Xs and D2Hs cameras...I found that I used the Sony A37 the most however...7.  A nice feature is that you can put on lens filters without using some goofball extension gizzmo.8.  The HS30EXR is so full of features that you really have to study the manual before using it.. ...it is sinking with features that are not intuitive in the least. If you don't get to the point of having good and quick operational knowledge of all the features then it is not worth price.  You can go to KEH.COM and buy a used Panasonic LUMIX FZ30 for about 120 dollars and have a great bridge camera for hardly any cost if you don't want to mine the features on these Fuji HS EXR line of cameras. If you have to fumble around trying to execute esoteric camera abilities then what good is a camera with all these features?  So be prepared to study and then practice if you want to push this camera to its limits.don't buy this Fuji HS30EXR camera unless it becomes deeply, deeply discounted....instead buy the HS50EXR if user feedback is good....The terrible focus abilities of this camera should make it off limits to making this purchase in my opinion...I own this camera and am sorry to make this statement but that's the way it is.Fuji's next step is to load this side of their line  with a full size APS sensor and about 5FPS for 25 or 30 frames meaning having a good buffer... Fuji needs to take these last marketing steps and give consumers a true, robust bridge camera.....that is why considering the Sony SLT A37 instead of these bridge cameras might be a good option even if you don't own any Sony or Minolta glass. The first manufacturer who can do this for around 400-500 dollars will have a real gem.  The new mirrorless niche lines coming out like the Nikon V2/J2, Sony NEX, and other similar cameras don't fill this gap since their sensors are not at least APS sized. Consumers are being jobbed over and over by these major camera makers to the point consumers are just telling them to go fly a kite and are using handheld phones/devices to totally replace traditional cameras especially with the introduction of APS for these cameras including auxiliary lenses that can be placed on these devices. The consumer has been jerked around so much re sensor size that many will have lost patience with the whole b.s. marketing scheme and just ignore these producers. Nikon and Canon cannot survive alone on their pro line. Fuji has NO pro line so they are positioned to cut from the pack and really do bridge cameras correctly.Fuji is clearly just about there but will they keep playing games like Canon and Nikon who have an entire pro line to support and sustain?  Fuji doesn't have this to worry about. They could blow apart the market if they decided to do it.  They have the camera body to accommodate this next step...the point being that if Sony can make the SLT A37 full of features and advancements for about the same price as this nearly highest end of Fuji bridge cameras, then there is no excuse not to make these improvements re sensor size and buffer/FPS.  The Fuji HS50EXR could have been that camera...maybe their next iteration of this HS EXR line will take that leap.Because of the miserable failure of the HS30EXR to focus at full to nearly full zoom extension...it is definitely condemned to the leper colony of bridge cameras and point and shoot cameras in general.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Photos for a once in a lifetime trip", "Author": "Maya Wariyar", "ReviewID": "R1YLAMPZ0RPSNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this camera for a once in a lifetime trip to Kenya.  It was a dream trip and had been in planning for years.  We are not very good photographers, but wanted a camera where we could take pictures to remember everything.  We knew our point and click camera really wouldn't do the job. But learning everything about a DLSR was just too intimidating. The HS30EXR was a good compromise.  It has a 30x zoom that we thought would do the job. The camera turned out to be very good for the trip.  We got great pictures of the Indian Ocean during sunrise and sunset.  The pictures of the animals on safari turned out to be very good.  We bought a 32 GB Transcend memory card that held the 1900 plus pictures we took on the trip.  The conditions for taking pictures were difficult because of early morning and late afternoon lighting plus animals moving through varied terrain.The few negative things to mention are:1. The automatic settings created pictures that were too bright in many shots.2. In the bright sunlight of the Kenyan savanna the image on the screen was not very visible.  The viewfinder was the better choice for taking pictures.3. The flash would not get ready very quickly.  I missed a shot of a rare bush baby because of the flash.4.  After the trip, I went through and had to adjust some of the pictures for brightness.  Again, I'm not very sophisticated so I just used Microsoft Office Picture Manager to adjust the brightness.  Nothing complex, just a mouse click.There were a few accessories that work well with this camera.  I recommend the 32 GB Transcend memory card and the following:1. Starter Accessories Kit For Fuji Fujifilm FinePix HS30EXR.  (Butterfly Photo had an affordable one.)2. Spare battery and charger.The HS30EXR camera captured many great images for us.  It was a trip of a lifetime and we have pictures to remember it by.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far.. love it", "Author": "Vegas Varmins \"Pet Person\"", "ReviewID": "R3QHQYF87WO5E2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't spent a lot of time with this yet.

The fact that it supported RAW file format and had a 30x zoom for the price all felt too good to be true.  And as it turns out, it was.  This camera is SLOW: to turn on, to wake up, to focus, to switch modes...the list goes on.  It also goes into sleep mode from which it is nearly impossible to wake it without turning it off then on again.  This wouldn't be so bad except that every time you turn the camera off then on again, you lose whatever custom or programmed settings you had made; reprogramming those settings over and over again because this crappy camera can't seem to wake from sleep is a real drag and caused me to miss any number of great shots, exposed properly.  The resolution and crispness of images with this camera is terrible, even in broad daylight with minimal zoom being used; images are SOFT SOFT SOFT.  And forget about any level of sharpness when using the zoom, even at the spec'd 30x, where the image quality is basically unusable, even at snapshot size.  Lastly, the Fuji RAW file format is rarely supported, if at all, by most of the programs out there so beware that you will have to use Fuji's REALLY sucky utility software to access your RAF files - it's a joke: lame, slow funtionality with an interface that looks like it was designed circa 1993.  Take my advice: for another $100, get the Lumix and you'll be A LOT happier.  And for another $300, get the lower end Nikon or Canon.  With this loser of a camera, Fuji proves in spades that you get what you pay for.

Barr", "ReviewID": "R1MAKMJK5V9QW5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If your primary need is a powerful zoom and your photographs are intended for small prints and online viewing, this camera will likely give you satisfactory and sometimes even impressive results for a reasonable price. However, if sharp details, overall picture quality, and enlarged prints are necessary and the large zoom is secondary, this camera is likely a downgrade from what you already own.Before purchasing, I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this camera, and one complaining that the pictures weren't as good as an iPhone 4S. I dismissed the latter and purchased the camera. But, he was right [sort of].This camera is the equivalent of a common point-and-shoot, but with a large zoom lens and a lot of manual controls. The 30x zoom is impressive and lets you get much closer to the subject, and in most cases the larger lens gives better depth-of-field effects than a camera phone or even many point-and-shoots. But, even under the best conditions, pictures are noisy and details are muddy and painterly. An iPhone, of course, has no optical zoom, but for close range shots, it does indeed pick-up more fine details with less noise than the FinePix HS30EXR, particularly in lower light situations. To test: With this camera in one hand and my iPhone in the other, I shot several pictures of my dog under indoor lighting. On the viewfinder or even fit onto a laptop screen, the pictures were fairly equivalent; however, zoomed in 100% the differences were clear. Where the iPhone was able to pick-up the detail of individual hairs, the FinePix simply showed a mottled, unclear texture. Outdoor performance was significantly better, but still noisy and lacking detail.Please check professional reviews. Although this camera has a look similar to a DSLR, it actually uses the same tiny image sensor used in a compact point-and-shoot and accordingly produces the same passable but unremarkable images.I sent mine back, and replaced it with a Sony Nex-5N and telephoto lens.
