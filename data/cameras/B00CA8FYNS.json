Huber", "ReviewID": "RHYNIPFBZYYY7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with this package. I am a DSLR user and usually shoot with a Canon 7D. I was looking for a smaller body so I could take it with me when traveling, vacations, and places where it's just not practical to carry a large DSLR.After doing a lot of research and considering similar models from Fuji, Olympus, Canon, Panasonic and others, I narrowed it down to this camera. I felt that this camera had the right balance of Image Quality (IQ), fast auto focus (AF), and a great electronic view finder (EVF) in a portable size.  As an added bonus, you can also obtain adapters for older style SLR lenses (must use manual focus, but it's fun, low cost, and this camera makes it easy!).  This camera hits the mark for my goals. One thing to consider: if you are a DSLR user and coming to this camera, you will most likely want to shoot with a faster lens. Similar to most DSLR kit lenses, the included lens with the NEX-6 is pretty basic. I was able to pick up an old Minolta AR Sigma f2.8 prime lens for next to nothing, and shoot with manual focus. With the canon adapter, I can also utilize some of my EF lenses. However, since I'm equally concerned about portability, I am trying to keep things small and light.This package is excellent. I could not find a better deal and am very happy with the included items. They all were packed well and shipped very quickly. The battery charger is definitely a must-have (you can also use the included USB charger but it takes longer). The battery charger includes a car adapter as well as a Europe friendly plug, which may come in handy if you are traveling. The included UV lens fits nicely on the kit lens. The ND filter is also handy. If you are in bright light situations you can stop it down a bit and avoid washed out shots.The 64 GB memory card is a very nice addition, especially if you plan on shooting video. The case is nothing fancy but it works well- it is just the right size for the camera, and you can fit a few things in the rear pouch. This kit has everything you need to go out and productively shoot. The only con I can think of is that the LCD protective screen is a little tough to get on. You have to carefully measure and cut it- I still have a few bubbles. I mistakingly cut the screen the wrong size on the first try; fortunately, there are 3 screens included. Measure twice and cut once!", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$814.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Sony Alpha NEX-6 Digital Camera Body & 16-50mm Lens (Black) + <2> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card + <3> Spare NP-FW50 Battery +\n<4> Battery Charger + <5> .45x Wide & 2.5x Tele Lens + <6> Shutter Remote Control +\n<7> PD-C15 Camera / Camcorder Case + <8> PD 40.5mm (UV/CPL/ND8) Filters + <9> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader +\n<10> PD Spudz Microfiber Cloth + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Sony Alpha NEX-6 Digital Camera Body & 16-50mm Lens (Black) with 64GB Card + Battery & Charger + Case + 3 UV/CPL/ND8 Filters + Tele/Wide Lenses + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TcxG9hOKL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CA8FYNS"}}
