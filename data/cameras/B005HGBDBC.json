Can you have fun with *this* camera pen? Possibly.As advertised, the Defender ST101 Covert Pinhole Color Security Camera Pen (with 4 GB USB Memory) takes still pictures and video. Provided your lighting is adequate, your pictures will be adequate, too. Nothing glorious, but they'll do the job. The video is choppy, but being able to clip the pen to your pocket and stroll around with the camera running is easier than holding your cell phone and walking around (or maybe it's just me that has that problem). Sound, of course, would have to be added in post-production.You can surreptitiously photograph people/things, though concealing the amber/blue light may be an issue. I've taken random candid shots and pictures of notes on a whiteboard and they came out \"good enough.\" Nothing I couldn't have done (better) with a cell phone, but the USB was a handier option than Bluetooth or cable syncing with my computer. That said, I suspect most potential purchasers will be plenty happy with the technology they already own rather than add this pen/camera/USB drive to their kit.If you're not prone to buyer's remorse and/or your therapist doesn't have your secret agent obsession handled with medication or hypnosis, give the camera pen a go. Otherwise content yourself with the more-powerful options you likely already own.

It's very easy to use, requiring only the information in the little booklet that comes with it. I would have given it three stars except that it doesn't work very well as a pen. The ink flow is too unreliable to be worth the trouble of trying to use it.I've found the quality of the photos and video to be pretty decent if the lighting is good and the pen is held level while photographing. Any angling of the pen, close-ups, or low light results in blurry and/or useless photos, which means it wouldn't be too helpful for a real spy. Also, you have to hold the pen vertically at eye level to be sure that what you're seeing is roughly what you're photographing. This would make you look mighty suspicious if you were trying to be secretive.One thing I've found inconvenient is that you have to unscrew the two halves of the pen to switch back and forth between video and still shots. Also, that switch is tiny and hard to operate, and might be prone to breakage with frequent use.If you want a fun toy that's easy to operate and handy to carry, this might suit your needs.

Was able to get it back together but I don't have high hopes that it will stay put for long.  The video is okay but jumpy, the field of vision is limited - pretty much takes video directly in line with the pen (not much above or below) so trying to record a scene or a class could be difficult to do \"on the sly\" as you may have to lift the pen up or down.  Additionally, there is a distinct amber/blue light which shows when the pen is off or on - not something that a traditional pen would have and which will give away the fact that you are recording a scene.  As a classroom lecture pen, it doesn't make much sense as there is no sound recording.I would say it could be okay for a teenager but the fact that the pen fell apart means it is worthless unless they are extremely careful (not something teens are noted for!)Interesting concept though, perhaps a pen by a more reliable manufacturer with better video quality and sound would be a good purchase.

I do a lot of work at white boards while working on various panels.  One of the useful tools for collaboration is a simple digital camera.  This is a very small digital camera with a decent resolution, and it is much smaller than other cameras.  I tend to use this device in work related items now to good effect.So, if you are already using a digital camera then this could be a reasonable substitute.There are lots of other uses where this would be helpful, videos of folks being greeted at airports where you would like your hands to be free to shake hands, hug folks, etc.Of course, I'm sure that there are many, potential nefarious uses of such technology too, and I imagine that even folks with the purest of hearts would have to be careful not to slip-up and potentially get themselves in trouble with such a device.For example, I would not want to run this through an airport checkpoint in my carry-on items.  I don't think that it is forbidden, but if I were a travel security guy, having this in your items would raise some questions that might invite me for a more detailed, personal screening.  As a frequent flyer who gets pulled out a lot to do special screenings (being a middle aged guy with just carry on and short hair does seem like a logical demographic to pay a little extra attention to), I don't want to incentivize even more attention given generally tight schedules, but I am now careful to check my pockets and briefcase to ensure that I am not accidentially carrying this device with me for travel.OK, why not four or five stars?The very first time I plugged this into my computer to check out the photos and video quality, I had a significantly disturbing message come up from my anti-virus program saying that there was a \"key-logger like\" program being installed.  I tried to abort, but it was too quick for me.  Since that time, my computer has run very slowly.I did a detailed scan of the device, but I don't have the assets to scan the USB bios.Indy, I have a bad feeling about this.I have taken to leaving that system isolated from the rest of my network for fear that there is a Trojan just waiting to blast PII or worse to someone across the Pacific, and I cannot think of any legitimate reasons for that.So, it is useful, but I would be very wary of this device.  If you have an older, stand alone computer that is already sanitized then you can probably use it with a clear conscience, but I would not use it on a computer that I use for business or on-line account management or buying.(You could probably safely either transmit data-only files to a safe, neutral, on-line site for uploading or burn the data-only files onto a CD, but I would never, ever, ever use a USB device to tranfer data from the computer with this device on it.)If I were sure about it, I would give it one star or even report this to Amazon.  As it is, there is just one too many coincidences with the warning and the glacial slow-down in processing speed on the computer.  Fortunately, it was time for me to to upgrade to a faster machine anyway.Like a chainsaw, this product could be very useful as long as you are aware of and plan for the risks.In service,RichThe Original Dr. Games since 1993", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy to use", "Author": "Mi55y", "ReviewID": "R9MJFDSYNO7W6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works well and easily to video myself at work to show my family and friends what a typical day at work for me is like.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "goo video", "Author": "Roberto Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R28HS0NOBUCVRI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It said that records up to 3 hours but records up to 1 and 1/2 hours. easy to work it.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product for Video", "Author": "Birdie", "ReviewID": "R3ATZYBRFAEOMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was extremely happy with the quality of the picture.

Schneider \"john_jps\"", "ReviewID": "ROIQG16MDC504", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an interesting little device that is, unfortunately, more of a cool toy than something you would actually want to take into a covert situation.What you get: the pen, 3 ink refills, and a short USB connector cable.  If you plug into a USB port on your PC, it shows up like any jump drive, with folders for pictures and video, as well as small executable.  Run the executable and it generates a few text files that allow the pen to reset the date/time (based on your computer's date/time); this way your photos and videos will have the correct timestamp.  You should do this before you start taking a bunch of photos/video.Photo quality is merely OK, 1280x1024 pixels and requiring an extremely steady hand to get crisp results.  Video quality in terms of crispness is actually better than photo quality, but video resolution is only 640x480 pixels.  For both photo and video, colors are extremely dull: this is not a cell phone camera much less a dedicated camera.  Video is silent (no audio) so it is not a substitute for any kind of video camera either.  There are no settings or adjustments you can make in terms of photo or video quality (e.g. inside/outside or near/far, etc.)The biggest positive for me is that with 4GB of storage, this actually makes for a decent, albeit spendy, little jump drive.The biggest downfall to me is that it simply isn't very covert at all.  The thing has an easily visible amber light when in standby, which changes to blue when recording video or storing a photo.  This light is on the back of the pen so could conceivably be hidden if the pen is tight against your chest, but who would want to risk that in an actual covert situation? Granted, you could cover it with electrical tape or something but (a) that would look stupid, and (b) you could lose track of whether or not you're recording.

The shutter is operated with a button on the top of the pen, which has a small hole above the clip through which images are captured.  To stop video recording, you press the shutter again.  It claims to hold three hours of video and 100,00 photos on a 4GB USB drive.  You can unscrew the pen to reveal the drive, which works just like a typical flash drive (and could be used as one). When you plug the drive into your computer, a box will pop up showing the files, which you can then view, delete, etc.  The device charges through its USB connection.  The battery supposedly will allow an hour of video recording on a charge.The images of both the photos and the video are reasonably clear and decent, considering the size of the device and the cost, although neither is of very high quality--you wouldn't want to use this in lieu of a cell phone camera, let alone a dedicated camera, if quality is a priority. But if you have a use for a pen-shaped camera, it does the job.Keep in mind that the video is silent; it appears that sound recording is subject to legal restrictions that silent filming may not be.  So you have to ask yourself how much use you might have for such a device.  Taking photos or video with a cell phone gives superior results--and sound--and can be done relatively unobtrusively, so you really would have to want to record silent images in an environment where the subject doesn't want to be recorded.Considering that the shutter is triggered by pressing a button on top of the pen, there may be a limit as to how may times you can do that without your subject wondering why you keep pressing the top of your pen as it sits in your breast pocket.  You may wonder why you can't simply hold the pen in your hand and snap pictures that way, greatly reducing the likelihood of being noticed.  In theory, you can--but you'll have to guess whether your subject is being captured through the pinhole, since there's no way to aim it.  At least if it's sitting in your breast pocket you can assume it's capturing something that's directly in front of you.  With video, it's a little simpler, since you only have to press the button once and it will record until you press it again.)In summary, this would be of value to a narrow market that really needs to take images covertly; otherwise, it's a clever toy that is best used as an expensive flash drive.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fun but not so much functional", "Author": "Kassa", "ReviewID": "R2KURLVX1QIPNH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this pen camera more for the fun factor than trying to spy on someone and that's a good thing as it's definitely not suited to legitimate discreet needs.
