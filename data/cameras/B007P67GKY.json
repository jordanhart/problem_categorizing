{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Harinezumi 3  - it's not perfect but it isn't meant to be", "Author": "Mr C J Pigott", "ReviewID": "R1L1CT8J3QSP6V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a cool little camera.It is easy to operate and the pictures created are more or less as expected: extremely lo-fi and I think it is fair to say they are very 'Lomo-like' (and hopefully I am not offending any Lomo purists by saying that).If you want a fun camera that is the complete opposite to the high tech of normal digital cameras then get this little star. Buy it with your eyes open and you won't be disappointed. It allows you to be creative without getting bogged with any technical issues.Remember though you will need to buy the microSD and battery separately. It would also be worth getting a lanyard for it.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007P67GKY"}}
