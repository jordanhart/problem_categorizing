I gave it to her early so that she may use it during the holidays to take pictures of the family. This was a great purchase since she fell in love with it right away. She even created a Flickr account to upload the pictures.The camera is really easy to use and she has a hard time with technology. The picture quality is really good and with all of the sharing options available it makes the whole family look at the pictures. I'm so thankful that I bought this camera over others and with the carrying case and SD card in the box it makes this bundle a great buy.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "A Reader", "ReviewID": "RTABRC1LIWMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.  It is just the right size to slip into purse or pocket.  It takes great pictures with auto focus which are bright and easily viewable on the 3 inch screen.  I've had more advanced cameras in the past, but this time I wanted a point-and-shoot camera which I could use on my walks without the bulk of a big camera and accessory bag.  I am really surprised at the quality of the pictures with this little camera.  I was so impressed, I got another one for my grandson, for his first camera.  One thing I will miss is the viewfinder from my previous Kodak Z740.  Please note this camera doesn't have any internal memory and an SC card has to be inserted to take pictures.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little Camera!", "Author": "Stephanie A Becerra", "ReviewID": "R1IUFBLVBRYJXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera!

It doesn't do well with action shots, it's pretty slow on regular shots (\"take the picture already!\"), or low lighting. And when I decided to use the Kodak software to transfer my pics and videos I lost all my videos in the transfer process. Not happy about that. Good to use at the zoo, maybe, or Christmas morning, but don't take it to the ball game or your daughter's 10th birthday party!", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "absolutely love it!!!!", "Author": "wldbutterfly24", "ReviewID": "RSN8C3CHIU1DV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i absolutely love this camera was so happy when i got it.  takes wonderful pics of the kids!!!!!

I was hoping to find the right balance between ease of use and reasonable cost.  The Susan G. Komen Limited Edition bundle that included a pink bag, a memory card, and the Kodak name seemed to be a terrific deal.The camera did work out of the box and the buttons and menus seemed easy enough, but after one picture, subsequent pictures displayed nothing but noise and when turning off the camera, a message saying the that the 'lens obstructed' appeared.Other websites indicate that this type of error is somewhat common for many brands of cameras, especially if small particles of debris gets caught in the lens as it is trying to extend/retract. A possible culprit is particles from inside a camera case.  The case in this instance is leather though I didn't inspect it closely before storing the camera.  It is very snug though.There are several sites with troubleshooting tips for this type of problem, but none of the ideas resolved this particular problem. The camera was purchased through a merchant on the Amazon Marketplace and I assumed it was new, but perhaps it was refurbished.  The opinion on the Internet seems to be that trying get warranty repair done isn't worth the effort, after all it is only a $60 camera.So I'm heading to Sam's Club and will pick up an Canon A-series for her and pay the extra $5 to cover the camera for the first year.  I had a early model Canon point-and-shoot and sustained several drops and kept on working, so hopefully Canon's manufacturing standards are still strong today.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broken!", "Author": "Jess", "ReviewID": "R1GYWNJMYPAQAD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this camera for 2 days and it stopped working ridiculous!I will never buy another camera from here", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Delivery time", "Author": "Oscar Kirzner", "ReviewID": "R3NZNT3SXMWFFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this item on Thursday, March 22, 2012.  It was supposed to be delivered sometime from March 28 to April 1, 2012.  But noooooo!  It was delivered via USPS on Saturday, March 24, 2012.  Am I upset by the early delivery?  Is the bear Catholic? Does the wild ecclesiastic go potty in the woods? I was quite pleased.  Unfortunately, no charitable contribution will be made because the item was purchased after Dec. 31, 2011.  Also, software must be downloaded to pull the pictures off the camera and the memory card cannot be accessed directly via this model (unlike the C513 that it replaced).  However, it is still a great deal for the camera, carrying case, & 4gb SD card.  I may simply get a cheap USB card reader to access the SD card.I'll give it a 9 out of 10 rating.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible!", "Author": "Mommyz", "ReviewID": "R90R9XKFCHH1T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very cheap camera, DO NOT BUY!

Well, I didn't take it back because customer opened it, put the separately bought memory card and threw the packages away. Even though, I had my receipt and they could see I only had it one day, they would not return any of my money at Target.Well next, I tried buying yet another poloroid (different one) and took a chance because it was refurbished (which I thought means fixed) from a company named \"Outlet\" through Amazon and guess what? I just gave a review for that camera but, the power button and shutter would not work properly. I bought the refurbished camera because I already lost money at Target on the 1st one. So this 2nd one went back. I was pretty frustrated by this time, and just decided to spend a little more and get a new camera. I always feel more comfortable just buying from Amazon or Fullfilled by Amazon because I have never really encountered any real problem with them directly. Anyhow, to get to the point; Amazon apparently sent my package out early as usually and I just started getting texts on where my packages are and when to be delivery exactly. But, my package after days of waiting to make sure of what happened was misdelivered. So I never got this camera I so badly wanted, but it was a Post Office mistake, not Amazons.They usually say 3 times a charm and it wasn't, but of course, Amazon immediately and happily took care of my problem. It looks like I am going to give the search for a camera a break for a while because this has just been to drug out, through no fault of anyone really except this last try the Post Office messed up. So if you wanted this camera, I say go for it, I love the features that come with it. I think my luck for some reason was just on the outs.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wrong Camera", "Author": "pattypete", "ReviewID": "R1F8L4YM8R3AHM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We received a camera and case but it was not the Susan G Komen limited addition.
