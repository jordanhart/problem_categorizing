{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon EOS 5D Mark III Camera", "Author": "FireSpirit Designs", "ReviewID": "R1R0N5LL8NMV9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got a chance to really use this camera in the past couple of weeks & I'm really impressed with it, especially the HDR setting! Talk about detail! I still have a lot to learn with this camera, especially because I normally use Olympus E series cameras, which I do find a little more user friendly. But, this one comes with a very detailed manual, which will help tremendously. This is my 1st Canon camera & I bought it mainly because I wanted a full frame camera with HDR capabilities. This camera is amazing and you can't go wrong buying it. I really hesitated to spend that much money on a camera, but in the end decided to go for it. This will be a great addition to my Olympus cameras because it allows me to do things I can't with my Olympus. Canon has a winner with this new camera in their line & I'm going to enjoy learning how to really make it work for me. If you're an advanced amateur or a professional, this will be a great addition to your tools! What a great early Christmas gift to myself! :)", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$3,999.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS 5D Mark III Digital SLR Camera with EF 24-105mm L IS USM Lens + <2> Canon 200EG DSLR Camera Case + <3> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card +\n<4> Spare LP-E6 Battery + <5> Battery Charger for LP-E6 + <6> Zeikos BG-E11 Battery Grip + <7> 77mm 3pc (UV/FLD/CPL) Filter +\n<8> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control + <9> Canon Optical Cleaning Kit + <10> PD Spudz Microfiber Cloth + <11> PD Deluxe Hurricane Blower +\n<12> HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable + <13> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <14> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <15> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Canon EOS 5D Mark III Digital SLR Camera with EF 24-105mm L IS USM Lens with 64GB Card + Battery & Charger + Grip + Backpack Case + 3 Filters + HDMI Cable + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JTCawZx3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CSTHCAM"}}
