It is a very good kit lens and a great lens to learn on.  This lens will take any photographer a long way.  Just note that in poor lighting conditions a flash will be necessary.  I am debating replacing this lens with a 17-35mm f2.8.  I am not sure that 1 - 2 f-stops will buy me much.This is my trusted and true lens.  I only took two lenses to Hawaii, this one and my 70-300mm (non-VR version).  That is all I needed.  Both lenses handled the trip well.  For outdoor photography, the 18-70 is a champ.  In tight quarters, with the pop-up flash, this lens will provide some great imagery.  I used this lens to photograph an indoor corporate event but it required an external flash. I have the SB-600 and this lens provides the required information to the flash to properly adjust the flash intensity.", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon 18mm - 70mm", "Author": "G.
