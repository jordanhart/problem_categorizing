{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Intova 880K A great system for the money!", "Author": "d.a.v.e", "ReviewID": "R1XUTXIV911BPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this for a recent trip to Hawaii & it turned out to be a great little underwater camera set up.  I used the camera without housing for snorkeling trips and did 4 dives going as deep as 70ft with the camera in the housing with no leaks!This is a very nice underwater camera set up for the money.  Looking at it I am reminded of last years Olympis underwater camera & I suspect much of the internals would match up to that system from what I have seen?  I have been a professional photographer & I still own and use several pro level DSLR's.  While this camera does not compare to a great pro level lens, underwater housing, & body you can still take nice underwater pictures & the video feature turned out to be one of my favorites.  The camera did very well with white balance & if you could follow your subject a bit there was little issue with the shutter delay.I would recommend this setup to anyone interested in experimenting with an underwater camera!", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Okay in shallow water, but not good for diving", "Author": "Scott McClure", "ReviewID": "R7L2GH8J5EVQ9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When it comes to underwater cameras, you really get what you pay for.  For $279, you don't get much - especially from this camera.If you just want to take snapshots or video clips while snorkeling or in the pool, you might be okay with this camera.  If you are a SCUBA diver, forget it.  I've dug through the menus, tweaked settings, and I still get garbage most of the time.  I took it to Hawaii over the holidays, and shot quite a few photos and some video in water with 100+ foot visibility.  Most of the pictures were poor quality.  The video was better than the stills.Major drawbacks:1.  Buttons on case are all black, except for the \"Select\" button, which is silver.  There are icons molded into the buttons, which become nearly invisible once you descend below 20 feet or so, depending on conditions.  You have to memorize the functions of at least 6 buttons.2.  Flash is next to useless in the underwater housing in low-light conditions.  Despite multiple attempts to ensure that the camera was seated properly in the housing, the flash somehow bleeds over and blows out one side of the picture.3.  Menu structure is quirky and confusing.4.  Despite extensive experimentation with various settings, it generally produces crap pictures, except on the surface, or in a well-lit swimming pool.I also have a Canon D10, which although limited to 33 fsw for diving, produces far better results, for about the same money.  If they made a case that allowed me to take it to 130 fsw, I'd use it instead, and use the Intova to hammer in tent stakes.In short, this thing was apparently designed by a bunch of stoned monkeys that just wanted to make a fast buck with the least amount of effort.
