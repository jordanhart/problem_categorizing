I chose it for my daughter because it was so 'girly', however, there isn't anything else good about the camera.  The screen to view the images on is misrepresented on the picture on the back of the package; in reality is is smaller than a postage stamp.  Also, the screen has such lousy resolution you can hardly tell what you're taking a picture of.  On a side note:the camera won't work if we use rechargeable batteries.I bought my son a VTech camera, which looks a little baby-ish, but is a much better camera, even for my 8 year old daughter.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$44.00", "Features": "Digital Camera Takes Up To 152 Pictures Without Film\nDownload Pictures Directly From Computer\nPreview Screen To View Pictures\nPersonalize Digital Camera With Changing Faceplates", "Name": "DIGITAL CONCEPTS 27597 VGA Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511vtpbWrsL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0017I700C"}}
