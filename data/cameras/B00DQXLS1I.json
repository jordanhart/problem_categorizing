{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My 1st Mid Range DSLR", "Author": "Mohammed B Siraj", "ReviewID": "R1ECI5FBCD2S4B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It has been 4 weeks since I got hold of my D70. I am an old Canon fan boy (using an A1 in the 80s), so it was nice to get that feel of the camera back. The camera functioned very nicely taking great pictures on the fast mode A+ and I especially liked the creative CA mode experimenting with the Vividness, softness, warmness, and other settings. I was looking forward to the WiFi capabilities, but was disappointed with the functionality as I expected a more mature interface allowing uploading to online services directly from the camera. In addition no guideline on which App on the iTunes store would work with this model (BTW it is EOS Remote App from Canon). I would not have purchased the bundle for either the bag nor for the memory card. The bag isn't that great, and the memory card is a Sony that failed my son with his Sony NX3 and I gave it a low review. The lens is the perfect range from a wide angle to a decent zoom, although I was not allowed to take it with me at the Hokey game in Vancouver and had to leave it with customer service.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DQXLS1I"}}
