This camera has a very nice picture but the viewing area is smaller then the CV-31. The only complaint I have is the connections are different then my old one so I had to pull out my old cables and route in the ones which came with it.Oh, and the power supply with this one actually works, thank you for that! The power supplies which came with the CV-31 were garbage, the one which came with it didn't work at all, and the replacement worked for about a week.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Construction - Sub-Par Image Quality", "Author": "Smedsters", "ReviewID": "R2FECNVWTJNJ4Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This SVAT VU500-C Hi-Res camera is made extremely well.  I have no complaints about the construction other than it would have been nice to have the ability to affix the mounting bracket to the top of the camera and not only the bottom.  As for the picture quality, there are much better cameras out there that produce clearer images for not much more in price.  Not sure why this is named \"Hi-Res\" when I don't see anything Hi-Resolution about it in picture quality.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfied", "Author": "teo man \"oaa\"", "ReviewID": "R17DJFZ5Z4IOI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a VU-301C. This is much better than a VU-301C. First of all the mount is much more robust and easier to set up. The performance of the camera is very satisfactory both day and night given the price. As a result, I was able to keep some trouble away.
