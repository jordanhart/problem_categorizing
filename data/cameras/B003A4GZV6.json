I like the camera. I have small hands so it fits perfectly in my hands. Plus it's not an overly expensive camera. It's not meant to be a professionals' camera. Focus is a bit blah but I don't expect it to be entirely awesome. Picture quaility is pretty decent. If you're new to digital cameras, like lcd large view screens to view pictures, this is a good camera. If you're after professional quailty of the $300 quality or whatever, this may not be for you.at the moment, my battery isn't holding but it's not the fault of the camera...That's my fault... XD word of warning: keep ahold of the camera's actual charger with you!", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awful purchase!!!!!!!", "Author": "ALBL", "ReviewID": "R39EKF87Z1PEZT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera just to get by since I broke my last one and can't get one that big just yet. The features sound great for this Cobra, but when I got the camera and started playing with it, I was very disappointed! The viewing screen is very fuzzy and dark, I can hardly see it. The camera is very small and difficult to push the tiny buttons. The flash doesn't automatically come on, you have to reset that every time you turn it on. When it DOES flash, it whites on the picture so bad, you can't even see the image. The images are usually grainy and dark, hard to see, and blurry no matter what setting I use. I can get better pictures on my Rumor2 cellphone!!! This will get me by until I can get the camera I really want and then it's going to my husband to take hunting because I don't care if it gets ruined...it's the worst camera I've ever used!!!!", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$129.95", "Features": "12 megapixel\n8x digital zoom\n2.4\" color LTPS LCD screen\nVideo record function\nTV output", "Name": "COBRA DIGITAL DCA1220-BLACK 12.0 Megapixel DCA1220 Digital Camera (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51U87J3rtnL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003A4GZV6"}}
