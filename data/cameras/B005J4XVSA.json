{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon EOS 60D SLR", "Author": "B. Willnecker", "ReviewID": "RUESSLL8V9J0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has everything for which I was looking and has been a pleasure to use:1) Reasonably weighted (some may prefer the more expensive EOS 7D's magnesium-alloy body, body this one works fine for me)2) 5+ FPS, perfect for shooting the kids' sports events3) Built-in flash for times when it is not convenient to use a shoe flash4) SD support-- unifying memory card support in the household is important. The EOS 7D uses Compact Flash, which is great if you you have it or do not mind carrying multiple card types5)Support for my old EOS lenses. Yes, my 23-year-old EOS lenses still work (I did buy new, lighter lenses, but it is good to know I have backup)6) Interface similar to my old EOS 620, including the top LCD for quickly changing ISO, drive mode, etc. (EOS Rebels do not have this from what I have seen)7) Articulating LCD that can turn around so that my face does not press against the glass when shooting. This is similar to that screen on the Gx series, which is a good thing for me.Sure, some negatives may exist, but I am just delighted with the camera and do not want to dwell on them. Other reviewers have pointed out the negatives.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "5 stars , despite some details", "Author": "gb", "ReviewID": "R3Q5GP0PYW9ZDH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great kit, great price. It cames with everything you'll need for taking amazing pictures. THe accesories are nice but there are some things that are not as shown in the picture. This is the tripod, wich quality is poor- it is not a zeikos, but a vivitar- the brand is not important for me but the model is not as good as that in the picture. Also the bag is not the one shown in the picture -that is a lowe pro, of a much more better quality than the one I recieved , wich is a zeikos, but it does the job. It is small, but everything in this pack fits in it. The flash was of a better quality than that in the picture.Some things didn't arrive (the travel charger). I'm not going to ask for it beacause I have one already and i'm not living in the USA (I got the kit thanks to a relative there) so it would be a problem to ask for something I don't actually need. I read in other reviews that if there's something left they send it to you without a problem. So if anybody finds that somethig's not been sent, that shouldn't be a problem I guess...It came on time. But the seller didn't answer to my inquiries - I emailed them twice, the first time they didn't answer so I did it a second one, and the answer was short and not helpfulDespite all that, the kit is super nice so it is worht the 5 stars. Very good for anyone trying to go a little further in photography, like me.If you use free software as i do, like linux, you'll have to find  the way to install the software of the camera, cause it is only for mac and pc; i'm trying to do this with WinE but I haven't installed it succesfully so far", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Service", "Author": "kuttamum", "ReviewID": "R2HUGJ0X78BRE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I live in India and could not find the set or price here. So I ordered this set from Sunset Electronics. I am incredibly happy with the purchase. I am still learning how to use the camera and all the lenses, but the pictures are fantastic and when played on an IPAD are GORGEOUS!I want to thank the company as they were outstanding in customer service. I worked with Eric on having the item shipped 2 day to India because of an upcoming trip I was taking. Item was received and in great condition. Unfortunately the main lens was missing from the set and when I contacted Eric he shipped it next day to the hotel I was going to be staying at in China. They covered the shipping and customs fees for the mistake.I highly recommend the product, but more so the company for being understanding and helpful especially working with an international customer.THANKS!", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Package is Good but with points to be addressed", "Author": "Anjani", "ReviewID": "R36GZIR2C0C6XK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from 33 street camera around 1 month back. the Overall experience was nice. the flash was missing in my shipment but when i called to them they promptly send with no issues and really the flash is awesome.Anyway the only one drawback which i found is the tripod which is a terrible one. the tripod is very very cheap and the tripod i received is faulty. it is not capable of holding even my digital camera Nikon p510. i suggest to exclude the tripod and include a remote shutter release device.instead of that the package is very good. all other stuff is good quality and the most important point is you will need those item in future. so why not buy them in a package. my overall experience was good and i recommend this to others", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "EOS 60D", "Author": "Javier Reynoso Garcia", "ReviewID": "RHL9DJ36GEP4K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for taking HD video.

This  is a  perfeect starter kit. It came with everything that promised. Carry big is a fanatastic addition to kit.  Whole box of stuff fits in that bag . Lens are brand new and working great. I tried 3 shoots  with this new puppy, especially  wild animal park. 55-250 lens caught the animals very far resting under trees superbly.I can't be more happier . Although 18-200 would be a good addition in place of 18-55 . Reason for that is changing lens is  an issue if you are outside. sensor might get dusty.
