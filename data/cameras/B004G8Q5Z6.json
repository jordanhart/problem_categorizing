Have hardly had to refer to the manual as it is very intuitive and user friendly.  It is very easy to transfer photos to a computer for printing.  The pictures are much clear and sharper that I have found on similar size cameras.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Picture quality .!", "Author": "Tyrone B. Stacey \"SERIOUS7\"", "ReviewID": "R2G9KXEJPJ30WA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I remember taking this camera down to a place called Dumbo in Brooklyn NY to get shots of lower Manhattan across the East river in the area of where the old WTC use to be..There's a mode on this camera called \" ADV.\" and in there is a \"Pro Low light\" section that's great.  I'm not a pro but taking shots in the dark made me feel like a pro .. I could not believe the clarity in the pitch black night that i was getting,just incredible ..!As dark as the Museum of Natural History is,and at 12:30am in Coney Island the pictures shot in the same mode were just fantastic..In the day light,pictures taken in the flower garden are just jaw dropping.. I love to take pictures with guys who have much more expensive cameras than mine and then compare the same shot, sometimes its just embarrassing .. Then the real test is when i put my pictures on my laptop, sometimes i just stare at the shots with a smile on my face shaking my head,lol..All i'm saying, if you have a little experience with cameras this camera will not let you down..I wish i could post my desk top photo on this site of a American Indian PoW WoW that i took some years ago..", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "I would recommend.", "Author": "AKA Jamm100 \"jamm100\"", "ReviewID": "R3V40SI44S92IN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good camera for the the price range.
