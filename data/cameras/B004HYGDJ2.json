Cheaper cameras give you better quality, Kodak, Canon, Sony, Olympus, Pentax, Samsung, Panasonic, GE, Fuji.This Casio gave me the worst quality images and video among the brands I mentioned.No more Casio cameras for me, I'll just purchase watches or calculators from Casio.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sample of the video recording quality and quick impressions", "Author": "W. Taylor", "ReviewID": "RN3Q7RCZ0YRBH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here is an example of the video recording in various situations.  The only other digital video recorder I've used was an older generation Exilim (7 MP model) and a really crappy cell phone from like 6 years ago so I'm not really sure how it stacks up compared to other products like digital cameras and Flip-type camcorders.Sample footage - [...].  Information about transcoding and the camera settings are inside the link.The photography aspects seem on par with what I'd expect out of a camera, although the manual focus leaves much to be desired.  The still image quality is really good when you resize 14.1MP images to something in the area of 720p or lower.  At it's normal 14.1 MP resolution the images are grainy with a lot of noise and speckles.  To be fair though, this camera is pretty cheap in price so maybe that's to be expected.  Plus, if you really need huge images (like 4000x3000) to look great, you're probably going to go for a better camera.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "ligh nice easy to use camera, BAD pictures quality too bad", "Author": "HHetze", "ReviewID": "R2M4GY79MPVUHF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "it is a NICE easy to use camera the battery lasts forever, too bad that Casio did not put more efforts into the pictures quality, they are BAD.
