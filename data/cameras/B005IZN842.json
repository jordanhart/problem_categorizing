You have to open the flash by pulling it up and then wait for it to charge. This can take some time and you have to wait after each photo for the flash before taking another photo.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Robert G. Allen", "ReviewID": "R13I9RYDWIDNU3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a professional photographer for 20 years, using much larger cameras.  Retired now, wanted something small to carry on trips, but didn't want to sacrifice features.  This camera has it!!  It will do a lot more and takes better pictures than my old Canon SLR.  I'm still discovering some of the things this camera will do.  I highly recommend it.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera!", "Author": "TES", "ReviewID": "R2AZ75K6ZARDHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm no expert, Ive owned a few digital cameras but that's it so I don't know all the technical mumbo jumbo? I bought this to go to Maui, took it out of the box, put batteries in it, set to auto and start clicking. Worked great, I think the pictures were crisp, clear and overall were wonderful. I can say a few people I know that do know all the mumbo jumbo looked at our pictures and said \"wow! what kind of camera do you have, these are great!\" Whatever? I just took pictures, the camera did all the work.I'm kinda a nerd so I played with the different settings, does all kinds of stuff and its not hard to navigate the menu, kinda dumb guy proof. Works for me. If you can program a DVR you'll do just fine.It comes with a good case, memory card and cleaning kit.

Great picture quality, awesome features, great price. The only thing I did not like about this package deal was the carrying case, it is good for storing the camera at home, but I will have to buy another case for travel, I prefer one with pockets and a better ability to secure the camera inside, in case of unexpected movements or trips, the price was the same with package deal or not so I took a chance, not unhappy with having the memory disk, made getting to know the camera easier sense it would not have come with one otherwise. Comes with batteries, I am not sure yet if this a good thing or not, some say it is not, but could not find out another way to go, for the most part I am happy with the camera.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy To Use - Great Pictures", "Author": "Sandy", "ReviewID": "RG2TQPNPT0WBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second camera like this I purchased.  My niece was so impressed with it, I gaveher mine and purchased another....my other one was 12x zoom, this one 16x.  They bothtake terrific pictures...really, color, clarity, etc.  Why I also purchased this is because it uses2 AA batteries.  These batteries last a long time.....love the fact that you don't have to recharge,so if you are anywhere out of town or about, you always have a running camera.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "J.
