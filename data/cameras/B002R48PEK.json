Nadeem", "ReviewID": "R3K8YTWTEZPCQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:* A good reason to install, where you cannot run cables.* Can access remotely.* Can record video on remote location.* Motion Activated* Infra red option shows real good picture even in complete darkness.* Can install more than one camera and can view them at the same page. (integrated)* Can move camera remotely or from your handheld device.* Good camera in this priceCons:* You need a strong wireless signal (at least good) for this to work properly, will not work properly in low signal strength. Will work but will disappear from the network after some time.* These devices are made in China are terribly incompatible with Internet Explorer. The active X control used to view video is not digitally signed and even if you allow active x and Add ones to be installed on your computer it gives you real hard time to view the video. Tech support is unable to answer this question. However works fine in Mozilla Firefox but most of the features are disable in fire fox and can only be achieved through internet explorer.* Field of view is another issue. It only covers some area where it is installed and the lens inside is 3.8mm which is not a wide angle. You need to buy 2.8mm wide angle to cover more area, which will cost you around 8-12 additional dollars.* Motion activated feature can only email you or if you are using FTP will allow you to upload pictures only not the video.* If you are using multiple access points in an area it should be configured with the right access point (by using its MAC address.In short these devices are at their beginning stages and needs some time to get into a good shape (hardware and software). These devices are good for a small home or office but are not good at commercial level. I tried installing it in a commercial organization but end up with wasting time and money. If this camera and its brother the outdoor Wi-Fi Camera is improved for signal strength reliability and consistency with software for Microsoft Windows then it will be a good choice to install.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "OK - I guess", "Author": "Paul Langner", "ReviewID": "R1JNF65VBK591S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as it appeared very similar to the Trendnet IP422W.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of drawbacks:1) When connected to the network, there is a white LED on the front that continuously flashes, and there is no way to shut it off2) Alarm events that trigger writing a video record to disk require a PC to be running firmware on it, and connected to the camera in order for this to occur.  Autonomous operation writing events to a network drive are not possible.Incidentally, this camera appears to be a BA-J011 made by BND Creative in Shenzhen[...]", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "This price is ridiculous for starters.", "Author": "S. Lynn", "ReviewID": "RQCKKGA7WVJJR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Seriously? I paid 65 bucks each for 3 of these.Seriously though, these are made in china and it shows. ESPECIALLY in the instruction manual. It's pretty much garbage. It gets the point across, but some of it is just silly trying to decode what they are attempting to communicate.I also have absolutely NO clue why I can't get it to show the feed on any apple products. I have tried everything I can think of from forwarding specific parts to messing with DHCP settings and configuring every bit of anything I can in my router. There is just no hope. It will NOT feed to my ipad or iphone. I've pretty much given up and will be looking for something else to use. It was a good try for 60 bucks, but in the ned, not even worth that really since it won't feed to the devices I want it to.I wouldn't pay this price for them if i was being held at gunpoint.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Caution Not easy to setup outside your home.", "Author": "Mitch Vass \"Mitch Vass Sandy ego Ca.\"", "ReviewID": "R3AK1VR3XILZPB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the camerar overall.I am changing my view on this camera to very good. After I making and error in the set up. My caution and frustration is I bought Ip Camera so I could viw my house and rooms from offsite location.Caution you will go through hell trying to configure these.  if your Internet supplier blocks your port 80, have to configure router, pass through ports, and on and onInternelly they are great, good price. Although I have now viewed my house from the internet outside, and I bought four of these cameras thinking it was what I wanted. I will post back after my failed endless hours plus hours of trying and reading about this proceedure to get the cam to work on WAN. I have the understanding now.After hiring a compuer guy He fixed me up and now it is fairly simple.others.................. You cannot just log into your home network and view your home or office. Not on cox anyway.Frustrated to the max MitchThey will work with cox but they were worthless for any help.The trick is to set an ip adress and a port for each of the cameras.Then forward the same ip and ports in your router.I am really pleased now with this camera. Especially for the price and not having to pay for a service.It is tricky at first on IE you have to allow active x controls , unsigned active x controls and initialize scipt and active x conrrols not marked safe. Three setting. If you mark one of them ok to use previously used active x, then you can put your internet settings back to default for you internet safety.I am pleased with this camera fter a bit of frustration but I am not the coputer geek for networking that I thought I am.Enjoy the day.", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not a Foscam Camera!", "Author": "Glenn", "ReviewID": "R1R0ELKT5WCAXL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you think this is a Foscam camera it is not!!  Crashed my camera on the first day I had it, because I updated to Foscam's firmware.  While it still works, it is not going to update well, and is probably not as good in quality in general as Foscam's real version.Foscam's real version on their website cam be found here: [...]From what I can see they do not sell directly, so you will have to purchase it through Amazon or some other website that they use.Search:  \"Foscam\" on Amazon in order to find the real Foscam camera.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Item for the money for sure... FIVE STARS (AT LEAST!!)", "Author": "C. M. Simpson \"xCalibur50\"", "ReviewID": "R3HLOCSLS32R49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These cameras simply, ROCK!  For the price (I got mine on ebay for less then $90.00!  I now have several and love them more and more everyday!  Easy to add to your network with the great tools that come on the CD that's included with the camera.ONE QUESTION I have that NOBODY can seem to answer is this:WHO IN THE HELL IS THE MANUFACTURER of these AWESOME devices??  WHY aren't they branded in ANY way at all?  There are several model numbers out there and none of them resemble each other.  It's as if they were found on the moon magically and several people brought some back to earth and said... AWESOME IP camera for sale, CHEAP!IF ANYone knows who manufactured these... I would LOVE to know as I would LOVE to see if there is a firmware update available or even if there is an embedded web UI update available.  I would even simply take a link to where I might be able to find these updates without even knowing who the company manufacturer is... I won't tell ANYone else... I promise.In summary... this camera really does do all it says and more.  The picture quality is INCREDIBLE... the audio output, UNREAL... it just the best deal I've ever come across for electronic devices such as these.  I'll soon have 8 of them all around inside and out of my house and office.  If you come to my house or office... I WILL have your picture on my phone within 50 seconds as thats how long it takes to send me a picture when motion is detected.  Very few false alarms also.... I'll stop now...These things are just plain bad ASS!  Thank you whoever the company name is who manufacturers these bad boys!  You should really be asking more for them as you WOULD get it.... hell... I WOULD have paid double what I did had I known how sweet these things work and well.
