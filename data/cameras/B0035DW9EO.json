I am very happy and will buy this cable any time I need a replacement in the future.

The cable came with two BNC male-to-male adapters and a short (a few inches) power extension cable which I thought was a nice unexpected plus. The wires are very thin that I have to be extra careful in running the cable so as not to stress it and cause a break in the cable.After completing the installation, I had no video signal. I check every details and found that the cable had an intermittent short in the video cable next to the stress relief junction on the camera end. I decided to just repair it since I am an Electrical Engineer. After connecting the cable again, there was still no video so after another hour of troubleshooting found. I threw it as I can't waste my time any more.
