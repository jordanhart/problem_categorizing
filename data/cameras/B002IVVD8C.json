The photos so far are relatively sharp (increasing the sharpness in P mode helps even more) and the colors are great. The ergonomics of the camera are well thought out and the build quality is solid.Having used small Kodak Cameras for the last few years (v550, v705 & m1033) this is a larger camera. That said, I think that the 10x Zoom will be a nice feature and make the size increase over the pocket cameras worth it.Shot to Shot performance is a bit on the sluggish side, but not too big of a deal. Shutter lag is very quick and is helpful for catching quick photos since we have a little baby that moves around a lot!It would have been nice to make the camera Dock compatible, but we can live with plugging it into the iMac with the USB to transfer photos and charge the battery.Overall I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars (not 5 stars due to the speed between photos and time to clear the buffer when shooting continuously).I would definitely recommend this camera!", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Alice Hess \"obplayer\"", "ReviewID": "RHBSGFAWUCNN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed an easy to use camera that takes sharp pictures and video.

I can say that I am really satisfied with it. I had another Kodak that was five years old and it is still working.  I just wanted to buy another one that had a higher zoom and more mepapixels.  This camera has different picture modes that I don't know how to use like the pasm, but when you are switching between each one a message shows up in the screen giving a simple explanation of what that option is used for. I love the big screen, the video and picture quality is excellent.  I like that while I'm taking a video I can zoom in and zoom out.  Although while zooming the scene becomes a little blurred.  The optical zoom is 10X and you can see things very far away and the resolution is still great.  The battery lasts a long time.  I think that in two months I have charged it twice.  I would recommend this product to anybody looking to buy a camera.  One feature that I really like is that if you erase a video or photo by mistake you can recover it.  This only works for the last erased picture or photo, but believe me, it is great to have this feature.  The size of the camera is not as small as I would like it to be, but usually the smaller cameras in the market have less resolution and the zoom is not as good.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Color, quality at a reasonable price!", "Author": "AMD \"AMD\"", "ReviewID": "R218CSFQ9Z2UXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We take a LOT of photos.  {6000 photos plus per year}  If you're looking for a easy to use, well made, excellent zoom, with the BEST color quality of any camera out there in this price range, you won't find a better camera.

The image stabilization requirement helped filter my choices a little as I have some hand tremor. Personally I like Kodak cameras. I had a Kodak Z740 that I used for years totally happy. But the Z950 really is amazing considering the on-board features in addition to optical image stabilization: digital red eye removal, video trimming, cropping of stills, on board help, multiple selection of pictures, the list goes on and on. For the price, I don't know how Kodak does it. The lens and zoom range are great. The manual that comes with the camera is seriously weak but you can download the pdf version of the \"extended\" user manual which is very complete. Just study this manual to find and use all the features. Navigation through the various menus is easy and fairly thoughtfully designed to be user friendly despite the plethora of options. I also use the camera at school as I am a high school science teacher and the digital video clips are great for capturing scenes that can then be analyzed using Video Point software. The video trimming capability is really helpful for using the clips with Video Point. High definition video helps here too. The bang for this camera is not in its looks, which are fairly boring, but in what's inside.

I went to walmart and bought a Kodak camera with docking station and printer.  This was my turning point.  Let me stress that I am NOT a professional photographer by any means, and have not gone to college for photography.  But the pictures I took turned out so well that I used it for eight years.  This year for christmas my husband decided to upgrade me.  I wanted another kodak but he convinced me to look at others just to make sure.  I looked at Sony, Fuji, and alot of others I won't care to mention but always kept coming back to Kodak.  I didn't want 16 mega pixel with only 8 gigs, or some of them were the other way around.  Customers reviews are a very useful tool for research, also because there was always something wrong with their product.  People who are more adept at taking pictures gave me more insight to the cameras and how they work and what I should look for.  After weeks of research and customer reviews, I finally convinced my husband to go with the Kodak Z950.  It has been the best money I have ever spent.  I am still learning about all of the bells and whistles and do a lot of deleting because I use the wrong settings, but after almost six months of use, I have to give Kudos to Kodak for this camera.

The low light performance is impressive for a point and shoot.  The battery life is excellent - over 100 pictures one day, including about 10 with flash, and the battery indicator still read full. I have a minor issue with the color resolution - I took some shots of my white lab out in the snow, and the shadows under his chin came out an odd green color.  You can only see it when you zoom way in, but this camera's color rendition program made that color up, for sure. My only other complaint is with the autofocus when taking video - not sure how to resolve this yet.  The camera searches for focus for too long, and even when the image is in focus and the subject distance is quite constant, it searches again and again, driving the focus out then re-finding it.

The Kodak is geared toward the novice, who wants better pictures than a mini-camera can provide.

I'm glad I did - it's worth the extra money.  The difference between the Z915 and the Z950 is like night and day.  Kodak EasyShare Z915 Digital Camera (Black)This camera feels heftier, not cheap, thin plastic (it is still plastic - it also weighs just a little more than the Z915).  Although the battery compartment has a metal hinge and it springs open a little too fast, which after the first time opening it I learned to hold on when it swings open, it does feel a little cheap. I also like that the threaded tripod mount is made of metal on this camera.This camera uses a lithium ion battery instead of AA batteries.  The initial charge when I first unpacked the camera took slightly over 2 hours with the camera  plugged into a 110V outlet.  You can also charge it via the USB port on your computer but it will take MUCH longer this way.  I recommend buying a spare battery and plug-in charger, it will make your life easier when using this camera.Easy to use without reading the manual - and if you do need help, part of the manual is stored on-board - just press the button on the back of the camera.  It takes incredible pictures, even better than expensive Fuji and Panasonic cameras I previously owned.  You can include the date on the picture, something I had to add myself with software with any of my Fuji's.  I'm not sure about Nikon, but I think Canon is the only other camera manufacturer where you can include the date on the picture.The shutter lag time is super fast.  I rarely miss a shot while waiting on the shutter to respond.  It's incredibly fast when using no flash, and still what seems to be under a second when using the flash.**NOTE:  Make sure you buy an SDHC memory card with a MINIMUM Class 6 rating for the fastest photo capturing. Too bad I can't make this bold, I cannot stress enough you will be unhappy with processing time between shots with a Class 2 or Class 4 SD card!****NOTE: QuickView is Kodak's name for their reviewing function.  Immediately after you take a picture, you see it displayed on the LCD screen for 5 seconds.  That's a long time to wait before your next shot, but if you lightly press the shutter button, the review picture goes away and you can take the next shot.  You can also turn this off completely, but then you can't quickly review what you have just taken.**There are also very few cameras in this price range where you can have full manual control should you want to - you can set your own focus, aperture, shutter speed, flash compensation and ISO.PROS:Large 3\" LCD screen, I can see it in the sun tooGood build quality, even though it's plastic, it's sturdyRight side of camera has a large rubber grip, so it won't slip from your handFull manual settings (PASM), hard to find in a camera this priceA wonderful 10X optical zoom from a great manufacturer of lenses, I previously owned a camera with a Leica lens and this Schneider-Kreuznach lens is just as goodHD videosOne year warranty (for the USA)CONS:Flimsy battery compartment doorI don't like the software that came with it, I prefer PicasaDefinitely a 5 star camera.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "HUGE bang for your buck!!", "Author": "R.

I can honestly say that this was an awesome purchase for me.Original Review:So far very impressed!!  To be able to get a package that does so much for less than $200....amazing!First the minor complaints.  The charging plug is huge.  I really like the Canon style that has the AC prongs that fold flat...much easier to travel with.  I bought mine as a package so it came with the USB cable.  It did not come with AV outputs which I think it should have...again, that is standard with Canon's.  If you would like to turn on the camera just to preview pictures it automatically extends the lens.  Would be nice to have a setting for review only without having to open and extend lens.  These are minor annoyances though.Very impressed with picture quality.  I am not a professional photographer so I will miss things the pros wont, but in my eyes the picture quality is excellent.  The image stabilization even at full zoom is great!  Indoor shots with the flash are quite good...not overly washed out when shooting close up.  My Canon pics would come out almost white when shooting a close up flash, so I was very pleased to be able to take close ups with a flash.Another very nice feature is the zoom is adjustable when taking video!  I could not find another ultra zoom point and shoot that did this, at least in this price range.  I took some video of a friend waterskiing and it came out very good, at least on my computer.  Haven't been able to test on a HD TV, but on a computer no complaints.  If you do zoom in and out while shooting video it takes a bit to focus, but this is not a dedicated video cam.On camera editing is another nice feature, from full cropping to touch up.  Stitching panorama shots is very easy and the output is fantastic.Have had the camera a few weeks and taken quite a few indoor shots with flash and I have not had to recharge yet.  Many other cameras have complaints of short battery life...this one ranks high.Finally, it feels good in the hands with a nice rubberized grip.  I really liked my old Canon Powershot, mostly due to it's tiny size, but the lack of zoom and poor indoor flash shots make this Kodak the camera I will reach for.This is my first Kodak digital camera and if it holds up like I think it will, it won't be my last!", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is one fantastic camera", "Author": "Ben Thompson", "ReviewID": "R1TCL1AQMEBML8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The zoom on this camera is fantastic for the size of the body, it still fits in your pocket, but expands out for a full 10x optical zoom.

Practically fell out of my chair.Colors are rich (maybe not 100% accurate but colors that pop and are deeply saturated), metering is unbelievable accurate (this little camera seems to avoid blowing out highlights that plague every little point and shoot I have tried up to now), pictures are pin sharp. Overall, this camera takes pictures that shocked me. Beautiful, sharp,  bright contrasty pictures.Ergonomics are excellent. The camera just fits nicely and solid in my hands, yet still small.Lens, for a point and shoot, is reasonably fast lens (fast lens refers basically to how efficiently the lens uses incoming light). Compare it to the megazooms from the major manufacter that starts with a C or a P.That being said, it is not perfect.-Build quality is below average, the body creaks if you hold it too tight.-Processing of images after you take a picture AND when switching between modes (Program to Manual, Shutter Priority) is very sluggish. Nothings happens fast with this camera.-Charging of battery in camera body is a clear cut cost savings method.

Stone", "ReviewID": "RTAYRG02SPD3R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "(Edited Jan. 15, 2011 after further use.) I had always overlooked Kodak cameras when testing cameras in stores, mostly because I didn't think I'd like the design of their control buttons on the back.  But after reading some reviews and hearing a friend say how much his sister loved her Kodak, I wanted to try this one.  I don't understand why I've never seen this particular model on display in any store I've been to.  Or why it was not reviewed in the most recent issue of Consumer Reports magazine that had digital camera reviews in it.  Kodak needs to try harder to get their products out in the public eye more.Anyway, so far this camera takes good sharp photos.  It has a lot of controls and features to choose from.  Once I got used to the display, buttons, and menu, they are not that bad.  The only thing I don't like is the little black joystick thing that you use to move your menu selection up and down, then press it to select.  Sometimes if you don't press it exactly in the middle, it will move your menu selection back up or down, instead of selecting.  But you get used to it.I compared photos from a Sony DSC-H20 and a Canon SD1200 that I already have.  The Sony model is in a similar class to this Kodak.  Overall I think the Kodak had sharper images with less noise.  It did really well with outdoor daylight photos, even all the way out at 10X zoom.  The only issue I had was in lower light settings in AUTO mode - some images were slightly over-exposed and some had *slightly* inaccurate color.I took photos of bright & colorful plastic kid's toys in a low light setting in AUTO mode with all 3 of my cameras.  The Canon had the  most accurate color, the Kodak was the sharpest, while the Sony had mostly accurate color but a LOT of noise.  The Kodak looked slightly brighter with a very slight yellowish or greenish tint to the toys, but the weird thing was that when I tried to adjust the levels in Photoshop, the software said the levels were fine.  So I tried adjusting the color saturation and hues, but never could get the color to look as accurate as the Canon images.  Strange.  But one thing that helped was taking pics in Program mode, keeping the color on Natural Color, but lowering the exposure settings a little.The AUTO mode seems to be okay for daylight or normal shooting conditions. You will probably have to tinker with the settings & take photos in Program or Manual if the conditions are less than ideal. I've consistently found indoor & people photos in Auto mode to be somewhat overexposed & yellowish. I can't seem to adjust the color to make it look right, even in Photoshop. There must be something in the Kodak processor that is doing weird things with the color, kind of like how my Canon always makes reds look too pink, or deep purples too blue.Video mode on this Kodak is not that great. It was kind of grainy, even in bright light. Some people mentioned you need to change the focus setting from \"continuous\" to \"single\" in order to avoid the \"jello\" effect when zooming.  I tried that, but it did not seem to help.  I would rate video on this camera as just okay, it probably would be fine for everyday family settings, or maybe daylight outdoor videos, etc.  But I'm definitely keeping my Sony for shooting videos at concerts; that camera has some awesome sound quality for concerts!Somebody below mentioned you have to use Kodak's software to upload images to your computer - not true.  You can plug it up to your computer with the USB cord and the computer will pick it up like an extra drive, so you can just drag & drop photos to wherever you want them.  If you don't want to use the Kodak software, you don't need to install it.IMPORTANT:  I like that this Kodak gives you the option to take photos in the 3:2 aspect ratio (at the 10 MP size), which is what you need to have prints made if you don't want your photos cropped on the top & bottom edges when prints are made.  This should really be the default aspect ratio for ALL digital cameras, because most people are going to want at least SOME prints made, and I don't know why all the camera manufacturers have moved to the default 4:3 size.  That is fine for the background image on a 4:3 computer monitor, if that's the only place you plan to put your images, but it's stupid for printed photographs.  My current Sony gives the 3:2 option also, but I've noticed that most of the new Sony cameras don't, which is a shame.Some reviewers complain about the slow time to process a photo.  This is probably just the review setting where the image shows up for 5 seconds.  You can turn this off, and if you need to review the image you just took, just hit the little \"play\" button at the bottom of the camera and you can see it pretty quickly.  Either that, or you may need to get at least a Class 4 SD card.Pros:*  Manual control and many features plus 10X zoom at a good price*  Clear sharp photos, easy to use, fairly quick response time*  Gives you the option for 3:2 aspect ratio, which is great for prints*  Good size and controls, easy to grip with the soft gray hand grip on front and thumb grip on backCons:*  Auto mode not quite as good under low light conditions, need to use P or M*  Videos mostly just mediocre quality, esp. under low light*  Would be nice if Kodak would make it in a cool color or something, maybe this would draw more people's attention.  It's shallow I know, but these days people mostly seem to be attracted to the cameras that look cool, regardless of their picture quality!", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Philip \"Vin\"", "ReviewID": "R21OJXOKZD7W40", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "if you are looking for a simple to use camera that takes a great picture look no further.

The Z950 offers a better variety of picture sizes, can shoot 720p HD video, and has an excellent zoom range - both optical and digital.  I like the size and weight of the camera, although the Z730 felt a little better in the hand from the more contoured body.

Battery life isn't as good as the Z730, and the recharge time is longer whether I use in-camera charging or remove the battery and use the standalone charger.Otherwise, I'm very pleased with the camera and its performance.

I was looking for a digital camera and looked at the Lumix DMC-TZ5k, ZS3, Canon PowerShot SX130is, SX200is, and SD4500, Sony CyberShot HX5V, and Nikon CoolPix S8100 in the price range of $150-250. It was a showdown between the Lumix ZS3, Sony HX5V and the Kodak Easyshare Z950. The Sony was the stand-out, but the Kodak won because the price was right. The Z950 has a 12.1 MP sensor, 10x optical zoom Schneider Kreuznach lens, image stabilization, and a set of full manual controls (P,A,S,M) plus scene modes and it shoots 720 HD video.The camera body is mostly plastic and just feels cheap, but it does have good heft to it. There's a rubberized texture on the right side under the shutter release front and back to help grip when shooting one handed, a nice feature. It's classified as a compact megazoom, but it's not all that compact. You'd be hard-pressed to fit it into a pant pocket. It's a little smaller than the Canon Powershot SX130is but bigger than the Panasonic Lumix TZ5 or ZS3.Handling and ergonomics are pretty good. The buttons are easy to press and the controls are well laid-out easy to find. There's a lighted marker for the mode selector and the flash control and timer buttons are illuminated, which I really like. You'll also get a HD badge to the left of the mode dial that glows red when you turn the camera on, which is a little gimmicky to me. There's a joystick on back for navigating menu controls which was easy to manipulate, and there are 4 hard keys along the right edge of the display for delete, quick menu, image information, and image view. The speaker is located above the joystick. The menu is well laid-out and the interface is easy to use and works well. I was able to access functions quickly and easily.When I turned the camera on I was greeted by a 12-13 second delay while it read the memory card, which is bad in case you want to take a picture right away (Kodak moments). Shooting performance is slow. I took 4 quick shots and was greeted by a 3 second delay while it did some processing. I was also dissapointed with the display. It's a 3 inch widescreen LCD with 230K dpi, which doesn't do the pictures this camera takes justice. I would have liked to see a 460 dpi screen like on the Panasonic, which really helps show the details in the picture you took, especially good for finding blurring.The pictures this camera takes are hit-and-miss. I got some really good ones but some not-so-good ones. The high point of this camera is the full manual controls and high quality optics. I can't think of any other point-and-shoot compact megazoom camera that offers as many manual controls as this one. The Lumix ZS3,7, PowerShot SX130is, SX200is or SD4500 have them, but not like the Kodak. You can help the camera take good pictures in difficult shooting conditions by adjusting the various parameters (aperture, shutter speed, exposure compensation). On automatic mode the camera tended to overexpose photos, but otherwise it's pretty \"intelligent.\" You get 17 preset sceen modes, a panorama, and sport modes. The panorama mode is a little finicky. It requires a steady hand to stitch the images together and there is a learning curve. Something I didn't have to do with the Panasonic Lumix.The flash is powerful and offers good range. Low-light photos without the flash are pretty good, but not great. You can fit that by switching to the shutter priority (S on the mode dial) and selecting a slower shutter speed, or the A setting and a larger apature. I almost think that the camera's image processor has trouble keeping up with the lens! I know the Schneider Variogon (think Leica, Zeiss, Swarovski) is capable of very good image transmission, but the camera can't make the most of its performance.You can also use a scene mode for night. Beware to keep the camera as still as possible though. It's almost mandatory to use a tripod to keep them from blurring. The image stabilizer works pretty good. However, the sport mode did little to prevent blurring fast-moving subjects in room lighting. Noise control is good enough, a little above average to me. There was some noticable noise at ISO's above 200 but not enough to take away from the picture quality. Anything above ISO 400 though and it gets intrusive as the camera tries to compensate by adding sharpening. The flash works good as well, but it does tend to turn the images a little blue in some cases, which was odd to me.The battery life is pretty good, average to me. I let it sit for 3 days without using it, and when I did use it I only got 100 pictures before it died. Kodak claims it can do 280-300, but in the real-world figure 250 at most. For durability, I'd be careful with it. It's mostly made of plastic. Only the lens and lens housing are aluminum, unlike my Panasonic, the Sony, and Canon which has aluminum-clad bodies. Drops will certainly cause damage. Plastic cracks easily unlike metal which dents. Be careful with it! Plus the battery door is made of thin flimsy plastic that seems like it would break off if you were too physical with it.The video is pretty good. You get three modes with 720P on top. The sounds were loud and you can zoom while recording. The zoom lens motors are quiet, but you can hear them. There is some very annoying focus-hunting while recording, especially at distant subjects using the zoom, but you can fix that by leaving it regular auto focus (not constant focus). The other complaint is the video format. It's a Quicktime format which I do not like much. AVI or MPEG would have been much better for compatibility. It doesn't work well with my computers, and sometimes the camera doesn't recognize it when I try to view it on the camera display.I have a 16GB card and I can shoot 30 min. of video in HD or store over 4,000 12MP pictures.So, that's the Z950. It's a great, no-frills, utilitarian camera that does a lot very well, despite being about $200. It's competitors also do a lot, some of them do it better. There are other really good cameras out there with similar features, but plan on spending $50-150 more for them. You can tell that Kodak did some cost-cutting in the feature set, but despite that it takes good pictures, has full manual controls, lots of desirable and essential features, a very nice lens, good ergonomics, and the price is right. Sure the display could be better resolution, the shooting performance could use improvement, the video could be better, and the photo quality is hit or miss, but if you're looking for a new 10x compact camera, look at Kodak first.Pros:Affordable12 MPFully adjustible manual controls3\" displayHigh quality opticsGood image qualityLighted controls for the flash, dial position marker, and timerLots of shooting scene modesCons:Poor shooting performanceImage quality can be hit-or-missVideo quality could be betterVideo formats in Quicktime onlyA little bulkyQuestionable durability", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "positive feedback", "Author": "grammymoody", "ReviewID": "R1TLHEKA3FFKPB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for an Alaska cruise.

With a trip to Europe coming, I started researching cameras to find a high MP and high zoom but didn't want to spend much more than $100.  Although this camera had 12MP instead of 14MP, I decided to try it because the price was in my range and I felt comfortable with the Kodak name.  I purchased a high speed 8MB internal card because I read that the recovery time between shots was slow for some users, as well as a spare battery...just in case.  I made a point to read some of the usage instructions before I left on the trip because other purchasers commented that the manual is a PDF file online instead of printed and included with the camera.When the camera arrived, I took a few test pictures and was floored.  The SD card was recognized instantly - no problems there.  The recovery time between photos was a couple of seconds but I figured out that I could lightly press the shutter button to prepare for the next shot immediately, or disable the display feature that shows the photo just taken on the view screen.  The photos picked up incredible detail that I hadn't noticed taking the picture, like a single dog hair stuck to the dog's nose.  The color and clarity were great.Once in Europe, the first real test was careening through Barcelona on the top of a double-deck tourist bus.  It actually became comical - I would just point in the general direction of the targeted building or landscape and push the button to get a phenomenal photo, no matter how fast the bus was whipping around turns or flying down a street.  When the bus paused to pick up more passengers, I played with the zoom features to grab detail on a gargoyle or rooftop garden.  My photos blew away a travel companion's from an older Sony.  All of outdoor shots were in daytime, natural light, landscape setting.Inside buildings like St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, the photos were a little more challenging but still very impressive.  Without flash (as required in some locations) and on the portrait setting, the photos were acceptable but flash/portrait were very good.  On the cruise ship, I captured some of the best photographs of people with sunsets in the background any of them have ever taken, as well as crisp, clean shots at dinner.I also used the panorama feature and was actually shocked to discover how easily and how well it worked.  It was a feature I hadn't read about so I had to figure it out on the fly.  Panorama was fantastic for ports with bays or inlets that were surrounded by beautiful scenery all the way around.Despite taking several hundred photographs, I never had to use the spare battery purchased on clearance at the local Target store.  I just charged the battery overnight each night and had no issues.  Thanks to the 8MB high-speed card, recovery time between shots was not an issue, though I did not try any photographs where the subject (and not the photographer) was moving.  I haven't printed any of the photos yet but online and zoomed/cropped, the photos surpass my expectations.Downsides:  The camera is definitely not a size that can be slipped in a pocket or small purse for carrying, and it is a bit heavier than some might like.  So far, this is the only complaint about the camera and not really a complaint because I prefer a bit sturdier feel to the camera.  It fits my hand well when shooting pictures and it is easy to *not* forget somewhere because it is larger.All in all, I am thrilled with the purchase, especially because I thought I would have to spend a lot more to obtain all the features I wanted.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Maria", "Author": "momma maria", "ReviewID": "R389B2WX1T04ZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the EasyShare c875, and was very happy with it and decided to upgrade to the higher zoom of the Z950 after reading other customer reviews here on Amazon.

All of my apprehensions were completely unfounded.  This is a GREAT camera!!  The manual settings are a nice feature allowing me the creative control I am used to.  The lens is very capable and it takes really good pictures.  The battery is a pretty high capacity for being factory, it takes a ton of photos before needing a recharge.  Also it is quite sturdy being somewhat larger than other digital point and shoots.  All of the cameras program settings are great too, which makes it really easy to just take snapshots and always takes good pictures inside in lower light and artificial light.  There is only one complaint which is really negligible, sometimes the camera runs slow when reviewing the pictures on the memory card or if I am taking alot of pictures very quickly.

The optical zoom and low light photo setting are outstanding, and the video quality is impressive. I missed having an 'eye' view finder but the LCD is large and the brightness settings offset even a sunny day. It also feels heavy / sturdy, and has great build quality. I felt that if I dropped it accidentally, I would be able to pick it up, dust it off, and start firing away again with no worries. Luckily, that never happened.If I had any complaint, it would be battery life. I expected the lithium battery that came w/ the camera to be good for hundreds of pics per day. That might be the case for daytime only, and no flash. However, if you do use flash or video for any appreciable amount of time (depends on the SD card size) expect the battery to drain quickly.

This time I probably should have done both. I was replacing an older Kodak with what I thought was a higher resolution newer model. Unfortunately I simply looked at the mega pixels and didn't pay attention to how they do the math. Unfortunately, 12 MP means 4000 x 3000 or a 3 to 4 aspect ratio. Considering that the typical print these days is 4 x 6, you can readily see that pictures will have to be cropped. You can get to 4 x 6 but only by changing the settings and reducing the resolution. I know that reducing the resolution doesn't seem like a big deal. But I prefer to take pictures at full resolution and then decide how I wish to print them later on.I just received the camera. It was a great deal on Amazon. I ordered it on a Wednesday and had the camera by Friday even with normal shipping. So I started fooling around with it Saturday morning. I discovered the aspect ratio after downloading the test photos to IPhoto. As I tried to crop the photos, I noticed how severely a 2 x 3 crop was impacting my photos. It was only then that I noticed that the photos looked almost square.I believe that this will still turn out to be a reasonably good camera for the money once I get used to this.

This camera takes absolutely wonderful pictures-- crystal clear,  with beautiful, vibrant  colors.  It has a big zoom and it is packed full of features:  Burst, sports, panorama, high speed, macro, and 15 different other modes.  But it has one flaw which in the end made me  return it.  Most of the pictures I take are inside and need a flash.  This camera has a long delay (something like 2 seconds!)  between flashes the first three times-- then a much longer delay (something like 6 or 7 seconds) to get it ready for the next round of three flashes.  I'm a slow photographer under the best of circumstances. As much as I loved it, as much as I wanted to make it work,  I had to return it.  But if  you want to take outdoor pictures or well-lit indoor pictures without a flash, or if you take indoor shots of interiors, objects-- anything that won't start looking grim-faced after standing around posing for a long time! --  definitely buy this camera.  It takes pictures better than many cameras that cost three times as much.  At the current price,  $115,  it's a complete steal.One more drawback--  there is no printed manual,  only an electronic manual to load on your computer.  The camera does have a sort of built-in encyclopedia so you can get a lot of info right on the camera.  But, feature-packed as it is, it takes a while to learn the controls, and they aren't intuitive.  In my opinion it is very short-sighted for camera manufacturers to not include a printed manual.If I could I would give the camera a 5+ for quality of photos,  a  5 for features,  a 1 for flash speed,  and a 2 for the inconvenience of no printed manual.

I am really bummed. Most of the pictures I got were pretty good. I did notice that in comparison with other Kodak cameras I have owned that the pics were more blurry and I had to take more time to let the camera really focus. It is not so great for action shots. Plus if I took more than 2 or 3 pics in a succession it would have to process and take sometimes a minute to be ready again.

(+) Great flash performance (+) Great panoramic mode (+) Great scenes modes(try the night portrait mode for some truly interesting pic outcomes at night). (+) very useful 10X zoom. (+) Price (shop around for the best price). (+) HD movies @ 720P (not the best quality but for the price... you'll be hard pressed to find similar).The minuses are as follows (-) Battery life isn't great - get a second battery (-) Ok Low light performance (without flash) (-) Not the fastest to process pics.Here are some recommendations for people that want the best out of their camera: Turn the camera off if you won't be shooting for 2-5 minutes (this saves batteries). The camera works while it is on analyzing the scene before you press the shutter button. Turn off continuous Image stabilization and instead press the shutter button halfway to activate Image stabilization. Read the manual to find this option. Buy an extra battery. Buy a class 4 or 6 SDHC card -- this will speeds the time taken to process pics significantly.In all I don't regret buying this camera, especially for the price I paid for it.

Real solid build quality - only thing missing and found on the higher-end priced competition is a true \"wide-angle\" lens.

I also liked the ability to resize to 3:2 since we commonly print only 6x4 for the album. So I started off a little biased towards Kodak. The new z950 represented a significant upgrade in MP and ability. It is a nice compromise between the usual point-and-shoot and the larger digital/slr types, because it has plenty of manual settings to play with, in addition to the range of scenes with their automatic settings. It is also small enough for large pockets/small handbags/purses, unlike the 20x zoom brigade. The 10x zoom is enough for my needs for sure. On regular Auto-no brain-point-and-shoot it is really quite clever in ascertaining the right setting. Like anything auto, you can catch it out occasionally, so it's not perfect, but I am impressed by how often it gets things right (such as dim background to bright foreground and vice versa).
