The accessories are fine and all-in-all, still a fairly good deal except for the camera model difference, which is basicly a shorter zoom.I'd recommend it as long as the buyers know that the advert is misleading. As a tip, ignore the Amazon description and scroll down to the end of the product description on anything you buy from amzon from now on.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "kathy", "ReviewID": "R29RSH2P6L1ABV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing I absolutely love it!
