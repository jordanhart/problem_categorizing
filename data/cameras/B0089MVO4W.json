Very clear, bright and close to what you actually see. Sometimes too many functions confuse me but I can always use 'premium auto' mode. It is sometimes difficult to focus on what you want in this mode, though. As I am not a 'camera guy', I need to learn more from the manual. BUT the camera case was not perfect as it is big but it was hard to take the camera out if I put other things in this case. A tripod is useful when you want to take 'perfect' night view. 8GB card was class4 so maybe it is a bit slow, I guess.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful pocket camera!", "Author": "Jennifer \"Jennifer\"", "ReviewID": "R1APZ5M4QWSST1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading David Pogue's review in the NY Times (which said \"Let me cut to the chase- no pictures this good have ever come from a camera this small) I decided to buy this camera. I'd been disappointed by a highly rated Canon pocket camera, and I found my phone had a faster shutter speed and took better pictures. I wasn't ready to go the SLR route, and don't want to carry around anything that big. This camera has everything promised, and then some. I haven't discovered everything it can do yet, and I've had it for several months. It takes super high quality, professional pictures and videos. The only drawback is the lack of a manual - you just have to spend some time with it and try lots of different settings and functions.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Sony DSC-RX100 20.2 MP Exmor CMOS Sensor Digital Camera with 3.6x Zoom BUNDLE with 8GB Card, Case, Card Reader, Mini tripod, LCD Screen Protectors + More", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sKQ22kAQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0089MVO4W"}}
