{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Compact\\ Good quality", "Author": "David Sundquist", "ReviewID": "R1V8NA1LV0VKT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The dimensions don't really do the size of this camera justice, it is very small\\compact. I ceiling mounted mine in a parking garage on top of a 2 gang junction box (using a blank cover plate). The footprint of the camera is barely bigger than the cover plate.My only complaint is like most IP camera's, even with a strong light source, the quality of nighttime footage is not stellar. During the day, I can get license plates of most cars moving at around 15 mph and most faces with some level of detail. At night, most vehicles are blurred and faces are blurred if the person is moving quickly.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$510.00", "Features": "A quality product by Vivotek", "Name": "Vivotek MD8562 Fixed Vandal-Proof Dome Network Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NdlwY8pvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0068S1LZQ"}}
