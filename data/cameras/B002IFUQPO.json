Put the money towards a 3D TV instead.  The resolution is rather low, and when viewing pictures in 3D, the resolution to each eye is cut in half.  There is also a significant amount of \"ghosting\" or \"cross-talk\" between the right and left images.  The navigation and controls are also a little show and awkward.  I'd rather view the pictures in the small viewer in a FinePix REAL 3D W3 camera, or on a 3D TV.3D TVs are now widely available and not too expensive, so you'd probably be better off saving the money and buying one of those instead.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not even close !!!", "Author": "Richard Huizinga", "ReviewID": "R3PD600MFC74OA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this after buying the 3d camara (which is great) and expected the same quality of screen.but it is not even close.the images are hard to put in focus and the manual was in Japanese, I had to download the english version.The shipping was done extremely fast, but the product is BAD", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 3D Viewer without needing glasses!", "Author": "jmh", "ReviewID": "R2IT77WH51S95Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works great.
