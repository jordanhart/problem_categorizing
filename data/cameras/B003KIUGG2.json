{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ok for the price range..as a starter camera", "Author": "MyPenName", "ReviewID": "R1GNS6Y8M21CN1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My daughter received this as a Christmas present. She was 12 yrs old at the time. Overall, I think it was a good choice for her, to start out with as a first camera. It is easy to use, has enough options to get decent pics and has held up well to alot of usage. Batteries seem to last a decent amount of time too, so that is a plus. If I remember correctly, this camera was bought on sale for thirty dollars, so it was definitely worth the price paid. It is a great purple color too.The build quality seems sort of cheap, but it has held up very well. We have had no issues with the swing-out screen or any other feature. Out of the package it seems lightweight and has that cheap feel to it, but after using it, you see that it isn't so bad at all. It is actually sort of nice that it is so lightweight.The flip out screen is a little small, but that was OK. It is big enough to see what you need to and is pretty crisp and clear. That screen is the only screen there is.. when folded out, there is no other screen on the body of the camera, so there is no dual view, etc. I think that is what gives it somewhat of the cheap feel - when it is flipped out, it removes the bulk from the body of the camera. Again, this is not exactly a downfall though.Pictures transfer to the computer easily. No difficult/confusing software to use.The picture quality is ok.. not too bad, but not amazing either. What do you really expect at this price range though??If you adjust the settings, you get decent pics. My daughter has used it alot and most of the pics turned out really nice. You aren't going to be able to catch fast motion or anything like that though, but again that is to be expected at this price range. The only time she had grainy or otherwise \"bad\" pics was when she just snapped away and did not adjust the settings or if she tried to take a picture of something that was in fast motion (a car speeding by, etc). Just remember to adjust the settings to your surroundings..wether low light, flash, no flash etc. It is quick and easy to do and you will be much more satisfied with the results.On a side note - My older daughter has a touch screen Nikon which I paid 10 times as much for and let me tell you that that thing takes some seriously crappy pics too if you don't adjust the settings properly. It also had a lens malfunction within 4 months of owning it and had to be replaced. So you can't go by price and brand name alone. This little 30 dollar camera has held up better than that 300 dollar Nikon and has just as good pics for the most part. The Nikon had more features, felt more well made, solid and durable,.. but then it died anyway..Overall for the price, this Vivitar is a decent little camera, especially as a starter camera for a child, a quick replacement or as a quick fill in until you find \"the one\" you want/need. Keep in mind, you are not going to get professional looking photos with any camera that costs anywhere near the price of this one.. you will need to drop hundreds and even thousands of dollars for that.. but for the price this one is definitely worth it and it's picture quality is exactly what it should be.I would definitely recommend it as a gift for a child who wants a camera, but you aren't quite sure how well they will take care of it etc or are not sure how many features they can/will make use of due to age, or if you are just simply not prepared to spend the amount of money needed for a \"good\" camera. It is a cheap gift, but when a child wants a digital camera, this will please them for sure.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vivitar ITwist Camera", "Author": "D. Lunn \"New Momma\"", "ReviewID": "R1P5241MQELGI2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not a bad camera for the price.  It LOOKS really nice, great color, light weight and small.  Pictures come out OK, but you have to adjust the settings in order for them to come out not looking yellow... the automatic setting doesn't work the best, like I said you need to adjust the settings yourself... and you should wait like 30 seconds before snapping the picture because the camera takes that long to adjust to the lighting in the room; you can actually see it adjusting on the screen, looking less and less yellow.  Haven't had pictures developed yet, but on the screen they look pretty good and overall for the price, it's not a bad camera at all.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Vivitar Itwist... not so hot!", "Author": "Lauren", "ReviewID": "R3FPHFEEKVREY6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was not impressed with the Vivitar Itwist VX018.  This camera rings true the saying \"You get what you pay for\".  I bought this camera for my daughter who is 10 yrs old after her $70 camera broke! I should have spent the extra $20 again because I would have been more satisfied.  Pictures quality is terrible and preview screen is very small... however the flip around screen is a handy feature.  I would think this camera would only be suitable for a young child.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not worth the Money, Not even worth $5", "Author": "Dreama", "ReviewID": "R2FBVI8LGWYAK5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I should of listened to the other reviews on this camera. It's not worth the money. Even if it was to be given away for free it would be a rip-off. The only 'good' aspects of this camera is that the viewing area can be turned for self portraits and that the camera is light-weight. The pictures come out yellow and/or orange (on screen and when downloaded to the computer). I tried every setting on there adjusting the lighting, brightness, indoor, outdoor, sport, florescent & irradesent lighting, portrait, etc... hours upon hours of trying with no luck. No matter what, the pictures came out very very poorly. The viewing screen looks like an old antenna tv. It has different color lines all through it, so it is very hard to see what you are pointing the camera at. This also was the color of yellow and orange, on the screen, no matter the setting combination. Lastly, it says it has 'anti-shake', well it did not work either. Not even in sport mode. The pics where still blurry or had a blur to them. I wouldn't even give this camera to a young child to take pics with.

With all basic camera options, she has also learned how to operate it, frame her subjects, and take better pictures without the risk of dropping an expensive unit.  Love that it is so easy to use, digital (delete all the bad ones), takes 2AA batteries (take or buy extras wherever we go) and has a cord to download to laptop.  She loves the rotating screen.  Only complaint is quality (yellowing) in low light conditions and poor close ups which you would expect at this price.
