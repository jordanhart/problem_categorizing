{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sunpak tripod review", "Author": "KH", "ReviewID": "R2R1SLMUBLRVZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tripod is very sturdy and one of the tallest tripods I've seen.  Many of the tripods I've seen max out at around 60-inches, whereas this extends to almost 73-inches giving me an advantage when I'm shooting from the back of my daughter's school auditorium and recording her track meets. Although the center post easily pulls out to form a monopod for the times when space is of the essence, the monopod only reaches 64-inches high.  A trick I've learned to obtain more height when space is restricted is to use the tripod as a monopod by closing up the legs and extending only one leg. As far as the function of the tripod the pan function is silky smooth and never sticky or jerky.  I've had minor problems with the tilt function being a little sticky and jerky but I've completely solved the problem by dismantling the head and using a petroleum jelly to lube to the friction parts. This created a silky smooth movement in the tilt feature without the expense of purchasing an expensive Fluid Head (which would not fit on the \u00bc-inch tripod base male threaded connection anyway). I also purchased a separate carrying case for the unit which holds the tripod perfectly. With these minor tweaks, I highly recommend this tripod to anyone looking for a sturdy tripod that can easily convert to a monopod and has industry leading height. Most of all the smooth controlled movements of the tripod will improve the quality of your videos tenfold and lend a professional touch to your productions.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Strong and very versatile", "Author": "Richard V. Mullen", "ReviewID": "RHPV594413PN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is so tough I don't put it in a case.  You can support a large camera even though I use a DSLR and find it perfect overkill.  The height is outstanding and adding the monopod is icing on the cake.  I have used the monopod and found it to be solid and well built.I purchased a second one because of shooting needs and now I will be using it for rails/sliders and the DV200 camera jib.  It is worth the extra money to get this and not have to worry about it falling apart or wimping out. I have been using mine alot for three years and no issues.I would give this 6 stars if you could tap into using the monopod length in addition to the already high tripod.  This would be like a mini crane/jib.Lastly, the feet have both metal spikes and an adjustable rubber foot so that you get perfect traction where you need it and no damaging nice floors.  Get this and don't worry.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "OK for first couple of uses", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R2KCXM0S229SVW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Recieved tripod in good condition.  Used it at first tournament, worked as intended.  Two or so weeks later, I went to use again at another tournament - issues started.  One of the legs will not stay locked, so I either have to tape it to keep it locked or not use it at it's full extension. also, the handle that you control the camera angle with...the lock nut won't screw down tight.  It turns about 2-3 times then it pops loose again.  Camera won't stay stable.  I've had a little 50\" Kodak tripod for 12+ years and it works flawlessly.  Reason I wanted this one was the height.  I use this mainly at volleyball tournaments and with the shorter one, EVERYONE that walks by gets in the video; whereas this one, I could raise it above most spectators and kids. But, it is no longer working as designed.And, with the time lapse, I am outside the return window.  I am going to try and contact the manufacturer and see if they will be of any assistance.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "not good at all", "Author": "Thomas Helsel", "ReviewID": "R1V7SPT0YRNP61", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this tripod for about an hour and returned it.  First off and most important, the lever that holds the mounting plate to the tripod flexes. Seems like the camera will fall out with a heavy lense. Took the screw out to see if I can fix and noticed the metal lever was cheap pot metal. The screw hole already looked stripped.  So basically the only thing holding $2,000 worth of gear is cheap pot metal with a stripped screw hole. Worse yet, that's not the problem with the mount. The whole lever mechanism has play by and it's not because of a loose screw. Seems like a design flaw.  Second, the monopod feature is completely useless.  The adjustment handle for the head pokes you in the neck when looking through the viewfinder.  Then there are other issues.  Everything on the head is plastic.  Read other reviews where the adjustment screws strip the threads if tightened too much. I can definitely see that happening.  I'm also used to a geared center post.  It not only prevents the camera from slamming down if the screw comes loose.  Also keeps the camera from falling out the other way if you the carry the tripod with the camera attached like I do.  On top of all that, it weights a ton. Couldn't imagine carrying that around all day.  Bottom line, it's a bad buy for a heavy tripod with a cheap plastic head.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Tripod", "Author": "David Rivas", "ReviewID": "R2W7QO2TPPJSH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the product!

I like that the pan head comes with the monopod when using. I use it at Concerts and use the tripod for extreme low light issues and stage lighting etc. Then I move around and take the monopod with me and station myself against a wall and the mono gets to pan where needed. Can't take a tripod everwhere. I also use monopod and lift above standing folks and by using a wireless shutter release I get photos that many in a crowded area would not.
