I have seen god rating and review about this camera in internet so decided to go for it.In Amazon there are a number of option and bundle available for Pentax K30 and this one best fit my requirements. This is just in my budget and the bundle includes just what i need. Other bundles include some tele-converter and extra wide angle converter, but you really don't want to have those in your bag. I like the shape and size of the camera. This is not bulky and still looks like a professional camera.Pros-----1) Wonderful and compact look2) 18-55 and 50-200 mm lens cover most of the subjects for common photography3) Image quality is very impressive even in low light condition4) This bundle is your pocket friendly5) Ease of useCons-----I don't find any till now.About the seller:-------------------They sell what they promise. You will get each component in the box that is mentioned here. And for me (LA, California) the shipment took only 4 days.Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase...EDIT: Just one word of caution for US buyers. The adapter does not fit to US plug points and u need a converter. As I came from India to US, I was carrying one converter for my laptop, so don't have any problem..", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0091IUQBA"}}
