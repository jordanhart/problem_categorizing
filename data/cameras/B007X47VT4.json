Its awesome I love the camera its features are incredible an the clarity of the pics is incredible. The lenses The 18-55mm is just fine make a great jobs the only think you need is practice. THe 70-300mm tamrom its suberb this lenses is really sharp and the macro feature is really cool for a lenses on this price range. All items come with their warrantie and brand new. The carrying case is perfect for the bundle and tripos is very cool too.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "The motherload for beginner photographers, love it!", "Author": "Aryeh", "ReviewID": "R23C3QC7YVS1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so happy I bought this kit. It's got everything a beginner needs, including of course, a good camera and an additional lens. The camera body itself is incredibly light and compact, perfect! External flash, lens filters for both lenses, battery charger, 16gb sd card, an ok tripod, stable enough to take moon pictures, sd card holder, neck strap (which I never used and got an Opteka one instead). Basically this is everything you could hope for and more for a very reasonable bargain, again, I'm incredibly happy I got it.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "A quantum leap for this old shooter...", "Author": "Mark A Wilkinson", "ReviewID": "RIPPK3UMZO8NB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's been a long time since I purchased an SLR and to say they've advanced in that time is the understatement of the year.  My old Minolta had automatic capability, but that's where the advances stopped.  I finally wore it out over 25 years, and I wish I hadn't waited so long because the D3200 is an absolute joy to use.  You can jump right in a take great pictures by just setting in on Auto and go, or you can study the very clear manual a while and start exploring what the machine can really do.  The 24 Megapixel sensor captures all the detail.  The autofocus is razor sharp with either lens.  The IR remote shutter release insures blur-free images for portraits.  I couldn't be happier, especially given the price.  It may be another 25 years before I get another one!", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good & i brought dec 6 2013", "Author": "AR siddiq", "ReviewID": "R243XIIMA8T86F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything good except Precision Design DSLR300 Digital Flash, worst performance... personally i didn't like it ( no sense & its flash always power full)", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007X47VT4"}}
