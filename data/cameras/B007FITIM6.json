Here are bits of info that I didn't find in reviews when I was shopping, and had hoped someone would post, along with a few surprises I found:1- Once you turn off the annoying start up tone, it takes less than a second to be ready, a big plus2- There is a zoom/focus ring. It is electronic, I would have preferred a mechanical one but it works well. Zoom or focus selectable by a switch3- The sweep panorama mode works well with the exception of the fact that it has a fixed width. If you don't sweep far enough within the allotted time, e.g. because you don't want too wide a panorama, the rest of the image will be filled with a grey filler. I hope a firmware update will fix this as it looks hideous.4- Macro photos are not the greatest.5- Ability to select the mode automatically works well.6- When powered on, the extending lens struggles if lens cover is still on. Would have been nice if it were removed automatically (too spoiled, I know)7- The included charger is an in-camera charger. It can power the camera for use and also while connected to a PC. To charge an extra battery, you'll need to buy a separate standalone charger. While connected to a PC, the camera charges the battery through the USB port.8- Great camera. Amazon and Beach Camera are outstanding.9- The bundle from Beach Camera is great (Make sure to get the one with the 16GB card)I like the camera and will definitely keep it for years to come.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony no Baloney", "Author": "Lost Johnny", "ReviewID": "R1B4I1CSHN7WZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this camera for our 40th anniversry celebration trip to Honolulu.  At first I was leary of the 30X magnification, knowing it is very difficult to get crystal clear pictures when magnifying an image 30X; but I soon learned that Sony's image stabalization technique was very proficient.  I was taking pictures from our 20th floor room lenai, of the Waikiki Marriot Beach Resort.  I took pictures of people surfing who were almost invisible with the naked eye, and the pictures came out so clear that we could tell what surfers were wearing, what colors their boards' were, and how badly they would wipe out.  We took pictures of boats and ships sailing by and could even clearly see the passengers on these cruise boats.  I could not believe how sharp and clear the pictures came out even when on full magnification--I was more than a little impressed.  Then we went to Wiamea Falls and I took about two hundred pictures of flowers and plants--I didn't have to do anything, just point and shoot and the camera did the rest.  You can see the little flecks of pollen on the flowers and the fine details are so clear it looks like pictures taken from a photography magazine.  Our next stop was the Honolulu Zoo where we got pictures of lions, and tigers, but no bears.  I used the movie mode and could not believe the quality of the image--just like watching a HD show on a HDTV.  We also went to the Aquarium and took many pictures of the marine life.  Again, it was amazing how clear and crisp the pictures came out--even when taking them though the glass aquarium tanks.  When we got home I started cropping pictures, because in many of them when you looked close you could see other marine life that went unnoticed when viewing the full picture.  We have roughly 1200 pictures that we will now choose the best and most representative of our trip.  Other people I have shown some of the pictures cannot believe that I took them--they look professionally done.  Thank you Sony for this great product--I look forward to years of more picture perfect pictures.  If there is a way for me to send you some of our pictures as a testament to my statements I would be more than happy to share.Randall B Miller", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera!", "Author": "Kacey", "ReviewID": "R1MU0M7TAACK6D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera to replace an old Kodak.  I didn't want to go to a DSLR and have to deal with lenses so I thought this would be a good step up from my point and shoot.  I attend a LOT of concerts, and a lot of times, security gives you a hard time with what they call \"professional\" cameras that have removable lenses.  So I did a lot of research on this camera and the other cameras out there that are comparable to this one.  I decided to go with the Sony due to the fact that it had such a high megapixel (18.2) and long zoom (30x, but it actually zooms to 60x).  Used this camera at 2 concerts already and got absolutely amazing pictures!  Even in the low light concert setting.  The tracking focus keeps my pictures from being blurry.  Just attended the Kenny Chesney/Tim McGraw concert at the Georgia Dome and had lower level seats, and out of the 280 pics I took, only 4 ended up a little blurry.  The rest were crystal clear and the zoom on this camera is absolutely amazing!!  I also shoot lots of video at concerts and the videos I took with this camera are just unbelievable.  Great sound quality.  And I also like the fact that you can take pictures while shooting video.  I have also taken pictures of flowers and our pets in the back yard, and the clarity of those pictures in bright sunlight equals that of the DSLR's that my friends own.  I would HIGHLY recommend this camera to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it!!", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera Great but issue with selector", "Author": "Naz", "ReviewID": "RZUID2YNMJDTK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera deserves a rating of 5 but was disappointed when I started using that the camera would automatically change the mode when taking a picture.

The images were much less than I expected based on write-ups and reviews I've seen from others. I noted this most in regard to resolution, which was considerably less than I expected.  To be sure, there is a resolution price to pay for a long-zoom lens; however, I felt the resolution was considerably less than I would have expected even given that.  I also found the colors to be less true than I expected.I did quite a bit of searching before purchasing this camera, and in the mid-price range it certainly has many desirable features.But, in the end it is the final image which counts.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super Camera", "Author": "Catherine", "ReviewID": "RNVRKN59YWR38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera from overseas and I received it within a week!  That is super service!The camera itself is fantastic, it does all that an amateur photographer wants from a camera.The kit is super as well, because you get all that you need for your camera at once and you do not have to shop for extra items.  The only thing that I would have liked to get in the kit is a separate charger; so that one can still use the camera even if the battery is charging.  I had to get a charger separately.

It came with all the accessories seen.  The 30x zoom is incredible.  I can shoot from the right field bleachers at a ballgame and get a clean, clear picture of the pitcher and/or batter.  The 18.2 MP is crystal clear.  Take a great shot, get the picture blown up, frame it and you have art for your home.  It's very intuitive as well.  You have to go online to read the manual but, a couple hours playing with the features you'll learn on your own.  It's pretty easy.  I like it only because it doesn't quite meet the Canon and Nikon's.

It does not have swappable lenses but you'd never know it with how great the digital zoom is on this beauty. Extremely light weight. Lots of pictures per charge. Very fast to power up. Lots of build in features that I still haven't gotten to them all. Very easy to view and delete pictures on the camera itself so as to not fill up the memory card with images you don't want to keep.

We had been using a point and shoot, but once it died, we wanted to step up.  We wanted something that could combine the ease of use of a point and shoot with the image quality and options of a fancier camera such as a SLR.  We are very impressed with this camera.  The speed is great, and the image quality is wonderful.  Amazing zoom, too.  I got a shot of a small sparrow on the top of a 3 storey house that turned out crystal clear and full of sharp detail.  It makes taking beautiful pictures easy.  There are a lot of different options (different scenes, panorama, etc), so if you get it for an upcoming event, give yourself some time to fiddle with it and get to know it.  You can take two pictures of the same thing using different options and come out with drastically different results. We bought it with the bundle or stuff and are very, very happy with it.  By all means read up on reviews from several sites to be sure you would be happy with a megazoom, but for us--and we are very picky about image and color--we are thrilled.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera--terrific HD video", "Author": "Happy Mom \"Happy Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R2JL2FNEGSPWB9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the camera to video and get sports shots of my daughter at her athletic events.

So after much confusing research (I don't understand a majority of the technical jargon related to cameras) I settled on this one.  The deal that came with this camera was outstanding.  The camera itself:  I've always been a point and shoot camera gal so this camera was a little intimidating at first but didn't take much time to get used to.  The settings took a bit longer to get used to and I'm still figuring some out.  as far as the photos....unbelievable.  I'm so impressed.  I just got back from a vacation to Austin Tx and took the camera with me to \"test it out\".  I got some amazing shots from far, far away with awesome detail and video tape of the famous bats leaving the Congress bridge at dusk (famous sightseeing event in Austin nightly).  I could not be any happier with my choice.  I did order a separate batter charger to always have the other battery that came with the package deal charged and am going to purchase a shoulder strap for carrying since the neck strap included in the package was uncomfortable for me.  My daughter (who lives in Austin) is a future film director and used the camera and was blown away.
