{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "bibliobob \"bibliobob\"", "ReviewID": "RUAMP6NFQIXOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For serious photography, I prefer a big, heavy digital SLR. But where my goal is not photography but I want a camera along for snapshots, I use this.I expected to buy a Lumix LX-series or Canon S95 - both attempts to match the capabilities of a SLR as much as possible in an easily-pocketable camera. But as I kept reading the reviews I got more confused, until I remembered the basic laws of physics haven't been repealed.To roughly summarize the camera review sites, all major-brand subcompacts do a good job in bright light. The differentiators are low light, flash, performance, and manual control. And when you read carefully, you realize there's not a lot of practical difference here either. But there's no way to compare them without exaggerating the differences, which makes them sound more significant than they really are.LOW LIGHTIn low light, digital cameras increase the ISO, which means the weak signal coming from the sensor is amplified. This also amplifies noise, which causes an overall grainy look and, in dark areas, colored confetti.  I don't expect any camera to work well in low light; this goes for pro-level DSLRs and film cameras as well. So paying extra for a camera that's really bad in low light rather than terrible doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  It's a lot like choosing sunglasses based on their performance in dim light, or a screwdriver for its ability to drive a nail.FLASHFor flash, a commercial photographer typically uses a power pack that may draw 15 amps AC and power multiple heads which range in size from 4\" diameter to over 36\". Subcompact cameras have ridiculously small batteries and tiny flash tubes (typically under 0.2 sq inches) located at the worst possible place: near the lens.  It amazes me that any of them work as well as they do. Do I really care that one extends to 13 feet and another only 11.75? There have been times where I'd wished for a more powerful flash, but I'm thinking an extra 30 feet; I wouldn't notice an extra 2 or 3.The A3000 flash will synch any ordinary slave flash if you turn off the red-eye feature in the camera. It won't meter it, however, so it's easy to wash out the picture. I believe this is true for all Canon subcompacts.PERFORMANCEWhen prefocused, picture-to-picture processing time is barely noticeable -- less than half a second. When you include focusing time, less than 2.5 seconds. It's faster with the continuous shot option, which does not refocus between exposures. This is respectable, and more than enough for my needs. To keep up with a very active child or pet, you might want faster performance. Tested with 4 GB Lexar Platinum II 9MB/sec SDHC.MANUAL CONTROLI use manual control on my SLR most of the time. I had it on my last two subcompacts, and seldom used it. The A3000 doesn't have it. The only time I missed it was using slave flash. If I'm out with the family, I don't want to be thinking like a photographer, so the camera will probably make better decisions. And manual control is less convenient on a subcompact because of the ergonomic compromises necessary for such a small camera. Nice to have, but as processors get smarter, less important.MEGAPIXELSThe best professional color printers print 90,000 dots per square inch. That means it takes 4 x 6 x 90,000 = 2.2 megapixels for a 4 x 6 print. 5 x 7 = 3.2 megapixels. 8 x 10 = 7.2 megapixels.  Higher megapixels increase image file size and shot-to-shot delay (while the camera compresses the image and writes it out to the card). The only advantage to \"higher resolution\" than that required for your final print: you can crop the picture a bit without losing any picture quality. The A3000 is 10 meg; if they had a 6 meg version, it would be a better camera. Canon knows this; they also know megapixels are a lot easier to sell.SENSOR SIZEBigger is better, but more important than sensor size is pixel size - the larger the pixels the higher the dynamic range, which means more detail in very bright and very dark areas. It usually means better low-light performance and less noise because of other engineering choices available because of the larger pixels.The difference in sensor size between this and some of the more expensive small cameras (S95) seems significant until you put it into perspective. The pixel size of a Canon S95 is 6% that of a 12-meg professional DSLR (FX format). A3000 is 4%. Given the dynamic range and low-light performance of a pro DSLR isn't that great, I don't see any reason to pay a premium for 6% vs 4%.CONCLUSIONMy ideal small camera - pocketable, usably large viewfinder (I can accept a smaller LCD), 5-6 megapixels, manual control, image stabilization (small cameras are hard to hold steady), not cluttered with silly features - is no longer made. If a camera manufacturer wants me to spend more, they're going to have to come closer to that; more megapixels won't do it.Until then, I'm OK with the A3000. Pictures are excellent for a subcompact. Flash even in a big room is more than acceptable for on-camera flash, focus is quick and remarkably adept at identifying the right subject, image stabilization works as well as I'd hoped. Controls are well laid out and intuitive. LCD is bright and clear, even outdoors. The shutter release could be more prominent, and I may attach a thin rubber disk to make it easier to find by feel.The A3000 doesn't looking expensive, so subjects tend to ignore it. And I'm more likely to take it along because it if gets damaged or lost, or encounters the uneconomical-to-repair \"lens error\" that seems to afflict all brands, it's not a big deal.

Very cheap feel...camera feels very hollow and light. Pictures are great as usual from Canon. Not as many functions as my SD940 but a good point and shoot for the price. The right corner nob is a new twist for Canon ELPH models which looked weird at first but fast if you want to switch shooting modes (compared to my SD940). The thickness could be more compact given that the camera feels so light and hollow inside. The buttons need to be more crisp but its the pictures what matters most. Overall, decent camera for the money.

Her last camera had a lot of scratches on the LCD, so I put protective film on this one right away as the large LCD looks like it will be prone to it as well, maybe even more so.

I enjoy the rotating knob on top, that is what hooked me. The photos seem to be as good as my Canon that last year cost me over twice as much. It has all the controls you need for everyday snapshots, and then some. It is light weight. It is thick enough to hold onto securely. The photos come out very sharp. Low light capability seems just fine. I normally use Program Mode so I can set my own ASA (100 or 200) and Neutral Color. You could spend 100 dollar more a get a few more functions but not necessarily better photos. I think you would have to put out 200 dollars more to get results and control that was significantly better. I don't take a lot of video so the video capabilities of this camera (which I have not even tried yet) might be one reason this camera is so inexpensive.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simplicity meets quality.", "Author": "C.H.", "ReviewID": "R30YUMHP7S7K8F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not a professional photographer but I do appreciate quality, and I greatly enjoy casual photography. I tried out this camera in a couple of stores and it really impressed me with photo quality and ease of use. In fact, I had already ordered the Sony Cybershot DSC-W350 to replace my previous Sony, but will be returning it as soon as it arrives. The W350 really has too many features I don't need, but this camera has just what I need - the ability to take great pictures in different circumstances. Not to mention, the price is pretty nice from many retailers.Also, I like the way it feels in my hands. It's kind of chunky compared to other digital cameras of this generation, but I actually prefer that, as it's easier to hold and control. The buttons feel sturdy, and I like the fact that it has a mode selection wheel, which is very simple to use.Out of all the digital point & shoot cameras I have had the opportunity to use over the years (including an older Canon, a Sony, and a Panasonic), I have found that this camera is the best at producing colors that are true to life. That is one of the major points that sold me on this camera, and was quite surprising to me!The auto mode and easy auto mode work okay and are a good option if you just want to take a picture without having to mess with settings, but I prefer to use the program mode and adjust the available settings myself (keep in mind, this is a point & shoot so the manual settings are limited). I feel I can get better pictures, most of the time, if I tweak the settings myself. However you prefer to take the pictures, the options are there at the turn of a wheel!The only bad thing I can really say about this camera is that the microphone is not all that great. It's perfectly FINE for most videos, but videos of concerts can sound badly garbled if it is very loud or if there's a lot of bass. If not for that then I'd give this camera a perfect 5 stars.Overall, I really enjoy using this camera. It's not a pro camera by any means, but it is a nice point & shoot for everyday use, and 10 megapixels is PLENTY unless you plan on printing poster sized pictures. This camera caught me by surprise, and I'm glad it did! However, if you're in the market for something very compact, or with a lot of bells and whistles, then you might want to skip this camera.

I've used it for a few days now and feel comfortable recommending it.  I've tested it out in various lighting conditions both indoor and out.  Each time the picture qualitly has been good to great.  Exposure seems right on each time just on the auto setting.  If for some reason the conditions are not right the compensation settings can be accessed  right from the top wheel which is a nice feature.  It is only 10 mega pixel, but I've since learned that picture quality and the number of mega pixels don't necessarily go hand in hand, at least not with cheaper point and shoot cameras.  For example I originally bought a Nikon which was a 14 mega pixel camera which I returned because the picture quality was terrible in anything but outdoor conditions.

The bundle that Amazon is currently promoting is a steal so I jumped at the opportunity to own this most excellent camera. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but after turning on the A3000 and taking a few photos, I was really impressed. Out of the 30 or so pics I've taken, not one is blurry or to bright/dark or soft. I'm not sure if it's even possible to take a bad photo. Every picture was crystal clear. Very sharp images for an entry level camera. I am extremely happy with my purchase. I played with the video for a few minutes and it's nothing to shout about. Those interested in shooting video, this is NOT the camera for you. However, I have other devices that take video and only wanted a camera to take pictures. I highly recommend this camera. It's budget friendly, produces amazing photos, and best of all it uses a lithium ion battery :) It even comes with a charger so I dont have to pull out my laptop everytime it needs to be charged.

The 2.7 inch LED display screen is bright and viewable in even in direct sunlight. This camera is light and generally intuitive to operate. Still image quality was fine, and will provide enough resolution to print to 8\" x 10\" without loss of fidelity (the online description claims 13\" x 9\", but I could not test that large with my printer). Video is standard definition, and when used indoor, you can expect significant noise/graininess in the .avi output files. This still may be preferable to carrying a second video capture device if video is not your primary interest.I did not install the included utility software that came with camera. Two separate Windows 7 machines (a latptop and desktop) immediately recognized it, and I was able to transfer and delete images and videos without removing the SD card. The user guide indicates that video transfer, metadata and image orientation can all experience difficulty if the Canon software isn't used, but I experienced none of these.I didn't discover any show-stopping issues with this camera, and at the current discounted price, it's an excellent value. Why 4 stars? Three main reasons:(1) No included user guide. You must either copy this (.pdf file) from the utility CD or download from Canon's site. Sorry: a printed full user guide should ship with the camera. And, the .pdf version should have included color (present only to differentiate labels for the two models of camera the guide is written for).(2) No SD memory card included. I'm lucky to have some extras around. If you gave this as a gift to somebody without one...the joy would be delayed until the next trip to a brick and mortar store. Even if it were a low capacity one, a memory card should have shipped with camera.(3) Proprietary form factor battery charger. Going on the road? Make sure you take it with you. While I'm sure this was a choice made to accommodate the camera's thin profile, the use of CRV or AA batteries would have been more user-friendly. The user manual indicates it will take approximately 230 pictures between charges. If you're taking a lot...that's not going to get through many shooting sessions.

After reading dozens of reviews I decided on this one. My use is pictures of the grandkids, my car restorations for my web sites, and delivery or quality problems to send to my suppliers, using the macro a lot.Canon has gone a long way with this one from the Samsung and 3 Sonys I've had in the last few years. The automatic setting is really automatic, and it shows you the settings it is determining. It not only adjusts flash but macro settings, face, and other things if you have it on auto. No more forgetting to change from macro and losing your next dozen pictures. This of course adds a second or so in taking the first shot, but that was only really noticeable the first day or so. I haven't played with all of the non-auto settings yet.Videos are extremely clear and detailed, showing nicely on full screen.Another plus is the lithium battery, so it is lighter and less bulky, takes more pics per charge. Lithium can/should be recharges before hitting zero, so I prefer those.The colors are much more vibrant than the Samsung and Sony it replaces.On the negative side, it is just as the Samsung and Sonys in detail in shaded areas, so when there is a large range of light I still need to dig into the shadows with iphoto and bring them back. Detail is great until you get it way out to full zoom, then it becomes a little grainy.I ordered a second one for my office and another for a friend.BTW: the \"Case Logic\" case Amazon recommends for it is a perfect fit, with both a belt loop and a loop to fasten it to things", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simple digital camera for a non-techie", "Author": "Costume Nut", "ReviewID": "R1BS3AL8C71EE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like simple.

I remember in photography school years ago being given the assignment to build and use a pinhole camera, with film as the medium, and bring back creative photos. I did just that and it was a great learning experience on how to do much with little.  In this digital age this camera is probably considered to be rudimentary by many - perhaps it is - yet I have fine photos that I would be proud to show anywhere. If this is simplicity I am blown away.  I do not hesitate recommending this camera which for the price is a great and quality buy. The battery lasts beautifully in spite of what some reviewers say, and the interface with computer and TV worked the first time without any tinkering. I miss not having a viewfinder but I am getting used to composing a picture by taking an extra few seconds to move the screen - which is a little problematic in bright sunlight. a minor problem to be sure.  I am glad I ignored the impulse to go for 14.1 meg. etc and try this camera. It is a ten dollar upgrade from the same model Consumer Reports recommended as a best buy. For the ten dollars movement stabilization is included for these getting older hands, a great feature.  A little care is needed for focusing which I am finding not hard to do.  No downside for any average user and a pleasant challenge for advanced photographers, which will keep one away from the technology and into creating pictures in the way I always have, without constant adjustment as the tool easily becomes second nature.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "Margo", "ReviewID": "RT90YF21O7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was supprised by quility of the pictures. would be good to have zoom more then 4x.

Robinson", "ReviewID": "R381BRR43JE8FF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This must be near the end of the line in terms of this design model and it's upgrades and I am sorry I did not know it sooner. The Canon Powershot A3000IS is a little adjust-a-dial, four way toggle button camera that looks remarkably like an old Vivitar which came free with a printer 7 years ago, but the canon is bigger.  I think of it as almost manual in that it is frustratingly slow in the most automatic settings, and to use the others I don't have to be a photographer but I do have to be an analyst with experience for how each setting works best compared to each other and under what conditions. Sadly the moment is often lost, even with the children/pets setting.  The LCD screen does not reflect the color of the image accurately, which is a good thing. The stabilization feature seems to work better with a moving subject than a shaky hand - on our trip a number of the outdoor photos I took while milling around the group of people had to be ditched for lack of focus but the dancing shots and the snaps my kids took out of the car window driving home were surprisingly clear.The camera arrived just before a wedding so I brought it to the garden reception which I would think is tricky lighting - it did very well there. Using the zoom I caught a photographer with my kids and later sent him the pic - he replied that it looked like a postcard, minus the doofus with the camera. :) The shades of light in the pond and leaves looked invitingly beautiful while keeping skin tones natural. Conversely it also took some pleasant photos of people gathered in the shade of the tents despite a bright sunny background that was impossible to eliminate.In conclusion, I will be needing to spend more money on another camera sooner than I wanted to, but there is a good chance I will look closely at other offerings by Canon because the quality in the shots is really very pleasant.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera for its price", "Author": "A.

The second issue has to do with processing speed. I frequently like to take several pictures in a row--click, click, click. My old Kodak could do that, but my new powershot can not.

And the last of my complaints--the camera kept blinking the \"shaky camera\" icon at me, meaning I wasn't holding the camera steady. I've never had trouble with that before. My pictures were never blurry, nor did I shake when using the Kodak.All that being said, the camera does take very good pictures when the subject is unmoving and it is easy to use. It is very lightweight, but does have a cheap plasticky feel to it.I am returning the camera and hunting for another Kodak!", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice for our needs", "Author": "Alyunya422", "ReviewID": "R3FYYI5TNERI0W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice light camera with good zoom and veryt nice picture quality.

They just sent another estimate.Now, refurb cameras (what they'd send me if I paid $92 for a \"repair\") are selling for $69, and new cameras are going for $95 -- and Canon wants me to send them $92 for an out-of-warranty exchange.

At it's price point, it's not likely to be beaten in feaures, or lens quality. I keep trying out these inexpensive Canon P&S; cameras, and they're typically terrific save for one flaw.The one flaw that they all seem to suffer from(even the later models with the Digic IV processor) is the inablility to deal with lots of material in the red part of the spectrum. I should note that I'm not a professional, but a relatively serious amateur that has pretty high standards for even the least expensive P&S.;The oversaturation of complex reds in a scene(I use a particular spot in my flower garden to test for resolution of this admittedly hard to deal with subject) shows the camera's limitations. The reds are not so oversaturated that the subject loses all definition, but the reds do lose a lot of sharpness. I should note that macro shots of individual flowers are very sharp and there is little color shifting. They are also resolved to an unexpectedly high degree.Battery life with the Li-ion battery is reasonable. Some people will dismiss this camera because of the proprietary Li-ion battery, but not me. Rechargeable batteries with included charger at this price point are really a plus.Since I'm comparing this camera to other sub xxx dollar cameras, it doesn't warrant removing a star for it's inability to resolve a very complex scene with five different - and brilliantly colored - shades in the red part of the spectrum. No camera(Canon or otherwise) around this price point - and many that are multiples of the cost of the A3000IS - I have tried have a roughly equally difficult time with this scene.In summation, it doesn't get much, if any, better than this for your money spent. I'm hopeful that in time, as the pixel wars die, and that CMOS sensors migrate into the bottom of manufacturer's lines, things will likely change, but for now..this little P&S; is a quite competent camera at a bargain price.
