I have been waiting for this waterproof case to become available to protect my EGO camera when I mount it to my truck during off-roading trips.  This case is just what I hoped it would be - strong, easy to use, and seals tight.  I'm a lot more comfortable with my camera mounted to my front bumper now, even during inclement weather.I am giving my review a 1 star deduction for only one reason - at certain angles in the sun, a little bit of glare occurs from the front of this case.  It's not distracting at all, but now that I know it's there it bugs me.  It's only at certain exact angles when facing towards the sun so it's not all the time.  Actually, I get more glare from my windshield than I do from this case, so don't let that affect your decision.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "As advertised", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R1M0STL85V88IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works as advertised.

It looks like it would work great. However, I bought it with the chest harness, and didn't find out until it was too late, that the waterproof housing is too big to fit into the chest harness.
