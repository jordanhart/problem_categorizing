{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "A. G. Mullins", "ReviewID": "R2X4TOEETDVV3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 8 yr old son saved up his money to buy a new camera.  This one was in the right price range and his last camera was a Fujifilm that he liked so we purchased it for him.  He absolutely loves it, and it has so many cool features on it.  (Unexpected features for a camera in this price range - I didn't really check it out that much in advance since we were looking for a simply point & shoot).  We love it so much that I'm considering buying myself one and getting rid of my own Nikon Coolpix!", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice panorama camera", "Author": "KSArnold", "ReviewID": "R3SHRBCMAK3P57", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you like panorama pictures this camera makes them easy to take.  In panorama mode you take a picture and then line up the next one or two pictures with the crosshairs in the viewer.  When you play the picture back in the camera it plays like a video left to right.  When you put it on the computer you just see the stationary picture.I had a big problem with this camera.  After I set it up it kept saying the batteries were low on power and it shut down even though I knew the batteries were freshly charged.  I found that with the camera set for alkaline batteries using rechargeable batteries the camera worked great.I really only got this camera for the panorama pictures.  It does a great job of it.  If you like them too then give this a try.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like it", "Author": "Christine S.

A. Coshow Jr.", "ReviewID": "RZKA5POL09MEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a good camera for a family trip, but one that wouldn't bankrupt me. Research led me to the Fujifilm FinePix. Most of the reviews are very positive, but some complain about the complexity. Make no mistake: this camera has a LOT of little features, which is great. But it doesn't have a nice, user-friendly manual to teach you how to use them all. Shame on you, Fuji.That being said, it didn't take a lot to figure out how to get around on the camera's interface. Usually, if I just leave it on automatic mode, it takes GREAT pictures. And it's doing well on regular AA batteries, too, which is a plus - so many new electronic gadgets require lithium, high-output batteries.So, great camera, needs a good manual, takes great pictures in auto, amazing camera at the price, but do your research and know what you're getting into before you buy.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0073LM9O4"}}
