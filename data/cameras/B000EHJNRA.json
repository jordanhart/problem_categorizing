{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautiful pics time after time", "Author": "Calla Lilly", "ReviewID": "R1N90GGFD5HR44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this camera.  My previous camera was a Minolta SLR, which I also loved, and I swore I would never \"go digital\".  I have three children (ages 7, 4, and 1) and I was going through at least 2 rolls of film/month... more if a special event occurred.  Several photos on each roll wouldn't turn out, of course, and sometimes (at Christmas, for example) I'd waste an entire roll in one sitting, hoping to get JUST ONE photo where all three cherubs were looking in my direction.  But I loved the beauty of the prints so much, and I thought a digital camera couldn't compare.  Oh, how wrong I was!  My parents got my husband & me the Kodak for Christmas, and I (sadly but truthfully) haven't touched the Minolta since.  I have just as much fun playing with this camera as I did my SLR, turning off the flash and using natural light and changing the color setting to black/white or sepia.  My prints are gorgeous, and the best part is knowing what I'm getting BEFORE I visit the photo lab.  I also like the rechargeable dock, even if it is a little bulky to travel with.  I would recommend this camera time and time again, especially to digital \"rookies\" like myself!", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "One year warranty warning, not enough", "Author": "James King", "ReviewID": "RI3J29FUMMXMJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After getting this camera as a gift last Xmas(2005) i was pleased with the features and picture quality.  However, when attempting to use it this Xmas (2006) i was greatly upset when it would not turn on at all.  It works in the docking station only and a new battery does not fix it.  I had only used it about 4 times in that first year and when contactin Kodak about a obvious defect, they blew me off and said it was out of it's one year warranty and all i could do was trade it in and buy a referbished lower end camera for about as much as i paid for this one.  I am no longer a Kodak customer due to this and their response to my inquires.  This is not to disuade anyone from buying this product, just know about their warranty and how they deal with them before buying.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Maggie", "ReviewID": "RX9PLZ7ITR5V2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this camera!  I already used the Kodak easyshare software, and there were zero glitches with updating my camera and dock.  The short video clips I can take turn out well too. HOWEVER, I bought this camera thinking that video clips, while shorter, would be just like a video camera stream.  Nope.  Once you upload, it's clear the images aren't as high quality.  When I was created a DVD and used video from my old camcorder files (which broke, hence getting this camera) and the files from this camera, well, there's no comparison.  HOWEVER, the photos are awesome and perhaps all video files from digital cameras aren't as good as a real camcorder.  Anyway, overall VERY happy with the camera.", "Date": "July 18, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Captures up to 80 minutes of continuous video with audio, or 5-, 15-, or 30-second clips\nManual shutter speed ranges from 64 seconds to 1/1000 seconds\n6.1-megapixel CCD captures enough detail for photo-quality 14 x 19-inch prints\nFeatures all-glass Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon 3x optical zoom and 4x digital zoom\nHigh-speed, low-light, autofocus system gives you the best possible shots under a variety of situations", "Name": "Kodak 6.1 MP EasyShare Z760 Digital Camera & Series 3 Camera Dock", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31JAG2QB81L.jpg", "ProductID": "B000EHJNRA"}}
