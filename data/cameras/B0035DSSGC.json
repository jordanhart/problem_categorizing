Came in a thick plastic bag, I removed the product, the rubber shielding around the wire was nice and thick, better than most bag/box pre-terminated wire out there.  I hooked it up to a camera I had for testing, it never even powered on.  Checked things out, turns out the BNC portion of the cable wasn't even touching the inside termination.  Once I cut the head off and re-terminated , worked fine.*sigh*", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Won't Fit", "Author": "Michael Gardner", "ReviewID": "R2744HY68OPSUE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The bnc connectors must be from Mars.  They do not fit any connections.  It seems like the pin connector in the center of the bnc is of a too large diameter.  The cable seems very good as does the power connector.
