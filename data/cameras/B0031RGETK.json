An amazing waterproof camera!", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R19R8B8SZPSU8T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This thing really does all the things Olympus claim. The photo quality is just so-so though. It's not ever worth taking 12MP photos with it so I have mine set to 8MP. Like so many high MP cameras today, the lens just isn't good enough to capture the detail - and what do you expect for a $200 camera that's waterproof? However, it does allow you to digitally zoom that bit further and the video is great. It's unfortunate that the video format is not standard, and doesn't work with anything or any software I've found so far. I'm sure they'll fix that at some point.Other gotchas...The battery life is very poor - but I found some higher capacity compatible batteries on Amazon that were very cheap (like 2 for under $10) so I'd advise just buying replacements.The menus are a little confusing and at first it can seem that you're limited and the camera can't do certain functions, but it actually can if you figure out why certain features are restricted in certain modes. The camera has a very unhelpful message like \"Not supported\" that it will display - but doesn't explain why the mode you're trying to select is not supported. It will take a thorough read of the online instruction manual to figure this out, but don't give up and you'll figure it out.Apart from that, I'm very happy with it. It won't replace my 'land' camera, but it is awesome for snorkeling, boating, and swimming. Here's a video I took with it last week in Maui.

Here's the deal. If you're such a pro, why are you using a hundred dollar camera? For all you shutter jockeys out there reviewing hundred dollar cameras, STOP PLAYING WITH THE SETTINGS! It's a point and shoot!I bought the Stylus Tough 3000 PURELY ON PRICE POINT to replace a Stylus 1030 SW that is aging.... The 1030 SW is three years old, and believe me, it's been used and abused in and out of pools, saltwater, sand, drops, and you name it. I never had it sent to Olympus for waterproofing maintenance , so I won't submerge that camera anymore, but I did for almost three years, and it still works, and I would take it in rainy or wet conditions with no qualms. I gave it to my daughter and she uses it. It takes great pics on auto setting if you know how to use the focus. It still takes great shots.I am a little disappointed there is no retracting lens cover like on the Stylus 1030 but, I haven't had it long, and haven't seen what abuse will do to that part. However, I was used to using the focusing feature on my old 1030, and this one is very similar. I like it. It takes sharp photos in different scenarios if used correctly. When it arrived in the mail, My daughter and I took it for a test run in the shallow waters around my home town..... I took underwater photos of various things at depths of just a couple feet. I took multiple pictures at macro and super macro, and normal modes, underwater and in the open daylight, with and without flash, and with different flash settings. It was partly cloudy, so I had opportunities to shoot full sun shots of my daughter, wildlife, etc. in shady or sunny conditions... We spend the day wading, playing in the sun, and taking pictures. The camera stayed in my pocket, even while wading in belly-deep waters. I wouldn't normally swim all day with it. I was just giving it a trial run, basically to insure it will perform over it's life as advertised so I can send it back now if necessary.The battery is the smaller one, and that I dislike. I don't mind charging it with the USB as others have complained about. I am lucky to have USB adapters for everything, but I can plug it into the car, my computer, someone else's computer, a wall, etc... It doesn't charge so fast, but hey.... It's a hundred dollar camera. Plus, you can get dock chargers for these batteries pretty easily and cheap. Buy an extra battery or two as well if you want to use it all day.The Stylus Tough 3000 has more internal memory than the 1030 SW, so I was happy about that, but had a limit as to the amount of pics I could take on it. However, it still took about 75 shots on the 12MP setting, which I don't normally use. Normally, I'd use 5MP on the 1030 SW, I will probably continue using 5MP because even that is too large to print from almost any normal printer at it's native resolution, and it's much larger than most computer screens. Why waste the space if you aren't using them for a professional job? Anyways, the internal memory isn't bad at all, even with firmware taking up much of it. I have a 16GB SDHC card on the way.Obviously, the seals held for the day. It turned out that out of the 75 or so pictures I took, about 3 of them were unusable and blurry, maybe ten of them were just acceptable for most computer screens and had some different anomalies and such, but the rest were brilliant. If you factor in human error (which is a BIG factor in these reviews), I think that is pretty impressive for a hundred dollar waterproof camera. I have a decent sized (23\") monitor, and they look great on it. I have pics all over my Facebook, and everything. people comment on how gorgeous the pictures are from both Olympus cameras I've used.I Only used the automatic settings for the day, as well. What's cool about it is it has different automatic settings for different scenarios. It even has a feature for stitching together multiple shots into a huge panoramic, even a 360 degree pan. I tried that, and didn't do it correctly, but if I had, it would have been a great image. I just had to figure out what to do, that's all. after viewing the file, I saw where I erred, and could easily create wonderful pan shots now.I haven't used the video yet, but on my 1030 SW the video is not good. Not good at all. However, I've seen video taken with the Stylus Tough 3000 online, and I was fairly impressed. I wouldn't expect to get different results from this camera.My last Olympus is still getting abuse and taking good shots after more than three years.... I'm more impressed with the images this new one creates. I just hope it will prove as sturdy as the last one. I see no immediate reason why it shouldn't.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "great for a \"tough\" camera~", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2050CN2HH8PTE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this camera specifically for a kayaking trip we were going to do on vacation.  I wanted to be ableto have a camera that could get wet, possible go underwater, be durable enough to withstand being jostled and of course take some nice pics!!  We are NOT overly tech savvy, but had no problems running the camera in basic daylight/scenery functions.  The battery lasted all 6 hours of our kayaking tour, but was dead by the return to the hotel, I used it ALOT though in that time.  I did turn it off during periods of non-use though in effort to save battery.I do consider it a downfall to have to plug the camera in to charge, but now that we know we like the photos it takes we are going to invest in extra batteries to have a backup.I took probably 200 photos of scenery, animals and underwater shots.  The water was crystal clear, and could see clearly with the camera at least 10 feet underwater with very high detail...i'm guessing it would go a bit further but that's not what I was focused on at the time.  I have beautiful long-distance landscape shots of the water and mountains in the background, everyone who looks at our photos have been in awe that they were taken from an \"underwater\" camera.I did not try the video mode.Also did not try to take photos at night.I've recamended this to friends, and am very happy with our purchase and the chance to use it again as our children get older and we(hopefully) go on more water-based trips!", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "So bummed.", "Author": "T.

This camera has to be plugged into a computer to charge and the battery doesn't last long at all.  I bought an extra and charged it and they both died one the first day of my vacation. When it turns on (takes a while) it is in a program mode so you have to change it unless you have it set to exactly what you want. Every single time.  The picture quality is awful.  I just went through the High Sierras and do not have one good picture.  I am not slow when it comes to cameras or technology and this is so frustrating.  What a waste of money.  I will only be using this when there is a chance of getting very wet.

I liked the idea of this camera.  Admittedly, I am spoiled by using my pro equipment all the time.  I find this camera slow to focus and not great for the action shots.  The LED screen is hard to see in the sun so you really don't know what you have until you get home and load them up.  The worst thing is that it soaks up the battery faster than anything I have ever seen.  Don't leave home without it fully, I mean FULLY charged.Now with all that said, the pictures that do come out in focus are great and it does do a really good job with the actual underwater stuff and I love the fact that you can take video underwater, so much fun!Will I use this as a replacement for all my family pictures, absolutely not.

It's very difficult to navigate out of and I cannot figure out how to keep it from being the default program that opens whenever I put in a photo card or plug in the camera.  It somehow has installed itself on both of my memory cards - the one I use for my cannon photos is now infected with this software!While I'm sure it's a wonderful program, most of the time, I just want my raw files.

With that in mind, it works great! but there are a few caveats..Battery life is limited especially if you shoot in HD.

Especially if you just got it wet just a small drop in the front mic assemply/hole will muffle sound.Lense get dirty really quick with water spots. Altho zooming is mechanical, it does get fuzzy due to water spots on camera or dirt particles. also expect it to not be shake stabilized when zoomed. Like most digital cameras, you can't zoom in while recording. I suggest a tripod espcially while using night vision/firework setting.Go with 4gb class 6 or higher SDHC cards..As for editing, I use Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9 and it works great!

This compact, and powerful little stylish bubble camera has been the answer to everything that I could possibly ask for.When Digital Camera's first came out onto the market my very first camera I received was a little digital Olympus from my dad as a gift..I bet it was something like 5mega pixels or something - but and I loved it too. I carried the little thing everywhere telling my story in self portraying photographs...Then somewhere along the lines I decided to take a photography course and upgraded to a Minolta DIMAGE A.2. The BEST on the market at that time (this was in 2004). It was 10 mega pixel SLR and I spent $1100 on that camera.... I hated it. I still dont really know how to use it. Not to mention that Minolta has now become extinct - so I couldnt even buy parts if I wanted to. For YEARS I had this Minolta this BiG honkin' piece of machinery.... That I simply hated carrying around...Now its 2010, and it was time for an upgrade. Really I was looking for a new still camera that I could compact with me everywhere I went, but there was a catch. I wanted video capacity and HD preferably... Something Cute, and not to expensive...Then TaDa! This little stylus perked up its little face on Amazon.com. Now the first thing that attracted me to this little Olympus was his price...he was comparably priced at approximately $200, and of course because I once had a Olympus before that I very much loved, we instantly had a connection. Then he continued to tell me about himself...\"I'm waterproof\" he said seductively. \"You can carry me around with you, anywhere, and we will have an amazing time...you'll never have to worry about me because not only am I susceptible to water, up to 3 meters... but I'm also Shockproof\" he said cockily to me. \"I'm a Stylus Tough, and I'm one of a kind.\"How could I not fall in love with such a wonderful little camera?But before I could commit to him; I need to feel him, hold him in my hands and KNOW for sure that he was the one for me. So I looked around looking for my prince charming camera. I met many other camera's in the process... but none of them were stacking up to the stylus that I read about on Amazon.comThen Finally I found him! He came in 4 different colors to choose from, but I knew that I wanted him in Red. The clerk as he was showing him to me, was as charismatic as the camera, and I knew that we were a perfect fit. Today was the day that I getting my new little Olympus Stylus 3000!He was perfect to hold in my hand, and I liked that his lens was not retractable. To me, that was a feature that was less likely to cause me to send him away to the warranty hospital. His buttons on the back are rubberized and soft. Everything about this camera is fun and noninvasive. He has many \"magic\" features, and a wide arrange of capture settings such as `cuisine' and `pets'. My favorite setting is the pinhole, and popart in the magicbox. But you can also stencil and create coloring pages!The only downfall that I have about this little camera is uploading the video. The video feed is only compatible in Quicktime (MP4) and I have to convert all my videos in order to alter them in moviemaking which compromises the quality - quite a bit. And when you are recording video you cannot zoom. you can zoom before you start recording and it will work, but once the red little button has been pushed that's it! no changes missy! and unfortunately the features don't work in video either... so no popart videos :(Besides that, I highly recommend this Powerful little 12mp, Stylus Camera![...] Samantha is a part of what is arguably to be the World's Largest Internet Marketing School available.

We are having a terrible time with the battery, it takes 2-3 hours to charge it plugged into the wall...by computer you need to make sure computer is not on power save/sleep mode or it will not charge & after 1-3 hours of use our battery is depleted/dead again. I am waiting for a response from Olympus to see if our battery problem is typical or just a bad battery, because this camera has so many features and options to use, but if it's battery life is really always this bad it is really pointless for all the options, just selecting your options depletes the battery. I think it takes great pictures, the auto function & especially at 12mp. I took pictures of my 1 year old daughter on the swing and caught many laughs with the feature where you hold the shutter down and it will take pictures every few seconds until you release the shutter. On close ups you can almost see every strand of hair when we review them on the computer. Haven't tried it in the water yet, it was to cold to go swimming today.

If 1-3 hours per charge is all I am supposed to get, I think it is a bad purchase.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not what I was looking for", "Author": "Katie", "ReviewID": "R1S49LA1D7DOCO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this to replace my Canon powershot, whose flash stopped working.  I thought I did my research, but am disappointed in this camera.  Thought maybe once I got used to it I'd be okay, but I am planning to get a different camera.Cons:1. When you turn the camera on, it does not default to Autofocus, but Program. Since I rarely use the program feature, I have to manually switch it to autofocus, or explain to the person taking the picture.2. The pictures do not snap very quickly. I am taking pictures of a new puppy and a 4 year old and most of the time, I end up with the tail because by the time it clicks, the puppy has run off! I cannot take 2 pictures in a row either because there is a wait time.3. There is no paper manual. Maybe some people do not read the manual, but I like to refer to it. The manual is stored on the camera.4. If the battery dies when you are not at home, you can't do anything about it. It has to be hooked up to a computer to charge. So be prepared with a computer and connector anytime you take your camera with you!5. The ib software does a lot of neat things, but not what I really want. My first digital was a Kodak Easyshare, and it is much easier to use than the ib software and you can do a lot more in terms of editing photos.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Olympus Stylus was a dud in the water", "Author": "triguytom", "ReviewID": "R1HH74D4PYUOFQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having owned several different brands of small digital cameras, I felt the need for another that was waterproof, due to the fact that I was soon to go on a cruise and planned on taking underwater photos of marine life while snorkelling....very disappointed.
