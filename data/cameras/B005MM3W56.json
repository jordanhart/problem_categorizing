This is a GREAT camera. Period.This camera is a little bigger than most point-and-shoot cameras, but it's not as big as I thought. It's light. There are a lot of shooting modes and it's easy to use.

I have owned 2 Kodak's and 1 Samsung digital camera in the past, they in no way compare to the Pentax!!!The first thing that I noticed about this camera is the quick start up.  My previous Kodak and Samsung cameras took much longer to completely warm up before I could use them to take pictures.  The Pentax Optio RZ-18 is ready to go almost immediately after turning it on, which is an important feature, so you don't miss what you're trying to take a picture of!Next are the settings, which are excellent.  I typically leave it on auto, as it does a great job of adjusting according to the surroundings and light, but when I do set it to a specific setting, I find that it certainly does its job.  Video capability is great too, the microphone, as stated in other reviews, is placed in a strategic area on the camera, so you pick up sound, but it is not muffled nor is it too loud.  There is also almost no lag time (small hiccups) when taking video, something I've noticed happens quite often with similarly priced (budget friendly) cameras.The LCD screen is wonderful, bright, big, and crisp images show up on it for you.  I also did not have a glare issue, even in Mexico outside by the pool in the hot sun!!!  That is a wonderful quality as well!The buttons are a bit small, so if you have big hands or long fingernails, they can be a bit tricky, but overall have not been an issue for me.The battery life is actually quite impressive as well.  I took this camera with me from our resort all the way out to Cozumel and the San Gervasio ruins and took pictures pretty much the entire time, and it still had plenty of life by the time we got back.  I actually ran out of space on my memory card before the battery gave out!All in all, I am EXTREMELY happy with this camera, and plan to hold onto it for as long as I can.  I am by no means a photographer or even a photo enthusiast, I just enjoy snapping photos of memorable moments throughout my life, and this camera fits in seamlessly with my life.  I would highly recommend this camera to any one looking for an inexpensive camera that FEELS expensive!!!", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Another great camera from Pentax!", "Author": "R. Alexander", "ReviewID": "R2PE6HWUS8DW9X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"Back in the days\" I learned 35mm photography with a Pentax K1000, and still remember their classic ME Super camera and superb line of lenses. So, while looking to upgrade my old 5 MP digital camera, this Pentax model caught my eye - and mind.I \"made the leap of faith\" and purchased the Optio RZ-18, and wish I had done so sooner!Some experts have determined that 16 MP digital cameras take pictures that may be printed at 5\" x 7\" as good as 35mm film pictures at that size. I have plenty of 35mm nature photos on hand in 5\" x 7\", and took the Optio back to the same places and began shooting....I'm still a die-hard fan of 35mm photography, so please keep that in mind when I state that the Optio did BETTER on all the photos I took in my comparison test! I printed my pictures on a plain old HP all-in-one Deskjet, using common matte finish photo paper. Color, contrast, and resolution on EVERY picture were better than my 35mm equivalents, although that may reflect on the film lab I have been using.I doubt if the Optio would beat 35mm in a 8\" x 10\" or larger comparison, but still would have been acceptable for general use pictures at those sizes. But since 5\" x 7\" is my most common print size, the Optio has effectively replaced film for most of my shooting.What I miss with the Optio: number one would be a real viewfinder, coupled to the lens. The LCD screen on the Optio is a weak point, completely washing out when strong light is behind the photographer (where it should be, right?). Number two, the display on that screen doesn't do justice to the lens. I was happy to discover that my pictures showed more color and contrast on my computer screen when I was preparing them for printing, and they also printed better than the camera's screen would seem to indicate!Battery life on the Optio is so much better than any other digital I have owned (at least 8 or 10), that I still don't understand how Pentax accomplished it. I put the Optio away for the past few months, and looked at it to help me write this review; the batteries are still at 3/4 charge, right where they were when I put it away. Thinking the battery life would be like other digital cameras I have owned, I purchased a car charger and spare battery, but now don't think I will be needing them.My Optio has a quality feel to it, and user controls are intuitive; I barely glanced through the instructions. A beginner would appreciate the user-friendliness of this camera, and the more experienced photographer would appreciate the more advanced features the Optio offers.No, the Optio is not going to replace any good DSLR cameras for serious digital photography, but its' compactness and light weight make it the better choice for general picture taking. Now, if someone at Pentax could just create a viewfinder for the Optio, I might be able to revise my rating to a full five stars for this still excellent camera!UPDATE, 1/2/13: This date I installed a FlipBac accessory viewfinder on my Optio, and initial indoor testing of that device is favorable; images in the FlipBac were better in at least several cases than those on the camera screen. Please see my review of the FlipBac for more information. After using the camera outdoors in strong lighting, I'll update this review, but it being early winter that may be some time later!", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do Not Expect Customer Service", "Author": "Sgtbob14", "ReviewID": "R3PNPPLEXM1MEA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a Father's Day present. Pentax has had a great reputation in the past, so I thought that they still performed like they used to.  Alas, this is not the case.  Everything was great for about three weeks and then the camera would shut down immediately after turning it on.  I called Ricoh-Pentax and they told me to send the camera in because there was no fix they could give me, and until I prodded them, I was going to have to send it back at my expense, and it would take 15-20 business days to fix what should be replaced.  Well, that was a month ago, more that twenty business days.  They still have my camera, and I need it for travel next week. What is going on? How long does it take to fix a camera, or to replace it?

I wanted a pocket camera with a good zoom, and it does not disappoint there.  There are a variety of modes to choose from, and the super close up is phenomenal for a small camera.  Very light weight.  Flash is iffy and you need to watch your fingers - you may be covering it.  You can buy a remote for it and take group photos and be in them.  Minuses for me = really, really bad panoramic.  It does not stitch the sections together seamlessly.  Also, the charger comes with a (too) long cord and is a nuisance for the traveler.  I ordered a plug-in charger and that is much better.

I have read comments about the cheap look of this camera, but if you get it in black, it actual looks pretty cool.

I have taken about 100 pictures in the last week and I really like this camera.The pictures are sharp and the colors turn out well. What I really love about this camera is the display and the interface. The display is very clear and sharp. It is very easy to navigate among the various shooting modes, and the intelligent auto function works well. If you want a basic point and shoot with a great zoom that is easy to figure out (without running to the manual every time you use) it then this would be a good choice for you.
