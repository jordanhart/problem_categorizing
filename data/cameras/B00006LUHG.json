I found a guy that was selling a half dozen of them from a business that had upgraded their A/V system (not ONeills-the one I originally purchased from them had a defective motor, but I got a full refund so no harm and Sam was very easy to work with).  Tested when received and it worked fine, so all was good, and since it's a backup, it doesn't see heavy use.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "High speed, wide range Pan/Tilt/Zoom color video camera\n12X optical zoom, high speed auto-focus lens\nAuto tracking and motion detection\nFull access to all camera functions through RS-232C control\nDate and time display generator and IR remote commander", "Name": "Sony EVID30 NTSC Color Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21KHQGCTG4L.jpg", "ProductID": "B00006LUHG"}}
