I also write books about photography.  I like cameras and own many different kinds, from medium format film cameras to super zoom compacts.  But I've been very interested in the whole category of mirrorless cameras for the two years.  I own three different Olympus Pen cameras, including the new Pen EP3, so it was a little bit counter-intuitive for me to pick up a Nikon V1 as well.  I was originally attracted to the camera because of the industrial design which (unlike just about every one else on the web) I like very much.  It's clean and to the point.  I like cameras with high resolution EVF's because it makes the process of shooting (and especially shooting video) seem very much like using the traditional cameras I grew up with.  I cannot understand the fad of holding a camera at arm's length and trying to compose a good photograph.  Just doesn't work for so many reasons.I've shot with the Nikon in the studio (using LED light panels) and outside for the last five days.  It focuses very, very quickly and with the mechanical shutter engaged it shoots at 5 fps.  You can also use the electronic shutter to shoot 10, 30 or 60 fps.  Amazingly fast.  The EVF works very well in bright sun and in low light.The camera is small and light and the video specs are very good as well.  There is even a high speed video mode that allows you to shoot very short clips at 400 fps.  When you play back at a normal 30 fps the footage becomes incredibly slow slow motion.  While the video lacks a bit of finesse in the audio realm the test clips I've shot at regular 1080i and 1080p are sharp and the color is great.  There is a standard socket for an external microphone and variable sensitivity settings in the menu.  Just not fine tuned control over manual sound levels.The two lenses I got are the standard kit lenses and both of them work well, provide great Vibration Reduction and seem sharp even when shot wide open.  I hope they flesh out the offerings to include some high speed prime lenses as well.The camera, when used with the electronic shutter, is 100% silent in operation.What are the flaws? 1.  You should be able to turn off the image review but you can't.  That means, when shooting in single shot mode, the camera will show you a review image after each push of the shutter which slows your shot to shot time down to about 2 seconds.  If you were able to turn off the review the camera is completely capable of shooting very, very quickly.  In the continuous mode there's enough shutter delay to throw you off your game if you've been shooting with a $5,000 sports camera.  If you are upgrading from a point and shoot, you won't notice it at all.  The cure is to go electronic and set the camera for 10 fps and then shoot in bursts.  No lag and you're pretty much guaranteed to catch some peak actionThe menu is much less detailed but much more straightforward than the menus in the Olympus Pens which is both good and bad.  The Nikon is easier to learn (especially for people coming from Nikon SLR's) but the Olympus menus give you more fine control over just about every setting.I've had great luck with the images that come out of the camera.  The jpegs are well exposed, full of good detail and the colors are right on the money.  Just as good as the \"famous\" Olympus Jpegs.  I'm waiting on Adobe to implement the new nef raw files into ACR and Lightroom so I can start shooting raw files.  You can use the supplied software for now but the workflow is so much slower I just can't stand it.I'm certain that Nikon will do well with this system because it's quite a huge step up from cameras like the Panasonic LX-5 or the Canon G12 and lets you interchange lenses.  When they add a pro model and an ultra wide angle the ball will really start rolling.For me it's the new \"compact\" camera.  I take it with me everywhere and it takes great images without much intervention on my part.  Is it as good as my Canon 5Dmk2 or Canon 1DS mk2 full frame cameras?  No.  The files aren't as detailed and they don't have the same sense of depth.  But the iSO of the Nikon is close to my 1ds2 and that camera was $8,000 only a few short years ago.....If you are a parent and your kids play sports like football and soccer this might be the ultimate camera for you.  It's easy to use and the longer zoom lens is sharp and locks focus quickly.  Coupled with a fast frame rate and you fix all the stuff that cheaper DSLR's and point and shoot superzooms tend to muff.I just wish they had supplied the flash in the same shipment as the cameras....I want to try using it as a trigger for my studio flashes.The mirrorless cameras represent a new direction for camera makers and I think, for users as well.  The handling and image quality is more than enough for most of the stuff we want our cameras to do.  And the Nikon is in the same league with the m4:3 cameras from Olympus and Panasonic.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the sensor size open minded", "Author": "Kodachrome man", "ReviewID": "RK5JRZCX3RM9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, Amazon - please limit reviews to those that actually own what they are \"reviewing\".  I consider Amazon reviews a good resource but do not like having to wade thru the worthless gripes of non-owners that better belong on camera forums.I am a certified professional photographer and use Nikon and Leica \"full frame\" equipment for my commercial and portraiture work.  However, for my daily walks I often want to use a good compact camera which was a Lumix LX5.  I have used a few images from this camera for a gallery I sell in but find that in the large print sizes (20\" or so) the small sensor just does not quite get it.  So I have been looking for a better compact camera and was pleased to see the Nikon 1 system with a somewhat larger sensor.  After reading some reviews I decided the weight, size,  and lack of control did not make sense for me.  But after reading an open minded and knowledgeable review by Rob Galbraith I changed my mind.  As to the size compared to larger sensor cameras he actually compares them with lenses' on the body, unlike other reviews, and it shows that it is indeed very compact in comparison.  He also compares the simplicity to Apple design, which being an Apple computer convert, caught my attention.  Some reviewers confuse the simplicity of the control layout with lack of control and that is a false assumption.  The black body is also a very nice, simple, elegant, designI bought the 2 zoom lens kit from Amazon, and liked it so much I bought the 10mm lens a few days later.  I was even lucky enough to find a flash.Some initial thoughts:- Yes it much bigger than my LX5 but not too big as a larger sensor system would be for my use.- Focus is at least as fast as my Nikon D3 and fast glass, and exposure is almost always right on.- I use the camera in aperture mode, and it is very fast and easy to change aperture, and you can do it while looking thru the viewfinder.  I prefer it to a dial.- The menu is very well done and I like that it stays where you last used it.  For instance, if you just changed the ISO, if you want to change again, just hit the menu button and you are at the ISO line, no searching thru the whole menu again.- Preliminary thoughts on lense's - the 10-30 is soft in the corners wide open, but have not tried it since the recent firmware upgrade.  The 10mm is great!  The 30-110 is fun - such a long range in such a small lens.  It seems quite sharp but not much testing yet.- Just got the flash today.  More good thinking by Nikon - has bounce and rotates and is light as it requires no batteries.  Exposures made inside, bounce and direct, look nice and even.  It of course will take down the charge on the camera battery but one of the good things about the \"chunky\" body is it has room for a large battery- Having the flexibility to change lens on a compact camera is super.  Today I had a lens on the camera and a lens each in of the pockets of the light jacket I was wearing for my walk and the lens in the pockets were so light they were barely noticeable.- Looking forward to the adapter for my Nikkor 50 1.4 and 85 1.4- Great camera for fast, from the hip, shooting.  The LCD can easily be turned off, the viewfinder is off until you bring it to your eye, so you can leave the camera power on for a fast grab shot without draining the battery- Lenses do not go on with the quality feel I get from the D3, the 10mm even feels a little rough- Glad that Nikon had the courage to start an all new sensor size - it may not be for everyone but is exactly what I was looking forThat is all for now, will update this review as I learn more about the camera system.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor man's Leica M9", "Author": "ZeitgeistSolo", "ReviewID": "R1K2TDMAE8FE7M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has freed me from SLR bondage. I understand now why many pro photographers sold their high end DSLR's and bought a Leica m9 rangefinder digital. Four years in development, this camera hits a grand slam for Nikon and I believe it's a game changer.Forget the armchair quarterbacks bemoaning the small sensor. It's good enough. Better than my d200 and about on par with my d300 without going under the microscope.The genius of the 2.7 crop is the tiny, tack sharp lenses. Yes, they're a bit slow but that's what the higher ISO is for. This camera has a useable 3200 speed. The lenses probably have in-camera correction for various aberrations since you cannot see any chromatic aberration. none. Even wide open. They are sharp, sharp, sharp. Again, I think with the processing power available that this camera applies barrel and pincushion correction. Just my humble opinion.You have HD video. You have 1200 fps slow motion. There are a ton of cool gadgets here. Leave your video camera at home? Well, no, if it's a high end Canon in the $3k up range. But if you've forgotten it, you won't feel disarmed. In firearms parlance, this is an excellent backup to your real weapon, and it's in a major caliber.To fully \"get\" this camera, order the 10mm fixed prime. You then have a tiny, pocketable powerhouse that forces you to work on framing and composition. If you have dabbled in photography for 35 years like I have, you will understand what Nikon was going for with this camera-  freedom. No heavy body and gaggle of lenses in a bag. I bet you'll shoot much more, since you'll have it with you. The first rule of photography is to have a camera with you.You can fully control this camera. It's not as easy as it should be. Going back to full auto takes too many steps. But it can be done. It's almost as if the camera is forcing you to slow down and think about what you're doing.Build quality is amazing. I own Rolex watches not because they are accurate, but because they are amazing mechanical devices that are impeccably built and engineered. This body exudes that quality. The lenses are plastic, and so a bit of a letdown tactilely, but movement of the zoom is fluid and feels expensive. I hope someone makes a Leica M adapter for these bodies; they deserve nothing less.Nitpicks? Lack of short depth of field. That's it so far.Will housewives like this? Yes. But there are other cameras cheaper that will satisfy them. This is a camera for someone who already understands photography. One who owns many SLR and DSLR bodies and lenses. One who knows what a camera can do. But one who is looking for freedom. Freedom from menus and buttons. Freedom to express and grow.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's the Little Things", "Author": "D. Bannister", "ReviewID": "R2UAP2084I70IQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When this camera was first introduced the negative comments overwhelmed the photo sites; the sensor was too small. No grip to speak of. No traditional Program, Aperture, Shutter, Manual and Video selection dial. Motion snapshot what the heck is that?!!! No internal flash. And on it went.I purchased a Fuji Finepix X100 last year. A fine camera for someone willing to spend the time with it. But quirky for me. There were so many things I had to check before taking a picture I felt I was flying a plane and not just using a camera. And although firmware updates have improved the speed of the focusing it still is not anything to write home about.Enter the Nikon 1 V1. I find the V1 menus well laid out and responsive. Oddly the selection dial on the back of the camera is smaller than the X100 but it is more responsive and easier to use. Want to delete a picture? Press the delete button and press it again to confirm the delete. You do not have to take your thumb off the delete button and press the OK button to confirm as you do in other cameras. It is the little things like this that only a company like Nikon, that has been dedicated to the photographer, can get right.Startup is almost immediate. On the X100 there was a wait if you were using a slow video card. The V1 does take a few seconds to wake up if it has gone to sleep so if it is a long time between shots it is best to power down and power up again.The built quality is simply excellent. The camera is well balanced and seeds nicely in your hand. It is not weather sealed so use with protection in variable climates. The EVF is superb. Better than the X100 but the reviewers say there are better viewfinders out there and I am sure there are but this one is pretty darn good.Presently I use the 10mm f2.8 lens. It is great. I would have preferred a faster lens but this is the fastest of the lot right now. It also takes up the least amount of real estate on the camera. There is a mounting attachment you can buy for the camera called a FT1. It enables you to use your DSLR Nikkor lenses with the V1. It is expensive but I have tried it at the store and it is amazing. A list of compatible Nikkor lenses can be found on the Nikon website and only Nikkor S lenses will be able to take advantage of the automatic focus but it extends your camera. Also the 2.7 crop factor of the sensor means that a 50mm DSLR lens becomes a short zoom of 135mm on the V1; a 30mm DSLR lens becomes your 80mm portrait lens.The speed of focusing is beyond any mirrorless camera out there. It is astounding. Half press of the shutter and snap you are there. No hunting. No whir as the lens tries to find the sweet spot. Pop it is there. There are always exceptions to focusing - out a window, monochromatic surfaces predominating etc. But for general purposes, day-to-day you will not find a better focusing camera.It has three shutter modes - manual, electronic and electronic (hi). If you are in place where the shutter sound is distracting you can silence the camera in the electronic shutter modes. You can set the shutter for a single shot or continuous. In manual it shoots 5 frames per second and buffers after 10 to 14 shots. The electronic shutter speed is beyond silly but to get that prime shot while watching a sports event it will not let you down.The menus and options are very extensive on this camera. For me there is nothing lacking. As with any camera I find where the features I use most frequently are and practice setting them. No matter the dial or menu configuration I can change settings quickly. For instance on the V1 scene, programmed, aperture, shutter, and manual priorities must be set via the shooting menu but leaving the menu pointer on the Exposure Mode option means I can change modes very quickly; not dial quick but almost.In one of the forums someone was lamenting all the shortcomings (as he saw them) of the V1 and as often happens said they were going to wait for the V2 which he was sure would address these issues. A veteran replied he couldn't wait for the V2 and that he wanted to grab a V1 before another version was introduced as he was sure the V1 would become a classic. After having this camera for a while I think he is right. The camera is excellent and for many it will become a classic, if not broadly, then certainly for Nikon affectionados.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Day 2 with the V1", "Author": "Gur Kimchi", "ReviewID": "RY4ORPD93UN9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing little camera.  I am no expert, but I do often lug around a 5D with giant white 28-300 lens, and while this is not in the same class, it comes so close, and is so much more versatile... as a pro-photographer friend told me many years ago: the most important feature of a camera is to HAVE IT WITH YOU!  This is compact enough (esp. with the fast 10mm aka 27mm prime) to be with me at all times, and the quality is every bit (to my non-pro eyes) as good as the Likes of the 500D or the NEX-5 (I tried both for extended periods).Given I struggled between waiting for the NEX-7 and the V1... The focus speed (shooting kids running around FAST, Skiing with the Camera and being able to get high fps sequences, great video) was critical, and as promised it's phenomenal - esp. considering what a compact package it comes in.  Build quality is SOLID... I guess this is as close as one can get to a Rangefinder experience without spending MUCH more money.  I am happy :-)The final decision between this and the NEX-7 is between choosing flexibility, speed and price (V1 wins, as far as I can tell) vs. overall resolution (and maybe low-light quality), where the NEX-7 probably wins.  I played a little with the Panasonic 3/4th family and prefer the Nikon - better speed, focus, flexibility... and build quality.UPDATE: to make sure no one is confused - if your biggest worry with a Mirrorless is Auto Focus, this review and the V1 is for you.  if your top priority is image quality and AF performance is less critical, get a NEX...the image quality is good - even great in the right situations, but clearly other cameras with much larger sensors are better re absolute image quality, this is why my *other* camera is a 5D.UPDATE2: check out this article, I agree: (...)", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best camera for family memories", "Author": "J. Wilder", "ReviewID": "R3I6M35OKCH28B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have high-end full-frame DSLR gear and have shot indoor sports part-time professionally.  However, I've realized that most of the memorable moments of my little girls have been captured with my cell phone.  This is tragic, but as they say, the best camera is the one you have with you, and I just can' t be lugging a DSLR around everywhere.So I've been looking for a compact camera for years that would be able to acceptably capture kids in normal room light without a flash.  Technology seems to have finally gotten there and I debated between this, the Canon s100, the Panasonic GX1, and the Sony NEX 5n/7.Size:The size of the Canon S100 was certainly much more attractive, being able to slip it into a jeans pocket.  However, this can still fit in jacket or cargo pant pocket with a pancake; or easily fit with a zoom in wife's handbag or pouch on pack or stroller.Stealth:As soon as my kids realize I'm shooting them, their precious moment is ruined and it's, \"I wanna see, I wanna see\".  So shooting in normal room light without a flash is key, and also the ability to shoot without a shutter sound.  The S100's low light image quality without flash is arguably passable, but the Nikon's is just so much better.  I'm not aware of being able to shut off the shutter sound for any of the other cameras.Focus:This is where the Nikon really shines with its phase-detect autofocus.  This is no big deal if you're shooting landscapes or bowls of fruit, but is really a huge breakthrough that seems to be underplayed for shooting active youngsters.  All the other cameras, even most DSLRs, spend too much time hunting during video, with the subject frequently going in and out of focus.  The Nikon's ability to keep things in focus is remarkable, even tracking multiple faces when shooting video.  The Sony was particularly bad at continuous focusing, constantly wobbling in and out (with lens noise while doing so), and often missing the moment.  Capturing the moment with acceptable image quality trumps missing the moment with great image quality every time.Sensor size:People tend to focus on the negatives of a relatively small sensor.... the theoretical lessor low-light image quality, and the larger DOF.  But there are a number of advantages.  The first being the larger DOF.  I appreciate nice bokeh as much as anybody, but for  capturing moments, I want to be able to shoot with a fast prime, say f1.2 or f1.4 (in order to get lower ISO/higher shutter speed) and get BOTH my kids in focus, and even some surrounding area for context, especially for video.  Second, longer reach from standard prime sizes.  Not sure if I'll spring for the F-Mount lens adapter yet, but being able to reach a gymnast from the bleachers with an f1.4 would make a DSLR jealous.  Third, smaller file sizes.  Half the size of the GX1, effectively doubling the capacity of memory cards and SSDs (which aren't cheap).  Also makes for twice as fast per-image transfer.Image quality:The Nikon's image quality was quite a bit better than what I saw from the S100.  When looking at raw image samples in Aperture, I found the high-iso detail between the V1 and G3 (proxy for GX1) to be pretty close, despite the G3's larger sensor and 60% pixel advantage.  That indicates a lot about the sensor technology advancements being used in the Nikon.  Also, the Nikon images consistently looked great straight from the camera, whereas the Panasonic consistently needed +2/3 stop exposure compensation and a hue shift.  The Sony's low light performance seemed to be about 1-2 stops better, which was its main draw for me.  It was hard to say for sure because Aperture didn't support Sony's RAW format.  Also, Sony's color seems a little too reddish for my taste.Lenses:Sony's lenses are on the large side, and pricey.  At the moment, m4/3 seems to have the best lens offerings, with a well-regarded Olympus portrait prime, a 40mm f1.7 pancake for around the house.  And a powered zoom that's even smaller than Nikon's yet has powered zoom and power collapse.  That's compelling.  However, the rumored/leaked Nikon roadmap looks pretty good with some fast primes on the way.  Fast primes are really key for this Nikon, in order to get away from the high ISO indoors.Video:I like being able to capture full res snapshots while recording video.  I don't think any of the other contenders can do that.  Uses a video format I can play directly on computer and various devices without having to convert (as I would with AVCHD from the Sony).  Nikon's video generally looks great.  No \"jello effect\".  The 60fps progressive is great for shooting kids and sports.  Noticeably smoother action, and gives the option to do slow motion, which is nice for incorporating into slide shows.  S100 and Panasonic can't do this, NEX can.  Nikon can also trim videos in-camera, which is nice for freeing up card space before you get a chance to dump.  Warning, though, you have to do this well before the card is full, because it takes temporary space to edit.Flash:Compact flash disconnects and stows easily.  Allows for bouncing, even in portrait mode (unlike NEX), which gives more pleasing results than straight-on flash in dark environments.  More power than any built-in flashes gives much better results, yet so much more convenient than full size speedlight.  The ease of use of the flash is really nice.  No extra batteries to deal with.  No waiting for charge.  Can leave it turned on and it shuts on/and off with the camera.  Always gets the right exposure no matter the bounce position, ISO, etc.  It does lack power to bounce off particularly tall ceilings, but upping the ISO helps that.Gripes:The V1 pretty well attains the benefits of DSLRs in a compact size, but one area that is more \"compact\" than DSLR is the shot-to-shot time when not doing continuous.  It seems to be somewhere around 1.5 sec, and requires a little care in timing the half-shutter presses (1 to get out of the preview, and a 2nd to focus).", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "get this camera now while you can", "Author": "laylarath", "ReviewID": "R3PPCOJXDH4X7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been either a photography student, professional photographer, and/or photography teacher for the past 18 years. I learned on a fully manual film camera and still use my beloved Nikon FM2 film camera a lot. Of course, back the film days, I had an F5 for when it seemed necessary, but I am a petite woman (under 5' tall) with small hands and the F5 was chore to use. When digital sensors came out I was disappointed to see them only go into the large SLR bodies. I have always wanted a digital equivalent of a fully manual SLR. The smaller, lighter, plasticy \"prosumer\" DSLRs seemed like a poor compromise to me. I was hoping the new mirrorless cameras would fit the bill. I read a lot of reviews, went to stores to hold various cameras and settled on this Nikon. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now, shooting in a lot of different conditions and I am very happy with the camera.This is the perfect camera for a photographer like me. I am not a gearhead...as long as the image quality is sufficient, I am happy. I need a camera that works like a screwdriver, not a supercomputer. This is not a camera for a gearhead or a lazy photographer. I would think it could also be a great camera for an enthusiast or amateur wanting to learn and improve. The camera is beautifully designed, feels great in the hands, and the controls are intuitive and responsive. With the electronic shutter, stabilization, and no mirror, I can successfully handhold the camera at a half second shutter speed with no camera shake...pretty cool! Those who complain about the lens selection can buy a converter for use with larger Nikon lens. Those who complain about a lack of \"grip\" can buy an attachable grip from Amazon ($30 for generic, $70 for Nikon) but I see no need for it. Some reviewers complain about having to go into menus, but I don't find it problematic. You can easily use the auto exposure and auto focus locks to avoid having to change many settings in the menu. Who needs to change ISO in a split second anyway? (Again, this is coming from someone who is comfortable with a fully manual film camera, so take my opinion with a grain of salt). I have had no problem with the flash connector cover coming off as others have complained about. The battery life is great, the viewfinder is great, and the camera is very fast. It is easy enough to use that I can put it auto mode and my husband can use it with great results.Looking at the new V2, it seems that the gearheads may have already killed this great camera (like they kill so many great things). This new design has been \"improved\" to address the complaints of reviewers (translated = gearheads). I prefer the design and simplicity of the V1.

I have the V1 with the 10-30 and 30-110 lenses, the flash, and the F mount adapter.  I've only used the camera a few times - but earlier this week had a chance to try it for golf photos at the Masters.The electronic shutter is a wonder - I'm able to stand a few feet from a golfer and throughout the setup and backswing, I can photograph at will.  These are shots that just cannot be taken normally - they are simply not permitted.  But with the V1 they are not a problem as the camera is completely silent.I'm still getting used to the differences between the V1 and my Nikon DSLR's.  The controls are a bit different, but generally presented in context so the interface is pretty easy.  If you are n Still mode, you have a different set of menu items from Movie mode.I found Auto ISO generally did not work for me - I wanted a higher shutter speed than was permitted.AF was fast and accurate.  The exception was the face recognition tended to pick up background faces in the crowd if the subject was not facing the camera.Electronic High mode for fast frames and movies worked very well.  Golf is a perfect place for ultra- high frame rates.The size was very compact and easy to carry.The 10mp RAW images are quite good - excellent color, matrix metering produces very good exposures, and noise at base ISO is acceptable.At higher ISO levels, the image can be a little noisy.  Not bad but don't expect to shoot this camera at ISO 1600 without noise.For a DSLR user, there is more learning curve on the V1 than picking up another DSLR.

The thought of having them stolen there was enough to motivate me to find an alternative system. I decided on the Nikon V1 with the 10-30mm and the 30-100mm as well as the flash (which is a no brainer), a 50mm 1.8 (which I barely used), and the adapter to fit Nikon lenses. I also brought my Nikkor 24-70mm 2.8.The good: This camera with the Nikon 1 lenses is a fantastic video camera with excellent auto focus! It's small which is great because people are not intimidated by it and you don't have to lug around a huge camera/lenses all day/night. As for the focus, it's very good in daylight; it struggles and tends to hunt a bit in darker situations. Image quality is very good as long as you don't get camera shake or have a fast enough shutter speed. Battery life was excellent, I took thousands of images daily and only once didn't make it through the day. There are plenty of options in the settings that will give you full creativity with shutter speed, aperture, and a host of other settings so you have total control over your images. I love the flash because it uses the camera battery, is very small but works excellent.The bad: I got very frustrated with not only the shutter lag but also camera shuts off after time, which caused me to miss some nice moments. Being used to a D3S, this is obviously and adjustment and not something everyone will run into. The Nikon 1 lenses are sharp but the 5.6 aperture is a bummer for me as all my Nikon glass is 2.8 or faster, so another adjustment. ISO was a little grainy at 3200 but I actually liked the look it gave these specific images of Africa, on the gritty side. With the adapter, you can strap on any Nikon lens but you lose a lot of functionality like continues focus, the ability to move focus points so that kinda of sucks in some situations, especially for video where you pretty much have to use the Nikon 1 lenses. Shooting in manual mode is a bit strange, it was not real precise, you can move the shutter speed 2-3 stops before the meter will start to move, so I stuck to aperture priority most of the time.All in all, there wasn't a single day that I would have traded my tiny little V1 for my D3s and big heavy lenses (although there were a few moments I would have liked to have my pro gear).

The kit lens is just fine for most activities where I need lightweight but it is my camera of choice in many close-up or telephoto situations, a D600 or D300 for IR Black & White otherwise. I pair the 1V1 with a prime for quality. The older AIS (manual focus) and AF lenses are superb with the 1V1/FT-1 combo. A welcome addition is the new firmware that allows AFC focusing for the AFS lenses. So new additions to my kit in the Nikon line will most likely be in the Nikon 1 family.............I have been using the 1 V1 for about a month now and am approaching 2000 images. I also have a D600 which I ordered from Amazon the day it was released. To put into context my review I would point out that I am 70 yrs old and an avid hiker/photographer carrying a camera around in the Southern Appalachians or the Rockies sometimes 30-40 miles a week. I have been shooting DSLRs since the film days and Nikon since 2003. Lightweight gear and quality photos is important to me.I say almost DSLR level images because at the dynamic range and resolution of the camera the images from the 1 V1 are last generation DSLR in the Nikon line. I own a D300 and my comment is based on comparing the specifications of the 1 V1 to this camera. That said the 1 V1 images are to me of the same quality as my DSLR images. I must clarify this because clearly the D600 at 24mp with about 3ev more dynamic range and better noise performance will out shine the 1 V1 on most any image comparison I have done. But down sample an image for use on the web as compared to making a big print and wow I find myself saying \"now which camera did I use for this picture?\" And I have to look at the exif file to see. For me this is the answer to the question of quality.As for handling, I am in love with this little jewel. Oh yes I would rather have the iso changeable with a dial and the other dials us advanced amateurs like, but is it worth $400 for these features that can be found on other models.....not to me. Most of the time I am shooting aperture priority with a manual prime lens. So I only need to turn on the timer or change the iso or the exposure bias. I find myself mostly having to go to the menu system to change the iso.Finally the 2.7 crop factor means that I will normally carry this camera with the 10-30mm kit lens or most times with a lightweight telephoto such as the 85 or 105mm F-mount Nikkors or my favorite lightweight, the micro Nikkor AIS 200mm f/4. On a bright day I expect to be able to hand hold the 200mm and shoot a small bird at 1/10,000 to 1/12,000 sec f/4-5.6 at ISO 800 -1600. This is a 35mm equivalent of 540mm. For more reach and auto-focus I can add the TC17 and the heavier Nikkor 300mm f/4 and still hand hold the camera. This is 1377 mm in 35mm equivalent angle. This bright little low noise CX sensor with an electronic shutter that can go to 1/16,000 sec and the Nikon FT-1 is the magic of the Nikon 1 brand.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "The camera I've always wanted!", "Author": "Rick96 \"NikRic\"", "ReviewID": "R1JROB0UKI6D2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the past few years I've bought 2 P&Ss;(high end), a bridge camera and a digital SLR. I was not happy with any of them.  We go to Myrtle Beach for a month of so in the winter and our son and his family visit us there for a week each year. When on the beach the view screens of the point and shoots are washed out by the sun so it's impossible to see what you want to photograph. The Bridge camera had a viewfinder but did not have the speed I was looking for. Last year I decided I wanted  something with an EVF(electronic viewfinder) and fast performance. I looked at the reviews of the Nikon V1 and believed them, they were mostly negative, so ended up getting a DSLR and a few lenses. What a mistake. It gave me the performance I was looking for but it was too heavy and awkward to carry to the beach or for a day in Charleston or elsewhere. I started looking again at the Nikon V1 and found that a lot of the reviewers had changed they're minds and decided this was a pretty good little camera. On paper this camera was what I wanted so I bought one. WOW!! This is the camera I've been wanting for 20 years. It gives me all of the performance of the DSLR, even a little more when it comes to auto focus speed and burst rates at full image quality. It's too big for my shirt pocket but it fits into a windbreaker pocket easily or is not uncomfortable on a strap around your neck. The lenses are small and lite enough to fit in the other jacket pocket, so you can carry the camera an extra lens the flash and a spare battery on you without a bulky bag or backpack.I've had this V1 for about a month now and am just thrilled with it.

Nolle \"NetTraveler\"", "ReviewID": "R1XVVZ3E3M0J93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My goal for the Nikon 1 V1 was from the first a DSLR replacement.  I've been a user of Nikon DSLRs for a decade, and I've got a lot of Nikon lenses to show for it!  The problem is that I have too many for some trips; adventure travel isn't a place where you can change lenses so if you need just the right lens you end up with a DSLR back for each one.  That's a lot of bulk and weight, particularly for lenses you only need for special situations.  My normal shooting is with a D7000 and 80-400mm VR lens and I had a D200 with a 17-55 DX lens for closer work.  The problem was that the lens zoom range ended well short of the 80-400 and the D200 is a big and heavy body.  I decided to try the Nikon 1 V1 as an alternative to buying another D7000, and I also got my wife a J1 at the same time.The camera is much more solid than you'd think from the pictures; it doesn't feel chintzy.  The standard kit lenses (10-30 and 30-110) work fine, probably at least as well as the standard kit lenses on the D3000 or D5000 series.  Since the Nikon 1 has a smaller CCD, the \"focal multiplier\" is 2.7, so the 110 end of the zoom is nearly 300mm in 35mm terms.  My wife uses the kit lenses exclusively and in most shots it's hard to tell the difference.If you want to mount a \"real\" Nikon or Nikon-compatible DSLR lens, you need the FT-1 adapter, which provides not only the fitting of the lens but also a place to attach a tripod or strap.  DO NOT put one of the big lenses on if you plan to hang the Nikon 1 around your neck on a standard camera-back strap, or use the wrist strap!  It will put too much strain on the mount.  I got a BlackRapid RS7 to use as a strap; it can attach to the FT1 or to the tripod collar of a big lens.  Up to about 200mm the FT-1 mount point seems fine for a strap, but heavy lenses will hang funny if you don't use the lens collar as the mount point.The D200 is a 10MP camera just like the Nikon 1 and I hoped to get equivalent pictures, but the Nikon 1 did MUCH better.  The ISO range on the Nikon 1 is 100-6400, while the D200 only went to ISO 1600.  The extra ISO headroom is great for wildlife shots, and digital noise at ISO 3200 (the top end of the auto-ISO range) is better than the D200 at ISO 1600.  With a touch of noise reduction, all the images I've shot are fine even at ISO 6400.Two recommendations on the camera if you're a DSLR shooter.  First, set the exposure mode to Manual or Shutter Priority; Program Mode isn't useful with Auto-ISO because you can't really control the shutter speed and with the normal DSLR lenses (which are typically longer focal length) the 2.7 multiplier on the Nikon 1 makes hand-holding difficult.  Second, SHOOT IN RAW MODE!  There is an enormous difference in image quality between JPEG and RAW.I liked the first Nikon 1 V1 so much I bought a second one, so now for wildlife trips I hope to have one permanently mounted on the 500mm and one on the 17-55, which turns out to be a great walkaround lens for the Nikon 1.

When I bought it, I sort of had a buyer's remorse, because I felt like I was buying an overpriced point and shoot, small sensor camera.Now, having shot with it for a few weeks under several weather/lighting conditions, I am honestly impressed with its performance. I have been shooting mostly with the 10mm lens since it is the only lens (at the moment) that would make the camera more or less pocketable (in my winter jacket). It's also fun shooting with it. I've been using the EVF most of the time. One thing that annoys many users is the camera has no option to turn off picture preview after a shot's been taken. It really doesn't bother me because if I need to get that \"moment\" I would shoot with \"electronic (high)\" shutter and shoot away at 60fps.While the camera is overall impressively responsive, one thing that does slows down the camera is the \"auto power off\" mode that is set to 30-sec by default. If camera's not used for 30 sec, the green light blinks and puts the camera in some sort of sleep mode before turning off. To \"wake up\" from the sleep mode, it takes about 3 seconds of so by pressing any buttons. I have missed shots because of this. There is also about one second lag to activate the EVF. I wish the EVF could be turned on all the time.Another annoying thing is how loose the \"multi accessory port cover\" is. It comes/slides off very easily and I can see it getting lost one day. Now, the third annoying thing is how easily the mode dial turns. More than often, when I take out the camera to shoot, the mode dial is set to movie from getting moved around.Anyway, from my experience using the V1, it feels like the camera was meant to be for the photographer who cares more about the photo than the camera's technical specs. It's a user-friendly camera that gets (most of) the job done. I also see it as a great travel-camera because it's well-built, small(ish) profiled that can be carried everywhere, and the image quality is perfectly fine for the web and 8x10 prints. Perhaps the V1 might disappoint pixel-peepers who shoot with full frame or larger sensor cameras because it's not as \"sharp\" or detailed as an image that's been shot with a larger sensor on a high quality lens, or those \"bokeh lovers\" who want shallow depth of field. I've posted many pictures on Flickr using the V1--flickr(dot)com/photos/soelin/", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent compact for fast action. \"Enthusiasts\" look elsewhere.", "Author": "Mikhail Arkhipov", "ReviewID": "R1G8QYJJQCD5V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon V1 is a niche camera and it is not for most \"enthusiasts\". This is camera with much larger sensor that typical compacts, with 10/2.8 lens it fits into a pocket. It is the only compact camera with phase detection autofocus and is very suitable for shooting moving subjects, read: kids and their games. Due to much larger sensor it also does much better in low light that your typical compact. Enthusiasts complain about lack of manual control dials, etc - so if you want one, V1 is not a camera for you, go get Sony NEX or 4/3 camera or new Canon G1X. However, if you want to make a nice gift to your wife who does not want lug around DSLR but wants high quality pictures of kids, this is the camera to get. V1 has excellent mode that takes several pictures in succession and then picks 3-4 best shots automatically. Optional flash is tiny and yet it can be tilted for bounce flash. Add zoom for video and you are all set for a soccer game. And don't forget high fps video mode so you can get action in slow motion.V1 is also one of the few compact cameras with viewfinder. If you have to wear glasses when reading, framing on back LCD screen is a pain. Viewfinder is so much more convenient and V1 sports excellent EVF.It is also a good camera for a street photography enthusiast since it is absolutely silent, fast and autofocus is excellent in normal light and does very well tracking moving subjects. Now, if you want DOF control or best possible low light performance - look elsewhere.

It has a view finder, little of the traditional external controls in more expensive cameras, plus it does not support traditional Nikon flash units.  For me these areas are the most important.I recently started shooting video with the FT1 adapter and various Nikon and Sigma lenses.  I have to say the 1080/60 frames per second is nicely done and makes for top notch video. It gives the extreme magnification to four video at a much lower cost than elsewhere. You do get a 1200 frames per second, at a very reduced resolution, but it can produce super slow motion of very high quality.Image quality: I find no fault with the sensor or image quality.  I think It does a great job for what it is.  Being larger  APS-C, 4/3, Full Frame sensors will create higher resolution images.Biggest gripe deals  if you change settings much:  The control system is menu based and if things like having to change your ISO range is important you dig around in the menu system.  There is no alternative to digging! NOTE:  There is one external control a toggle switch which I leave in Aperture priority to change F Stops.  This leaves shutter priority to the camera.  SO DO I MISS EXTERNAL CONTROL?  NO,  Was the blogging press and blogosphere upset about this? YES!  Does it matter? It PAINS ME TO SAY THIS as I still shoot other cameras(Nikon D7000  and 3 view cameras shooting 4X5 sheet film)  in manual mode --NOT AT ALL!  This is the crux of this camera.  You have to live with the default settings most other cameras allow you to have control over. For the few controls this camera has and you need to decide if having control at your fingertips is important to how you shoot.  I would down load the manual make a check list of camera controls you actually use and see if you have to have them at your finger tips.  For most photographers the answer is probably no.The last used/selected menu setting will come up when you next access the menu system I switch between color and monochrome so can do this change over easily.  I would look over the menu settings to see if you can live with Nikons choices to see if they match your shooting style.Gripe # 2:  There is no internal flash and existing Nikon compatible units wont work or do TTL.  There is no flash adapter for other nikon or 3rd party flashes.  If this is important to your shooting you are forced to buy the external  flash currently at $150.00. I happen to use radio remote triggers - pocket wizards- and  there is no work around for this you have to live with weaker flash.  If this is not important  today that's fine. if you are a Strobist shooter or will start using flash units you can only trigger external flash units opticially with the propritary V1 flash.  I have Nikon SB 800 and 700 external flash units and they don't work with this camera. There are NO adapters and Nikon does not seem to have any plans to make adapters.Lenses selection:  Nikon seems to be releasing fairly good quality zoom and prime lenses making this into a system rather than a product.Other likes which are reflected in my personal shooting style.Electronic shutter is totally silent and I have used it in documentary situations to avoid shutter noise.Continuous shooting is very fast.Electronic View Finder.  Works great and I don't miss mirror based systems at all.Small compact light weight. With an extra zoom lens you can carry a system in your pocket and not have tired shoulders at the end of the day.Same battery as my D7000 a big plus.  Extra bonus the battery lasts a long long time.  Did I mention it lasts a long time.  After using this camera with its extreme battery life I can't emphasize how important this is. Its longer than all other mirrorless cameras.Fastest auto focus bar none.  You can pan and get autofocus too.I Reciently bought the F adapter to use F mount lenses with this camera.  It makes my 70-300MM consumer grade lens - with a 2.7 crop factor- into an 810MM lens.  For extreme telephoto work this is a big plus.  Think about using a cost consumer lenses shooting at F 4-5.6 - which are nearly as sharp as pro lenses at these apertures - and having an equivalent 800 MM lens for almost no money!Dislikes. It takes 2 seconds to turn on and you will miss some \" in the moment\" shots.You can't turn off the required picture review.  Personally I always turn off pic review.  That way I can't chimp and chimping leads to missed shots.  If the shot is bad, camera shake for example, you can't fix that and its best to keep shooting and throw away the extra shoots both good and bad.You will miss shots while paging through the menu system.  Better to set an forget for the style of shooting you do.Sometimes shooting backlit subjects you get silhouetting due to the camera second guessing what you are trying to shoot AND that lack of override manual controls means you will miss some shots.The money issue:  For $300 its worth it.  Would I upgrade to the V2 for $900?  Probably not.  With the discounted price I am able to take the extra money and buy other lenses.  In my case I bought a 30-100 zoom- used for $100 dollars  and now have a pretty complete system.  If future releases come up with a flash workaround I may be tempted to upgrade if the steep discounts happen again.The other Money issue:  An entry level Nikon 3200, 4/3, or Canon equivalent is more camera better sensor more controls than the V1.  It has more accessories and may have more versatiltiy in terms on video, flash 3rd party accessories now and in the future..  You have to decide if bigger, more options, and more to carry is worth it.The Functionality Issue compared to other Mirrorless cameras.  The Mirrorless companies do tend to lower prices to clear inventory for older models. When I ordered my V1 I also ordered my Wife a Panasonic Lumix G3 for the same price at the Nikon V1.  I have to say the Panasonic G3 and G5 offer more of the traditional controls found in a DSLR type of camera. More external buttons means more control.  The touch screen of the Panasonic is first rate much better than any other camera manufacturer's interface plus it's completely customizable.I feel the Lumix has more of what traditional cameras offer in terms of control, functionality and sensor technology.  Plus you do get a build in flash with a hot shoe for more powerful flash units.  Here is the Money issue all over again.  The V1 and Lumix G3 were the same cost.  You will probably see the Lumix G5 discounted once the G/GH6 are released.  If I were to do this over again I would probably go with the Lumix because of my personal shooting style -remember I do lots of manual controls over my shots, and the Nikon is clearly behind the Lumix in terms of functionalityA strategy is to wait till Nikon dumps these units and jump on the bandwagon when pricing looks good. This happened at Christmas 2012 and if it happens again you won't be out much money.  You could do the same for other Mirrorless cameras too.Final comment from something read years ago about a seminar dealing with Leica shooters.  The award winning photographer was asked about one lens over another- Leica quality remember- and his answer was Leica Smica go take pictures.

I bought it mainly due to the current price reduction, portability and promise of fast shooting speeds.I shoot with a dslr APSC, a dslr full frame, a micro 4/3 and a variety of lenses. I am tired of lugging around the dslrs for shooting my kids, and the micro 4/3 (a genius of a camera) is not quick enough, even in manual mode.I never have been a believer in the megapixel myth, so its megapixel count was never a concern. I also shoot with certain point-and-shoots that can produce pictures that rival cameras that cost 5x as much.I have grown to love it. It does what Nikon promises - incredibly fast shooting times for a non-DSLR. It fits in my coat pocket unlike my DSLRs, and it is fast enough to capture action and freeze it.There are many complaints about lack of adjustability - that is only true for those who need to shoot and adjust settings fast. Maybe I am biased from using the x100 (which makes one pause and deliberate a little while shooting), but aperture, speed and ISO are only a few clicks via the control button on the back. This has so far never been a drawback. I go into each photo shoot knowing in advance what I want, and I have the camera ready.That being said, if you leave it in auto (I tried this 10% of the time), it is quite reliable and produces quite good pictures - better than an advanced point-and-shoot, and it is truly fast for a camera of this type - I really felt a DSLR-like response although that is obviously a slight exaggeration. It's speed-vs-its-small-size is its main selling point, in my opinion.If you want something more than an advanced point-and-shoot, and want to snap your kids, this is a godsend - slightly bigger and blazingly fast - so fast that I am picking it up more and more than my other cameras. Have not tried the other Nikon lenses for it, but that can only be a bonus.It is also very fun and a pleasure to use.Pros:  - very fast (fastest in its class?)  - comfortable  - fun to use  - nice viewfinder  - very nice image quality for a small sensor  - very portable without a bag/case  - at around $ 350.00 = $ 400.00, it is a stealCons:  - not suitable for large image prints  - not suitable for pixel counters  - macro function leaves a bit to be desired (attach a loupe and it works quite well)", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Nikon V1 is sturdy and versatile little beast [updated after 1 year of constant use]", "Author": "alf randell", "ReviewID": "R1SIUYJXRNSA9U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the Nikon V1 wide angle kit for some months now. I shoot candid photos, and landscape panoramics. This machine was designed to perfection for my needs. It's very simple looking black body does not disturb people, and they relax very quickly after noticing it. Maybe it looks enough like a cell phone with the very small 10mm prime lens attached.I chuckled about it's manual shutter until I tried it. The sound and slight vibration of it's operation give me valuable tactile input. It also seems to give better results. The 5 frames per second continuous mode is about right for gentle action like rock climbing or changing facial expressions.I have been shooting raw frames, and am very satisfied with the sharpness and color saturation that the cx sensor is capable of. The kit lens has some distortion, which can be removed easily. The 10 mm prime lens captures images that are good right out of the camera. Also, this prime lens has no moving parts on the outside. It is suited to our desert air, which is burdened with dust. It does not change length, so once it is attached [hopefully, in a clean location], it has no way to draw dust into the body.The 10 megapixel limit of the sensor can be daunting. I shoot my landscapes with 3 to 30 overlapping frames, ending up with a huge image that can be printed out mural-sized. So, the 10 mp frame is plenty of resolution. I benefit from the speed of the camera, because I have to pivot the camera on the tripod, and trigger it multiple times with the remote, all before the clouds move very far. If you must do this with a single frame, you will have to spend quite a bit more for the body and lenses.As far as build quality, this model is very strong. It looks simple and pretty, feels like a little brick of solid metal in the hand, and operates like a miniature professional camera. The electronic viewfinder is perfect for eye level operation in all conditions, and the screen works very well when holding the camera at arms length, or using it on a tripod. I have never once wished for the screen to tilt, or accept touch commands. I prefer sturdy build and simplicity to wealth of features.The menu system works well once you find everything. I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of full manual operation. Shutter and aperture each have a control. There is an exposure indicator, but the live view does not reflect the exposure chosen. You have to snap one to see where you are at. It is better to use manual focus for low light landscapes to prevent focus seeking. Then, you must remember to switch back to auto, or all subsequent shots will be blurry. There is a warning in the evf and on the screen than you are still in manual focus mode, but there is no external switch to remind you.The external flash is a must if you will face low light, and it works really well without requiring it's own batteries. It swivels in many directions, and throws enough light for nighttime gatherings and to provide fill flash of flowers and portraits and pets. The 18.5 mm f1.8 lens with the small 'innie' hood works very well with the flash, as the coverage is very even at this focal length, the focus assist light is not blocked, and enough light hits the sensor to focus easily. I am glad that Nikon did not include a pop up flash on this model.In short, if you like simple, durable devices, and you do not require more than a 10 mega pixel sensor, this little camera [and it's surprisingly sharp lenses] might be for you.update after one year:I have been shooting the V1 pretty constantly for the last year. I learned a lot about the wonderful machine, and do not regret my choice in any way. I have added the 30 - 110 mm zoom, and the 18.5 mm f1.8 prime, and really can't say enough about the sharpness and color and contrast of these optics.The long zoom has uncanny ability to cut through distance haze, and remains contrasty and crisp in difficult lighting conditions like strong backlight. The huge lens hood is an absolute must for anything but night shots. And, as i feared, the lens's huge range of expansion brings dust into the interior, where is makes the action raspy. I have not noticed reduced optical quality, but i think that primes will last much, much longer than zooms in dirty or damp environments.The 18.5 is the perfect normal lens, and I am never tempted to attach the 10 - 30 mm kit lens with the 2 primes in my bag. The exception is macro stills and video, where the kit lens focuses well, and the active Vibration Reduction compensates for hand shake or tripod jiggle. An example is: [...] is a 4 minute beekeeping documentary  that i shot with the kit lens and a spindly tripod.I have not dropped the camera onto a hard surface, but have used it for roped shooting of rock climbing in high winds, and rainy hikes. It has taken many blows without any complaint, and has worn 2 system bags to tatters! i get lots more usable video footage and sharper stills than with other camera models that I have tried. [And, i get less tired holding it!]As far as processing is concerned, The lens profiles are available from adobe, by downloading the newest dng converter. One should not even look at the raw images [especially those of the crazy sharp 18.5 mm] without applying the lens corrections. Once corrected, images from every lens are evenly lit and free of distortion and fringing. They are very suitable for automatically stitching together. You will have to use this technique to print huge images from this small sensor. holding the camera vertically, and shooting 3 overlapping shots left to right gives you a single horizontal composite image that could have come from the D 800 E.I have ordered the 20 dollar fotodiox f mount adaptor, and plan to experiment with legacy glass next. I have the 75 - 150 zoom, and will order the renowned 50 mm f1.8 manual focus prime as well. Sports should be quite impossible with manual focus and exposure, but the sunsets and night shots are already done using a tripod, and with manual settings. I will order a set of extension tubes with the 50 mm lens, as these old optics might make pretty good macro lenses. You will see a detailed update to this review after my experiments.Once again, if you are worried about the postage stamp sized sensor, I suggest that you order a 300 dollar V1 body and the 18.5 mm prime lens. Give it a week or 2 to get used to it before you start forming your opinion. The menu system and the fast prime are both a little hard to use at first. To shoot single shots rapidly, you have to press the shutter halfway down when the annoying preview appears. Other times, it is relaxing to evaluate the preview for a few seconds without the hurry. You will get many many great action shots by using the 5 frame per second manual shutter and a fast SD card. The clicking of the leaf shutter in the lens seems to give a better result, and the right amount of sensory input for your timing. You will get the expressions that you have always longed for by shooting people at 10 frames per second with the electronic shutter. It is silent, and there is no hint that you are shooting. You see a sort of movie of the shots that is useful for composing, but neither subject or photographer gets much sensory input.The One Year Verdict?This is the best candid or street camera available for the price. One routinely gets strangely great video, and crispy, focused stills for panoramic compositions or smaller sports shots. It is a pretty good macro camera for birds and bees and such. You will be limited to about a 2 foot print with a carefully processed 10 megapixel shot. You WILL need a larger sensor to obtain the shallowest depth of field, take very long exposures [without noise], or to print out a mural from a single still. you will need the weather sealed model [the AW1], and one of the 2 O-ring lenses to go under water.And a final warning. The lenses for this system are cost effective, but they are addictive. It is hard to stop thinking about and ordering new optics. And, you will not experience much benefit from the new lens mount if you do change the lens! This is a strong, growing system, and it appears to be here for the long haul. It is for folks that love light and photography and portability, and not so great for those that love to compare complicated gizmos. It can be with you at all times, freeing you from the agonizing 'take or not take' choice! Thanks for reading!On using the manual focus, manual aperture lensesI have used 3 of the Nikkor ais lenses with the V1 at this point. I have been using the fotodiox adapter, which has it's own tripod mount. The lenses can be carried in ones bag with the adapter attached and a spare series one rear lens cap to seal it up.I have written detailed instructions for using the manual lenses with the fotodiox adapter in my review for that product. So here, I will talk about what the legacy glass does to the systems usability.The 50 mm f1.8 ais is a must! Attached to the adapter, it is roughly the same size as the 30 - 110 mm zoom collapsed, and maybe twice the weight. The first element is deeply recessed, and can be used safely with no hood. It gets absurdly sharp images that compare favorably with those obtained using the 18.5 mm f1.8. And where that is a 200 dollar normal lens, this is a 135 mm equivalent of the same impressive speed. and, It will cost less, even with an adapter and a metal hood. I was worried about finding my own exposure without any help from the camera, but the V1's rapid shooting speed allow one to fine tune their exposure in 30 seconds or so. What you see in the viewfinder is adjusted, but the review that shows up after the shot reflects the recorded exposure. A peak at the histogram is sometimes needed. Manual focus turned out to be much easier than expected, even without viewfinder magnification. You can focus before closing the aperture for precision, or after, to control the depth of field very carefully. I get about 70 - 80 % crispy shots, so I shoot some extras.the 75 - 150 f3.5 E lens covers the next range of focal lengths. It shoots like a fast 200 - 400 mm equivalent. Because one is only using the center, it is sharp from edge to edge throughout it's range. You would think that a lens with this much magnification would not be useful without VR, But some low light sports shots quickly cured me of that confusion. I had some blurry shots from my poor panning, and some focusing errors, and a decent percentage of crispy raw images. These early manual lenses are very small and easy to handle, and use standard 52mm filters and hoods. Once you mount the long lens on a sturdy tripod, focus carefully, and stop the lens down, every landscape shot is perfect. The sharpness and contrast are extreme, and the color is different than the 1 lenses, but great! The lack of auto-focus and auto exposure is a benefit for landscapes. The cost is a tiny fraction of what one would pay for a 'modern' lens, and the build quality surpasses any plastic lens by a mile. Get this lens for 60 dollars, and if you can not focus it, it will be the coolest paperweight that anyone has [or, you can throw it at this reviewer!]the 43 - 86 f3.5 ais is the first compact zoom lens that Nikon ever made. It is still an amazing short telephoto on the 1 system, and a handy portrait lens on a dx or fx sensor. You get the idea. You can have a handful of the cheap adapters, and a big bag of sharp, fast manual glass for the price of a modern plastic zoom lens. I have ordered more adapters, as well as extension tubes and hoods. The next lens that i will get is either the 200 mm f4 ais or the 300 mm f4.5 ais.

WOW were we wrong.  Nikon has outdone themselves in their two latest introductions to digital photogrqaphy.  I much prefere the V1 over the J1. The J1 does not have a viewfinder and comes with a smaller bettery and no accessory shoe. the V1 uses the long life - EN EL15. The Nikon 1 CX format is x2.7; thus 10mm is equivalent to 27mm on a standard FX or 35mm SLR). It's is a revolutionary change, designed well, user-friendly, and easy to operate with high-quality Nikkor optics.  This is the camera that can fit in the pocket, sit unobserved on a tiny gorilla t-pod and capture some fantastic candids, or just put on the fixed focus pancake 10mm lens, wear around your neck, use a remote - no one is going to notice or hear the 'little thing'. You'll love the BRIGHT electronic viewfinder, that shows the image you just took until you again press the shutter button. This mirrorless operation not only makes it quiet, but is faster than greased lightning, and I haven't even touched on the V1's superb video capabilities.  I use the 10-30mm (27-81mm) lens 85% of the time. It's nano-sharp, with a short and easy zoom barrel, and focuses down to 8\" throughout the entire range......I love this little TOY!

And if you don't believe me about the NIKKOR lens quality:  check out [Nikon Rumors and imaging.nikon.com] for the tests performed with the REVOLUTIONARE D800 (Which I have and also highly recommend for the fine art photographer) I have shot with Hasselblad, Arca Seiss, Sinar, and some of the best German lenses and I am here to gobble up all my near-sighted predictions:  Nikon optics withstood the 36MP PLUS test with flying colours.

I am quite disappointed with the camera. In particular, there are several shortcomings I have discovered. The Nikon firmware update I installed did not work - there was no way to install a compatible firmware update for the lenses, and consequently the LCD screen stopped functioning even though the camera part of the firmware upgrade installed with no problem. I knew what the problem was, but it had to be sent back to have this done. Also - the cover for the accessory shoe does not click down and seat well, and I have already lost one and had to replace it - I predicted this as soon as I saw the way the cover fit on. The lens cap also is easy to lose. There should be some kind of tether to both these pieces. Finally - the camera is not user friendly in available light and I had to buy the extra flash attachment. I don't understand why there isn't an integrated flash on the camera as is true for most other cameras of this class.

The Nikon 1 is superior to my SLR in every way. It is lighter, more flexible and easier to handle. It has a much faster exposure rate which is handy as I have grandchildren who run cross country. I've taken pictures of them I never could have with my SLR. I rarely have an out of focus exposure as the focus is very fast.Negatives? A person with big hands might have trouble with this as the controls are miniaturized from an SLR. It is not easy to do manual shooting. I haven't tried that as everything auto has been great (I understand most photojournalists shoot on auto most of the time). Also, a professional would need more flexibility that this camera would provide. The flash is expensive for what you get, but works very well.I am an aging (Ok, aged) hobbyist, so this camera is perfect for me. If you are after a camera that will take better pictures than a point and shoot, and you don't want to fiddle with exposure and shutter speeds, this is an awesome camera.

I have taken over 700 photos using the automatic mode (programmed) and the results are outstanding.  I even shot a motorcycle race using shutter priority with speeds of 1/1600 and 1/2000 of a second letting the camera make all other settings with great results.  I particularly like the electronic viewfinder (EVF), which is super sharp and provides the aperture and shutter speed when using programmed mode.  At age 52 my eyesight is failing (I wear reading glasses) and I can no longer use an LCD screen and determine what is in focus and what I have framed without difficulty.  I have not had an out of focus photo with the V1.  I also tried the Sony NEX-5N in the store without an EVF and I was not comfortable with it.  The Sony NEX-5N looks like a great camera, but I would have had to spend another $350 for the EVF in order for it to work for me.  I have not used the V1 indoors and I do not have the flash.  I plan on using my Canon Digital Elph for indoor photos when needed.  I have been shooting Raw and using Adobe Lightroom 4 on my MacBook Pro to process my images.  Lightroom has taken considerable time to learn, but it has been worth it.  The V1 comes with Nikon's ViewNX2 software which provides very good results as well, but seems slower.  The camera allows you to shoot both JPGs and Raw simultaneously, which is a good option for those who want quick results from JPGs, but might want Raw files to work on at a later date.  The camera has a strong battery that provides 400 plus shots.  The camera is also much smaller than a DSLR, which is important to me. I think it is a great camera for outdoor shots, landscapes and travel photography.  For an honest review of this camera see \"Steve Huff's: The Nikon V1, The perfect street camera article.

If you are into still life almost any mirrorless camera will do, and you will probably want a larger sensor.  The Sony cameras give you the largest sensor, but they don't focus very well or very fast, they don't meter accurately, and auto WB is pretty bad.  The Olys and Panys are better all around than the Sonys, in my experience.  But none of them can touch the V1 for speed and accuracy.I have gone through a number of these cameras trying to find something that can augment my DSLR.  I was almost to the point of trying a small Nikon DSLR, and some reviews on the Nikon 1 weren't encouraging.  I have never been disappointed with a Nikon camera, so I decided to make the V1 my last gasp effort at a small camera.  I cannot tell you how thrilled I am with this camera.If you like to shoot things like birds in flight the V1 can do it better than any entry level DSLR and better than many upper level DSLRs.  Focus speed and accuracy are incredible.  If you have a subject moving directly toward you at good speed, you might get \"runned over\" but the V1 will get you a sharp picture of your demise.

The people who will like this camera more quickly are enthusiasts who understand the basics.  But don't let that frighten you.

And do you want 10 sharp photos of that in one second?  This is the only small camera that can do that, PERIOD.The camera does have some irritating characteristics.  All cameras do.

I planned to use the camera as a back-up of sort to my larger Nikon DSLR's.  I wanted something that i could stick in a small camera bag and use when i need to travel light.  What interested me most about the Nikon 1 system was the size of the camera/lens combo, the autofocus system, the EVF, and the FT1 adapter which would allow me to use my Nikon F mount glass.I also tried the Sony Nex-5n ( Sony NEX-5N 16.1 MP Compact Interchangeable Lens Touchscreen Camera With 18-55mm Lens (Silver)).  I was interested in the Nex mostly due to the larger sensor and the tilt screen.  To make a long story short i ended up keeping the Sony Nex-5n.I would have to say that the Sony won for me because of the following reasons;1. The image quality.  While the V1 is no slouch, i found the extra couple of stops of low light performance i saw in the Nex to be an advantage to me.  While the autofocus in the Nikon may have outweighed the low light advantage of the Sony, i felt that if i need something that can track a bird in flight i am going to grab my DSLR anyways.  For someone that doesn't own a DSLR the autofocus system of the Nikon would probably be more advantageous than the lowlight ability of the Nex.2. The tilt screen.  While i was looking forward to the EVF in the Nikon i found that i got more functionality from the tilt screen of the Nex.  I was nice to be able to explore angles that i normally don't consider while looking through the viewfinder of a DSLR.  Also, the EVF just didn't appeal to my eyes that much.  After looking through the OVF of a D700 the little EVF isn't that pretty! Also, i can add an EVF to the Sony but i can't add a tilt screen to the Nikon.3. The little scene mode features that i thought i would never use.  One in particular, the \"Hand-Held Twilight\", was handy.  While on a flight i tried taking a few shots of the city lights below with both cameras.  It is not an easy shot to take even with VR. Due to the slow shutter speed needed with the slow glass of both kits i couldn't get a good sharp shot with either...until i tried the Hand-Held Twilight mode on the Sony. I wouldn't say that my shots were perfect but man they were great!  The sweeping panorama mode is pretty neat too, especially for someone that doesn't feel like spending the time in post processing to stitch multiple photos together.So in summary:I can recommend the Nikon 1 V1.  I am giving the Nikon V1 4 stars because i felt that it was a great kit.  For some reason i just seemed to prefer the sony.  I found myself grabbing for it more than i did the Nikon while i was walking around with both cameras with me.  The only reason i didn't give the Nikon 5 stars was the controls.  I think that the they should have offered more customizable controls and more external controls on the V1.

Add to that the availability of tiny high quality lenses, many with vibration reduction, that are reasonably priced especially when purchased in used or refurbished condition.

It doesn't have the feel of a DSLR at this price point, but it feels as sturdy as an introductory DSLR.The controls are a bit inconvenient--some require access via menu. The image quality is good, but the high ISO is not fantastic. A strength is this camera's focusing speed. I was on a job where I needed light gear because I was walking a lot. I brought an Olympus E-PL3, which did fine when things were not moving. But the Olympus couldn't track moving subjects. The Nikon V1 excelled at this. For a compact camera, it is the best I've seen at focusing on moving subjects.I've read about the supposedly poor image quality, so I was expecting worse images. I was pleasantly surprised at the results. Yes, they are weaker compared to a D7000. However, they hold up pretty well when comparing images to older DSLRs.The price point is high considering many users want a grip, which I bought the Nikon version that is great for holding. Its only problem is it covers the memory card and battery slots.Some people complain about the lack of built-in flash, but it used to be flashes never came with a camera.

Richardson", "ReviewID": "R1YHK43AQXJCA4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really like this new Nikon design, but it doesn't look, feel, or work like any other Nikon I have ever used!I have been a Nikon user for all of my adult life.  I was introduced to Nikon products by a college professor in the early 70s.  He had a Nikkormat.  When I began working, I bought a Nikkormat FTn with an f1.4 lens to replace my Exakta SLR (great cheap East German camera).  Ever since, I have loved Nikons and appreciated their design and quality.  More recently, my vision has changed with age and I find that cameras with a live screen work better for me.  Unfortunately, Nikon hasn't really gotten it yet!  I tried the D300.  I love the camera but the live screen feature doesn't work well for me because often the camera moves during the actual shot.  That's not the case with my credit card size Casio.I ordered the new Nikon 1 VI hoping it would do the job.  It almost does.  It seems to have the Nikon quality but the design still has some serious flaws.First, Nikon has included an automatic feature that switches between the electronic viewfinder and the screen.  It is supposed to detect whether your eye is up to the viewfinder.  It's simply too sensitive!  The screen and viewfinder flash on and off at will!  With my bifocals, I have to get too close to the camera and it switches within 5 or 6 inches from the camera.  If there is no light between me and the camera, it switches even if I hold it a foot in front of my face.  Forget using it wearing a ball cap!  You can't shade the screen outdoors with your hand either.  They could fix this by adding a choice to the display button locking the camera in either screen or viewfinder mode.  The viewfinder is quite good but I find the screen better when things are moving.My second comment is only an observation.  This is not a shirt pocket camera by any means!  It's far too heavy and thick for that.  It would fit well in most backpacks or a coat pocket, however.  Even with the 10mm lens, it's too heavy for the shirt pocket.Although I usually take natural light pictures without flash, I really object to having to fork out another $150 for a special flash - especially when I already own a drawer full of perfectly good Nikon flash units.  Even if an adapter shoe were available, I suspect adding the old flash unit to the top of the camera would cause it to be unstable when trying to hold the camera for a shot.  It needs to be held by the fingers (not the palm) to avoid blocking any of the sensors if you have hands on the large side.  A small built it flash would be welcome.  Even a PC cord connection would be useful for those occasions when you must have extra light.If you have never used a great camera, I suspect you'd really like this one.

Wish I could just leave it on all the time  - After I take a shot with the viewfinder there is instant review in the viewfinder but not on the backside LCD. Very frustrating.  - Camera won't show what the current ISO is, it only says it's set to auto up to 3200 or something  - In fast shutter electronic shutter mode the camera starts making the shutter sound long before it actually starts taking pictures.  - I wish there was a more substantial grip on the right side.

I wasn't interested in spending a lot of money on lenses, but wanted a more capable device than my Samsung EX1. I bought a D5000 on craigslist and used it for a while but found its size to be outside of my standards of portability, and I resold it. I bought the Panasonic GX1 from amazon & the build quality just wasn't what I wanted, and my test shots weren't what I was expecting.I considered the RX100 but after years without a viewfinder on my P&S; I felt I owed it to myself to have an EVF (which is why I ruled out the NEX3-5). Adding a peripheral to a MFT like the GX1 or to a aps-c NEX series put those cameras into the bulky range, as well as increased their cost beyond their value. I was just going to put it off until I saw amazon selling the V1 used for $300. The price would theoretically allow me to buy lenses, and it had the EVF & yet was still on the pocketable side.So I pulled the trigger & I'm really glad I did: the V1 is sexy, featuring durable magnesium alloy body. It's lightweight, and the EVF is exactly what I needed. It's all very high quality, and yet portable as heck. The speed of the shutter actuation is really great and the 60fps continuous is amazing, even though I haven't been in a situation to use it. The quality, as far as I can tell, is on par with MFT cameras like Olympus & Panasonic.Additionally the lenses are inexpensive especially if you can find factory refurbished ones on eBay. And the upcoming 6.7mm lens looks like a must! As does the superfast 1.2 longrange lens, which doesn't have a release date yet.Wish list: the PASM wheel instead of whatever wheel you call what's on there, one or two customizable Fn buttons, and of course a light.Having said all that: I WOULD NOT buy this, or the V2, at full price. Never! I think $250-$350 for the V1 with kit lens is good, and $350-$450 for the V2 with kit lens is good. In my opinion, you'd be foolish to pay anything more. You can get the NEX-6, with more features, similar size, and nice EVF with a much larger sensor for $850 now (& used/refurbished for less than $800).", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still learning", "Author": "Monty", "ReviewID": "R33Y00TMTGUW07", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We received the camera and have unfortunately had to download an English user manual as the one we received was in Spanish.

This camera makes up for body size with compact lenses. I like that. This is my new \"belly cam\" \u2014 the camera I keep close in a belly bag when motorcycle touring and don't have the time or inclination of unpacking my DSLR.With the FT-1 lens adapter I get extra mileage from Nikon's latest f1.8 prime lenses. They give you some fast, small telephoto primes.  For example the AF-S NIKKOR 85mm f/1.8G becomes an effective 230 mm f1.8 prime. Not bad, eh? Two caveats: 1) if you use larger aperture DSLR lenses, you will see some clipping at the top and bottom of bokeh highlights, which is a function of the adapter design; and 2) the adapter doesn't work with some 3rd-party lenses. But what the heck? using the new 28mm, 50mm and 85mm f1.8 primes makes a darn good tele set, doesn't it?Also, this is a phenomenal video camera. The video IQ is more than pleasantly surprising to me, even after reading it was very good. It uses the full 1\" sensor and has no detectable rolling shutter effect. You will notice a bit of slowness to change exposure, which can be annoying. However with a bit of practice and planning you can work around it.I nick it a star for its cheesy dial and menu system, although I've learned to plan around that as well.At around $350 USD here on Amazon, this thing was a steal.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Katey Newman", "ReviewID": "R1KKRGGN3YYUNW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for myself for a Christmas gift.

So far, I've tried Sony's NEX 5, Canon's S95 and Nikon V1.  There are no doubt more on the market than these three.  But I tend to stick to the market leaders to make sure best technologies are incorporated into the units.  Of these, the Canon is the smallest since it is of the traditional pocket camera design.  The other two have interchangeable lens, which is what makes them so attractive as a replacement of SLR.  But for me they need to perform.I had high hopes for the Nikon V1, being a Nikon user all my life.  However, Nikon's decision to use a small sensor on these cameras just limits what they can achieve with this format now and in the future.  And it shows in the pictures taken.  I tried to believe Nikon can squeeze more out of small format than others, but in the end, the output do not stack up.  If this is the best they can do with the \"1\" series, I doubt more time will allow them to improve upon it.  In my opinion, the \"1\" series is destined for the attic.However, I was impressed by Sony's NEX 5, even though there are now many upgrades available (NEX 5n and 7).  The pictures blasted past the Nikon and shows improvements with each generation.  I just wish the lens would catch up to the body.  Sony needs to put out some high quality lens to match the excellent body.  The Canon S95 also performed well, although among these three, it is probably the lowest end.

I was wrong.This camera is too bulky to serve as a P&S; and the lack of a built-in pop-up flash makes it even bulkier and much less useful than a P&S.;I think Sony got it right with the RX100: same size sensor, truly pocketable, buil-in flash,... no wonder why the RX100 has outsold the V1 by such a large margin.Compared to other mirrorless system, it's clearly inferior. I had an olympus E-Pl1 and the benefits of the Olympus over the V1 are: built-in sensor stabilization that will work with *any* lens, bult-in flash, excellent filter collection (black and white and pinhole are superb), a large collection of very high quality lenses, and a shallower depth of field to separate your subject fron the back ground. I also currently have a Fuji X100 and the Fuji handles so much faster (and the X100 is a complex camera), and offers beautiful bokeh, excelent dynamic range, and magnificent jpegs.I'm very dissapointed in this camera -even though I didn't expect much from it. I bought it as a P&S; equivalent for my wife. But the quality is inferior. Time ago I bought 2 coolpix for my niece and for my sister in-law and both broke in a very short time.

I bought this camera because I wanted my wife to have a small, lightweight point and shoot that would render DSLR images on an automatic setting. I am very surprised at the low quality of this camera, slow operation, horrible flash, incompatible hot shoe (???!!) and bulky lenses. Here are the pros and cons of this unit:Pros: Small, great display (great refresh rate on the viewfinder) & same beautiful Nikon UI (user interface) that we have come to love over the years. Also, some complain about the camera not having Aperture , Manual and Shutter speed settings etc. They're there, they're just not on the wheel (where you are used to them).Cons: Flash! Don't bother trying to use it as a real flash IE Bouncing light etc, cause it's not a real flash. At all. The hot shoe (where the flash connects to the camera) is not the same universal hot shoe that every other camera in the world has been using since the dawn of photography because Nikon decided to only make an unusable awkward mini SB flash Available. Uber Low Quality! I am used to my Nikon D90, which is cheaper than the V1, and this thing is just plain crap in comparison. Don't call this a DSLR in a point-and-shoot body because it is not. The images are not even as detailed as my Sony Cybershot point and shoot. Where the extra $600 went into this thing I don't know. I own 2 different lenses for this V1 and I'm not a fan of the glass in them at all. At the end of the day, the better and larger the chip (that captures the image), the more you can zoom in on an image and see finer detail. It's not hard to see from these pics the camera takes poor quality images. From time to time however it will snap a still, crisp, detailed image. 1/10 shots on auto and since there are no options we are used to such as Shutter, Aperature Prefered, macro, etc that when zoomed in on, are grainy, poorly balanced and just plain dull. The worst part of this camera is the time it takes to take a picture. With the higher end Nikon's (WHICH YOU CAN OWN FOR THIS PRICE TAG!!) have a very fast response time from when you push the button to when the shutter opens and closes. In fact, most amateur photographers who are buying this camera are most likely looking for this feature and you will absolutley NOT find it in this camera. It's a millenia before the camera focuses and snaps the picture. What the heck was Nikon thinking? All in all I gave this camera such a poor one star rating because I feel that it does not operate any better than a well built $300 camera. It is definitely better than a cheapie Cannon/Kodak point and shoot walmart camera but no better than a higher end point and shoot you would buy at B&H; even with lens options. Furthermore, the extended cost to purchase the other lenses, flash, etc is just astronomical. For half the price yo0u can get into a small, lightweight Cannon Rebel or D series Nikon.

I absolutely appreciate the size and convenience that PNS cameras offer and currently own 9 PNS cameras, 5 35mm SLRs, 4 DSLRs and a Pentax 67. I am definitely NOT some snooty pro that shuns anything non-DSLR or non-pro nor am I some beginner with stars in my eyes or schmuck that doesn't know cameras or what he is talking about. I love my PNS cameras and am intimately familiar with them and came to own them after thorough comparison and experience. I rarely use my pro bodies and opt for my Nikon D5100 or Lumix TS3 nearly all the time.The Nikon 1 body is pretty solid and the lens does have a metal mount. My 1j1 with 10-30mm lens weighs 396.6g without strap and the GF3 weighs 435.7g without strap. My D5100 weighs 830.5g without strap and a Nikon P7100 weighs 395g, a Canon G12 weighs 355g and a Canon SX10 weighs 600g (P7100, G12 and SX10 weight is according to DPReview). The 10-30mm lens zooms rather smoothly for an inexpensive lens, about on par with a Nikon DX 18-55mm VR.The GF3's body is nice and solid but its lens feel is very disappointing. VERY plasticky with a plastic mount and zooming is jumpy particularly going from tele to wide. I can only hope that it will break in and smooth out but I've had modest success with cheap lenses improving over time. But it has a manual focus ring! :) Unfortunately you have to go into the Focus Menu and select Manual Focus before it does anything. :(Generally, the GF3's images tend to be a bit cool and underexposed and the Nikon 1's are a bit warm and overexposed. Contrast is better in the Nikon 1. I believe these issues could be corrected by dialing in some adjustments and then leaving them alone. The GF3's image has better to much better dynamic range than the Nikon 1's when flashing a modestly backlit subject. Dynamic range between the Nikon 1 and Lumix GF3 is similar in strong sunlight.At the pixel level the Nikon 1 is a bit sharper and more contrasty than the Lumix GF3 and textural detail and fine gradation render better on the Nikon 1 than on the Lumix GF3. It has been my experience, these are lens characteristics and likely should speak for the lenses involved (1 Nikkor 10-30mm and Lumix 14-42mm) rather than the sensors. The Nikon 1 also has better high ISO performance than the Lumix GF3, however it is still no match for a DSLR at high ISO. De-magnifying away from pixel level to \"fit screen\" magnifications of around 35%, sharpness and ISO noise are essentially indistinguishable.It is rather frustrating shooting these cameras in Auto Everything. I can't tell you how hard this is for me to not make constant adjustments. There is no camera in existence that actually does a good job ALL on its own. I'm trying to resist adjusting settings for the sake of this review but when I can't help it, the GF3 is WAY easier to navigate settings, customizations and adjustments. However, the GF3's Manual Exposure mode is terrible as you have to access a menu to change f-stop. What? MENU? It sucks when you have to press a button to switch from shutter to aperture, but to have to access a menu to switch between the two makes Manual Mode pretty much useless on the GF3 unless you are shooting landscapes or other stationary subjects with patience matching or exceeding yours. I don't like the Nikon 1's ergonomics for Manual Mode (or anything else), but at least aperture and shutter are both readily accessible with no menu or button presses.I had an outing in which I compared the 1j1, Lumix GF3, ZS7, TS3 and TS2. I put a tripod plate on each of them and just popped 'em all on and off the tripod and used Program or \"Standard Auto.\" I didn't use Nikon's Auto Scene Mode because it is hopelessly terrible and wasted space in any camera. Nor did I use Lumix's iA (Intelligent Auto) mode because it throws in a bunch of processing and also because it's pretty far from intelligent. Again, wasted space in cameras. It pains me that Lumix wasted a physical button on the GF3 for iA! That could have been a programmable Fn button. But no. It's a wasted button. At least you can program it so that it takes a long push to activate so you don't accidentally wind up in what amounts to \"Garbage Mode.\"The Nikon 1's collapsible lens gets downright frustrating in very little time. The release button must be pressed ALL the way in or release is sketchy or even scary. I have often thought \"OH, I've broken it this time!\" when I open the lens in a rush. I'm sure many of these lenses will fail because this poor lens lock is destined to break. I consider it a design flaw and Nikon really should do a recall or at the very least comp(limentary) the repair. Many shots are missed in the transition from collapsed to functional states. Leaving the lens in its functional state all the time is scary and it just feels like you're tempting fate by doing so.The Nikon 1's dramatic focus/focus tracking claims are exaggerated and Single Point Single Focus mode still returns the best focus results. It struggles to obtain focus and fails regularly in dim light or darkness even with its AF Assist Illuminator active. I was trying to photograph a friend who was lit by dim ambient street light and a single candle light at an outdoor bistro and the camera simply could not obtain focus. I had to focus on the candle (which was the same distance from the focal plane as her face) and then recompose the shot and then fire. This is a shot a DSLR would have had no trouble with and likely wouldn't have even needed its AF Assist Illuminator for. I also find that when I'm shooting my cats in front of a window screen that the Nikon 1 tends to focus on the screen instead. This is a common theme I am finding with the Nikon 1. It seems to look for linear patterns near the subject if the subject is not well-lit, contrasty or itself of linear pattern. Rather than do its best with your subject, it hunts for something easier to lock onto. A DSLR in Single Point or 3D Continuous Focus mode and not in Live View will track a subject and maintain focus better than a Nikon 1. I don't know if Nikon specifically claims otherwise, but that was my observation.The Nikon 1v1 is a paradox in which the requirement of an external flash would suggest it is targeted at serious photographers though its sole flash \"choice\" is severely underpowered for an external flash (exactly 2/3 as powerful as a Nikon D5100's internal POP-UP flash). Further perplexing is that neither Nikon 1 has exposure bracketing. The camera's ergonomics leaves WORLDS to be desired by even hobbyists, let alone serious to expert photographers.If you know much about the 1j1 already, let me clear up one of the elephants in the living room; YES, its popped-up flash IS as flimsy and scary-looking as it appears in pictures. It is seriously so bad that I'm scared to use it because one has to baby it pushing its OFF-CENTER mass back into the camera. Make sure you push it down from the left/port side (as seen from rear of camera). If you just nonchalantly pop it back down the way you normally would some other pop-up flash, you realistically could break it off.While we're on the topic of flash, the Lumix GF3 flash's bottom segment can be pulled back (halfway closed) so you can bounce off the ceiling. Kinda neat! Would be really nice if it could hold this position on its own. Your subject will need to be near and/or ISO high to bounce with the internal flash, but it's possible and the results are as would be expected from a bounce. Nice GF1, GF2, GF3 and GX1 perk.The Nikon 1 is a camera that requires just as much attention and adjustment as any other camera to get properly exposed, properly-focused images but it takes more effort to pay that attention and make those adjustments. It has the second-worst ergonomics I've ever used in any camera regardless of price and venturing out of \"auto everything all the time\" takes too long and is too laborious and often frustrating, particularly with \"fleeting moment\" photos. If your cat is on his back and super-cute, but you KNOW he's about to roll over, forget it. Just pop the flash (on a 1j1) if necessary, press the button and deal with it in Photoshop. You'll miss the shot if you try to install the flash on a 1v1 and/or change Exposure Mode and/or D-Lighting and/or Focus Mode and/or Picture Control and/or any such item. Making 1 or 2 settings changes on a DSLR can be nearly instantaneous or done within a couple seconds. The same adjustments on a Nikon 1 could take as much as 15-30 seconds. Eons in relative terms and the difference between getting the shot and missing the shot.Frankly, the Nikon 1, particularly the 1v1, is an oversized and vastly overpriced PNS camera whose great parts should be put into a serious compact camera like the Nikon P7100, hence creating the Nikon C7000 instead of being wasted on a fashion camera that doesn't even have any form of grip whatsoever. Its images are very slightly better than a Lumix TS3's and ZS7's, goes back and forth vs. a Lumix GF3 and is NOWHERE near as good as a Nikon D5100's. For anyone in the real world (\"real world\" = \"fill screen\" which is roughly 25%-35% monitor magnification, paper prints 12\"x18\" and smaller, canvas giclee prints 20\"x30\" and smaller) not literally making really big prints and/or substantial crops on a very regular basis, PNS cameras will yield equally good results. And if you ARE making really big prints and/or substantial crops on a very regular basis, don't kid yourself, a DSLR is DEFINITELY something you should step up to as people this serious about photography will be exponentially better-served with a real camera with dramatically better image quality and real lens and lighting choices.If one MUST get one of these mid-sized sensor mirrorless cameras, I'd suggest the Lumix GX1 as the hands-down mid-sized sensor ergonomics winners (by a huge margin!) with \"as good as but different\" image quality as a Nikon 1 or I'd suggest the Lumix GF2 and slightly less the GF3 for relatively exceptionally good ergonomics and \"as good as but different\" image quality as a Nikon 1. Or, based on reviews and NOT my own experience, the Olympus PEN line or Fuji X10. I would recommend against the Sony NEX as it is the only camera I have ever used with worse ergonomics than the Nikon 1. However, the NEX-5n's sensor is worlds better than the Nikon 1's. Particularly intriguing to me is the upcoming Canon G1X (This is NOT a typo. Lumix has the GX1 and Canon has the G1X) with its larger-than-4/3 sensor and fixed 28-112 equivalent f/2.8-5.8 lens.I would still recommend against this type of camera for ANYONE. These cameras barely if at all deliver on the promise of more portability than a DSLR and the Nikon 1's claim of DSLR-caliber images is a blatant lie and falls WAY short of such a lofty statement. Their images are LITERALLY virtually indistinguishable in the real world from any quality PNS camera. And their ergonomics are essentially identical to the average PNS. In the case of the Nikon 1 and Sony NEX, ergonomics are WORSE than the average PNS.I really wanted the Nikon 1 to be \"the photographer's camera when going light.\" It is truly extremely far away from that! If you're a Leicaphile looking for a cool toy, you're gonna be REAL disappointed with the Nikon 1.Nikon threw a fishing lure out there to appeal to iPhone users/fashionistas who are more gadget-fashion-conscious and menu-driven and PNS shooters BY FAR than to real photographers or those who genuinely are concerned with GETTING the shot or image quality. Even iPhone users/fashionistas balked at the ridiculous price for a toy camera that is actually available, I kid you not, in pink. Hence, the immediately-slashed prices.If you need portability, get a pocketable PNS like a Lumix TS3 or Nikon AW100, both waterproof and shockproof with non-extending lenses. Or for non-tough cameras with extending lenses; a Lumix ZS7 or ZS10 or Nikon S8200 or S9100 or Canon S95 or S100.I just got a Canon S100 and I have to tell you, it's been a little while since I've had such a \"WOW\" experience in cameras. I HIGHLY suggest you check one out. Reviews out there are mixed on it but I don't care about the reviews. I have one (and its predecessor the S95) and I've been shooting it. It produces MUCH better image quality than the already very good S95. The S100's image feel is similar to the Nikon 1's in that it is very saturated and rich. I call this \"juicy.\" Its dynamic range is fantastic and the S100 has easily and instantly positioned itself as my favorite PNS camera to date and I plan on selling off most of my PNS cameras now. All I need for non-DSLR cameras now are my Canon S100 and Lumix TS3. In all honesty, the S100's image feel is arguably my favorite of ANY camera. Yes, including my DSLRs. Now, I'm not saying that at the pixel level the S100 can hold up vs. DSLRs for grain/noise, edge detail or other pedantic idiosyncrasies that will never matter in a shot not being turned into a billboard. It can't. But for real life prints (16x20 and maybe larger) and easily fill-screen magnifications, it is a very lush looking image that I find EXTREMELY satisfying.I would take a Canon S100 over a Nikon 1 any day. I like its image feel more, its ergonomics are WORLDS better and it is a VERY small and light camera that can EASILY fit in my jeans front pocket and it has a 24-120mm F2.0-5.9 lens that is super colorful, contrasty and quite sharp, though 24mm has lots of distortion.Visit Amazon's Canon S100 page and view the customer images.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B005MTME3U/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_allTons of beautiful juicy images. And easily-shot too. Check the Nikon 1 J1's page on Amazon.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B005OGQXJW/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_allThere are only 2 images; 1 of a customer's J1 captioned that it can't take a picture of itself and one of a warehouse ceiling stating the camera has trouble focusing. Amazon's V1 page has not a single customer image...I'm calling it right here, right now. The Canon S100 is THE smaller-than-DSLR camera to own. Period. And compared to a Nikon 1, it's dirt cheap. That's my take. Now if only they would paint the S100 in Nikon 1 J1 candy red... :)If you want a rangefinder camera that's substantially more portable than a DSLR and pocketable in loose pockets (i.e. slacks, but not jeans) or a modest purse, get a Nikon P7100 or Canon G12. Both the P7100 and G12 are lighter, more compact, have faster lenses with more to dramatically more zoom range, built-in flash and VASTLY (I cannot stress this enough; VASTLY) superior ergonomics.The Nikon 1, despite the potential of its good sensor, fast and good image processing and superb Live View simply can't materialize its potential into a camera that consistently captures exceptional images because of truly egregiously flawed physical ergonomic and menu design that so completely gets in the way of making necessary adjustments that many pictures simply are missed. Its poor focusing in anything other than bright light costs further shots still and at night it is almost completely unusable even in Single Point Single Focus with AF Assist Illuminator active. It is either a camera that must be relegated to situations where time can be spent to set up a shot (like in a studio or with patient subjects/landscapes) or as an auto everything all the time camera. There are tons of better cameras for the former situation at the same price or less and it is not very good in the latter situation and is no better than cameras that cost a fraction of its price there.I'm sure there will be those who love the Nikon 1 and I'm happy for everyone who finds something they love. But I don't love the Nikon 1. I don't even like it. To me, it really isn't worth owning at any price. Even if I was given one for free, I would never use it.I am rating this camera only 2 stars because of its price. There is no escaping the fact that it is a very oversized PNS camera with slow to very slow lens(es) and very limited zoom range except for its really slow $750 10-100mm f/4.5-5.6 video lens. As such, it should cost no more than $300-$350. Given its terrible ergonomics, it shouldn't cost more than $300. At $300, I would give it 3 stars simply because given the right circumstances it CAN produce very nice images. Its ergonomics keep it from ever earning more than 3 stars even if was given away for free. No matter what, it is a camera I would never choose to use and actually dreaded using it while doing this review because I wanted to take pictures... and not wrestle with menus and calculate how the camera would respond to certain situations and what settings that would require to get the shot, in which time the shot had vanished.I have since returned the Nikon 1 and the only thing I miss is the gorgeous red paint.

The shutter speed goes down too slow and the resulting blurred images of performers are useless.I bought the Nikon1 V1 because it offers full Pro Camera like exposures setting for Manual, AP, SP and Auto - perfect for shooting in darkened concert venues, which it does very well. An added bonus I like is the view finder, which when your eye or finger is placed up next to it, it turns off the big, bright, power robbing digital display screen on the back of the camera - while you can easily focus on your subject and see the exposed image in the eyepiece viewfinder's digital display. Nothing is more annoying in a dark concert or club venue when all the Amateurs and Pro Photogs holding up their cell phone cameras and pro cameras in front of you, in your line of vision with the lighted screens shining back in your face. It ruins the entire concert experience.The new  Nikon 1 V1 with view finder is a nice start, but for me it falls short in many areas:* Compared to the smaller and 3 year older Coolpix with14.2 Mp, the N1 with just 10 Mp screen is too friggin' small to shoot decent print work. It should have a 20 Mp Screen at least for where the market is at now, or at least equal the older/cheaper Coolpix's 14.1  Mp screen.* The maximum ISO setting of 3200 is just low. It should have ISO 6400 like Pro cameras for shooting in low light.* The rear display screen can not be turned off during shooting, while you just use the eye piece. You have to consciously keep your thumb over the eye piece to keep the screen turned off to not annoy people around you, and not attract the attention of security guards at club concerts.* With the N1's 10-30 zoom lens installed, the N1 camera is still too bulky to fit and carry in a normal pocket. I need to take the lens off the body to fit it into 2 pockets for entry into concerts. While I still need to revert back to the my smaller bodied Coolpix for motorcycle trips when I can slip it easily in a zippered jacket pocket for quick roadside shots.* And the N1's len's 10-30 zoom range is much too short - it needs to be more 10-50 or 70 for practical distance and club concert use.I was so close to retuning this N1 Nikon back to Amazon because it falls so short, for me, in so many areas. Hopefully the next generation of N1 will correct these shortcomings.You might be much happier with a Coolpix if you want an automatic only camera with built-in flash: Nikon COOLPIX S6300 16 MP Digital Camera with 10x Zoom NIKKOR Glass Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Silver)", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "TOO SOON", "Author": "Orpheus", "ReviewID": "R24ITTX01I0QKO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A camera takes more than a week or two to evaluate.

I switched to digital years ago ...way ahead of the curve...with a Sony Mavica that was 640 x 480 max and stored on floppies.  The stone age I know but just wanted to let you know I was an eager \"early adapter\" of digital imaging.But am I tired of autofocus!  After a succession of point and shoot I got a Nikon D5100.  It does too much and is not intuitive at least for me.  I don't want to make videos with a still camera!  I want a smaller camera.  The 5100 is OK but way too big and heavy.  Thought I'd go with Olympus 4/3 system but some things about it made me hesitant.  The only good thing about the 5100 is that I can finally focus manually!So, hearing about the N1 I was excited.  I thought Nikon had finally gotten the word that these bigger and bigger digital slrs were becoming ridiculous.  What is the limit Nikon and other manufacturers?I have learned much to my disappointment that the N1 is really a point and shoot camera.  I mean....why have detachable lenses if you cannot manually focus?  That is the deal breaker for me.....it's an autofocus camera plain and simple....no different than all the rest with a pseudo...fake through the lens style viewfinder.....a real disappointment for me.And....the thing costs more than a 5100.  No thanks Nikon.  I'm going back to look at Olympus in search of smaller and lighter....especially with lenses they seem to have followed their own advice in the past that a smaller slr is a better slr.I'm waiting to see the next generation of Nikon slrs...maybe they will be the size of old glass plate cameras....12 or 15 pounds and require a pull cart to transport and a tripod to use?  100,000 mp and weigh 25 pounds ...where's the limit Nikon?  How big do your gigantic slrs have to become before people wise up.  So many younger buyers are clueless that , in the past , film slrs were available that were much smaller and lighter.What I want is a MANUAL focus digital slr.NO autofocus and cut out most of the menu junk....  This would remove all the weight of the autofocus etc.  Also, I don't need the video capability either...it's a still camera dummies....video cameras are TINY.End of rant.....I really really really want a nice small manual focus digital slr and sadly the N1 isn't it.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "So dissapointed", "Author": "pashee", "ReviewID": "R20FXGYSVL3RZY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i just got my v1........  the few pics i've taken are incredibly disappointing.  i also can't believe this thing doesn't have a built in flash!!  i exchanged the j1 for the v1 because i wanted an external audio port, so i didn't even think to check if the j1 has a flash before i got it.i can't even believe it!!  who cares about the dumb view finder?!  i want a built in flash!!!i'm returning it.  i guess i bought the hype, and now i'm sad.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sorry Nikon..you can't make it this time.", "Author": "ATK \"ATK\"", "ReviewID": "RY712Q0S4WXZ7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Warning !!

How come V1 and J1 are more expensive than NEX, GF and PEN? Recently J1 and V1 exhibit the higher image quality than GF and PEN. However, please keep in mind that They didn't update their sensors for almost 2 years.I am a Nikon fan since I began taking pictures 10 year ago. I am own D300+grip, 14-24mm, 24-70mm, 70-200 VRII and etc. You can imagine how heavy all these equipment combined and hiking up hill 10 hr for a great shoot.I am confusing to select V1 or J1 over other mirrorless cameras. It seems like only good thing is that it is \"Nikon\" brand.Is it Fun camera ? Maybe yes. (not for me)If you're very big fan of compact camera, and do not want complicated setting.Nikon 1 is like a stupid compact camera with a bigger sensor. They have No auto HDR, No digital filter, and No Panorama mode. Basically they can take nice clear and beautiful pictures and video.  It was almost two years late, but Nikon just begins with very basic functions.I am thinking that Nikon might add these features later in next model.Whyyyy.Controlling this camera is so basic and simple, but painful. There is no focusing ring, but you can manually focus from menu T-T. Full Auto mode is not good enough. I would not be surprised if one will complain about this unreliable auto mode. Please check other reviews from real users.The only cameras in the history of Nikon are The D1, D2 and D3 series have no flash. But now V1 has no flash !!!. why ??Every mirrorless cameras on the market at least have an internal flash or supplied external flash in the box.They can use AF-S or AF Nikor lens. It is very good idea, but not really practical. Since 2.7x crop factor, most of all lenses will become tele- and super tele photo lenses. The question is why I has to carry my lens + adapter + V1 for every day use.
