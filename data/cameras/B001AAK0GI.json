{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worst Product Ever Purchased", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1757SQEAOWCA3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The hardest part of this review will be keeping it short when so many things are wrong with this product. I purchased a camera, a gateway, a wall plug module, and a motion detector.  It was a 4 evening of fighting with the setup to get everything partially working. Then after two days everything quit working. I have to completely reconfigure all products. Then once again after a couple of days, I had the same problem. I spent more time reconfiguring only to have it happen a third time. Camera could not be found, the motion detector did not work and the web based software could not see the gateway.During the time that the system was working, it was only partially working. Features like the motion detection of the camera and actions by the web based software was supposed to send me Email if an event was triggered. That never happened. Tech support was useless. Night time tech support takes you to a 3rd party tech support that can solve no problems and tells you that you have to call during the day.  I call daytime and asked a simple question about what a field in the camera setup called \"Split By\" was supposed to do and they could not answer that and told me to send in email. And as you might guess my email was never answered. The only other answer I got from daytime tech was the server was having software problem wait until Monday. Well it did start working on Monday for 2 days.So here are my complaints:Bad Tech Support,Server Software has problems,Documentation is too brief.All product that I purchased were unreliable,Once configured, things will quit working and when you try to correct everything quits working.Not all features would work at anytime.I have quit, I am no longer trying to make these product work.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hawking Homeremote Pro and Camera HRPC2 a mistake to buy", "Author": "Joachim E. Zinke", "ReviewID": "R1QPCK3FXFEYTS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hawking HomeRemote Pro HRPC2 Wireless Video Camera with Night VisionHawking HRPG1 HomeRemote Pro Control and Remote Monitoring Internet Gateway (White)I bought the Hawking Homeremote Pro kit and a Hawking Homeremote Pro Camera with Nightvision (HRPC2) as a starter Kit for my first home automation project. What a dissapointment! What was supposed to be the ultimate Home automation solution turned out to be a nightmare. The software for the Homeremote Pro is forcing you to make a 10$ a month subscrption to a useless Web-service with a not responding email hotline and phone hotline so terrible you voluntarily hang up by yourself. The camera picture doesn't show on the web-site and the settings to activate the camera via internet by yourself are blocked to force you using the web-service (which doesn't work). Same with the Homeremote Pro Controler. Again the biggest dissapointment I had in software and hardware since years. I trapped into these products by looking for Z-wave Modules and my recommendation for the Z-wave community is banning Hawking products from there sites.", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Home Remote Pro HRPC2 camera w/ night vision and gateway", "Author": "E. Leslie Combs", "ReviewID": "R20Y8LQIE001HV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It took me forever to get the Home Remote Pro Gateway to work. The online manual (which I printed out) was anything but clear. I had been using my GE handheld remotes on my z-wave system without problem. Converting it over to the home remote Pro Gateway proved to be a nightmare. I tried to contact their tech support on several occasions. I called the tech support, number at least 15 times and made contact with Cal, apparently their only tech support person two times. Almost every time I called, I received a message about how busy tech support was and that I was number one in the queue, but still had to hold at least 15 minutes. Then, it became apparent that I could get no real answers, either because Cal wanted nothing to do with helping me or because he did not know anything about the product.I finally got the Gateway working, but I had to do with a 50 foot ethernet cable and extension cord. Believe it or not there is no dongle, and the Gateway has to be within 3 feet of a switch.I've been trying to configure the camera, but again there is no help or information available. When I click on the installation disk at \"View the Online Manual\", I received the message \"the page cannot be found.\"I would not buy any product from this company again.", "Date": "August 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "TanLoan 2010", "ReviewID": "R3T31AXPNWG1IS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this on sale for 54.00 plus and now regretting that I didn't buy more. The camera is excellent with night vision and audio support. Morever, you can connect a hard drive to it to record everything. Sure somebody having problem to configurate the camera. But once you know how to make it works, it is a wonderful camera and much cheaper than some other brand with the same features.
