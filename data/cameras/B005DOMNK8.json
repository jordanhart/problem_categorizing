Both arrived quickly in good shape.  Really liked the quality of the camera construction - solid, tightly sealed.  What I didn't know before purchasing was 1) a 120VAC/DC power adapter was included (i.e. don't necessiarly have to use POE) and 2) that there is a single cable out of the back of the camera about 2-3' long that expands into 3 things at the end: an ethernet plug, a power adapter plug, and a little button for camera reset (none of these are weatherproof).  If you don't have a sheltered place 2-3 feet from camera, then the power/ ethernet cable connections will be exposed to the elements (although you could probably tape/ seal the connections).  I wanted to first check out and verify operation of the camera before going to all the trouble to set it up/ route cables outside (good thing).  So I installed the included software (\"IP Camera Tool\" on Windows Vista PC (dedicated to Blue Iris/ monitoring of 6 other older TrendNet cameras), connected the new Agasio camera to its power adapter and the ethernet to a non-POE switch.  Software found the Agasio camera right away, had it working in no time - for simplicity I then only changed the camera to a fixed IP address, then added camera in Blue Iris, no problem, worked right away.  Unplugged camera from power adapter and ethernet, powered up TP-Link POE Switch, plugged camera into one of the four POE ports (plus connected non-POE port into my other switch), Agasio camera powered up right away and continued to operate fine in Blue Iris.  Left it to operate awhile to 'burn in'.  After about half an hour everything died.  POE switch lights flashed indicating power overload on that port (only the camera was connected, no other POE devices).  Disconnected/ reconnected POE ethernet to camera, same problem repeated, camera unresponsive.  Completly disconnected camera from POE switch, restored connections as in 1st test (power from adapter, non-POE ethernet).  Camera didn't respond.  Did factory reset, included software (\"IP Camera Tool\") couldn't find camera.  Repeated a few times, same thing.  Powered off 24 hrs, camera never came back.

For setup, I just plugged it into a PoE enabled jack it blinked and connected to my network. From my router I saw what IP the DHCP assigned. Typed that into Firefox and the camera popped up. I setup a static IP and changed some of the brightness/contrast settings. Settings take about 30s to change except the immediate video effects like brightness/contrast/flipped/inverted.Once installed, they work well. In the daylight, they are relatively accurate in their colours, and their view angle is not wide, but wide enough. The resolution is only 640x480 and over a gigabit connection to a high end i7 server, they average 10-15 FPS at \"very high\" JPEG quality running through 60 meters of RJ45 cable, and 2 switches. At night, the included IR LEDs are almost useless. If they have something to reflect on, you can sort of make it out, otherwise it is pretty dark. This means insects and things set it off easily if you have motion detection, but it is also sensitive enough that if someone/something does pass infront of it, it will trip the record. You will at least have a record of the event, just not really enough detail to do anything about it.I currently have 3 of these cameras installed outside, and have had them installed for a few weeks now. Over these few weeks they have all worked continuously and perfectly except for 1 camera had 1 occasion it flickered out for a good 30 minutes. It was during a rainstorm and afterwards I noticed the RJ45 connection on the camera was drooping lower than my roofline. My guess is that it got wet. After it dried, it turned back on, retained all settings, and has continued like a champ.I just purchased 4 more of these because they make great wide coverage cameras. Cheap enough that they let you know what's going on everywhere. I have also ordered a true 1080p PoE camera to replace one of these on the main access point to the house. The high definition cameras will capture the detail you need, these little cheap cameras will let you know grossly what happened and to start recording from the good cameras!For less than $90 these are great value for money. If you want HD cameras, you are looking at twice that at least for anything of reasonable quality. Make your choice to have 1 good camera or 2 OK cameras if on a budget. My choice was many OK cameras and a very select few excellent cameras.My expectations for this camera were very low, and gladly it surpassed them and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. I do feel that the connectors on the pigtail will be the downfall of these cameras. They are not waterproof or even weatherproof. There is no easy way to secure them, and the RJ45 jack which in power over ethernet cases supplies both power and data is extremely exposed. I am currently thinking of putting the connectors and wiring through a sealed outdoor rated PVC electrical junction box. Get the small ones for a few dollars at a home improvement store, they are gray, and they can be mounted near the camera and shove the wires inside.

The biggest problem for me is the low resolution but this has been typical of all these type of cameras.  Having said that they are very useful and provide the security I was wanting which is sending email when triggered by movement.  This can be done even with the computer off; just plug it into the wireless router and setup you email account.

It's heavy and metal and really feels like it can take years of abuse inside or out.  I originally bought it because it was PoE, but the fact that it also is WiFi has made me reconsider and just put it to AC power.  It's got great distance on the WiFi, picking up the signal in all corners of my house, where even my portable devices sometimes suffer.  It's got a large WiFi antennae that connects to it for this purpose.  And its night vision works incredibly well.  I love the fact that it can be set up to email you when motion is detected.  So even if you don't have a DVR, you can still have hard proof of intruders.  Setting it up to be viewed from my phone remotely was also a breeze.  When I am ready to expand, I will get another one of these.The bad:There's nothing really bad, per se.  My only complaint is that its field of view doesn't seem to be as wide as it could be.  Also, some of the emailed pictures have motion blur, so you might only get one or two good ones out of the half dozen or so it will send you.  Also, the wifi antenna and the power cord sometimes fight for space.
