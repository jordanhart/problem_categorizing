{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I know I love it.", "Author": "2ParrotMom", "ReviewID": "R4WB67117492B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the Canon EOS Rebel T3 12.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm IS II Lens + Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens back in September. Its my first DSLR. I have used Sony since 2005 and have been using the Sony H-5 and the Sony HX100v. I have to say it was a learning curve switching over to the Canon but a short one as I got David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography book. This truly helped me a lot with the T3.My only recommendation would be to get the package with the 55-250mm tele lens that has IS ( image stabilization) on it. My 75-300mm that came with the package I ordered did not have image stabilization so much of the time I have to use my tripod for distance shots. The 18-55mm lens did come with \"IS\" so that was a plus, I only wish I would have really looked over what I was getting before making my decision. The cost difference is minimal. Now I am saving up to get a 55-250mm IS lens.And think about getting an AC adaptor, this comes in handy when you don't want to run your batteries down.But I will say, I adore the battery life, talk about long life. And the view finder, its outstanding on this camera. On my Sony HX100, it was awful. There are times when you need to use the VF vs the live view screen. Especially when you are in sunny condition, this VF on the Canon is tops.I think for the beginner to the world of DSLR you cant go wrong. I know of some photographers who have this T3 body and have upgraded their lens to much nicer than the kit lens. They say the T3 body is perfect. I am still learning, but from what I have been doing, I love it.  I have been shooting some close up shots of bugs, bees, lichen, moss and tiny 1/4\" in diameter orange pinwheel mushrooms with the 18-55mm and getting some amazing shots. Loads of detail.I am very pleased with this camera.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Feature-laden; offers as little or as much automation as you like...", "Author": "35-year Technology Consumer \"8-tracks to 802.11\"", "ReviewID": "R3RAC9QHGPFQEN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you need an entry-level DSLR that is feature-laden and will return you to complete control of your photography, this kit is a good choice. The two included Canon lenses will take you from focal lengths of 18 to 300 mm. The camera will capture still images (.jpg, RAW) and HD video (.mov at 1280x720 resolution).My first SLR was a completely manual Canon FTb, purchased from a friend when Jimmy Carter was president and we placed our images on film. If you were a strong amateur photographer, you might enjoy some feedback in a couple hours IF you processed your own black and white film. Otherwise, you waited, hoped for the best, and prepared for the fact of life that most of your prints would not be keepers...Fast forward to the delight of digital photography in the early 21st century, when the first cameras in the hands of consumers set you back about as much as this model..for around 2 MB resolution. While the instant gratification --and endless opportunity to experiment with images on solid state media-- of digital photography was a great change, the loss of control (from a lack of through-the-lens (TTL) viewing, no ability to set aperture and shutter speed manually and the constraint of a fixed lens) was bound to frustrate former SLR shooters.I've been doing SLR photography for over 30 years, digital photography for over 10 years. I added \"D\" to my SLR photography with two different Pentax cameras in the last 7 years. One had persistent issues with flash performance (even after two warranty repairs), and a more recent model simply stopped working after 17 months...only to revive when it arrived at the repair center (an event which cost $100 to find out about). So, Pentax was off my candidate list for replacements.I looked at available options than included multiple lenses and an HD video capability, and eventually narrowed it down to this kit.Pros:-Excellent price for a two lens kit and HD recording capability.-Great range of control and automation features. From full auto to completely manual, you can exercise as much (or as little) control as you like over the process.-Options for both TTL and LCD viewfinder viewing of your photo subjects.-Lightweight body-Good printed users manual and excellent .pdf manual with more detailsCons:-No memory card in the box. Hope you remembered one or have one around.-Only power option is a Canon proprietary form factor battery and AC charger. You can't charge via USB or operate via standard batteries. You'll want to consider adding an extra to your bag.-Minor issues with one of included utility programs (\"Digital Photo Professional\"). This can freeze (on a Windows machine) when navigating to a folder that contains images *not* produced with a Canon camera. Sounds strange...but it's true.Overall, I've been very impressed with this camera's ability to autofocus and its response to tricky lighting situations. If I can get more than 17 months out of it, it will be a better performer than the Pentax it replaced!", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid entry-level DSLR", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R380END2OT3ZAC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good bang for the buck kit.

I really enjoy the info screens that come up with each different mode.  It has made my taking pictures at horse shows easier.  My previous camera was stolen a couple of months ago and I had always struggled getting the right setting with the right lighting with indoor arenas and covered arenas with backlighting.  The camera gave me information that I used to experiment until I found the right settings to stop the action of the horses jumping over fences without all of the blurring motion.  I even switched to the video mode and shot their courses with the video.  My down side was getting the focus just right in the video mode.  I had 2 videos that came out and 1 that I stuggled with the focus.  All of the kids that I was with enjoyed the pics and video to study their performances.  Another thing that I liked about the camera is the weight.  This camera and lens is much lighter than my previous camera.  I started using the autofocus more on this camera than I had on my previous due to the quickness of the focusing.  I was able to go from each jump to the next and get the camera to focus quickly.  Someone else at our barn had received a different Canon EOS (not the T3) and she didn't know which settings to use to achieve the same photos that I was getting.  I was able to help her set up her camera so that she was able to get the same quality as I was getting.The quick screens help, especially for those of us that don't have the patience to \"read the manual.\"  I want to take the camera and experiment with it until I get the desired results.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very good starter DLSR package", "Author": "Joanna Daneman", "ReviewID": "R270Z4N7M4GHJJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Good:The T3i Rebel is a very popular camera, with good reason, It does a lot--almost everything you'd need in a DSLR, including video. There are two newer models, a T4i (which had issues with the coating and was discontinued) and the T5i, which has a touchscreen, some added features and a stereo mic for the video.The new rotating screen in the T3i and up--a very good feature. The main difference to the new T5i is that it is NOT a touchscreen. The new screen is also a lot larger and flips around. This makes video shooting a lot easier and it's much nicer to tuck it away when your camera is put in the bag.You also get the the ability to control wireless flash.The new Creative Filters are added after you take your picture and can add the effect of a toy (Lomo) camera, fisheye and grainy black and white. They are fun. I got some great effects with these.The \"A\" setting (automatic) now is \"A+\" and has \"Intelligent Scene Analysis\" and figures out, based on what you are photographing, color balance and other tweaks.The Video lets you do HD video shooting, including \"Video Snapshot\" (short clips 2, 4 or 8 second)This is a nice lens package; the 18-55mm IS is a good standard lens. The 75-300mm is a decent telephoto (I got some great bird shots) but it isn't IS (internally stabilized) and it isn't USM either.The Bad:The included 75-300mm lens is not very fast and you will need a tripod to use it most of the time--no IS (internal stabilization.) I find it is not as sharp, even on a tripod as the shorter 55-250mm lens. Doing night photography, I could see some chromatic aberration at 300mm.Bottom line: at the four-hundred something price point for 2 lenses and body, a real deal and heartily recommended for a first DSLR.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "You CAN love a digital as much as your beloved 35-mm!!!", "Author": "M.

I did some semi-professional photography years back with a Canon AE-1 (35-mm) and it was an awesome camera.  I have avoided digital photography for years simply because I was so afraid I would be very disappointed.  The last batch of 35-mm films I had developed were, tragically, pitiful. The colors were all wrong. When I finally saw the Rebel T3 I felt like maybe it might be the camera that brought me successfully into the world of digital photography -- and it did with flying colors.  No more trips in the middle of the night to have film quickly processed.  Life has been good!  I am finding a lots of settings the camera can do that I have no idea what they will end up shooting .... but all is well in the end and the happy suprises of having photographs that I didn't realize I could do.  It is great and I would fully recommend it to anyone who wants a full usage camera where you, yourself, are the \"star\".  I am 66 years old.  It takes a bit to impress me.  This little camera certainly did and them some.  I am a very happy photo shooter once again.  Thanks, Canon, for remembering how great the old cameras were when we opened them for the first time (and every time afterwards) --- and thank you for recreating the same memorable experience with the new cameras.  I'm as excited as I was at getting my first camera at age 20 and I know this one will be even better as time goes on and I find out just what all of those buttons actually mean.!!!

Without the cost of film, it really makes sense to take as many pictures as possible.Only a very few things I think could be better.
