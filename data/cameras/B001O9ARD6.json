{"Reviews": [{"Title": "terrific camera that's easy to use", "Author": "Matthew G. Sherwin", "ReviewID": "R3PSX50X3O2TJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When they say \"this one's got it all,\" they mean it! This is certainly an upgrade to what I had before; and there's more features to this that I imaged there ever could be. It's built to last quite some while and it doesn't stint on options. Fortunately, however, I was able to learn how to use it rather quickly; and even the manual is well written! Most manuals are no fun to read but this one is written quite well in plain English and that's terrific. It also comes with a CD-ROM that lets you install the necessary computer software to connect the computer to the camera; the software also lets you register the camera with Sony and copy an extra instruction manual onto your hard drive. Moreover, this camera takes clear images every time and of course that built in flash works wonders. The buttons and dials are easy to manipulate and press; although you do have to be careful to press them using the edge of your finger (or your fingernail) because a few of the buttons are small.The camera comes on \"auto\" for those of us who don't want to fiddle too much before taking pictures--but of course there's so much more to this camera than just the \"auto\" mode. Use the mode dial to access modes for taking pictures on the beach so that the blueness of the water looks as blue as can be, taking pictures when it's snowy to make the snow look a bit extra white, take a picture when the camera detects that someone is smiling, and much more! The control button and one or two other buttons help you to get the flash working under more than one setting, view and delete pictures and again, much more. You can easily attach this camera to your computer so that you can upload photos to your hard drive for storage there--or for posting your pictures to a website which can be incredibly useful and fun. In addition, to preserve the life of the battery pack between charges the camera shuts itself off after roughly three minutes of non-usage; this is a very good feature. I'm impressed.The camera is capable of taking video clips although I don't think that it is designed primarily for that purpose. However, it will let you record video; the camera has a built in speaker, microphone and a \"movie mode\" to do this well.In addition, you'll need to charge the battery pack for about four and one-half hours prior to shooting any pictures so don't wait until the moment you need this to open it up and use it. The memory stick will be ready to go, fortunately. I purchased an eight gigabyte memory stick so that I'll have plenty of space for storing my photos and movies. Be sure to get the memory stick and not the memory card; a memory card may not fit in the slot. At roughly twelve megapixels an eight gigabyte memory stick will hold about sixteen hundred photos.There is also an internal rechargeable battery that may need to be charged if you don't use the camera for over a month. In case this occurs, make sure your battery pack is fully charged and then insert it so that the battery pack charges the internal battery for twenty-four hours or a little bit longer--while the camera is turned off. That should solve the problem. Sony also has ways for you to contact them in case you have further questions about the camera and how to keep this working for a long time to come!Overall, I really like this camera; and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice Sleek, Lightweight Camera!", "Author": "Tammy Erwin", "ReviewID": "R2AZGYHFXCCULN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is so small and lightweight, it will fit into a pocket in a pair of jeans, or even a pocket that is on the front of a T-Shirt.  When we received this camera I was so impressed at how light the item was and the magnificant pictures it takes.  It powers on very quickly to help to not miss that special picture that you might miss with other cameras because they take so long to power on.  The camera is sleek, portable, and takes awesome pictures.  It has many of features that we have not yet been able to try out.  I think if you are looking for a small, sleek, camera to take to a baseball game, or something of that nature to keep from having to drag a big huge SLR camera or bigger digital camera, this camera will do the job perfectly! I highly recommend this camera to anyone that is looking for a lightweight, nice picture taking camera!!!", "Date": "May 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Jose.

Lately it seemed like I was getting more fuzzy shots than clear ones.  Time to upgrade the camera.  This was a great price, and Sony is a great brand.  It hasn't disappointed me.  I'm now able to get all of those action pictures of the kids in clear detail.  And the screen is much larger than my other Sony.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Easy to use", "Author": "Grace in Kansas", "ReviewID": "R26709HMGJN49K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Neither my husband nor I have much experience with cameras, but took this one on our European vacation and had such fun taking pictures.  It's very easy to use, requires no focusing, and was easy to tote around.

Higgins", "ReviewID": "RMHWBMIC3WETL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a pretty nice camera for casual snaps and travel photos.  I like the portability, the image stabilization, and the lens is pretty sharp; I like the fairly good wide angle coverage.  The cons are few, but are important to me.  First off, the flash is just about worthless.  It is either off or ****FLASH****.  You can turn it down in the menus, but it is still overpowering when you use it.  Perhaps my camera is defective.  Secondly, the battery life could be better. It isn't horrible, but you pay for the petite battery size with fewer shots.  Try to avoid reviewing all your photos while you're out shooting, the backlight in the LCD takes it's toll.  The battery also takes quite a while to charge.  Not wild about using Memory stick rather than SD, but it is a Sony so it is to be expected.  Lastly, even at ISO 100 there is chroma noise in the shadows, but this can be tweaked in post-processing.  I suspect this is due to it being a 12 MP camera with a relatively small sensor.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "K. Erickson", "ReviewID": "R32RB1XN22TPM3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera about a month ago since my previous Sony Cybershot broke.  When I purchased that camera in 2005 it was over $300. I was pleased to see that the pricing had come down significantly ($159.99) and the mega pixels had increased (12.1 as oppossed to 7.2).  The camera is extremely lightweight, easy to use and takes beautiful pictures. My FAVORITE feature, however, is the different color shooting options.  You can shoot in black and white, sepia tone, vivid color and regular color.  I stumbled upon this feature by accident and I was so happy I did!  It gives you professional looking pictures with minimal effort.  I also like the smile feature where the camera detects when someone smiles and fires off a shot without your hitting the shutter button.All in all, a lot of camera for a little money!  I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone!", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Michael D.

What i love is that the screen tells you what each setting does as you change the dial.  Idiot proof.  I also love that you can take photos in a streeming shot - most of the ones we have tried are always on a delay and you miss the timing when you are trying to get action shots of the kids.  This camera has a setting so that you can just hold the button in and it takes a series of pictures.

The quality of photos produced by my old camera led me to believe that this new camera would be of equal quality.  I must say I was very disappointed in the photo quality.  Unless you were right on top of what you were shooting, the photos were grainy, out of focus or blurred.  The pictures I took were not fast action or night shots--the shutter speed was not a factor.  I found that the most blurring was on photos where I had used the zoom feature.

I am just a causal picture taker so I was looking for a camera that was easy to use and this is perfect. The pictures come out crystal clear and the camera is so easy to use. I love the LCD screen. For me the screen is large enough to take a quality picture. The buttons are easy to use and camera itself is very sleek and extremely lightweight. I read through the instruction manual to get an idea of how to use some of the more complicated features but if you don't have time for this it's okay. The auto shoot mode is great!I only have one issue with this camera. It only holds like 15MB of data which is nothing. I was just playing around with the camera and took like three pictures and a message came up that the memory was full! Not good...so I HAVE to buy a Sony Memory Stick so I can save my pictures.

This was our first trip to Europe.  I wanted a camera that would capture once in a life time memories.  The camera is small, light weight and has a good battery life.  The problem is the picture quality.  The camera took great pcitures of landscapes but failed when it came to indoor shots (day and night)and people at night.When I developed the pictures of my daughter(size 4,6) the majority  were grainy and the edges of her hair and face were blurry.I set the camera settings correctly so that was not the issue.  The problem is that the camera lacks consistency.  My daughters 2 year old Cannon took much better pictures and was about $50 less than this one.Thankfully I had a SLR as my main camera.

As a longtime leader in electronics, this camera has developed a reputation as being problematic. Just look in the eBay listings and you'll see countless DSC-W220 cameras being sold for parts. WHY? because after the initial honeymoon, the lens of this camera will NOT stand the test of time. My camera's zoom lens failed within the warranty period. I sent it in to the repair center in Laredo TX ... no replacement, but they repaired it (or so I thought) ...within 2 months, the lens failed again. The aperture fails to open, so no light reaches the camera's inner electronics. Since I contacted them slightly AFTER 90 days. They have the audacity to suggest I pay $107 to get it repaired again. I'm gonna risk that, when they didn't fix it the first time?! I called again, and they said they'd cover a \"percentage\" of the repair. What a disgrace! I'm gonna try again to get a resolution, and if so I will be happy to post the results. If not, I will NEVER, EVER BUY or promote SONY EVER again.

It is an excellent camera for the novice.  Colors are sharp and it takes pictures very quickly.  The feature set is ample, easy to use, but offers plenty of fine tuning for the enthusiast.  I strongly recommend this camera.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Panduka B.

I've never had a digital camera before, never shot one, didn't know squat about any of them, so I perused all the dozens of cameras looking for the ones with all 5 star reviews or next best.This camera had stellar reviews, so I bought it. Yes, it takes fantastic pictures, but NO MEMORY STICK is included! I had a permit to climb Mt. Whitney this week and the weather was holding, but had to cancel due to not having a shoot-ready camera! We contacted Sony, they said there was enough memory in the camera for 96 pictures. Great, I rescheduled the hike, but after Sony walked us through setting it up for the 96 pictures, the camera would not give us those. I took 3 which should have given us a balance of 93, but it knocked down to 62, then refused to let us take any more pictures. When you order this camera you're not getting it all. Memory sticks start at $44.95 up to $149.95, so factor those costs into the cost of this camera. Biting my nails hoping Sony Fed-Ex's the memory stick in time for my hike next week!When I get the thing up and running, I will edit this review and probably give it another 5-star review, but I'm highly pissed that the fact the camera was not shoot-ready was not posted in big, bold red letters or something to better catch your attention. The Product Info does say Memory Stick not included, but for a digital newbie like me, I wasn't familiar with the termonology.It's small as a pack of playing cards which is great for hiking as it is light weight enough to carry and to pack.OK, got the memory stick by Fedex who, per tracking, let it languish in Chicago for TWO DAYS! Pony Express is cheaper and more reliable than Fed Ex.Took the camera to Mt. Whitney yesterday. The moon was setting behind a peak at 3:30AM with violent storm clouds swirling about it like a horror movie. For the heck of it, shot some pictures. Wow, not only did it take quality pictures in the dead of night, but they came out fantastic enough to make a poster of. It looked as if the moon was arising out of Hell and on fire. Then to the east horizon the ISS was streaming for the sun which had not even arisen, turning gold. The camera picked up the tiny speck of light that was the ISS.Love it, can't stop taking pictures of EVERYTHING! If my 87 yr old mother learns to use this camera and likes it, I'll buy one for her.5 STARS for this camera!", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "!
