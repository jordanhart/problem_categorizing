They both loved being able to take photos very easily and were able to maneuver their way around all the controls. For my younger daughter, the highlight was just taking the photos. We helped her create the puppets with the software provided and had a lot of fun doing this craft together. My older daughter was able to utilize the software on her own for the most part and tried out all the different games and crafts pretty much on her own. This camera's price and ease of use was perfect for our kids. I did not expect it to operate like our $500 camera, but more like their first experience with a digital camera and it held up to our expectations.", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not Worth It!", "Author": "Phoenix Smith", "ReviewID": "R2944NOHQ3X9C6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my son.

We bought the first one and had to take it back the same day.  She took maybe 10 pictures with it before the batteries died, which means that the pictures were lost.  We used the manufacturer suggested batteries.  She (and we) are very disappointed that Crayola would put their name to this product.  Since we didn't get to print any of the pictures, we can't say much about the picture quality.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Waste of money", "Author": "Kimberley", "ReviewID": "RG6535EWXROFH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my 5 year old nephew and it was a complete waste of money. You would think that for $40 the camera would be decent, but you'd be wrong. The box is closed on the back, so in the store you can't see how big the LDC preview screen is, and once you open it you find that it is only about an inch big. Then once you turn the camera on, you find that the preview image is horrible. The image, if you can even call it an image, is blurry and grainy and completely undecipherable. For a camera that is marketed towards children who thrive on instant gratification, it fails to deliver and is useless. My nephew took one picture, saw that he couldn't see the picture, and never touched the camera again. Do not waste your money on this camera.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not Compatible With Windows Vista", "Author": "L.

We have not had any problems with losing pictures or poor battery life.  Our problem is that the software is not compatible with Windows Vista, so we have no way to get the pictures off the camera.  Crayola Customer support was terrible, the only thing they could tell me was to return the cameras.

She loves it. It has few buttons, so it's easy to learn to use. I didn't install the software yet, she hasn't noticed. I like that the batteries and SD card slot are secured from tiny hands just pulling them out, but the tiny screws were a pain. At least I had a small screwdriver handy. I like that it has an SD card and not just internal memory. One big drawback is the flash. It whitewashes everything almost unrecognizable. And it takes a few seconds between pushing the shutter button and when it flashes or takes a picture. At first this resulted in a lot of blurry pictures. Now that my daughter has gotten the hang of it though, it's better. The display screen is small and blurry and fairly useless, but my daughter loves it anyway. I'd give it a 2, but my daughter would give it a 5, so I gave it a 4, since it's her camera after all.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "I hate it - my kid loves it", "Author": "Pat Swanson", "ReviewID": "R28TSUFN2W0SA9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The preview screen is worthless.  Unless your subject stands perfectly still or you have steady hands the pictures come out blurry.  The flash causes anything close to be all white in the picture.  The camera makes a \"Click\" sound a full second before the flash goes off so it tends to cause your subject to move just before the pic is taken.  I have luckily not experienced the losing power/pictures issue.  Regardless off all those things that simply drive me mad my 7 year old loves her camera and taking pictures and using the software.  She would rate it a 5, I would rate it a 1 so I'll give it a 3.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "frustrated mom", "Author": "cake mom", "ReviewID": "R3909ZYSAMGS9D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this is actually the second camera we bought as a Christmas gift as the original one was defective out of the package and we were able to return it and replace it at the store.  The replacement one is just as awful as the first.  It only worked the first two times, then quit working altogether.  When I e-mailed the company (as directed on the packaging) to inquire about the warranty and repair instructions, I was given the run-around and told they cannot honor a warranty if you don't hang on to the receipt.  Who hangs on to a receipt for a year as the warranty promises?!  It is bad enough for a company to knowingly put out such a lousy product, but to market it to children is simply terrible.

So I did and it worked once but no longer works every time I turn off the camara I loose the pictures with and without the phot memory card.(2) I installed the software and it worked. I pluged in the camara and the pictures came up, but as soon as you close out of the program you will loose all of your pictures. I tried saving it under another file, I tried saving it every way I could but the pictures did not stay in the program so that you could go back and look or play with the pictures.This camara was the biggest waste of my money.

How awful is it?(1)  Things started off on the wrong foot when I had trouble putting the battery cover back on.  The cover comes completely off and you have to align two tiny screws with their holes to put it back on.(2)  My daughter excitedly started to snap pictures, but the pictures on the view screen were dark, blurry, and almost pixelated.  As you move the camera around, the image on the view screen does not move smoothly, but jitters about.(3)  The automatica flash either does not come on when it clearly should or it flashes laughably late:  Click the shutter, begin to put down the camera, the flash goes off two seconds after you took the shot.(4)  The software is problematic.  My Windows computer is only three years old.  The software froze.  I downloaded the driver, was prompted to reboot my computer, and I did so.  When I attempted to download the images, I was told that there were no drivers.  I again installed the drivers, but I kept getting the same message about having no drivers, so I never could download the pictures.(5)  In its \"good\" setting (i.e., terrible images), the camera can only hold 24 pictures.(6)  The directions warn you ominously that if you replace your batteries, you will lose all images on the camera.  So if your kid is having fun with the camera and the batteries die, you can't change them without losing your kid's pictures.  Great.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy", "Author": "K.
