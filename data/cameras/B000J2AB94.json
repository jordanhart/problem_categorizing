The battery charge system was just weird. The camera was not up to the hype when light was poor. But the images with good light were stunning. So it was with some angst, sustained by a delayed product release, that I opened my camera SD14. Very early on I knew I had a problem in that the camera hung... motion? But I got off some really spectacular images before sending it to NY repairs. They got it back quickly. I suspect something loose.Well the images are simply wonderful. Just so you know, I have cameras at 5 & 6 times the price considered high end professional. I can get lots more pixels, but the color quality is not better.The real test was low light. All the digital cameras fail in low light. So just a matter of how bad. OK, something is new here. This camera is far better in dim light than the SD10. When it starts to fail to low light the images become blotchy - like camoflage - rather than sandy as the GRGB cameras tend.The SD14 X3F RAW images do well in Adobe's new Lightroom, and interestingly with the many controls for image modification in that program, there are none that set this camera aside (for punishment for being different).The SD10 used a 1 GByte card but did not take larger. I tested the SD14 on 1 Gig (mechanical IBM type) and on 2 Gig, and 4 Gig, and 8 Gig CFII cards. Though, beware, some cards do badly with certain cameras across the board.  So, I cannot say that ALL CFII's are OK. But I was able to find cards that worked a large range of memory capacity.The camera saves images as RAW or JPEG. You can select two \"color spaces\", sRGB or AdobeRGB. I found that odd. Why not a 16 bit option? I suspect that is simply understood for RAW.The booklet that comes with the camera may be the clearest such booklet of any camera. There were a few minor areas where referring the user to other sources seemed lazy(C1----v  C2----v  C3----v for camera strobes might be obvious to those who have these but ought to be explained to those who don't and maybe might want to).Also the SD14 can shoot \"tethered\" - a huge fact that gets barely any mention other than an arrow pointing at the port. Those who do that, know, but maybe some need to learn how?The camera body is nicely shaped, the controls are very logical, and shooting is easy.There is something about the color. The SD10 drove me nuts because I had to charge batteries in shifts (they didn't all fit in the charger at once... grrrr). I almost dismissed this camera from that experience alone. The low light limits of the SD10 were also hard to take. But, that color. Seems even better in the SD14. It is not like other cameras. Just isn't. Very pleasing rich deep textural color.So, down side? Well Sigma is not a magnet for lenses made by other manufacturers. So you will probably be a Sigma all the way person. But the Sigma lenses I used were quite good and cost way way less than other brands. There is a specific flash kind for the flash shoe. So, maybe your current flash might not work? The built-in flash, does what built in flashes do.The SD14 battery system is quite nice. There is a built-in dust protector to assist lens swaps - very nice.Want to do very high end photography with a wide array of lenses without going broke?

It struggles at high ISO settings and its LCD display is sub-par.  The fps speed is slow and it takes a long time to write to the CF card from the buffer.  You are stuck with Sigma lenses and I can't say that the 14.1 MP rating is s true 14.1 MP.  But at the end of the day, when used for what it is intended - to take pictures - it produces the most beautiful and stunningly real, film like, dynamic, true color results.  If you want features and functionality but lower quality pictures, go ahead and buy another camera, one without a Foveon sensor.  If your after the best digital pictures available, shoot with the different cameras and review the results in a blind test.  Chances are you will be a Sigma owner like me.  That is what I did and I chose the Sigma.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "The best 4.5 megapixel camera on earth!", "Author": "Brendan Getchel", "ReviewID": "R1E90L1B7STAVI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've owned the SD9 and now the SD14. The only two lenses I own for the SD are the Sigma 150/EX Macro and the 10-20/EX zoom. I shoot predominately Canon (1Ds/2, 1D/2, 30D and assorted lenses) but have a soft spot for the Foveon X3 technology, which produces a \"look\" that is difficult to replicate using a non-X3 \"CFA\" sensor (the type used in all other dSLRs).First, don't be caught up in the various hyperbolic statements by Foveon/Sigma marketing and X3 zealots. The SD14 is really a 4.5 (not 14) megapixel camera. Photographs are two-dimensional (flat) representations. An 8x10 photo is still 8x10 even when you stack three red, green, and blues ones on top of each other. The SD14 has \"only\" 4.5MP in an X/Y space, which is all that matters. It's *how* the SD14 captures each one of those pixels that gives it an advantage over cameras with similar resolution. When it comes to resolving detail, the SD14 is roughly equivalent to the current crop of 8-10MP digital SLRs, and due to the unique nature of how its sensor captures those details gives it an edge to some believers. I like to use the SD for macro and some landscape photography, but since my acquisition of the 16MP Canon 1Ds Mk2 the SD14 has gotten little use. The SD14 easily matches both of my 8MP 1D/2 and 30D for both genres of photography, and in some ways produces images more to my personal tastes, but the 1Ds is clearly superior (as it should be for an $8,000 camera body).If you like the unique results the SD14 is capable of, and your style of photography does not require advanced features like fast shooting, a high-performance AF system, and some other features found in most competing brands then the SD may be just the thing for you. Since landscapes don't run around and most macro subjects don't either it is perfect for these tasks -- especially at its current low price around $800. However, if your photography style is mixed and you may just as frequently find yourself capturing quick, fleeting subjects, or you need a deep buffer with a fast frame rate (ie: a responsive camera) then the SD14 is definitely NOT the body for you. The autofocus (AF) system is generations behind those in even the low end of modern dSLRs such as the Nikon D80 or Canon 40D, and leagues behind the current crop of high performance offerings like the Canon 1D or Nikon D3 or D300 series.In short, most 10MP cameras can and do offer more compelling features, etc with likewise similar image quality, but for a narrow set of parameters the Foveon-equipped SD14 brings a \"uniqueness\" to the image capture that no other camera can offer. If that is your primary criteria then I can recommend the SD14. Unfortunately, much of this advantage evaporates once the image is put to print.So, thumbs up if you're a landscape or macrophile. Otherwise the average customer would be better served by most of the more capable brands' offerings.", "Date": "December 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Image Quality for the Price", "Author": "Michael J. James III", "ReviewID": "R1252GB8SXVR4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Canon 5D and Nikon D3 and my Sigma SD14's image quality is on par with both of these cameras.However,...... it does have a few shortfalls.  Such as:1.  In low light conditions,... shadows will have \"blotchy\" noise and speckles of magenta compared to the same shot taken with a 5D/D3 at the same ISO settings.  This can even happen in daylight conditions where there is a very wide dynamic range.  The SD14 will expose correctly for the image, but the deep shadows will at times fail to render details in the shadows and those blotchy/magenta characteristics will appear.2.  Poorer AWB in mixed lighting than the 5D/D3.3.  Small buffer.  If you need to keep up with action (sports, etc..), then you will be disappointed that after a burst of 6-8 shots the camera will lock up and take 5-20 seconds to write all that data to the card.  And faster CF cards won't help.  It is the buffer.  The fact is that the processing is complicated and does not process quickly for fast shooting environments.  Yes it will shoot 3fps, but the buffer is so small that you only get a little over a handful of shots and then the camera needs time to process that burst.The positives?1.  ISO 50-200 in daylight conditions is spectacular.  I prefer the SD14 over my 5D/D3 up to 200 ISO.2.  Image sharpness is amazingly crisp and has a 3D type feel that you can only appreciate if you have shot with this camera and a Canon/Nikon in the same shooting conditions.  I have done so from the same tripod to compare shots taken  with similar lenses in the same lighting conditions and can attest to the differences.3.  You can use Canon speedlites to use within wireless ETTL setups.  I have two Sigma EF 500 DG flash units and three Canon 580EX II speedlights.  I set the Canon's to ETTL slaves and the two sigma's to wireless and then the camera to wireless.  You can set all of the flash units to either channel 1, 2 or 3, then match that with the camera's channel output to fire off all the flashes.  The camera meters properly using this mix of flash units.  I found all this out by accident.  I was testing out the 5D and wireless flash setup VS. the SD14 and wireless flash setup.  I had left the 2 Canon speedlights on while I fired off the SD14's and expected only the sigma EF 500 DG units to fire.  The canons did as well and the SD14 metered for all four properly.I'd have to go further into details to review all the pros and cons.  I'll just say that as a 5D and D3 owner, the SD14 can hang in image quality.  And in good daylight environments I prefer it to the IQ of either the 5D or D3.  The SD14 is at a minimum, on par with both respectively and often trumps those two when lighting is strong.Also, the dynamic range of the SD14 seems to be wider than reported.  I don't know why.  In lightroom I'm amazed at the amount of details I can recover in the highlights VS. 5D/D3.  Maybe it is the fact that because the SD14 captures R,G,B on each pixel, those hightlights are of better quality and it is able to pull those details out of the highlights for that reason.  I don't know.  It just \"is what it is\".Well worth the purchase.  The far lower price point makes up for it's low light performance.  Using flash or strong daylight environments, the SD14 can hang with ANY $2000-$5000 DSLR.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera with fantastic image quality", "Author": "Kendall H. Gelner", "ReviewID": "R3RTEWTE7OIKCJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will start the review with a disclaimer that I had the chance to beta-test this camera before release; That also means I have had a few months experience in shooting with the camera.I will start out with a little history.  A few years ago, Sigma released the SD-9 and SD-10 digital cameras.  They were widely hailed to have excellent image quality, but the trouble for some buyers was that the cameras did not have some convinced features that other cameras offered, like in-camera JPEG or on-camera flash, and so they went on to other systems.Fast forward to today and the SD-14.  Sigma has addressed all the little aspects of usability and features that people have asked for, like in-camera JPEG, on camera flash, PC-Sync socket, and many other little features.  But best of all, in addition to adding more resolution, they also improved the image quality from the sensor even further - the camera has even more dynamic range, and much better high ISO support than before with everything up to 800 working really well and even 1600 being usable.  This is a camera with a feature set that just about anyone can make use of, and leave the choice of the body to image quality rather than body features.When considering a camera like the SD-14, it really is important to understand the difference the Foveon sensor makes as this camera really is different than any other camera on the market today.  Look at sample images (look at full-size sample images, not shrunken down web versions!).  Read about the Foveon sensor.  The use that information to make up your mind if this is the right camera for you.  For fine art work or landscapes, I'm really not sure there is anything better.Sigma deserves a lot of credit for daring to continue updating the camera line with this unique sensor in a market full of otherwise very similar choices (except for Fuji, props there).You can read more here about the Foveon and Bayer sensors compared in terms of detail captured and the information about resolution charts you should know:[...]And you can find full-size sample images either on the Sigma-sd14.com web site or here in the user galleries:[...]", "Date": "March 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "super camera", "Author": "William J. O'Connor \"film buff\"", "ReviewID": "R3N6ZVRHN0M0YC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long-time Sigma digital camera user. I have used an SD9 in my fine-art photography business for four years. When the SD-14 came out, I was figuring out how to budget for the $1500 purchase price of the new body, when its price started dropping. Imagine my surprise when I found it on AMAZON for a third of its original price!The camera has had lukewarm to lousy reviews, largely because the reviewers of digital cameras want a camera to shoot at ASA 5000 at 8 frames per second. Of course they never show us any of the fabulous images they've shot under those conditions.The Sigma is an honest camera, at ASA 100, 200 or 400, it shoots beautiful files with its unique Foveon chip. Printers, who reproduce the images I shoot, love my files because they are so clean and free of digital artifacts.The increased file size from the SD9 is very welcome and Sigma has always had the best software in the business. Sigma lenses test out as fine as anything made by Canon or Nikon, and are, at times, superior.My only complaint comes from the fact that an AC converter is not sold with the body. My SD9 came with one. Sigma will gleefully sell me one for $135, an outrageous price for a $35 dollar item.The new Sigma is faster, has a bigger screen in the back, has a pop-up flash, a PC connection for external flash and is a joy to use.At this price, and while they last, there is no better deal in photography.", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great image quality--for obsessive photographers", "Author": "Douglas Henderson", "ReviewID": "R1SR1KSGWB0AGP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had an SD14 for a little over a month--and it has taken me this long to begin to get the hang of Sigma's RAW file conversion in SPP 2.3 (this is Sigma's updated RAW conversion software for Mac's that must be downloaded, so far--new SPP 3.1 is apparently on the way).  Having convinced myself that satisfactory images can be acquired from RAW files, I'm inclined, finally, to give the camera a thumbs up.  Further color correction in Phototshop helps, as well.As for the camera, it is hefty, well built and essential functions are easy to get to. Have to say, I've been thoroughly spoiled by the ease of using several Olympus E-series cameras (which are smaller, lighter and faster to focus and shoot). But if you take your time, the SD14 seems to work well in the field.  It does not have an independently operating Exposure Lock (it's coupled awkwardly with holding the shutter button half depressed).  And exposure is important with this camera--the sensor is intolerant of underexposure, otherwise, odd colors creap into the darker tones.  As a consequence, setting the EV to +.7 (yes, PLUS 2/3's of a stop) is a practical exposure compensation. I would never have found this to be the case by problem-solving on my own--just adopted suggestions from a Sigma online forum.  Dynamic range is very good and recovery of highlights in RAW files is remarkable.The initial RAW converted images that pop up on the monitor look as if from some saturated, other yellow-tinted universe, but careful color temperature correction in the software brings back images to something like reality--and to a very pleasing degree.  The tendency for images to show warm colors is also something worth cultivating for iself. And getting most or all of the green out is possible with careful postprocessing.  Photoshop, to repeat myself, is also a big help. Other RAW conversion software is available for Sigma cameras as well.I returned the first SD14 because of some color issues--but this may well have been due to my inexperience.  The second camera behaves much like the first.  Both cameras exhibited faint dust shadows on the sensors--perhaps dust behind the dust screen from the factory. Not a serious issue--but if dust must be removed from the interior of the camera, I plan to have Sigma do it. A wall power converter is required to clean the interior of the camera and it is an optional $75.00 item not included in the camera assessories.I'd recommend getting Sigmas' better glass--the EX lenses.  The sensor can handle resolution of the best Sigma offers.  I've compromised (due to price and hesitancy to leap with both feet with Sigma) and acquired a used 15-30mm EX and a new 28-70mm EX--neither ideal and both lenses requiring (seemingly) being stopped down anywhere from F8 to F16 for best images. Together with the 50 ASA possibilities of the SD14 (unique for larger DSLR's?), this will likely require resorting to a tripod because of the slow shutter speeds. I've been handholding shots at 100 ASA with good results.I'm probably writing this review too soon--there is much left to do to see what this camera can and cannot do.  But certainly, this camera is for those wanting image quality over consumer convenience--short of turning to large-format photography.  Image quality is impressive.  Image files are not especially large, but can be sharpen to a remarkable degree.  I'm waiting for spring, so I have something more than dry grass, snow and frozen, brown landscapes to photograph.Update 1/30/08: Adobe Photoshop CS3 with the latest Camera Raw (4.1.3) upgrade does a simply stellar job processing Sigma RAW files.  It also easily converts any Sigma TIFF files saved from other developing software so images can be modifiend with Photoshop Raw tools.Another Update 6/21/08: Exposures at ISO 50 with the SD14 should be managed differently than exposures at ISO 100 or higher.  Exposing at ISO 100 or higher generally requires exposing for shadow areas, as if using negative film.  At these ISO speeds, the sensor will produce odd color blotches in dark areas of an image if given too little exposure.  There is a seeming enormous capacity to recover highlights from exposures that favor exposing for shadows.  Good exposures in ISO 100 initially look much too overexposed.  But the software will bring it back, within reason.In contrast, when shooting ISO 50, one should expose for highlights, as if using slide film.  ISO 50 seems to have less headroom for recoverying highlights, so the exposure needs to compensate for this.  Having captured highlights, recovery of darker areas shot in ISO 50 appears superior to underexposed darker areas shot at ISO 100.  Proper ISO 50 exposures initially look much more like properly exposed images when developed in Sigma software. The camera clearly shows a difference in image capture between ISO 50 and ISO 100 (and faster speeds).  Also, Sigma software has been further updated--and appears to give better color results and sharpening than CS3 with initial RAW development (always a matter of taste).  Photoshop RAW tools can be used to fine-tune the finished image, remove CA, remove dust moots, etc.I've been hauling my SD 14 all over Yellowstone with fine results.

Kunkel", "ReviewID": "R1OLY4XIE7NH9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sold my Canon 40D and lenses (Including L glass) to fund my purchase of the Sigma SD14.  I miss the low light ability and the all around speed of the 40D.  I miss the superior battery life and the ability to shoot full frame (If I bought another camera body) with the same lenses that I invested in for the Canon. I miss the stable operation (No lock-ups) of the 40D.  The Canon 40D is an excellent camera, and is hands down a highly recommended option for many people who are into photography, I really do miss it in many ways.But wait, this isn't a review of the Canon 40D, it is a review of the Sigma SD14.  I would not trade back my SD14 with all of it's quirks (You must have read about them all if you got this far, and are interested in buying one) for the 40D.  The reason is that when I look at my photos, I realize that nothing in my budget could get me anywhere near the quality of the images that I get from the SD14.  I'm not a very good photographer, I'm still learning every day.  But the learning experience is full of excitement with what this camera can produce.  I don't care about all of what this camera cannot do when I sit down and have a look at what it can do- which is reward the effort of taking pictures with images that invoke everything from thoughts of \"wow, did I really take that picture?\" to a deep feeling in my gut that I really can one day arrive at my goal of producing images that reflect how I see the world.For those of you who can afford to add the SD14 to your current system- you are in a fortunate position to explore this little gem without giving up on the stronger points (High ISO, high speed, stability, etc.) of your current camera.For those of you who are thinking about getting started with digital SLR's, keep reading everything you can on the internet before making your decision, you will be giving up a lot of capabilities of the other camera systems, but if you have the same experience that I have had with the images, you may just find the SD14 to be the camera for you.For those of you (like me) who would have to sell their current camera and lenses to purchase the SD14, all I can say is- I'm not in a position to tell you if it is the right decision for you, but I don't regret it for a second.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sigma SD14 user for 8 months", "Author": "S. Fleischmann", "ReviewID": "R2JLOD7EK0BYXE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 8 months of SD14 usage, I still consider my earlier review posted on dpreview.com website as accurate. The SD14 has had various firmware updates as well, making it in my opinion an even more versatile camera. For example, you can now shoot ISO50 with extraordinary detail and virtually no noise in shadows, especially an advantage to landscape photographers.People not truly familiar with the Foveon technology will argue over the megapixel rating, but in actual usage, the SD14 can and does equal image quality coming from much more expensive or 'higher' MP-rated cameras. The Sigma forum at dpreview.com has links to such comparisons.My earlier review:The SD14 is smaller in size than previous models SD9 (2002) and SD10 (2003) but still somewhat larger than the 'smallest' other brand DSLRs. The SD14 is solid and well-balanced, thus for me much easier to hold and hand shoot. My favorite new feature: SD14 has a new toggle control on the back to select ISO, shooting mode (RAW or various settings of in-camera JPEG), RAW-JPEG resolutions and white balance. You can see these from the specification sheets, so I won't detail the settings' options. But in use, it is very easy to check, choose, and change your settings without digging into menu trees. The built-in flash is useful (and SD14s also of course support external flash units).I believe most photographers are drawn to the Sigma SD14 by the high image quality produced by the Foveon sensor; in this, the SD14 is in a class by itself. Fine image quality and details captured are extraordinarily good. While a beginner can put the SD14 on \"P\" mode (automatic mode) and shoot satisfactorily, this camera allows photographers to grow into its (and their) full capabilities. It doesn't have pre-set 'modes' (sunset, landscape, portrait, sports or 'child' modes as some other DSLRs today), it is more a clean, classic photographers' camera.In sum, controls and settings are simple to use, and the image quality is extraordinarily good.", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "It's no longer worth the investment!", "Author": "mars198 \"photomars\"", "ReviewID": "R1W9FOBVZTR37J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Compared to the newer cameras of today the sd14 is on it's last leg.

Without sufficient lighting, pictures can be dark and grainy. On the other hand, Nikon D40 produces better indoor pictures.If you are upgrading from a point and shoot camera and have less than a thousand dollars to spend, I suggest you get the Nikon D40 with its kit lens and the AF-S 55-200mm VR lens. Number of megapixels does not matter, but the sensor size does. D40 has the same sensor size as D300!If you don't look at price tags when you shop, then the Canon 1Ds is for you.

It should not be your first DSLR to buy because it is not an all around camera to use (IMO). If you are planning to buy your first DSLR, Nikon D60 or Canon XSi should be a better choice since that's what they're designed for.The Sigma SD14 has a very unique image sensor (Foveon X3) that can produce a very sharp and beautiful color image under sufficient lighting. However under dim light, images could be disappointed due to high noise and grainy. Using Sigma's own Photo Processing software to process the RAW (X3F) files is truly joyful.The SD14 is a big improvement over the previous models (SD9 and 10) on design. The camera body feel very comfortable in the hand, shutter noise is nice and quiet, much improved battery system, a build-in flash... Besides, when you take off Sigma's unique dust protection filter on the body and add an infrared filter on the front of the lens, you can turn the SD14 into an IR ready camera and open up a whole new photography field.Sigma is planning to have a new SD15 coming out soon so the SD14 has drop to an unbelievable price.

But, it is not for the beginner or novice shooter! It has no auto modes or fancy shooting modes, just the bare basics a Professional needs! Resolution is on par with a Canon 5D full frame sensor camera. Color reproduction is unmatched thanks to the FoveonX3 sensor technology capturing all RGB colors instead of interpolating(guessing) at 2 of the three colors per photosite. Dynamic range on the SD14 is quite simply, insane! It is almost impossible to blow highlights as the data is till there and they can be recovered easily. It is best to overexpose your images by at least +.7EV. Because the SD14's one downfall is the nasty color blotching in seriously underexposed areas.Another superb feature of the SD14 is the ability for the user to remove the cut pass filter and turn the camera into a full time IR(infrared) camera with the addition of an IR filter to the lens. Or shoot without IR filter for IR+VIS light imaging.If you are a B&W; shooter, then the SD14 is also for you!! It is amazing in B&W; due to the superb Dynamic Range(DR).But colors are, of course, phenomenal! No issues with red or shades of red like Bayer based sensor cameras(Canon, Nikon, etc.) have! All colors are recorded on each photosite, therefore true colors are reproduced.While the SD14 can do sports, I would look elsewhere for a fast paced lower light sports camera. I don't mind the SD14 for this because I am used to manual film cameras for shooting sports, lol.But, for portraiture, weddings, product photography, macros, nature, wildlife, etc. it is hard to beat the SD14. For landscapes, it is next to impossible to beat it short of a medium format digital camera.The SD14 CAN do tethered shooting just fine, do it all the time with my laptop. :).The Sigma ProPhoto software is also very top notch, very much like Lightroom.For conventional lenses you are stuck with Sigma, but that is NOT a bad thing!! Sigma makes some of the ebst consumer and professional lenses on the market! You can also purchase a low cost M42 thread mount adapter and use any older M42 screw mount lenses on your SD14 in manual focus, but still with focus lock confirmation. :). There are also other adapters to convert the SD14's SD mount to another brand's mount.My only true complaint is the odd blotching in seriously underexposed areas when you try to recover them and the somewhat flimsy battery door. Other then that the SD14 gets my full recommendations and kudos!I only gave it 3 stars for ease of use because most novice or beginning shooters will find it having a large learning curve because of it not having any of the auto and scene modes on it.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sigma SD14", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R2TK7A5F9YF0IN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sigma SD14's were expensive when they first came out, but I just couldn't resist when price dropped below $300, too bad price has gone back up again lately.For a digital camera of this calibre, and like most other high end digital cameras, shooting RAW and processing it properly will give you the best results, however its JPG files are really quite excellent as well as long as you know how to adjust WB, exposure, and other parameters correctly to your liking according to the shooting conditions.Controls are very intuitive, straight forward, and easy to use, many testers complain about the \"one-way\" user interface but trust me, after using it just a couple of weeks you will have it easily memorized and you will know exactly what comes next.  Those who complain are simply unfamiliar with its controls.This is not a camera for beginners, you really do need to practice sound photographic techniques to get the most out of it, also using Sigma's top the line EX lenses will certainly help bring the most out of its unique Foveon X3 sensor.Sigma SD14 is a really unique product, currently there is really nothing in the market place quite like it.

On first impression the Sigma SD14 is a big clunky camera; wider and taller than the Canon XTi, and XSi, and much much bigger than the Panasonic G1. However, it doesn't feel extremely heavy which makes me think that it's mostly plastic. It does give the overall feeling that it was designed for people with big hands, but in practice, while a fist-full, the controls fell nicely under my fingers--a comfortable grip that balances well. The 2.5 inch LCD screen, 150,000 pixels, is coarse and barely adequate for seeing the histogram and exposure info. The stop-down preview button is excellent, as is the QS (quick-set) button which makes it easy and fast to alter ISO, Format, and White Balance. The viewfinder is very clear and bright, and I really like Sigma's choice of placement for the Drive and Mode Dials at top. I was surprised at how well-dampened the camera was for vibration and noise.Image quality: Highly detailed, rich, nuanced color. Usually amazingly beautiful. Even stunning at times. I find myself wowed by its quality, depending on the lens. The Foveon sensor loves light and I found a big difference in the midtone tonalities just by adjusting from ISO 200 to 100. In sunlight at ISO 100 midtones are silky-smooth; but shooting at ISO 200 on an overcast day produced big, ugly, blotchy noise patterns in the midtones and shadows. (Here the Sigma DP1 is superior at ISO 200 and even 400.) Limiting oneself to shooting at ISO 100 especially when the camera lacks image-stabilization (only available in certain Sigma lenses) is annoying. Hopefully noise issues will be fixed with the new TRUE II processor in the Sigma SD15.My gripes: Autofocus isn't always accurate; the \"C\" Dial (command Dial) collar surrounding the shutter release is WAY too stiff for single-finger pressure to change aperture/shutter speed/exposure-override combinations which require pressure from thumb-at-the-back and turning the dial at front. It felt awkward. (The design of the Canon Rebel series or the Panasonic G1 is superior in this respect.) The SD14 dial seems like it was designed for someone wearing gloves, which is strange because the camera is not weather-sealed for extreme temperatures. And processing shots is VERY slow. About 5-to-7 seconds (!) to save a RAW file, and if you shoot a burst of six-shots in RAW it takes a whopping 40 seconds to process all of them (30 seconds for JPEG burst). And while it's processing the camera is disabled. If you shoot one, then another, as \"single-shots\" you may not feel the pinch until you exceed the sixth shot. This is NOT the camera for sports or photo-journalism.All in all, the Sigma is the \"only game in town\" if you want the Foveon sensor quality. (I find the Sigma DP1 to be faster at processing RAW files than the SD14.) Would I buy it again? Yes. The quality of its stunning images is unsurpassed (IMHO) but I'm definitely looking forward to improvements in the SD15.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Loved everything but the image quality", "Author": "shrap", "ReviewID": "RHGM03XGPB19", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very, very excited about this camera when I ordered it.  An underdog, it seemed to be getting great reviews here, and it's backed by a good name in lenses.  Excitement turned to disappointment once I started reviewing the images it captured.  I sent it back after less than a week, dissatisfied.I shot everything at the 4.7MP setting, using Sigma's 17-70mm lens (the same lens that turns out great photos on friends' Canon and Nikon bodies).  This was the first DSLR I've owned, but I'm comfortable with manual film SLRs and I've spent time with borrowed Canon Rebel XT and XTis.  This camera was to be an upgrade to my Fuji S602 Zoom, a nice but outdated SLR-ish point-and-shoot with a 3MP sensor.The no-frills controls were great--two dials is definitely the way to go.  The camera is heavy in hand, but not unmanageable.  Great orange-backlit LCD on top of the camera for reviewing settings, though the backlight sometimes wouldn't engage.Autofocus was slower than the Canon system, but fast enough for me.  The delay between the shutter release and the LCD image review was too long, sometimes a few seconds.As for image quality, I was never able to capture a sharp image with this camera.  I took around 100 photos, most indoors and a few outside in the rain, and every one of them lacked the detail I've seen in other samples online.  Soft edges everywhere.In addition, the camera's auto white balance was terrible.  I could shoot at a white sheet of paper under incandescent lighting and wind up with a strong yellow cast.  Not even a calibrated custom white balance setting could compensate for this fault.  Even my Epson digicam from 2000 had better on-camera white balance.Now, white balance isn't so important if you're shooting in RAW.  Sigma's own Photo Pro software doesn't work on my platform (Linux), nor did I expect it to.  I tried RAW a few times, but the dcraw and ufraw processing tools that work well for Canon's RAWs have a bug that adds green banding to Sigma images.  Ordinarily, this would be fine; I don't mind shooting in JPEG most of the time.  But, coupled with the camera's white balance problems that aren't easily correctable in JPEG, I couldn't produce usable photos without full-spectrum lighting.Thinking the softness might be in my head, I tried the SD14 side-by-side with the Canon XTi (with the 18-35mm kit lens) and the Fuji S602 Zoom.  I photographed a photo calendar on a wall about 3' away under bright soft white lighting at 100 ISO (160 on the Fuji, its lowest setting), shooting handheld.  The Canon and Fuji turned out acceptable images, and the Sigma's were soft and yellow.To stack the odds in the Sigma's favor, I even tried shooting RAW (colors be damned), putting the camera on a tripod, using mirror lockup, and focus bracketing (!!) in case the autofocus was miscalibrated or something.  It didn't seem to make much of a difference.  Even with all those additional precautions, I got better image definition from the handheld 3MP Fuji and better overall image quality from the XTi.  I can believe and accept that the XTi might be capable of creating better images, but I couldn't believe the SD14 had trouble matching my rusty trusty Fuji.I started with really high hopes and an open mind, but this camera just couldn't perform for me.(EDIT 2014/02/26: I ended up with a Pentax K7 later in 2009 and couldn't be happier. While its low-light performance has since been outclassed, it has all the features and wheels/buttons/displays of the Sigma with none of the drawbacks.)", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not good enought, unfortunatelly...", "Author": "Alex Vox", "ReviewID": "R3C3MK32KN6XKV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Technology is a tool for us to get some artistic results.

The DSLRs of today are very quick, very precise and full of smart features. The technical image quality is much less concern. Still, many in this generation that grew with film cameras in hands have tender feelings for film look and feel. Must say immediately that under controlled conditions SD14 can deliver. Unfortunately, these conditions stipulate so many requirements that you can use this Sigma only in good daylight or in very well illuminated studio.

This Sigma is anything but fast. Fast doesn't mean machine gun style shooting in all directions, but a readiness to capture the right moment.

The fact the cam captures in 3 arrays does not make it 14M, sorry.
