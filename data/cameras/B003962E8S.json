However the quality of the video is awesome!!4 stars from me... I'm really happy... if I could zoom in while taking a video I would give the camera 5 stars. However I did some research and not many cameras can zoom in while taking HD videos, so all good ;)Battery life and picture quality is what matters most to me!!!", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Practical Camera", "Author": "Adrienne S. Davis", "ReviewID": "R1RY8DGETS6YPT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We intially purchased this camera for our kids but have taken it over.  The lithium battery makes a great difference in the camera always being ready to shoot.  The on/off design is very practical as well.  This model recieved a very good rating from Consumer Reports.  Our photos clarity - both flash & daylight- have been better than anticipated.  Only drawback for the adults is that there is no 'viewer' but the screen is good sized.  Please note that the 'red' camera colour has a distinct pinkish hue.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrible Quality Pictures", "Author": "Jeremiah Edwards", "ReviewID": "R1RI3J3T2A9RFY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a present for my wife.  I tested it and compared it to other digital cameras.  Then, I returned this camera, and bought my wife the Canon SD1300 IS instead because it is clearly a superior camera that costs only a little more.I compared the Panasonic Lumix DMC FP1, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1, the Canon Powershot S500 (my 8 year old malfunctioning digital camera), the Canon Powershot SD1300 IS, and my Canon Rebel T1i (my dSLR...an unfair comparison, but I wanted benchmark for these cheaper cameras).  I had always liked my old Canon S500, but I read some reviews on Amazon and other websites, and it seemed like the Panasonic cameras were really good cameras at a great price.For me, the number one consideration is picture quality.  If you don't have that, you don't have anything.  Things that detract from picture quality are poor signal to noise, lack of sharpness, poor color rendering, and various artifacts.  Therefore, I tested these 5 cameras under different conditions.  I copied the jpegs onto my computer, and I looked at the images at 100% to see how good they really are.  The most revealing results were shot under medium light indoors.  This is very important if you ever want to take any indoor pictures.  The results were as follows (from best to worst):1) Canon T1i (1 year old, about $700), excellent pictures even without flash2) Canon SD1300 IS (brand new, about $110), very good photos for a compact digital camera3) Canon S500 (8 years old, $400 new, not performing as well as it used to)Surprisingly, although this is not shooting as well as it used to 8 years ago, it still outperformed the Panasonic cameras.4) Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1 (brand new, about $90), this had very poor signal to noise and moderately poor color rendering.5) Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP1 (brand new, about $80), this camera performed significantly worse even than the FH1.  The non extending lens is nifty but yields poor photos.In addition to this, I found that the Canon was easier to operate and easier to take videos.Nowadays, compact digital cameras are quite inexpensive.  Do yourself a favor and buy a high quality camera.  More megapixels does NOT necessarily mean better pictures, and having a large optical zoom can sometimes compromise lens quality and thus picture quality.  Also, consider sensor size: this can make a big difference in picture quality, though some manufacturers make better sensors even when comparing sensors of the same size.  In my experience Canon consistently makes high quality digital cameras.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Lil' camera", "Author": "Mr. Pringle", "ReviewID": "RXCE7WZYJVL2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my mother and she loves it. I had to help her abit because she was used to using a slr and I too learned along the way. It takes pretty good photographs and video but you just have to learn how to use it! At first it took some grainy low light photo's indoors and mediocre outdoor photos. I learned that it is not just an easy point and shoot you either have to set a max iso to prevent the grain or select the correct scene that it is in. The little iA button is pretty useful and you should click it once before taking a pic and then click the shutter for photos to come out nice. If you dont and use the regular settings then you will take bad pics. We have taken a couple thousand photos with it so far and it looks like it can handle some more.All in all its a nifty little camera. Although I would rather shoot with my DSLR, i would take one of these on a short trip.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Getting use to it...", "Author": "mebwm90", "ReviewID": "R72SQ3LQ2LA73", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Takes great pictures....not as user friendly as my previous Cannon camera.

It's really small. Mine is black not red. I like the fact that there is no projecting lense to get fouled with dirt and stop working. I'm a point and shooter. Don't want to diddle with the controls. Used it in a dark bar and the flash took 2 pictures very well and 2 didn't have enough light. All others come out OK. Can't beat it for the price.

The pictures taken from Fp1 have fine quality compared to other brands. Zoom and flash work very well. I had chance to try the Fp3 too. Both have almost same features. Panasonic just upgraded Fp3 with a touchable screen and a slightly higher resolution. However, I think 10 to 12 megapixels is the best for me because i can have more pictures store on my memory card.

I charged the battery (the green light on the charger turned on, then went off meaning the battery was fully charged), put it in, and powered the camera on. It let me catch a glimpse of the screen with full battery icon and shut off. I put the battery in the charger again: the green light went on - ? Well, left it to charge until the light was off, and tried again -- the the same pitiful result.What a disappointment. Ruined Christmas surprise and hassle with return.UPDATEI purchased a replacement, and when it's arrived, I realized that the defective camera was somebody's return. The packaging, labels, tags, etc. clearly indicated that the camera was A USED ITEM, NOT NEW. Unbelievable. Since I returned the lemon, I wonder, if anybody else got it after me--apparently Amazon sees nothing wrong in reselling returns as brand new items.
