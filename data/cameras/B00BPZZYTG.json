Mitzi", "ReviewID": "R1DS3FTMM5GIV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looking for a camera for school in-house/marketing purposes and agonized over this one and 2 other comparable cameras (Sony) .... ultimately decided on this one due to several professional reviews and the amount of technology (HD, 30x, editing, pix type etc.) choices this camera provides for its price range/camera type.Few start up features need to be set after the initialization of the camera (by following directions in the provided 'mini' manual -- power-saver time frame a must otherwise it will `shut down' every 30 seconds and will need to `woken up' (set ours to 1 minute),  pixel choice, and sounds per user choice.Light feel to it and can easily be used one-handed, 30x zoom extraordinary with minimal shake/noise, pix clarity out of control in all instances, video mikes (there are 2 on camera body on either side of the flash unit) sound pick up extremely sensitive (there's an extra toggle zoom/macro on the side of lens that makes zooming in and out easier when filming).Features---amazing: in-camera editing, shots per battery life spot on (~ 380 w/ alkaline and much more with lithium), shutter response feather touch, several flash choices.  Auto photo taking setting is nice and there are a lot of pre-set ones to choose from as well and varying pix stylizations.BIG concern was its low light pix taking ability w/out a tripod one of the only points of conflict in reviews---first trial, though, blew it out of the water w/ its superb enhanced low light ability. Used for school performances in low light....needed to take lots of pix with steady hand to get desired shots (deleted the ones that didn't come out just right....who cares...that's what digital photography is all about!) but camera was able to deliver with great results in the end. Its ability to pick up the ambient light and transfer it to the shot is serious! Sure....could have gotten better shots with a tripod/flash but wanted to see how it performed without and was impressed beyond words.Cons:  The lens cover needs to be manually removed and takes some getting used to doing it after turning on camera and before trying to take a shot and the battery flip-cover (in my opinion) is the only real weak link. It seems really flimsy and has a specific way to open/close ---the brackets that keep it attached to camera feel like they'd break off with strong touch or closing that wasn't spot on.The camera can be purchased stand alone or in a package which is comprehensive and complete....the only other item/s purchased were an extra set of lithium rechargeable batteries to have as a back-up set, as it came with a set (as well as a set of 'regular' AA batteries)  It didn't come with the USB flash drive as shown but it did come with a set of  video cables which wasn't show and 2 DVDs (1 for more complete manual and another for photo sharing/editing software).All in all this camera has filled the bill and then some.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Over my expectations.", "Author": "cata", "ReviewID": "R24295R7LD4R3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, about the camera: I am not an profesional but I can tell you that I make photo to more than 100m and the resolution was over my expectations.

Deciding to buy a camera that wasn't compact (pocket size)took research, but I knew I would be very satisfied with Nikon.  My only issue is many camera features are designed for the right hand, and I am left-handed. No problem, but something to consider along with the size.  The accessory package was a great value with the camera purchase.  The camera case shown is good for storage of accessories, but I use a different case to carry the camera itself.  I printed out the Nikon manual from the included disk, and look forward to trying the many different photo setting options.  Basic UPS delivery was sooner than expected, easily tracked, and arrived in great shape--inside and out.My camera is my art; saving a moment captured in time by photography, is a gift to share with others and save for yourself.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great bargain!", "Author": "Susan W.", "ReviewID": "R2EJEOUHXSFSG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a beginner photographer and still learning all the bells and whistles but it seems to be a great deal!", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing deal", "Author": "Franklin M.", "ReviewID": "R3F77VAE0JB02E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was not only a great deal but takes fantastic pictures.

Easy to use and lovely pictures even without the flash.I had made up my mind to buy the camera and thought this was a good deal since I get the camera and accessories at about the same prize other sellers offered just the camera.Sadly, the accessories were not all as described and thus I couldn't use them. The  supposed LCD screen protector couldn't fit or stick,the spare battery case for holding used up batteries and distinguishing it from the charged ones was just one(different from the description, the advert said two). The camera bag was far from fit for the camera and looked like,a cheap wannabe of a proper camera bag. I was really scared of getting the camera damaged in the bag so I had to do without the bag the whole time.( I definitely would get a more appropriate camera bag). The tripod was too tiny to do any good, and several other stuff I can now call junk.However, I found the batteries that came with the pack was quite solid compared to some other rechargeable batteries I got. It could hold video recording for a little longer than 7mins from full charge before getting exhausted and would take a very good number of pictures before getting exhausted.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Camera is great!", "Author": "Linda Wyatt", "ReviewID": "R39HZKRJJZ03FN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for taking pictures at family events and casual photography.
