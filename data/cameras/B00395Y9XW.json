Not mentioning the pink color...Now, when becoming 6+, she wants to use her dad's camera...As mentioned - photo quality is mediocre (I clean the lens regularly), but all the other features are very nice (\"especially the red hut symbol when focus achieve\" per my daughter.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Be Forewarned!", "Author": "Kathe Beauvais", "ReviewID": "R374Y14YAXU1LW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Be careful with this camera. I had one and dropped it for the first time and it broke! After searching online for what to do or to see if this had happened to others I found out it had happened to many other owners and I would have to get it repaired.It was to cost $70 to repair so I am just going to buy a new one!", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier for the price", "Author": "MomNMore", "ReviewID": "R3F460UADUDYJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little camera is a wonderful value for well under $100.  It seems digital cameras are somewhat disposable these days... breathe on it wrong, it's broken. So after going through a few moderately priced digitals I decided on a cheap one that could be replaced without breaking the bank. This camera has great features that are easy to use - burst shooting, short videos, etc. and it has a long battery life as well.  It is small enough to stick in a pocket and take anywhere, and the lens cover slides down to turn the camera on. I bought two more versions of this camera for both daughters and both are equally happy with theirs.  I highly recommend this for everyday photos and quick point-and-shoot, which is what you need with growing, fast-moving little ones in the house.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lumix Camera", "Author": "dave", "ReviewID": "RC6C0LX9MLQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this as a christmas present.

Brewster", "ReviewID": "R3PI6EHD8FHWAB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have another Panasonic Lumix, but it is a larger camera, I believe the hybrid model.  I wanted something small for vacation.  Upon opening, it never worked.  Charged, but had a lens error, which was funny because I bought this kind hoping to avoid that in the future.  I returned for a refund right away.  Side note ~ I ended up buying an 8 zoom Kodak Easyshare and it lasted not even a month before errors.  Very frustrating to find a pocket sized camera that doesn't break quickly.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Purchased as a gift", "Author": "UncleRed", "ReviewID": "R2ZP88XNQ9TUT9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My daughter loves the size and the color of this camera.
