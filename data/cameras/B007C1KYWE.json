{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A truly unique, exciting, alternative to the \"Canikon\" fleet", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1X6GH3UP1IARE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Most people are not aware that when they buy a conventional (e.g. Canon or Nikon) digital camera, the sensor is what is called a 'Bayer array' and has a fundamental shortcoming: each sensor only recognizes one of the three primary colors (red, green, or blue). For example, in a 20 megapixel Bayer array, there are typically 10 million green sensors, 5 million red, and 5 million blue. Using a built in processor, each sensor element reports values for all three colors, by polling its neighbors and interpolating.The Sigma Foveon cameras are all based on the idea that the above is fundamentally fudging the result, and a truly accurate digital camera ought to be measuring all three primary colors at each sensor location. They use Foveon sensors, with three overlapping arrays, one for each primary color. This closely mimics the way color negative film was designed.My experience, having owned the Sigma SD9, SD14, and SD1, as well as each of the top line Canon DSLRs (including a 5D Mark II which I now use interchangeably with the SD1), and multiple large and medium format cameras over decades, is as follows:Pros: There is an almost ineffable 'you are there' quality to SD1 images, more obvious to some than others. Much more tonal subtlety and detail because of the accuracy of the values at each sensor location. Much less need for sharpening, because of both the multiple sensor arrays, and the lack of need for an AA (\"antialising\" or \"blurring\") filter, which is required for Bayer array cameras. In resolution tests, the SD1 meets or even exceeds Nyquist theoretical resolution limits, not surprising. At its best this yields results that many of us find truly exciting. It requires the use of Sigma lenses, the best of which are extremely good and fully competitive with Canikon lenses, though perhaps not as rugged. This IS when used properly a 'poor man's medium format DSLR' and even an excellent substitute for the very cumbersome use of large format for landscape.Cons: Like previous Sigma DSLRs, extraordinarily slow. Suitable only for RAW capture, and not supported yet by Adobe Camera Raw so you must use Sigma's improved but still very slow Sigma Photo Pro software. Lacking in dynamic range. Very noisy at higher ISO (perhaps 800 and above). Absolutely not suited to be your only all-purpose DSLR unless you work slowly and do exclusively landscape or still life. A very eccentric camera that requires a lot of patience and technical expertise.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Foveon performance at its best!", "Author": "Phbug", "ReviewID": "R2GR88JXREC6J9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The ultimate Foveon-based digital SLR, loaded with features and of an excellent build quality.

Mccartney", "ReviewID": "R32VNO6DIX1CJN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a photographer and retoucher who has had to retouch the raw files from this camera I've developed a few points I would love to discuss with sigma.  First of all I'm a huge fan of this camera, but working with the files from it I quickly decided I will never buy it due to some glaring issues....  I hope sigma reads these reviews because this is what I want them to see.Dear Sigma,  I want to buy your camera.  I want it bad, its resolving power is amazing and I love its color, but I won't touch this camera until it is supported by third party raw software.  Other manufacturers work with third party developers, I think you should too..... because your Photo Pro software is completely unusable.  And stop claiming these cameras have triple the megapixels they actually do.  Yes, I agree they have 3 times the resolving power, but they simply don't have those pixels in the final image.  I understand you think this doesn't make a difference...... but it does..... stop it.  Make a sensor that's at least 25 honest megapixel, 30 would be preferred, and spend some time making sure it's not the worst high iso performer anywhere on the market.  And this is a minor gripe, but it would be nice to have this sensor at full frame.  It's a shame that a direct image sensor isn't being made with large photosites that can really show what a direct image sensor can do.  Believe it or not a dynamic range of 5 stops just isn't enough anymore.  If you fix these things I guarantee you I will buy one immediately, but until then I'm going to stick to a camera that makes sense for a professional.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I wanted to like it", "Author": "Surrounded", "ReviewID": "R1U6S09PAU2PAY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this camera.  I find the idea behind the Foveon sensor appealing.  Most cameras use a Bayer sensor, with the individual pixels laid out like a checkerboard - every alternate one green, with the remainder divided equally between red and blue.  Since each pixel detects only one color, the software interpolates the other colors from adjacent pixels.  The Foveon, on the other hand, has all three colors at each pixel location.  So technically, this camera isn't really 46 megapixels - it's 15.3 megapixels.  The Bayer sensor is something that sounds terrible in theory, but in practice, it works pretty well.  Although Sigma fans will insist that the Foveon produces more accurate color rendition, a decent, modern Bayer sensor will have almost identical performance.  I checked the Foveon website (Foveon is now wholly owned by Sigma), expecting their sensors to be used in high-end cameras like Hasselblad or Leica.  However, except for what looks like an industrial application (the link was broken), Foveons are only used in Sigma cameras.  The one in the SD1 Merrill wasn't even listed.  That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with Foveons, but the fact that no other camera company feels the need to use them speaks highly of the Bayer sensor.I also like the Sigma's infrared filter, which doubles as a dust protector.  Most DSLRs risk letting dust get onto the sensor whenever the lens is changed.  Sigma's solution is so simple, I can't figure out why no one else has copied it, especially on the new mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras where there isn't anything at all between the sensor and the outside environment when the lens is off.  This setup also makes infrared photography so easy that anyone with a Sigma would be missing out if they didn't try it at least once.  Digital sensors automatically detect infrared light, and require filters to block it, but the typical setup doesn't allow them to be removed easily.  But removing the filter on a Sigma and replacing it with a visible light filter is only slightly more involved than changing a lens filter.  For someone doing a lot of infrared photography, it's almost worth getting a Sigma just for this.These features, unfortunately, don't make up for the many problems with the Sigma.  The LCD screen is easily the worst of cameras in its class, but then, you're supposed to be looking through the viewfinder, anyway.  Also, the whole point of a DSLR, aside from the interchangeable lenses, is having knobs to adjust shutter speed, aperture, ISO, and white balance quickly, instead of having to root through menus to find what you want.  With knobs, you don't have to take your eye away from the viewfinder, once you learn to make adjustments by feel.  In addition, whether it's a limitation of the Foveon sensor or something else, Sigmas need a lot of light.  Above 400 ISO, quality suffers, but low light performance is supposed to be another advantage DSLRs have over point and shoot cameras.The main problem is that it only takes the Sigma lenses that are made to fit Sigma cameras.  Although Sigma is one of the largest aftermarket lens makers, if they ever decide to stop making DSLRs, you're going to have a bunch of lenses that won't fit anything else.  Supposedly, Pentax lenses fit Sigmas, but I'm not sure if it works the other way around, and even if it did, the range of Canon and Nikon cameras and lenses is really the only choice for anyone who isn't planning on keeping the same camera for the rest of their life.  DSLRs are notorious for becoming obsolete almost as soon as you buy one, but once you've collected the lenses you want, it's not a huge investment to just upgrade the camera body.  With Sigma, you run the risk of ending up with an orphan.My suggestion for Sigma is to take the plunge and come out with a full frame, mirrorless model.  In the days of film, the only option for being able to see exactly what was going to go onto the film was a SLR.  The LCD screen renders the complexity of the mirror and pentaprism unnecessary, except for occasions when extremely precise focus control is required.  A mechanical shutter is also unnecessary since the sensor can be activated electronically to far surpass anything a mechanical shutter is capable of.  However, most mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras seem to be aimed at the amateur market, probably because professionals are still wedded to the mirror and pentaprism setup that is a holdover from the film era.  Canon or Nikon isn't going to sabotage their own product line by releasing a high-end mirrorless camera that neither professionals nor amateurs will want, but Sigma could.  It would also be a great opportunity for them to introduce a full frame sensor.  I would suggest dropping down to 30 megapixels, about halfway between the Merrill and the 14 megapixel SD15.  14 megapixels on a Foveon is really 4.6, not quite enough today.  6 megapixels is probably the lowest number a modern camera could get away with, and for what most people use digital cameras for, 10 megapixels (translating to 30 on a Foveon) is plenty.  That may seem abysmally low in this day of the megapixel wars, where a manufacturer can simply cram more pixels onto the same size sensor and fool everyone into thinking they've accomplished a significant upgrade.  The advantage of a 30 megapixel full-frame Foveon would be larger pixels and better low light sensitivity.  And it should have knobs to adjust  everything.Of course, this isn't going to happen - Sigma will either stuff yet more pixels onto the same size sensor, or more likely, will drop its DSLR line to concentrate on point and shoots.  Or, they will give up on camera bodies altogether and limit themselves to lenses.  So the Sigma camera is a destined to remain an oddity, its main appeal being to those who want an alternative to Canon and Nikon, at a higher price, with lower performance, and less versatility.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great resolution at low ISO...not great color", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R2YHF261T9DH5U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you are willing to put up with converting raw files in the supplied software, then you will get incredible resolution as long as you don't go past ISO 200. So shooting hand held is really only possible in very good light. You can get a lot of punch out of the color too, but only if you use the mind-numbing Sigma Photo Pro 5 software. Jpg's have a strange color matrix applied to them. Not standard at all....they do not look real. Sigma Photo Pro 5 is so slow you'll only want to correct a couple of things (e.g. white balance) and then export as .tiff and use Lightroom or some other mainstream post processing product.For what you pay, and the inability to use mainstream software, the the requirement to use Sigma lenses, I am not sure I would recommend this camera, even given its current price point.
