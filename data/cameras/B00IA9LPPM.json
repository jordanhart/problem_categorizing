{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Buy this for the zoom!", "Author": "Jimmy the meek", "ReviewID": "RRV8GGSNYXX0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was a Canon guy for years until I purchased my first Nikon last year with their P510.  Excellent camera with a 42x zoom.  So when they released the P600, I decided to go for the extra zoom reach and the addition of WiFi.  All things considered, I'm glad I went for the upgrade with one small reservation.  The WiFi really does work well for transferring photos from my P600 to my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone, but the Nikon app you have to install on the phone is spotty at times.  Not often, but it periodically loses connection to the camera WiFi meaning you have to back into the menu of both the phone and the app and reconnect.  Furthermore, I found a much easier way to transfer photos from my camera to my phone with this device: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CYARTL2/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1 .  You simply plug it into the phone and take the sd card from the camera and plug it into the device.  The camera recognizes it as a USB drive and you can just upload the photos you want.  This is especially useful when I want to upload photos from a sporting event or concert to Facebook right on the spot.  They make those card readers for most of today's popular cell phones.As for the camera itself, I find it does just about everything well for a non DSLR camera that can cost much more.  The zoom, both optical and digitized, work extremely well and produce fantastic pictures with the image stabilizer on.  The addition of \"bird watching\" and \"moon\" modes just add to the many pre loaded settings that are already in place.  Manual focus is another good thing to have on this camera, and the subject of the reason I felt I had to take a star away.At times (as with most non DSLR's), the auto focus just can't focus in certain situations.  When I received this camera a few weeks ago, I almost returned it because I was trying to take an indoor picture of something with the zoom about halfway extended.  Not only did the camera take a long time to try to focus, but when it did \"lock\" to take the pic, it was way out of focus.  So I got out my P510 to try to get the photo in the same situation, and it did the same thing.  Unlike a DSLR, there are times when these cameras with a motorized auto focus won't focus unless you change the situation.  In my case, I just zoomed back out and got closer to the subject and it took a perfect pic.  It's just a matter of getting to know the camera. The manual focus does help at times, but if you're trying to take a pic on the spot like a pet or a group photo when people say \"cheese\", it can be annoying.  If this is an issue and you take a lot of indoor pics where you're zooming in and out a lot, you may want to consider a DSLR.To sum it up, I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for the best super zoom camera out there right now.  Nice, sharp pics at the far end of the zoom ... even handheld without a tripod.  The WiFi, in my opinion, is just an expensive option that may not be really necessary for most.  In fact, the only situation it may be useful is if you're somewhere with a bunch of people who all have phones with the Nikon app loaded and you want to share your pics with them wireless.  For general camera use, this camera takes very good pics both indoor and out, but the truth is there are other less expensive cameras out there in this class without the zoom or WiFi that take just as good pics in general situations (my P510 without any zoom takes identical pics to my P600).So as my title says, if you're going to buy this, buy it for the zoom!", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT !!!", "Author": "K.

I know many of you can guess who that retailer is.I was eager to get my hands on this camera because the zoom is much cheaper than a super zoom for my Sony SLT would be and the camera covers the focal points that it would take many lenses for either my NEX or the SLT to cover. The cons of the Nikon outweigh the pros though and I'm sure Nikon could of done better with this model. I list the pros and cons below in numbered bullets:Pros1. The zoom is great and long.2.Macro, or up close is good.3. Video is good.4. Overall the menu,  scene selections. and overall layout of camera functions are pretty good.Cons1. Lack of RAW capture in a list price camera of 499.99, so a big mistake there in my opinion.2. Shooting at  7 frames per seconds is a tedious wait for the photos to write to the card. I tried many cards results were always the same.3. No hot shoe for a flash or a microphone.4. Many of my shots in low light were soft, so RAW would of helped there.5. The focus in low light wasn't good either, however, it was ok.6. The zoom although the range was great seemed slow to me. I also heard some of the posters on the wireless feature not being what they expected, but it function fine with my tablet Overall in my opinion Nikon dropped the ball on this camera, but I still find myself wondering why?

You  definitely need to look and read the booklet.  Its also about the exploration of the menus and selections of M,P, A, scene, effects, and the icons for other settings. I love the 60X zoom.  One thing I have read, that did not have the greatest reviews was the WiFi connection.

I am absolutely blown away by the advances in the optics and electronics since my last Nikon, a P90, which is about 5 years old.

Also, the improved image stabilization makes and it's possible to hand-hold the camera at high zoom.

There were a few things that concerned me before I bought it, but I didn't see any one of them being a show-stopper. Using the Nikon P600 made me rethink my concerns and I discovered a couple other issues that were show-stoppers, at least for me.Concerns before I purchased it:No way to add any accessories to this device, not even a lens filter for protection and no lens hood option.No RAW format.Concerns after I purchased the Nikon P600:No lens filter available at all:The first day I took the camera out for some shooting, it started drizzling. It made me realize just how many times I clean my old camera's lens filter every day I use it. A lot! Dust, rain, whatever, I am always striving to keep it clean. I thought about the fact that I have no way to protect the lens of the Nikon (except a lens cap, of course) and every time I cleaned it I introduced the chance of a scratch or worse.No lens hood available at all:It didn't take too many shots with the Nikon P600 before I realized that I was seeing some of the same kind of wash-out in some shots that my wife gets with her Canon SX30 with the same kind of sunny sky shots. I take the same shots with my Panasonic FZ-100 (with a lens hood) and I get no wash-out at all.No RAW format:I didn't know if I would miss RAW or not, although for the past year I have been shooting nothing but RAW with my Panasonic FZ-100. But I realized right away that I did miss it. Knowing that with the jpegs, any editing I do causes some loss of data started to bug me some. Why Nikon doesn't do RAW is beyond me!Showstoppers:1. The LCD display on the Nikon P600 works beautifully indoors or in the shade, but try looking at a shot in full or very bright sunlight and the screen washes out so bad there were times I couldn't tell if my shot was in focus or not! That got irritating very fast!2. The zoom. Yes, I know, the zoom - the very thing that makes this camera so attractive also was, for me at least, a major issue. When it works it is amazing, really. You can take a photo of an object that is so far away! Unfortunately, the zoom would shift into and out of focus all the time! Not just at the distance shots either. Most often I would be forced to press the shutter half-way to get it to focus at all. I know this action is supposed to \"lock in\" the focus, but neither my wife's Canon nor my Panasonic make you do this to get any focus at all. And what was really irritating was that this happened with video all the time, too! It made video shooting a pain.So, when I added up all of the issues above, I came to the conclusion this camera was not for me, so I returned it today. I'm going to now wait for the Canon SX60 to come out. In the meantime, I'll stick with my old and trusty Panasonic FZ-100 which still takes great photos, even though it can't zoom as far as the Nikon could.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than my Coolpix P510  But very Slow.", "Author": "Chuck", "ReviewID": "R1KB9974T1WCQQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been waiting for the cameras with the 60X zooms to come out, since I like taking pictures of birds, and have tried the Canon SH50 60X , the Panasonic with its 60X, but sent both of them back.

Camera likes to randomly hang, needing to remove battery some of the times. It has done this 3 times in less than 1 week of usage since I got it from Costco.
