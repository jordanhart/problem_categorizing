{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Quality and performance", "Author": "J.CAS - \"Do Right and Fear No Man\"", "ReviewID": "R16IS0VC51ZQRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera (EX-Z1050) four months ago to replace a Canon Power Shot, which I loved. I debated about the 7mp versus the 10mp for a while, because the size of the 10mp was about twice as thick. I went to a retail store to play with them and ultimately chose the 10mp model. Here's what I found out after over 3000 pictures and videos (I'm a big picture guy with a toddler around)-SUPER FAST STARTUP - about one secondAMAZING BATTERY LIFE - this camera exceeded all my expectations in this category. In fact I am still amazed by it. I do not take very many flash pictures, but I take a lot of video. I get about 800 pictures or 1 hour 20 minutes of continuous video before it dies.SDHC FORMAT - this camera does not take regular SD cards, so you need an SDHC card for it. It is a completely different architecture than SD, but the capacity is huge, starting at 4GB. This new format does not work in regular SD card readers, so I bought a $13 SDHC card reader because I hate messing around with camera cables.EXCELLENT VIDEO - This camera has the same video quality and frames per second as my $1200 JVC Everio GZ-MC200. The videos are taken in MPEG 4 and there is no need to convert the files, so they can be opened and played in standard windows media player.EASY CONTROLS - Well designed controls and easy user interfaceFAST - This camera is ready for another shot in ONE second and has a multiple shot mode that takes about 5 shots per second. Turning off or lowering the review mode will get you up and running even faster after a shot.GREAT LCD - Great 2.7\" screen, very bright in direct sunlight. I have it on highest brightness/ contrast and the battery life is still amazing.BEST SHOT MODES - Very convenient, I did not think I would ever use these, but I find myself always using them. These modes automatically adjust the white balance and color saturation for a given situation like Portrait, Bright Sun, Fluorescent, ETC. They are very easy to select and use and work well.PHOTO SOFTWARE STINKS - The included photo software \"hot photo\" stinks. It loads into your tray, is always running in the background and sucks up your system resources. The usability is poor at best and any other photo software would be better. You do not need this software to use the camera.IMAGE STABILIZATION - In my opinion the camera takes better photos with image stabilization off. I noticed a lot of noise in the blacks under high zoom in Photoshop when I had the Image Stabilization on. I took two sample shots from tripod with timer one with and one without to confirm my initial noise observation. It seems that noise and pixelization are apparent with Stabilization, but very clear sharp pictures without it. Bottom line is there is no substitute for a steady hand, so practice with the camera.BOTTOM LINE - Get this camera. It's cheap for about $200 and with an 8 GB HDSC card, card reader and case plus tax; you will get away with the whole package for about $300 bucks. Image quality is super in a very compact and user friendly package.", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera -- Better than my Exilim EX-Z750", "Author": "Alan", "ReviewID": "R2CUCNR3TTY0Y3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my Exilim EX-750 fell in the cooler, it was over.  I loved that camera, but couldn't bring myself to get a refurbished one for almost the price of what I paid 15 months prior.  So, I \"upgraded\" to the Exilim EX-Z1050. It's even easier to user than the Z-750. Changing the most used settings is very quick. The LCD is bright outdoors, so even though there is no tiny viewfinder it's not a problem.

My wife used last years model.  My conclusion is that the EX-Z1050 is markedly easier to use in terms of access to menu as well as larger space for framing the picture.  Interestingly, however, the images on my wife's camera were clearly superior to this EX-Z1050.  I suspect that to hold the price down Casio downgraded the quality of the lens.  Since anti-shake feature will marginally degrade the quality of the image I double checked and both our cameras had the feature turned on.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!!", "Author": "TexWesty \"TexWesty\"", "ReviewID": "RU8J92QW4U2MT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After extensive research and comparisons against other similar cameras by other manufacturers, I bought this camera for adventure and as a takealong when it is not practical to take my Digital SLR.  I am extremely impressed with the quality of the images and the ease of use of the interface.  Compared against the top-of-the-line Elph models, I decided on the Casio because it was easier to hold and operate, was an excellent price for 10.1MP, a decent zoom range created a great feature package.  Also, the picture modes give 30 or so options that make up for the lack of manual features (how can you use those anyways with a point and shoot?).  Recently, on a trip to the Grand Canyon, wide angle shots of the scenery were as spectacular as close-ups!!  (Of course, my skill in composition didn't hurt either :-))  Also, one other important thing, the shutter speed  is quicker than the other cameras that I tested so you don't end up with blurred or missed shots when an animal, friends, or 8 month olds decide to move around!

Plus - the shutter response time is much quicker than the z1000. You can choose from 7 different picture sizes/pixelation. up to 10 megapixels!The Video camera is pretty sweet, too -- You can zoom in and out during filming.One neat features is the Audio Recording - like a little pocket tape-recorder. The only thing is, my computer doesn't automatically detect the audio files when transferring -- I have to go in and manually select them.

The EXZ1050 is small and compact.  It fits easily in the palm of your hand or in a front pants pocket.The LCD screen is huge and all the settings are easy to see and understand.  The button labeled \"BS\" is for \"Best Shot.\"  The battery lasts forever.  It has dozens of settings or you can just shoot pictures in the PhD (push here dummy) mode.  The pictures are sharp, and the color rendition is accurate.  I was pleased with the quality of the video.The camera comes with a built-in memory of about 20 MB, enough for about 20 small pictures or a video less than ten seconds long.  I bought a 2 GIG memory card for $25. Buy a case for the camera.  My cat knocked the camera in its case from a shelf four feet high to the floor...no harm done.Don't install the CD.

Lue \"Kent\"", "ReviewID": "R3K4B836X7FC5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned the Casio Exilim EX-Z1050 for two months and this is my third digital camera, not including cell phone and PDAs.  My observations are as follows:1)  You get much more value for your money than buying the familiar camera names like Kodak, Canon, Nikon, Pentax, etc.2)  The start-up time is very quick (about 1 second) so you don't lose any precious shots.3)  The flash recycle time is very quick so you can take instant follow-up shots.4)  This camera is capable of taking 7 shots per second so it's great for action shots. I also took pictures from a moving vehicle and the pics were quite clear.5)  Takes a SD memory card so you can easily store 1,000s of pictures.6)  I took this camera to Hawaii for 8 days in August and took over two hundred pictures, some using the flash.  I never needed to recharge the battery.7)  You can also take videos!8)  This casio is tiny!  Very easy to put in your pocket.  Don't waste any money on a case since it will only make it bulkier.9)  The controls are very logical and easy to learn.  I didn't even need to read the manual to figure out how things work.10)  The only thing I did not really like about this Casio is that I have to remove the battery to charge it.  You cannot charge the battery by simply plugging a cord into the camera.  Not a big deal, but it would have been nice!11)  I compared this camera to many others before buying and this Casio was easily the best value and most features for the price.Bottom line:  Buy it!

This can be annoying when most of your pictures are with people already looking away assuming you had already taken the pictures.  However, w/ Exilim EX-Z1050, this is not a problem.  We have an 18 month old daugther that is always on the move, so we literally have split seconds to capture the shots we want.  EX-Z1050 allows us to do so with ease.Great value especially for the 10.1MP camera.  Hightly recommended.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Casio skimped on workmanship & quality!  Stick with the EX-Z1000.", "Author": "A. R. Ortiz \"Meow!\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q27194D4PIE5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have never written a review before but I felt so compelled to warn everybody about this camera as compared to it's predecessor the EX-Z1000.  They are essentially the exact same camera but with 2 very key differences.  The first difference is that the EX-Z1000 is an all metal encased camera.  This was one of Casio's key advantages over it's competitors.  I was severely disappointed to find that the EX-Z1050 is all plastic with the exception of a narrow metal band around the frame.  I guess Casio decided it would be cheaper to make the camera out of plastic, but I'd rather pay a few more dollars for the solid feel of the metal camera.  The weight difference is totally negligible too.The second key difference is in the LCD monitor.  The EX-Z1050 has a slighly smaller screen which is not the biggest deal, BUT...and this is a BIG BUT...they've chopped the screen resolution in half!!!  I compared the two models side by side and there's NO COMPARISON.  It's like the difference between a projector TV and a high definition TV.  The images always seem blury on the EX-Z1050's LCD.  With the EX-Z1000 you can tell whether or not your photo is in focus without having to take a 2nd snapshot.Don't get me wrong, the EX-Z1050 still a great camera, but get your hands on the previous EX-Z1000 model while you still can.  You may have to pay a few extra bucks, but that's because all the pro-sellers know the EX-Z1000 is the better quality model.  All I can say is that I hope Casio goes back to the high standards exhibited by their earlier models.", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good point and shoot", "Author": "W. A.

It is compact and the best shot function is neat but useless in my book, particularly b/c in night shot mode, all my shots were either dark, blurry, or grainy...so it didn't make much of a difference.

However, the quality of the pics & video is excellent, seeing as it's coming from such a small package.The only reason this is 4 and not 5 stars, is because of the inability to set advanced settings for each shot.  You have to select pre-set modes (like \"Party\", \"Sports\", or \"Scenic\") to get the right shutter speed or light sensitivity that you want.

I found that and more in the Casio EX-Z1050.First of all, it is a 10.1 megapixel camera. It takes great pictures. Secondly, it's small enough to fit in my pocket, so I don't have to haul around a big camera. I always just stick it in my pocket when I go out, so I never miss a photo op. Third, the battery lasts long, and it comes with a charger so you can recharge it. No more buying hundreds of AA batteries for your camera. I'm actually quite impressed with how long it lasts, I can usually fill up my memory card before it runs out.It's not fragile, either. I mean, of course you want to be careful with any electronics, but you'd be surprised at how much this little camera can take. It accidentally fell out of my sweatshirt pocket onto concrete one time, and it barely had a few scratches on it. It has also been dropped in the snow, and no harm was done after wiping it off. I'd recommend taking a bit better care of your new camera, but at least you know it's somewhat sturdy.Overall, it's the perfect camera for me, and I will be using it for years to come. It's not too hard to figure out, so I'd recommend it for just about anyone.", "Date": "December 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Small in size but big features", "Author": "S.

The only negative thing I would point out about this camera, is that it does not have an eyepiece for viewing.  You use the screen to view, and at times, the sun's glare makes it almost impossible to see what you are shooting.  Practice before you go on vacation taking pictures.

(The outward appearance is very stylish and smart looking)It has a large screen.It takes decent movies.The rechargeable battery is pretty easy to recharge.Cons:The pictures are blurry.  My husband and I have both messed with the settings constantly to try to make the pictures not blurry.  With a tripod, this camera works fine, but almost anytime you are holding it they turn out blurry.The manual doesn't tell you anything about this camera... NOTHING.Auto shake on/off doesn't work (...again blurry pictures)I can't even figure out (and believe me I have tried) to adjust aperture or shutter speed.  The only thing it lets me change is ISO.  Lame.There is delay between when you press the button and the camera takes the picture. (Fine for nature photography, but really bad for people or pets)All in all this camera is o.k. Like i said before, I have owned it for a long time and it is still working, so that is good. I take good care of it, and it seems to be alright.  One of the reasons I bought it in the first place was because I saw that it had 10.1 mega pixels, but so you don't make the same mistake I made, it turns out that that just basically means it takes very, very large poster size pictures. (You can change the setting to take smaller ones, though) The quality isn't any better because of it.  I thought 10.1 mega pixels = better pictures. Nope.(Unless you plan on blowing all your pictures up to an enormous size.)Overall, I would not recommend this camera to family and friends.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "An Excellent (Exilim) Camera", "Author": "George Raiter", "ReviewID": "R84UJ7R63JOII", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For its price, this is a OK camera. What brings my rating up is the huge selection of shooting modes, the video editing, the audio, and several other features.  First off: The shooting modes.  This camera is a classic Casio in that it has many shooting modes (Best Shot).  It has a setting for low light (candles), for fireworks, for flowers (close-up/macro), for pets, for portraits, for eBay, and many other things.  The video editing is an innovative feature that allows you to cut the middle, beginning or end of ANY video more than about 5 seconds long.  The audio clips are also a great thing to have (although I can't compare this to other cameras).  Other good things are high-speed shutter mode that allows you to hold down the button to take several pictures per second; this lets you get the perfect picture of a basketball dunk or of your pet.  The camera can also record a clip of sound to accompany a picture when you look at it.  Additionally, you can zoom in 8x (without getting grainy) on any picture you have taken.  It also, of course, has a timer so you can include everyone in the picture.  The only thing I think this camera is missing is the ability to hold the shutter open to take pictures of cars' lights as they move.  Lastly, I would think twice before purchasing this particular camera, as Casio recently came out with a camera that functions the same and has 10.1 MP, but is half as thick (and has a youtube shooting mode).", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!!!

I'm a very casual picture take and have probably taken less than 1,000 pictures total during the life of the camera. I am very careful with this camera (as with all electronics) and it is majorly babied. It has never been dropped, exposed to water, nothing. I have an excellent case with full padding for it.It takes great pictures outside. Inside is a different matter--they often turn out blurry and fuzzy no matter what you do. They tend to over or under exposure which is super frustrating. The setting for auto flash is awful--over exposure all the time.

SanDisk and other decent brands (in other words not cheap crappy ones). I did buy an extended warranty and I'm hopeful they will fix it. But I'm very unhappy with the fact that this happened.

The camera this replaced was an old Kodak that was over 10 years old and still worked fine (but it was not digital). Lame. Severely lame.You know I decided I could live with the blurry pic's (maybe due to the time lag between when you press and when it actually takes the pic which is much longer than other cameras) inside so I mostly use it outside but now I can't even take any pic's as the internal memory holds 2 photo's.

BLUME \"huck capone\"", "ReviewID": "RA4AE7GQ0ZJL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is very compact & takes very nice snapshots but has a few problems. The camera takes SD & SDHC memory cards. If you are going to shoot at 10 megapixels or near that so you can have high quality when cropping or blowing up images to a very large size (11 X 14 to poster size) you'll probably want to get a 4 or 8 gig SDHC card to use with this camera. Amazon has an 8 gig SDHC card on sale for less than 50 bucks right now (search for it)... The only way to frame the shots with this camera is by utilizing the large LCD screen on the rear of the camera. Unfortunately it is not as clear & sharp as other casio LCD screens though it's ok for most purposes. It also has a tendency to washout on a sunny day making it hard to see & frame a picture. For a better, sharper, clearer LCD screen you can see in bright daylight get the newer, slimmer, slightly lighter 10 mp Casio EX - S10 for around two hundred twenty five bucks. If you want to shoot fairly high quality video you won't get it with this model. This model shots .avi video ar 24 frames per second which looks blurry & somewhat choppy. The newer slimmer Casio's including the EX-S10 will shoot higher quality mp4 video at 30 fps. At the ultra high quality video setting the video looks really nice even to watch on a TV monitor or transfer to DVD using Nero Vision or similar. You can leave your larger digital video camera home except for super special occasions! The newer models also allow the higher quality video to be shot in widescreen if you prefer that look or for widescreen monitors! The newer models like the EX-S10 also have a seprate YouTube video mode so you can shoot small vids tailored to upload to YouTube quickly & easily! This camera also has a very small weak flash which is great for taking most snapshot length photos indoors but nothing further. It has a great battery life but so do all the compact Casio's including the slimmer, newer ones. For the reasons outlined do not make the mistake I made & get this model Casio if you want an ultra compact camera. Get instead the Casio  EX -S10 which is slimmer, lighter, has a better viewfinder & takes higher quality video at Ultra High Quality mode & has a special YouTube video mode if you want to post vids on YouTube quickly & easily for around $225.00...", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Pocket/Purse camera", "Author": "T.

The pictures that were taken during the day were GREAT!!  The pictures taken at night using the best shot feature were TERRIBLE!!  The night pictures were very blurry.  I took it in to a camera shop in Vegas and they told me to disregard the best shot feature and use the standard setting.  This helped reduce the blurriness, but took away from the color of the photo.  This camera is useless to me!  I will be returning it!
