{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bottom line:  Reasonably priced Canon camera, but not perfect", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R246P9AJJ1C83M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided on the Canon A495 as I wanted an inexpensive camera to carry around in my bag for unexpected shots. For those of you who want a good basic camera from a well-known camera company, this one should fit your needs well.Are you trying to decide between the A495 and the next model lower, the A490?  Here are the differences:\u00b7 The A495 has a Face Self-Timer feature.  You can focus on a group of people, and before the camera takes the shot, run over and get into the picture yourself, with your face being detected, too.  Of course, you would also need a tripod or a place to set the camera down.\u00b7 The A495 has two (2) additional Scene Modes:  Poster Effect and Super Vivid Color.  Nice to have the additional scenes, but how often will you use them?  I plan on making some art for my living room walls with the Poster Effect scene, so I opted for the A495.\u00b7 The A495 will focus on up to 9 faces (or areas); whereas the A490 will focus on up to 5 faces (or areas).I would have given this camera 5 stars if it wasn't so darn slow on the recycling time after taking a photo.  It flashes \"busy\" on the LCD screen and it is frustrating when you are waiting to take another shot.NOTE #1:  This camera does not come with an SD card, so pick one up when buying the camera as you will not be able to use it right out of the box otherwise.  This camera will accept SDHC cards up to/including 32 GB.NOTE #2:  The PSC-500 genuine Canon case Canon PSC-500 Deluxe Soft Case fits this camera perfectly, but there is no extra room for spare batteries.  It's a snug fit, but it's well padded too.NOTE #3: For those of you looking for a camera that can put a date stamp on your pictures, this one does. You have your choice of date only or date and time - or none at all.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good value, that takes great pictures", "Author": "CAMPJEEP", "ReviewID": "R1N67OMZOHLZ8D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Simple, easy to use, feels good in the hands and it does take great pictures. A great choice for a first digital camera.It's the perfect camera to have if you're on a budget but want to capture great quality pictures.  A 2.5 sec delay between shots with out the flash, ( with the flash on the avg is around. 3 TO 6 secs ),  and start up time is 1.6  sec. *The camera does not have optical image stabilization.*No memory card included with this camera*. I use a 2gig san disk sd card ultra II(you do not get one with the camera)  that gives you about 750 pictures. I use 2 AA energizer (lithium batterys)(or 2650-2900 mAH rechargables) and that gets about 500-550 pictures .  You would not be happy with just standerd AA battery life.Walmarts, Meijers stores have a 8 pack of AA energizer lithium batterys for about $16.80,they seem to last for ever. I just use these like for vacation or a hloidays, for just every day shooting I use (good) rechargeables. The AA batterys are probably the reason the LCD screen  takes so long to recharge after the flash goes off (and to take the next picture) even with the good batterys it is recharging the flash up to 8sec on a (full flash) recharge and the times that are stated above...I set the disp overlay to grid lines to help take a straighter picture, You may use it for the 1/3 rule also).Cons:  None for this price point.No camera is perfect  Some are having trouble with the shutter button trying to push it half way down trying to compose there picture, on this camera, you only have to touch the shutter button and the weight of your finger will do the trick, if you try to push it half way like the canon A480 or your old camera it will take the picture...  (Update)>  It seems to free up the more you use it but still not like the cameras before it... Other Thoughts:* The A495 takes great pictures but you will not be able to tell it by the low resolution lcd screen, you will have to wait and look at them on the computer to realy see how good they are. It is sometimes hard to compose your shot in very bright sun light also.* I just realy like the colors in the pictures that the canon cameras produce, again thats just me thinking out loud. I know this all sounds bad but for the price this camera does take great pictures and is easy and fun to use.It is on par for this price point.I have bought these for my 4 and 6 year old grand kids ( The canon A 480s) and have had no trouble for a year now.The next step up is a canon SD 1300 that I know anything about  and you can get a upgrade on this stuff if you just can't live with the A495 (I have never used a A3100)so I can not speak for it. I am no expert and I am trying to be honest here and help out if I can, these are just my thoughts, look at some of the pictures that I and others have posted on this site if that would be helpfull and  check out the other reviews on the A495 and good luck on your next camera. I have these cameras (SD 1300,A480 A 495) I really like them.I mostly take pictures of bear in the Smokey Mountians (CADES COVE) and love chaseing the grand kids around taking their pictures.

AA battery life (definitely bring backup batteries- or better yet, rechargables)2. (another person mentioned in another review) flash recovery takes a few seconds- that could mean the difference between a decent pic and a blurry mess. although it goes without saying that this is a problem in almost ALL compact digital cameras.3. no view finder (i'm reaching here- this has never been a concern of mine, yet some people absolutely NEED one).", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "picture going out of focus", "Author": "slg", "ReviewID": "R3AAH2TEA0S3GV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera from reviews and the good price.

I wanted a small camera that is easy to carry around.  It has the same lens as the Canon A480 & a well known British camera magazine gave that camera a rating of 93%, mainly because of its excellent image quality.  And because I used to have a Canon A1000IS.They gave the A495 a rating of 86%, presumably because other brands had kinda caught up to Canon's level of performance and features.I would definitely recommend buying rechargeable Nimh batteries because the starter alkaline batteries only did 54 shots, 1 10 second video, & quite a lot of reviewing, looking at the menus etc,before the low battery warning popped up.  (It was a very cold day though around 10 degrees celsius.)I've only used the camera on full auto so far & the photos look beautiful to me.  At low iso settings they look just as good as many more expensive cameras I've owned.  (Before buying the A495 I had a Fuji S200 EXR which took superb photos but was too big & heavy for me.)Other comments:The battery & SD card compartment has a nicely designed plastic latch.  Sturdier than Canon A1000IS.Nicer to hold than Canon A3000ISLCD screen works quite well even in bright sun.  Looks far better than one budget Kodak model I looked at.Update:  Maybe I got an extra good lens, but the photos this little camera takes in full auto mode are amazing.  Slow shot to shot times but fine forlandscapes & people pix if they pose for you.

It was easy to use, took great macro and regular shots, and was just an overall wonderful camera!  That was until the batteries started going out after about taking 50 shots with it.  No flash was being used at all, it was only in macro mode.  And this happened repeatedly no matter what batteries I used.  I have at least 4 different sets of rechargeable AA's that I have used successfully with my other camera.  They would last forever in that one, but not in this camera!  You get about 50 shots and that's it.  Basically this makes this camera completely USELESS for me.  I have an online business that requires me to take many shots to weed out the best ones to use - and needless to say after going through 4 different sets of batteries within 15 minutes time after time has made me furious.

I use it for documenting reports. The macro is more convenient than a field copy machine for copying documents on low or high quality. Shoot, save, transfer to my lap top and I am good to go. It is small and easy to handle. My only complaint is that even with fresh batteries in the cold it seem to take a long time to recharge the flash even when there is no need for the flash. It needs to complete charging or it will not take the next picture. I have had 35mm Nikon cameras for years and had good service. I have had two Nikon Coolpixs, The last Coolpix lasted about a week. The manager of the local dealer at Wolf Camera (at Fox Valley Centre, in Aurora, Illinois), a national camera chain told me I did not know how to use the camera and they needed to send it to their service centre and in 6 to 8 weeks would let me know if they would exchange out the camera, if they decided it was not my fault. In the mean time I could purchase another camera. Since the previous camera lasted only about 6 months I decided to try a different make and maybe even consider a cheaper type of camera. My previous Cannon model died after being used for well over a year in rain, dirt, snow, and being dropped. It finally died from my falling on it while it was open and it still works just very noisy. I could not trust it not to die in the middle of a field inspection. I'm glad I got this one it is even better quality than the older model and cheaper. The old noisy one is now my backup. The other thing High on my requirements is generic batteries and memory, AA batteries and SD memory. I can not allow a priority accessories. I need to be able to pick-up accessories in the field in an emergency. PS: I told the camera store to keep the Nikon and I will not be back to pick it up.

So price to performance ratio is unbeatable. If you have to take low light pictures, use a tripod and some noise removal software.Coming back to the battery life. The reason why it gives poor battery life is this thing is not programmed to 'pause' focusing when not required. So as long as you have the lens open it keeps trying to focus onto something or the other. You will constantly hear the servo spinning and lens clicking as it tries to focus on what it 'thinks' you are looking at (even if you are not looking through the view finder). Once you realize this the fix is easy. After you have taken your pictures, put it in playback/preview mode.

It's a budget camera that takes sharp photos.This camera has very good macro capabilities, with or without flash. I find it useful to photograph things before taking them apart so I can, of course, reassemble them.I recommend ditching the AA alkaline batteries and getting Sanyo Eneloop rechargeables. They are one of the few brands that hold up to 80% of their charge during a year in storage. They power the camera much longer than alkalines do and out perform other rechargeable brands.On the down side, the camera's screen washes out in bright sunlight and makes it difficult at times to see what's in the viewfinder. It's also a bit bulky to fit in a pocket, but I probably wouldn't do that since I would be afraid of damaging it somehow. The wrist lanyard isn't adjustable, and I'm sometimes concerned it will slip off my wrist. I bought the optional Canon soft case.

I have had some three DSLRs (by the way two of them are made by Canon) and many more point and shoot cameras.  I expected to buy a camera that can provide a better picture quality and be within a similar price range as my 4-5 years old budget camera. After reading quite a few good reviews on various sites, I decided to purchase a Canon A495. Interestingly according to various reviews (as far as the picture quality is concerned), Canon A495 is supposed to outperform even cameras costing twice as much! What I can say is that the picture quality of Canon A495 does not measure up to my old Fuji F20.  I tested both cameras side by side under various lighting conditions (both indoors and outdoors) and at different zoom settings (as picture quality changes also according to zoom setting).  In all the cases, Fuji F20 outperformed Canon A495. In low lighting conditions, pictures taken by A495 were infested by chromatic noise (F20 is known for its low light capability and it did provide much cleaner pictures). However, even in perfect lighting conditions, Fuji F20 resolved details better than Canon A495 and its picture sharpness varied to a lesser extent from the image center to corners.  By the way, Fuji F20 has a 6 megapixel sensor.It is very possible that A495 is better than other higher megapixel mediocre budget point and shoot cameras around today (and perhaps that is why its ratings are good).

I was very happy when it came and immediately picked it up and started taking random snaps of stuff. It took me a moment to figure out how to shoot video, but I was very pleased with the video (and picture) quality and the resolution of the screen. I've had it since April 2011 and it's still going strong. Very good battery life and a nice amount of modes. A nice little camera for a kid who wants a non-confusing camera that he/she can take easy pics with. All in all a great little camera. P.S. I am 9 yrs old and used my dad's account to write this review.Edit Spring 2012: The camera is still living up to my expectations, especially since I started borrowing my dad's Gorillapod to shoot videos. I forgot to mention that the controls are very easy to use and just the right size. It is also very easy to look at pictures and adjust the zoom. This camera is very pretty too!P.S. The \"newer model\" is a completely different Canon camera.Update Jan 5, 2013. I am having a problems with it now.  Problem 1: The battery/SD card compartment no longer shuts right. I have had to tape it shut with electrical tape, which leaves black residue on the front of the camera. I think this was due to a 2-ft drop onto a hard (although carpeted) floor. Problem 2: Lens sometimes makes a funny sound when opening, zooming, and closing. Only a noise, though, nothing physical. Problem 3: This little guy is suddenly devouring batteries. I have to carry 2 or 3 pairs of AAs with me whenever I use the camera.And for those who want some tech specs: 640p video, 10MP photos. It can take almost 3000 photos with an empty 8GB SDHC card. From power-on to photos: 2-3 seconds. Zoom 3.3x optical, 13x digital.

Buying another one at only $79 makes a lot more sense than fixing the old one and the new one has easier to see controls on the back. Other than that, I think this unit is virtually identical to it's elder which cost about $110 in its day. I just tried the \"Vivid\" setting and it makes the pictures really pop with color (it only took me 2 years to discover it has this setting - I'll check the older one to see if it has it also).I use this camera primarily for a weekend mobile DJ service I run. I take about 100 pictures per event and display them on a big screen of the party goers. I even sell the pictures some times, so yes this does professional quality work. My only complaint is that it takes about 8 seconds for the flash to recharge (FYI - I use rechargable batteries that give me up to 200 flash shots). I love that it uses AA batteries because you never have to worry about lugging around a specialized charger (I just carry a spare pair of ready to go rechargables and a pair of \"real\" batteries for emergencies but I've never needed to open the emergency pack). Real handy, real small, and great pictures.I recently bought a much more expensive and fancier Canon D60 DSLR with an upgraded telephoto lens that cost me about $2000. This camera takes just about as good of pictures as the pro model (when shooting wide angle)and is much easier to carry around. I know some people say this is a cheap camera but if this thing were available a decade ago, you could have charged $1000 for it and people would have stood in line to buy it.

So I looked for a better one that might have come up on the market since last year.  After looking and looking we decided the best think would be just get the same one.  We ordered it and she ended up finding the old one.  She was so excited she jumped and screamed like a kid.  We returned the new ordered one and Amazon was very good at refunding, as always.Helena Bushroe", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "No rechargable battery", "Author": "Ahana Richards \"Ahana\"", "ReviewID": "RXM3619GNTBIK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think the camera is awesome, however, was sad to see that you need to use AA batteries often in order to use the camera.
