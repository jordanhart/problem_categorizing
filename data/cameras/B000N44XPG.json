{"Reviews": [{"Title": "P5000 First Impressions Very Good", "Author": "W. Creech \"Cheers, Bill\"", "ReviewID": "RBFK5FMRBQ619", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a small portable camera to complement my Nikon D70 and D80 DSLR. Small enough to fit in my pocket or on my belt, light enough to always have with me, yet have advanced capabilities and produce good quality photos when I did not have a DSLR with me.I have tried many cameras from Nikon and Canon. The P5000 has the right set of features and price to meet my needs. The Canon G7 does have some superior features, but is larger and weighs more so does not fit in my shirt pocket but OK in coat pocket, and is ~$100 more. I have had the P5000 for almost a week and it has been on my belt in the leather case every day. Very travel friendly. I also have the small light SB-400 iTTL Flash in my brief case to add more Flash capability and it is great.Picture quality is finally what has to be good. The P5000 produces very good IQ with that \"Nikon Color\" I am used to. I tested the P5000 in good lighting versus my Nikon D80, Nikon S7c and CoolPix 5400. The D80 wins hands down as the best quality. But the P5000 is much better that my other CoolPix. Plus going back and forth from the D80 to the P5000 was smooth due to button placement and similar shooting style. The hand grip on the P5000 is excellent for such a small camera too. I have posted my test pictures on another site if you look at Nikon Talk Forum on DPreview dot com and search for \"P5000 vs S7c vs 5400 First Impressions\"Cheers", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Impressed with this camera", "Author": "Darlene \"Darlene\"", "ReviewID": "RHS98OZQYI599", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my P5000 for less than a week and really am impressed with it.  The color is good, the photo quality is good.  For such a small camera, it has good ergonomics and most functions are easily accessed by by buttons or dials.  It has full manual controls and noise levels are very good for a 10 MP camera.  The VR stabilizing function works well.  It makes the perfect accompaniment to my D50 and D70 when I need a smaller purse or pocket-sized camera.", "Date": "April 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera but lots of motor noise...", "Author": "Andrea Church \"AC\"", "ReviewID": "R1THPDR9IIVH6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera to replace my well used Nikon Coolpix 7900. It takes fabulous photos and the multitude of manual controls is exceptional but what was Nikon thinking by having such a noisy autofocus motor in this camera? It makes a constant whirring sound--it's almost like you are using a camcorder instead of a still camera. There is no way to shut the sound off. I can hear it quite clearly even when just holding the camera in my hand. This issue is now being reported in the Nikon forums. It was a deal breaker for me. It was just too annoying and I returned the camera to the store. The sound is loud enough to record when using the the video setting so if you like to take videos alot you might want to read up what others have to say in regards to the noise issue. Otherwise, it's a first rate camera that takes photos almost the equivalent of my Nikon D50. What a shame that Nikon didn't address this issue before sending the camera out to customers.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "A VERY NICE CAMERA WITH ONE FATAL FLAW", "Author": "William M. Gibson", "ReviewID": "RQDEG9Q10MP85", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought and returned this camera.If I returned it, then why did I give it a respectable 4 rating?  Because in many (most) situations, it takes very nice pictures, it is small and stylish, it has full manual controls, it has a hotshoe for an external flash, it can accept different lenses, and it takes SD cards.Why did I return it?  Because it has one fatal flaw.  Despite being billed as the flagship point & shoot camera for Nikon, and despite the many cutting edge features, and despite the great qualities noted above, the auto focus is VERY SLOW.  It makes this camera almost unuseable if your subjects are moving kids, which is why I bought the camera.  I lost at least 1/2 the shots that I tried to take of my kids because I couldn't get them focussed.  If you read the various photography forums, there are several workarounds that help somewhat, but at the end of the day, the AF is still slow.If you don't plan on taking candid shots of your kids, then this could be a great camera for you.  I took several hundred wonderful pictures before I returned it.  Just not of my kids.By the way, I ended up buying a Fuji F31FD.  I won't go into great detail about the pros and cons of this camera (and it has both), but I'll just say I kept it and I like it.  The AF is much faster, and it has the added bonus of being one of the best (if not the best) low light cameras on the market today.", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great performance, price, & versatility", "Author": "J. Sharp", "ReviewID": "R1GNGUD4CTZKYH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this for a couple of days and love it! Its a great point and shoot, provides crisp, clear, beautiful images in auto mode. But, it also allows you an incredible amount of control and versatiltiy with the preset modes and the manual modes. You can get great results with \"art-ier\" shots that encorporate depth of field, saturation, etc.I've had great luck shooting in an indoor setting with natural light coming through the windows and lots of flourescent light coming from overhead when I've adjusting the white-point accordingly. It performs well in low-light situations too. I like the programmable function button that gives you a short-cut to the screen that pertains most to the situation you are shooting.The portability, image quality, add-on lenses, shoe for a speedlight flash, price, and proven Nikon quality, make this a great choice for someone looking for the most versatile small digital camera they can get.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Title":

For the basic P&S; user, it has too many options & controls and, in my opinion, the default settings are not optimal for good results. I had to change a number of settings to get satisfactory images. More experienced shooters will appreciate its many settings, options and tweaks for creative control. In this regard it is very versatile and sophisticated. It comes with a 114-page manual.I don't use the video feature so I am only addressing still photography.I've had mine for about two months, here's my summary:The good:Excellent picture quality at 10MPPriceLots of manual controlGood exposureHistogram picture review setting very helpfulIncludes white balance pre-set setting for tough lighting situationsGenerally well builtChoice of shooting modesLarge LCD monitor viewable from many anglesHas both optical viewfinder and LCDThe bad:Too small to hold comfortably, I'm always afraid I'll drop itPink streaks show on LCD when pointed at a light source (but not visible in the picture)Optical viewfinder framing is *VERY* inaccurateZooms too fast to be precise, needs finer zoom controlCould use a wider focal length on the short endBattery/memory door is flimsy, seems like it could break off easily---------------------As an example of picture quality, I shot a photo on the \"Normal\" setting, at ISO 400. I usually shoot in Fine, but for photos to be used on the web I prefer a smaller file size, and I had forgotten to reset it. Right off the card and unadjusted, I made a  9\" x 12\" print and it was tack-sharp with virtually no noise, easily rivaling a print made from 120 film. I'm impressed by that.Overall, I recommend the camera for the advanced P&S; user, but would tell a less experienced and casual photographer to get something simpler.----------------------Update 4/22/12: VideoHere is a video clip with the camera set for its best possible video quality (640x480 @ 30fps). You can judge the picture quality for yourself, the microphone is quite sensitive, but plagued with a very bad wind noise problem. In a more windy situation the wind is all you will hear.And here is another severe problem that will ruin a video. A quote from the manual: \"If the camera is pointed at the sun or other bright light source during recording, vertical comet-like streaks (\"smear\") may appear in the movie. Avoid pointing the camera at bright light sources while filming movies.\"", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Unique high end features, but slow focus performance", "Author": "Berkeley Tom", "ReviewID": "R1YSR0FJ3TXS9P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on finding a small point and shoot camera with the right set of features.

As an architect that travels a lot, it is important to have a reliable, good quality digital camera that has both easy automatic point-and-shoot capability, as well as manual control when needed.  The P5000 gives all of that.  Of course, nothing is perfect, but this camera delivers mostly in the areas that I need.PROS - high resolution; sturdy magnesium case; fairly straight-forward operation (easy to navigate even without the manual); better battery life than my previous Canon; 2.5-inch LCD screen; and 3.5 optical zoom.  This camera also has a viewfinder (no diopter adjustment).  I personally prefer a viewfinder to an LCD screen in certain settings, such as when the LCD is washed out by bright sunlight.  If a viewfinder is important to you, this has one.CONS - slight lag in Auto-Focus; wimpy accessory Nikon leather case (the Canon's case was of a sturdier, thicker leather); some learning curve going from Canon to Nikon equipment; and having to change from CF cards to SD memory cards.  The latter is not anyone's fault, since almost all new digital cameras seem to have adopted the SD format in order to achieve smaller physical form.All my previous cameras were Canon (even the film cameras).  While my current Digital ELPH was only 3 years old, advances made since 2004 easily eclipsed the old camera, and not just in MP resolution.  Things like Face-Recognition (available on several brands) and longer-life batteries greatly improve the camera's utility.Other models seriously considered were the Sony DSC-W200 (12.1 MP) and the Canon SD900 (10.0 MP).  All were in the same price range, but the Sony (new) and Canon were difficult to find.  I wanted to at least try this out in person before buying, rather than purchasing sight unseen.There are some features that digital camera manufacturers seem to always include that many users just do not use very often, if at all.  The P5000 has 16 \"scenes\" to shoot in a variety of conditions, such as Landscape, Museum, Sports, etc.  These \"scenes\" should have also included \"Cloudy\", \"Indoor Lighting\", etc.  These are on the Canon and while again not perfect, they were appropriate in many instances.  You can always retouch photos (to a certain extent) in ACDSee, PhotoShop, or any other similar programs.  But getting the exposure correct right from the start is always the best way to go.  The remedy on the P5000 is to stick with fully-automatic mode if you are unsure which \"scene\" is appropriate.  Photo-philes can manually adjust the speed and aperture - features I have not yet found on similarly-priced cameras.The various movie settings have a similar minor gripe.  It would have been good to also include an HD setting, but that may have been limited by memory restrictions.When you pick up the P5000, you will noticed that the shutter release button is located on the front edge of the right-side hand grip, not on top of the camera as is the case in most other models.  This is a design feature that is remedied only by time and familiarity.  Again, not a deal-breaker, but you may find yourself inadvertently pushing the function button rather than the shutter release.The price-point for 10-to-12 MP cameras, regardless of manufacturer, seems to be around $400.  It would be nice if they included 2 batteries for that price, but do not hold your breath.  If wireless capability is important to you, the P5000 does not have it.  You will still need to use the supplied USB cable or use an SD card adapter to transfer pictures from the camera.  The P5000 is so compact, you cannot fault the absence of WiFi.  There is also no way to remotely release the shutter, exception for the automated self-timer function.The P5000 has two features not found in comparable cameras - a hot shoe and a ring for adapter lenses.  The hot shoe is an interesting feature, since this is a compact digital camera and most people will want to just carry it around in their pocket.  But if you are so inclined, Nikon does offer a few small flash units specifically designed for this model.  They look kind of silly on the small camera and make it slightly unbalanced when attached, but if you need it, this is less of a hassle than carrying a second camera with a better flash unit.  I have not tried the lens adapters yet, but you can add dedicated lenses for improved wide-angle and telephoto.  Most P5000 buyers may never need these functions but Nikon's design appears to attempt to bridge the gap between high-performance compact digital cameras and a digital SLR.In conclusion, the P5000 gets 4 out of 5 stars.

Let me preface this by saying I am a Nikon fanatic with several Nikon cameras and a D200 dSLR. I have turned to the canon G7, though, as my point and shoot and thought I would try out the Nikon P5000 when it arraived at my local camera shop. I returned it a few days later and stuck with the G7 (see my review there for positives for the G7)The Nikon P5000 disappoints almost across the board. The look and build quality is that of the old Nikon 7900 model. It feels small and somewhat clumsy, although it appears sturdily built. It comes with a neckstrap and not a hand strap, kind of odd for a small light camera like this.The setup is easy, but limited. There are a few dedicated buttons for functions across the left rear of the camera, but most of them point to View options rather than shooting options. The G7 dedicated buttons and dials are far superior here.Day shots in bright sunlight are wonderful - exactly what you expect from Nikon. But indoor shots and flash shots become very problematic. High ISO is virtually unusable due to the noise created by the in-camera processing. The flash is extremely slow -- I haven't seen shutter lag like this since the early canon models. It even puts the Nikon P3/P4 models way above this (supposedly) higher level camera.I found shutter priority to be almost unusable - without cranking up the ISO, all you get are black shots. WIth higher ISO all you get is noise.  Aperture priority didn't create enough depth of field to see any significant difference. Do your own test -- line up three coffee cans about a foot apart on a counter - then try to focus on the back, the middle and the front coffee can and shoot for depth of field. With the G7 you get some nice blur toward the back, with the P5000 all shots are the same -- i.e. depth of field remains constant at the full-panoramic focus range. No artsy shots possible here.Where this camera excels is in day shots in sunlight under Auto settings. These produce good, crisp shots of stationary objects. But almost all point and shoots should produce those types of results.Movie mode is unusable -- the image does not remain steady (something the g7 does wonderfully) and the motor noise is so loud that it overpowers all real-life sound. Try your own test on that one -- the motor is just incredibly noisy.Finally -- ONE BIG WARNING -- this camera, while aimed at the more advance enthusiast, is terrible at capturing action -- exactly the type of thing many dSLR users will want in lieu of dragging along their larger cameras -- In other words, if you want photos of your squirming kids at Walt Disney World, or your dog running around the backyard, or your son hitting the whiffle ball off the T in that first little league game, your NOT GOING TO GET IT with this camera. By the time the autofocus kicks in, and the shutter activates, the lag is so horrendous that you will never get those action family shots you want.Your usage will of course vary depending on your own personal shooting style. For me, it gave me a nice form-factor camera, from a company I would love to support more, with exactly none of the features that I would need in a small point and shoot rather than my dSLR. I stuck with the Canon G7 and returned this. If you want to stick with Nikon, their best cameras remain the P3/P4 models if you can find them.ADDENDUM August 30, 2007 -- Nikon today announced an update to this camera, called the P5100, which will be available in late September.

I'm beyond mere point and shoot type photography although there are times when going fully automatic can be a godsend. My needs were more advanced and also had to consider my budget too in this process.My first digital camera was an old Kodak CX series 4mp camera that did allow for exposure adjustment, but that and ISO (\"film\" speed) only and had about a half dozen, if that scene modes, lens range is about the same for both however the Nikon is a 3.5x zoom whilst the Kodak only does 3x, both had digital zoom capabilities too.When the old Kodak took a tumble to the floor in the fall of 2005, I was able to nurse it along for about a year and a half off and on until it seemingly died this past January. To be honest, the Kodak was pretty good for what it was, it's macro was OK and I did get plenty of use from it which is more than I have with any film camera I've owned previously.First thing was I had been eying the Nikon cameras after some initial research on the previous 7600 and 7900 coolpix models and came close to buying one then, but my financial situation was dire and the funds had to be diverted to more important things so no camera then. And in that research was the fact that Nikon in it's coolpix line tend to not be as aggressive, generally, in their Jpg compression, nor as heavy handed with noise reduction compared to many companies for this type of camera.So when the situation finally came for me to be able to actually look into a new camera, I had been looking at several models, including the L12 and the S500 but ultimately, found myself suddenly able to afford a P5000, which is comparable to the old 7900 in features etc.Now I've also read the reviews here and elsewhere, and on major camera review sites such as DPReview, C/Net and others and the reviews of the P5000 were mixed with both good and negative comments, namely it's slow start up, slow shutter lag and focus, but it had very, very good image quality despite the 1-7/8\" 10MP sensor and it had a really good layout, good menu that is along the lines of their DSLR's and a very good grip, which allows for steady 1 handed shooting when needed.I was not able to get my hands on one to try out and then heard that it was being discontinued so had to act fast if I was going to get one and by that point, I found myself with funds to do so and ended up buying it without a tryout at a local camera store.In the 3 days since it arrived, I've been snapping pictures like nobody's business, mostly in manual mode and am learning quite fast it's idiosyncrasies and how one goes about adjusting aperture and shutter, sadly, one can't do true manual focus, but one can tell the camera how you want it to focus and one feature allows the user to move the focus metering brackets around to get the best readings for  both exposure and focus, in this instance, when shooting a dark scene with a bright spot, I can then scoot the metering bracket to get both the dark and light so when I adjust both the aperture and shutter, I can then see whether I'm over exposing or underexposing in either setting before I pre-focus by holding down the shutter halfway for a second before taking the shot. One thing the reviews do say is that this camera really isn't the best choice for sports type shots or any other fast action type shots although I've seen one case where it proved to be no so useless in that situation due to slow shutter speed and frames per second capture speed.Some pros/cons of this little darling.PROSExcellent gripEasily navigated menu system, easily learnedGood button layout and a nice set of separate buttons on the left of the LCD for functions such as preview, view options and to bring up the histrogram, sadly not available in real time but a minor quibble, the menu access and the delete button, on the right is the 4 way control button and OK button for navigating the menus along with accessing flash options, macro etc.Good low light sensitivityWide ISO range (64-3200) However with 3200ISO, the MP count drops to 5MP thoughOption to turn off noise reductionOptical vibration reductionCONSSlow focusDefinite shutter lagNoisy at higher ISO's above 200 ISO  (I've heard it's quite noisy but have not really tried it yet)Power button could stand to be a bit larger and in a better locationNo RAW capabilities for such a flagship camera for more advanced users while it's direct competition, the Canon G7 has it (I think and it's more expensive too).LCD is washed out in very bright light although one can adjust the settings and that might help some, don't know though.Overall, I found the con's to not be of issue to me based on how I use the camera and what I'm shooting. I hope to slowly get more and more familiar with it and slowly begin to stretch it's limits some in the future but from what I've experienced with it so far, it's a very excellent camera, it's easy to use, feels comfortable in a minimum of time spent with it and I'm really impressed with what I'm getting out of it already. One thing is for sure, I'm fast learning what to look for to determine if overexposing (or underexposing as well) as I go along and yesterday's photo shoot proved, 95% of my shots were more or less correctly exposed by the end of the day.A couple of caveats, it's now discontinued and is being replaced by the P5100, but at 12MP instead (and we don't know if it's image quality will suffer as of yet either and it's the same sensor as what's in the new Canon G9, the G7's replacement and it's proving a disappointment) and has some changes to the AF system which might address the slow shutter lag/focus issues. It's not in stores yet but was announced about a week ago though.If you are a beginner type or simply prefer a simple camera, this is more camera than you need and some of the reviews here have born that out where people bought it based on price and ended up returning it for it overwhelmed them with too much stuff.Overall though I really am liking this camera quite a bit.It's been a year and a half since I bought it and my overall view of this camera has held true. I've tweaked some of the settings and have learned how to expose to get a good image and all that. Most of the time I can get the camera to focus well and have found, despite some of the caveats that it does fine as long as you don't try to do much heavy action shots. That aside, I use it A LOT and really and truly enjoy it and I am now ready to move up to a D-SLR.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "So far so good.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RQJI5K7M3R1QI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera right before going on vacation.  I owned an old Nikon Coolpix 5000 and I was already familiar with most of the features.  It worked well on the trip and the battery lasted quite a long time.  I had three batteries with me (they are very inexpensive) and I normally lasted a couple of days just on one battery.I won't go into great detail on the features but I will talk about one I used most often on my trip.  It was the Panorama feature.  It allows you to align your camera in such a way that taking panoramic pictures is relatively easy... even without a tripod or a bubble level.The way it works is you set the camera to panoramic mode then take the first picture.  The LCD screen will display the edge of the last image so that you can align it up for the next shot.  This works very good if you are stitching together 3-4 images but beyond that you may end up needing a tripod and/or a bubble level.  Creating a full 360 degree panorama is child's play after that.Not only can the panorama feature work horizontal but can create vertical panoramas as well.  You can tell the camera what direction you want to move next and it will show you the proper alignment.  So if you wanted to create one \"big\" image from 9 images using a 3x3 alignment it is very easy to do.The camera comes with Arcsoft Panorama maker version 3 which will stitch the images  together for you.  It works well and I decided to upgrade to the 4.0 version but I liked 3 better though because it seems to do a better  job of making interactive panoramas in Apple Quicktime (another very cool feature).  Photoshop can do the same thing but I found that Arcsoft ran faster and it did not eat up as much memory.I posted three panoramic images I took on vacation.  See the Product images associated with this product to see  them.  They are MUCH smaller than the real output.The camera works with the new SDHC cards.  I bought a Kingston 8GB card and will probably never need another card again.  Saving images in the highest resolution is very fast.  Somewhere between 1-2 seconds.The biggest downside  I personally found is the inability to save in a RAW format.  RAW format is an unprocessed/uncompressed image that are very useful with using in Photoshop.  It gives the most detail and information for Photoshop to work with.  My older Coolpix 5000 did not originally have it but Nikon put out a software upgrade for the camera that gave it RAW format capability.  I am hoping they will do the same for the p5000 but so far no dice.Overall I really like this camera and am glad I purchased it.

I really like the VR and the fact that I can use my Nikon flash units.After about 500 shots with the P5000 I am very happy with it but one must realize that it is NOT a SLR and there are some cases when you miss a shot because of that.  Viewing a zoomed scene through the P5000 LCD can be very difficult in conditions except for very bright light.  It is hard to see what you are going to get.  With a SLR, you have no doubt.The other difference is the lag time in the shutter.  It is almost useless in fast moving sport action.  For example I was shooting the grand children on a Bungee Jump where they bounce on a trampoline and then bungee into the air about 20 feet while wearing a harness.  With the rangefinder camera, the action of the shutter does not keep up with the motion.  By the time the shutter reacts to your finger press on the button, the child is not in the frame.  The lag time is not fast.  With my D80, you get exactly what you see in the viewfinder because there is almost no lag time for the shutter to open.Overall, I give this camera FIVE Stars because it does VERY WELL what it was designed to do and it is very easy to hold and operate.  It is NOT a DLR but was not designed to be one.", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "nikon coolpix p5000", "Author": "Eric Kelley \"MotteAndBailey\"", "ReviewID": "R12114U7QNPYWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "camera arrived in new packing, all parts included.

Versatile.

It's not clearly visible at the images of the camera that you can see at Internet.And 2) The rear display is upper than the rest of rear surface.
