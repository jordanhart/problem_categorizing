{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Never thought I would switch to Panasonic, but here we go ...", "Author": "G Smart", "ReviewID": "R365I76YBWJ9M0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Though I owned a pretty good Panasonic video camera in the past, Panasonic's name never associated in my mind with quality photo cameras, but I'm happy I've been proven wrong. I did quite serious research in various DSLRs, 4/3rds, mirror-less APS-C cameras, and ended up choosing G3. It's not the best camera in the world, every camera has its own trade-offs, it's just the most satisfactory camera for my needs for the money I was willing to spend. Your mileage may vary.First of all, I would recommend to anybody considering buying this (or any other) camera do three things:-- Read professional reviews on dpreview dot com, it's important to see the objective tests and read professional opinion. But don't make final decision based on professional reviews. What reviewers achieved in controlled environment, putting their best efforts, may not be representative of what you get. In fact most cameras look in reviews much better than in reality.-- Check the average Joe the photographer pictures on pbase, flickr, etc. See how punishing or forgiving the camera is, compare to other cameras. I find the pictures of water especially revealing. Does the water look dark,  muddy, blotchy with visible noise, or pleasantly smooth, even oily? I found many G3 water images very pleasing. It's possible for a camera to produce outstanding results in controlled environment and yet fare much poorer in casual use.-- If possible, handle the camera in the store. See whether you like the weight and size, how soft/hard the release button is, whether you like the viewfinder, are dials/buttons readable, how quickly it focuses, etc. When I was trying to decide between Panasonic DMC-G3 and Sony NEX-5N, I found the first was a lot more comfortable in my hands, and I immediately noticed that Sony was hunting trying to focus in low light situation, while Panasonic locked focus quickly and silently. The small stuff like that may make a superb otherwise camera a source of annoyance, so try it before buying.I don't want to repeat technical reviews, which you can easily find on the web, rather mention pros and cons of this camera in my subjective opinion.Pros:* Perfect size and weight. This camera feels very comfortable in my hands and is easy to carry around. I have a Canon DSLR also and find it too heavy, too cumbersome to carry, especially with large lenses.Most pictures require little or no post-processing in normal settings. Colors are pleasing, well saturated, contrast is perfect, default sharpening is just right. Jpeg images are acceptable for web use, raw images look much better in print, especially when shooting landscapes. Though I think the colors are close to reality, I wouldn't vouch for that and frankly I don't care. I'm not a forensic photographer, it's more important to me if the colors are pleasing to look at and bring up memories of the event. So when I hear from Canon DSLR users about their plasticky dull colors that they are very real, I can't care less if it's true or not. I know that bringing up pleasing vibrancy in Canon images isn't easy and often impossible. After using Canon DSLRs for almost ten years I feel a lot happier with Panasonic images.* Autofocus is very quick and absolutely silent.* Manual focusing with three mode magnifier works great. Since the picture you see in the viewfinder comes from the sensor, what you see is what you get. No front or back-focusing problems, with any lenses, which is a common problem even with expensive DSLRs. Additionally, auto+manual focusing mode is an absolute gem. I keep camera always in this mode. If you don't have an opportunity to manually focus, do nothing, camera will focus automatically; if you do want to focus manually, touch the focus ring and camera will assist you.* I like the fact that flash is built in, and not a flimsy attachment, like in other cameras. It's quick to charge and always at hand, which is great because you never know when you might need it.* An electronic viewfinder is also a very good idea, in most cases it's more convenient than LCD. It's not as good in low light as optical viewfinder, but it shows more useful information and has additional functionality that optical viewfinders don't have, like manual focus assist.* Swiveling touchscreen LCD is also pretty handy. It makes it very easy to shoot from any position. I also like the fact that you can touch the screen to select the focus area and camera starts tracking it.* Good sensor resolution and more importantly high spatial frequency contrast produces well defined images. Pixel peeping folks should be satisfied. Full-size images look spectacular on large screen monitors. Enlargements are pretty easy too, 11x14 can be viewed from any distance without pixelization or loss of sharpness. I also printed 20x30 and they look sharp from 2 feet or more.* Video looks very good to me, though I haven't used it much.* If you have a Panasonic large-screen TV, then pop the SD card straight from the camera in to TV SD slot and select Viera tools and you can watch videos or slide shows without any additional processing.Cons:* Buttons on the right side could have been designed better. I frequently inadvertently press some of them with the thumb.* Buttons take time to get used to and remember how to set what you want. It's frustrating to scroll through pages of menus trying to locate stuff.* Low light, low contrast focusing can be imprecise, but this is a common problem of contrast focusing cameras.* High ISO pictures aren't particularly bad, but noise and blurriness become visible even on modestly large prints. It's not bad for web, but for large prints one should keep ISO under 200.* Battery is weak, good for only 270 pictures.* The choice of lenses is not big and they are quite expensive.* No Photoshop included! Instead you get a Silkypix software. It misses many useful Photoshop features, though it does have the essentials, but it's also a useability disaster. The program is so backwardly designed, it looks like it was created in 1980's.Finally, a few recommendations from personal experience. Shooting in RAW reveals more small detail and more importantly preserves better tonal transitions in landscape photos, so they look a lot better, I would recommend using RAW for those pictures for any size prints. To produce sharp, detailed pictures for large prints, you should keep ISO low, shutter speed shorter than 1/2f - 1/4f, or better yet use a tripod. Test your abilities to hold the camera steady, take pictures hand-held and with tripod and compare them on pixel level to see how much your hands are shaking. Every lens has its sweet spots where it shows best sharpness and contrast. You can find MTF charts for many lenses on the web. Many lenses have the best performance around F8. It also makes sense to use manual focus when feasible. Again, compare manual focusing with autofocus in various light condition to see when to use what. Taking pictures with telephoto 200-300 mm lens can be challenging. When you close the aperture down to F8, and set shutter to at least 1/1000, and ISO to 160, you can shoot only in a very bright sunny day. Therefore, a tripod when using telephoto lenses is virtually always a necessity. Also if you have difficulty manually focusing because your hands are shaking, you aren't likely to get sharp pictures. Get some practice on a gun range, familiarize yourself with shooting breathing techniques, take a half breath, let some out, hold it, steady your hands, push the trigger slowly. Many people blame a camera or lens for their blurry pictures, while the real reason is shaking hands, or poor focusing, or high ISO.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally the True Heir to the GF1.  Another winner from Panasonic", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R3AFRU1LBU7YH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have looked on with dismay as Panasonic abandoned the enthusiast small M4/3 and instead chases a smaller and smaller and dumber and dumber form factor with the GF line, then you now have a reason to be happy.  It appears Panasonic is positioning the G3 as the successor to the GF1.  They might not know that but that is how I view it.  Viewed as a replacement to the G2, the G3 is a bit of a let down.  Much the way the GF2 was compared to the GF1.  However, the G3 is a great replacement to the GF1.  It is a little bigger but not that much.  The physical controls are the same but now there is touch screen controls and to make up for many of the missing physical controls there are the C1 and C2 modes on the mode selector.  a Before continuing something that very few people seem to understand with these camera systems is the lens, not the camera body, determines how big the camera is.  I will use extremes to illustrate the point.  Put a 14mm f/2.5 on a GH2 and it seems very small.  You can't put it in a shirt pocket but it will fit inside a jacket pocket.  Also, you can get it in a very small carry case.  It is so small and light I use a wrist strap and not a neck strap.  Put a 100-300mm on a GF3 and it is going to be huge and because of the form factor really unusable.The first thing to note about the G3 is the price is $699.  That is $100 cheaper than the G1 or G2 at launch and $200 cheaper than the GF1.  In addition to being $200 cheaper than the GF1, the G3 has a built in EVF (would have been nicer rangefinder style) and a swivel screen.Another nice change from the G2 and the GF line is the new sensor.  Panasonic and Olympus have been using a 3 generation old sensor in every m4/3 line except the GH line.  The G3 now has a new 16mp sensor and updated image processing engine.  The G3 takes slightly better pictures than the GH2.As far as IQ goes, the m4/3 are not as good as DX sensors and they never will be as good.  The same way as DX sensors will never be as good as FX sensors.  All else being equal.  With that said, IQ merits some discussion as most people don't really understand it and most \"professional\" review sites confuse the whole issue.  Here is everything you need to understand on the issue.  First every generation of sensors the differences between m4/3, DX, and FX decreases.  At some point the difference become negligible.  Where that point is depends on what you want to do.  IQ is very dependent on the size of what you are going to do with the image.  I think for the vast majority of what people are doing, the differences are already negligible.  Here are a couple of examples of what I mean.  The biggest of computer monitors is right at 3.6mp.  Most are around 2mp.  That means to view a medium format 40mp image on a (2mp) monitor you are only using 5% of the image data.  The rest is getting thrown away.  For a 16mp image you are using 12.5% of the data.  So that means noise, detail etc is getting thrown away as you deres the image.  The same goes with printing.  The human eye can see 200-300 dots per inch (A useful piece of information is monitors used to be 72 dpi and are somewhere around 96 dpi.  That means if you blow an image up to 100% on your computer screen you are effectively magnifying by 2 to 3.  Therefore, the images at 100% on the computer monitor are not going to look as good as on paper)  Using 200 dpi, that means you need 2000x1600 pixels to print a decent 8x10.  If you do the math that means you need 3.2mp to print an 8x10.  (At 300 dpi you would need 7.2mp)  That means for a 16mp image you are using 20% of the data.  If this fits what you are doing, then any IQ differences are not important for you.  As you start printing larger than this, the difference can be noticeable.Where these m4/3 cameras excel is handling.  The GH2 is the king, in my opinion, for handling.  The controls are so well laid out it is a breeze to do anything you want quickly.  Additionally, the contrast based auto focus is so fast, that live view is exceedingly useable.  The swivel screen gives you huge options over a hold up to the eye only or a fixed back screen.  You can hold the camera way over your head or way down by your feet and still frame the image.On top of that is the light weight.  It has gotten to the point that I don't travel with my Nikon D7000 at all.  I only keep and use that for portrait/wedding/event type photography (I did however just shoot a wedding with m4/3 only.  The 100-300 was my primary lens.  It is a little slow but still grabbed some amazing shots).  I usually travel with 2 GH series bodies, 5-8 lenses, and an iPad all in a Domke F4 bag.  (With my G3 I will now travel with 3 bodies)  All of this weighs right around 10 lbs.  You could also just carry the 7-14, 14-140, and 100-300 lenses and cover from 14mm to 600mm equivalent with 3 lenses.  All of these lenses can be attached to 3 camera bodies and in the F4.  You could even add a 4th body and add the 20mm f/1.4.  That would still fit in the F4 and weigh in around 10lbs.I don't really do that much with video so I am not really going to comment that much on it.  However, video on the G3 is far easier and more useable than any DSLR except for the Sony A33/55.  Also, there is a built in stereo mic but no external connector.  I don't think the latter is big deal for most people.Construction on the G3 is very nice.  It is the first of panasonic m4/3 which uses aluminum in the construction instead of all plastic.Handgrip.  I am a little disappointed at the loss of the handgrip as it is essentially free.  I am still not sure how I feel about the new hand \"bump\" especially for the bigger lenses.  I will have to report on that one later.  If you are coming from a GF1 then this is a step up.  Since the old handgrip was shorter than the shortest lens, I am not sure what we are really gaining by this.  It also means the loss of space for the battery so Panasonic had to use a smaller battery.  I believe it is the same as the GF2.  The smaller batteries means less pictures so make sure you have a spare.  It is rated at 270 shots but a secret with Panasonic m4/3 is to turn your camera off after shooting.  Doing that I get around 750-800 shots.  I also have the auto review switched off.For anyone who is new to a more complicated camera, Panasonic has two very cool features to make it a little easier to use.  The first is Program shift mode and the newest one, only on the G3 right now, is iAuto+.  The program shift mode obsoletes the Aperture priority mode.  As you press the button half way down to get the exposer numbers.  You can then rotate the thumbwheel to goto a bigger aperture (smaller DOF) or larger aperture (larger DOF).  The iAuto+ now allows you to adjust white balance, exposure compensation, and aperture (defocus control).  This is a very handy feature and is good for the expert and beginner alike.  For the expert you can now stay in iAuto more often when in a fast moving shooting situation.  The camera will recognize the scene and make hundreds of changes to make the scene look best as possible.  You can now easily change the exposure and work the aperture.  For the beginner, you can start in iA.  After getting comfortable with that you can now start playing with aperture and exposure (the 2 most important controls in my opinion) while still having the \"safety\" of iAuto.  When you get more comfortable with that then moving to P mode is an easy jump.  With program shift there are not many reasons to shift over to A or M mode but when you need to it is there for you.Auto ISO and iAuto ISO.  Auto is based on light level and iAuto is based on light level and movement of subject.MF Assist  The manual focus for m4/3 lenses is fly-by-wire.  That means there are no stops.  On the first generation G bodies it was horrible.  On second generation Panasonic added a scale marker which was really nice.  On this generation, Panasonic added picture in picture for manual focus assist.  This is a really nice feature as I can focus and frame at the same time.  The m4/3 allows the use of just about any lens made.  However, you lose auto focus.  So for those with old film lenses there is probably an adaptor that can allow it to fit on the m4/3.  For that purpose and when auto focus has trouble the new manual focus assist is very nice.I mentioned before the loss of physical controls on the camera.  For enthusiast this is a step backwards.  For newbies this is probably a good thing.  The touch screen implementation is very nice but I am still not convinced I like it better than physical controls.  However, for enthusiast the loss of these controls is partially made up for with the C1 and C2 modes.  Now before you get into the fray, you can set the camera up for 2 custom modes and then just switch between the modes.  Therefore, you don't need to do as much fiddling.  Also, Q menu and Display buttons are now programmable functions buttons.  Therefore, if there is some function you use a lot and can't get to easily, now you can put it on one of these buttons.  Panasonic's menus aren't that great.  So I recommend leaving the Q menu button as is.  It relieves a ton of scrolling through menus.  I rarely ever use the Display button, I think the most I use it is when I am trying to go back to the display I want after it was accidentally touched.A big loss is the auto switch between EVF and screen.  On the previous Gs and GHs, there was a sensor to determine if your eye was up to the EVF.  If so it switched off the back screen and switched on the EVF.  Now you will have to use the button to switch.  Bad move from my perspective.  However, if you are coming from a GF1 or P+S, the fact that it has an EVF is a big plus.Overall,  this camera has amazing capabilities in a small light and easily accessible package.  The handling on these cameras is amazing and the camera gets out of the way to let you do what you want to do.  This camera has so many capabilities there is no way to review them all in one of these reviews.  If you have any specific questions, please ask in a comment and I will get back with you as soon as possible.I have the Red version.  My wife says with the RED version of the G3 you can't help but smile when you see it.  So I am hoping for some great pictures.ProsAmazing handling - Not as good as GH2 but almost - For me GH2 is best in the business for handlingSmall- Not pocketable but then again neither is the G12, LX5, OZ1, or P7000 and this camera spanks all of the above mentioned cameras for IQ and features.LightNice construction - Some aluminumNice new feature set (focus assist, iAuto+, C1+2, F1+2, etc)Nice new sensorBest high ISO of any m4/3 so far - ISO 1600 JPGs good and ISO 3200 usable for on screenVery good GF1 replacementConsDisappointing G2 replacement - Panasonic still has yet to make a high end enthusiast/pro stills focused camera.Same mediocre shutter specs - 1/4000 and 1/160 or worse flash syncNo electronic shutterIQ not as good as DX or better (However, better than my 3 year old DX Nikon D300)Smaller battery due to loss of gripNo social networking featuresBuying ConsiderationsSomeone Stepping Up to a \"DSLR\" category cameraOf the Panasonic m4/3 this is a great one to start with.  Lots of features but accessible.  The only other m4/3 I would currently consider is either of the GH cameras.  (GH1 is $399 for body only).  Olympus still has 3 generation old sensor and molasses slow focus.  (From what I have seen, Olympus is about to announce a new PEN camera that uses a new 12mp (I am glad they are stopping at 12 as that is more than enough) and new lenses that feature blazing fast autofocus (faster than the G3).  If it pans out it could be the new camera to own.  Of note, Olympus made the Pro lenses for the 4/5 cameras and they were great.  They are bringing out a 12mm f/2.8 for $800.  So this is going to be for enthusiast or pros.)Someone who already Owns a M4/3For the G1 and GH1 this is a very good trade up.  Skipping each generation is actually a good technique.  The G2 was a huge disappointment for me so this even makes sense as an upgrade over the G2 since that camera had the same sensor as the G1.  None of the Olympus has an EVF built in or a swivel screen.  They do have better IQ generally and internal image stabilization.  The autofocus is also really slow.  To me the handling and auto focus speed trump the other considerations so I think the Panasonic is better.  Others prefer the cache of the PEN.  If it is form over function, then stick with PEN otherwise G3.  Do take note of what I wrote above about new PEN.Someone who owns a DSLR and is tired of lugging the weight and wants a portable high quality camera.This is a great choice.  The price is only $200 more than the advanced compact cameras.  None of them can approach the G3 for what it can do.  It is not pocketable but neither are they.  A G3 with the 14mm, 25mm, and 45mm primes makes for a very lightweight and portable system that can cover just about any situation.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Love my G3", "Author": "M. Banas \"MB\"", "ReviewID": "R1IO6ZYA5U4IYM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took my G3 on my four week vacation to Europe.  I also bought the 20mm f1.7 pancake to go along with it.  I'm back from my trip and here are my impressions:What could be better:- Feels solid but a bit heavier than expected.  I can fit it into some of my jackets' pockets but it weighs the jacket down too much.- Shape of camera not as pocketable as I'd hope, mainly due to protruding EVF, only large pocets work even with a pancake lens.- EVF is great for composing shots but not good enough for evaluating exposure, the 3\" LCD does a better job.- Compared to APSc censors the dynamic range is not as wide, however much better than any compact I ever used.  I compared some high contrast shots to my friends Nikon D5100, and his camera was better at preserving highlights.  Non high contrast scenes were comperable.- White Balance could be better in artificial light.What I love:- Smaller and less intrusive than a full sized SLR.- Looks great, especially with the 20mm pancake.- Great handgrip & controls- Easy to use if you need to capture a spontenaous mement.- Intuitive controls if you want to get creative.- Fast shooting.- Great Looking PhotosAll in all the G3 is not as pocketable as I'd hoped, but that is the tradeoff oh having an EVF and manual controls, and for me it's worth it.  The camera easly slips into a small messenger style bag.  Once I got over the portablity issue I fell in love with the camera, it's just fun to use, and the photos are great.  I especially love it with the 20mm pancake for a really portable package.  I took 1,500 hundred photos on my trip, reviewed them all, and I am very pleased.  This camera is not for everyone however it's great for anyone that wants to take charge of the camera, play with manual controls and get creative controls without the bulk of an SLR.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "If you're a newbie", "Author": "PierrefromBayRidge", "ReviewID": "R3CPDAP5BK1JTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On the one hand I'm leery of reviews from people who have just received a complicated piece of equipment, but I believe my thoughts of the G3, even though I've only had it a few days, may prove valuable to those who have a viewpoint similar to mine.My viewpoint is not so much that of a newbie, as I had SLRs back in the days of film, but more of one who has preferred to let the advanced cameras of today do most of the work and leave me to simply compose my shots. So why did I decide to move up? A couple of basic reasons. My Panasonic DMC ZS3 doesn't have a viewfinder and I found myself taking shots by guesswork as when I was in bright sunshine I just couldn't see the screen. So getting a camera with a viewfinder was a priority. And after much research, once I decided to make that move, going to a premium point and shoot with a viewfinder, like the Canon G12, didn't make as much sense as going the DSLR route, as neither is pocketable. My other reason is that point and shoots are slow so when it comes to taking people shots when they are not posing, like children at play, most such shots end up being blurry. I've got my first grandchild on the way, so I wanted to be prepared. I have no intention of giving up my 12x zoom, pocket ZS3 as in some situations it will be what is called for, but from what I've seen of the G3, it was the right purchase.Some of my first shots with the G3 were out the window of a moving car. I wasn't trying for great pictures, just seeing if they'd be usable, and they are. I chose a high shutter speed, 1000, and voila, I could get clear snaps of people walking down the street. That tells me that moving kids when I'm standing still should be a breeze. I also took some shots of cars in a parking lot, and when I zoomed in on them, I could read the license plates. Was there \"noise\" of course. But I'm never going to blow up most of my shots so who cares. Anyway, this was just a test to see how good or bad shots from a moving car would be. And to be able to just keep clicking away without waiting for the camera to catch up to me was a joy, so when the experts say that automatic focus works great, they're right.But the word speed has different connotations and while the G3 can shoot really fast, if you're going to set up the shots yourself, rather than use the automatic setting, then speed goes out the window. If you're the type of photographer who goes out by him or herself to take pictures, this is no problem. But if you're a tourist with your spouse and you need to start adjusting each setting before you take the shot, then you're spouse is going to quickly get tired of the process. Now the G3 can act like a point and shoot, which is good, but if using all the bells and whistles is going to make life harder for you, then maybe you want to think again.One thing I did not read about the G3, as the experts all assumed I knew, was that when zooming (the optical with the kit lens is only 3X) it's all manual. I've been used to pushing a button and the camera zoomed itself. Not a big deal, but newbies need to know they'll be twisting the lens to zoom.Also not really mentioned in reviews is that there is added digital zooming power, 2X and 4X, so you can actually get to 12X, though it's digital, not optical. I know, if you're making poster sized pictures, this is terrible, but if all you'll do with those pix is load them into a digital frame, then they're fine. But since you have to turn the zoom feature on, and it's limited to off or one of the two zooms, you can't go from zero zoom to 12X. If you have 4X on, then you're starting out at 4X and when you zoom out the lens, you're going to 12X. Also when you look at your pictures in the camera, zoomed or not, you can blow them up to 16X, and do that just by touching the screen a few times.If you read the basic manual, they tell you that the touch screen takes some pressure to get going. If you don't, you might assume it stinks. It's fine once you know this, but again, be aware. I will say it takes enough pressure that I find myself using the scroll wheel a lot.Maybe I need to read the manual some more (definitely I do) but I discovered that the camera wouldn't take some shots. I suppose I had settings that it thought would lead to a bad picture, but I was surprised by that.I have fairly small hands, probably the size of the Japanese engineers who developed the G3 and even I find some of the controls on the small side. Now I wanted a small camera, but if anyone out there has huge paws, definitely don't buy without trying it out.Hope these first impressions will prove helpful to someone considering getting this camera.PS I discovered that if you turn on the camera with the LCD facing in, that is to say with it's protected back facing out, the viewfinder goes on automatically. Makes sense, but also means you're saving power, which is good. But more importantly, I discovered that when you're looking through the viewfinder you can see the ISO setting (unless you're in Intelligent ISA instead of auto, and I've yet to figure out the difference) but if you're looking at the LCD, the ISO value isn't there! I'm guessing that they think beginners are more likely to use the LCD and don't need that info, though there's certainly a lot more real estate on the LCD. And I was just fooling around inside the house taking practice pictures and noticed that the camera chose an ISO of 800. Naturally I'd want a lower value if I was taking \"good\" shots. There's a button on the back that lets you set the ISO, but I can imagine those who are just getting into DSLR world and using the LCD forgetting to think about ISO. Maybe all DSLRs are like this but if this is your first, be warned.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "A review for those that need a viewfinder", "Author": "Matthew D. Ruffell", "ReviewID": "R3BE3VMTP89PR8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I traded in my Panasonic GF2 (which I loved) for the G3.The problem with most small compact M4/3 systems is that they don't have a viewfinder.  Its a catch 22 because the M4/3 mirror-less standard was designed to reduce the camera package size, yet the addition of a viewfinder now makes the camera larger. However, as I quickly learned, a viewfinder is critical for bright outdoor photography.  I haven't seen a LCD screen on a camera yet that works great in bright sun. A viewfinder is better.When the G3 was released I was pleased to see that Panasonic focused on all the right things.  Image quality, articulating screen, viewfinder, and simple effective controls.  The final \"icing on the cake\" was the reduced camera size compared to previous models with built-in viewfinders. The G3 is not much bigger than the GF2, in fact it feels like the GF2 with a really good viewfinder attached to it. In fact it still fits in my GF2 camera bag, a bit snug but it fits. Bottom line is that the G3 is still way smaller than a large bulky DSLR.I highly recommend upgrading to the G3 if you have a non-viewfinder M4/3 system.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "limited battery life", "Author": "James T.

When I got my camera I was disappointed  with the fact Panasonic had changed the battery from my GF1.. that said, the battery took overnight to charge and then shot only a few images without going dead. I read on the net that you could not use the rear panel LCD screen to view during shoots if you wanted to take more than a few images before the battery died.. Well after cycling my battery a few times, it charges fast and holds a good strong charge. This summer I shot a car show, taking more than 400 images using the EVF and then opened the LCD to compose with it and shot more than 400 more images using the rear panel to compose in full sunlight before the battery died. SO, my initial fear of poor battery life has been put too sleep. The thing I love about the camera is the simple fact, if you use a manual focus lens from your Leica lens collection or other brand of manual lens, the new LCD panel contains enough data to allow you to easily focus without the need for an accessory to aid in seeing if the lens is properly focused... I love the images I got with the GF1, the G3 is a much improved camera, you will love it..

At this time, I own six digital cameras, three  Olympus, one  Fuji, one Canon and the Panasonic G3. The G3 is the best in terms of image quality and color. It is an excellent tool for my kind of photography. By my kind, I mean slow, careful nature photography almost always using a tripod. I shoot aperture priority, with the smallest possible aperture and a long shutter speed. I also do a little bird photography, with the Olympus 70-300mm lens (using an adapter on the G3).Many reviews of this camera have been negative about the 14-42mm lens, which is described as soft. This is not true, at least if you stop it down. The JPEGS are good, and can be made excellent with Photoshop Elements. The 45-200mm lens is a nature photographer's dream and has excellent macro capabilities. I also use a Sigma 105mm macro lens on the adapter. This works well, too, but will only focus manually.All in all, a great camera.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally, I can stop comparing hundreds of cameras", "Author": "Steve Eagle", "ReviewID": "R1VATIJNSQULH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been living with a piece of crap Sony Cybershot camera I bought out of necessity years ago when my real camera got stolen on a vacation, and the frustration of shooting on this thing finally got to me. I spent literal weeks annoying my wife and giving myself migraines by comparing all the different kinds of cameras on the market. I'm an amateur, so my priority with photography is having a camera that gives me the simplicity I need now with the potential for greater control down the road. With this in mind I narrowed down my choices to a few camera classes: the Micro 4/3s, Sony NEX's, and enthusiast P+S.Very difficult to only pick one of these. If money was no issue, I'd get at least one interchangeable lens system and one P+S. But alas, money is always a primary factor in these things so I had to make a decision about what was most important to me: picture quality & versatility or portability? After much mental exercise, I decided that having a versatile and high quality camera was more important than something that could fit in my pocket. So that eliminated the Olympux XZ-1 and Canon Powershot S100 that I had been considering (though I'd still love an XZ-1 one of these days).The second decision was far more difficult. Micro 4/3s or Sony NEX? The Sony NEX series is the most popular on Amazon and has all sorts of hype around it. It's so slim, it looks cool, it has that huge APS sensor, etc etc. And in the Micro 4/3s class, there are so many more affordable options and way more lenses available (and let's be honest, glass is a huge element in taking good photos). While I've wanted a Sony NEX since it was first introduced, I actually started leaning towards the Panasonic G3 when put side by side in my comparisons. What really intrigued me about this camera was that it had all the DSLR features built in already and even resembled a DSLR, but at about half the size and weight, and at a pricepoint that was much more agreeable than competing models without those features. No, it didn't have the supermodel body of the Sony NEX, but seemed quite a bit more practical. Personally, I am not always going to remember to bring a detachable flash with me when I take my camera out on trips. Nor am I going to feel excited about spending $200 or $300 on a separate viewfinder that I also need to keep track of. The G3 integrates these basic (and in my mind, essential) functions into the camera body, eliminating the possibility of someone absent-minded like me forgetting items at home... or worse, on the road.The other thing that made the G3 rise to the top of my list was the swivel LCD screen. While the Sony NEX-5N has the articulating screen, I find the G3's screen with its full range of motion to be significantly better. I prefer the screen being off to the side so that my hand holding the camera doesn't interfere with my view of the screen, especially if I'm holding it way above my head. Both cameras can achieve the same kinds of photos, but the G3 makes it easier. The EVF on the G3 is also pretty good. It's a lot easier to adjust menu settings on the LCD, but the EVF controls are sufficient for most things I want to do, and I find myself using the EVF just as much if not more than the LCD for composing shots.So anyways, I ended up getting the G3 (obviously). I've only had it for a few days and still learning the basic modes and settings, but I can say pretty definitively that it takes excellent photos, gives me the fast autofocus and blurred backgrounds I was craving, is extremely well constructed and feels great in the hand, and is just a pleasure to use. The included zoom lens is not that fantastic, but it's a good enough starter lens for someone like me. With a 32GB SDHC card installed I can take 1,141 photos in combined RAW+Fine mode which is more than I'll ever need in one day. Well, who knows - I am traveling to Yellowstone soon :)PS: Definitely keep your eye on the price of this camera as it dropped twice within a week from the date I purchased it.EDIT 5/10/12: After a few hundred shots in different conditions I've learned a few extra things I wanted to share. The main thing I've noticed is that in low light, indoor situations, the iAuto mode will not raise the ISO sufficiently to capture the shot. It seems to always want to shoot at 800 during the night, so I find myself switching into Program mode and changing ISO to 1600. It makes a tremendous difference. Noise is completely absent from these shots too. Another thing I've had to change is the behavior of the manual focus ring in different record modes. It's called MF Assist, and if you start adjusting the manual focus ring on the zoom lens when in MF mode, it will zoom in on the area you're pointing at on your LCD or EVF. This makes it very difficult to compose a shot, because now all you can see is a fuzzy square in the middle of your screen resulting from that digital zoom. I promptly turned this feature off after missing a few great photo opportunities while in MF mode - I have no idea where this would ever come in useful. One last thing, the delay when recording an image in RAW+Fine mode is substantial, so I would go to only Fine or only RAW mode when you are doing any kind of action shots, even some photo shoots. Maybe I'm just impatient, but a few seconds can mean the difference between THE shot and a throwaway shot.That's it for now - all in all I am still enamored with this camera. Because of the inadequate ISO in iAuto mode in low light, I'm pretty much staying in Program mode these days, with white balance set to Auto and ISO manually adjusted based on what I'm shooting. It didn't take long to figure out how to cycle between these settings quickly, another reason I love having the manual mode dial on the camera body.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Photographically, this is the real deal", "Author": "T Boyer \"seattleparent\"", "ReviewID": "R2M9KMI6ZS5FGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great walking around camera; some people compare it to the Leica M series.1) Resolution is remarkable; enough detail for 13 x 19 prints with plenty of room to spare.

A good place to compare images close-up is the Comparometer on the Imaging Resources site.2) The 14-42 kit lens is definitely inferior to 14-45 lens that was bundled with the G1 and G2. I'd encourage people to just buy the body and then get the 14-45. The 14-45 performs uncommonly well without any need for post-processing because lens correction is built into the camera software.3) For HDR enthusiasts the Panny G series is a favorite because it can autobracket 7 exposures (Nikon and Canon only build that into their super-expensive professional DSLRs) One of the improvements in the G3 is a wider autobracketing exposure range.4) This is a great learning camera because it does a super job on automatic settings.

I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of pictures, even (especially?;) in the automatic mode, and the ease of manual control, and its depth-of-field magic, how good it feels in the hand (despite spots of roasted marshmallow coating, but that's a whole other story;).That said, I am afraid I got spoiled by the ubiquitousness and the invisibility of phone cameras, and G3 sometimes feels like it's too much to put into my bag, or between me and my subjects. This is hardly G3's fault -- it's so small for what it is!! -- but I find myself longing for a good small-ish boxy camera with a pancake lens (kind of like GF1 or E-PL3, but, perhaps, with a built-in viewfinder?), under $700-$900.

In the last decade complemented with a compact digital, Canon G series. Good as far as compactness and user control - but limited because of the small sensor size.I live in Argentina, where the HW is more expensive than for you guys in the US. After years watching the technology development and pondering alternatives, a few months ago finally made the move to a system digital camera: a Panasonic G3 with the standard kit zoom.My experience:The G3 is good: lightweight, nice electronic through the lens view, nearly instantenous shots, good controls. Any old SLR user will feel comfortable.ISO 800 images are almost as good as ISO 160, unless you look very, very closely at a large print.The included flash is OK to fill-in purposes.Replacement batteries costing a fraction of the original ones work fine.Jpgs out of the camera are good, but RAWs processed with default settings on the provided Silkypix SW are better. And if you have the time, read carefully the Silkypix help file, a lot of power is hidden in there.The kit lens is OK, but not great in terms of resolution.I bought an inexpensive Fotodiox adapter MD-to-micro 4/3 to use my 30+ years old Minolta lenses.The MD-Rokkor 100 mm F/2.5 makes wonders on the G3: great resolution, nice bokeh, lots of light gathering. Of course autofocus and antishake are gone. The comparision is not quite fair, but it equals a 200mm in terms of full size 35mm. In the real full size sensor world, it would take a Nikon 200mm f/2 with a list price of $ 5.999,95 to have the equivalent...As I do flowers photos, am considering to add the highly regarded panasonic macro 45mm f/2.8 ($ 600). In the meantime, i put to work another oldie, the MD-Rokkor 35mm f/2.8 on a set of m4/3 extension rings, with great results for macro work. And by the way, the 35mm makes an ultrasharp short telephoto lens, two f-stops brighter than the zoom kit lens.To carry all the gear, i use a small camera bag, and also bought a flexible Fotodiox neoprene sleeve for the camera alone. Funny, but fills its purpose.IMHO, very few amateurs do need a larger sensor: today, for practically every system camera in basic configuration, the bottleneck is the lens.Panasonic and Olympus bet on micro 4/3.

In fact I use the same bag to carry it often.While the Canon-Nikon DSLRs are still ahead when it comes to action and low light, this camera proves that the MFT is catching up. It is already easier than DSLRs to capture video. The MFT system is turning out to be an excellent middle (2x crop) format system between the p&s; and big DSLRs. The Lumix 20mm prime is a gem. Now I don't have to carry my heavy Canon camera+lens or settle for an Elph to get some decent pictures of the family on a day trip.In comparison to the PEN E-PL2, IMO the jpegs in the Olympus are better with the the 20mm prime. Pictures seem more natural and the PEN's retro-styling is nice. Both the G3 and E-PL2 are fun to use. I would say Panasonic is better at the technical aspects (sensor fab and overall build), where Olympus understands photography better (as an art). I like that both companies have different merits, but follow the same format.After the disappointing release of the GF2 and GF3, Panasonic redeems itself with the G3 and takes the MFT system forward.

This camera is not a full DSLR but it is way better than that point and shoot that you've been using. Anyone can review a camera, but only you can determine what fits your needs and desires.Many years ago, I had a Canon AE-1. I used that camera until it finally wore out.  That camera was perfect for me, with it's focus assist.  It gave me some great pictures of our trips and later the kids as babies.  Then the digital age started and I bought one point and shoot after another but was never happy with the results, though it was nice to not have to spend money on bad pictures. Continuously searching I never found a great camera. A few months ago  I sensed that It was time to upgrade again,  DSLR's were still too big and way too expensive. However, point and shoots weren't giving me the flexibility I wanted nor the results I needed. Then I happened upon the micro 4/3 system.  Smaller than a full sized DSLR but with many of the features.  I spent an enormous time researching this camera and others like it.  After reading all about it, I was able to play around with at a several cameras at Best Buy.  Once I had it in my hand I knew it was the right camera for me.  It's about the size of my old SLR with some cool tricks up its sleeve.First of all, I liked the price. More than I would have spent on a point and shoot, but no DSLR comes close to the price range. Since Panasonic has come out with a newer model the price is even better. However, because there is a newer model, this model may be difficult to find in a brick and mortar anymore.2nd - I liked the size.  The Sony may have better results in low light, but the camera body was smaller than the lens and felt awkward. The Nikon has a feature that you can shoot video and stills at the same time, but I didn't like the menu and it didn't feel right.  Besides the ads disgusted me.3rd- I liked the interchangeable lens.  So far I just have the kit lens, but am already researching a second fixed lens for indoor low light with small aperture settings, and for portraits. The kits lens takes great pictures but I just want to have options.4th- As soon as I picked it up and turned it on in the store, I noticed the ease of use. If it's too complicated you just won't use it.  I will admit going online to get help setting the camera up at first, and finding my way through the menus but after that I think the menu system is easy to figure out.Finally I really loved the swivel LCD touch screen (not available on the newer model) and the focusing system. I recommending watching the video on the Panasonic website.  There are also several youtube videos out there. The touch screen is responsive,  and the pinpoint focus is fast and gives amazing detail even when using the kit lens for macro photography.Overall, the camera is a great size, is flexible and comes at a price point you may be willing to handle,  Most importantly it takes great photos.  I love capturing memories and seeing what I can create with it.  Isn't that really why we take pictures to begin with?

It's a manual zoom, which I find very flexible and the traditional focusing ring is sensitive enough that I found manual focusing easy. The lens has built in image stabilization so even when hand holding at longer exposures there's very little blur.While it's not perfect for everything the kit lens gives you a pretty good range from landscape to portrait. And if it's not a full on macro lens, it doesn't do too badly there either.Image quality is great and the large sensor, when compared to a point and shoot, means it handles low light shooting pretty well too. Within reason.Other nice features include the fully articulated LCD touch screen which makes it easy to take photos from odd angles or to quickly focus on a particular subject. The viewfinder is nice too. No it's not optical (this is a micro 4/3rds after all) but it's a large LCD viewfinder which makes it very easy to see details as you're composing your shot.But my favorite is actually the speed the camera turns on.

This camera inspires me!Pros:- small and lightweight. It won't fit in your pocket, but it's small enough that you will forget it's there.- good feel/grip when hand holding- full range of control from complete auto to full manual...perfect for upgrade from point and shoot camera for those who want to do more with their camera- take movies from any mode/settings by pushing record button. Movie mode is more or less full auto... which I like since I'm not into videography and just want great home movies.- take pictures while recording movies- intuitive menu system- touchscreen is very useful and surprisingly effective- autofocus is fast and accurate. very cool touch to focus while taking movies or touch to focus/take shot in picture mode.- manual focus is fun and effective with MF assist.- Mega OIS (image stabilization on the 45-200mm) is really nice. note all Panny lumix lenses have OIS in the lens if at all.- bundled software (especially sikypix) actually useful- great family of lenses to choose from- perfect for shooting my son's baseball games!- great high ISO performance up to about 1600.- great resolution at 16MP- built-in electronic viewfinder is really nice. can't imagine buying a competitor's camera without a viewfinder.Cons:- kit lens is slow (ie, you will need flash for most low light/ indoor shots...typical for kit lenses from any brand)- good lenses tend to be very pricey- as with all DSLR type cameras, movies can exhibit \"jello effect\" if there is excessive camera movement.  This isn't too hard to avoid... and forces you to learn to move slowly while taking video which results in better videos anyway.I highly recommend this camera for anyone looking to upgrade from a P&S; like I did.

Great system but the lenses are not really supported any more by newer bodies as Olympus has gone to micro 4/3. I had heard good things about Panasonic and Olympus and the small size appealed to me. I have an active 2 year old and I wanted a high quality camera that also took video and was lightweight and easy to use; yet had a fast shutter and took great pictures.Enter micro 4/3. The web has a wealth of in-depth reviews of almost all cameras. People really are enthusiasts when it comes to photography. So I would check those out. Right now this camera is an absolute steal. I actually went for a body only and then the kit lens 14-42 sold here so I can comment on both. I bought the E-Volt when it was a couple of years old and you can really get great value if you are willing to take that approach.The G3 has exceeded my expectations. It takes crisp, vivid, detailed pictures with very accurate colors. The 'contrast' focusing is very fast. The G3 has a lot of great features. One of the best is the intelligent auto. You have 2 options. One that does almost everything and another one where you can select depth of field, white balance, and under or over exposure the picture. A great design element that I think EVERY camera manufacture should follow is that there is not a separate mode on the mode dial for getting into intelligent auto. Rather there is a button that changes any of the modes into intelligent auto. So if you like aperture priority you can stay on that and then just hit and un-hit the button to get into the auto mode whenever you like.Another great feature is the viewfinder. The screen is great. It swivels, it is high quality you can touch it to focus and even use it as a shutter. But the electronic viewfinder is great, especially with a telephoto lens. The trade of this though is that it is not as compact as some of the other 4/3. But it is still more compact and lighter than any DSLR.Great video. I have the kit lens and also the Vario PZ 45-175mm. That lens takes better video than any camcorder I have ever used. Extremely good outdoor video. Good indoor video.Kit lens: great optics, but cheap zoom. People vary widely on the kit lens. Since I bought the body first I had a lot of options for lens. I went with the kit lens because many reviews I went to said the kit lens had great optics but 'felt cheap'. The optics though people said were on par with the older 14-45 kit lens. The optics are very good with this kit lens. And the zoom is not an issue on pictures. However it does take some practice on videos or you will get a very choppy and noisy zoom.Micro 4/3 is now going to be my 'beyond good point and shoot' photo system. I like that lenses can be used on Panasonic and Olympus bodies and the reviews of the lenses. I mentioned Panasonic Lumix G X Vario PZ 45-175mm/F4.0-5.6 Lens for Panasonic Lumix G-Series Digital Cameras. In addition to that you might want to check out highly regarded 20mm lumix lens and a 25mm Panasonic Leica lens. They are pricey. Make no mistake you can easily spend DSLR money on a micro 4/3. But I was able to get the body, kit lens, and 45-175 all for under $600 in February of 2013.One other lens I should mention as a 'prime' lens (prime means fixed focal length) it is the sigma 30mm. Sigma also makes a 19mm. The current versions are highly rated. But in late January they announced updated lenses in what they are calling their 'art' series. They still don't have nearly the f stop the 20mm and 25mm I mentioned above do, but I may hold off getting a prime until those come out.Bottom line with the G3 is DSLR quality in a (relatively) small body. Great user friendliness, super responsive focusing, quick shutter action (compares to DSLR NOT high end point and shoot), and a variety of highly ranked lenses. But for all of that you are spending close to or as much as DSLR money. Was it a good choice for me? Yes. The lighter weight, smaller the cameras are the more use they will get. I just don't want to lug around a lot of camera when out with the family. And the pictures are great. The price now is less than many point and shoot. Your zoom range is less, but oh how much camera itself you get for the money.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome camera", "Author": "mohanram", "ReviewID": "RMUUU4JBMSALJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera ans I really like it a lot.

It has a great deal going for it. Like, for instance, you can set it to Automatic (idiot) mode with a push of a button wherever you happen to be on the dial, and there's more. Unlike with most cameras, with the G3 you can set the camera to a super-auto mode (via the menus), which allows you to tweak three aspects of the auto mode, viz. exposure compensation, white balance (warmer or colder), and depth of field. This is great, though when you switch out and back into this mode, you have to reset any changes you've made: it goes back to the default settings.Also very positive is the articulating screen, which makes getting flower shots from ground level very easy. So again, another facility that really makes this camera a delight to use.Image quality isn't as good as my Canon S90. I know the cameras can't really be compared, but truth is, the S90 is a compact, fixed lens camera, which I carry around with me when I'm using the G3, so I get to compare similar shots all the time. The S90 is sharper, often gets a better colour balance, and has a superior screen. It doesn't have an electronic viewfinder, and you can't change lenses. The S90, and its successors the S95 and S100, are also a lot cheaper than the G3.I'm just about happy with the image quality, but know for sure that if I want the best images, I would spend my money on a DSLR like the Nikon D5100, which is a $100 more expensive, but in a different world in terms of speed, ease of use, ergonomics, build quality, viewfinder, battery life, and just about everything else I can think of, except weight.There are some negatives beyond slight reservations about image quality. Like, for instance, the fact that the lenses have an excellent manual focus ring, but -- and this is such a big but! -- you have to dive into menus to shift into manual focus. Ridiculous. You're lying on the ground trying to get a dynamic flower shot; the auto-focus is driving you crazy; so you have to dig into menus to get manual control. This is where we go back to a DSLR, which might even be the same price as the G3, but has the intelligence to give you the switch on the lens or camera. There are other important functions buried in menus, which always irritates me.If you want to use exposure compensation you have to click the rear wheel (not totally pleasant for my fingers), then rotate it. To clear the viewfinder icon that comes up, you click the wheel again, which brings up depth of field tweaking, then click again. Three clicks to cycle through. I find this fiddly and ergonomically a bit lacking. It's also pretty easy to change depth of field by mistake, and vice versa.My main concern is that very portable cameras like the S90, S95, and S100 get better image quality, and if you want a serious camera, for the same money or a little more you buy an entry-level DSLR. These are real cameras for people who know photography. Just little details, a certain fiddliness, the diluted image quality, lack of easy switching to manual focus, the limitations of an electronic view finder, the fact that the screen doesn't dim when you raise the camera to your eye, and other niggling details make me wonder exactly where the G3 fits in and whether it's worth its fairly high price tag.It is light, and when you buy the longer zoom you have an amazingly portable package. That's why I'm hanging onto it. When I fly cheaply I can take little baggage, and this saves on weight in a big way.UPDATE (25 June 2012): I should add that the battery life on this camera is about as bad as I have found. I don't use the LCD screen much and I do little reviewing of my snaps, yet I still get fewer than 120 shots per Panasonic battery (I'd say this battery has been discharged around 25 times). If I did a lot of reviewing this would probably fall to 90. A third-part battery manages about two thirds of this. My Nikon D7000 is at least eight times better in terms of battery life.If you're buying this camera, add two or three batteries to your purchase.", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent micro 4/3 camera", "Author": "R. Thomas", "ReviewID": "RUX3H5M3AJO6R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The image quality is supurb for a micro 4/3 camera. It has enough adjustment to keep a pro happy, including touch screen, and a near flawless auto mode when you need it. My only issue is when you go to take a low light shot, it will only go to ISO 800 automatically, to go higher you must manually adjust it, which wastes time (I bought a Panasonic GX1 to get around this issue, it goes to ISO 1600 automatically). The flash is a bit weak if you are trying to fill a room, but perfect to fill flash a close up flower or child. Auto white balance is a bit cool, but can be adjusted to suit your taste. The screen is bright and sharp, easy to see in the daylight, and swivels and tilts. Images are clean, detailed and smudge free at normal ISO, and noise supression is adjustable. The autofocus is instant and always spot on.But I sold it anyway, because if I am going to carry anything bigger than a Canon S95, I may as well carry a full size DSLR. The APS-C sensor in the DSLR has greater dynamic range and deeper color saturation (especially blacker blacks and whiter whites, noticable in white clouds especially). I can have any camera I want (and have owned dozens) and the one I usually use is an old Sony A300 (even nicer than the F3 or A55). I prefer the older CCD senors, rather than the new CMOS, to me the color is richer and the ability to render subtle tonal range is superior.The final issue is depth of field, which is much more controllable on a full size DSLR, many of the images coming from the G3 (or any micro 4/3 camera) looks the same as from a small point and shoot.If size matters, it is a great choice, if size does not matter, why bother?", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like it", "Author": "Arrowhead", "ReviewID": "R12LDIXFPMSZ4M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent camera and easy to just pick up and use immediately.

Everything is either at a single button away or at a pop-up menu away with minimal button presses.Very customizable for quick control.6. Very compact and light dimensions.7. Very quick focus.  In fact, it is hard to go back to DSLR which is usually slower to focus.The Bad:1. JPEG colours are BAD.  Must use different colour scheme than what comes from the camera.2. No auto-ISO in M mode.  If you want to shoot in a specified Aperture and Shutter speed, you must also select ISO manually.  If you afterwards switch modes you are left with manual ISO.3. Focus does not follow tracked target.  The target is well tracked, but the focus in video can take several seconds to follow.  I find myself frequently half-pressing the shutter to refocus.  Thus it's actually a semi-automatic focus only.4. AF-C is pretty useless and will end up with misfocused shots.5. Won't focus in low light.  If light is not sufficient the camera will simply refuse to try and focus and instead will flash a red square. However, this needs lower light level then just indoor evening lights.6. Dynamic range is limited, and even at a good exposure the blacks are sometimes blocked.  More then I am used to with other cameras.  This is true even in base ISO.
