{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best A-series Canon yet -- worth the upgrade", "Author": "J. Scott Tynes", "ReviewID": "R2DITZJA8XEVYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a long-standing fan of A-series Canons. I started with the A40, went A80, A95, A620, A640, and now this A650 - yes, it's out there, earlier than expected. They all have excelled in picture quality, but each has brought something new to the game. Most improvements between top end models were notable but fairly marginal (ISO increase, bigger screen or MP). My most recent move from the A620 to A640 was one of the smallest. The A640 had higher megapixels than the A620 and a bigger LCD but offered little else besides a black case. Then they went and stuck the SD card in behind the battery door -- a real bummer continued into the A650.The A650, though, is a major reboot for the series. Improvements from the A640: 12MP; image stabilization; a 6x lens that's much improved from any previous A series glass; a higher resolution LCD that's the same size as the old A640 but produces much better quality images; a distance sensing flash that won't blow out subjects close to the camera. This works better than manual flash level method when out of Auto in old A640; there are the DIGIC III improvements: red eye removal tool, face sensor, better shot-to-shot speed, longer battery life; a higher ISO 1600 is there and a 3200 (in lower resolution) plus, in my experience, less noise in the lower ISOs when comparing it to the A640 ISO to ISO; a better viewfinder; a new interface for picture playback shows the grid images but slightly enlarges the chosen picture over the tic-tac-toe -- a nice improvement. Finally, there's a focus check that pulls in the focal box image for quick perusal (still love to have a live histogram), and an \"auto\" ISO that'll bump up the ISO to prevent blurring -- this works, but I prefer to choose (it's selectable off/on). That's a big pile of improvements from one camera to the next. The 6X G-series lens and image stabilization are enough to make the jump but packing in all the rest makes this a worthy move for A640 users.What else? They've changed the button layout a bit, adding a direct ISO button on the back -- nice. They've also added a much-needed gauge for zoom/wide. You can finally see where you are in the zoom range -- very nice and needed. The viewfinder has an expanded reach that's an improvement over the A640 as well, though I rarely compose with the viewfinder since you are still getting 80% or so of the final image. This camera also brings a new sensor, bigger than the A640. This is a relief, since the print size for a jump from 10-12 wouldn't be huge. But squeezing more MP out of the previous sensor would have brought noise. Canon did things one better and upped the size of the sensor and the pictures really sing for the improvement.It maintains the usual A-series pluses: runs on AA batteries (four of them - best for the quickest flash recharge), has easy capacity for add-on lenses for telephoto and wide, plus underwater cases, and has the same wonderful flip out screen of the top-end A series cameras (this time with a much needed pixel count increase -- there's much better resolution here). Also the usual full manual control, the many shooting and `scene' modes (21 of them), and a custom slot for your favorite settings are still there. So far, it seems perfectly in line with the A series consistent reputation for image quality.I did feel the A640 delivered a more contrasty image than the A620. This new A650 produces images more in line with the A620, they feel richer and I feel like the mid-tones are brighter than with the A640 so they don't have the same contrasty out of camera quality of the A640.What's the downside? Well, really only one major caveat here: The build quality. The A620 was a solid machine. The A640 was nice as well, the black case felt good in the hands. The A650 takes a step back here. The design, with the split silver/black casing already looks cheaper than the old A640. But then, flip the zoom button and you can feel it. The lever is lighter and makes a sort of unsatisfying clicking. It doesn't say \"quality.\" And when the camera body is in your hands, it feels cheaper. It weighs a few ounces more than its predecessor does but it's a larger camera. Instead of a 2 oz. bump, you'd expect five or six based on size alone. They obviously didn't skimp on the glass (lens) and the features are well, you'd be hard press to want for anything (aside from RAW support) here. But the body feels truly plastic. Flip the switch on the A640 that moves you from playback to record and do the same on the newly redesigned A650 and you can feel it. The A650 switch feels light and cheap.In addition, and no surprise, there's no native RAW support. The lack of RAW may be a non-issue eventually, as free hacked firmware is available (and likely warranty killing) to get DIGIC II cameras to do RAW. DIGIC III is likely right around the corner. But Canon does so well in the lower ISOs that you get a great image \"in camera.\" And this new machine has dialed back the NR so that there's more detail in the higher ISOs. I can't imagine using ISO3200 (they've dubbed it 'cell phone') but the usability of ISO 800 is remarkable. This is from someone who hates noise and tends to stick with ISO80 whenever possible. It's not an F-series Fuji in the low light, but in some ways, it's better. There's more detail and depth than the Fuji with a bit more noise. But no Fuji has the picture quality at lower ISOs in normal light like a Canon. This A-series takes the best images yet from any A-series camera -- and at 12mp! All the feature improvements are very, very welcome (big zoom and IS) but the fantastic image quality is really the bottom line.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Beyond Outstanding!", "Author": "D. Charles", "ReviewID": "R2VFD64O74N1Z8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first reviewer did such a fantastic job reviewing this camera there is little more I can add.As a professional photographer, I've owned a lot of cameras. I still have and shoot medium and large format film but in the smaller 35mm size, I now shoot nearly 100% digital.  For my small digitals, I own several of the G-series and a couple of the A-Series PowerShot cameras, including the A710IS.  It's a very, very good camera but I did not like the flash, battery life, or the non-flip LCD viewer.Canon fixed the flash, doubled the batteries, and put the flip-LCD in! Also, the new SD-SDHC cards are supported. The San Disc 4GB Extreme III with the card reader is the perfect flash memory card for it too.This is, by a wide margin, the best \"pocketable\" camera available on the market today at any price. The words \"Landmark Product\" come to mind.If the nearly $400 takes your breath away, save up for it and wait until the price drops a bit.For those like me on the perpetual upgrade treadmill spending $400-$700 every year for the incremental features we need and want, we've finally reached that illusive destination!", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Does many things well", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R3MUMROY0756QR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted the tilt/swivel LCD of the A640 but knew that model must soon be upgraded. I waited, and as soon as this A650 came out, I bought it. My recent experience is mostly with a Nikon D50 SLR (and before that, many generations of film SLRs). This purchase is our \"small\" camera, less obtrusive than the big black Nikon, easier to tote on a casual walk, less obvious in a social occasion, easier to smuggle into places where photography is \"not permitted.\"The A650 has exceeded my expectations in many ways. Looking at their images at full resolution on a calibrated monitor, there are only slight differences between the Nikon and the A650: mainly, the A650 betrays a slight blue fringing of high-contrast details in the extreme edges of the frame. This most likely betrays the smaller, cheaper lens design (the lens on the Nikon cost more than the A60 camera!). Aside from this flaw, only noticeable under extreme enlargement, I don't see any difference in sharpness, saturation, or accuracy of color.Although it is small alongside an SLR with zoom lens, the A650 is a chunky handful compared to tiny point-and-shooters from, e.g., Panasonic. It won't fit in a shirt pocket unless you wear a lumberjack's shirt, but it is small enough to get into the hip pocket of my Levi 501's, or into the slash pocket of a windbreaker. Part of the bulk is because it uses 4xAA batteries instead of some small, proprietary battery. This is a huge plus in my view: batteries are available everywhere, and I already have a charger and a box of rechargeable AAs.The menus are clear. The controls are like other Canon Powershot models, so would be familiar to Canon owners. Coming from a different brand, I had to get used to the various buttons, which was not difficult, a testimony to the sensible design of the Canon. Most common options are available from a single \"FUNC SET\" button that pops up a terse menu on the LCD. All the key actions are ready to hand: deleting the most recent image, awkward with some cameras, is quick and easy; setting Macro/Normal/Manual focus, or Flash On/Auto/Off, is also quick.The tilting, swivelling LCD is a great feature! You can store it face-in, so it won't get scratched in a pocket or glovebox. You can turn it completely around to compose a picture of yourself. You can turn it face-down so you can hold the camera high over your head and compose a shot over a crowd, or turn it face-up so you can hold the camera at your side and take stealth shots walking down the street. The LCD is bright, but on a sunny day you must still shade it to read it.This camera even does very decent video! It will put 15 minutes of 640x480/30fps video on a 2GB chip. Recently I needed to record a lot more than that, and the A650 was the only camcorder handy, so I set it to do 320x240/30fps. That format allowed over 45 minutes of recording on a 2GB chip. Using nothing but the naked A650 (no tripod, no external mic) I got acceptable amateur video of a family reunion dinner, capturing speeches and interviews clearly. Using Apple's iMovie and iDVD, I was able to mail out DVDs of the occasion to participants in a few days. The A650 would certainly serve any parent wanting to capture a school play or dance recital.Good image quality, convenient controls, video ability, an LCD that does the hula -- what's not to like? Well, there are a few minor things to complain about.One, the optical viewfinder is near-useless, a disappointment to me as I am used to composing in the optical finder of an SLR. There's no picture info in the finder. It crops a good 10% from the actual image. The barrel of the lens protrudes into the finder image at some zoom ratios. The LCD is the only practical way to compose. The finder is a barely-useful fallback when the ambient light is so high the LCD is unreadable.Two, you zoom by swivelling a lever left or right, and I just can't get it straight whether I push left or right to zoom IN. And, the zoom is hard to control: after I push the lever the wrong way, I push it the other way and quickly overshoot the composition I want, and have to zoom back, jerk, jerk, jerk. There is just no comparison to rotating the zoom ring on the barrel of an SLR lens, which is a smooth and natural way to compose.Three, a camera with this quality of image, and support for aperture- and shutter-priority as well as full manual control (all of which it has) really ought to support RAW. The \"fine\" mode JPGs are indeed good quality but how hard could it be to just NOT process the image data?An irritation that the manual in fact warns about: the in-camera microphone captures every sound of your fingers on the controls. If you zoom during a video, the click-clack of the zoom lever is very audible on the soundtrack.Finally, I have yet to test the A650 in low-light, high-ISO situations. I have hopes that the upgraded \"DIGIC III\" processor will do well, but can't say that it does. Other than these issues, the A650 in daily use is pleasant and comfortable. I expect to get many years and images out of it.", "Date": "October 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Six Mega-Pixels better than Twelve", "Author": "OldEngineer", "ReviewID": "R2NPNDK42WT5EB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After several weeks and 500 photos this seems a fine technically advanced replacement for a trusty A80 which finally died.  With four batteries and a flip out higher-resolution screen I much prefer it to the somewhat similar A710 (now A720) that is in my family.While generally agreeing with all the positive things and extensive details in the reviews written before Thanksgiving, one can wish for what Canon chose not to do.A smaller lens is not the big reason that the A650 images are not up to the quality of a big digital SLR.  Camera people know one problem is the race to have very high pixel counts on the image sensor that has replaced the film.  The prominent 12.1MP in the advertising.The same sized sensor with only 6 MP instead of 12 would result in better pictures.  With fewer pixels you get a bigger cell size for each pixel.  A bigger cell will collect more dim light.  That means a stronger signal, less noise, when you are shooting in moderate light.  Less need for the camera to fuzz the lens's sharp details to conceal the speckles of noise.If you are comfortable with the bulk of this camera that barely fits into a pants pocket, as I am, then this is a very good choice.  However I bought it with a tinge of regret at what might have been.  I could have had better pictures from a camera with less flashy specs.  If more of us feel regret your next camera may have fewer pixels and take better pictures.-----------------Update August 2008, eight months and 8,000 pictures later: This is a very good camera.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Feature rich camera to grab and go", "Author": "HarV eye \"HarV eye\"", "ReviewID": "R1XF7XH2KDS9Y6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this as the small camera when I don't want to tote my DSLR.

It performed well in both cases. Obviously noise at high ISOs, but where very dark, it doesn't show up as much.I feel the construction, while not metal, is still sturdy.

Nelson", "ReviewID": "R1S1LJAOSI3F1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon a650 takes beutiful pictures.  I have a high end, digital SLR as well, and while I can notice differences with larger prints, the image quality is not that far off.  I would say the difference is more due to the lenses than the cameras.  It is not that the lens in the a650 is bad -just that I bought expensive lenses for the SLR.While the price for the a650 may be daunting for a point-and-shoot, please note that the a650 is internally identical to the Canon G9, which cost another $100 and cannot use AA batteries.One caution to note, however, is that this camera is heavy and big.  It weighs close to a pound with batteries and will not fit in you pocket.  Before you buy, go hold the camera.  I almost bought the sd950 for its smaller size, but decided that I could not relay only on rechargible batteries, which is ironic considering my SLR only uses reechargibles and I have never had problems.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good all-around camera", "Author": "Jerry Saperstein", "ReviewID": "R1EHEI06RRURKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted this camera primarily for two features: 1) it uses ordinary AA batteries, 2) the tilt and swivel display.  I really don't like proprietary rechargeble batteries. They always seem to poop out way too soon and, as a result, I wind up carrying several of them. They also impose the burden of needing to be recharged which, in most cases, means carrying yet another gadget, the recharger.  Sometimes I just want the convenience of carrying a camera with AA cells that I can buy anywhere should the need arise.  So the A650 is very appealing to me for that reason alone.  Next big feature is the tilt and swivel screen. You can use the camera at virtually any angle, which if you're feeling creative, is a huge plus, especially if you're old like I am and not quite as supple as you were 40 years ago. The A650 makes it easy for me to get pictures of my toddler grandchild at her level, not five feet up! Used with a QwikPod or similar device, you'll have no trouble creating well composed pictures that include you, which is nice when you are travelling. No need to rely on strangers.  Those are the big features for me - the rest of this camera's assets are frosting on the cake. The image quality is excellent at lower ISO equivalents. As with all point 'n shoot cameras and many DSLRs, as you increase the speed, you increase the noise. Can't be helped.  The zoom range is adequate, though I would rather have a 28mm capability and less telephoto. I suspect, considering what Panasonic, Olympus and Nikon are doing, that a future A model may have both a wider angle at one end and a higher telephoto at the other. The one thing I hope is that they don't get rid of the optical viewfinder or, in the alternative, include an optical LCD viewer as in the new Nikon Coolpix. You can, by the way, get supplementary wide-angle and telephoto lenses.  The video capability of this camera is terrific, which was a big consideration for me. I want to use video for blogging and hobby purposes. The built-in microphone is excellent though, as you might expect, a tad too sensitive to finger noise on the camera. It also, predictably, becomes less than optimal for voice when the speaker is more than a few feet away.  Optical stabilization works well.  Shot-to-shot time feels a bit on the slow side.  The zoom control is a bit too small and zooming is a bit on the sluggish side.  Autofocus is inconsistent. It is usually tack-sharp, but sometimes it starts to hunt and is slow.  Color rendition is excellent.  Battery life with the four AAs is surprisingly good.  The camera is somewhat on the large side and the pocket you put it in had best be large. It is also a bit heavy, coming in at just under a pound.  Available controls are terrific, including full manual operation.  Overall, the A650 is a continuation of the traditionally excellent Canon A series. There are much smaller and lighter cameras available that provide many of the same features. But if you want the convenience of AA batteries, the versatility of a tilt and swivel screen (and an optical viewfinder) and manual controls, the A650 is just about the only game in town in this form factor.Jerry", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Layman's review", "Author": "M", "ReviewID": "R1QUAN3C05CCDH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't go into any technical specs about this camera, previous reviewers who are far more knowledgeable have already done this.I upgraded to this camera from a simple Nikon Coolpix, as I wanted a few more options and better picture quality and a little more performance than the basic coolpix could offer. I also didn't want to go all the way up to a bulky Digital SLR either. This camera bridges the gap between a basic camera and one for advanced users.It's not as big/bulky as the SLR's like the rebel but it isn't a shirt pocket camera like the Elph's either.It has plenty of features to allow you to learn how to take photo's, allowing you to experiment with some of the more manual functions and  not always rely on using the old point and shoot \"auto\" function but for those times you need to, that option is still there to fall back on.The photo quality is excellent and at 12.0MP you get plenty of room to crop your photo's. I would recommend a larger memory card as the one you get with it isn't good for much of anything.This camera is also compatible with the newer SDHC cards and I put in one of the 8Gb cards whis has plenty of storage for photo's and some decent length Mpeg's.It takes 4AA batteries but is not as much of a battery hog as I had thought it would be. The rechargeables are great to have but the new AA lithiums do last quite well under heavy use.Another nice feature, if you are low on power you can turn off the screen (which is a beefy 2.5\" variable angle by the way) and use the viewfinder...a feature other camera's have started to leave out.With some of the other whistles and bells, face detection, Image stabilization and a 6X zoom and this is a solid purchase for the price.All that and its still very user friendly....", "Date": "December 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Verrry happy!", "Author": "Kathy W", "ReviewID": "R11PWO29JEPBB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cannot really talk technical jargon, but I really like it.

It's a little bigger because this fat piece kind of juts out and its a little heavier, but it's a nice camera that takes great pix.It takes AA batteries, which is a Godsend when your power goes and you are somewhere shooting pix.  You can buy AAs anywhere.  You can also buy AA rechargeables if you want.  It has a nice flip out LED screen too.  It's simple to take photos or movies with.  The 6X optical zoom with the range of the lens really lets you get up close and personal with this camera.  I am still getting to know it, but I like it.  It was highly recommended to me.  It is compact, just not as compact as some others.  It is a little bigger than the 5 pixel Minolta I upgraded from.Although not part of the package shown here, mine came with a photo printer that you do not need to hook to a PC, so one is available.

I was back a little further than usual (9th row), so there were 9 rows of heads in front of me.  Not only did I take excellent close up shots but the image stabilizer helps a lot too because Barry moves almost constantly.  The big flip out side screen also helps because you can hold the camera above the heads and still see.  You do not have to look through a tiny view finder. When the concert was over, I folded the camera up, plopped it into my purse, and off I went to the sports bar and hooked up with the other Fanilows.

This Canon 650is is absolutely incredible for close-ups, focusing to within 1cm - yes, ONE CENTIMETER! The Sony came no closer than 10cm. And the quality of these macro shots is incredible as well.Another advantage over Sony is the Canon software, which allows me to operate the camera remotely, from my keyboard, adjusting tricky lighting/exposure situations by seeing them on my large monitor, not the LCD screen on the camera (although that is, in fact, pretty large; also, the flip screen is kind of cool as well).If you're doing a lot of indoor/studio shooting, I recommend the ACK600 AC adapter; you'll spend much more for Duracell AA's than the cost of the adapter.Finally, Canon's function layout is great as well: easy to use, despite the high number of adjustments available.

Not wanting to wait until whenever \"soon\" might be, I took a look on Amazon, and sure enough, the camera had been listed here since November 07! And, for less than $300! I had previously owned a Canon PowerShot camera at 5MP and was extremely happy with it, so I figured I would be happy with this one, and the other reviews here certainly backed that up. When the A650is finally arrived, I was blown away! My earlier PowerShot had the rotating viewscreen, but that is where the similarities ended (other than the overall layout of buttons/icons common to all PowerShot cameras). This camera is simply the best you will find before getting into the high-end, high-priced DSLR cameras. Its relatively wide-angle lens provides a great image, the color depth is spectacular whether shooting at 3MP/5MP/12MP, the rotating viewscreen allows one to get shots from very odd angles that would be impossible with a fixed viewscreen (not to mention that it allows the user to hide the viewscreen so as to avoid scratches when the camera is not in use). As for the zoom, the 6x optical is impressive by itself, but add to that the 4x digital -for a total 24x zoom- and the distances at which one can take detailed photos are often mindboggling. This is enhanced further by a couple layers of image processing handled by the camera's onboard computer, which though the tiniest bit slower than some other cameras, is so powerful as to take my admittedly somewhat shaky hands and the expected image static caused by shooting at extreme zoom and clarify the final image stored on the memory card (SD/SDHC) to near-pristine quality. Regarding memory, it is important to note that this camera IS SDHC (High Capacity) compatible, a feature I highly recommend taking advantage of as any image taken at the full 12MP is likely to range in size from 2 to 4 megabytes; to that end a SanDisk 4 GB Extreme III SDHC Card with MicroMate USB 2.0 Reader (SDSDRX3-4096-A21, Retail Package) combo is a worthwhile investment as the 4GB card will store nearly 2000 images at 12MP and the card reader allows one to move images off a card and onto a computer without draining the camera's batteries (4xAA) in the process. Better still, even with the camera and memory combo together, the total price beats Best Buy's price for the camera alone!

First I didn't like the color it produced even though I should because it's the natural thing.  I just felt like the other cameras I took pictures with had brighter images.  Well after finally reading the manual I figured out how to change the setting to vivid color (you need to do this in the program mode).  Now I also take my pictures in program mode rather than auto.  The colors are super bright and I love it.Second, my PC was taking too long to load the pictures and to load them to Shutterfly was an eternity.  After reading the manual, I realized I could change the megapixel setting to 8MP and even 4MP.  I now take my pictures at 8MP (since I don't plan on making enlargements).The zoom is OUTSTANDING!!!!  I take pictures of things as if I was right there next to things and it focuses nice.  Sometimes if I'm in a hurry I'll get blurred images but it's rare.The light leak issue was not a problem since I bought it from Amazon and the serial # was past all that.I previously had an A620.  The reason why I bought this camera because I loved my A620 to DEATH.  We went on vacation and the lens fell in a puddle of water and that was the end of it.  SAD SAD DAY!!  I still miss that camera because it took PERFECT pictures and the megapixel was 7.1 which was ideal for me.  It's nice to see the A650IS has the same features as the A620 that I loved and some nice improvements (zoom, image stabilization, etc.)I love the speed on these Canon Powershots.  You don't miss that special moment because you have to wait for your camera to be ready.  The battery life on these cameras are also superb to a lot of other manufacturers.  These were some peeves with a camera we were using in the time mine broke and replaced it.  The A650's battery life is INCREDIBLE!!!

Here is what I have found that I like and some things I don't like.  The flip out swiveling LCD lets me EASILY take shots that I just could not make with any standard camera DSLR or not!!!  Canon when will you make a DSLR with this feature??? The auto focusing works so well so I almost never need to use the manual focusing feature unless I want to lock the focus for several shots.  This includes macro work. Well done Canon!  The optics appear to be nearly flawless producing extremely sharp images. Minor faults: The mode selection wheel easily (when you are not expecting it) gets rotated from its desired setting to a different position.  So you may get a surprise when you start taking pictures and find you are not in the mode you wanted/expected.  The exposure mode setting (Evaluative, Center, Spot) does not get saved when you turn the camera off, it always reverts to Evaluative. I usually use spot mode so this is a bit of a pain having to always go reset this.  The custom mode can save this setting but it doesn't seem to allow use of this saved setting with the Aperture Mode.  The manual could use some improvement in the explanation of the custom mode!  The camera still could use some more detail on finish quality.  So far no problems with anything but I wonder if the Mode slection wheel, zoom control, and camera mode switch (Take Pictures/Review Pictures) will last as they \"feel and operate\" cheap.

Battery life is amazing - 400+ shots on a set of AA rechargeables, very good optics for a point and shoot camera and extremely useful vari-angle LCD.Unfortunately Canon's marketing push to squeeze 12 MP into 1/1.7 CCD sensor resulted in extensive digital noise on high ISO settings and slow performance. 1/1.7 CCD sensor is probably the biggest of any point and shoot camera on the market today, but 12 MP is too much even for this relatively large sensor. If Cannon would choose to put 7-8 MP on a sensor of this size, they would probably produce the best P/S digital camera ever made.The build quality of this camera is also below level that one would expect from Canon. The body plastic looks cheap, there are some gaps between body parts, batteries are easily falling out when you try to access the memory card, zoom lever feels loose and it's hard to avoid accidentally pushing menu button when you try to hold the camera with one hand.Two A650IS that I received from Amazon had one burned/stuck CCD pixel clearly visible on every picture taken with the cameras when viewed on a computer, so I had to return them. When I asked if it'd make sense to try to get another replacement, I got the following answer from Amazon: \"...As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We will gladly refund you in full for the return of this item...\"While it could be just a standard customer support answer to a second replacement request, it could also indicate the real widespread problem with burned/stuck pixes on this camera model and poor quality control @ Canon.I did contact Canon tech support and I was told that burned CCD pixels are not normal (even one of them) and that I should send it to Canon for a warranty repair.Quality issues aside, this camera takes excellent pictures in the good lighting conditions and most of the times, with its built in flash, just don't count on it to produce anything useful above and sometimes even at ISO400.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Impressive photos, more options as a highend pointnshoot!", "Author": "J.

I read up on this and the SD950 extensively before I purchased this item. While many call this camera bulky, I think it is perfect as the other SD series cameras are small, and much harder to hold onto. This camera also has features that are above standard point and shoots, making this a higher end. The camera also has the ability to use lens add-ons, and in some cases, filters. So if you want more then a point and shoot, but don't want to pay out for a DSLR, this camera is great. A word on the 12.1 mega pixels, as a previous poster mentioned, the picture quality is only as good as the person taking the picture. With the 12.1, you get 4000 x 3000 resolution pics. On a 11 x 8.5 glossy paper, the pictures look astonishing, but, if you take an out of focus picture, and print it, you get a blurry picture. This camera is easy to use out of the box, though in a few hours of reading, the camera can be utilized to its fuller extent. The different settings and shoot modes can really make a difference.Battery comsuption is highly impressive, I have taken more then 200 pictures, and several minutes of video, and I am still on the same batteries!As for some of the other reviews. The display... wow it is cool. It will rotate the picture for you depending on it's angle. It also has a histogram, with all the other info for those who want to be professional about pics. IF you decide to turn off the display (Using the display button) it will STAY off. Generally it will dsiplay some settings, but the screen will be black. Push the display button, and it will come back on. Most if not all of the buttons, have several functions depending on what functions the camera is set on. It would be wise for anyone who buys the camera, to read the manual before hand. The \"Lens\" problems listed by some I haven't encountered. If you research the light leak problems, Canon will tell you how to get past it, and will fix it. There is fair amount on the problem at sites dedicated to Digital Photography. My camera doesn't have this problem, check the serial number to see if it might have the problem or if the camera has been factory fixed. Info on it is easy to find. E-18... Lens error as some call it. I haven't had this problem, but it can be found on numerous sites as to what it is, what causes it, and how you can fix it should you have problems with Canons support.

A650 is really bulky camera. It's heavy and big compared to A710. You won't carry it in your pocket. Bigger sensor means larger lens to achieve same zoom range as in A710. Also it has 4 AA batteries instead of 2 in A710.Bigger sensor but more pixels so noise is just about the same as in A710: ISO200 is the maximum I can accept. Thanks to image stabilization I shoot at ISO80 most of the time. IS works perfectly.Display quality is really good. Swivel screen really helps.  Screen is not protected well so you have to turn the screen up side down each time you turn off the camera.Photo quality is good with ISO 100 + Large + SuperFine settings. I have an impression that the lens is better than A710's lens.Camera is fast. But I don't like flash charge time and autofocus speed compared to SLR. With 4 AA batteries flash charges a little faster than in A710.Grip is not very comfortable for such a heavy camera but I got accustomed to it.I did not like materials and build quality: my camera has a small chink between two body parts. I don't really care.I don't like weak flash.I don't like new controls behavior (compared to A710).

I'm not a pro by any means but I do get some amazing shots at times.  Now those times are way more frequent since the purchase of this incredible Canon Powershot A650IS!I nabbed this beauty when it was first released and went through the whole purple fringe issue for the recall.  Amazon took it back no problems and later when the new batches came out that didn't have the light leak issues, I reordered it from here again because I simply fell in love with the camera.I had taken it on a trip to Colorado and used it extensively capturing photos and videos from the airplane, at Rocky Mountain National Park, and various other places.  The outdoor shots were amazing, I was able to take a picture of an elk from a far distance away (perhaps 100yards) using the 6x optical zoom.What was great also was that after I snapped the shot, I could preview it using the zoom lever (pardon my non-technical names for actual parts) to zoom in and out on different sections of the image.  Then I can navigate within that photo with that round function dial to see different parts...this worked great because I was able to see just how focused or not the elk was in the photo!  It brought the image of the animal closer to my eyes at that moment than with me physically looking at it.That zoom lever is great for previewing the images in thumbnail size instead of image by image.  I actually didn't know the camera could do that and discovered it by accident...but I'm sure the manual I thumbed through mentioned it somewhere!Video quality was actually very decent for a digital camera when using the standard mode, not the smaller emailable size.  I was able to capture video in lower light conditions that I thought would be impossible.  This of course isn't some super great video camcorder but it does an adequate job for those moments you like a small video too along with pictures.I recently took the camera to the circus and was able to capture some very nice shots!  When I got home, I used the included AV cables to hook my camera up to the tv and was able to show the rest of the family instantly what they had missed out on, both pictures and videos came out well, except for the emailable smaller mode for video, they were not good at all but that's low quality to save space.Speaking of space, I am using a 2gb card and if you're going to be doing photos and videos, you may want to take along a spare...and buy a larger hard drive for your computer because you can't help but snap here and there and film this or that, this camera is fun to use and everyone I've shown the pictures to were impressed by what they saw.Another outstanding quality is the use of the 4 AA batteries!  That alone saved me from the heartache and embarrassment of forgetting to recharge my camera batteries.  I was in such a rush getting ready to go to the circus with my little niece that I forgot to check my battery status.  After two pictures, my camera shut off because of low battery.  I didn't think to bring a spare set so I ventured out to look for batteries.  Luckily I asked one of the circus vendors if they sold batteries and he ended up just giving me a set of 4 AA batteries which of course saved the day!  You can't do that with a proprietary battery just anywhere *cough cough sony*.The flip and swivel screen is very handy and I love that I can close it up to protect my lcd screen from damage and smudges!The included canon software works fine and I like the zoom browser's ability to show the full image specs of each photo I capture on the side panel.Taking stitched photos takes a little practice but I did manage to get some nice panoramic mountainscapes.I have uploaded a few photos in the customer image gallery that I thought would be helpful, the more recent ones being the pictures I took in macro view!  I was really impressed with how close I could get and still get a focused photograph showing all the details!With 12 megapixels, you can crop til your heart's content and still retain a lot of the details that otherwise with other cameras be blurry.I have also figured out through playing with the custom settings how to capture the murals I paint in the dark!  It's nearly impossible to capture photos of my artwork because I do ceiling murals of the starry night sky and those glow in the dark stars does not emit a ton of light and have to be seen in a dark setting.  With this camera, I was able to tinker with settings my older camera didn't have and thus capturing actual photos of my work without manually manipulating them digitally!  I'm a happy gal with this camera!I do notice that the processing time in low light conditions will take a bit longer between shots.  I'm not sure if that's due to the camera processor or the SD card I use.  I've heard the speed of the card would make a difference but I haven't venture as far to the better cards yet.In the end, I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants one that will not only take amazing photos in auto mode but also have the freedom to use other settings to suit ones needs!

I can hand hold shots at full zoom to about 1/60th sec. with little to no blur. For daylight shooting I don't need to go higher than 200 ISO, beyond which image degradation becomes more than I care for. Also, easy contrast management, two click exposure compensation, histogram review, and AA batteries make this a satisfying camera. Why not 5 stars ?

I bought it as a \"grab-and-go\" camera for when I don't want to lug along my DSLR and lenses.  If you are a DSLR owner, then you're probably spoiled by your main camera.  As such, it is not fair to compare it to the A650 IS - it's an apples and oranges comparison. With this in mind, the Canon A650IS is a bargain for what it does: 12MP, 6X zoom, AA batteries, articulating LCD. It can take an 8Gb SDHC card so you'll have plenty of room for stills and movies. As with virtually ALL small digital cameras, noise levels above ISO 200 are quite annoying, but there is software out there that can reduce this noise.  My one pet peeve with this camera is that you need to open the battery door to take out the SD card.The camera does its best work in good daylight.  It's one of the better small digicams out there, and I've tried quite a few.  Now here's something you won't read in most reviews of the Canon A650IS -  this camera is a bit \"dumbed-down\". That is to say, it's distant cousin, the Canon G9, has more flexibility even though it has the virtually the same optics and sensor. I guess that Canon can thereby sell a cheaper camera by intentionally not providing what it provides in the G9.  BUT inquisitive photographers can make their Canon A650IS into a camera that,for example, shoots RAW, has a live histogram, bracketing, and has a full-time battery indicator.  In this light, the A650 IS, a solid small camera as sold, becomes even more worth the price of admission.

Canon confused me with their choice of product lineage - this A650 feels more like the follow-on camera to the G series than the current G9.  I treasure the flip-out-over LCD for its flexibility and protection.  With the self-capping lens I can slip it in a (large) pocket where I couldn't with the G5.  It only lacks raw file capability to make it better than the G series, but with 12 mega-pixels the jpeg images have more detail than my old 5mp raw files did.I haven't analyzed the feature details but the A650 feels easier to use, and display features like a large display of the mode as you switch to it makes it very user friendly.  Its especially helpful using the camera underwater (see review of WP-DC18 housing) as you can be sure of the selected mode without having to look at the top of the camera.I was starting to use the G5 less and less as it was awkward to carry around - this camera will be with me all the time and the shots so far are excellent.  Underwater color correction works OK but as it is a compromise (different depths have varying light characteristics) I'll still be working on them in photoshop.

I loved that camera and knew--after reading thereviews here and checking Consumer Reports--that I'd like the A650IS too.  It is a heftier camera than my oldA95, but it's also much more capable.  I'm not going to give any technical evaluation here because people farmore capable than me have already done that.  So I'll just give some impressions after a few days of use:- This camera is bulkier and heavier than I'd like to carry on a fly fishing trip.  But it's not too bulky if I reallywanted to take pictures on such a trip.  It'd fit in my fishing vest's pockets.  Though, I'd have to re-balancethe contents of my pockets due to the extra weight.  Perhaps I need a smaller camera for fishing trips.- The cover to the battery compartment is trickier to close.  One has to take care and not rush the job.After all, the compartment's cover is made of a rather thin piece of plastic.- I also didn't like the cover for the A/V Out compartment.  It just looks cheap and it doesn't always closeproperly for me.  Luckily, this cover should only be opened when the camera is attached to something elseand not when my hands are unsteady, anxious to take the next shot.- I love the 6x zoom.  What a difference this makes over my A95's 3x zoom!- I was very pleased with the sharpness of the 2.5 inch LCD viewfinder.  I like that it can be tilted--a featureI use a lot.- I read a review from CNET, which said that the next shot delay was \"an arduous 2.8 seconds\"  Having taken over 100 pictures already, I can say that the camera is ready for the next shot almost  instantaneously.  I use 8 GB SDHC, Class 6 type memory.  Perhaps that makes a difference...- The pictures I've taken look great.  Then again, I was already impressed with my 5MP A95's pictures.- The quality of the video it takes is much better than my old camera's.- I'm a novice when it comes to photography, but I love gadgets.  This camera has enough features  built into it so that I'll be busy studying the manual for quite a while.In conclusion, I like this camera.

HOWEVER, after 6 months of owning this camera, the lens started getting stuck outside the body, the shutter would not close, and the inside of the lens attracted condensation.  I live in a very hot and humid environment (Southern Japan) and the camera would do this every time it got humid, which is almost every day.  I persisted on because it took such great pictures.  After 9 months, the LCD screen went black and the whole camera stopped working.  I sent it in to Canon for repair since it is under warranty and they refuse to repair the camera.  First they told me it was \"beyond economically repair\" to fix the camera.  With further calling and questioning, they instead told me that due to \"water damage\" they would not repair the camera because I \"misused\" the device - new excuse.  I have never had water near my camera, let alone ever dropped or misused it in any way.  I am a doctor and use this camera for patient documentation and occasional personal use.  Apparently, my mistake was living in an environment with \"extreme conditions\" which is what humidity is to Canon Cameras and what they replied after further argument.  SO MORALE OF THE STORY is DO NOT buy this camera if you live in a humid environment or even want a camera you can depend on with great customer service in case something does happen.  I am very displeased with the company and their lack of support for their products and in maintaining customer loyalty.

There are very, very few things I can say bad about this camera, so I'll concentrate on the good:  First, I love the battery compartment and operating voltage.  While some camera use 2 or 3 batteries, this camera uses 4 AA batteries.  Also, the voltage it runs on is 4.3.  I am a firm believer in NiMH batteries compared to alkaline or lithium IF AND ONLY IF your device can operate well using them.  I use NiMH batteries almost exclusively now.  Each battery is about 1.2V, so with 4 fully-charged batteries, I'm pushing 4.8 volts.  I have left my batteries in this thing for a month at room temperature with no problems whatsoever.  You have to really try to drain this camera, but it can be done, especially if you use the flash a lot.  I use this camera for my job regularly, and it's never let me down.  Next, the memory capability is great, too.  I am running a 16GB Class 6 Transcend card, and I can record over 1.5 hours of HD video!  I can take over 10,000 photos, too.  It's awesome with the Zoombrowser software.  Just hook up the cable and dowload your photos.  I like Picasa software from Google to edit my photos, too.  Picasa does slow your computer down, so be prepared if you use it.  Forget about the shooting modes--I don't even know how to use them all even tho I have read the manual cover to cover.  I just set it to \"auto\" usually and go.  The manual is really well-written, in my opinion.  I bought the underwater housing for this camera, and it's great, too.  I priced a new one of these cameras the other day on Amazon, and they wanted almost $1000 for this camera.  I couldn't believe it, because I paid about $300 for mine new.  There are several used ones on here for about $400.  It's a good deal for sure at $400, but there may be better values out there for $1000.

In manual mode you can set everything as you would with a Reflex.

The 12 MPx sensor means you can crop part of a picture while keeping a high resolution. The 6x analogic zoom even if not continuos is very good and up to 12x you almost don't see you're in digital mode. As most of the compact cameras the real difference with a Reflex is the quality of pictures at higher ISOs. Up to 200 very good, from 400 the grain is visible, above 400 it's worthy only if you care to have a memory.

The small size (not much larger than my original A40 Powershot).  It is very portable.  The number of pixels (12 Million).  The 6x Zoom. AA Battery use. Close up macro mode (works about 1 inch from the lens).  The LCD Screen that flips out so you can take pictures from unusual angles. The focusing in the Macro Mode really works extremely well as you can see from the pictures I posted!  The only negative thing is the overall look/finish seems slightly below the typical Canon finish. It looks a bit cheaper than I would like.

In this price range, what new compact point and shoot camera has a swing out LCD or an optical viewfinder or an adapter ring for filters and macro-tele-wide angle lenses?  How many new cameras use AA batteries and have easy to use complete manual control?  The A650IS has all that.  Add in an f/2.8 lens for low light, 6x optical zoom, and macro to 1 cm from the front of the lens.  IR sensitivity is reasonable enough that with IR filters it also takes good mono/color IR pics.Drawbacks:  -It may be a bit heavy and bulky for some (personally, I think the bulk helps hand-stabilize the camera).  -Maximum video is VGA (640x480) with only 4x digital zoom.  I find the video to be fine for casual vids.I wish Canon had used the best features of the A650 as a base to build a new compact camera for photo enthusiasts who would like a capable compact camera.

It has the versatility to do what I wanted, and more.First, it is easy to use.  If you don't want to read the instruction book then set to automatic and start taking pictures.  The zoom works very well.  A plus is the swivel LCD screen.  I have two daughters that act up when they see the camera.  This lets me aim and zoom at them without them realizing that I am taking their photos.  At some point read the instructions and you will find better uses.  I have taken beautiful night photos on the night scene setting.Another reason that I bought the camera is that I do family history work.  I have taken photos of old photos and documents that are easier to read when I blow up the image than seeing the original.  In one marathon weekend I took 1300 photos of old documents and photos.  Some of the documents were faded hand written letters from the 1700's that came out very well.  I could tell in the window when one was fuzzy and able to retake it.  I went through 2 sets of batteries but the photos are priceless.  I have also taken photos of gravestones that have come out great.  A plus, I took a wide photo of a cemetery and was happily surprised at how many of the gravestones I was able to easily read when I blew them up.With the 12 MP I am able to blow up photos considerably with great results.I have a camcorder so the video mode was not a reason to purchase this.  However I have found it very useful and have taken a lot of videos at birthday parties, recitals, etc.  The sound quality is also better than I had expected, although it will pick up all of the coughs and \"whispering\" during the recitals.The software makes it convenient to download photos and assigns them into photos my the date that they were taken.The only negative which other reviewers have already mentioned is the flimsy rubber cover over the connection port.  I was concerned that it would not last long.

I watched the price rise to over $400, looked around, and bought it elsewhere for $350 by a supplier who hadn't apparently caught on to the price increase. The $475 that it's selling for today is way too much; you can get an excellent digital slr, the Canon Rebel XSi for $650! Anyone know why the price increased?Pro:Great Canon interface and controls.Lots of great manual controls.Good videos with sound.I like and use the neat hinge on the lcd.Lcd size is sufficient.Histograms on the photo playback.Good optical and digital zoom with a little color-coded bar on the lcd that tells you when you're zoom is getting into an area where your photos could suffer from camera shake.Image stabilization.Cons:Overpriced.The 12 megapixels is overkill. If you need great resolution, why not get a slr with a good lens? I shoot at 5 or 8 mp.Narrow range of aperture compared to a slr. At the small end, it only goes to f8. You can stop it down to f2.8--not bad, I suppose.Photos are noisy at higher ISO numbers.When I was shopping I recall seeing other point-and-shoot Canons for quite a bit less. You might have to drop down a few megapixels, give up image stabilization, and/or the lcd hinge. Sorry, I don't recall the model numbers, but it might be worth looking around.
