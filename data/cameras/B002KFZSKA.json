{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice System, But Motion Sensor Limitation Makes For A Pointless Surveillance Solution", "Author": "Snipes", "ReviewID": "R1OXIGLL2XIT5D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Looking for a small, rather inexpensive camera system to basically monitor the outside of my property at night I settled on this system.  Only a few reviews here about it but it seemed to have all the features I was looking for which were for the most part a wireless system with night vision, and motion censor recording.  I must say up until discovering this system's major flaw I was quite happy.  Picture quality is very good, night vision quality is pretty much on par with lighted picture quality I really noticed no degradation.  Audio quality is pretty good, and the wireless connection was very stable as well, I set a camera up at one end of the house and one in the garage, then went to the other end of the house and upstairs and had no trouble connecting to both cameras.Now the deal breaker, and I think it might be a deal breaker for a lot of people.  The motion sensor capability is quite unless if you plan on using 2 or more cameras.  In setting up a recording schedule with the provided software you are only allowed to use set one camera on motion sensor at a time for every given 2 hour period.  Meaning unless your sitting in front of the screen manually switching through the cameras, the only camera you're going to get anything out of is the one that is scheduled to record at that time, and if you set the system to motion sensor only that one camera selected for that 2 hr time slot will be enabled with motion sensor, all the other cameras are as good as off and are basically useless (unless your sitting at your computer all night switching between cameras!).  This really baffles me why Uniden didn't incorporate motion sensor capability to be enabled on all cameras at the same time, and automatically switch and record when motion is detected on any of the cameras, other systems of this same type and price range seem to have it.  So if you have four cameras running on this system and it's set to motion sensor, you're going to have a 25% chance of recording any motion going on outside your house, that's not acceptable to me, and I don't consider that surveillance! So I'm sending this back and checking out the Lorex LW2702 which Costco sells for about $50 more, it includes automatic motion sensor switching between cameras and quite a few other bonuses.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Uniden UDW20055", "Author": "P.

I was a little hesitant after reading the first negative review, but I figured I had nothing to lose with Amazon's return policy.  I have the cameras mounted outside and the signal is very strong with no interference (distance is about 50-75 feet through a concrete wall).  My house is full of wireless devices (cordless phone and router) and I have no problems.My only grip is that the picture is not as clear as I would like.  This system is great for monitoring your property but is not really suitable for facial identification purposes (i.e. criminal activity).  I use it in conjunction with my driveway alarm.  As soon as my driveway alarm rings I check the Uniden Monitor instead of getting up and rushing to the window.  It is especially useful at night when you do not want to get out of bed every time you hear a noise.  I live on a busy street with young hooligans and it has given me a little piece of mind.The software is very easy to setup and use.  Just load the included software and plug the monitor into your computer's USB port and your off (XP and Vista--NO Windows 7)!  It has a terrific interface and it is simple to schedule it to automatically record.  I purchased a little USB 500GB hard drive to record the video on.  If you want to monitor your house remotely from work or when you are on vacation you can get something like PC Anywhere and leave you PC on and attached to the Uniden Monitor.So if you are looking for a easy to use camera security system, this is the one.  I have purchased many, and this is by far the best.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "A major bummer with the software", "Author": "B. Haines", "ReviewID": "R36DQ65MS2BBI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After having this system up and running for a month, I finally broke down and wrote to customer service.here is the conversation:Your Question :  Will there be a software update to allow the motion sensor to capture video on either (Or all) camera(s)?  Right now with V 5.0.0.302, I can schedule ONE camera to record movement, but if the other camera sees movement it will not record it.----------------------------------------Updated 10/06/2010 03:41 PM:So if the 2 cameras are placed to watch for theft, only one will ever be able to record if there is movement? Doesn't that seem less then useful?Our Solution :  Thank you for using our system.  Unfortunately we have not been told of an update being planned or in the works to allow record any camera that get motion. ----------------------------------------Updated 10/06/2010 04:18 PM:I apologize it does not do what you are looking for it to do. Unfortunately it is not designed to be able to do that kind of recording.You can schedule 1 camera to record.  That scheduled camera can either record constantly during its hour schedule, or can be set to motion capture.  If camera 1, say at the front door is scheduled, and at camera 2 (back door) someone breaks in...Well, hopefully they leave by the front door.  Camera 2 won't catch it.And WHY would you want to buy _more_ cameras.  Seems kind of pointless.  You can't only motion capture the scheduled camera.  I suppose I could put a sign up sheet for someone to steal from my home: Between the hours of 3 and 6AM please break in through the back door, between the hours of 7AM and 11AM please break in the front.I'll probably use this unit to watch for ducks.  I would not buy it again.  I'll have to find a better system, not uniden this time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT: I added notes from the last message from Uniden, and lowed the rating I had put for this product.  I would now rate it at \"Buy something else\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Second Edit: After the THIRD time of not getting a good picture/video of the people breaking into my cars I'm really sick of this camera's software.  I can't set how long it records after it hits an alarm.  Being able to keep recording for 30 to 60 seconds after it hits an alarm would be useful. The sensitivity is 0 to 100, but you can't change it other then using the buttons.  So it either records everything (including the shadows of birds), or doesn't notice someone moving.  The picture at 25' at night is poor, but it's night so what can you do.I would rate it now at: \"Don't buy it.\"", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Smile you're on camera!", "Author": "R. Taylor \"R. Taylor\"", "ReviewID": "R2VL7WA4AIXJPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this for our toddler's bedroom, from Amazon's partner woot! it was a cheaper alternative to the baby monitors, and gave us the ability to achieve multiple angles with the multiple cameras.Number of Cameras Capability: 4 Total, depending on the set/model either comes with 2 or 3 cameras. You can purchase extras, we purchased the UDWC23 to complement our system, which is a portable camera and a rechargeable battery system, I'll review additionally on it's own page.Picture Quality/Daytime: The Product does produce a very clear Daylight or lighted Picture, however not as clear as the manufacturer suggests or places on the packaging or in their ads, kind of like the nummy food on the menu always looks better than it does when they serve it at a restaurant. It's not too far off, but something you should be aware of if you are looking for crystal clarity as a must.The Range: is perfect for our 2500 sq ft home, however it is all about what obstructions you encounter so be sure to check out the placement and the signal before committing to that spot you'd like to monitor.The \"Zoom, pan and tilt\" feature: is a little misleading, it actually does zoom and it does pan and tilt, however only within the range of the actual STILL CAMERA; meaning, the camera is looking at a single area, you press ZOOM and you can tilt and pan around that zoomed area only, the camera doesn't move to another area of the field. What you couldn't see outside of the original location of the camera you aren't going to be able to see without manually moving the camera.Night Vision: This works great, the clarity is better than our first version camera that we owned, however the quality is degraded and you can't make out features of say a person's face unless they are very close to the camera. You will be able to make out generalities and it will be on the most part clear, but even on zoom you couldn't see if a person's eyes are opened or closed, small features on their face may not be discernible.The Remote: is an absolute must to use all the zoom, pan and tilt features, otherwise you must use the software to plugin and utilize these features, in case you lost the remote. Outside of the Zoom features on the remote it handles all the main features the 7\" Monitor has on the face.7 INCH Monitor: The Monitor is a great little gadget, however it is not a sturdy thing and tips over easily so we decided to invest in a TV/Monitor Mount made for 10\" to 27\" TVs, we purchased it from Amazon (I have reviewed this item separately as well) We purchased the VideoSecu Computer Monitor Wall mount bracket for most 10\" to 27 \" TV LCD and Display VESA100/75 ML40B B05. With the bracket we did have to make some minor adjustments because the Uniden Monitor is 7\" and the minimum the bracket is setup for is 10\". There was no drilling involved, I purchased a few 3M Command Adhesive 17040 Sawtooth Picture Hanger brackets to be able to fit the back of the monitor and some velcro for the bottom to ensure it stays on there, and can be removed when I want to take it to another room.The PC Program: The quality on the PC is slightly more degraded than the monitor, but you can record, it will record in intervals, and also has motion sensor capabilities that will set off alarms if you want, for us, we record cute moments our kiddo is playing in her room for later.. we don't use it for a security system.Hope this was helpful, for the price this product can't be beaten & with a few accessories you can have yourself quite a little system for less than $250Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.Thanks for reading!", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera", "Author": "J.

The video monitor is currently being used as a baby monitor. I read a lot of reviews and saw a great deal of negatives with actual baby monitors so went this route instead. I like it when I spend over $200 it last me a couple of years. Knowing I wasn't getting all the bells and whistles the video baby monitors give you I thought I would get piece of mind instead. I have a 5 yr old, 4 yr old, 2 yr old, and a newborn so figured this item will come in handy.Pros:- The range is great I live in a 2900 sq. foot home and can get great signal everywhere. I placed camera outside and every other room I may use the camera in and found no flaws.- IR is great and unless you are expecting HD picture is fine unless you zoom in. Zoom in is not your camera zooming in just monitor moving in closer btw (picure starts looking grainy). Colors are also misrepresented my cherry wood crib appears blue on screen, but not big deal for me.- This unit is incredibly easy to install my wife could have done it, no offense but she has problems getting a menu on her cell phone.-I purchased this unit with an interior camera as well and one good to know is it will work while you are charging, unlike some baby cams.Cons:-My first Negative complaint was not the fault of false advertisement but just an expectation of mine and that is the monitor is not wireless. The monitor must remain connected to an outlet at all times. When you are running around all day this is a good to know non feature.- The volume is incredibly low. 20 it's highest point which seems high but so low I use my old monitor with this monitor to hear if my baby starts to cry.- If the battery dies you get a mere no signal on your screen. Not a big deal but it captures an image of the last available caption which for me is my child sound asleep.- In the instructions it advises you to disconnect any camera not in use. I understand this but it tells me I can't expect to leave it on and catch my kid not cleaning his room or daughter sitting on her little sister without first going in the room and connecting the camera first. Was hoping for convenience but guess that is in the $1000 price range.I like the idea of this camera but my expectations were too high.

More than a camera replacement, to our surprise, Amazon sent us another complete package in advance of us returning the other functioning parts of the system. THAT IS SERVICE, and \"the\" most important thing which is a MUST for purchasing any product online and not from a local store. This customer is a happy camper with Amazon.As to the product, I selected this camera system because I was familiar with the brand name Uniden for some 20 years. We needed a monitoring system on the ranch for two major reasons; 1.) several months ago we had an attack by a pack of hunting killer dogs which somehow got loose (and unknown who the owner is to date) but which took down a mini-jack (miniature donkey) who was given to us as a pet and who kept an angry old mare happy because she thought and treated him like her baby, so she was easier to handle as she was a rescue we took in. The attack was severe and Jack (also his name) lost sight in one eye and was badly scarred and lost a lot of blood. After 3 hours of onsite surgery by a Large Animal Veterinarian who sewed his face back together, we could not administer needles to his eye and face every 4 hours for 30 days to try to save his eye and his life, so our vet transported him to their facility and kept him for over 30 days treating him. We are elated that although he did loose sight in one eye, he has over time regained seeing shadows on that side of his face and he is fully recovered which is amazing. But we do not ever want any other incident or a larger horse to be attacked as we sleep, so amongst other security procedures in place in the front pasture, we wanted to hear and see outside and need to be alerted when sleeping so we can run out quicker this time with guns to save any animal that trauma and any injury.2.) The second reason for the monitoring system is to protect and know when another horse will deliver her foal, which she is about to drop any day now and we want to be there as it is happening to make sure the delivery goes well and to hopefully get some video. The scent will draw other animals.We are pleased with the Uniden product and it does everything as advertised. In daylight, the color and clarity is excellent, and at night, the infra-red feature allows us to see clearly in black and white, inside the barn/stall and one pointing to an outside large 50'x30' paddock she can walk out and eat grass at night. Amazingly the cameras field of view can see that entire area.We take the master display into our bedroom at night and leave it On all night and can now sleep and get rest without worry. If she makes noise, the audio wakes one of us up, we look to see if she is OK and can go back to bed without having to get dressed and walk all the way down just to make sure she is OK as that is what we would and had to do before.The range of the wireless cameras impresses us as we took a chance ordering this product because of the distance from the metal frame barn to the house was great.Surprisingly, IT WORKS!  We've had the unit in place for over 60 days now.Thank You Uniden and Amazon.

I stopped being impressed when I started using the software. The software completely kills the usefulness of the product! It's not that I had any problems installing or configuring it, its just simply that the software is poorly implemented.There are two big problems I have with the software, and a whole host of little annoying problems.1. When the software is running, the included monitor just stays on and displays the text \"USB PC Camera Mode\" which is VERY VERY VERY annoying as the monitor is in my bedroom and it lights up the whole room. My only recourse is to lay the monitor flat on its face. I shouldn't have to do that, not only should you be able to still use the monitor while in PC mode, you should also be able to turn it off.2. Describing this system as a \"Surveilance\" system is false advertising because you can only record one camera at a time in 1 hour chunks. The motion sensing video recording is also useless as it only records about a 3 second chunk every time it detects motion. It doesn't even give you enough time to see who is causing the motion.More:There is no way to access this remotely without simply remote-dektopping the computer it is running onIf you are looking for a simple screen to show 3 live camera feeds to monitor your house, this system is for you, but if you are looking for something to actually catch people doing stuff they shouldn't be (like breaking in to your house) chances are, it won't be on the camera thats being recorded that hour!!!!", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Uniden wireless video surveillance system", "Author": "jreaves", "ReviewID": "R1LJ9X6U3TKK6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This system works on a 64 bit Windows 7 setup.

(although with some skill and some knowhow, you could use this device, a modified PC, and different software to do so, but I'm not going to get into that). However, if you want to put the cameras up to keep an eye on things around and in your house while you're there, this is the PERFECT item for you.First, I'm a Mac user, if you own a Mac and are expecting the software to work, it will not. I do also own a PC. The included software is lackluster and I decided just not to use it. So I'm going forward with this review as a home monitoring system.First, I rigged the cameras up in a non-permanent fashion and moved the receiver to different rooms of my house to make sure that I'd get reception in all the places I anticipated being, then permanently attached the cameras once I made sure the reception worked. The included mounting screws are all right. I'd recommend using some better quality ones if you're that type of person. If you're just going to put them into drywall, they'll be fine, anything else, you'll need better screws.Secondly, I was a bit concerned at first about the posts and the view point of the cameras. You don't have to mount the camera posts vertically from a ceiling. You can mount them at a 90 degree angle on a post or wall and still manipulate the camera to a good view.The included monitor has a clear enough picture to see what's going on. You do occasionally get a flicker in the image. I would just chock this up to the fact that it's wireless. It's not often and frankly, it doesn't really bother me.The night vision on the cameras (UWDC25) is actually quite nice. They'll pick things up at about 20/25 feet, as long as there's nothing in their immediate focal point (i.e.,: a rain gutter, soffit, etc.). If you're looking on expanding and using the indoor camera (UWDC23), the picture and night vision isn't quite as crisp as the indoor/outdoor camera. If you're looking on putting cameras inside and have the space for the bigger one, go with it. There is one additional side note. On the indoor/outdoor camera, when walking in front of it at night, it will make a \"clicking\" noise whereas the indoor camera doesn't do this. I think this has something to do with the motion sensing and the infrared. The click doesn't bother me personally.Please keep this in mind. As with any piece of technology, you have to remember that they require electricity. Most of us don't have electrical outlets on our ceilings or in numerous places outside, so Uniden does add extender cords for the \"outdoor\" cameras, so you can get about 10/12 feet from the outlet. I managed to tuck the cabling into the siding of the house and run the wires out through windows.I've not encountered any issues with my 2.4GHz B/G home network, nor any other wireless equipment in my house.I've been very happy with this system and would recommend it to others.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera for the price", "Author": "Baytraks", "ReviewID": "R1U3MGUK2GPVFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the camera and monitor, but if I could change two things they would be even better.We already had a Uniden indoor camera and portable monitor.

I can set it to step through the four cameras, pausing for five seconds at each location.  It can be set for longer times, but this gives me enough time to see whats there.  You can also set it up to watch all four cameras at once, but pictures are much smaller then.This system has been just what I wanted.Its not a good system for security if your wanting to record your residence while your away from home.  It has some capability for this, but is very limited to what it recordes and for how long.  But, good systems for this type of monitoring are pretty expensive.For what I wanted, and for the price, I have been very satisfied with this system.

She goes down and can't get up by herself due to arthritis every so often.  We've tried baby monitors and they work pretty well but when she's making a noise and we're not sure she's down or not, a video camera seemed like a good idea.  With winter coming on I did not want to have to get dressed every time I thought she was down.  So we figured we'd try this system.  The Uniden system was a breeze to set up and can show her entire 12' x 14' stall from a corner vantage point.  We were unsure how it would work at night as we have no outside lighting and don't like to leave lights on in the barn, but we could see her perfectly even during the darkest nights.  My only issue with the system is that the audio is not very clear.  Unlike the baby monitors we've tried, the sounds are a bit tinny and even a little shrill if she makes a loud noise.  It's not a deal breaker by any means but wanted to mention it.  So far it's worked flawlessly.  I wish we could hook it into our computer somehow so we could access the live video with remote viewing when we are away for the day, but the software does not allow that.  I have experimented with a webcam directed right at the monitor and that's ok, but a direct connection would be better.

The video monitor is currently being used as a baby monitor. I read a lot of reviews and saw a great deal of negatives with actual baby monitors so went this route instead. I like it when I spend over $200 it last me a couple of years. Knowing I wasn't getting all the bells and whistles the video baby monitors give you I thought I would get piece of mind instead. I have a 5 yr old, 4 yr old, 2 yr old, and a newborn so figured this item will come in handy.Pros: - The range is great I live in a 2900 sq. foot home and can get great signal everywhere. I placed camera outside and every other room I may use the camera in and found no flaws. - IR is great  and unless you are expecting HD picture is fine unless you zoom in. Zoom in is not your camera zooming in just monitor moving in closer btw (picure starts looking grainy). Colors are also misrepresented my cherry wood crib appears blue on screen, but not big deal for me. - This unit is incredibly easy to install my wife could have done it, no offense but she has problems getting a menu on her cell phone. -I purchased this unit with an interior camera as well and one good to know is it will work while you are charging, unlike some baby cams.Cons: -My first Negative complaint was not the fault of false advertisement but just an expectation of mine and that is the monitor is not wireless. The monitor must remain connected to an outlet at all times. When you are running around all day this is a good to know non feature. - The volume is incredibly low. 20 it's highest point which seems high but so low I use my old monitor with this monitor to hear if my baby starts to cry. - If the battery dies you get a mere no signal on your screen. Not a big deal but it captures an image of the last available caption which for me is my child sound asleep. - In the instructions it advises you to disconnect any camera not in use. I understand this but it tells me I can't expect to leave it on and catch my kid not cleaning his room or daughter sitting on her little sister without first going in the room and connecting the camera first. Was hoping for convenience but guess that is in the $1000 price range.I like the idea of this camera but my expectations were too high.

I'd say day vision is maybe 60% of the quality of the wired system.  My wired system is a Revo, not high end but not cheap either.I bought this system because I had a need to install cameras on my shop about 150 ft from my house which currently has 8 wired cameras.  It wasn't practical to install wired cameras at that distance, would have to bury cabling etc. and in my experience long outdoor cables make great lightning antennas, knocking out electronics attached to them when lightning hits nearby.  I have lost a Revo camera and the DVR that way already on one long 100ft run indoors through the attic.I have tried other analog video 2.4Ghz camera systems and could not tolerate the interference to/from my wi-fi.This system overcomes that with its spread spectrum capability.I like the fact the small monitor system has a rechargeable battery in the monitor so one can unplug it and carry it around, the larger monitor does not.I do not use the included software as I simply feed the video into my Revo DVR.  The software they supply is clunky and they should be ashamed of it.  I also do not like that the video cuts off the main monitor when it is used to feed an external monitor- Uniden cheaped out there, even the cheapest tv sets still run their screen if external video is used.There is also an issue of the status lights on the camera indicating to a thief when a camera is actually being used.  If he figures this out he can slip by a camera unseen and undetected.

Uniden has a wonderful web site, you can down load the System Software Users Guide, the System User Manual and the Camera Users Manual, even the computer software.  Anyone reading this readily available information would have known ahead of time the systems limitations.  And the limitations are not all that much for a surveillance system in this price class.  Also you should go to Google, click the video search and enter the part number UDW20055.  There are two videos worth viewing and there are more if you click around.  Had reviewers done just a little research they would have known what they were getting and would not have been disappointed.

The system is easy to set up, and the wireless is great! However, it still requires direct power for the camera to operate. Only one camera out of the set comes with an in built rechargeable batter, which allows it to still record for up to 4hrs after it has been disconected from the main power sources. Ultimately the number one flaw and weakness of this set is the fact that only one camera set with motion sensing can record at any giving time. So at night if you get robbed or your car gets broken into there is a good chance that the camera wont record it, except the incident occured infront of the one camera that had the motion sensing enabled.  Howerver I have it connected to my pc, which I can acess from my smart phone and my work computer, so I can always see whats going on in my house no matter where I am in the world.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Only compatible with vista 32 bit !!!!!!!!", "Author": "Adonis 997", "ReviewID": "R2SVIY9GEJ4OSR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Thanks for the info before I wasted my time with this thing.....How old is Vista and how can they not have 64bit support for their damn product...", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002KFZSKA"}}
