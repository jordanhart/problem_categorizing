{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't believe the \"Techies\" that claim to know", "Author": "Dale Chaney", "ReviewID": "RW5DXOCHG6A5U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EasyN \"F\" series cameras are very inexpensive at around $50 each, and are also very functional little devices.  But, they do require a little finesse and tolerance when trying to understand broken English mixed with Mandarin (Chinese).  Simply stated, it is difficult to understand the installation directions and software that comes prepackaged with it.  And, more often than not, installers quickly become disenfranchised when it doesn't work \"out-of-the-box\".  With that in mind, here is a simple tutorial/reference.First, the hardware is actually quite outstanding.  It is functionally a full blown Linux based computer with a camera attached.  With that in mind, consider that when adding 3 cameras to your network, you are actually adding 3 computers, each with a camera and a network connection.  So, complexity quickly increases.This camera includes 2-way panning, 2-way audio, infrared lighting, wired and/or wireless connectivity, image inversion, remote access via smartphone, and remote control via smartphone or web browser, audio and visual detection with optional alarms, MPEG4 compression, and multiple frame rates.  Such stats are unheard of in a consumer grade wireless camera.  To get this kind of functionality in another camera, would cost upwards of twice to five times the money.But, be aware that because this is a \"wireless\" camera, it can place a high demand on your network infrastructure and router.  So, if you are not using a Wireless-N router, or do not have it configured correctly, this camera can deplete your available bandwidth, rendering \"all\" wireless devices, including this camera, buggy/choppy requiring frequent reconnects.  Also, if you are \"sharing\" a wireless channel with your neighbor, you'll quickly become very disenchanted - this is what causes most \"techie\" people to complain loudly.  If you have a smartphone, install the \"WiFi Analyzer\" which will show you any channel conflicts.So, before you attempt to use this camera, make sure that you have sufficient \"N\" bandwidth, and that it is not being used by other \"streamers\".  I highly suggest a 300mbs \"N\" connection using a 300mbs router with a 300mbs NIC (if you don't understand this, do some research first).  And, be aware that multiple cameras compound the need for bandwidth.Alternatively, you might want to consider a \"wired\" connection, as the EasyN includes a connection for it.  Simply connect an RJ45 cable from the camera directly to your router.  If you are short of connections, which is common, you might need to add an additional \"switch\" to your configuration, which is a good option as expansion is nearly always required eventually.--------------------------------------------------------------------The software, is very \"Chinese/foreign\", in that it does not use proper English in its documentation - very common these days.  But that does not diminish what the software can actually do, with a little patience.Here's a list of features that it offers: Up to 81 cameras supported by the software (most of them wired) Unique by-camera configurations (cam-1 ceiling, cam-2 desktop) Image inversion (allows hanging camera upside down on ceiling)  PTZ support (remote Pan, Tilt, Zoom controls) Audio intrusion detection and recording IP based or Serial# based cameras Automatic recording, and automatic triggering  on either Action or ScheduleFinally, the software is a bit buggy.  But, considering the cost of commercial quality software, it's a bargain.  So, the simplest way to describe the package is that it is \"Very functional, but requires a lot of hands-on tinkering to get it to work adequately\".  After you've mastered the software, you'll ask yourself, \"what was so hard initially?\".If you'd prefer the much better commercial software, give \"Blue Iris\" a try, as that's the best available right now.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The camera must be configured as a wired device first, as that is how one specifies it's wireless properties. To do that, you must connect an RJ45 \"WIRE\" from your router to the camera at your desk.  Once that is done, you should use their \"EasyN IP Camera Finder\" in Wizard mode to locate it on your network.  Once located, you can use that same utility to specify your wireless options, such as camera name, IP, port, DNS and the like.  I suggest that if you are not an expert, you simply use their defaults initially.  Be prepared to write down the IP address and port number for future use.  In time, you will find out that you'll need to specify a static IP,instead of a DHCP generated one, as it is best to have a constant IP (note that the Camera Finder displays \"your PC\" info on the left, and the \"camera\" info on the right).  If you're not familiar with defining a static IP, do some research on YouTube to get educated, as that is beyond the scope of this article.Once you have defined an appropriate IP address and related port number, you are ready to go.  Simply use the Camera Finder, and make sure that it has updated the camera with the definition.  Then place the camera where you'd like it long term (i.e. on a shelf, in the living room, etc.).  Be aware, that like all Night Vision cameras if you have it behind a window you will get glare at night, so use some electrical tape to cover the LED's.  You'll rarely need to play with the camera again, once placed.Use your browser to access the camera from anywhere in the world.  Simply type the URL: 192.168.1.xxx:81 (the xxx is the IP on your sub-net, and the \"81\" is the port that you've defined).  This should prompt you for a user-id and optional password.  Simply use \"admin\" without a password if you used the defaults.  It will then request what type of browser that you are using - do a little reading, and come up with an appropriate answer.  Remember to click \"do not show next time\".You should be presented with a display of what your camera \"see's\".  Play with the controls until you understand what they do.  You can't break anything.  Be aware, that the line that begins with \"Preset:\" allows you to predefine up to nine locations that the camera can recall for positioning (the camera defaults to position one when first turned on).  Be aware too, that you might need to adjust the camera so that \"position 1\" is where it should be, when you first power the camera - play with it.This same browser access can be had via a smartphone (Android or Ipod), to view your camera(s).  But, a better choice might be to use \"IP Cam Viewer Free\" as it has support for multiple cameras.---------------------------------------------------------------------Ok, now start the EasyN Super Client, which is the PC based end of the connection. It is the part that allows you to manage the camera, trigger actions, view videos and signal activity.  It is quite simple, yet fully functional.  Don't get overwhelmed, though, as it can be intimidating at first.The client shows the \"current\" camera view on the left, and controls on the right. You can select which camera's view is displayed, as it also lists all cameras that have been defined.In the lower right portion of the camera display (view) are a few icons that provide immediate access.  These are \"audio\", \"record\", \"snapshot\", and \"options\".  They are meant for quick access to specific functions.  Be aware that the \"audio off\" option does not appear to work correctly.Below the list of cameras, is a depiction of various display choices.  Pick one that you like, by clicking on the icon.  There is also an option to display cameras in sequence, should you like to do that.The circular PTZ control allows you to manage the view of the camera(s).  Use this to position the view for specific items of interest.  Note that the center button is actually a \"reset\" function to reposition the camera to the default view seen at power-on.  Use the browser option to predefine the default view and set it as #1.To the right of the PTZ control, are various options that allow you to move the camera lens, such as pan-left/right, pan-up/down, position by preset, and activate audio (be careful, as feedback is an real possibility).  Play with them, and get familiar with what you can do with them.Finally, six buttons allow you to control all cameras, set global options (as opposed to by camera), view captured videos, list trigger dates/times, and set other options.  Again play with them to gain familiarity.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Lastly, the \"Super Client\" is meant to be resident.  It can be specified to start automatically with Windows, remain in the system tray, and run in the background.  If you attempt to close it, it will prompt you to see if you're awake.  Answer appropriately.You can double-click on it when in the tray, and modify everything on the fly.  No need for restarts.Overall, pretty neat, eh?", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "Jon Cunningham", "ReviewID": "R22CRUTG64T455", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: this camera is very easy to use, has over 10 Pre-set positions that are changeable, good quality, camera.  I am running it wireless only and I have had no issues, its been running for over 3 months straight, I have had a couple power outages and I had to change a few settings so it would move to a preset after reinitialization.

My house is on a small hill and I wanted to use the camera to capture video of cars coming and going into my driveway below. However it's really too far away when placing the camera in a window, I would never be able to capture a license plate for example.

Turn out to be it was great. Night vision is better than I expected. 2 ways audio is surpricingly good. All in all the hardware is very good. But the software SUCKS! big time. I have to use IP Camviewer for my phone to monitor all the cameras I have in the system. For Audio and camera control I have to use their program, and it in Chainese. Just have to guess and try buttons to see what happen when you push it. But once you understand it, it work well.

My PS3 and smart TV can pick up signals better than this thing which is saying something since both of those have very cheap parts for intercepting Wifi signals.The features on this camera are a bit complicated to setup but if you pay attention and go through each setting thoroughly then you should have no problem configuring it to what you want.

Jacques", "ReviewID": "R2V9U0AF3CB2RY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this unit to use for security in my home. My intent was to have it alert me by email and/or mobile text when there was movement in my house while also being able to access it remotely via the web.The good news is the camera itself is very well made and delivers a decent clear picture over the web. The bad news is the software used to setup and use the camera absolutely sucks. The included instruction manual is a joke. Setting this thing up to work over wireless is one major chore too. Finding information on the web in English is also a frustrating experience. There are a few YouTube videos on it, but none of them were comprehensive enough to cover anything but the most basic setup.As of today I have still not gotten the wireless connection to work or figured out how to get it to send alerts to my mobile device or email. There is just no reason why it should be that difficult to setup. I have worked in IT for over 15 years and have installed many routers and switches in my day. I have had no problem setting up numerous devices in my home to access my wireless network.I am sure I will eventually get it to work as it should but that will not change my opinion or review of this product. If you want a good remote access camera this thing will work well for you.

The point of this product review is to help the community out with getting this thing set up. The software that comes with this device to find and configure it uses an IP protocol called IPX. This is why so many people are having trouble setting this thing up. When Microsoft released Windows Vista, they discontinued the IPX protocol and canceled support for it. You can configure this camera by either using a Windows XP system or run a virtual machine of Windows XP. There are \"hacks\" for post-Vista systems to run the IPX protocol, but those are a little more advanced. A Goggle search or two can send you down that road if you so desire.

It has only worked about 1 day a week in that time. It drops it's network connection regularly.(It is running from a UPS system) When it does connect, the audio feature is awful, the motors make a constant grinding noise unless the camera is \"parked\" (looking straight down). It can cause interferance with other wireless devices (not FCC compliant)!The instructions for set up are written badly. The \"provided\" web address for online monitoring does not work. Plan on getting a Dyndns.org account for secure remote viewing. Look on the web on you-tube for some good tutorials. You had better have some strong networking skills to keep this camera connected.
