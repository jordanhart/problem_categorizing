I think the tripod should be sold in a DOLLAR store. Butterfly should not carry such items. Tripod and monopod were cheap. In fact, the tripod arrived broken. The remote shutter also arrived inoperable. The bag and HD cable were the best. I haven't tried the filters and lenses, so I cannot comment on them.However, their service was great. After contacting Butterfly on the defective parts, they immediately shipped me a new tripod and remote shutter. These were functional when I tested them. So, they get an excellent for customer responsiveness.My recommendation to Butterfly is to not carry cheap/flimsy tripods. I'd rather pay a little extra and get a sturdy tripod; especially if you've invested money in an expensive camera. The tripods provided in this package are ok for those $100 to $200 cameras.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Im very pleased", "Author": "Camerasleekgeek", "ReviewID": "RUMR5U4BZFR6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice products for the most part, the tripods kinda cheep but i personally dont use a tripod.Back pack was decent i would prefer more security which i just took from my old case. remote is good... i was expecting a large sd card reader but its a mini usb one. the filters work great the florescent filter gives a very red tint to the pictures, the uv and the polarizer are fantastic. i have not yet used the close up one yet but am sure i will as i get more client base. I use all of these with a nikon d5100 and everything works decent with it.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gear products at an amazing price.", "Author": "Brett Good", "ReviewID": "RQOV8TR9ER5YG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently purchased this bundle and for the price you can't beat what you receive.
