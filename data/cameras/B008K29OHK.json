{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is a great try from Samsung but still has room for improvements.", "Author": "Shufeng Wang", "ReviewID": "R31O9NF9Z8NAJ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this piece for my wife and took it to Italy together with my 5D3. It is the first time I put this camera in a real trip, so I do feel a lot difference and record them here when the memory is still fresh. Sorry I am not English native..With mobile phone, you can take picture anywhere and edit and share instantly. However, there is one thing the smartphone can not and will never do, ZOOM. This piece is a smartphone with superzoom lens, 21X zoom, which is nearly a telescope when you wanna record sth far. This feature is very useful when you get chance to try it. This is the first reason that I think the camera is worth to buy. The tele-zoom lens is the only value for small digital cameras, or, you can use your mobile instead..The Android system. When we all enjoy the instant photo taking and sharing, and keep online with friends, why we still stay with a classic camera, a smartphone, and a computer to connect the camera and phone? They are all in one this time, and compact. All setups are as simple as your mobile. Here are what I do with the system: added art effects in real time when taking pictures; record a nice restaurant by taking a picture with GPS tag, and later load this position from the photo into Google map so we can follow the map and go back, all happened by just touching the screen few times; add effects and share photo with friends through IMs and instagram; playing games; using GPS; browsing web; my kid compose the photos and videos into a video stream with music, just on the camera, a lot fun.. The high end hardware. It is true that Nikon do have a android model of digital camera. However, it is small screen, weak CPU, which means data-intense processing such as photo and video editing may be not so fluent. To me, it is more like altering an interface instead of changing an operating system. The advanced hardware is definitely a must, if you want an android camera.. The power charging micro-usb connector. It is true that is micro-usb connector is an important thing to me. This means when you have a lot to shot during the day, including long videos, you will not worry about the power supply any more. This is because you can carry a portable power supply (a large battery, such as my 6000mah Philips) to charge the camera at any time, with a standard usb cable. This external battery will also benefit all your android and apple devices. So for the days in Italy, I never worry about power of this camera. However, I am not saying the battery of this camera is weak, it is enough. For the whole week, there is only one day I definitely I have to charge the camera on our way. When we went back to our hotel that day, the power become 100%, fully charged! I believe you have never had this experience with other cameras..Huge screen with sharp image and instant touching response. very good experience ever to a camera..3G network is a good design, which makes you connected all the time. I mean, in my country, not Italy..Voice phone is not designed and not necessary for this camera, since this Galaxy Camera will shut down after 2hrs standby to save energy as a normal camera. So it will not work as a real phone. Use software to call your friends, such as skype.The improvements needed:1. the lens quality. Actually, it is a good lens for recording and sharing. I am just expecting the lens could be better when comparing to Nikon, canon, Sony(Zeiss) and Panasonic(Leica)2. The ccd is still too small, the size of this Galaxy should have enough room for larger sensor.I am not sure whether I am too strict to this camera since I also have a 5D3. :-)My recommendation is that this camera is worth to buy if your lifestyle is shoot & share, and enjoy the smart system.  If you can live with the image quality of you mobile phone, then this camera is much better than that.A final story, I also took a Sony TX-9 camera for my wife, since she never believe Samsung could build decent cameras! But finally, she never touched the Sony during the whole trip.Thanks for your time.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "great concept, but needs work", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R37894WVFML5JL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Android on a camera is a great idea, and the functionality you get from all those apps is great, as is the fact that images can get automatically uploaded to photo sharing sites.Unfortunately, Samsung's implementation is beset by numerous problems.Foremost, the image quality you get from this camera is comparable to Samsung's $100 low-end digital cameras (e.g., the ST76). That's still better than any cell phone, but given the price, they should have done better.The camera user interface on the phone is usable but somewhat immature and gimmicky. One of the most annoying things about it something seemingly small: you can't tell where you end up when you turn on the camera; after a long wait, you end up in the photo app by default, which means the lens extends, at other times, you just end up in whatever app you were before. This means you constantly have the lens pushing into your hand. Furthermore, many Android apps don't expect anything to happen when they initialize the camera, so they do it frequently, meaning in some apps, the lens retracts and extends frequently.Build quality is poor. The shutter button fell off after a couple of weeks of use. And trying to get support from Samsung is nearly hopeless: first, they referred me to a couple of TV repair places, then they decided the only way to replace the shutter button (probably a $0.10 part that just needs to be pushed back in) is to send in the camera. Camera companies like Canon and Nikon have parts and repair centers available all over the world; with a Samsung camera, if anything breaks during a trip, you're left without a camera.My recommendation: unless you really need Android in a camera right now, wait for the next generation of Android cameras. And I probably won't buy another camera from Samsung; their support may be fine for TVs and cell phones, but cameras are mechanically more complex and are used a lot during travel, and they simply don't have the necessary support for it.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "So-So Picture Quality, Great Cnnectivity", "Author": "Thomas Bernstein", "ReviewID": "R2WN5MYTTW7QAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I was really attracted to the idea of being able to edit and share my pictures without having to upload them to my computer. This camera certainly does that, and does it very very well. I won't go into more detail on that as it is identical in that regard to any smartphone. It also has superb build quality, and feels very solid (though it is also heavy, and probably wouldn't survive much of a fall). The screen on the back is also really great, boasting a bright 720P display that is actually superior to the one on the Galaxy SIII. But as an actual camera, however, it really disappoints. Especially for the price!The biggest reason someone buys a dedicated camera as opposed to using their smartphone's is for the superior image quality, and while this camera's PQ is definitely better than any smartphone's, it's not by much. The biggest issue is its problem with imaging fine detail, which is very noticeable if you crop the picture or print it in any size larger than 8x10. It is especially noticeable if you compare it with a different point and shoot camera like I did (a much cheaper Sony HX20V). It also had issues with capturing accurate colors and tended to have an unnatural cool tint to its pictures. The zoom, despite being a major selling point, was barely even usable past 15X, causing pics to lose a significant amount of detail and look like they were taken with an old flip phone camera (the Sony, on the other hand, gave crisp and beautiful shots at its max 20X zoom). The reason for this is likely a combination of slow shutter speed and poor image stabilization, which brings me to another gripe about the camera: It's slow! More than anything, it is very slow to turn on, taking several seconds (and even longer if it turns on in the Android home screen, which it sometimes does), which can be the difference of capturing that perfect surprise photo or just missing it. Most dedicated point and shoots, by comparison, take just about a second to power on. If the Galaxy Camera, for whatever reason, decides to power itself completely off, it takes closer to 20 seconds to boot up. That is WAY too long for a camera. It would also lag on occasion when switching between shooting modes, which is just as bad for the same reason. The slower shutter speed also means that taking photos of moving objects will almost always leave you with some blur, so if you plan on using this for sporting events, don't bother, especially if you plan on zooming in very far. The camera's low light capability was terrible, though I was expecting as much due to the fact that compact super zoom cameras tend to have very small sensors. Nevertheless, indoor shots were noticeably grainier than my other point and shoot.Now, all that being said, if you don't mind the so-so picture quality, this camera is pretty awesome. I configured mine to automatically upload any photo I took to Dropbox, making them available anywhere on any of my other devices. The camera also has DNLA and other cool connectivity features, which allow me to wirelessly send my photos to my smart TV or other nearby smartphones (I think they have to Galaxy phones, though). You can also send your photos through your email or vice versa, and upload them to Facebook or Picasa (or any other such service), and it's all as easy as you could imagine.Nevertheless, I still ended up returning mine due to the relatively poor PQ for the price point. Obviously you're also paying for the big screen and smartphone features, which adds to the price, but I still expected pictures that at least looked as good as $200 - $250 MSRP camera (I say MSRP because you can find some great cameras on sale that fall into this price range, especially right before they are replaced with a newer version). This camera's PQ, unfortunately, is just below that, and I just couldn't justify the purchase. For some people, though, the PQ will be good enough, and will probably love this camera to death. In that case, I highly recommend this camera! For others who care more about picture quality in their super zoom cameras, the Canon SX280 HS is absolutely awesome, and is one of the fastest point and shoots I've ever used. The Sony HX20V is also great if you can still find it (it is about to be replaced with the HX50V), and I personally prefer its pics over the Canon, though some people might feel differently.I'm hoping that the newer version will either have better PQ or a lower price point. If one of the two happens, I'll definitely pick it up again. It really is a cool camera.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it, but I can see why others may not", "Author": "Russ", "ReviewID": "R1EYLAZBYJSZZT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased mine from at&t; for $499, and it included an extra battery and charger. I'd give it 5 stars if it were a phone, and the battery lasted longer. For DSLR pro photographers, I can imagine criticism, but for an amateur looking for a device that takes incredible high photos and video, to edit, and instantly share on the internet, and also have a smart tablet, you can't go wrong. It can be used as a phone with an app as well. Buyer must keep in mind that what you are buying is a $300 camera, and a $200-$250 wifi smart device. Mine only came with 4gb of internal memory, but Verizon's, and the unlocked versions will give you 8gb. I recommend a spare battery and charger, as it goes fast when used as a tablet. This is a fantastic device, and a fun, unique gadget, although I'm not sure the market is ready for this yet. If you don't need an android device, just buy the Samsung $300 smart camera. It's well worth the money.

I looked it up at Amazon, found this GC100 3G version even unlocked is about $100 less.  I was very suspicious about this deal, but still made the order.The camera arrived as brand new and I am feeling better.  Love the camera and especially the screen, the biggest screen you can find for P&S; camera.  The camera package are printed in Poland language (like samsung.pl)  But the package was sealed very well and definitely not previously opened one.One small problem: the power adapter came with the package does not work: basically it charges very very slow, like 10% overnight.  Called U.S. Samsung CSR and was told to switch to PC USB, then the battery is able to charge to full quickly.  Samsung CSR (in the U.S.) could not find the IMEI# from this camera (I think it's because it's from outside of the U.S.).  But she is nice enough to offer me with a replacement adapter.  Honestly, the adapter looks cheap made, and it's black/odd and does not match with the gorgeous camera white.  I guess it could be swapped to be able to use in the U.S.Before receiving the replacement adapter, I found I can use any USB (iPhone, iPad, computers, etc) to charge it.  So, the adapter issue became a minor issue now.  Then quickly, I found out the battery drains too fast.  I think this could be common issue of an Android system or the battery is too small for this camera.  Using wifi about 30 min, I downloaded and installed some apps, read some news, the battery dropped from 100% to 80%.  Maybe some big downloads like 150M offline GPS maps had some impact.  Then with WIFI on for about 2 hours later (almost doing nothing), the battery dropped to 70%.  Then, I used the offline GPS app to guide me home about 15mins' drive, it dropped to 60%.  Wow!  Seems I will need to keep in charged all the time.  So far, I've not tried battery drain if using camera only but I will do soon.  Hopefully, if I do all tricks to conserve the battery, like turn off wifi, lower display brightness, etc, I will be able to take 350 pictures as in spec.Anyway, bought this camera for it's Android system and the huge screen.  Certainly, it has some downsides comparing to others like Canon/Nikon, but it's just what I need.  I will also need to try out 3G soon to see whether unlocking works or not.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Insane!", "Author": "shibby", "ReviewID": "RBZ6KCRM8JADV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the coolest camera I have ever used in my whole 40 years of living.

I got the International GSM one so that I can buy SIM cards when I travel to have maps and other data access when out of the country.  My Verizon phone is virtually useless outside the country.This camera is pretty big since the screen on the back is as big as my Galaxy Nexus.  The large screen makes it harder to hold since there is very little area to hold it with on the back.  It is very easy to hit the screen accidentally.That said, it is amazing to be able to use it to send emails, use Google Voice and even listen to music or watch Netflix.  I have Google+ automatic photo uploads going, so all my pictures are uploaded automatically as soon as I get to wifi.  Much better than EyeFi, which I could never get working very well.  It should work with Dropbox photo upload as well.The camera app is pretty good, but it has a bit of a strange interface.  It definitely could have been better.  But, it is usable and being able to clearly see the photos after shooting them is nice.

It has a tiny sensor - the same size as that of Sony Cybershot DSC TX20, which is priced at one third of this one, with Carl Zeiss optics and is dust-proof, water-proof and shock-proof (although it has less optical zoom) and is supremely well-made.  Talk of value.  For this camera's street price of $620, you could almost get Sony RX100, the king of pocket camera, or even a real mirrorless or a DSLR.Its photo quality falls short of that of Sony Cybershot series.  The camera is totally mundane and no better than any $100-200 cameras, and the price premium comes solely from the fact that you can share your photos with others anytime anywhere through 3G network.  Big deal.  How can it justify the 3X price difference?  Only the most die-hard Facebook real-time updaters would fall for this feature.  If you need the SIM card and data plan for it, it might as well have a phone capability as well -- but it doesn't. The recent Nokia phones produce similar-quality photos.Samsung sells almost exactly same camera without the 3G data but with wi-fi at $150: Samsung WB150F White 14.2-megapixel Digital Camera (and that one even has a superior Schneider lens whereas this Galaxy Camera has a Samsung lens).  Other differences between the two models are minor - see for yourself. (See http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-WB150F-14-2-megapixel-Digital-Camera/dp/B0072618G0/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1355168946&sr;=1-1&keywords;=Samsung+WB150F+White+14.2-megapixel+Digital+Camera)  If you must somehow share your photos without transferring them to your computer, isn't wi-fi enough?  And yet this Galaxy Camera is 4 times more expensive, and add $10 per month data plan to that.This is the kind of product that comes from shoddy thinking. Samsung should really concentrate on raising the fundamental quality of a camera (IQ etc) rather than throwing in such auxiliary gimmicks to pump up the price.  Some may think one star is too harsh, but I really think Samsung needs to get the message.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great, has plenty of features", "Author": "David Vanslyke \"Dave V\"", "ReviewID": "R1W5WU8ND7BC04", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "so easy to use and can carry only 1 item for email, facebook and even skype.
