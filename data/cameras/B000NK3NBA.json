{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon knows digital", "Author": "citywulf", "ReviewID": "R1VDZTL5DDOZ0T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although my \"big\" camera is a Canon, I went through several cameras before finding this wonderful gem. I was very fond of my seriously outdated Nikon Coolpix, so I tried a new one - every shot was blurry, and I have a very steady hand (years of taking low-light and no-flash shots). I moved on to a Panasonic due to the many features, including awesome 6x zoom and a very handy \"backlight\" option. But the noise, even on as little as ISO 200, was unacceptable. Took a shot at the GE850 with even more features, but found a harsh flash and odd color.Exasperated with the point-and-shoot market, I finally returned to Canon and decided on the 560. I couldn't be happier! It may not have the highest optical zoom, or the most formats (it makes up for the lack of 3:2 with an overlay that allows you to compose a shot within a 3:2 grid, excellent!), or the most modes (although several of the modes on other brands are so specialized - silly even - that they are worthless). But it has what counts - the most-used settings up front on the dial, excellent color representation, the least flash-fallout of any I tried, and exceptional quality even without image stabilization. And unlike the GE, the face recognition works on pets :) This camera does have a Manual setting that allows customized white balance, metering, color options, and exposure compensation.I will not be trading this one in!", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Point and Shoot", "Author": "P. McGuire", "ReviewID": "R23NYMBQZFPFCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had various point and shoots over the last 5 years (mostly Canon and Olympus). After selling my old Olympus SP-350 - I purchased a Canon Rebel XT (DSLR). However, I do a lot of family shoots (birthdays, events, etc...) and didn't want to lug a DSLR around just to take some shots for the grandparents. So I got this little camera. So far, I am *VERY* impressed with it. The Canon A560 takes amazing photos and the number of features are crazy (compared to my past Point and Shoots). Like any other P&S; it is a little slow when using the flash - but a LOT faster than my previous P&S.; I have taken over 50 photos (about 4 hours worth) and I'm on the original AA batteries that came with the camera!!! My old P&S; would suck up 4 AAs (The A560 uses 2 AAs) in less than an hour of shooting. The LCD screen is HUGE. This camera is definitely a keeper. Would recommend this to anyone.My sister bought this exact camera and loves it.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Decent, But Average Camera", "Author": "Cap'n Stoob \"Stoob\"", "ReviewID": "R3359R6LL6832V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is a good compromise in price between the next level up and the lowest level of camera.  However, the imaging chip is the same 1/2.5 CCD as can be found in any other comparable camera.  The main difference is apparently in the DIGIC III chip, which processes the images to make them look good.  Canon has a reputation for solid photography, so I chose this camera to take good photos without having to think a lot about them.Image Quality:  GoodThis camera, in the ISO 80 and 100 range, takes great photos.  In daylight and bright indoor light, it's nice.  At ISO 200, some noise pops up and that's due to the tiny image sensor.  ISO 400 and above are super noisy.  All in all, a decent performance.  However, the color misses a bit of saturation and this can easily be fixed by post-processing.Build Quality:Cheap and plasticky.  The zoom rocker is hard to control in fine steps.  The buttons are well-placed and easy to push.Hand Feel:This camera is a delight to hold, even for people with larger hands.  It has the battery compartment on the right side, so you can really get a hand on it.  Wonderful!Convenience:100% awesome.  It uses cheap SD cards and AA batteries.  This means that you will ALWAYS be able to find batteries in a pinch.  The importance of this cannot be underestimated!  You can also get a cheap set of AA Ni-MH batteries and carry a spare set just in case.  The battery life is great. Where this camera falls a little short is in the case department.  The grip is nice for the hand, but this won't fit slimline bags, at all!Big Flaws:The camera's BIGGEST flaw and the major reason for losing 2 stars.  The screen quality has to be seen to be believed.  You won't believe that it can be as low in sharpness and color as it is!  The screen is almost useless in composing photos, especially since it washes out in bright light with purple vertical bars on the highlight parts.  It's not sharp enough to show you whether something is perfectly in focus, so you have to trust the camera.  It's not viewable in sunlight, at all.  Big minuses to Canon for cutting corners on the most CRITICAL part of the camera!  This screen just doesn't have enough pixels to show the detail from the imaging chip!Another huge flaw is the softness in the zoom lens at 4x.  I turned off digital zoom and took some shots at max zoom.  It looked like I had a thin layer of grease on the lens!  The blurriness is not acceptable for my photos, so I had to keep myself to about 2.5 to 3x zoom, only.The movie mode is OK, but doesn't seem as smooth as offerings from other manufacturers.  The \"smooth\" movie mode takes a tiny (320x240) movie at 60fps, but the playback just makes it look like an old silent movie with the unusual speed.This could have been a 5-star camera with just 100000 more pixels in the LCD screen.  As it is, now, this is just an average camera, but should serve well as a pocket or everyday camera.", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, okay battery life", "Author": "Jay Vessels", "ReviewID": "R59U2JTLQ8MBI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a birthday present for my wife.  She wanted a point-and-shoot digital camera, and the A560 fit the bill.The good:  Big screen -- it's huge compared to many, and very clear.  It's easy to use -- easy to use and understand controls, the zoom is in a great place, and the camera is shaped such that it was easy to hold and shoot.  It takes 2 \"AA\" batteries, which is great since they're available everywhere in a pinch, and rechargeable batteries are cheap.  Most importantly, the pictures look great.The downsides:  The camera's battery life is okay, but not outstanding, which is probably to be expected in AA batteries.  The camera does not come with a case, though Amazon will sell you a Canon case (which I bought) for under $10 at the time of writing.  It comes with a memory card, but it's so small that I think they shouldn't bother.  In low light, it was pretty slow to autofocus.  Once I learn more about the camera, I may be able to get around this.  The only average battery life and included accessories (or lack thereof) kept it from getting 5 stars.  Both are easy to remedy -- carry spare batteries if you're doing heavy shooting, and buy a case and card(s).As an aside, while the camera comes with a CD for Windows and Mac, it's not necessary to install the software.  I use Debian Linux at home, and even though it's not listed as supported in the manual, I had no trouble retrieving pictures from the camera.I would definitely buy this again.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not too bad...not *great*, but not to bad.", "Author": "Schuylercat \"Schuylercat\"", "ReviewID": "R2I16MO7JLOX1P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Kind of difficult to review a point and shoot when my main camera is an Eos 30D.  Still, this bulky, clunky thing does a good job as the vacation/backup camera.I had a little Nikon 6MP that I hated even worse than my ex-wife - still, it was faster and better then the Canon alternative, given this was two years ago.  That camera was stolen off the dock while we were fishing with the kids, and as pissed as I was I have to admit I couldn't wait to start pressing buttons on new cameras.I don't know why this particular camera won me over - there are a dozen others out there that seem just as good - but it got me.  Price, maybe.  The face focus feature actually seems to work, even on my cats and my dog.  And it recovers fairly fast between shots with the flash off, and not too bad with it on - about 6 seconds.  Multi-frame shooting seems to yield about 2 FPS or so, which I like. Auto orientation is a cool feature too.It's FINALLY quick enough for kids.  I've written reams of letters to Canon and Nikon, chastising them for the crap electronics the shoved into older cameras and lag times of up to a second from the press of the button to shutter release.  Older cameras were criminally foul in this regard.  Parents everywhere have suffered through this lunacy with shot after shot of a blurry ear, just seconds after what could have been the best photo ever, because older cameras were pieces of electronic dog crap.Maybe that's what sold me here: I chased my son around the store and kept getting good shots.  The camera recovered, balanced the shot for fluorescent lighting, framed his face with the Face detection feature, and I'd press the button: \"click\"  Shutter lag?  What shutter lag?  Shot after shot.  Slam dunk, for me.On the other side, it's a pig.  Big, bulky, not heavy but a fistful.  For me, though, that's not a serious negative - it makes the camera much easier to hold, even if it's harder to carry.  Battery life seems pretty good - the thing does so well in low light that the batteries last a lot longer than that old Nikon, which sucked batteries dry in minutes.The pics?  Well, what can you say?  7.1 megapixels aren't worth squat unless the sensor is built tight and the images are collected with good color, focus, and clarity.  Overall I'd say it's a vast improvement over cameras just a year old - different modes do things to the colors and focus, but it gathers everything in sharp detail.  I haven't shot it side by side with a Nikon or other, and it can't touch the 30D, but it takes very, very good photos.I've read too many reviews which are based upon this sort of one-sided take - \"I bought it, I like it, so everything else must suck.\"  Seeing as how I bought this before serious side-by-side testing, I can't offer comparisons, but for a father of five who has about ten thousand shots of the back of my kids' heads, this bulky, ugly camera is a revelation.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good value, mostly great photos, easy to use", "Author": "trainer", "ReviewID": "R1MKHUC37KUQU9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My Panasonic Lumix died on vacation, I needed a small camera that took an SD card and either the same battery as the Lumix or AA batteries. I took it out of the box and went hiking and was impressed by the ease of use and the AWESOME macros it took. The only drawback is that it does not have Image Stabilization which is makes for a few fuzzy photos when zooming in of a moving thing like an eagle flying or waterfall at a distance...you have to be VERY steady or use a tripod for those shots. All-in-all, I would NOT go back to the Lumix because it had no viewfinder and in full sun you could not see what you were shooting and it had issues with darkness like in museums (exposure issue). I would recommend this camera to the individual looking for a small size, easy-to-use general user who takes a lot of people photos because of the \"face recognition\" feature to aid in focusing. It is best at macros, absolutely top notch for the person who wants to take photos of flowers or bugs or tiny things. It gives photos a yellow/orange tinge at night indoors under low incandescent lighting which can be adjusted with software. I have looked many months before for a camera and have not found a digital camera that is a better value than the Canon PowerShot a560 camera for the general purpose user that uses SD cards. It is quick to take the shot and with a high quality (fast) SD card, it writes to disk quickly (meaning you press the button and you will not likely miss the shot if you've got a steady hand). For sports shots or moving subjects, I might recommend a camera with a sports shot mode to freeze the subject and with Image Stabilization.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "My first digital", "Author": "Polish Logic", "ReviewID": "R1RY302CK65T2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally bought this camera after doing quite a bit of research. I'm not a pro when it comes to photography, so I didn't need one of those expensive cameras with tons of options. I was merely looking for something that had decent options in terms of settings, high mega-pixels and was compact enough to carry around without having to strap it on your shoulder. Needless to say, this camera fit the bill perfectly. Adding a 2gb card to it gives me about 650 photos on the highest settings. The photo quality is just perfect for my non-professional eye, and I have yet to hear anyone say a negative word about the quality of the shots I've taken. It has enough preset options to take great photos in almost any setting, while also allowing for you to manually set the options for your shots. I was also surprised to see just how nice the videos turned out. Not camcorder quality, but for capturing a few minutes here and a few minutes there, it's more than sufficient. Loading to the computer was also a snap with or without removing the card.Since owning this camera I've recommended it to every one that's been in the market for an upgrade from their cameras of lesser MP's. For the price you can't beat the A560. I'm looking forward to capturing a ton of memories for years to come.", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Camera on the Go.", "Author": "D. J.

I bought a 2 GB. chip for it, so even on the 7.1 setting I could still take over 1000 photos. It was nice to have the 4x zoom lens, that can actually go up to 16x.Before the road trip, I took this to a ballgame, and was able to get better and closer shots of the players at bat, than my friends 35mm camera with a zoom lens.I am very satisfied with this camera.

This camera isn't packed with a lot of features, but the options it does offer are very nice. This camera is so easy to use, and you don't have to go through a million menus to get what you want. You can change the colors (from normal) to black and white, sepia, vivid, or custom color (lets you change the contrast, sharpness, ect.). You can also specify what kind of lighting you are in and it adjusts colors accordingly so the picture doesn't look strange. My favorite though is the Macro setting. This feature lets you take really close up pictures, and they look gorgeous! I've taken numerous pictures of beautiful flowers in my yard, and the pictures turn out even better than I thought they would. Also, when I hold this camera, it doesn't feel like it will slip out of my hand. It's small, but not too small. And not too slim either. Many of my pictures would have turned out much more blurry if I felt like I couldn't really hold onto the camera. Finally, it's very very easy to upload pictures using the software and cord they give you. The software installs quick and easy, and with one click you can have all your pictures you've taken.

After a bad experience with an HP camera, I decided to go for a much nicer camera with the A560. I was certainly rewarded. The A560 is a very reasonably priced camera that takes stunning pictures. Rather than write an overall view, I have decided to break down the different settings (all 10 of them).1) Manual Mode -- This setting doesn't do a ton, as the Canon still uses its autofocus, so you can play with the exposure, colors, and a few filters, but that's pretty much it. For a high quality manual focus camera, be prepared to spend something in the $300 and up range.2) Auto Mode -- This is what I always used. Being a photographer who likes getting quick shots, I didn't switch settings unless I knew the specifics of what I was photographing. Auto mode proved to be very quick in getting shots as there was very little time lag. The fact that this Camera is a Powershot means you never get a bad shot.3) Macro Mode -- This proved to be the most difficult setting, but in the end it always proved worth it. As the only setting which allows a little control over focus (lightly touch the shutter button to focus), this always took a little while to get a good shot as the auto focus would often kick in. Still, the end effect was that this tiny camera produced stunning shots of everything from nature to exotic cars.4) Portrait Mode -- I never really found this setting too important. I always thought that the Auto setting took perfectly fine facial pictures. Still, always nice to know this setting was here.5) Landscape Mode -- Again, I never really felt a need for this setting, but it's still a very nice feature.6) Night Snapshot Mode -- This is great for quick shots, and the lighting is often much better when using this. Be careful not to shake the camera though, as this can be easily blurred.7) Kids and Pets Mode -- Designed for shots of quickly moving people, animals, and everything else, I didn't use this much. Like I said before, the shots seem great even without it.8) Indoor Mode -- Helpful setting for getting nice shots in preferably well lit rooms.9) Night Scene Mode -- Fantastic for getting exquisite night shots, generally best when used to shoot a large amount of space. If you move the camera mid shot you get a stunning and very professional looking blur effect, great for vacation pictures, etc.10) Video Mode -- Last but not least is video mode, one of my favorite features of the camera. This small camera produces decent videos (640x480), a helpful asset to have. For higher quality videos opt for the pricier A570. Still, I thought this setting was very reasonable.That's pretty much everything. The no flash setting is a challenge (you need really steady hands) so let the camera decide about flash for you. The self timer is great and takes just as nice shots as when you're holding it. This is just a very good camera, that's it. One tip though, opt for pricey lithium batteries for this camera. On normal batteries this camera takes few shots. On lithium batteries you can use the same two for months. Those batteries will not only mean less \"why won't it take the picture?\" frustration, but also a happier wallet in the long run.

It was easy to learn for a beginner who didn't want too many options, but I was also able to improve my photography skills by gradually incorporating more of the finer adjustments and settings. I absolutely love this camera. It has served me well.A few CONS to consider, though, are battery life, size, and movie noise. BATTERY LIFE is a problem with many Canon Powershots I've read about, and this one is no exception. You will definitely have to use rechargeable NiMH batteries unless, as one has said, you own stock in an alkaline battery company. Even then, as my camera ages, I've had trouble keeping my camera running for photo shoots. One thing that has helped is a battery monitor from the program CHDK, and I have been able to get the juice I rightfully deserve out of those batteries. AAs are very handy to get and use, but they do have their drawbacks in terms of strength and speed (for flash recharging, etc). The SIZE of the camera may be a drawback to some because this is certainly not a pocket camera. It's solid and has a sturdy hand-grip (which makes it good for precarious one-handed pictures or awkward angles), but, if you're going for stealth or stashing it in your pocket, you're out of luck. Lastly, I've noticed a lot of \"washing machine\" NOISE on VIDEOS (whether played back on the camera or on the computer). This can interfere with sound if the sound of something you're recording isn't pretty loud. If you're not planning on taking many movies, don't consider this a downside. The video itself tends to turn out very nicely.The PROS are numerous, but some things to focus on are the vivid color option, macro mode, and white balance. I think one thing I have used the most is the VIVID COLOR option in My Colors (Manual). It yields great color every time, and it's especially breathtaking for foliage or sunsets. Make your photos stand out from those with a cheap, dull gray cast. This camera takes great pictures all around, but this option bumps it up to incredible. Another thing is MACRO. For those who have tried to take close photos, only to find that they are blurry as all get out, this is a big deal. My first camera didn't have macro, and I frustrated myself so much to try to get a good close-up shot. Macro mode focuses in close for great, sharp pictures almost every time (just don't get too close... at mere millimeters away, you're simply beyond the camera's focusing capabilities. This camera does not have Super-macro as some of the other Powershots do.) This works awesome for bugs, food, rock textures, etc., and it also seemed to help (in my opinion) keep slightly moving objects in focus (my photographic specialty is taking pictures of flowers in the wind. They always seem to be the most beautiful then :P). Thirdly, the ability to change the WHITE BALANCE is vital for professional-looking shots. Ever taken a picture indoors that was way too yellow and dark? Or have you ever been frustrated because you can't capture that perfect color on \"film\"? With its seven options, this Canon makes it easy to switch from indoors to outdoors, from fluorescent to tungsten, or from sunny to cloudy. You can also go for the two extremes of fussiness: auto lighting or custom. In custom, just point at something that should be paper white, and, with a press of a button, you're all set to shoot the colors you really see. All of these things help to boost your skills and offer you more room to be creative and take charge of your photography and turn out better and better photos.Overall, I say it's a very nice beginner to early professional camera. I was able to take fantastic photos with it and learn the ropes to better photography without being overwhelmed by the options this camera had or being held back by a lack of features. I am getting ready to say goodbye to my little Powershot because it is finally beat, after the literally thousands upon thousands of photos I have taken over the years, sometimes under fairly adverse conditions, pushing her to the max to get that perfect shot. (If one photo is good, 10 different ones of the same thing are better, right?)  If a picture says a thousand words, I've got a bookshelf of the best books of all time. And I owe it all to my Canon Powershot A560.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Too bulky for a point-and-shoot", "Author": "Gene", "ReviewID": "R3QOIJUSFVVNO9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I owned this product for 3 years.Pros:-Affordable-Uses AA batteries (very convenient)-Big display screen-Good flash-Good zoomCons:-Drains batteries quickly-Quality of pictures not that sharp for the average joe or experienced photographer-Too bulky for pockets", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poorly engineered and constructed", "Author": "James W.

I took the A560 with me on its \"maiden voyage\" to NYC and snapped hundreds of photos in very different lighting conditions (in daylight, in shadows and at dusk, and at night).  The pictures were bright and colorful on the viewfinder, but when I got home I discovered two things.  One, all of the pictures had VERY poor contrast, on screen and when printed.  Two, the image sensor had bad pixels right in the middle of the sensor!  I should have sent the camera back, but I put my camera away after the trip and forgot about it for a couple months.The next time I needed to take pictures I got out my A560 and discovered the batteries were dead.  No problem, I put in another set of batteries and took pictures of some things I wanted to sell.  I put the camera away, with brand new Duracell batteries in tow, and let it set for another couple months.  Next time I needed to take pictures I found the batteries were dead again.  The camera was sitting in a drawer in my desk at home, at room temperature, the whole time, so why on earth did the camera run them out?  I have since proven beyond any shadow of a doubt that this is a problem with this camera, after wasting a dozen or so pairs of perfectly good batteries.The last straw for me was when the camera stopped recognizing fully charged rechargeable batteries as charged.  I stopped putting regular batteries in this camera because I knew it would waste them, and this morning I put in a set of NiMH AA's right out of my charger, only to find the Canon thought they were \"dead\".  I grabbed another pair, straight from the charger.  Dead.  I got out my voltmeter and measured the batteries.  1.3V right on the money.  I took the batteries and the memory card out of the camera and threw the thing in the trash.  That's it for me!In summary, this camera takes bland photos and wastes batteries.  The bad pixels, poor image contrast and constant problems with the batteries make it more trouble than it's worth.

We went to NYC for vacation and I took a fantastic picture of the statue of liberty from the New Jersey Turnpike. It looked like I was right on Ellis Island.  This upgraded model has a cool new feature where the image automatically changes when you turn your camera vertically to get that \"long standing shot\".  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the menu doesn't seem as easy to use as the first model and the quality of pictures at night could be better. An easy remedy if I took the time to read the manual. This camera really is, take it out of the box, load it up, point and shoot. A GREAT camera for your first digital and TOTALLY worth the money....I spent $120 and got the free rechargable batteries and station (a $40 value) you will NOT see in retail stores.  I crossed checked this camera at Walmart and at Best Buy and they wanted $150-$180.

One thing, which goes for all new cameras...it that you have to committ the time to get to know your product, how it works, settings, etc.  You can't just pull it out of the box and start taking once-in-a-lifetime family vacation pics! I always take out of the box and shoot stationary/fixed objects.  I will shoot my backyard shed from my kitchen door, potted flowers [red] from my front porch, the tree in the parkway, my truck in the driveway, the flag [red/white/blue].  All of these will be taken at different modes and rates of zoom.  At that point I will look at on my pc screen and make adjustments to the settings etc.  If a camera plain out sucks, I bring it back asap!My first digital was a Canon A80 nearly seven years ago which has worked great.  My six year old son [who I grudgingly have to say takes better pics than my wife] is using it as his first digital [he trained on disposables for about 2 yrs.].  I bought this A560 to use on job sites to take before & after construction pics etc.  I wanted something good that would not cost too much since I usually keep it in my work truck.  It takes AA batteries and I have only used hi-end rechargables in it which last a super long time.  With a 2GB card I have it set up to take about 1200 pics, which is way more than I will ever need at one time.  A large card like this is nice when you want to take video clips which this does with sound.  Never had a problem, many of the things that could be improved over the years have [size/battery/processor] to keep up with the market.  I know that canon has a lot of new product in their line-up and that some folks have had mixed reviews with some of their entry level models.  I looked at a few in the price point I paid for this one [$100-150] and some seem \"hollow\" and flimsy.  I am in the process of getting a new camera for my wife and I'm probably going to buy a SD1200-is, it is the least expensive ELPH with the D4 image processor [their most advanced] and at $159.  And like the old A80 and A560 it is solid and feels durable.I have looked at many, many, many... models of cameras over the years from ALL of the major makers.  I like and frequent [...] for excellent reviews, I like to read other end-user reviews also.  I have always choosen the Canon so far for a good balance of price/quality/performance.  Everyones needs are different. And there are some Canon models I definitely would not buy.  I have had/seen friends and family use Sony and Nikon models I really liked but they were the higher end [pricey] compact models.If you can find an A560 less than $100 new or a solid refirb at a good price BUY IT.

It can take very clear, crisp, vivid photos, and the built-in features, such as fireworks mode and foliage mode, I found amazing and became my favorite. However, there is a definite drawback to having this camera for more than a year: THE CASING. The casing on this camera is pretty strong and durable, and can withstand the average \"drop to the floor\" without breaking, but somehow, it seems to make collecting dust a habit on the inside. Near the battery compartment, there is a gap where the door opens that leads straight to the inside of the camera. My camera has collected dust inside the screen, making viewing your photos/videos quite difficult and annoying. The worst place where dust has collected, however, is inside the lens. It has a speck of dust on the inside of the lens, and is impossible for me to remove. Our local camera shop even turned me down when I asked if they could clean it because they said it would just be too difficult. I CANNOT take any photos or videos without there being a black spot just south of the center of the picture, so my camera is pretty much useless at this point. My mom has a new Canon digital camera, too, and her camera is starting to do the same thing as mine, so I know it must be an issue with many Canon digital cameras. I have decided that when I buy a NIKON camera for my next camera, I would throw this one on the cement to see if the annoying speck of dust will break free. I mean, what do I have to lose??? Certainly not an awesome top-of-the-line digital camera.IMAGE QUALITY: 5 StarsVIDEO QUALITY: 3 StarsFEATURES: 5 StarsEASE OF USE: 5 StarsDISPLAY QUALITY: 3 StarsCASING: 0 Stars", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for this price range", "Author": "Christine K", "ReviewID": "R2I0401T3BLMWO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for over 5 years, and it has worked smoothly and taken great pictures the entire time.

I read all the reviews and chose the Canon PowerShot A560 7.  I like the camera, but the instruction manuel is not user-friendly. I had to take a class to find out how to work the camera and even the experienced instructor could not find all the information. Fortunately, he knew enough to help me.  It would be really nice if they assumed you knew nothing and just started at the beginning, identifying each part and telling what it did and how to use it.  The batteries that came with the camera lasted for an extremely short time, but the new ones lasted longer.  However, I would recommend you always keep spare batteries with you, as they do not last a long time. Also the memory chip that comes with the camera only takes about 10 to 12 pictures, so you will need to purchase a new memory chip.Mary Ann (a pre-technology grandma)", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Family Camera", "Author": "ReeCee \"reecee78\"", "ReviewID": "RGMB9982ZTLWB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my family's \"first\" digital camera.

Here's what we like:We leave it on the AUTO setting most of the time, and it does well, especially outdoors, even with the kids in motion.We were surprised at how well it captures details, and the colors are rich.It has a decent zoom.The video comes out well for a \"snapshot\" camera.It is lightweight, but not tiny enough to lose.What we've learned:Turn the LCD off if you want your batteries to last!Play around with the settings for indoor/ low light settings.Overall, this is a nice, consistent camera for capturing family moments, great for the price.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Chris Moir", "ReviewID": "R2XC0C8SB5XMIA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently came back from our vacation where I took a lot of pictures.

Personally I find that the extra size helps take a little better picture because it gives you a better grip and  a more comfortable shooting pose, without having to struggle not to cover either the flash sensor, which will screw up your exposure, or keep fingers out of the picture. It has a nice sized screen and face detection technology seems to work OK.  Also has an actual view finder as a backup which is a must since bright sunshine washes detail out of even the most expensive screen, much less a bargain price camera.  It could probably use  a stabilzation option, but seems to work fine without it, even at 4x optical.  My one gripe is a big one.  This was ordered as a Christmas present, from Amazon itself, and while it got there in a timely manner, the shipping box it was sent in (about the same thickness as a dixie cup), was broken open, and half of the airbag shock absorbers were punctured and hanging out of the carton when it was delivered.  Fortunately the Canon packaging was intact, and the camera undamaged, but it did certainly spoil the surprise long before I got there.  Obviously made it more likely to be stolen in shipping or on the doorstep as well.

We finally bought the rechargables because we were going through them so quickly and even after charging the camera would still say low battery.  UGGH!  I HATE having low batteries all the time!Around the same time, the screen began going \"blank\" at odd times, just completely out of the blue I couldn't see anything.  So I'd turn it on and off and after a few times it would eventually \"magically\" reappear!  UGGH!  I HATE it when the screen doesn't work!Just recently, the lens protector has gotten stuck in the open position, which I guess is better than in the closed position but still... UGGH!

The quality of the pictures is really great, and I love that it has a lot of different features like recording and indoor and outdoor options.  I guess my biggest complain is the battery life which SUCKS!  Now it is to the point where I can put in brand new batteries in it and it will start flashing and beeping the red low battery warning within 10 minutes.  I have no idea what to do about it since I bought it so long ago, and I can't even remember if I had a warranty on it or not.  If you want something cheap that will get you through a year or two then buy it, but if you want it to last you longer then think of getting the upgrade or something totally different.  If it were not for this battery issue the camera would get a 5 star though, hopefully Cannon has fixed it in its newer models.If anyone has any suggestions as to why this battery problem might be happening I would appreciate the feedback, and if it is something I can fix then please let me know.  I no longer have the manual because I have moved 3 times since i bought it and have lost it so please be detailed in your advice.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "David A.

Very good quality pictures & taste in auto exposure priorities.New NiMH batteries R a must.  It won't work at all with old ones.  Has poor battery contact.  Shuffle the batteries and the low battery indicator goes away most of the time.Very high speed continuous exposures.  It can shoot full resolution, full quality frames at 1fps continuously, until the SD card fills up.  It can almost replace an HD movie camera if U like timelapse or have very slow subjects.BTW, it defaults back to single shot mode whenever it's power cycled.  Also the shooting mode icon disappears when exposure is locked, a definite bug.In still mode, there is no manual shutter below 1second and no manual aperture.  U can use the ISO to get some shutter control at the expense of quality.  It tries to take high shutter speed over narrow aperture.  Daylight in ISO 80 gives U over 1/400 at F2.6.  Daylight in ISO 400 gives you 1/2000.  Exposure & focus locking work.In movie mode, there is no ISO control, exposure lock, and zoom is weird.  It uses optical zoom when not recording and digital zoom when recording.  It uses digital zoom on whatever the last optical zoom was when recording video.There is focus lock and exposure offset in movie mode.  Movies are stored as JPEG and probably good enough to replace equivalent priced DV camcorders.  An 8 gig SD card stores 1 hour of its highest quality video.Unfortunately, it sometimes fails to initialize the CCD when powered up on a low battery.

See my review.So I am getting ready to go on vacation again, India this time, and I need to replace the second A520 that decided to quit working. I went to my local big box electronics store to find a new camera. I spent about 2 hours looking at all the contenders. I loath using the LCD to take a picture, leftover from years of using real cameras I guess. So the field is very limited now. Why??? Some nice camera out there but...I gravitate to the Canons. I have used the A20 and A520 so the A560 feels comfortable and familiar, and my wife won't have to learn a new system. Canon also just seems more intuitive in its controls. But I think the lens looks like the one on my piece of garbage A520, but Canon must have fixed the pervasive problem, wouldn't they?I get home and take tons of worthless pictures, turning the camera on and off a lot, just to see if it guits working. This time before I reach a foreign country where getting a replacement is expensive. Camera seems okay. A few days later my beautiful Golden Retriever strikes a stunning pose on our first nice spring day and I grab the camera and snap a shot. @^#%&*@%$ The damn lens cover doesn't open all the way and I miss the shot. Just one time so far but that's how the A520 started. I plan to take it back today.I have been a Canon user for 36 years and I am so pi**ed.I agree with other reviewer problems about slowness. I thought they worked this out too. I also wished they hadn't dropped the aperature and shutter priority exposure modes leaving the user very little control over camera.
