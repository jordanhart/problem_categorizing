I bought it because when I shoot in a sunny day, it is difficult to see the lcd screen to check the picture. Now I can do that without looking for a shadow under a tree!!  Give it a try! Just be careful not to touch your lcd screen with the viewfinder...do it from a half inch above... its because of the metal material of the frame.. it can scratch your lcd.... (4 star rating because of this)", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worked great with Nikon D5100", "Author": "Mario DeMarino", "ReviewID": "RHTE4C30NHG1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a D5100 and I am constantly shooting outside for family events and sometimes customers. This allows me to manually focus better because it magnifies the LCD and eliminates glare completely. I use a plastic attachable screen protector on my D5100 and attached the magnetic frame to that instead of the camera directly which helps with resale. Although I may not look like the coolest person with this attached to my DSLR I know that my video will turn out better because of it.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "RG", "ReviewID": "R143F0CRDPS65H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For a cheap product it does the job and really makes a massive difference when trying to expose and see focus in daylight. I can't shoot without it. However, with the magnet system it does bump off easily and after several weeks of docci shooting, the adhesive of the frame that goes onto the LDC came right off. Now I'm trying to figure what I can use to glue it back without damaging the camera. The other downside is, if you have a flippable LCD you are unable to close it and protect your LCD once the frame is on.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "InHisService \"In His love and service, Sharon\"", "ReviewID": "R1P8BMATCD4NDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a less expensive version of this product a year ago.

The viewfinder is held to the camera via 4 magnets.  I attached the metal to the camera (hard to remove) and then two of the four magnets fell out of the viewfinder the first time I used it.  I have not used it since, but the metal attached to the camera is still there thanks to the adhesive.  I would suggest a higher priced product.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "It does the job.", "Author": "photon", "ReviewID": "R3S8ZMC084L2DE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product has definitly changed the way I use my Cannon 5D. The magnification is x200 which is under the zacuto pro x2.5 or x3 but is largely enough to see if you are in focus. I suggest adding a dot of super glue and filed off the edges to make it fit on the body with out any floating angles that would make the fixation plate slip off. It take 10 min to instal.You could buy the Zacuto for around 10 times the price. with the \"guerilla fixation\" system which looks even stronger. But since this thing is just a piece of plastic with a magnifying glass I think I'll pass... Bottom line if you have a metal file and are a tiny bit of a DIY practice save your bucks to buy lenses.

It comes with a adhesive-backed square that is supposed to stick to the camera, then the viewfinder has a magnet on it that is magnetized to the square. First off, the magnet is not strong enough, and if you bump into it wrong it falls off. This is terrible when you're holding the camera on a large shoulder rig. You can't just bend down and pop it back on. Secondly, the square thing fell off the first day I put it on there. Don't try to save money by buying a cheaper viewfinder.
