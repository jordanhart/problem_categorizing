{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better than Film and not Quite as good", "Author": "Sage Burrows", "ReviewID": "R2VAFDZEKO3RXX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary - the most camera I could find for [the price] in a small hanld held size. Lots of useful features. I am very satisfied with it as an artist tool. For landscapes less lens would be too far away, for blow up pics, less mega-pixels would be to grainy.The Good.Unlike film cameras, this camera produces all hues of the color wheel correctly. It also records a larger range of darks and lights. As an artist I have paid for professional studio shots of my watercolor paintings that are not as good as this camera. These qualities are mostly a function of digital vs. film camera. All camera films have color bias and less value range than what a painting can have. However, even among digital cameras there can be some color bias, this one has perfect balance. Also it can see into shadow areas revealing details better than most film cameras. With 3 meg Pixels it produces 4x6 inch pictures at 340 pdi on a printer, very sharp.  Posters and magazine are printed at 150 dpi for this camera that would be about a 8x10 print, they still look better.It has an amazing macro lens with a tulip icon. I took very close and very sharp pictures of tulips with it. Other subjests may work well, I don't know yet.  It is packed with lots options like White Balance for cloudy days, very helpfull in Seatle.  Other good features are manual focus, noise reduction, and  in low contrst situations  when the autofocus feature is confused it sends out a a flash to see the subject and get a fix, all cameras should have this feature. The not so good.Some low contrast areas have speckles in them at about the grainness level of ISO 400 film.  This is very slight and most people will not notice.  It also may be a factor of the \"PaintShop Pro\" software translation to the HP 1220 printer, because this graininess does not show up on the monitor.Even with 3x optical zoom distant objects like Mt. Rainier show up at about 90 percent of their actual size, though this is  pretty good at this price.  Note 3x optical zoom cameras are not all alike.  I depends on 3 times what size you start with.  A Kodak 3x camera gives a much shaller or distant picture. It comes with out a camera case and a slow battery charger, 13 hrs. But Sony gives you a $20 coupon towards buying a kit with a case, batteries and a fast charger 2hrs. for $40.  You really want to have spare battieries and a charger that recharge them as fast as you can use them up.", "Date": "May 26, 2002"}, {"Title": "Sony Brings Home a Winner!", "Author": "kurlebj \"kurlebj\"", "ReviewID": "R3S9WVG2QOQL5E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After much extensive research, I finally narrowed it down to 2 potential cameras. The P71 from Sony and the Kodak DX4900. Both selling for the same price, so it was a matter of which was the better camera/deal. The Kodak had slightly better resolution and 1 more Megapixel than the Sony, but here's why I chose the Sony: Batteries: The Sony comes with rechargeable batteries and a charger. Kodak comes with alkalines (no charger)The Feel: The Kodak felt cheap. The body is cheap plastic and the buttons and compartments seem easily breakable and far from durable while the Sony had a nice sleek look and a professional quality feel to it.The Features: The Sony comes with a mpeg movie mode (no sound) where the Kodak doesn't have a movie mode at all. So, how do I feel about my choice? Pretty Damn Good.The Sony P71 is a quality camera. There is no question. The design is very similar to the other models from Sony but a little bit slimmer and lighter. The LCD on the back is bright and vivid and the colors look crisp and nice. The pictures I took came out very good. I took the camera into the woods and took some wilderness shots in the middle of the day and the pics came out beautifully. The trees and water, everything looked great. The movie mode is also a very cool feature. While it would have been much better with audio, it is still a very cool feature and can be used for various different things. Also, the movie size is only limited to the size of your memory. (Get a 128mb card!!! I did and it is so worth it) The camera is very easy to use. I didn't even have to read the manual. After monkeying around with the features for about 30-45 minutes, I learned pretty much everything. It has a nice, simple interface. Kudos to Sony for that. There are various different picture effects you can use, such as black and white, Sepia etc. and you, of course, have the option of choosing your prefered resolution. The camera also comes with red-eye reduction and a special feature found only on Sony Cameras, called the AF Illuminator. This feature is very cool because it helps you take pictures in the dark a lot better. Overall, this is a wonderful camera that is easy to use, durable, nice looking and takes quality pictures at high resolution and megapixels with the option of several effects and features. The only reasons I gave this camera 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought the pictures I took in very low light could have been a little brighter, no audio with the movie mode and I've only had the camera for a week, so I don't know about the test of time. But I am very pleased so far.If you're like me, and want a dig cam to have some fun with and take some great pics, but don't want to get a second mortgage on your house to buy it...then look no further than the Sony P71. A quality camera at a quality price.", "Date": "July 28, 2002"}, {"Title": "good camera for an amateur or a more advanced photographer", "Author": "\"makaron\"", "ReviewID": "R2KYNB8BBPVZ3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first problem I noticed after buying the camera, was its hunger for battery power; I used up my batteries in less than 10 minutes (LCD screen turned on). Later on I realized that the reason for this, was the quality of the batteries I used (cheap ones). Finally, I charged up the included Ni-MH AA batteries, and was able to shoot pictures for much longer, even with the LCD screen.As for the resolution, it is very satisfactory for a camera of that price, with that many functions. In fact, I dont even use the maximum size too often, the smaller sizes of the pics are enough for a good quality shot.A good thing about this camera, is that you can use it as both a manual-settings, and an \"idiot-machine\". It has good auto-focus, even in dark areas (with the AF-Illuminator turned on). If you're using autofocus, all you need to do is press the shooting button half way, and in about 2 seconds, the lens will adjust itself, to form clear, sharp pictures. If you want to play around with the settings, you can define the distance between the camera and the object you're photographing.The camera also offers ISO, EV, WHITE BALANCE, FLASH LEVEL, and SHARPNESS settings. So as you can see, you can get many different results with all these settings available.Transfering the pictures to the computer is rather easy. I have WinXP pro, so as soon as I plugged in the included USB cable, the computer recognized it, and automatically installed it. I didn't even have to use the included Driver CD. I also tested it using Win98SE, works good as well, but you will need to use the drivers on the CD. In WinXP, you will be able to use a special wizard which will automatically rename the pictures for you, and put them in a certain folder. In Win98, the camera will appear as a removable-drive (it will also appear in XP) and you will have to copy the pictures manually.One of the reasons I bought this camera, is its size. Sure there are other cameras even smaller, but this one offers great picture quality, and many manual settings (even effects like B&W;, Solarize, Sepia, Invert). I often carry it in my pocket, but you might want to get the carrying case, especially if you want to avoid scratches.A great option available in this camera, is the ability to shoot movies. It offers three resolutions: 160x112, 320x240, and 320(HQX). I dont know what HQX stands for, but it sure improves the quality of the movie. The one thing that really bothers me, is the lack of sound recording while shooting a movie. It's a big minus, but the main reason I bought it was shooting PICTURES, not MOVIES, so I won't complain much.Sony didn't include an AC cable, but instead you will get a battery charger (the batteries they included are rechargeable, so you'll save lots of money). You will also get a cable that will let you view the pictures on a regular TV.Another big minus, is the use of MemoryStick. The reason? It's less popular than other cards, and it's more expensive. Sony includes a 16mb card, just as most other companies. With the lowest picture quality, you will be able to get 240 pictures on this card. Using the highest quality, you will get about 15 shots.Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera, and I recommend it to anyone else interested in more advanced photography.", "Date": "June 26, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, easy to use, yet it does a lot of things", "Author": "Chris Bolger", "ReviewID": "R1FX3BJVZ8A28W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony cyber-shot P71 is an exelent camera. It is extremly easy to use, and yet the things it does is endles. The camera comes with rechargable batteries and charger, an 18 mb card, a wrist strap, and software. There is one thing else that you need. A bigger memory card. There is no backing down from it. I got a 64 mb card, and it is great. I can do movies for about 30 minutes! Although it is not a camcorder, it is so much fun to make movies.I was worried about the picture quality. It turned out that I worried for nothing. 3.2 megapixels is great.All of the controls are in the right place. The zoom is better then I thaught. Since the picture quality goes down when you use digital zoom. the camera tells you when you zoom in over optical zoom, and are now using digital zoom as well. Putting pictures on your computer is easy. I have windows XP home edition, and I find that XP makes it even eaiser to se your pictures. A lot of cameras also need an expensive USB driver for the computer to read yor memory card. But the USB driver is built right into the camera, so you can just hook up tour camera to the computer.

I bought this to 'test the waters', before plunging into Nikon D/Canon EOS D series. Sony DSC P71 is a fabulous camera when it comes to color accuracy, clarity of pictures,ease of use, and good features at this price level. It comes with an international charger and NiMH batteries. Noise at ISO 400 is noticable, yet the indoor night time pics are very warm..Now over to the undesirables..!1. The digital zoom is practically useless. Picture looses clarity. I have disabled this feature. 3x Optical zoom is great.2. 16mb is a joke - suggest you purchase a 64/128 mb.3. The most frustrating thing about this camera is the shutter delay. i.e the time it takes the camera to record the scene after you click. That one+ second seems like an eternity. If you have a two year old, forget taking a good picture in one shot. I usually end up taking up 10 pics to get a couple right. The other 'delay' is between pictures. I am not sure if this problem is isolated to Sony or all digital cameras in general. Just this annoyance has convinced me to put off buying a more expensive digital camera for a while. I switch back to my SLR when this 'delay' gets to me!If delay would not bother you, go for it!

I really struggled between getting the Sony and the Canon S200, but went with Sony because for only  more than the Canon I got 3.2 megapixels and the 3.0 zoom I was looking for. Plus, this camera uses batteries that aren't made by Sony, so I can save money. So far the picture quality is excellent - the colors are very sharp, the pictures are in focus, and my friends and family have been seriously impressed by the quality. I've been using the LCD screen and the viewfinder (the LCD screen is much more accurate), and my batteries don't drain fast; the battery life has amazed me, especially based on what I read about digital cameras and batteries. The computer/USB hookup was easy on my Windows 98 system. I haven't used the movie mode yet, but am really looking forward to movies that can be 30 minutes long with a larger memory stick.

The pictures are incredible, I've had it for a month now and haven't noticed a single problem with any of the pics. Sometimes when using the scene mode, the photos come out a little fuzzy. The manual says it's because the exposure is longer and you should use a tripod. It'll be fine if you just find a stable surface to put it on. This camara also rules because it so sturdy. I dropped it onto a marble floor from about five feet. Just snapped the lens barrel back into place and it worked perfectly. If you don't have a USB port on your computer like me (I have a really old computer), you can by the Sony floppy disc adapter, insert the memory stick, and use it just like a regular floppy disk.

We used it today for pictures while we were hiking. Some pics under redwoods were a bit dark, but a little adjusting in Photoshop worked wonders. Almost all of the pics are perfect the way they are. The controls are easy to use. The batteries seem to last quite a while. We haven't run out of battery power yet, so I don't know how long they will last. I took about a hundred pics while testing it over several hours, the battery display was still at a half. The included charger is slow, so we're going to get the starter kit. ASIN: B000066HU8 The tripod mount is metal, our old camera had a plastic one...which got stripped easily. The eyepiece helps save battery power , and also helps with taking pics in poor lighting conditions when we can't see the screen too well.

A friend sent me that link, and it was invaluable in trying to compare multiple models, once I had decided on a Sony. It's especially helpful when deciding on whether to opt for features like \"movies\", optical zoom settings, and so forth.I do *not* regret buying a Sony camera, since it is wonderful to pop out the Memory Stick, pop it into my Vaio laptop and have immediate access to the pictures - so much easier than the typical connect-the-camera and transfer-the-pictures routine.Since getting this camera, I find it's much harder to navigate menus than the previous digital camera I had (Kodak DC4800). The compact size, long battery life, and Memory Stick feature make this model well worth it!Also, you should absolutely plan on at least a 64MB Memory Stick if you are having your shots developed by Ofoto or similar, since you'll want the high/fine resolution for prints. The 16MB Memory Stick that is included with the unit is not nearly large enough, holding only about 9 high-res pictures.This model, if you get it at around ($$$), is the perfect combination of features, size (it's small and easy to carry), and price.

It appears pretty well made, though the power switch is often hard to activate and as a result, I've missed some quick shots I could have taken with my Olympus 2100 or my Canon S110. In addition, I find the control labels and the viewfinder text to be smaller than any other camera I've had, making it a challenge to pick the right setting at times. Picture quality has been good, both in daylight and with the flash, and the subject illuminator works quite well at anything less than 6 feet (making the flash unnecessary). The 3 megapixel resolution is excellent for enlargements up to and including 11\" x 14\", though I rarely shoot over 1 megapixel (more than enough for email, website posting and 4\" x 6\" printing). The 3X true optical zoom works well, as does the quick-time movie feature (though the latter lacks sound, something you might expect at this price).

Chen \"wahoodude23\"", "ReviewID": "R2GY3BGJ7V3AJR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sony has just about infiltrated every electronic marketplace possible and the digital camera sector is no exception. When I was researching to buy a camera, it came down to the Canon A40 vs. the Sony DSC P71. I went with the Sony because it was smaller and I didn't want to carry around the larger Canon. I wonder now if I made a mistake as Canon cameras are constantly being raved about.The P71 being my first digital camera it would be unfair to say I was disappointed. It has a decent zoom 3x Optical and 2x digital. The form factor of the camera is a huge plus. It's very small and light and easy to carry in a jacket pocket. The LCD is 1.5\" more than large enough to see images clearly. The 3.2 megapixels has allowed me to develop beautiful, clear 5 x 7 photos. Even the 8 x 10 pictures come out very well.The strength of Sony digital cameras lies in taking outdoor pictures. The colors in natural sunlight are vibrant and clear. The pictures taken outdoors always come out beautiful - especially in areas where flowers, trees, and grass are present.I have seen very few digital cameras that take nicer outdoor pictures than the Sony P71.The navigation is very intuitive even if the buttons are a little small. Sometimes I find it hard to find the center \"ok\" button - I often accidentally slip my finger to the right or left. When going through pictures taken already, the preview images render very quickly on the LCD. The camera offer a plethora of options for shutter speed, contrasting, picture quality and resolution, as well as view. Battery life is good. I can go through a 64 MB memory stick at high resolution on one set of batteries (and flash). Sony also provides a free set(2) of rechargeable batteries and a charger with this camera. This is a very very nice addition and accessory for this price. I bought an extra set of rechargeable batteries to keep as a spare (one set always charges while the other set is being used).Also provided is a USB cable to hook up to your computer to download images. This is an extremely easy set up with Windows XP - just plug the USB cable into your computer and camera and XP automatically recognizes your new hardware. You don't need to install the provided software if your computer already has a default picuture viewer.Now the reasons this camera received just 3 stars:1) Remember how I mentioned that this camera takes great outdoor pictures? Well as great as the outdoor pictures are, the indoor pictures are as equally horrible. I don't know if it's the flash or Sony's interpretation of artificial light, but every single indoor picture is dark with an orange tint. They are clear, but the coloring is always off. It's like I'm looking at pictures through sunglasses.2) I wish Sony would have configured this camera to leave the flash on when I turn it on. The default setting for the flash is always \"off\" so when you turn the flash on and the camera is idle for a minute, it turns itself off and sets the flash to the off position. This wouldn't be annoying if it didn't take the camera so long to re-initiate the flash. It takes a good 5-7 seconds to re-initiate. Furthermore, what would make most sense would be if the camera just sensed when the flash was needed and turned it on itself. That's what most cameras do.So there you have it - a layman's review of the Sony P71. I'm not a hobbyist or a professional photographer, I just use the camera for fun to basically record memories. The Sony P71 is an decent camera. If you take a lot of indoor pictures, stay away from it, otherwise, it will serve its purpose.", "Date": "December 31, 2003"}, {"Title": "Another Sony camera", "Author": "\"amnasus\"", "ReviewID": "R1PW3VGZKMJ5DM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've received my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P71 today.

DSC-P71 is a much more lightweight and compact camera.  It has 3.2 MP photo quality.  A good number.  What's impressive is that it uses 2 AA Nickel-Metal baterries - small rechargeable batteries can last roughly an hour in full function.  It comes with a battery charger too!  What is disappointing about this camera is that the photo files are so compressed (186kb with Fine quality) that they don't look good on my computer screen, nor do they look impressive on prints.  For Pete's sake, this is a 3.2 Mega Pixel camera, why wouldn't Sony let it produce uncompressed photos files?  Another disappointment: the camera does not come with an AC-adopter.  You will have to buy it separately. ... Another big Q for Sony, why wouldn't you include the AC-adopter?  I have one more disappointment: the lighting of this camera is poorer than my initial expectation.  I only tested indoor photos, but they (not including close-up photos) look a bit dull although supported with good lighting and with the camera set to the highest exposure.  I am not a professional, but I think this camera is better suited for bright outdoor photo taking.  I also tried the Macro, well, you cannot position your camera too close to the subject or else it will just become blurry. Well, it seems I have more cons than pros for this camera.  My take on it is, I will keep it.  Like I said, it's small, much smaller than my bulky Marvica CCD1000.  It's the size and batteries that matter.  For some reason, I am a Sony fan.

Picture/Color quality is exceptional in my opinion. I print amazing pictures with the Epson 785 model. Both support Epsons \"print image matching\" which saves the image specific info with the picture and pipes it to the printer for crisp and clear prints. Focus works well.  Static Focus can be set for a specified distance, or auto focus for either the center of your subject, or use multi points of focus.  In darker settings (and closer range) you can use the built in illuminator to help the camera find your focal point(s). Also, download of picutres is quick through USB.

This may be caused by a setting that I have not set properly and/or it may be common among digital camera's (expecially using auto focus). I have learned to anticipate picture perfect moments but still would prefer that the image is captured the second I click the shutter, not a half or one second later.In all, Great Camera for the price.", "Date": "January 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "SWEET!", "Author": "B.

I've used it for everything.It's good at general purpose shots in good outdoor light.  By which I mean your bog standard bunch of people squinting slightly in the sun.  The lens is pretty hopeless at processing other light - in particular, extremeley bright sunlight, indoors light (especially artificial light - so forget any useful night shots).  As for demanding conditions like a single spotlight or a candle flame - forget it.  It's also quite poor at macros - you have to focus for ages to avoid the fuzzes, and even then I've found it best to take the picture some way out and then zoom in and trim.And does anyone else have a gripe with the entirely useless Sony explodingly-bright flash (even on its loweste setting)??!That said, I've managed to take some crystal clear shots with exquisite detailing in *just* the right conditions and lighting with much careful focussing and framing.A classic case of a poor workman blaming his tools perhaps! but I've had a much better experience with my DSC-S70 with its lovely Zeiss lens, for example.So in summary a nice general purpose point-and-shoot for acceptable but not pin-sharp snaps of your bunch standing around after a birthday lunch - but not if you want to get any fancier than that.", "Date": "June 30, 2003"}, {"Title": "Cybershots take great pix", "Author": "Snap, Crackle and Pop", "ReviewID": "R2IZO92TINFROP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I get great pix.

The build quality is superb. The battery & memory stick covers are spring loaded and snap into place snugly. I know alot more digicams are made of chic stainless steel now, but the silver plastic this camera is made of still feels sturdy IMO. The tripod mount is thankfully made of metal. The camera is well balanced and is comfortable to use. It's easy to grip & hold and 1 handed shooting is no sweat. The LCD is the sharpest and brightest I've seen(I've used an Canon A20 & Fujifil 2650 - no comparison). The menu's are easy to navigate, and almost all options are less than 2 menus deep. The thumbpad on the back of the camera is used to navigate menus in menu mode. When in shooting mode it provides a VERY handy \"view last picture\", flash on/off/auto, self-timer, & macro mode. All controls are easily accesible and seem very intuitive to me. The 3x zoom is very responsive & precise. No lens cover is needed because lens protectors automatically close.Image quality is excellent. When viewed on your monitor, the details & sharpness is extraordinary. I took a gag shot of a friends open mouth full of brocolli she was chewing and when I viewed the shot later, I could see incredible detail in the brocolli, down to each stalk. Color is very accurate in most situations. Outdoor shooting produced superb images. Shooting at night maybe produce images with slightly noticable noise sometimes. Shooting in cold weather & when the camera is first turned on may eliminate most of the noise. Incandescent light can cast a yellow tint and fluorescent lighting can cast a green tint on images, as with most digicam.The auto settings is accurate 99% of the time in my experience. The camera offers some manual controls(ISO, exposure comp, white balance), but it lacks an adjustable shutter speed. The night scene option will keep the shutter open for up to 2 seconds. To take pictures in brighter conditions with longer shutter times(to induce blurring or whatnot), I use the night option and lock the auto focus on a dark area by pressing the button halfway down. I then aim at my original shot and press it the rest of the way.Overall I'd say this camera is almost unrivaled in it's price range. The Canon Powershot A20 & Fujifilm Finepix 2650, althought $...-$... cheaper, comes nowhere close to the build & image quality. I have yet to use the Fujifilm Finepix 3800 which is in the same price range as the P-71, but I've heard that that camera is an excellent buy. Too bad it wasn't available when I purchased my P-71 or I might be writing about a Fuji :).", "Date": "April 8, 2003"}, {"Title": "Camera is nice - software is lame", "Author": "Stephen K.
