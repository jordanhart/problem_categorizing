I bought a Canon EOS-1Ds 11.1 Megapixel camera body. Out of necessity I had to buy a set of EF lenses as well. I spent this years toy budget on just one purchase, but then THIS IS NOT TOY!My last Sony was a F828 and before that a P10. The F828 is a great consumer product for the price, but it actually made me do the leap as good as it is, as it brought back my spirit for creating a REALLY good picture. I started to spend so much time to get to the right photo spot at the right time, that I did not want to have a lack of functionality then. I used to do a lot of photography 20 years ago on film, but returned as a point and shoot fotographer when digital came about. To say it with fellow countryman 'Arnie' - \"I'm back.\"First I need to say that all Amazon partnershops performed and delivered flawlessly, my special mention goes to Adorama Camera. I would usually be worried to spend so much money on the web, but Amazon takes that away. Now to the 'beast' itself the EOS-1Ds body. I will not go into all the functional details, as to my mind they are all correct as stated. The camera is great to hold and work with total confidence. But at first - big disappointment. I was unable to concentrate on working with a professional camera. I was too used to point and shoot and expected the camera to do it all for me. Well, it does not. You need to know or learn photography for this one. It is now four weeks and 2500 pictures later and finally there is only one reason for a photo not to be perfect - ME!Biggest difference to other products is the film-size 24x36 CCD and the ability to set the ASA film sensitivity up to 1250 on the fly rather than having to change film. Not always is a tripod at hand or the photo subject would wait until you set it up and then hold still for a 2 second exposure. I could not ask the helicopter pilot to stop the vibration during a dawn flight over the Las Vegas Strip. Setting to ASA1250 shortened exposure time to s/50. The picture noise that you get as a consequence is dramatically reduced by the noise reduction feature and much less than the grain of a high-sensitivity film. Cautions and recommendations: Learning how to clean the sensor from dust and dirt without damaging it is essential. This camera is VERY heavy you will need a strong tripod to hold it. Buy a second battery, even so the charging is quick and it usually lasts for two normal days of use. Using a CF card reader is easier than buying a Firwire attachment for your PC. Use 2GB high-speed Compactflash for convenience, it will give you 400 pictures in JPG. Feel free to send me questions, which I will answer as much as I can.", "Date": "June 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "Prosumer", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3GY92ALRN6VBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have shot 35mm for 30 years and paid for the best prints from the best labs and they just can't compare with high end digital prints.  The detail goes way beyond 35mm and easily challenges medium format.  I am still learning color manipulation on the computer and occasionally I get better color from a Velvia slide - which I am now shooting with the same Canon lenses and a 1v body - but overall it is becoming increasingly clear that film is as dead as video tape and vinyl records.  I traded up to the 1Ds from a D60, which also produced prints much better than 35mm.  The drawback to the D60 was a poor autofocus and a less than full frame sensor, which limits the use of wide angle lenses for landscape photos.  The 1Ds solves those problems and potentially makes larger format cameras obsolete at the same time.  The only problem I have found is that the 45 sensor autofocus setting does not work with a very wide angle (16mm or 15mm fisheye) lens.  For some reason, it won't focus at infinity.  Switching to the center only focus sensor solves the problem.  The 1v and Elan 7 do the same thing.", "Date": "January 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Holy Cow !!!", "Author": "Mad Dog \"maddog6969\"", "ReviewID": "R1P6875TJ94K39", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our rep brought an EOS-1Ds into the lab for us to look at last week.  I'm still pouring over the test bench and outdoor images with my jaw on the floor.  I'll never be able to afford this beauty, but if we see the technology of the 1Ds make it into the prosumer market, I'll make the jump.  Many of the so-called limitations of digital photography have been directly addressed in the design of the 1Ds.  For example, the small physical dimensions of consumer camera CCDs have limited the performance of many cameras.  It's nearly impossible to collect and focus light onto a small CCD with inexpensive optics.  Canon uses a larger size CCD in the 1Ds. That upgrade, plus having the CCD house 11 megapixels makes this camera instantly competitive with 35 mm film.  Note, I'm not yet ready to say it's the equivalent, but it's so close now that the few advantages of film have much less leverage now.  The future is here and it is now.  If only I had 8 grand in my pocket...I didn't have enough time with the 1Ds to get to know all of the bells and whistles, but did find it easy enough to use by just trusting my intuition.  I'm looking at the nice collection of Canon 35 mm lenses I already own (which will fit the 1Ds) and my palms are sweating.  Maybe I could sell a few of the toys I don't use much and eat macaroni and cheese for a few years?", "Date": "November 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Body", "Author": "Timothy Price", "ReviewID": "R2ODNMK8331QD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hadn't planned on buying a used 1-Ds, but the low price for a \"like-new\" body with low shutter count was too tempting to pass up. It's a fantastic camera, and once I learned how to use it (required reading the manual), I understand why the 1D series bodies are so expensive new. I have a 5D Mark II, but I have hardly used it since I got the 1Ds. Here are what I think are the pros and cons of the 1Ds given it's 8 to 10 year old technology:Prossolid buildmirror and shutter very quiet compared to the 5D Mark IIvery low vibration from mirror and shuttersuper-fast auto-focus with L-series lensessuper-accurate auto-focusfast, accurate auto-focus in shadows and on dark surfacesvery accurate metering moderesulting raw(TIFF) files need little adjustment even in our harsh southwestern sunsurprisingly low noise at high ISOwhen viewing results on screen with histogram, the focus points show on the image. I find this to be super valuable, because I can quickly check the exposure and focus without looking at the image in the full size of the screen.well balance and easy to handle given its size and weightConssmall, old-style screen that isn't sharp like the 5D Mark IImany functions, like changing ISO, require holding down 2 buttons at once while turning a dial, which is slow and cumbersomedoesn't auto focus well on whites and bright lights (searches)doesn't have automatic sensor cleaning (sensor cleaning is a manual process)definitely need a manual to learn how to use a 1Ds if you haven't used one beforeI you find a 1Ds in good condition with a low shutter count for under $800 it's definitely worth it.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent digital system", "Author": "Mr. T.

It is most definitely a camera for a younger man however because it's HEAVY, especially with the 70-200 f/28 mounted. I can't imagine lugging around the really LONG lenses. I wore it around my neck for an entire day during a recent shoot and conlcuded that it would be best used in a studio environment on a tripod, or at least a monopod. I have owned several 35mm film cameras and at least seven different digital cameras including Kyocera, Epson, Olympus (2 different models, C2500L & E-10) and finally  three Canons: the EOS 1Ds 11.1mp, the Powershot G7 10.1mp, and now the 5D 12.1mp. So far the last two have been the best for my purposes. The quality of course is in the glass, but the artistry is up to the photographer and so far Canon has delivered the very best I could hope for. EOS is an awesome system and the 1DS, aside from the weight is one of the very best.", "Date": "August 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Review", "Author": "Jerod", "ReviewID": "R1VBBOSPFXB992", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product.

Carpenter", "ReviewID": "R2MEPIJW7C0HJY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've recently learned some interesting detail that came from a talented amateur photographer.  A friend of mine from work, had done a number of spectacular scenic shots.  He thought to enter some of the better ones into a professional competition. While he had a good Cannon digital, (I believe it was a 7 or 8 mp) requirements for digital are 11 mp minimums.  While expanding the lower resolution is allowed, it would still fall a bit short (since it only allows a certain percentage).  It seems that professional film use cameras, typically deliver the equivalent of 20 mp. The proper film is expensive, and getting it developed is not as easy as taking it to the local Photomat.I know computers and software.  My programming exploits placed me for a time at Polaroid ID systems. Polaroid ID, (prior to its sale by the parent company in 2001) produced drivers licenses, and ID card solutions, for more than half the United States, plus several countries. I have a background in video games programming by training.  What I can tell you from this is that you need a fast processor to create, and store an image 11 mp in size.  Cannon's custom processor seems to be up to the task.  My friend told me his current camera used the same processor, and produced the highest resolution shots in about 1/5th of a second. This model does about three continuous shots per second.  While not quite film or motion capture speed, it's still good enough not to inhibit your creativity.If photography is a serious hobby, or you are a budding professional, this might just be your camera.  Existing professionals will probably make up their own minds on when to jump to digital, and what equipment best meets their needs.  Cannons entry here seems reasonable for a quality digital camera.  You may see many other cameras pump up their numbers in a race to get the higher resolutions. They seem to be bristling with bells and whistles.  There's a not so subtle difference with a professional model like this.  That being it has features for professional imaging and the speed of getting to that next high quality shot.The other cameras will raise the bar one day, but for now they are best used by non-professionals.  If you compare the camera's specifications, you'll find speed, and feature limitations on those cheaper models.  This is not the camera to take on that vacation to the mountains.  A good four-mega pixel model will keep all your family photo albums up to date.  If however, your vision for looking at the world through the camera's eye extends beyond that, this may be the camera for you.  BTW, remember this is a body only, you buy your optics separately, and it's not advisable to go cheap either.", "Date": "November 26, 2004"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "World's first digital SLR that can prove its images are unaltered, original files\nAccepts Canon EF lenses; 3 fps for up to 10 consecutive frames\nCompatible with Compactflash Type I and II cards and IBM Microdrives\nConnects with Macs and PCs via Firewire port (IEEE 1394 )\nBattery life has been improved by reducing power consumption; powered by NiMH battery pack", "Name": "Canon EOS-1Ds 11.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B1bAVQSxL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000087HCP"}}
