The camera is easy to use, has a good quality lens and good resolution.  Battery life is good and I like the convenience of the SD memory.  I recommend this camera to amateur or serious professional photographers.Size of the camera is nice (small) and it is easy to use.", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Lumix Camera Overall ever made", "Author": "William Lederer", "ReviewID": "RUJB129B13XFK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned and used five Lumix cameras to date and a dozen other cameras as well. In short, this is the best camera overall.  Perfect size, rubber housing, best control layout...  Sure newer ones have more features, MP, Wi-Fi, etc. but for layout and ease of use, this is the best ever.  Panasonic please take a look at your design again and inculcate the ideas of the FX 07 back into your thinking and quickly.  I am about to buy an LX7 but will still find myself carrying the FX 7 or FX75 with me every day.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000MW8GSO"}}
