As others have said, this camera takes very poor images for a 14 MP! Images are grainy, blurry, and at times, even out of focus. In the automatic mode setting, the color rendition is awful. Therefore, the setting must be changed to sun, incandescent, or fluorescent for every change in lighting, in order to even have a chance for your picture to look halfway decent. When you go to take a picture, there's about a one-second lag time, too, so there's a strong possibility (almost a certainty) you will miss that once-in-a-lifetime shot.When you first take the camera out of the box, you're all excited, because it looks great, is sleek, and has a nice, modern feel. I should have remembered that old saying, \"Looks can be deceiving\". This camera is nothing but cheap junk. After only four months of use, the plastic piece inside that holds the battery in place completely snapped off!, which completely rendered the camera useless. When I contacted customer service at Olympus, I was told to ship the camera to them at my expense for repair, and that would only be done if it was covered under the one-year manufacturer's warranty. However, the representative I spoke with strongly suggested that ~I~ was responsible for the camera breaking, and thus, shipping the camera back to Olympus for repairs would likely be at my expense anyways, as this was not considered a 'manufacturer's defect' and therefore covered by the one-year warranty. It made no difference that all I did was move that little plastic piece to remove the battery to charge it, as I'd done countless times before - it wasn't as though I took a jackhammer to the dang thing!I should also mention that I had purchased this Olympus camera to replace ANOTHER Olympus camera that had also broken. That one was an Olympus FE-340. That camera suddenly started turning on and off on its own. It would, of course, only stop when the battery was removed. And unfortunately, this problem occurred after the one-year warranty expired. When I contacted Olympus about THAT problem, they said that usually happens due to moisture, and I was more or less accused of getting the camera wet, when actually, the camera had been in its case, in a drawer, for a few weeks before I took it out to use it at a wedding.So now I'm stuck with two crappy Olympus cameras, both which I was pretty much accused of breaking by those idiotic Olympus customer service reps. Oh, by the way, when I called a local camera repair shop to see if they could switch out the one plastic piece that holds the battery in from the non-working camera into the working camera? They said, sure, we can do that for ya - for $75.... What the?! Raise your hand if you think I'll be buying a new camera that's NOT an Olympus one!!!", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very dissapointed", "Author": "Vegas Nic", "ReviewID": "R3V0IIJLGV4LX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was very dissapointed with this camera, especially for an Olympus. The picture quality was generally grainy, dark and not at all sharp. Some of the previous user reviews I have read stated these same problems and others said it was simply a matter of not holding the shutter button halfway down long enough for the camera to properly adjust to the correct settings. But even when adjusted, the pictures left a lot to be desired. I only had this camera for a couple of months before I gave up on it and purchased another brand.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "ok at best", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1ILNTDIJMFOP6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this camera to have over summer for facebook pictures, and for just memories. I received it to find out the camera had poor picture quality and was made of cheap plastic. After a month the camera broke(I did not drop it once) it would not turn on and would not charge. I would recommend this camera as a disposable camera if even that.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "OLYMPUS FE-4020 CAMERA", "Author": "rhlewis", "ReviewID": "R25Z8VK6C7CE6O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera is a bit too small.
