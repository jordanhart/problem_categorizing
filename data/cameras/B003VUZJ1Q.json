The camera is pretty slow in taking the shots too. That being said - the price is right for a 6 year old who thinks taking pictures is fun but has a bad habit of losing things. I would not give this to an adult - but would not hesitate again to buy it for a child.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sub-par digital camera", "Author": "JewishUsedBooks", "ReviewID": "RXBTG92YORDDZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The resolution is terrible. the screen display shows a grainy bad resolution picture.
