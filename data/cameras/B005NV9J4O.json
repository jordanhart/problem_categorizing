{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WARNING - Buy with Caution. Expect to receive refurbished units - NOT NEW - But still good system.", "Author": "amazon \"Sdog\"", "ReviewID": "RYZIZ5CIBJFYD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've ordered this unit 3 times.. from 2 different vendors. Each time, the unit was shipped used and damaged.  I suspect that vendors are buying semi-refurbished units from the same source, which is not good. I had to send each of the units back for the same problems.  The units were missing the hard drives and missing screws that mounted the case top to the case. These units all looked like refurbished units. The first two units had to be shipped back to the vendor, but I got stuck with having to pay for return shipping even though it was not my fault.  The return process was hell and it took over 2 months to get the first unit returned and another shipped to me. What made it worse, was after two months, I received a different replacement unit, but with the same exact problems - hard drive was missing and screws were missing. When I sent the 2nd unit back, I decided to order for a different vendor.  Guess what... the second vendor sent me a unit that was used with a missing hard drive and missing screws.I would be extremely careful buying online at a discount price (I paid about $579 for system only - no cameras).  Out of sheer frustration, I did not want to hassle with a 3rd return and decided to eat the cost of the hard drive so I bought and installed my own hard drive.Vendor issues aside. the unit itself is actually very nice. The features are very nice and I really like the remote monitoring capabilities. The ipad and iphone features also work very well for me.  For a system with 16 cameras, this is one of the best I have.  I use about 10 system for different properties I own, and SWANN by far has been most reliable for me. This system attracted me because I like the 16 camera setup and the very nice iphone and ipad app that i can use to monitor remotely.  The system is nice and easy to use.  I am very tech savy but needed help with the port forwarding. Fortunately. the Swann tech support team is very helpful (with only a few exceptions).  The system will accept most standard cameras without any problems.If I did not have all the hassle with used systems missing the hard drive, I would have given this product a 5 star. I like it that much. It's very reliable and setup is not too bad. If you are able to find and obtain a completely new system, then I think you would love this system. Unfortunately trying to save a few bucks online can cause you a lot of issues and frustration and a loss of more money if you have to buy and install your own hard drive.  This is not a product you should be buy online, and definitely not from unknown vendor.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Swann 16", "Author": "Duggans", "ReviewID": "R1XUGBRMWUXFE0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Swann 16 worked ok but the remote did not work. I put in the new batteries supplied but they failed too. Unfortunately you need the remote to program the unit properly. Instead I had to install the cheap mouse that was very flakey and on top of a ladder, connect a VGA monitor and program it manually from the front panel. Pain in the butt but I got it to work. If it's purchased as new, shouldn't every thing work like new? This one works like used with so so parts. Oh well i got it from Amazon. Who do you complain to on Amazon. On Ebay I could just trash the seller for bad parts.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.99", "Features": "Just add cameras to record and view up to 16 channels of high quality video simultaneously in real time\nSet & forget by recording continuously from 16 cameras for 30 days+ onto a massive 500GB hard drive, longer with motion detection\nSave time & have peace of mind by easily locating incident video, then trim & transfer to USB fl ash drive\nView live or playback on your HDTV via HDMI port\nRemote viewing is easier than ever to set up with UPnP (Universal Plug n Play) auto network configuration", "Name": "Swann DVR16-2600 16 Channel Security Recorder with Remote Access & Smartphone Viewing - White Box packaging", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MEHIhQywL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005NV9J4O"}}
