The flaw I had with the e-30 was poor performance in autofocus in low light conditions. The e-5 auto-focus is much better than both cameras (IMHO). I typically shoot in a studio environment so I rarely shoot beyond 200 ISO. However, I do shoot for postcard sales and the e-5 looks great in the color and it's very detailed image - really nice. The new processor is exceptional and the umph it gives to my Olympus lenses is un-believable. All in all I'm very happy with the e-5 and will now start selling off the Nikon camera and lenses.Nothing against Nikon, I used them for over 40 years and made many exceptional photographs. A year ago I was at a photoshoot with my Nikon(s)and realized that everyone is getting the same image - I wanted my work to be different, so I went to an Olympus.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Olympus E-5 is Terrific", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R2MJA3QGE11PFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Olympus E-5 is best of breed.The pictures are the sharpest I have ever seen at any resolution.  I am not worried that the image size is only 12 megapixels as I made beautiful 20 X 30 enlargements with the E-510 which only has 10 megapixels.The great thing about the E-5 is the pictures are spot on perfect in .jpg.  I never liked the extra steps, time, and storage required for raw, and the Olympus processor does a flawless job in camera.I never used white balance on previous cameras because it always worked lousy.  Olympus has changed all of that.  I recently did some shoots in rooms with different types of florescents.  The auto white balance was dead on in all of them, even though the flourescents were different color temperatures.  The auto white balance works equally well outdoors.  Shooting under tungsten light or using flash, I would suggest changing from \"auto\" to the apropriate setting (either daylight or flash).As for noise at high ISOs, the pictures are perfectly clean up to ISO 1600 and clean if you use a noise program at ISO 3200.The two best art filters are dynamic tone and film grain. I see myself using pop art on a very limited basis.  The best all-around shooting mode is normal, portrait is good for portraits to give a very true skin color, andi-enhance is good for shooting scenary shots.Great camera, highly recommended.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "E5 is fantastic", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Stimmer\"", "ReviewID": "R2LM3VMFI9A7IB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've shot with lots of cameras over the years.  Olympus cameras are an enigma.  When you shoot with them you realize that they have weaknesses(well publicized) to other brands, but you also quickly realize they have plenty of strengths as well.The biggest strengths are things that go unnoticed on a spec sheet:  Exposure, white balance, color reproduction, and image clarity and sharpness.  And a JPG engine that gets it right directly out of the camera so you don't have to spend hours making your photos look right.  You also get in body IS that works on every lens, and a superior weatherproofing system that includes the body and the lenses.The E5 is a perfect blend of everything Olympus has learned up to this point.  It's not on the cutting edge of sensor technology, or movie making abilities, but it absolutely delivers in every sense of the word.  Of course the build quality is spectacular.  You can take this camera anywhere, anytime and not worry about it.Picture quality is amazing.  It's hard to describe properly but the images have a clarity I haven't really seen before.  And I've shot with Canons and Nikons as well.Noise control is the best of any 4/3rds camera yet.  It's up there with a D300s and a 7D.  Not quite as good but not enough to make a real difference.It's expensive of course, but you know you want it so just get it over with and buy the darn thing.  It's worth every penny in my book.Great job Olympus.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "I can't believe I bought the E5, but glad I did...", "Author": "Harry M. Shin", "ReviewID": "R21RRU8JZWCD13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1.  First of all, to give the reader an idea of where I'm coming from, I'm not a pro but I definitely am a serious enthusiast.  Furthermore, I've used many cameras over the years (OM-1, Nikon film, Contax film, Xpan, Noblex etc... etc...).  I've also paid my dues logging many hours in the darkroom over the years.  In regards to digital, I've used various Sony cameras (F828, R1, 850 with the CZ 24-70mm), Olympus 420, 620, most recently the excellent EP-1 etc... I also recently tested the Pentax K5 with the 16-50mm 2.8 and I've briefly tested the Canon 5DII 24-105 L (I think that's the focal length);  my friend's camera.2.  I, along with many other Olympus owners, was overtly confused, dismayed with the introduction of the E-5.  I was expecting all of the things that we normally associated with a new camera:  higher resolution and basically faster everything.  However, after some time with this camera along with some time to reflect on my recent various tests of other cameras (notably the Sony A850 with 24-70mm CZ and Pentax K5 16-50mm), I've come to some personal (not scientific) impressions about this camera as well as photography in general:  a:  Just like in the olden days, I think we can now state that \"it's about the lens.\"  Sensor technology is at such a level now, that basically any competent person can create a very good image with any modern camera.  Certainly some cameras lend themselves better to certain situations (ie Nikon / Canon for sports or super low light without a tripod etc...), but in general--> give a competent photographer any modern DSLR and they'll be able to create great images.  After testing my EP-1 with 12-60mm (which essentially shares the same sensor as the E-5) vs Sony A850 and Pentax K5, as unlikely and frankly crazy as it sounds, the Olympus EP-1 and E-5 with the superb 12-60mm just is frankly superior in terms of image quality (at least at the base ISO of 200).  In the end, I had in my possession both the Sony A850 with the massive 24-70mm CZ and the Pentax K5 with the 16-50mm 2.8 and although I could have had either of those cameras, I literally couldn't purchase either of those cameras simply because in terms of real world image output, it couldn't match the E-5 with 12-60mm.  I know that it doesn't make any scientific nor logical sense on paper, but in real world shooting, it is what it is.  And, I'm going to assume that the 4/3 panasonic sensor (an \"old\" sensor) is not going to be in the same league as the Sony sensors (ie A850 and the new sony 16 MP sensor in the Pentax K5).  Thus, going back to my initial realization:  it's all about the lens and the Olympus lens line is just excellent (I currently have the middle of the road lens line (High Grade): 11-22mm, 12-60mm, 50-200mm).  b.  Since I'm going way long in this review, I have one other thought in descrbing the E-5:  basically it's the EP-1 / EP-2 on steroids... and that is not a bad thing.  I love the output quality of the EP-1, but it's performance is hampered in many situations (ie focus speed, terrible ergonomics when using a regular 4/3 lens, no OVF, slow burst speed etc... etc...).  The E-5 obviously address all of those performance issues while at the same time providing excellent image output.  c.  Regarding the wailing and gnashing of teeth via the faithful when the specs of the E-5 was introduced (esp the 12 MP sensor), the bottomline is that this camera is truely for those who are not swayed by the media and internet hype, but by true photographic excellence.  How many times have we read over the years bemoaning the MP race, only to see those same people then criticizing a new camera because it doesn't follow up the MP race?  Some folks may need more than 12 MP but the super majority of enthusiasts as well as significant percentgage of pros don't require more than 12MP.  Eitherway, after some commonsencial thinking and research, realized that I too was falling for the hype that more is better.  The bottomline is that if you have an open mind and look at what is truely important for your photography, then I'm confident that the E-5 will at least be there at the top of your list;  it was for me and I'm glad that purchased this camera.3.  Well Olympus for creating a true photographic tool for photographers.4.  Updated thoughts 11.2011:  The more I continue to use this camera the more impressed I am with it.  The main observation since my initial review is that this camera is superior to the PEN cameras.  Many have observed that the sensor is the same or similar to that in the E-P3 and I don't have the ability to prove or disprove this.  But all I know that the image output is superior to the PEN... and I have high regard for my E-P1 and now E-P3 cameras (note:  this is the case even when using the same lens such as the 12-60mm on the E-P3 vs E-5).  The primary issue that I'm trying to put forth is that there is a definite need / place for \"traditional\" DSLR, even if the sensor is the same / similar to other cameras.  To those to have no fear of living in the present and not following the crowd, you can do no better than getting the E-5 along with the high grade or super high grade Zuiko lens.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera", "Author": "A. Thompson", "ReviewID": "R36TW59PB9DLY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The E5 has been a very pleasant surprise. I have been an Olympus shooter for a few years now, including the micro four thirds E-P2. When I first heard about the E5 I was excited and had planned to buy one, then lost interest over time. In the meantime I was able to demo a couple of other DSLR cameras but none excited me, and on a whim I bought the E5. I am so glad that I did! I love my Olympus lenses and did not like the idea of letting them go in order to get a better camera, but the E5 with the 12-60mm, 50-200mm, 50mm macro and 14-35mm lenses is phenomenal. I could not be happier.The camera is rugged, and I've actually been able to (had to) take advantage of the weather sealing. It feels right in my hand and balances well with the lenses. But the IQ is wonderful - the detail rendering and sharpness are \"Foveon'esque.\" The colors are true Olympus. I'm pulling back from shooting RAW+JPG to just JPG (I will still shoot RAW when absolute IQ matters (personal photog projects, heavy post processing). But the most pleasant surprise is that the B&W; conversions are absolutely beautiful. I tend to shoot primarily for B&W; and the E5 is to my eye a wonderful B&W; camera. The detail and tonal range really work well together.I plan to keep the E5 for a long time; there is simply not much more that I could need or want in a DSLR camera system.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade from 620", "Author": "John A. Krumm", "ReviewID": "R3K99XDFSYSYAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you don't mind the increased weight, this is a wonderful upgrade from the 620. It shares some of the same image characteristics, the overall Oly look to the photos, but the increased detail is surprising. It renders fine lines, small branches and grass extremely well, and transitions later to the painterly look compared to the 620. Overall, the impression is very natural and photo-realistic. Colors seem a little more neutral too. Live view is faster and fully cdaf with all lenses, so you can use face detection even with the 12-60. The snappier live view performance also makes quick low-to-the-ground shots easier.Noise seems improved as well, though it's hard to say for sure in raw (not fully supported by Lightroom yet, but you can change the exif to E30). I find that iso 100-400 in particular seems better than the 620. Iso 3200 and up shows a fair amount of noise, so if you mostly shoot at that level, you might want a larger sensor camera. Build quality is very high, the LCD looks great. Video I find a little clumsy, definitely nothing great in how it works, but it's there and if you are careful you could take some nice footage. All in all a solid camera. Fun to go out in a storm and not worry about it too.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Image Quality", "Author": "Vlad", "ReviewID": "R172EGNSWQKA2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first and most important aspect of this camera - excellent Image Quality when paired with Olympus High Grade lenses.  Not only that, but the IQ SOOC (Straight out of camera) is pretty amazing. I've tried Canon 60D & Nikon D700 before deciding to keep Olympus E-5.Body heft and feel - if you have above average/large hands, this camera fits into your hand like a glove.  At least it does for me.  This camera is not small and it is not light.  Nikon D7000 is smaller than this camera.  But that is just fine for me - it is a perfect fit and your shooting finger rests very comfortably on the shutter.Control Layout - very comfortable.  I have moved from Nikon 8800 and the layout of controls is very similar.  You know the design is good when you can hit the right buttons in the dark just after 2 weeks of use.  The E-5 does not have a mode wheel on the top, like most DSLRs.  However, strangely enough, available button controls & 2 finger wheels do the job and the rest is easily changed/adjusted via the large 3\" LCD.LCD - excellent display and an almost infinite adjustment angles were a must for me (Nikon 8800 had the same type of dual axis LCD).  If your photography style requires strange and low angle shots, this is the only way to go (without becoming a contortionist).Weather resistance - you hear about famous Olympus weather sealing and see truly crazy stuff people do to their Olympus E-model cameras.  You can hardly believe it, until you experience it yourself.  I was able to shoot in a full snowstorm without using any specialized covers.  The snow melted on the camera body and lens and the camera performed like it was 80 sunny degrees.  You have to experience this to understand the feeling of freedom this gives to your composition.12MP Sensor - do not believe the MP hype.  I have tested the 18MP Canon 60D - E-5 camera blows those images away (if you don't want to spend all of your time doing RAW processing).  I do not crop my images - I compose them when I shoot.  So I do not need the extra MPs as a crop factor.  I have also printed my previous 8MP images up to 30\"x40\" with excellent results.  If you demand ultra-sharpness in your images - this is the camera/lens combination to have.Lenses & Auto Focus - Olympus digital 4/3 lenses are marketed as Zuiko brand.  I have never used them until I purchased this camera.  What you read about Zuiko glass based on my limited experience seems to be true.  I have purchased Zuiko 12-60mm 2.8-4.0 SWD and 50-200mm 2.8-3.5 SWD pair.  E-5 has a 2x multiplier (in 35mm terms).  I have not had sufficient time for a good report on the 50-200, but the 12-60 lens is pretty much beyond amazing.  It will be my primary lens - no questions asked.  The clarity, sharpness, extremely minimal distortion and the build quality of this glass is fantastic.  This is truly the best lens I have ever used and if you read various reviewers, it is one of the best lenses ever made.  The autofocus with this lens on E-5 is very, very fast and the on-demand instant manual override is a beauty.Overall build and feel - you've heard it before and it is true - the E-5 is built like a tank.  When you take it in your hand, you feel a complete sense of trust in this camera.  You don't want to put it down.  You want to keep shooting and become a better photographer - every single time.  It becomes a disease and your wife is jealous of it.I am writing this review after having the camera for about 1 month (and badly wanting to take off work so I can use it more).", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pinnacle for Olympus", "Author": "Craig Guinn \"olympusbug\"", "ReviewID": "R1HLY522TF450J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd class myself as a serious hobbyist and I've had the camera for a couple of months.  I upgraded from a early digital, to a 3030z to a E300, to an E-500 to an E-3 and finally the E-5.  I have about 25K pictures on file, 95% from these cameras. I use Adobe LR3 and Photoshop CS5.  I have 4 SG lenses, 5 HG lenses and 1 SHG lens, with more to come.I purchased the E-5 early at list because I plan to use it for several years and figure its worth a few extra $ to learn during the holidays.  I haven't read the other reviews but am active on the DPReview forum.The camera is a nice upgrade to the E-3 and fixes most of the niggling concerns with that camera.  I think the JPG rendering, ISO performance, Sharpness, Autofocus, metering, Dynamic Range and resolution are better than the E-3. If the DR is not better the metering is more accurate and the Oly tendency to blow highlights is pretty much corrected.  The RAW processing in LR3/ACR seems OK, but not as impressive as the JPG improvements which a lot of folks are going to now with this camera.The image quality is exceptional and I am a notch better photographer because the camera is better and more forgiving.

DeWitt \"Alaska Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R3LNWZ2745DZJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Olympus famously uses the Four-thirds technology it helped develop in its DSLR products. That technology defines both the strengths and weaknesses of the DSLR product line, including the E-5.The sensor in Olympus DSLR cameras is half the size of a 35mm frame. On the downside, that limits the number of pixels the sensor can capture, in comparison to a full-frame product. It also implies more noise than a full-frame sensor at the same ISO setting. The E-5 captures 12 megapixels; there are Canon and Nikon cameras in the same price range that get twice as many pixels. The E-5 can now shoot with acceptable levels of noise at ISO1600 (a four-fold improvement over the E-3). But, again, Canon and Nikon DLSR cameras in the same price range manage the same low noise at ISO3200 and even ISO6400. This is by no means the best low-light DSLR camera on the market. The E-series won't be as long as it uses the Four-thirds technology.But there are very real, very important advantages to the Fourth-thirds technology, too. The Zuiko lenses built to 4/3rds are quite simply the best DSLR lenses available in the world. It's not just that they are razor-sharp, aberration free and well-built; the 4/3rds tech makes them focus faster, makes them lighter and superior to the equivalent Canon/Nikon glass. The Olympus 300mm f/2.8 Super Telephoto ED Lens for Olympus Digital SLR Cameras is by far the best telephoto lens I've ever owned. Because image stabilization is in the camera, not in the lens, the form factor is smaller as well as lighter. The improvements to the E-5 play to these strengths.I've just finished a 17 day trip into the tropics, photographing birds. I used the E-5 for every shot. While the E-3 is a splendid camera, that I've happily used for years, the E-5 is so superior to the E-3 that I never broke the E-3 out of my gear bag.Some of those advantages:(1) Much faster focusing, and more reliable - although still not ideal - focusing in low light. Focus acquisition with a teleconverter on is especially improved, and it's now possible to shoot a bird in flight with the 300mm with a Olympus Zuiko EC-20 2x Teleconverter for Olympus Digital SLR Cameras mounted.(2) Greatly improved performance in low light. Noise levels are acceptable to ISO1600, where the E-3 wasn't much good below ISO400.(3) Improved in-camera processing. Images emerge needing much less Photoshop work. The level of detail is simply extraordinary.(4) Substantially improved multiple shooting, with a higher frames per second rate and a bigger buffer. There's some improvement in the write speed as well, so you spend less time waiting for the buffer to write to media.(5) Larger, more accurate LCD view screen. Pixel count and density are higher, and you can adjust the viewer for lighting levels.(6) Greatly enhanced user configurability. As someone who is left-handed, that's especially important.I understand that the JPG processing is especially good, but I shoot exclusively RAW, so there's little benefit for me. Art filters aren't of any use in nature photography, so I can't speak to that either. The new video features are fine, but not my primary goal.If you have an investment in Zuiko lenses, or want the best possible glass for your work, then the E-5 is an easy choice. Beyond question, you'll get better photos. If you haven't invested in Zuiko, then the E-5 may be a more difficult choice. But if you are a nature photographer looking for the sharpest possible images, and not shooting in consistently low light, then Zuiko lenses and the E-5 are the tools of choice.My very highest recommendation.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good camera with few faults.", "Author": "J.

Both my 14-54II and 50-200 perform excellently.Autofocus - AF-C performance on the 50-200 is better than the E-30 for sure - With the E-30 AF-C seemed a bit hesitant at times, on the E-5 it's mostly on-point (rarely it will \"lock up\" and not attempt to AF-C to infinity, but these are difficult shots, and once I MF the lens back into range it snaps back into action). AF-C with the 14-54 II is pointless- still too slow to track anything. AF-S with the 14-54 II seems to be a bit more sure than the E-30, which would stair-step its focus more than the E-5 does.The high-res screen is great, the art filters are fun to play with, especially since you can see their effects on the live-view, which is very cool.Controls seem about right, though I don't like how far to the left the AEL/AFL button is located.The battery still doesn't have a % usage or \"shot counter\", this system is so archaic compared to Nikon/Sony/Canon (I've owned/shot them all).Noise, in VERY LIMITED testing that I've done, is about comparable to my Nikon D90 - which is pretty good I guess, but nothing earth-shattering. Don't expect to get amazing performance, but in decent lighting, ISO 1600 is just fine to use (about what D90 does). Note that ISO 3200 is labeled \"extended\" on the camera's LCD when you change to this ISO. I avoid ISO 3200 / 6400 unless I seriously need the shot.(Added - If you need to bring up shadows, stick with another camera brand - The E-5 doesn't take to \"fill light\" very well from Lightroom (using TIFFs) at all, and my Nikon D90 is definitely better than the E-5 at this particular aspect - though the E-5's noise signature on properly exposed photos is still a bit better)Moire - So far I haven't experienced any, and I've shot photos that would have induced it otherwise. Note that I'm shooting RAW using Olympus Viewer 2.1, as Lightroom 3 doesn't support the E-5 yet.Live View - Still does mirror flop, won't take the photo without dropping the mirror (boo!).Video - Decent I guess, I really rarely use it - but I've enjoyed the clips I've done so far.Overall - A good camera. I think overpriced for what it is, especially compared to other, competitive models from other manufacturers, but I wanted it early so I paid the price :)Still, it's the only swivel-LCD, weather-sealed camera I know of :)", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Incredible detail & color. Built like a tank. Superb lenses.", "Author": "H. Manduley", "ReviewID": "ROMS8F1YKAH7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The E5 is an incredible camera that's flown under the radar due to the fact that it's not a spec sheet performer.While lots of manufacturers fill the spec sheets to satisfy the market, Olympus focused on image quality and system robustness. The level of detail and sharpness at 12mp is truly amazing! You'll see things in your photos you had no idea existed! Remember you can always blur a photo or reduce sharpness in post, but you cant add detail that wasn't there. Also, whats the point of claiming your body is \"weather-resistant\" if your lenses aren't? The E5, along with a whole bunch of Oly lenses means you can REALLY shoot in the pouring rain (done it), snow (done it), on a windy day at the beach (done it)... anywhere!For nature photogs this camera is particularly great. Super-fast autofocus, (true) weather and dust resistant body AND lenses, fantastic detail that makes critters of all kinds stand out, and 2X focal length multiplier make lenses reach farther! Also the added depth of field lets you shoot at lower apertures, which means faster shutter speeds, lower ISOs, and less blurred photos. Image Stabilization in body means ALL lenses are stabilized-that translates to more useable photos in all conditions. Effective dust removal means not worrying about changing lenses wherever.Colors and detail are fantastic weather JPG or RAW, which means less post production and more shooting. You can actually shoot JPG and not worry the cam is going to screw up your photos. Or shoot raw and squeeze even more detail out.Then there's the 4/3 lenses. With just TWO lenses like the 12-60 f2.8-4 and 50-200 f2.8-3.5 you have a system that can shoot in any condition with a 35mm equivalent of  24-400mm with incredible image quality. Then there are the amazing optical gems like the 50 f2, the 7-14 f4, the 14-35 f2, the 35-100 f2, the 90-250 f2.8, the 150 f2, the 300 f2.8, the Leica 25 f1.4, Leica 14-50 f2.8-3.5, and Leica 14-150 f3.5-5.6. There are also lots of mid-range and standard-grade lenses that perform amazingly well for the price like the 8mm fisheye, the 11-22mm wide angle, the 35mm macro, the 9-18mm superwide, the 14-54 standard zoom, and the 70-300 super-zoom that gives you 140-600mm 35mm equiv in one lens! Sigma also makes a couple of nice lenses. It's very easy to have a complete, reasonably affordable, high quality system with only 2 or 3 lenses. Yes, there's lots of cheap glass with the big two, but if you're considering a body in the $1200-$2000 price range why put cheap glass on it?The Art Filters are not a \"Pro thing\", but can be fun from time to time. Particularly, dramatic tone, grainy film, and cross-process.The articulated hi-res LCD is quite useful in some situations.The BLM-5 battery seems to last forever.Downsides. Low light ISO is not as good as others. The lower megapixel count compared to others means you can't blow up cropped photos as large. The 4/3 system is not as common as the big two, therefore you can't find their stuff at Wally-World and such. You'll need to go to dedicated camera shops or online. So if you shoot in low-light all the time or crop your photos heavily this may not be your camera. But if you shoot in decent light, or in a studio, or with flash for very demanding situations, and don't crop too much the E5 can deliver fantastic photos under the most adverse conditions.I've loved my E5 since I got it in Nov, and have loved the 4/3 system for years now. My favorite photography is nature for personal enjoyment, but also do product shots, occasional weddings, and family portraits for others.

Davis", "ReviewID": "R9XGW7LSQO7CC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera back in November. I have a history with Olympus cameras starting with the E-520, which I purchased back in 2008. From then on I've purchased the E-3, E-30 and eventually the E-5. In that time I've had the opportunity to see how Olympus four thirds has developed.Well, first off I'll mention what everybody should already know about this camera. There is a lighter AA filter in front of the sensor. As a result, lenses are able to achieve a higher level of detail missing from previous cameras. I believe this is a great thing, but previous cameras by Olympus were not \"soft\" by any means in my experiences. In the E-5 I have seen amazing sharpness and resolution when using High Grade and Super High Grade lenses. The amount of detail is noticeably better than on previous bodies, however I feel this will mainly effect cropping and 100% pixel peeping for the most part. If you're printing images at sizes of 4x6 and 8x10, the lighter AA filter doesn't do much for you in my opinion. However, if you print in large print sizes of say 40x30, you will notice much of that fine detail in print.The body is very similar to that of the E-3 and E-30. I found those both to be great bodies with buttons in the right places for me. The viewfinder is exactly the same size as the E-3. The screen is the main difference, along with some slight button changes. While I enjoy being able to use a similar body, I must say that I would've liked to see maybe a slighter bigger viewfinder or something. I have no problems with the E-5 viewfinder whatsoever, it's just more of a nitpicking issue. Overall, If you like the E-3/30 body, you'll most likely like the E-5 body.The image quality of the camera is excellent in within the ISO range of 100-800. Once you hit iso 1600 grain becomes more noticeable but is well maintained. At 3200 you have a lot of grain that is still usable and at 6400 I feel you're better off converting to black & white. The dynamic range is similar to that of the E-30. I feel I get a good amount of detail in shadows and highlights, however, in high contrast situations the camera will clip highlights. Underexposing an image and attempting to lift shadows doesn't always work as you risk increasing the noise from the shadow areas of an image. In my PERSONAL experience, I've had few clipped highlights. In controlled lighting environments (the studio) I've had no issues with the dynamic range.The price tag is high, but I feel you get quite a bit. The weather sealing of this camera is consistent with that of bodies costing 2x more. I've taken it out into heavy rain to shoot. I've placed it on wet sand to get a low angle beach shot then washed it clean under a faucet. I have much confidence in the build. If you are using HG or SHG lenses, I feel the camera is worth checking out.So what do I wish could be better? Slightly better high iso (I happily shot events using iso1600 and 3200 with no problems), slightly better dynamic range, a quieter shutter (for street and nature photography) and a quieter focus confirmation beep (for street and nature photography).All in all I'm happy with this camera.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super Fast", "Author": "Marlene", "ReviewID": "RODZ6UG22WJ2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a long-time Olympus user and couldn't wait for this camera to come out.  It was well worth it.  Olympus isn't kidding when they say this camera has fast focus.  In standard light and daylight, the camera focuses the instant I begin to press the shutter button.  Yet the shutter button still has enough tension I'm not likely to push it before I'm ready.  The LCD is also great.  Images on the LCD are accurate, unlike some other brands I've tried, that make action photos look great on the LCD only to look blurred on the computer.I also agree with what other reviewers have already said about picture quality.  I've shot Olympus, Canon, and Nikon- and Olympus has by far the best color quality and contrast (I always shoot using the \"Vivid\" setting).  Like other users, I typically stick to jpeg because the photos rarely need much editing for quality.  The pictures are also very sharp and detailed.  I shoot wildlife and nature photography which means light quality changes quickly.  I like that I can shoot in programmable mode when necessary and be all but guaranteed a perfectly exposed picture.The one-touch menu continues to be one of my favorite features on Olympus.  I need to be able to change settings quickly to shoot wildlife.  The E-5 makes it possible to change everything from metering to shooting mode in one quick touch.  I also like the durability and weather resistance.  While other photographers are rushing to cover their equipment in a rain or snow shower, I can continue shooting without worry.As far as resolution, I have a Canon 7D also.  I don't see much difference in quality unless I need to really enlarge a small portion of the picture.  Mostly, the 18mp photos just slow down my computer when I'm trying to edit multiple photos at one time.Overall, I would strongly recommend the E-5.  It definitely competes with anything Canon or Nikon has to offer in a similar price-range and quality.  The large, bright LCD screen, easy-to-use video, and fast-focus definitely make it a worthwhile upgrade for Olympus users.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "E5-End User Review by Owner of Camera", "Author": "Chan Teng Heng", "ReviewID": "R9VIR279IIA7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I now own three superb camera DSLRs, and one high end compact:Olympus E5~ I love the colours of the image.Canon 7D-dual processor and high fps. This is a balance of softer image and color, so I would place this between Olympus and Nikon. this reates beautiful portraits, especially for weddings. Look at the wedding photos I took of my daughter as the bride.Nikon D700-fantastic camera with high and good performance in low light. Also sharpest images of the three. Colour can be improved.G9- good images, light especially for travelling, but low light performance is still sluggish. LCD usage in bright light quite difficult.Why E5?-love the balance of colours compared to canon and nikon.-top of range, weather proofed.-fastest autofocus claims with 12-60mm SWM lens. (Put this off for at least 3 years, cannot resist any more).In reality, this is my experience:-Autofocus:I have used and owned e510 (best colors, light camera, in good light conditions)e520-autobalance was a problem, e30-hyped up camera, it failed me in dinner photo taking, and I sold it. Pen E1-great disappointment as it was the slowest autofocus I had, compared to all cameras I have used.The E5 is the best Olympus camera I have used (together with 12-60mm f2.8-4 SWM lens); even in extremely low light, I could autofocus. Surprisingly, the 7D failed in the autofocus, and even the D700 focus gave me difficulties under the same light conditions. So the E5 had improved tremendously, over the e510,520, In almost dark conditions, I could focus well.Image quality: because I stayed in Sands Marina in Singapore on the 49th floor, I had excellent views of Singapore financial district, the \"durian\" and the lighting. The 12mm lens gave a very wide view, absolutely good for landscape or cityscape. Taking photos through the bedroom windows was not the best way to take photos. I went up to 57th floor where the Skypark was. This floor has the highest swimming pool in Singapore, and the edge of the pool made up the horizon.However, taking night views of the city was not good, unless I use a tripod.Hand holding the camera for E5 cityscape night photography is NOT good. Day time photography is not aproblem-fast, sharp (especially with the 12-60mm f2.8-4 SWM lens).Lens: I used the 18-180mm lens and the 12-60mm lens. The images from the 18-180 is not as sharp, although the quality is acceptable for prints. Images for the 12-60mm lens, I can only say wow.Weight: the E5 is heavy for travel; with the 12-60mm lens, it weighs over 1 kg. I shall need to take my G9 when I travel to Europe for a tour.Autobalance: if set correctly, you can get very nice pictures. I am not sure why, after the E510, the autobalances of the e series cameras seem to be a problem. Day time photography with autobalance is not an issue. Good.Filters: there are so many filters in the E5, you can literally play a long time with them and still have not tapped the full potential. Three seetings and filters I found very useful.-Dramatic Tone: this is like HDR, where the bright sky and shadow areas are adjusted by the camera, and you get beautiful balanced images where sky and shadow areas are seen.However, this cannot be used if you are taking pictures through the glass, eg. the windows of room in hotel.-ienhance: this enhances the images so that images color and exposure are well adjusted.-diorama: this creates more saturated images.The three filters alone are worth the camera's prices.Video:unfortunately video is only at 720p, short of full HD video, and this resolution similar to G9, and below par of the cameras such as the canon 7D and mark II (The mark II sets the standards for the highest resolution and best quality video).Downloading of photo images on to the computer: Unlike the higher speed of download by cameras such as the Nikon 700 and the Canon 7D, the download speed of compact flash is slower. With SD HC card, class 4 memory card download, is comparatively very slow. The slow speed reminded me of the snail speed of the xD card used by earlier Olympus cameras. It is advisable if SD HC cards were to be used, at least class 6 card is desirable.Overall, the E5 is worth the money, for its fast focus with the 12-60mm lens, and the quality image. Its past weakness of focusing of Olympus cameras in now overcomed in the E5. However, the quality of image in low light has to be improved.

Steinberg", "ReviewID": "R1BYM6XCOAYHYS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought my E-5 in  June 2011, and have had time to become familiar with its major strengths and weaknesses.  I still own an E-3, which I bought when it first came out, but have not used it since I acquired the newer camera.  The E-5 produces noticeably sharper, more detailed images than the E-3 - this has been noted by many reviewers and users, and I agree.  However, the E-5's sensor is unacceptably noisy.  At ISO 100, noise is not discernible, but luminance noise first appears at ISO 160 and becomes increasingly more noticeable thereafter.  In RAW, the noise at low ISOs is actually rather slight, but when RAW images are converted to JPEGs it is conspicuous, and ugly.  It can be minimized to acceptable levels by reducing luminance noise in RAW and then, in Adobe Elements (I'm using Version 9), despeckling before doing any final sharpening.  Without despeckling, noise will still be present.  While this method will control noise successfully up to about ISO 1600, it adds time to the editing process, and I find it tedious and annoying.  I believe the E-5's luminance noise below ISO 300 or so is worse than the E-3's, and completely unacceptable for a camera costing $1600 or so.  I've seen photos taken at ISO 800 from recent Canon Rebels which are completely noise-free with no NR editing needed, and these cameras cost half of what the Olympus costs.  Furthermore, the need to apply noise reduction compromises the sharpness and detail of the RAW images, albeit just slightly if NR is applied carefully.  Still, the degree of luminance noise in JPEG conversion at ISO 200 - which, by the way, is (according to dpreview.com) the E-5's \"true\" lowest ISO setting (ISOs lower than this are extensions, and if used will supposedly result in reduced dynamic range - frankly, I'm not wholly convinced that this is noticeable) is simply unacceptable to me.  I originally chose to purchase an Olympus (an E-300) some years ago over DSLRs offered by the competition because only Olympus DSLRs had self-cleaning sensors at that time, and the prospect of manual sensor cleaning was distasteful to me.  The purchase of the E-300 inevitably led to the purchase of Zuiko and other lenses that would work with the four thirds system, and when the E-3 came out - and, later, the E-5 - I was too heavily invested in Olympus/Zuiko lenses to consider buying Nikon, Canon, or other camera (Pentax, by the way, makes fine cameras as well).  The E-5 is only for those who are, like me, too heavily invested in four thirds lenses to buy anything from manufacturers other than Olympus.  Everyone else in the market for a new DSLR should look elsewhere.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "fantastic", "Author": "Alexander Gomes", "ReviewID": "R3YFAZJ6JE8AJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "JUST RECEIVED MY ORDER OF AN OLYMPUS E5........BEING A SEMI PRO PHOTOGRAPER FOR OVER 30 YRS.

My first camera was an Olympus OM-1. It was an excellent camera. As the years went by I went to Nikon, Canon, Minolta, Pentax, Sony, Fuji. For a while I was a Canon buff but there was something a little off. That orange/yellow skin tone. The having to purchase the way too expensive lenses to avoid getting out of focus images. Then one day thankfully my Canon equipment got stolen lol. I was on a budget and a friend of mine told me to try an Evolt while I saved up to buy another Canon. The photographers laughed at him at the photo lab when he suggested that. He said to one photographer, bring me your Canon the next time you are here. So they set up a shoot out date. I was impressed that a 400 dollar Olympus was competing with a 2000 dollar canon and it did well. I thought better than the Canon. I ran and bought my evolt 500. It gave me 5+ years of solid service, it took two flights across my living room and two waves at the beach, one was direct on the camera. It kept working even though it was not weather proof. I noticed my customers telling me that they loved the colors of my prints, I was able to take my competitions clients because of the print quality. I was able to re establish my business. I made a mistake though, I then went and bought a Canon after my Olympus gave out. The camera sales guy convinced me. As soon as you mention Olympus they seem to get angry and try to convince you not to buy Olympus. I regret that Canon purchase. I have 20+ years experience in printing and one thing I loved from my old evolt is that what I saw on my LED screen is what I saw on my computer screen and what I got on my prints was just as good if not better. That was over once I started using the Canon. I tried a friends Nikon and it was the same. Inconsistent colors, that reddish/orange/yellow cast on skin tones, the soft focus and sometimes blurry pics. The guy who designs my albums and touched up my pics hated it, he said go back to Olympus. I tried one more Nikon and then I was convinced. I had to come back to Olympus. I saved and could not wait to have this camera in my hands. It was worth the wait. I love the feel, the speed and most of all the sharpness and quality of color. It feels great in your hands, sturdy. I love taking photographs again. I have only photographed a few events and a few portraits and I had forgotten how great it feels when a person sees their pic and they tell you how fantastic the quality and colors look. Back when I had my evolt my photographer friends would come to my shop and when they would see my prints coming out of my Epson they would ask me what I did to get such great color. I would tell them it was my Olympus and they would either laugh or get upset that I was using an Olympus. My touch up and designer guy now tells me...

Time passed, and the competition improved greatly.I bought in the E-5 in November 2011 as a replacement/supplement for the E-1.  I figured after 7 years, they'd developed a brilliant successor to the amazing E-1.  They didn't.  It's an acceptable camera body for 2007 and is a good match for the Nikon D300.  It's everything that the E-3 should have been but it's not enough for 2010.That said, it is able to resolve correctly to make the use of the High Grade and Super High Grade lenses, unlike the E-3, but more like the E-1.  In good lighting, it provides photos of a quality nearly unmatched by more expensive competition.  I recall this being put up against the best from Nikon and Canon and it was deemed as good or better in studio conditions at the time.  I'm not surprised.However, throw some bad light at it, pump it up to ISO 400 and it begins to show low light problems.  It's still better than the E-1, but just.  Comparing it to the Nikon D300, its ISO 1600 images look similar to the D300's images at ISO 2500.  There isn't a lot of difference, but may help you understand that it isn't all that suitable for low light work and neither is the D300.  However, if you need to take photos at higher sensitivities, you can get the shots.  That's an improvement over the E-1 or the E-3.This is definitely a good body, but it's not compelling for switching from another brand.  The newest E-M5 is that body, if they can provide lenses of similar quality to the Four-Thirds line.  The E-M5 has much better dynamic range and low light sensitivity.

The art filters are also a fun time, and I particularly enjoy using \"Grainy Film\" for kicks.

Olympus' flagship DSLR, the E-5, remains an extraordinary tool for the vast majority of photography needs.12MP is more than enough for 99% of image-making. But the E-5's 12MP are more like 16MP when it comes to the actual resolution potential of this camera. If paired with Olympus' best lenses, the outcome is all that one could hope for in a DSLR.This is a rugged, feature-packed camera that's dedicated to providing still images of the highest quality ... with realism, detail, brilliant color and almost jaw-dropping clarity. The construction is 2nd to none; fully weather protected and rock solid. The flip-out, rotatable rear LCD is very clear and sharp, allowing for accurate image review and effortless live-view shooting.The one area where the E-5 might fall short of the competition is high ISO noise. This is not a high ISO camera when operated at high-rez raw, 12MP. ISO 1600 is perhaps the safe limit. But that shouldn't be too restricting if you use fast glass, i.e. f/2.8 and wider. I routinely shoot indoors with the Olympus 25mm f/2.8 at ISO 400 and get clean, excellent results. If you're a high-ISO-at-full-rez chaser, this is not the camera for you. Keep in mind, though, that even some of the very best medium format digital cameras/backs only go as high as ISO 400! A workaround for high-ISO noise is to shoot at medium-size or small JPEGs (7MP and 5MP). So long as you aren't printing big ... or if you intend to post your images only on the web ... the noise is a non-issue when shooting this way. You can shoot at ISO 3200 without hesitation. The great thing is, the JPEG output from this camera ... and all of the Olympus DSLRs ... is excellent if not the best there is. I usually shoot both JPEG and RAW so that I can opt for the in-camera processing and save myself some work. I'd say that over 50% of my final shots are the in-camera processed JPEGs.E-5s will probably go down in price during the first few months following the release of the EM-1.

I just wanted a second Olympus DSLR body as a backup to my E-520. But Olympus no longer makes any other DSLR so I bit the bullet and got this. (The originally much cheaper E-620 is still available online, but for a whole lot more money than the E-5. I can't imagine who in his right mind would buy that when he can get the E-5 for a lot less!) Maybe Olympus are waiting until they've sold enough of the E-5's before introducing a new but slightly less sophisticated and cheaper model. Oh well, it sure does take great pics and has some really neat features that I'm still learning. However, though I gave it 5 stars, I do have some gripes:1. First is the neck strap. It's a piece of trash. The plastic adjustment slider broke by the third time I used the camera - simply from letting the camera hang down after one use. That, of course, can cause the strap to slide out and the camera to bite the dust. At $1700 just for the camera body, you would think Olympus could at least spring for a couple of stainless steel sliders. I just don't get it. If you buy this camera, buy a decent strap.2. The owner's manual is only marginally useful and just fails to cover some subjects adequately. The guide-book by David D. Busch for the E-5 (available at Amazon) is far better and I highly recommend it.3. This camera has a dedicated remote cable connector socket. My E-520 provides this function through the USB connection, so that meant I had to buy another remote cable since the one I bought for the E-520 won't work with this camera. Also, the USB cable from the E-520 will not work with the USB connection in the E-5 (this is actually a fault with the E-520, since a standard USB cable cannot be used with it, but can with the E-5). Irrespective of that, Olympus has not demonstrated any uniformity in some aspects of their DSLR line, which I find disturbing.4. The external flash and remote cable sockets have small screw-on/off plastic caps, that are sure to get lost at some point. A small compartment with a flip-out cover for both would have been far better.5. It seems all Olympus DSLR cameras imbed the caption \"Olympus Digital Camera\" into the exif data. That means if I don't manually remove it from the metadata in each and every image after downloading, it will show up on pictures posted on various online photo sharing websites. This is annoying since it cannot be changed in the camera. When you ask Olympus support about it, they get very touchy in replying. The bottom line is that they want you to give them free advertising. My wife's Canon does not do that.Well, enough of the griping. This camera does take fantastic pictures, and I don't even have Oly's high or super high grade lenses yet - just several standard grade lenses (except the 50 mm, f2 macro, which I have not yet used with this camera). It is ergonomically super and the swivel LCD is a real benefit over the fixed one on the E-520. I no longer have to lie down in the dirt to get the shot I want. The eyepiece shutter is such a simple but functional feature when taking a remote picture using the self timer - you don't have to place a hood over the camera in order to keep out stray light. Of course, I always forget to close that thing, but have not had any problems with exposures getting messed up as a result. The front and rear dials make navigating the menu or the direct button settings a real breeze. The dual record media option (SD or CF) is a great feature which I got used to on the E-520 as well. As to the video recording capability, I can do without it. My stand-alone HD camcorder does it better.So I think I'll keep it!Update: I have recently purchased the Olympus 12-60mm f2.8-4.0 high grade lens. What a fantastic outfit it makes when combined with this camera. Wow! Of course, when mounted on the camera, you've got a pretty heavy load around your neck. Don't buy the claim that this is a compact or light-weight camera, and this lens adds significantly to that weight. If I'm going on a long hike (which I do often) I carry my E-520 with the kit lens (and sometimes my 9-18 mm ultra wide angle).", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great camera body", "Author": "samp", "ReviewID": "RA6LCXAXBE76R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great camera body with comfortable weight, excellent grasp feeling, good support for CF and SD cards, and so many other excellent features.

I liked the new features provided by the E-5 and the it's auto focus capabilities.  I started shooting in my youth with the OM-1 and was always and am  pleased with their lenses.  I would have rather had an Leica S2-P 37.5MP camera but one has to be realistic.  Be aware that after coming from the light weight E-520  the bulk of the E-5 gets getting used to.

This is the BEST camera I've ever owned!!! I LOVE it! I have an Olympus Evolt 550, which I bought several years ago. I really liked it & will keep it for my back-up camera. I bought the E-5 mainly because I wanted to upgrade. It has a higher pixel count & the fastest shutter speed in the world. That's what sold me on it, because I have shaky hands at times & don't always use a tripod when I should. I did a lot of research & price comparison on this camera as well as others before I made the decision to buy. I especially like the fact that I can use the same inter-changeable lenses on this one as on my old camera. Everything about this camera is quality. It takes great photos, even with my shaky hands! I can really tell the difference between this one & my old Evolt-550 (though the old one is a very amazing camera also). With this one, I seem to get the shot I want with less editing afterwards. I take a lot of product photos inside with not so great lighting, but this camera handles that just fine! I can't say enough about this camera. I've used Nikon, Minolta, & a couple of other models. But I don't think they could take me away from Olympus after using Olympus cameras for the past few years. It's that good. Even in low light, this camera is AMAZING! It'll take me forever to learn everything about it & what all it can do, but what fun to find out! You definitely cannot go wrong if you buy an Olympus camera. They stand for quality, versatility, & professionalism. So far, I haven't found anything I don't like about it. It has a larger viewing screen than my old one, but I don't use it that much because I shoot through the viewfinder. I feel like you can get a better picture doing it the old fashioned way instead of just holding the camera up & looking at the viewing screen. All in all, this is a great camera & Olympus can definitely pat themselves on the back for coming up with it. Oh, & did I mention...it was the camera chosen to be taken on the Space Shuttle to photograph in outer space (because of the fast shutter speed)?", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, not an improvement in a lot of ways", "Author": "Tired of olympus", "ReviewID": "R46YU0252WBA6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned.Olympus E-500Olympus E-3and tested extensively the E-5Before reading know that the E-5 is not all bad news. I'm not going to poo poo on it and say it's all bad. The fact is Olympus makes a great rugged SEMI PRO model that is good as long as you shoot during normal sunlight hours outside.Auto focus: Is great its quick and reliable and only strays when dealing with low light conditions and even then is not bad.View Finder: it's still impossibly small and lacks a lot features that it's competitors have. But it's just a view finder.Image Quality: Good at 12mp very nice.Image Noise: So here is the Olympus E-3, and E-5 largest issues, and where Olympus did not just drop the ball but dropped off a cliff. The sensor is woefully inadequately for anything above 650 ISO. The noise in these two cameras in raw image is so bad that you literally must spend the 300 dollars for Light Room 3 to get even close to you money worth from it. Anything above 800 is simply just a dream.I've been using my E-3 for 3 years, and the E-5 was not impressive to me either. I will now give some opinions that Olympus fan's are likely not going to like.1. Olympus has decided I believe to there own damage not produce a full frame camera. Of all the companies in a position to do so and do so at a price lower then it's 3 largest competitors it was plain stupid for Olympus to put a new screen and new sensor into the same bad design and call it a great camera. The e-3 had a bad LCD and a really bad sensor, if your car came with bad breaks and no tires you would not buy a new car to get those things you would go back to the dealership and have them fix it. Frankly Olympus made some small adjustments to the design to make it worth maybe at the most 700 dollars on par with a rebel or low end Nikon.2. Olympus has not corrected any issues with High ISO problems if your planning to shoot any type of low light environment I don't care who tells you different buy a full frame camera. It's worth the money. Or be prepared to spend lots of time editing and only half as long shooting.3. I feel that Olympus really kind of owes it's customers an apology for these last 2 pro rigs. I think the price points for both were way over what the camera is worth. I literally could not use my camera to get the shots I wanted until light room 3 came out. I think to ask an E-3 user to shell out another 1500 dollars for the same Camera is absurd in every way.  This is why Olympus will never ketch up to Canon or Nikon or even Sony.So again Day light photography go for it, anything above 650iso. Save your money get a D700 or Canon Eos 5d Mark2.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0042X9MNM"}}
