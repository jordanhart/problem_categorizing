I normally shoot on a D800 and very specific lenses but purchased this in order to rekindle the first love of photography when shooting leisurely. Definitely feels digital and modern but very classic broad focal length. Hard to get creative with it being so wide. Guess it'll be a dedicated vacation camera as I feel that it may be best at capturing a moment from a spectator POV rather than anything else. Now that I think of it... all of Fuji's advertising for it was shooting vacation-like landscapes", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,194.99", "Features": "16MP APS-C X-Trans CMOS II Sensor\nFujinon 23mm f/2 Fixed Focal Length Lens\nHybrid Optical and Electronic Viewfinder\n2.8\" 460k-Dot LCD Monitor\nEXR Processor II", "Name": "Fujifilm X100S Digital Camera - 16321066", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Dj8hvKBIL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BTK6PI6"}}
