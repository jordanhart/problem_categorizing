{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sounded like a good idea ...", "Author": "Ursiform", "ReviewID": "RPDZV9DVKM7L0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A camera well under a hundred bucks with a 28 mm (35 mm equivalent) wide angle lens? This is rare in cheap cameras,* but you do give up on the telephoto end, going only to 140 mm (35 mm equivalent). So this is a niche camera, but one that would be good for gatherings and party use, where you struggle to get everyone in the picture. It also has the feature that it runs on AA batteries, so you don't have to be tied to a charger; there is good and bad here, as I discuss below.First, to be clear, this is a cheap camera. Very plastic, very few features. This is a snapshot camera for someone who's happy with basic snapshots. And, no, GE doesn't make cameras. As is the case with most consumer products, GE has sold their name and logo to low-end producers. The GE logo on it doesn't signal quality.I used to like cameras that ran on AAs because I could use standard rechargeable batteries, with the backup of disposable batteries in a pinch. That's what I expected to do with this camera. No go. I tried six sets of NiMH batteries, four of those sets freshly charged. In every case it either wouldn't turn on, or turned on with a warning that the batteries were discharged. It appears to be built specifically to run on alkaline batteries, and can't handle the slightly lower voltage of rechargeables. That means you'll be paying for disposable batteries with this camera. And because alkaline batteries drop in voltage as they are used, they probably won't last as long in this camera as in a camera that can operate at a slightly lower voltage.While it does take fairly wide angle pictures, it has severe barrel distortion at the widest end. (In other words, if you take a picture of a rectangle the sides will appear to bulge out in the picture, making it look barrel-shaped.) Some barrel distortion is to be expected, but this camera has it pretty bad. (Not surprising, I suppose, given the low price point.) It may not be too noticeable in snapshots of people, but will be obvious if your scene has straight lines in it.The flash is weak, and even close shots can be underexposed. You can expect marginal performance to ten or twelve feet. The macro is spotty. I got some sharp shots, but in other cases I watched on the screen as the camera went through good focus to out of focus, then took the picture. Outdoor results are fine for snapshots; I wouldn't expect that buyers of this camera would be expecting to make enlargements, which is probably a good thing.If you need a camera at this price and you want to have a fair wide angle capability, this camera may be good enough for you. If you can go to about twice the price you can do a lot better, and you'll be saving the cost of all those disposable batteries.* The sensor chips in digital cameras are more sensitive to the angle the light comes in than is film. That makes wide angle lenses challenging for digital cameras. So cheap ones generally don't go very wide.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good functions for a low-budget camera", "Author": "Layna", "ReviewID": "R2855IT0RN0H0T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My Sony DSC-P100 5.1 MP camera is from 2004 Sony Cybershot DSCP100 5.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom. It does video, came with a rechargeable cord for the lithium battery & a proprietary jack to connect with the tv. It used the long style memory  stick up to 1G. It is compact, looks good, but very complicated to use except for basic functions. It has a 1.8\" lcd screen, but a Carl Zeiss lens.ComparisonStyle/Quality in buildThis GE camera looks barely better then something a parent gives a pre-teen, it looks very cheap with plastic housing.BatteriesIt uses AA batteries (I was able to use Eneloop hybrid NiMh which are great) which is better then a lithium battery that you are stuck recharging at inconvenient times that will one day not hold a charge & then you're stuck tossing the whole device.)MemoryThis camera uses a regular SD card which is more popular then a memory stick, so it wins. Can even use a microSD with a SD adapter/housing.Start-up timeSony still wins by 1/4 of a second, though not enough to matter.Color/ClarityThe Sony runs towards the reds a little, but the GE runs to the greens. The GE wins with it's 14MP over 5MP though on photos it's not as obvious, you actually have to look a bit. On video, the GE wins much better on HD vs. 640 video. There still seems to be a bit of noise on the GE there isn't on the Sony when video was taking within moments of each other.Extra features:The GE wins with stabilization, blink, smile detection, though they both have red eye reduction. But in order to use those extra features on the GE, you have turn them on each time. The smile detection did not work though with me on non-bright lamp lighting.LCD screenGE wins on size hands-down on size, though the display is very dull & low resolution like a cheap, older no-frills VGA cell phone display. I immediately had to put it on 100% to not make it look horrendous. It does have a wallpaper & start-up photos that you can choose other then the default.Ease of UseGE wins hands-down.Dedicated buttons: power, video & big one for pic taking on top.Next to LCD screen - W/T, Mode, Menu (settings) & play (see past pics/play past videos).

It has many features of more expensive cameras: blink and smile detection, red-eye removal,HD video, image stabilization , 2.7 screen. I LOVE the \"pancapture\"for panorama views. You snap one picture, swing the camera until the square and circle line up and the camera does the rest. No complicated \"stitching\".You will need a flash card. I find the 8Gig ,6 class adequate.What is in the box? camera, USB cord, two AA batteries, wrist strap and quick-start instructions. You can go to the internet for more advanced instructions or, if you don't have internet, there is a contact address on your warranty card for a free instruction manual.In my opinion this is a well made, basic, easy to use, entry-level camera at a reasonable price. One year warranty. Made in China but isn't almost everything these days?I'm no expert but so far I haven't been able to find anything negative about the camera. If anything comes up after a few weeks use I will be back to update the review.***update: I haven't found anything negative about this camera. No, it's not a Leica or $300 Sony so don't expect it to feel or act like one. If you dream of a job with NATGEO or as top salesman in the best Buy camera department you might want to go a little more high tech. I think the camera is a good \"starter camera\" or for someone whose only interest in photography is taking pictures of the grand-kids, graduations, family gatherings. (you can get the whole bunch in with the panorama feature) The AA batteries are easy to find and cheap, especially in bulk or on holiday specials.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nices Pictures for an Inexpensive Camera", "Author": "Theresa M. Studer \"Terra57\"", "ReviewID": "R1N8K1GXGMV8OD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay to be honest this is a cheaper looking camera but it does indeed have some really nice features.  I have posted four pictures that I took with it and you can see how wonderful it picks out the colors without washing them out.  Here are a few things I really like about this;  1. It takes double A batteries which is nice especially when you tend to forget to charge a rechargable battery.  2. It has a number of different settings for taking photos so if you don't like one then just try another.  3. I like the USB slot better on this one that the camera's more expensive model.  Just wish there was a cover of the the slot.  4. The colors are wonderous without washing them out.  Even the blues and reds seem to be better.  5. The size is comfortable and not awkward.  Perfect size for pocket or purse.  6. Directions help make it easy to use.A few things I'm not so sure about;  1. Not sure about how long the battery life is or would be if using it for an extended period of time.  2. There was a little hestitation in opening the shutter and I'm not sure if it is because the batteries just aren't strong enough or it might be a malfunction.  3. Wish there was a cover over the USB slot so you won't have to worry about it getting all ickied up with lint and dust or what not.Overall, the camera is a good bargin for someone just starting out or for someone that doesn't have the $$$$ to spend on a higher end model.

Morim", "ReviewID": "R6G3NBC33O8LA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The GE Smart camera may not be the best camera you've ever gotten but for it's price, it cannot be beat.A 14 megapixel 5x zoom accompanied with a fairly good 2.7\" lcd screen is really hard to find for under $100, or even $150 if you go for a cannon or nikon.How does it compare then?Optics:in terms of optics, there's much to be desired, the photos could stand to be sharper and the focus could stand to be more accurate, but this issue plagues the $150 cameras as well.Features:this camera has a lot of them, mostly gimmicky, such as the \"face detection\" which works but for the most part just makes it harder to take photos and \"smile detection\" which is just plain silly. It does however have a few great features: the panorama assist feature works wonderfully as well as the adjustments for auto-scene which makes this camera perfect for non-photographers.Build Quality:the camera is actually built pretty well, don't expect a pro-like look, but the plastic pieces seem sturdy and the camera feels nice in the hand.Taking Photos:the camera has a considerable shutter lag which is to be expected from this level of camera, it could be quite annoying for a photographer that wants to take a few photos consecutively.Videos:The camera takes 720p video which is actually quite good!Conclusion:this is a perfect camera in the perfect price spot to buy for grandma and grandpa, or for the grandsons.it's also a pretty good choice for someone who wants to get a good camera with a lot of features for a good price and is not going to make an art exhibit with his photos anytime soon.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like it...", "Author": "Jill Tompkins", "ReviewID": "R10G7FPSA5SS71", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK- So first of all, I do have the red 14mp version in a box sitting under my Christmas tree, but have yet to use it.

Some of these reviews are so much more technical than I know what to do with! If you're looking for a camera to take pictures of holidays and celebrations and vacations and family, THIS IS A GREAT CAMERA! It takes clean, clear pictures. I've had my 10mp version for 2 years w/ no problems. And it doesn't eat batteries as some would have you believe. They last a good while. The 14mp is a Christmas present for my stepdaughter. I bought GE on purpose because after terrible luck w/ a Sanyo that lasted 3 months, my GE has been RELIABLE. Again... if you want to take close ups of the dew on a flower petal by morning's first light, and know what a filter is, or have a collection of lenses; this is not for you.

My GE Smart A1456W-BK 14 MP with 5 x Optical Zoom Digital Camera, Black arrived yesterday and I've been having great fun with it.  Set up was so simple that even Granny (yes, I can build a computer but I still can't program the VCR LOL) managed to accomplish that in less than 3 minutes sitting in the parking lot at the mall - without the directions, since I didn't have my reading glasses.  I spent most of that time attaching the carry strap.The list of features is long.  Two that I checked out (still couldn't read the printed directions!) during that same parking-lot wait were the 5X Optical Zoom and the Face Detection.  Result:  a close-up picture taken from about the 10th parking spot out of three recognizable individuals walking out of WalMart. I could even make a fairly accurate list of what one woman had in her cart!  And while not tiny, the camera is small enough to fit in a pocket or a very small handbag.  Even better, the camera runs on two AA batteries (included) so you'll never need to haul around a charger.It is a gorgeous day here this morning, so I'm going out in a bit to grab some pictures of the last of the foliage and check out other features (maybe I'll see something worth taking a video of!), but do let me tell you about my latest discovery before I head out the door:  The camera uses the same USB cord that my cell-phone does!  While I do have a Mac, which claims to not \"recognize the device\", the pics were easily grabbed, and the quality was impressive.All in all, this is a nice, uncomplicated small point-and-shoot camera that would be perfect for a first camera at an extremely reasonable price (currently $79.99).
