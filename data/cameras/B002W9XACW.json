For $94.00, It's the best camera i've ever seen. I couldn't believe that I only paid $94 dollars for it. It's screen is huge, the high definition, is better than you could imagine. There's built in sound, it takes videos, it's great. My friend has a camera that she paid almost $300.00 for and she didn't even know that cameras came with built-in sound. When she seen my camera she said, wow those pictures are crystal clear. (her camera is hd too) I got a great deal for a great product!", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak EasyShare M420", "Author": "R.

Her only complaint was that the on/off button is so close to the picture button however I didn't have a problem with it when I used her camera.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pictures are worth a thousand words! Really!", "Author": "AL", "ReviewID": "R2WGS821AY127O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If pictures are worth a thousand words, then get this camera! With lenses made in Germany, 3\" screen, video recorder, metal casing, ultra slim, and all digital features? How can you go wrong! Pictures come out vivid and sharp! There's so many features I can't even begin to explain each one! I'm actually still learning each function! They carry different colors for those wanting to choose other then the standard black, or silver. I purchased the red wine camera! Very slick and attractive! This is truly a remarkable camera! It is hard to beat and cannot be touched by others at this price range! Probably the best one I've seen Kodak make by far!", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Kodak EasyShare M420 10-Megapixel Digital Camera General Features: Color: Black\nCCD total pixels: 10.3 megapixels\nEffective total pixels: 10.0 megapixels (prints up to 30 x 40-inches!)
