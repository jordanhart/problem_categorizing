{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is a great little camera", "Author": "S. Arce", "ReviewID": "R1FZTH9SV5U3VH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera (in its previous model T30) last summer and it takes excellent photos and video clips.  It is very small and easy to carry in a pocket.  The instructions are easy to follow. I wanted the smallest one I could find with the largest screen (3 inches) so I could see the image clearly.  My car was broken into while I was traveling, so I replaced it with the T50 and it is every bit as good as the older one.  The red is distinctive, too. The photos print out in excellent color. I am not very camera savvy, but this fits the bill perfectly.  I don't have the time or interest in learning about the finer points of photography and I don't want to deal with a heavier SLR, so I plan on keeping this for a very long time.", "Date": "March 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Attractive, Reliable, and User-Friendly", "Author": "Vincenzo Francis \"S-dog\"", "ReviewID": "R3HPH0HH576PJY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow.
