After 2 weeks of testing I gave it a glowing review on their website.  How ever we have had several problems with this camera since then, all of which would be covered by fujifilm's one year warranty if they would return my emails or answer their phone.  We have been canon users for a long time before this camera and will be returning to them soon.  Buyers beware you really do get what you pay for in this particular segment.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$219.95", "Features": "Audio Visual Equipment\nCameras & Accessories", "Name": "Fuji - 600011995 - FinePix S4200 Digital Camera Bundle, 14 MP, 24x Optical Zoom; 6.7x Digital Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513u5dfnacL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008HBGYPY"}}
