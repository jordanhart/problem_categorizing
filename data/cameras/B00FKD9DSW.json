A couple of days ago I came across a detailed review and discussion of the E4 and its capabilities on a website.  I immediately knew that this had to be the Christmas present to myself this year.  Of course, not being able to wait I had to play with it and it clearly holds what it promises and then some.  The thermal/visual fusion feature is incredibly useful and I quickly found a couple of insulation issues in our older house.  The sensitivity really surprised me too.  I'm able to see residual heat images of footprints on the wood floor for several seconds.The only negative I found is that they really, really should have used a regular USB connector on the camera instead of the micro USB connector.  The micro USB connector is flimsy and the thick rubber cover flap causes torque on the connector when the cable is plugged in for charging.  There clearly would have been sufficient space for a regular USB connector in the case.  I am surprised this passed the design review and testing of such an otherwise very ruggedly designed tool.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "In case you were wondering...", "Author": "jorr", "ReviewID": "RZ5TQ6VHRHSK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, it's true.

They show up as cold lines 14.5\" wide running across the first floor ceiling. I found gaps where cold air is leaking in, a built-in bookcase full of cold air from the outside, a door that is not quite closed and leaks like a sieve, recessed lighting that has a few units that are not insulated properly in the attic, the flue on the fireplace is leaking. I could go on and on. This was just the first 5 minutes. The image resolution is not like a regular camera but I have absolutely no problem at all seeing clearly and instantly identifying what I'm looking at. I should have bought one of these years ago. It would have paid for itself many times over by now.

MOST DEFINITELY!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"cluckbang\"", "ReviewID": "R3IL4O1BLS1T88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My ranch style home was built in the mid 50s.  In spite of the latest technology heating-oil furnace and large amounts of insulation in my attic, my yearly heating oil bill now easily exceeds $3000.  The main reason is heating oil in my area is about $4 a gallon.  (In 1998, I paid $.90 a gallon.  In 2004, I paid $1.60 a gallon).I considered purchasing a thermographic device or hiring a company to do a thermographic survey for many years, but the price and complexity always drove me away until I heard about the FLIR E4.Affordable, simple to operate and easily reconfigurable for more specific and rigorous testing.After surveying the whole house with this device, I began to attack the specific areas and problems individually checking and re-checking my repair progress with the FLIR.  (In one case, a simple re-positioning of a door latch significantly reduced the draft around a door.  I never would have seen this without the FLIR.)Will the savings justify the cost of this device?  TBD.I've just got started and it's the middle of the winter season here.  I won't really know until I've made as many repairs as possible and experienced an entire winter season.  Many of the insulating improvements I plan can't be made until the spring and summer seasons are here.  If I can see $300 saving per year (or about 10%), the unit will have paid for itself in a few years, I will be more comfortable and I feel better about being an energy conservator.  I will update this review to let you know how things are going.Throw in the ability to find and remedy potentially dangerous moisture and electrical problems (Did I mention this was an older home?), the FLIR E4 makes this device ESSENTIAL for the typical homeowner.Imagine some future winter when showing a potential home buyer your home, whipping out your FLIR and saying, \"Watch this.\" as you point it at your neighbors' homes and then yours.  Yeah... I'm bad.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "yeah, it is an investment but... it's worth it", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2ZB0YW0PFTSZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This device is f'ing amazing.

I also used it to discover that the brakes on one of my vehicle's wheels were not functioning, because the disc was not hot compared to the other wheels, after driving for 20 min.  I've also used it hunting feral cats, watching deer and coyotes at night, etc... Very handy to find what the dog is barking at. I can easily see deer at 100 yards at night, but haven't tried farther distances. Please remember that my camera is modded to an E8 equivalent, so some of the things I use it for would be impossible to do with a stock E4, like spotting objects at long distances because the 60x80 stock resolution would be too grainy.It also comes with an impressive WATERPROOF carrying case (there is an o-ring around the perimeter of the case). It will survive being thrown in the truck with other tools landing on it!If I hadn't modded the camera, my rating would definitely be lower, but after successfully modding it to an E8 equivalent, I'm very pleased with it! BTW my camera was purchased March 26, is the E4 1.1L model and came with the 1.22.0 software version (which I successfully modded).I did call FLIR and ask a technician in the repair dept. if modding the camera would be illegal and he informed me that NO, it is NOT ILLEGAL to modify the camera because it is your hardware and property and technically you are altering the hardware (not the Flir software that comes on a disc or downloadable) after you purchase the unit and so you are free to alter/change it any way you like. However, you will void your warranty and the certified accuracy of the unit will no longer be valid. For example, you could not use the unit for certified production plant preventative maintenance reports, etc... Also repairs to the camera when sent to Flir on a voided warranty will cost $120/hr. with a 3 hr. minimum charge.Hope this helps!", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Well worth the investment.", "Author": "David Detweiler", "ReviewID": "RMTFVAYLZTL6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been on the fence to buy a thermal camera, so glad I did excellent product.

(Sometimes not apparent). The unit is really solidly built too. Tough rubber and metal frame can take a 6 foot drop apparently (not tried that!).However the best thing about this is if you get a model with firmware 1.19.1 or lower (basically Jan 2014 or earlier), it is relatively easy to modify the device's Windows CE operating system and unrestrict the hardware. This effectively turns it into a six grand E8 model. All the E range FLIRs use the *same hardware*!Google for EEVblog FLIR E4 and you will find what you need to do this. The mods on this blog actually extend features beyond the expensive E8.Pretty easy to get done and easily reversed if need be. :-)WARNING: FLIR have caught on and all hardware with firmware 1.21 and up are locked down and currently noone has released a workaround.One deficit... No external charger and no removable SD card:You have to plug in a micro USB to charge and get your files.I just bought a USB extension cord so I don't have to keep plugging directly into the board mounted USB slot to charge the battery and get the files. I also anticipate it failing eventually and the socket falling off the board.I may even open it up and solder it directly to the board and figure a way to mount the socket externally.Should have a USB slot and a charger for any device in this price range.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Thermography for the masses", "Author": "James E.

This, in addition to being highly useful for checking your doors and windows for leaks and checking where your attic insulation needs attention, is the coolest toy ever. As an educational tool it is fascinating, shows you a world that most never get to see. The MSX technology creates images that are a whole lot easier to interpret than the simple blobs you see on earlier cameras. The only complaint I can come up with is the case it comes in - very tough, room for all the related goodies, but it's overkill. The tool is built to take rough handling, a simple soft padded case would be plenty. The Flir Tools software is cool, as well, but could use some more features.
