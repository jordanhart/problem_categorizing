However I was surprise to find that the remote is 4 parts screwed together. I did not expect each piece to separate. I was kinda expecting to just remove the back from the remote and place the battery in its place and screw the back, back on. Nah, Not really that easy, but no problems and no complaints. I will buy it again. (o yeah...the battery that came with the remote was dead. so yeah i got to redo the whole battery replacing thing over. Beware on my battery volt reading meter says the GP brand of batteries.....are only about half charged. ( I have only tested the A27 & A23 sizes )", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Handy Remote", "Author": "J. Graganta \"JG\"", "ReviewID": "R3CRW3CPB04UAF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The remote is a very handy way to activate and deactivate the alarm system.  This is especially true if the control box is mounted in a location where a PIR or door sensor is mounted and will activate the alarm when trying to get to the controller to deactivate.  Range of the remote is adequate (25-30 feet) from the control box through wood walls.  The original battery with the remote did not last very long, maybe three months.  The battery is an 27A 12V battery & in my area is not common.  It is NOT similar to the 23A 12V that is more commonly used (and available) in some devices. The 27A used in the remote is the same length as the 23A, but it is a smaller diameter.  The 27A 12V was only available at Radio Shack in my area.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$19.99", "Features": "Add-on wireless remote controller for SecurityMan Air-Alarm system\nWireless Transmitting distance: \u00bf300ft (in open area)\nOperating power: 27A 12V alkaline battery\nBattery service life: \u00bf 2 years\nControl buttons include Arm, Disarm, Home Alarm(when in home), and Panic Button", "Name": "SecurityMan SM88X Wireless Remote Controller for Air-Alarm1 and Air-AlarmII - Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BN5bHzeNL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001O0DR0U"}}
