{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Vivitar - We make it hard.  Not for anyone over 10yrs old", "Author": "Christopher Card", "ReviewID": "R1S9KR7FGWL6KA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my daughter to take to a camping trip.  I opened the box and was disappointed to see such a small screen.  I first tried to turn it on.  It needed two batteries, so I looked for a battery compartment.  In the manual, it shows a picture of the battery compartment open, but NO instructions on how to open it.  I spent 10 MINUTES trying to find and open the battery compartment.  I was FINALLY able to get the battery in and turned it on.  I saw that the camera needs a SD card so I popped a 16 GB one in.  I turned on the camera and it says 'no card inserted'.  I figured I had put it in the wrong way, so I tried to pull it out, but it was stuck.  I spent 5 minutes getting it out.  I reversed the card and put it in.  I tried to change the picture resolution to high, but the menus are SOOOOOOOO confusing (And by the way, I am a tech expert, I should be able to figure this stuff out easily).  I was able to change the resolution to high and took a few pictures.  I plugged the camera into my iMac and the memory card showed up on my desktop.  I copied the pictures, but in the middle of the last one, the card ejected itself.  I was able to look at the pictures and compare them with pictures from my 4th generation iPod Touch (which has a 0.7 MP camera).  The iPod's 0.7 MP pictures were better than the pictures from the 5 MP Vivitar!  I recorded some video, and plugged the camera into the computer.  Halfway through the video (Which by the way was worse than the videos that I capture from my old Nokia flip phone) the camera ejected itself again!!!  I didn't even have enough time to import!!!  I then tried to install the software that comes with the camera.  The disk ONLY comes with the setup assistant, you need to be connected to the internet to download and install the app.  I clicked download and waited for it to finish, and when it did, I looked in my downloads folder and SURPRISE:  It downloaded a Windows EXE app, TO MY MAC!!!!!!!  The included CD says that it works with Mac (P.S.  I have a 2008 Intel iMac running the latest Mac OS), so why did it download the Windows version?  Overall, this camera is a play toy for little kids NOT a camera for anyone over 10 years old.  I just bought a Sony Bloggie (Which is shock/water proof and has a 2.7\" TOUCH SCREEN!!)  for my daughter instead of this junk heap!!  Pay the extra $$ and buy a bloggie!!PROS:A good plastic toy for little kidsCONS:Is VERY hard to set upHORRIBLE cheap plastic qualityMenus are ANYTHING but user friendlyMy iPod Touch 4g (0.7 MP) takes better picturesWorthless, shaky video, my old old Nokia flip phone takes better videoThe camera ejects itself from the computer before you will be able to import the cough cough (CRAPPY) pictures that you took with itThe included software DOES NOT work with Mac, only the installer does.  Even if the software did work I am sure it is as bad as the cameraTHE CONCLUSION:STEER CLEAR FROM VIVITAR!!!If you want a good low-cost camera, then buy a Sony Bloggie.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great buy", "Author": "Jaguar 90 \"Liz\"", "ReviewID": "R3AVT2OENSWX7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great little camera for the grandson.
