I want quality....but I do understand that any point and shoot is going to have some limitations.  It's wonderful to be able to grab the camera and shoot away without having to worry about settings.  The exposure compensation and scene modes will give you what you need for everyday fun photos.  I might even consider using this camera as a second camera for some of my professional photography. I spent quite a lot of time researching point and shoots.  I have Nikon professional cameras, so I do lean a little toward Nikon.  My daughter just purchased a pretty pricey Canon point and shoot..her pictures are below standard in my opinion compared to what I am able to capture with this little camera.Of course, you do have shutter lag....that's just a point and shoot....For the money this is a great little camera.

In fact I had another camera saved on my wish list so long that when I compared this camera to the saved one, this one had better features on every point! I love the ease of just pointing and shooting and still getting wonderful pictures. I recently went to NYC and took a bunch of pictures and only had to delete one!

But I had one big problem with it. Even though the quality is great, the shutter lag (time between pressing the button and when it actually takes the shot) when taking pictures indoors is too long. Outside theres hardly a noticable delay. And because I bought it to take pictures of puppies, it was quite frustrating, as the little guys tend to move alot. Also the delay between pictures is longer than I'd like, after the flash I get the full attention of my little subjects only as long as the delay. Some of its good qualities are if you forget to put a camera card in, you have the option to transfer photos from camera to card. It also has a touch screen, so when getting your subjects prepaired for a picture you can just tap the screen to shoot. I know I need a more expensive camera but can't afford it, so with some practice I was still able to get some really good shots.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!", "Author": "Roxy \"Roxy\"", "ReviewID": "R1EUCMBEXE4J20", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the more expensive Nikon Coolpix a few months before for almost 3 times the money.  I hated it, and began using my previous Nikon Coolpix that had cracked.  Then, I happen to see this one and for the cheap price, I took a gamble.  It works great.  I love how easy it is to use (the other one kept accidentally taking photos and was very hard to open and close).  This one is smaller and much easier to use.  I never did find the video button on my expensive Nikon, but this one is right on the front.Also, I love the zoom feature.  I've never seen one that is so easy to use and has access to this feature right on the front top right of camera.  You can zoom in and out while you are taking videos too.  And, when playing back the photos, in order to view them closer, simply move your finger over the same zoom button.  It's very light weight and fits into the pocket of my purse.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Little Coolpix \"plumb\"works for me", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "RJ7D1IO44XB84", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have had it about five months.

Steele", "ReviewID": "RXHKIAY1AN2Z5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was purchased for me as a gift so that I could have a small,portable point & shoot camera in addition to my Nikon D40 DSLR (which I love).  Unfortunately, I didn't use it until just after the 30 day return policy was up.  On the third day of a family vacation, after using it for two days, I pulled it out from the safety of my camera bag to use it, and turned the power on.  The screen showed a lens error, then it immediately powered down.  A friend, who assembles computers for a living,couldn't even get it to work.  About the only thing that I might have done to cause the lens error was that there was a small piece of fuzz from the camera bag in the lens, that I removed following the lens error.  The day before, I dropped it from a distance no greater than 15 inches, but a camera should not be so fragile that it can't handle an occasional minor drop or two. I am convinced that the camera was poorly constructed from the start.  After my vacation, when I looked at the pictures taken on the first two days with it, several of them had half of the picture missing, as if the shutter was stuck.When the camera was \"working,\" I was frustrated with the fact that I could take pictures by touching the screen; I found this very annoying as I accidentally took several pictures of my shirt, the ground, etc.I am extremely disappointed in the lack of quality from this Nikon camera.  I cannot afford to keep buying $130 one-use cameras, so I will never buy another Nikon point & shoot camera.

When it came time to supplement with a point and shoot - I obviously leaned toward Nikon for this reason. I purchased this camera for a great price on sale at another store & brought it home to set it up. I should have stopped there.CONS:- TERRIBLE BATTERY LIFE!!!! Used camera on vacation this weekend. After about 1.5 hours the camera was almost dead (the battery had been charged to full the evening before). I even had the camera set to shut down after 1 minute of not being used to save battery life. I was only able to take about 60 pictures before camera died. If you want a camera that will last all day without charging...absolutely do not buy this camera.- During setup I thought I would honestly break the screen. Buttons do not want to push without using stylus which is incredibly inconvenient. Also hard to cycle through pictures you've already taken.- Display screen would only show me the video recording minutes I had left - will not show me how many exposures/pictures I have left on SD card. Called Nikon & after being on hold while rep researched, was told that \"once you have less than 100 pictures left - the screen will tell you.\" Um? Not helpful or as advertised.- Picture quality is not very good. Outside with full lighting - it is fine, but indoors is just terrible - even with flash!- \"Auto Scene\" mode almost always picks \"macro\" for every picture - even when trying to shoot landscape far away. Not a very good feature.- Stylus hanging from camera strap is extremely annoying & could potentially scratch camera when in casePROS:- Outdoor pictures are really pretty good- Lots of options for scene mode - although cumbersome to get there on menu.- Pretty decent deal for the price- Small/lightweightI am headed back to the store today to return this camera & look for something else. I really wanted to like this camera, but just couldn't. I will pay a little more for better features or look at another brand (definitely not with a touch screen).", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "better than what i expected!", "Author": "rubberduck1241", "ReviewID": "R2XTJO827H3LGV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got this camera as a birthday present from my mom when we went to figure out what camera i wanted we were in Walmart little did i know it was touch screen! when i got home and found out it was i was super excited! everything is easy to use! and in all my experiences of cameras this is the best! it takes amazing pictures! i absolutely love it!! and i have even dropped it a couple of times and it has been outside in freezing cold while i took pictures and even a little water and it still held up! i highly recommend this camera!! i have no problem with this camera at all!", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix S4300 16mp Digital Camera", "Author": "Joy", "ReviewID": "R145E03SKZ2MMY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really like the camera alot -- I play Agility with my dgos and took it to an agility trial over this past weekend - takes great stills and very nice video - was quite pleased and impressed with the camera.

I usually buy CANON cameras because they are much more user-friendly. But the store didn't have the one I wanted to I bought the NIKON. It took me about 2 hours of taking pictures to figure out which modes would work best for taking pictures of the artist on the stage. The pictures came out WONDERFUL, and I was able to zoom in completely, focus the camera, and THEN shoot the video so that it could come out clear from far away. It was crazy how much I had to play with it in order to figure it out. I would have preferred something much EASIER. I really loved the pictures I got out of this, and the video was not too bad either. The sound quality was good but not great. The touch screen was a bit lagging. The settings were hiding all over the options choices. They are confusing names on the options. This camera is annoying, and the battery ran out in 3 hours... though I'm not sure if this is normal for these types of cameras. It was also aggravating that the battery must be charged while its inside the camera. RIDICULOUS. I should be able to charge it externally. I am a pretty savvy user of cameras and have had many of them over the years. So I was really discouraged when I had to use this one for hours before I could find the settings I needed.

I bought this camera in white almost two weeks ago. I had some trouble with the touchscreen so I decided to find out some information about international returns. I spoke to Ruslyn, a very competent customer service representative who suggested that I pay to return the item to them, since the camera had a defect, and they will refund my money for the camera or send a replacement as well as refund me the cost of the return shipping. Before I finished the conversation, the power went off.The next day I spoke to another customer representative, Taneisha, who I believe only has that job because she knows someone who deals with hiring employees. She basically told me that since I don't live in the US, I would have to pay for the return shipping. I proceeded to paste to her their policy on international returns and asked her if they had changed. After about ten minutes, she told me that they hadn't changed, but something of their fault would be me not a defective product, but only if I had received the wrong item.\"A fault of amazon meaning if we send you the wrong item.\"  -Taneisha..what?In any case, I told her that I had spoken to a rep (Ruslyn) the day before and I was told that Amazon would handle the return shipping. I pay then and they would refund it to me once the item was received.\"Thanks for holding, i went back to my supervisor with the chat from the previous agent and being that you were told that we would refund the return shipping, we will make a one time exception and refund the shipping once the item gets back to us.\"I had no problem with this. She asked me when I was planning on returning the item and I said tomorrow, which would have been Wednesday. Early Wednesday morning I get an email from Amazon with the subject:\"Your Amazon Account Has Been Closed.\"\"Hello,A careful review of your account indicates that you've requested refunds on a majority of your orders for a variety of reasons.\"I have NO idea what 'refunds' Amazon was referring to. NO idea.My theory is that they felt it would've been better for them to just close my account instead of paying the cost of my return shipping. Since my account was closed, there is not no way for me to return it. It's also the reason why I don't have the 'Verified Purchase' stamp. To add insult to injury, they still send me emails selling me that I have unclaimed Amazon MP3 credit.Now on to the review.My last camera was a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-W560 14.1 MP Digital Still Camera with Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) which I absolutely LOVE. The clarity of the photos. The sleek, shiny body with the gorgeous 3 inch display. The novelty of the sweep panorama feature. The beautiful high definition video. Instead of playing it safe and going with the new Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W650 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model), chose to go another route and try the Nikon Coolpix S4300 and I must say...I feel as if I made a big mistake.Though I had some issues with mine, the touch screen interface seems smooth but not as user friendly as you would think. The photos come out crisp and clear sometimes, but othertime, they're noisy from top to bottom. Low light shots are fairly good in the correct setting; I was pleasantly surprised.The auto-mode is a big disappoint. The camera seems as if it rarely wants to use flash..sometimes it makes me wonder. The quality of the display is advertised as 460 dots but the pixels are annoyingly visible. You see this almost plaid-like pattern in the display. It is beautiful but not much better than the Sony's 230k dot resolution.Video mode seemed decent from the screen, I felt as if since the display is low quality, that the videos would be beautiful in reality. No such luck. I played them on my HDTV and, to be honest, it was on par with the HD videos produced my the Apple iPod touch 8GB (4th Generation) - Black - Current Version. In other words...it's not good. You also cannot use optical zoom and record audio at the same time. The autofocus also isn't that reliable.On the plus side, touch shooting is a fun feature, and using the swipe of a finger to go through your photos is a great touch. What I've discovered is that touch shooting seems to be disabled when shooting in some scenes. Having 6x zoom is also nice though when zoomed all the way in, it's nearly impossible to get a clear, sharp shot. The one touch video button is also really useful.Overall, it is a decent point and shoot camera. I bought it for $99.00 on sale. I wouldn't recommend buying it for more than that. I would recommend the new Sony Cybershot W650 over this. Aside from having less zooming capabilities, it's a better camera in many aspects.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!", "Author": "Teri", "ReviewID": "R1SWZOXMMKB38O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I previously gave this camera 5 stars, but the battery ran out after not even 1 hour!!

The biggest let down i would say is the battery is a little hard to understand it is very unclear as to where it is, i never know how long i have left. This however can easily be fixed, i carry an extra battery and i have no problem. Another thing to keep in mind is that it has the capability to take 16 megapixel pictures, but as it happens i never set it higher than 8. 8 megapixels is usually more than enough since i am not making posters, but if you are its good for that as well.

That definitely makes it a little easier to find menu options.I have not read the directions that came along with the camera. I'm more of a, \"Let's push this button and see what happens\" type person! This is a very simple camera to use. The crispness of the photos is amazing. It far exceeds my old Olympus! I recently took a few photos at a local zoo. The fact that it took such wonderful, colorful, vivid, clear photos of the lizards inside their glass enclosures in a darkened room amazed me. My old camera would never do that.I purchased this camera for everyday use. I am a teacher and needed a simple, CHEAP camera to use at school and leave in my bag or purse for convenience. I think I found just that in the Nikon S4300. I will admit that I really was drawn to the red camera, but when it came down to it, price won out. The silver version was almost HALF the price of the others. After some comparison shopping, I committed to the silver because of the tremendous deal, just under $70!

Boyes", "ReviewID": "R1WUTBLOQ5M6OL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This particular camera was purchased as a gift and will be given on New Year's day.  I did purchase one for myself about 18 months ago and have liked it very much.  I did find that the number of features slows me down a little and I am confident that I don't get full value out of them.  One feature that I discovered by accident is that you can pick the focus/light spot by tapping on the touchscreen and in about 3 seconds it will take a picture with that as the focal point and the light and/or flash suitable for that spot.  That is a feature that I frequently use but did not discover in the quick reference guide.  I just wish I had time to sit down and read the whole manual while being able to put it to use at the same time - that just hasn't happened - my fault, not the camera's.The story on this purchase is that my daughter forgot to bring her camera at thanksgiving so I let her use mine.  The basic operation is intuitive and she was taking pictures in minutes without any reference to the manual at all.  She liked her pictures so I bought her one for Christmas.  Her previous camera does not have drivers for Windows 7 and she did not have a card reader to get the pictures on to her computer.  I am confident she will like the camera.One small thing is that I felt the camera overexposed a little on both natural light and flash.  It is possible to set an offest for either mode independently.  I set it to underexpose by about 3/4 of a stop and now like the pictures I get.  I realize that exposure to some extent is a matter of taste.  I have been told by photographers much smarter than myself that underexposed photos can be repaired, overexposed photos can not.  I don't do any of this repair so it really shouldn't matter to me but if I ever got the time to work with one of the photo analysis programs I would have pictures I can work with.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blurry Images", "Author": "English Teacher", "ReviewID": "R1TAHAKK0VWY2P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been fighting with this camera for a year now.

It is generally easy to operate and has several functions.  But, it takes terrible pictures.  And, no, it is not my unsteady hand.

I did not purchase mine on Amazon as I did not want to risk the product being damaged in shipment, but I bought one for myself as a Christmas gift last year. I was impressed with the first few pictures, especially the quality of the flash (I have always been a fan of Nikon's flashes, which was I chose this product in the first place). However, that is just about the only good thing I have to say about this product. I have tried not to hate it, using the excuse that I was just used to my DSLR and I had to remember that this was a smaller camera. Anyway, here's the truth:1.) Outdoors -- This camera takes great outdoor shots...in the day light...as long as the subject is standing perfectly still.2.) Indoors -- This camera does not take clear indoor shots at all! It doesn't matter what the lighting is, or whether or not the subject is standing still. And the bigger problem is, it only gets worse over time. I have had mine for a year now and have used it only 4 times and each time the pictures come out more and more blurred.3.) The touch screen -- This is more of a stylus screen. The touch screen will NOT work with the touch of a finger, you must use the stylus that comes with it, so if you purchase this despite the reviews, make sure you do not accidentally throw the stylus out!The camera is small and compact and lightweight and thin, which makes it easy to carry, which was what I was looking for, but the picture quality is horrific!
